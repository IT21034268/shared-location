1,Very Unreliable!!!!!!,"We registered for this monitor and received it for our baby shower and have had nothing but problems with it. It is very sensitive, we can even hear the clock ticking in our daughter's room but for no reason it will buzz loudly with static and moving the receiver makes no diference. This is not a good thing in the middle of the night. If I get within a couple of inches of it, the buzzing will stop, but as soon as I move away, it starts again. It is driving me crazy. Also, within the first few weeks of use, the main unit started blinking and would not shut off, so we called the manufacturer and they sent us a new one, but the new one still blinks for no apparent reason and is hard to shut off. I would not recommend this monitor to anyone and am planning on buying a new one in the near future."
2,Not worth the money.,"I recieved these monitors as a shower gift, and I am not very happy with them. Although the reception is quite good, they go through batteries like crazy, and the ac adapters kept breaking. I had to replace them 3 times. In my opinion, I think there are better monitors out there for that kind of money."
3,Too Much Static & Not Enough Range,"Based on the reviews here at Amazon, I bought this monitor and was disappointed. Too much static whether I'm using batteries or the adapter. And I have a small house. I didn't get anywhere near 400 foot range with it (couldn't even make it to my mailbox. Also, every little sound made the whole display light up. Also, the belt clip is molded plastic that is not flexible and does not actually ""clip"" (it hooks onto your belt) making it easy for the receiver to fall off if you bend over or walk fast. I was very disappointed to have to return this monitor because I loved having two receivers and the base, with it's roundness and soft glow, fits right into a nursery. I went with the 900 mhz 27 channel Babycall by Sony ($20 more). Much better reception (for me anyway)."
2,Don't waste your money,My husband and I received this monitor for our baby shower. We selected this model because it had the two monitors and the price was resonable. Well I firmly believe you get what you pay for because this monitor does not hold a charge. We have to have the monitors plugged in at all times for it to work. The batteries just dont hold a charge. The reception is good but we can't unplug it and use it around the house. We wound up throwing it out and purchasing a new one. Don't waste you money on this monitor.
1,Too much static,"This is unusable in our home because of too much static and other interference. It really threw us for a loop when we finally heard baby sounds coming thru the static ... while our child was feeding! We let our neighbors know right away to avoid any embarrassment.UPDATE: We upgraded to the Sony ""Baby Call Nursery Monitor - 27 Channel"" and it works beautifully... no static at all."
2,Get what you pay for,This monitor worked well for the first week after our son was born but then began to only provide us with static noise or a loud whine instead of providing us the security we had thought we'd be getting. We played with the channels and even moved the receiver to a different location within the nursery but nothing has worked. All we basically have is a $30 night light. Very dissapointing.
1,BEWARE!! Cheap for the price,"My husband and I had a wonderful (but used) moniter with our first child, but wanted a new one for our second. We registered for this one after looking at all of the ones at babies r us and target, price ranges vs. features. This one looked like the best for the money. WRONG! It only works half of the time, which is horrible when I can't even hear my baby crying through the receiver. It can only be turned on to about 20% power because anything higher will give a loud screaching or scratchy static sound. Once my 2 year old had turned off the base but the receiver was one and it picked up a dog barking down the street?!?! I did save the packaging and will return this monitor asap, IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY!! Babies r us has one that is less than $20 that works well, it's our backup at grandma's and may just come home with us next time."
1,The Safe Glow is Lame,After using these monitors for only five months the volume malfunctioned. We could only turn them up completely - or hear nothing at all!
1,Picks up clear radio station broadcasts,Monitor plays a radio station perfectly clear as though it were a radio tuned to that station. Terribly annoying. It is AM 1590. Check before buying whether you receive a station at this frequency. Be sure to check daytime and nighttime as some stations broadcast only during certain hours.
1,don't buy this monitor,this monitor dose not worth the money you will pay for iti bought it cause one of the workers in the store told me that it is a good one well i bought it and when i came home i tried it and it was far from being a safty moniter cause1-i can barely hear my son even when it is on the highest volume2-the first 2 days the monitor did not have static but on the 3rd day when i opened it there was a very loud noise coming from it i can barely or lets say i only heared the loud beem voice so i returend it
2,"Unless you like white noise, don't buy this!!!","My husband and I chose this monitor because of the 2 receivers since we have a 2 story home. We couldn't use it in our bedroom because when our son was quiet, all we heard was static. It was so annoying we didn't use it and finally returned it and got a much better one that we now love."
1,Very dissatisfied,"TERRIBLE! I wouldn't recommend this monitor to anyone. It hasn't worked well since the beginning. My baby is only 5 months old, but I'm ready to go buy a GOOD one."
2,Not pleased with the battery feature,"Purchsed this monitor because of the good reviews it had gotten. Reception is fine but the battery system sucks. We keep one monitor plugged in in the bedroom but have one that runs on batteries that we take with us around the house. This monitor chews through 9V batteries. I'd say you get 4 hours of monitor time per battery, less with rechargables. But what really bites is that not only do you have to constantly change the battery....you need a screwdriver to do it!!!!"
3,"Not bad, but not great","Our Sony monitor finally bit the dust after 3 years. Our son threw it a few too many times and the components became too loose. I read several reviews and chose this monitor. It is just okay. My problem is with the red lights. Even when my 11 month old daughter is quiet the lights constantly blip. When the heat or ac comes on, the lights rev up even more. Although it is very sensitive, it also has too much background interference. After more research, I am going to return it for the Safety first 3 room set. Then I will be able to monitor both children (and number 3 on the way)."
2,Not as good as the Graco Ultraclear,"We decided to pick up this monitor because it was low cost and had two receivers. I was disappointed in the range when we tried it out -- just walking through the house caused static, and walking out to the yard quickly went out of range. We then received a Graco Ultraclear as a late shower gift, and we tried it out. It is so much better-- crystal clear reception and range of at least double the Safety 1st. The Safety 1st will go back to the store, we're keeping the Graco."
2,Not worth the hastle!!!,"We recieved this monitor as a shower gift two years ago for our daughter. The night light was nice although we already had a night light for the wall. The parent units took 9 volt batteries that didn't last long and the range wasn't very good at all. The farther you went, the more staticky it was. From then on we left them plugged in so the portability was compromised. They worked fine for about a year and then one parent unit died. The second parent unit just died last night. For about 6 months they both acted finicky and would fade in and out of reception but still worked overall. The static was pretty bad for about a year though and drove my husband crazy at night. They did their job, but not very well. Having said all that, I couldn't recommend buying this monitor."
1,Tossing after a month,"I bought this monitor because we have a two story house and wanted to be able to stop having to go up and down the stairs searching for the receiver. What a mistake! A person moving around the room causes static noise and bad reception. The red light that's supposed to indicate sound is on the whole time while the air conditioning is on, which is all the time in Phoenix. I get constant interference and static and got NONE with the Fisher Price one. I'm tossing this one and taking my Fisher Price one back out."
1,terrible monitor -- only static,This is a terrible monitor. Do not buy it!!! All we hear is static and only once in a while does it actually let us hear our baby. Not a reliable tool at all. I was very disappointed and now we have to go and buy a new one.
2,Only worked for a short time,"I've owned this monitor twice...the first time was an older version which was great for the first 6 months and then one day just gave up working. The store I purchased it from was nice enough to take it back for me and gave me a replacement - the updated version which appears here. That one worked great for 7 months and now is just terrible...I have to have it turned all the way up to hear anything (not due to static - it only works on the loudest notch)...and even then I had to put a piece of tape on the control dial to keep it engaged (monitor was never dropped or anything to cause a malfunction). I loved this monitor at first, both times, but now - save your money and go with one that will actually keep working."
2,Yuck!,"these are very unpleasant sheets,they are rough and smell funny no matter how many times you wash them.I will not be putting these on my bed nor will I give them to a friend...now sell at a garage sale-thats another story:)"
1,SMELLS LIKE GASOLINE,I washed these three times and they still smell of gasoline. These were dry cleaned using older carceogenic chemicals. I would not recommend sleeping on them and breathing in the noxious fumes. I will try to clean them once more and if they they still smell I will throw them out.
5,Great Buy!,I love the quality and feel of these sheets!! They were a pleasure to sleep on. Definately worth the buy!
4,Beautiful Sheets,I really love the pattern and the sheets feel great to sleep on.These met my expectations in every way.
2,Not so great at any price,"I bought these sheets when they were the featured gold box item. After seeing the positive reviews, I expected high quality product. This purchase falls short of expectations. The sheets do have a pretty pattern but after a single wash they are coarse and very uncomfortable."
5,Terrific Sheet Sets!,"I had been searching for quality sheets for my new bed, and was quite shocked at how expensive they were! I ordered these because of their reasonable price with quality material and high thread count. I was skeptical until they arrived, and was thrilled with the sheet sets."
5,Just what I was looking for,"Great book, in good condition. It's just what I was looking for. Pretty quick shipping, as well."
3,More flash than substance,"According to the forward, this work was originally an appendix to the first edition of Evola's masterpiece, Revolt Against the Modern World. Perhaps that explains the curiously disjointed nature of this book.Despite Evola's obvious erudition, I repeatedly found myself wondering what his point was.This book will be of value to advanced students of the grail legend. Beyond that, I would not recommend it to someone seeking an introduction to the subject."
5,yeah,"who doesnt like the fugees? its great album start to finish, play it on the way to work almost everyday."
4,Fun but difficult,"This game takes a little bit of getting used to. But once you get the hang of it, you can't put it down! I wake up early in the morning to play with this game. The hard part is that there is always a way to jump over things or collect things. They are sometimes just hard to find. I recomend this fun game to kids of the ages 9 and up."
4,It's a big bad world out there!,"I bought this game for my 8yr old son. He got busy playing another game, so I tried it. I spend several hours playing and laughing. It is not only a game to challenge all age groups but also has some fun things too. My son has no more of a problem with the obstacles than I did, in fact sometimes he figures out the tricks before I do. There are plenty of surprises so you don't get bored. With the game codes, it enables you to clear a level and not have to repeat it the next time you play."
4,Fun and Challenging,"This game was fun but could get a little frustrating. It takes a lot of thinking, but in the end you always have fun. I would reccomend it to ages 10 and up."
2,Hard to understand,"I recieved this game for Chistmas, and I found it to be dissapointing. One minute into the game there's this mushroom that, try as you might, you can only get over once in a blue moon. When I can't get over I loose interest and end the game on purpose. The second level is even harder to understand than the first.I do like,though, that there are codes so you can start playing at the level where you left off last. I recomend this game for those who have lots of pateints."
1,Couldn't do it!,I bought this game for my six year old son and was very displeased with it. Sixty seconds after the game starts you get stuck in front of a mushroom that you can't get over. Atleast six people tried to play this game and only one person could occassionally jump over it.
2,To hard for kids,"I bought this game for my 10 year old boy, after few trys he did not wanted to play any more. My 4 year old like it, and made me play for him and i can say that i am very good with video games but this one got me, some times we try and try without any luck."
1,THE WORST GAME EVER,"I HATE this game. It is the worst game in the world. If I were you, and did not have this item, I would save my money and buy a better game. ( any game would be better then this one.) This game does not make any sense to me. Please save your money! Please don't buy this item!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,a frustrating game,"Its not my kind of game.Whenever I mess up on some part, I have to do a big chunk of the hard part over again."
5,Great,This book is great for any middle eastern literary student. It's great literary selections coupled with the insightful historical background make this a constant book of reference and review. Would highly recommend.
3,"Great Musicianshp, Zero originality.","If you have any experience with the underground (read: real) metal scene, you have heard this album before. Many, many times. Period. The production is fantastic, the music is executed without a flaw, and yet there is very little to get excited about here. If you are new to the death/thrash scene, this is a wonderful album. If, like me, you've been into this kind of metal for a long time, you will probably shake your head and reach for Slaughter of the Soul."
3,"It's good, but not THAT good.","This album is definately not G. Love's greatest achievement. I guess the expectations were just too high after the original G. Love and Special Sauce album. But I suppose its okay if you like that sort of thing. I say, if you like G. Love already, you couldn't do much harm buying this album, but if you are a G. Love virgin, start with some of his better stuff. We wouldn't want to spoil him for you."
4,"From Joe Pops with Love, G. Love","Wow, this is a fun album, I can't believe it got such a negative review. ""Small Fish"" is one of my favorite songs."
4,.......,Well i just started listening to G love last year sometime i never really had the cd but my friends woulf play it and i liked it..well i borrowed th cd from my friends and liked it..special sauce..i loved it..i heard the new cd philadelphonic and bought it about a month ago cause i lied it so much...but on both cds theres a few songs i dont really like too much..but oh well i know g. love has a lot of talent and i like him..
4,Madness!,Who the hell is Roni Sarig and what is his problem? G-love and Special Sauce are one of the few musical acts out there who don't pump out the same MTV garbage on a regualr basis.
2,Yawn,"I'm a great fan of G.Love and absolutely loved his first album, and I suppose therefore my dissapointment in this one was the bigger. This just feels like a tired attempt to copy his own brilliance, having forgotten what that brilliance consisted of. Uninspired is the word that comes to mind. Alright, not all tunes are boring. ""Sweet Sugar Mama"" is actually in old brilliant G.Love-style, ""Kiss and Tell"" and ""Tommorow Night"" are ok, but that's about it. If you're going to buy one of G.Love's albums, don't buy this one. I'm happy to say, though, that his latest - ""Yeah, it's that easy"" is as good as the first album, although different in style and not as innovative"
4,I was pleasantly suprised,"I was unaware of the artist, I really like his minimalistic steeped in blues vibe. Great acoutstic yet modern mix"
5,GREATEST RTS EVER!!!,"-This game is too good to be true. The strategy, the graphics, the sheer amount of units and the game's downloadable modifications/units. (Go to www.fileuniverse.com for some great modding & map tools, www.unituniverse.com for units, and www.tauniverse.com for advice on ""how to"" stuff & advice and links to other Total Annihilation websites).--I got mine from www.bigdaddysoftware.com for $35 BUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! At www.bigdaddysoftware.com you get the game and expansion packs, just no manual or $2 strategy guide (that got bad reviews anyway), for $35 AND FREE SHIPPING because its a bundle!!!!!!!---DON'T pay this much for a mint condition, it's ridicuosly expensive here. There are alot of other online shops you can get it cheaper from, like www.bigdaddysoftware.com/."
5,My Cougar is running great!,"Needed a fuel filter since I was replacing my fuel pump and my boyfriend recommended Wix, said they were the best, well, my car is running like new again! I will buy Wix brand filters from now on!!! Thank you Amazon for carrying this product!"
1,Not worth it at any price,"This is not a recently published book. It has been scanned in to Kindle format by Amazon and the back cover even includes a graphic of the library card. (And it's terribly over due). The explanation was that this book was being 'saved' as it was an older reference book on the topic, out of print, and now would be preserved for all to enjoy and use.NOT WORTH THE EFFORT and terribly over priced at 99 cents! TERRIBLY written with sentences that go nowhere, hang on contingent clauses and leave you more confused about why you bought this book than you were about the history of the time period before you started."
4,Adorable- but hard to find.,"I, too, had a hard time finding this item. Luckily, I was in the store looking around and noticed that there happened to be one left. So I didn't hesitate to grab it. It is actually one of the cuter of the ""In Flight"" items. Very detailed. I can't wait to finish our nursery and add this to the decor. However, it is extremely frustrating to pick out a bedding set (especially when it is one of the newer ones) and find out that only select items are available and no one can tell you how long it will be before they will be in stock."
2,Hard to find,"This is a cute item, if you can get it. I only gave it two stars because I also have been trying to get this lamp shade. I was lucky and found the last one in the store two weeks ago but when I got home there was a flaw in the material. When I went back to exchange it in the store, they were completely out. I have been trying for two weeks and they still haven't restocked this item. They have said that the are not getting their truck deliveries because of bad weather. I find it frustrating when a store that specializes in baby items runs out of a product for weeks,especially when it is your bedding."
4,Gripping and Riveting,"I really enjoyed Dun's first novel, ""Necessary Evil,"" and was anxiously awaiting publication of his second, ""At the Edge."" Once again, he has created two fascinating main characters, established an unrelenting pace which keeps the reader glued to the story for hours. Dan is a timber lawyer, bit of a tough guy, born to an Oregon ranching family. He encounters Maria, an environmental attorney, who was born to wealth and conservatism, but was reborn to become a populist, environmentalist, democrat. These unlikely allies are thrown together by an intriguing cast of evil doers. Dun's trademark chases are present in abundance and he has added a child to the mix, Nate. Nate brings some warmth and humor to an action packed thriller with a good romantic angle. Adventure thriller fans will love this one. An absolute must read!!!!"
2,a student's notes,"Authors explain concepts very clearly, but their examples are too easy and problems are too hard compared with the examples. As the result, you read the book, understand everything well, but have no clue how to solve 50% of the problems because authors just never mention how to deal with them. Example? They just touch Chebyshev's inequality briefly, but afterwards you are expected to solve problems that are never mentioned in the book."
3,A reasonable good book on mathmatical statistics.,"The book is not written in a way that is suitable for beginner to learn. Conversely, it also didn't cover advanced topics in mathematical statistics. This book is not a easy read. Comparing with other statistics books, other statistics books are either focusing too much on the application without sufficient description of the rationality or too advanced that even professionals can get lost. Good writers among mathematicians are rare, so for intermediate students of statistics, this book might be a reasonable ok book for reference."
2,Difficult,"I am currently taking a graduate course using this text. I find it difficult to work the problems while the examples shown in the text are relatively simple. Further, some of the theory is difficult to follow.I have taken five or more statistics courses, 3 being graduate level and made A's and B's in all of them. I am currently taking another graduate level statistics course that I can understand quite well (with book and lecture). However, I am finding that I am having difficulty staying in this class. If the book was better at explanations and examples, I would quite enjoy this class and feel better about being able to remain in the class."
2,the book for nobody,"if you are new for statistics, it is too difficult, if you are experienced in stats, it is too simplified with no emphasis and elaboration.A lot of examples are excercises."
5,On my all-time personal top 5,"Gabrielle has a great unique voice. Her music has energy, is funky and very nice to hear. This particular CD is often found in my car if I'm going for a trip and want to listen to a CD that inspires from start to end."
2,BOOOORING!,"This mobile is great if you want it to do nothing more than match your decor. It only lasts a minute or so with each wind up, the music is entirely too loud and it's pretty boring. It's priced to high to be worth it at all. $20 would be a stretch. I gave this product two stars because it does match beautifully and is cute, but that's it!"
3,Disappointed in the design,"I loved the way the mobile accentuated my babies room and brought everything together. However, I couldn't attach the mobile to my crib because of the design. I have a slat design and the crib has a ledge that goes around the top that prevents the mobile to attach, and the attachment only works horizontally not vertically. I would suggest looking at the design of your crib before purchasing this item."
3,"So cute, but not very practical...","I got this mobile, because it matched the rest of the Baby Martex In Flight crib bedding line, and since my husband is a pilot, we wanted something with an airplane theme. We were trying to decide between this bedding set and the lambs and ivy airplane set and decided on this one, because we loved the colors and design. I have been very happy with all the other pieces in the set, but this mobile was a little disappointing to me. Yes, it was cute, and the music played nicely for me with no problems. However, we could not get it to fit on our crib, which we got from babies r us and which was actually the very crib that displayed the mobile at the store. We did finally get it on there, but it was kind of sideways, didn't stay on well, and it scratched the paint off where we had it on. I'm giving it three stars only because it's so cute. I would probably still get it, but I think they need to make a better design."
3,Does not last long,"I really do like the mobile and it goes great with the In Flight Set. But, after winding it up all the way it lasts for about a minute. For the price I expected more."
3,Cute but WAY too expensive!,"I love the look of the mobile and it matches the set, but holy cow! $40 dollars for a WIND UP? (only lasts about one minute then you have to wind AGAIN!)My son does love it so I'm glad I purchased it -however, there were no directions in the packaging and I had to figure it out myself."
3,"It's okay, but......................","I loved this mobile like everyone else because it matched the bedding. I totally agree with those that say you constantly have to wind this thing up. It really doesn't last long enough to sooth a baby! My son loved it (he's 10 months old and we had to take it down because he started standing in his crib). The only other problem I had was that it didn't fit my crib properly (my husband ""rigged"" it up!). They should manufacture mobiles to adjust to the many widths of crib railings these days. All in all...I liked it, but just wish that it would have played longer! Oh...and they never got stuck like the others said...they rotated just fine!"
2,Diappointed,This mobile is great for decoration only. It is way too expensive. It broke easily and was not very stimulating. I was very disappointed due to the amount paid.
3,I expected more,"I got this as a shower gift to go with the rest of the set... and am not happy at all!I expected MUCH more for FOURTY dollars...This thing is sooo annoying to wind-up, every 5 seconds... it seems to turn off right when my 3 month old may drift to sleep, and when it stops, it startles him and hes just as awake as if its afternoon!! The planes get tangled and the spinning sometimes gets ""stuck""Its also not ""fun"" to look at, so even though my son liked it, I am giving up and buying a new one, one that doesnt wind up, and next time I will skip the nursery themed mobile and move straight for the better models! (although with my 2 year old, his nursery themed mobile was great!)"
2,doesn't fit the crib!,"We love the mobile because it is cute, but it will not fit most convertible cribs because the plastic piece that attaches to the crib is too narrow! You do not get to alter the plastic piece at all, as it is molded to be one size. Therefore, my husband had to attach it to the CEILING with fishing wire. Our crib is nothing fancy, it is one that you can buy at any major retailer and is a convertible crib. The side moldings are just too wide to accomodate this mobile. The mobile should come with an adjustable mounting arm instead."
2,"beautiful mobile, very disappointing effects!!","I loved the classic look of the In Flight Mobile, however I was very disappointed that the airplanes themselves get stuck as the move around. I have to stand and make sure they don't get stuck while it is playing. I would not buy this product again."
4,Felt it the next day!,"I am a huge fan of Violet Zaki. I love the way she cues and her moves are fun and effective. The only drawback to this workout (for me anyway) was that the cardio portion was not intense enough. Not a waste of time by any means, but I wasn't sweating the way I would have liked to have been. Loved the sculpting section!"
5,Tough workout...she means business!,"The intent of the video is to have an aerobic challenge and possibly lose some weight. What I like most about the video is the two levels of difficultly shown. The person in the lead has excellent form, but her associate does an easier version of the same exercise. That way you have two levels of difficulty to choose from.I have not used the video enough to know if it affects my weight, but it did get me into good shape. I was sweating and running to keep up with her, but did not feel it was impossible. Definitely a good balance when buying a video to challenge you.Over the 40 min workout, it was easy to follow her steps. There is only one part in when she shifts a lot that it got a little confusing. It didn't matter so much, since you were still getting exercise."
2,Abdominal work too extensive for compromised back,"I bought this because of a preview included with another DVD. Preview showed a great Combination of aerobics and approachable sculpt, with a small amount of very minor core work. Even though I do regular moderate core work on my own, I found the sculpt to be mostly abdominal, of which is too difficult for a beginner or someone with a bad back."
4,Workout,I liked it and it is a hard workout and works all your muscles be expected to come and workout.
4,Great workouts- Short and sweet!,Great workout out for days you don't have time! Short and sweet! Even on days I don't feel like working out...
4,Great workout in short amount of time,"This DVD gives you two different workouts that really get you moving. I feel like I get a complete body workout in just 34 minutes. I alternate them so I don't get bored and keeps me on my toes. Violet Zaki is a pro in teaching-she's easy to understand, gives an explanation of what and why the exercise is important."
2,For Beginners Only,"I bought this DVD because of the great reviews; however, it is too easy for someone at an intermediate level. I do think it is the perfect program for a beginner to start with. I think the workout is fun and creative, I just found it too easy and I didn't even break a sweat."
4,A strengthening workout.,"I really appreciate the fact that others take time to share their experiences of fitness videos, because I always refer to them before I make a purchase. I think that the 'one star' review of this item may be unfair. If you use 5 pound weights (the instructor recommends 3 or 5 pound), complete the entire workout as well as the abdominal section, then you will feel challenged, but not depleted. Ms Zaki's pacing is impeccable and she intermittently pauses for deep breathing and recovery.This is an excellent addition to your workout library, if you're not looking for the 'bootcamp' experience."
3,Not quite fabulous.,I felt it was boring. I just watched/followed it one time and that's it. I just enrolled to the gym.
2,Just average workout,The thought that Violet Zaki ever had an ounce of fat on her body is implausible given her shockingly anorexic appearance. She is so thin that it distracts from the whole workout. I found the workout to be very run-of-the-mill gym fare and have been happily using Jillian Michael's workout 30-day shred with a much harder workout and finally some results. Pass on this video if you are serious about getting fit.
5,An excellent addition to DVD workout libraries,"The ""Weight Loss"" series of user-friendly fitness DVDs debuts. ""Weight Loss Cardio Sculpt with Violet Zaki"" includes both cardio and strength training in a vigorous routine meant to fire up one's metabolism. Since successful weight loss also depends on improving the quality of one's diet, this DVDs has bonus advice and recipes from the magazine ""Cooking Light"". There is also a brief bonus segment focusing on abdominal muscles. An excellent addition to DVD workout libraries."
2,Not much difference,"It feels creamy and thankfully doesn't have a smell, but I did not notice a difference after two months."
1,Absolute waste of money,"http://www.amazon.com/Roche-Posay-Active-Anti-Wrinkle-Dermatological-Treatment/dp/B000IOBEZS/ref=pd_sim_hpc_2It irritated my skin and made it even dryer than before. I thought it was an initial reaction , and it should go away. I used the whole tube. No difference except for noticeably drier skin."
4,"Excellent read, so-so ending","I read other reviews on this book and decided to give it a try. I was NOT disappointed. I read it in two days and found it hard to put down when I had to. It definitely grabs you and keeps you wondering throughout the book. There is just enough revealed to keep your appetite whet. As someone else said, the ending was the only thing that left me wanting. I would have like something a bit more creative. It seemed like there was such a build up to a so-so ending. However, it is still well worth the read. I highly recommend it."
4,Nice book...,"Well written, nice story, excellent tale. Was overall impressed... Wasn't sure what to expect, but overall a good effort. Well done. :)"
4,A very fast and easy read.,I really liked reading this book. I didn't want to put it down--the end of each chapter made me want to continue.My only complaint is that it ended too fast. It didn't tie everything together as well as it could.But the characters were easy to relate to and feel passion for. I wouldn't mind seeing this become a movie some day.
4,Strange but Wonderful,"I loved John Searles first novel Boy Still Missing, and I am pleased to say that I was not disappointed with his second foray into fiction. Welcome to the unhappy world of the Chase family. The tragic death of the youngest son Ronnie five years earlier has shaken their lives to the core, but that's just the beginning of the bizarre path they are about to follow. I won't reiterate the plot, suffice to say the author keeps the reader so unsettled and engaged that it is difficult to put this one down. The characters here are beautifully drawn. It speaks to the author's talent that we come to care deeply not only about the main players, but also about the secondary characters, even though we are given only a brief glimpse into their lives. The only thing preventing me from giving this novel 5 stars was unfortunatly the ending felt somewhat rushed. That small issue aside, this is one of the best reads of 2004. 4.5 stars."
4,i liked this book more and more as i read,"i have to admit that, at first, i was put off by the structure of this novel. while i appreciated seeing the story from different points of view, those shifts in combination with episodes that were out of chronological order and a somewhat meandering narrative detracted from a good premise. it was like the story was too amorphous for too long.this book, however, gains more momentum as you read and builds to a fantastic, satisfying finale. the characters are very interesting and the revelations will stun you.if this book had been more crisply edited and/or written in the first 100 pages or so, i wouldn't hesitate to give it 5 stars. nevertheless, stick with it and you'll appreciate the payoff."
1,Breakout!,"I used this product once and my entire forehead broke out into at least 50 whiteheads. I had not had a whitehead on my forehead in over 10 years at that point (I'm 33). Needless to say, I never used it again. I was using the Almay line smoothing foundation. I went to a Mary Kay party and was convinced that Mary Kay was the best so I tried it. Besides the breakout, the coverage was thick and very matte looking. The Almay's coverage is much lighter, yet covers better. This foundation is not for me! I still have the entire tube left if anybody wants it."
4,Shadowy Horses,Another great book by Kearsley. It was a little slow in the beginning but it ended strong. She builds such strong characters!
3,The Shadowy Horses,"This is the first book by this author that I've read. I had heard wonderful things about her books but I can not help feeling just a tiny bit disappointed. It may not have been ""the book"" to start with. I have to say that I liked the premise of the story. The ghost of The Sentinel was captivating and I really, really enjoyed the mystical flavors of the book. I would have very much appreciated more background on The Sentinal.I thought that the characters were a bit wishy washy. For me it was Peter Quinnell who stood out. When the present day mystery was unravelled and the culprit revealed - it was a little too pat for my liking. But I have to say that I very much enjoy the author's style of writing. I thought the writing evocative in parts. Another plus was the setting, I enjoy a Scottish story.So it will by no means be the last book by this author that I'll read."
3,Good shadowy mystery set in Scotland,"I was very excited to read this book after just discovering Susanna Kearsley via The Rose Garden. This is a very poetic book with colorful characters that I really liked. Especially The Sentinel. The book really gives you that feeling of Scotland and small village living. I tend to love books like this that can transform you to another place and time. Having said that, I found the book to be a bit slow to heat up and I think the author could have edited material in the beginning of the book to make it more succinct and really build toward the moments of excitement. Predictability sort of turns me off and there were some obvious snakes in the grass that you really could see coming as well as some of the mannerisms of the characters which is why I rated it a 3 instead of the 5 that it could have been. At the end of the day this is an enjoyable read if you enjoy a shadowy mystery set in Scotland as I do."
3,not her best,"This was an o.k. story. Definitly not one of her best. Mostly a love story, not much of a mystery. I don't mind a touch of romance, but I like mystery. Probably a winner for romance lovers."
1,Shadow Horses,No real story !Very Disappointing! I wouldn't recommend it too any one.NO DEPTH TO THE STORY OR THE CHARACTERS.
2,Sounded better than it turned out to be,"This book sounded great. However . . . lame story, completely unrealistic portrayal of archeological excavations. Did not live up to expectations."
5,Fun author,"As usual, I find Ms. Kearsley's books to be well-written, well-researched, and just plain fun to read. She has many books with the same basic theme but manages to include enough plot twists and different settings to keep things fresh. Fun light read."
4,Unexpectedly Good Read!,"Making the most I could of a Christmas Gift Card, I selected books by authors not previously read. Didn't know what to expect from The Shadowy Horses but I was hooked from the first few pages. Her vivid descriptions of the countryside, harbor town, and people drew me in and made me feel like I was right there in Scotland. Historical/Genealogical stories with a little mystery thrown in are my favorites, and I will definitely look for Ms. Kearsley's other works."
3,Nice read but not one of her best.,I felt that the story didn't really resolve itself as well as some of her other books. It was still a good read and worth the time.
2,"Too much shadow, not enough substance","I usually like Susanna Kearsley's books. This was the weakest as far as story and characters . They were one-dimensional and the although the story still had mythical characters from the past, they had no depth."
2,Least favorite,"This the third book by Kearsley that I have read. I have read some good reviews about Shadowy Horses but for me it was a disappointment. The ghost wasn't scary enough or do enough ghostly things to keep me interested. The love story moved too slowly and the villain was not a surprise, at least to me."
4,Good read,"The book ended a little abruptly. I would have liked more supporting the villain reveal, and a few more chapters with more detail at the end. Still, I love the way Susanna Kearsley writes, and overall this was a good read!"
3,Sweet but uneventful,"The idea, the setting and the set up were great. It just never really did much, and it could have been much more."
5,Barbara Michaels' fans need to discover this author!,"I'm not sure if I should thank Ms. Kearsley or be mad at her. I stayed up two nights in a row because I couldn't put her book down. The story was wonderful, and the characters were realistic. I have been looking for an alternative to Barbara Michaels' books, and I think Ms. Kearsley is it. My only suggestion to her would be-- write faster!"
3,Decent read,"There are not very many suspenseful moments in this book but it is an interesting read about archaelogy mixed in with ghosts. It felt like it was building up to something but I found the climax rather anti-climatic.That said, I still enjoyed and was glad I read it."
2,I'm very disappointed....,"First of all I love this author and have read all of her books. I was really excited to read this book as the plot sounded so interesting. Unfortunatley I feel very let down as the story just drags on and on. It just does not take off until will past the middle of the book. I would skip this one and if you haven't already read her other books, start with the Winter Sea."
2,Not up to par,"I was looking forward to reading this book after its Kindle release but it's just not of the same quality as Susanna Kearsley's other books. I still read the whole book, of course, but compared to Winter Sea or the Rose Garden, both of which I really loved and recommend to people all the time, it just wasn't the same. I didn't find Verity's character all that interesting and her constant jumping at noises and cold spots got old pretty quick. Meanwhile the plot lacks the same time and character connections that I'm used to in Kearsley's books. Granted the Ninth Legion is interesting/mysterious, but there wasn't much depth to the historical side of the story. Overall, I didn't develop much of a stake in the current day characters or in the historical ones.I will continue to recommend the author's other books, but this one is best left on the shelf."
3,Not one of Susanna Kearsley's Best Books,"I have read many of Susanna Kearsley's books and was looking forward to this one. I felt that it took a while to really pull me into the story. Susanna is a master at describing place; and I appreciate that in The Shadowy Horses, as well. I basically like her books that take the reader back and forth between different time periods, in which the heroine is living a life in each period that connects to her life in present time. This book did not do that. I also think that there is an over use of slanted and slanting, which drives me crazy because it seems like lazy writing. Despite my misgivings about The Shadowy Horses, I still appreciate the mood that Susanna is able to create in her stories. And, I am still looking forward to her next book. I just hope that Ms. Kearsley will consider another period novel, like Winter Sea or Mariana. KF"
3,"Easy, pleasant read","Susanna Kearsley's Shadowy Horses was a delightful change of pace from her previous novels. I found this novel to be a much easier read. It was a departure from the stories that, while enjoyable, were almost too contrived or too forced in premise. Shadowy Horses is a straightforward read that doesn't try too hard to be anything- it is simply an enjoyable place to visit when one wants to unwind with a good book."
2,History Mixed with Fiction,"History within a romance novel is always intriguing. I checked some facts which were accurate. The story captured my imagination. However, I felt the story was more a history with archeology than it was a romance. It dragged in many parts. There were not enough answers about the ghost. I feel the multiple love stories in the book could have been expanded. I also agree with other reviews that the end was anti-climatic. No, I would not recommend this book to anyone that was not an archeologist major."
3,For Younger Readers,"This book was innofensive, and could be recommended for younger readers. I chose this book on the strength of a previous one I read."
3,Disappointed,"After reading the Rose Garden and really enjoying the novel, I thought I'd read The Shadowy Horses. I was very disappointed. The book had potential, but fell flat. The characters were one dimensional and there was no depth to any of them. I felt they could have been developed much more, which would have made the reader identify with them more. Verity and Davy were likeable and there was some chemistry. It was not that I didn't like the different characters, they just didn't move me. I liked the Sentinel best, and he was a ghost. I had to reread lines at times thinking I've missed something. I had a lot of unanswered questions. I was bored throughout the story and as for romance, there was a touch. The book seemed to have jumped for me. They story didn't really flow. The ending seemed rushed and unfinished. Was hoping for much more."
1,I didn't even finish the book!,"This book was boring from the very beginning. I have read several books that did not start out very interesting but as I kept reading they got better. I wanted to give this book a chance so I kept going, finally about three fourths of the way through the book I gave up. Nothing about this book held my interest. The characters were all boring and the subject, unless you like archeology, were extremely boring. I would not recommend this book to anyone. It is the first time I have not finished a book."
2,Decent but not much there.,"I enjoyed the read but was looking forward to more info about the archeology and historical parts of the book. I was disappointed by that. Other than that, the characterizations were fairly good but still quite sterotypical and somewhat flat. The story line was very predictable. Better than many but not a great book."
3,Not her best!,"Sorry Groupies. I am a Kearsley fan of the highest order. Racing through her books late at night, leaving the light on while my hubby snores, well I'm just one of those. This book missed the mark. Perhaps she wanted to expand her horizons, try a new historical period, but it just didn't work. Returning to one of her other books for a reread will be my next step."
5,So glad this book became available as an ebook,"This was a wonderful read! I read it in 2 days. I love the unique characters Susanna Kearsley weaves together in her stories. I am always prompted to go look at maps and read up on the history that is woven into her books. This book has a little bit of all my favorite genres- suspense, historical fiction, and romance all intertwined. I appreciate that the romance is never graphic. I can't wait for Susanna Kearsley's next book to come out!"
1,Not loanable from Kindle,I loved this book. I hate that this book is not loanable to another Kindle owner. I was very disappointed
1,a forced read,I kept reading thinking it had to get better and it didn't. I finally gave up. Pass on this one.
3,"Nice idea, but the story felt a bit rushed","I really enjoy Susanna Kearsley's books. They are beautiful stories and well written. Shadowy Horses however is my least favourite. The concept for the story is great, but it felt like she was rushing to get the story finished and didn't set the mystery drama storyline well, so that when you reach the climax of the story, it feels forced."
3,Kept my Interest,"Having read all of Diana Gabaldon books - I guess I was expecting more, However this was a quick read and it did keep my interest."
2,disappointed,"I have ready, Winter Sea, Every Secret Thing, Mariana and Rose Garden. Shadowy horses simply did not have the storyline of the others."
3,Not quite.,"I did not enjoy this as much as some of her others, Winter Sea for one. Overall the story seemed to drag in places and the characters not as well drawn as I've come to expect from this author. Do not misunderstand, I did like it, just not as much. It is more of what I would call a 'typical' romance and less an historical fiction. While there were layers of historical reference and that 'ghosty' influence that is her trademark, they were much less in evidence than previous books. Meh....a decent read but not what I was hoping for."
4,Good Book,"I love Susanna Kearsley books. This one was not my favorite by her, but still a great book...looking forward to Firebird."
4,Liked it,"Chose this as I liked others by this same author. It was a good read for the price, would read others like it."
2,Nugae (Latin: trifles),"When Latin poets call their works 'nugae', it's self-deprecating. Their works are anything but trifles. This work, however, was all nugae. For a book about the search for the lost legion, I don't feel like I learned anything about the Roman military, or archaeology, or Latin for that matter. The plot was subsumed by the mediocre love story. The ending felt rushed, and the whole was unsatisfying. There was little character development, and the shadowy horses of the title were under used. Fluff."
4,In the vein of Mary Stewart and Barbara Michaels,I quite enjoyed this one. Not as much as Mariana but still worth readingThe heroine was likeable and not the cliched ravishing beautyThe mystery wasn't the focus of the story as much as I'd have liked but it was okayBarbara Michaels still rules!
1,Lousy game,"Graphics are the lowest quality you can imagine, and the game is so boring it was actually a relief to get killed. I am a hardcore Star Wars fan and I really hate this game."
1,This game sucks!!!,"Even with for 15 bucks this game isn't worth buying! After five minutes, I understood that I won't play that game anymore. The graphics are very basic and simple but the animation... aaaaarrrrrgggghhhh! How a game can be so choppy even with one caracter on screen??? The game engine is crappy... I won't even talk about the gameplay... so much slowdown don't make the fighting easier...swingning that crappy little force saber is more than difficult... good luck killing enemies..."
5,cheep out on bujet lucas did,"Yoda is like hot.The game is crap, but yoda is a hotty. I meen yoda is like so hot.WARRNING don't buy this game. Yoda is like so hot."
2,tofutofutofutofu,"basically youre this yoda guy and you like to tell stories to this wierd person named luke""skywalker"". ummm, i totally did not not get the plot to this game.something about respecting the ""force"" what is that anyway?it would be a cool movie if they made this game into a movie or tv series though. i'd like to see ""yoda"" and ""luke skywalker"" on a bigger screen.i thought the ""force"" idea was kinda stupid and the game could've done without it.so, if you wantok gameplay and a weird but interesting and original plot,try this game"
2,my eyes! my eyes!!!!,"when i played this at my friends house, i thought ""hey, the movies are good, the game sounds pretty fun!"" but then i turned it on... ""wait a minute! kyle, i move so slow and i cant...control...myself...what the heck is that? my character is...a.....blob! must...turn...it off....so i did, and i told my friend never ever bring it over again. a word of caution: if u don't want a handful of frustration, confusion, and difficulty, DONT GET THIS GAME!!"
4,Simple Pleasures,"I thought this was an ok game. The graphics are not the best but it is similair to Zelda. You walk around solving little puzzles and in the end solve the final puzzle. The game is not difficult but interesting if you like to be able to solve the puzzles with not much effort. There are thirteen levels and three different worlds (desert, snow and forest). You can beat one level in about 2 hours. You can also find a map to guide you in your quest."
1,Avoid at all costs,"Yoda Stories for the GameBoy Color is one of many Star Wars games that is just a wonder. As in, it's a wonder how this game ever passed quality control. In Yoda Stories, you go through levels of choppy graphics, excruciatingly dull gameplay, terrible controls, and just plain poor game design while battling Stormtroopers, sandpeople, etc. The game's battle system is so poorly designed that it truly is a wonder how this game ever got released, and even if your the most hardcore Star Wars fan on the block be warned: avoid Yoda Stories like the plague, this is undoubtadly the worst game with the Star Wars license attached to it to ever be released, and this is possibly the worst game for the GameBoy Color to date."
2,Yoda Blurries,"Yoda Stories is one of the worst Game Boy Color titles I have played to date. This game is almost a step back from its modern counterparts. It's simplistic, colorless backgrounds and characters during gameplay belong on the Gameboy's original yellow screen. Another shortcoming of this title is the gameplay control. The player's character, Luke Skywalker is made to walk extremely sloppy. Many gameplayers will find it quite difficult to maneuver Luke into a doorway or around a hazard. The screen appears to ""jump"" every time Luke moves in any direction, which can get quite frustrating when trying to concentrate during an important battle. The only thing that makes this game even tolerable is the story-line behind the gameplay. Hardcore Star Wars fans will enjoy playing an integral part in Luke Skywalker's training. However, gamers interested only in something fun to pass the time should buy something else-like Zelda DX or Spy Vs Spy-both are excellent little amusements."
3,Bozo doesn't hold air well,"Fun toy, but it immediately lost air before even being used. A patch kit is included but I cannot find the leak."
4,fine toy,"Smaller than I expected but the upgrade is better in that you don't have to add water to the bottom like the old ones and possibly misplace the cap. It's all one piece now and heavier on the bottom so made better, but on the small side."
2,"Fun, but not very durable","My grandson (age 3) enjoyed this toy, but it sprung a leak within a few days of him and his preschool friends hitting it with their fists. Maybe the manufacturer should provide a repair kit."
2,It's an OK toy,"The sand in the bottom of this bopper doesn't flow back to it's original place which makes the bopper not to stand straight up. If you punch it hard, it just stays down."
1,BOZO is no good,The Bozo I received does not stay inflated for more than 24 hours even without use! That's poor!
1,Hopes deflated,"My daughter loves it. However, there was a small pinhole along the side seam. This appears to be a manufacturing defect instead of a tear. The built in patch does not work because the hole is on a bumpy, raised seam, instead of a smooth panel - which means a complete seal cannot be made."
4,As described.,"There shouldn't be much question as to what this is, or what it's supposed to do. Nose squeaks, and it gets back up when you knock it down. It was shipped quickly and arrived safely, although from a different seller than currently listed. It may be losing a very small amount of air over the course of a few days, but I think that is to be expected. Product does come with a small patch kit also for any leaks. No surprises here, I think it's worth the $20 or so total. It's been a great addition to our office.P.S.I have to rate it on Educational Value?"
4,Fun for everyone!,"I'll be honest: I did not intend to use this product the way it was meant to be used. As a college student currently in Psychology, I purchased this product as a means to re-enact Albert Bandura's famous Bobo doll and aggression experiment. The product is a lot of fun and I use it to scare people who suffer from a phobia of clowns. The seller was very kind and helpful, as was the manufacturer. The product itself is not incredibly durable but as long as you aren't planning to really kick it around, it should be fine.Overall, not a purchase I regret!"
2,Fun for a day,"This was a cute product, but only lasted a day. Perhaps my preschool boys' punches were just too much for this bag. A patch was included, but it seems that air is leaking from the seams. Oh well."
1,Rocket Bozo,Product leaked from day 1. Was bought as Christmas present for grandchildren so was not opened right away. Vendor would not allow return even though defective. Would not recommend to anyone.
5,Great Fun - but not the best option for a true Punching Bag.,"I was worried this would not hold up based on other reviews, but my three year old attacks this, lays on it, sits on it and bounces...and it is holding up great. The sand in the base will pool to one side and he won't bounce all the way back up sometimes - so maybe not the best option for a ""punching bag"" but if you give him a shake he stands back up and is still lots of fun. My one year old loves it too."
3,Quick but damaged,"The product came quickly in the mail. However, it had a hole in the bottom and had to be repaired by the buyer before it could be used.--Vee"
1,Fun but very poor quality,"I concur with other posts - this is not a durable toy. My 4 year old punched its nose out in 3 hours. After super gluing it back together, it has sprung a leak every time it gets played with. Great for a day but that is it."
1,Never held air,"Our Bozo never held air enough to be punched for long. He arrived with a leak somewhere around the ear. We'd return him, but getting him back in the box and paying for shipping would offset the returned money. I thought that some of these ""didn't last a day"" reviews were because the kids were rough, but I suspect they didn't realized they had a leak from the start. He looked good and my kids were desperate to have him work, so it was very disappointing."
1,CHEAP,"Bought this for my grandson lasted one day. Very cheap, couldn't be fixed. What a waste of money. Would not recommend this due to the poor quality"
2,Bozo is a no no.,"Disappointed in this product. The squeaker in Bozo's nose didn't work and Bozo did not ""pop back up"" after being hit. Bought this for a bachelorette party with a boxing theme so only used it one night. Also, I didn't realize how heavy this product was before I shipped it internationally! It comes with sand for the bottom of Bozo which was good because he stood upright on his own."
5,Love It!,"I bought this for my 2 year old and when he opened it, the 4 year olds took it away and played with it! They loved this more than any of the other toys he got. I just thought for sure that they were rough housing so much that it would pop but it didn't and has stayed up and going for two weeks now. My two year old is the size of a four year old and jumps up and down on it everyday. I am shocked at how well it has held up, especially with the mixed reviews that I read before settling for this one. Also, I thought when I bought it, that I would have to put water or sand in the bottom of it but it has a weight in it already! I will be buying more of these for Christmas and birthday gifts!"
3,Solid fun doesnt work all that well,"This came exactly how i wanted it to come and looked exactly how it was depicted, the only problem was if you dont inflate it to the point of popping it doesnt work that well. When you punch this bozo doll it falls down and fails to come up most of the time. it wither needs a lot more air or a lot more sand."
1,less than happy,"It arrived with a hole in it before we could even use it. It can't hold air now. We tried patching it with the patch kit included with it, but the leak is on a seam and so it is worthless. Sad present for my daughter since she can't use it."
3,Not like it used to be!,"I should have followed the reviewers advice that I read on this product. I figured I'd give the item the benefit of the doubt that maybe the toy was abused a little more than the reviews stated. BUT...after being a ""sucker"" and going ahead and purchasing it, my 2 year old Grandson, who weighs about 27 pounds was having so much fun with Bozo and I was enjoying watching him. After about 5 minutes, he was sitting on Bozo and I could hear the hissing plain as day. YEP...just as the reviews stated... a leak in the seam (which of course can not be repaired with the patch that they so graciously include) The leak was under Bozo's hair (the part of Bozo that my grandson didn't even touch, because he's too short to reach it I am so disappointed. How much money did this company save to make this product so cheap, that it doesn't even last through a one time 5 minute round with a 2 year old!"
4,Stress relief with a little nostalgia,"I bought this item as a stress relief tool at my job, and it works quite well. It's also a great conversation starter. It's difficult to walk into an office with a Bozo punching bag and not make mention of it. I used to have one as a kid, so sometimes it just serves as a nice reminder of a much simpler time."
2,Deflated expectations,"Alas, this bop bag could not stay inflated for more than a couple of minutes. Caused no end of moaning from my five year old boy! I'm sure some of these bop bags work fine, but it sure made ME feel like the Bozo."
3,bozo troubles,My grandchildren love Bozo. I ordered two and one of them is still being used. One of them must be blownup frequently the other one however got a hole in the seam and we attempted to fix it many times in several ways. It would not stay up long enough to play with it. I attempted to contact the people I ordered from and could not get this accomplished. So Bozo is gone. I might reorder if I had any indication that the next one would stay up. The one that stays up most of the time has four boys beating on it a time so I think the product is essentially good.
4,Great for little boys (and girls),"My four year old needed something to hit, besides his sister, so he got this for Christmas. We blew it up and he loved. it. Unfortunately, it was deflated the next morning. I emailed the company and they immediately sent another one, which has held up well. It is great for those kids that need to vent physical aggression."
2,Bozo,I feel like a bozo for having gotten this toy. It lasted about 2 days before springing a fatal leak. It should come with a disclaimer that punching it will shorten its useful lifespan.
3,Only lasted about 3 Weeks,"My expectations for this weren't too high, but it looks like others experienced the same problem: It got a hole somewhere incredibly hard to find making the patch useless. Wouldn't recommend one of these for long term use, but if you are looking for something short term, go for it. I was actually surprised by how tall it was, and responsive on the rebound."
2,Lasted One Day,"It's fun while it lasts. The problem is, it doesn't last. This thing came with air leaks and it only got worse."
4,Bozo the Clown Bop Bag,Bought this for my 18 month old grandson and he loved it. Also my 4 year old granddaughter loved it. Hope it holds up.
1,What a fun five minutes.,"My 4 year old daughter received this as a birthday present. After reading the numerous reviews online I was skeptical of its durability, for ALL the right reasons. It takes about 10 minutes of good lung time to blow up, smells of vinyl terribly and when I set it down on the carpet my daughter bopped it about 10 times and I noticed he was saggy already, upon inspection he had a hole the size of an pencil directly on the seam at the bottom by his right foot. There was no patch kit included so I attempted to glue some heavy duty clear tape to no avail. Total piece of worthless vinyl toy...save your money and buy something else.In conclusion, To much money for 3 minutes of fun."
2,Lasted One Day!,"My girls, 5 and 8 loved this and were very excited using it. Unfortunately it only lasted Christmas day. The next day it was deflating. I found a leak in the seam and patched it, but it was not the only one. It has now been given a funeral and was buried under pillows. I was a bit disappointed since I at least wanted it to be fun for awhile. I would suggest if your children are 5 or over do not buy this. Find a more durable product."
3,Bozo Bop Bag,The Bozo Bop toy keeps my grandson occupied for a while. The only problem is to make sure the bag is filled with enough air or the Bozo will not bounce back up. I can remember this toy from the 1950's.
3,"Fun, but not durable","Bought Bozo for my grandsons because it was the only bop bag I could find filled with sand instead of water. First time I tried to inflate it, I discovered a big gap where the ""hair"" attaches to the head. I got some vinyl cement to patch it and it did hold for a while. My grandsons had a great time with Bozo for about 2 weeks, now it's flat again, so once again we'll try to find the hole and patch it. This would be a great toy if the quality was better. It works so much better than the water filled bop bags. The sand-filled bottom helps it bounce right back when the kids bop it. I would recommend this toy for the fun but the quality of the product is very disappointing."
3,Very cool looking,"We bought one for our 5 year old for Christmas. He absolutely loved it...perfect size for that age...very bright and colorful. Unfortunately Bozo soon lost his air....not sure but it could have come from my husband punching him(lasted about 5 days). I have ordered another one, as it really is better quality than dept. store ones. Will resubmit if this one loses air as quickly. Like I said, I can't say for sure if it lost air due to an adult rough housing it or it just could be defective."
1,Not very durable,The kids had fun with this product while it lasted. Unfortunately it only lasted a couple days before springing a leak inside the fold around the ear. The leak was in a bad spot and we could not repair it. Boo Hoo.
2,Bozo lasted 6 months and then lost his air.,Bozo was a work place joke he got punched around in my dept for about 2 weeks and then just sat in the corner. When he was about 6 months old he started losing his air and now bozo is flat on the floor.
3,Displeased with service,"Product was fine, but somehow our order was duplicated. I tried to head this off by e-mail to no avail. After receiving product, I left phone mail message for the shipper re: returning but received no response. This has soured any desire I might have to deal with Amazon or the product shipper again."
3,Memories,I remember these types of products as bouncing up each time it was knocked to the floor. You knock this one over and itjust lies there until manually pulled upright. I'm a little disappointed.
1,Popped on the first day,I got this for my 9 year old and she managed to pop it on the first day - to many seams for a hole to appear.
2,Leaking right away,"Thought this would be cute for my kids...but it started leaking air right away. We pump it up but then a few hours later it's falling over. Kids really like it, but it doesn't seem that durable!"
1,Flat in a day,"We got this for my 5 year old son's birthday. As you would expect, he and his little brother had a blast punching and jumping on the thing. It was so much fun, for 1 day. We woke up the next morning to find it deflated, a hole in it already. Taped it up, another hole. Of course boys are going to tackle and jump on it, it's just not made to take a beating. Thankfully we were able to return it without an argument."
2,Yep - deflates!,"LIke other posts - this toy starts to leak/deflate after a few kicks and punches. :( Fun to look at, not so great for kids kicking and getting their energy out."
5,Old fashioned stress relief,"I purchased this as a gift for a co-worker. It provides stress relief as a punching bag, it make you smile when you look at it, and it brings back fond childhood memories. It's inexpensive enough to replace if it gets torn."
3,bozo bop bag,It came in good shape and in time for christmas. The stopper that keeps the air in would not stay in and the bag loses it's air.I guess you could use tape to hold it in. I wouldn't recommend this toy.
3,Teen Titans T-Robo,Wish it was as sturdy as the Power Rangers megazord. Feel the mfg was trying their last ditch effort of cashing in on Teen Titans using the Power Rangers momentum.
3,Kind of boring,"It is kind of boring because alls it is is just a big action figure. I use the titan character figures all the time,but this is boring."
5,Pressure washer quick connect tips,The pressure washer tips that I purchased with amazon was just what I needed to finish the job I was doing. Great Product!!! Would recommend Amazon to any one. Thank you very Much.
3,Not her best,"This is a more obscure release from Dolly Parton. Not her best, but there's some great gems here. On this 1995 release, she gives some of her older songs a new flair and style. Songs that were reworked include ""The Seeker"", ""Jolene"" and the classic ""I Will Always Love You"". Her reworking of ""I Will Always Love You"" is especially good, since this time it is remade as a duet with Vince Gill. The song was a mild hit with country radio, and one of her last to crack the top 20. The rest of the album is a mixed bag. ""Crippled Bird"" is an incredibly poetic but sad ballad. ""Change"" is a nice ballad that is very honest about wanting a change in a relationship. ""Teach Me To Trust"", the album closer, is another nice song. The rest of the songs are ok, but nothing too special really. Not an essential release from Parton by any means but the avid fan will want it."
4,Just that I need,"Was that I was looking for, I could fix my son drumset, is hard and durable, I'm happy with this purchase"
3,DO NOT make this your 1st live Phish album,"Trey is the weak link on the show. The best part about this concert is that it doesn't make me sad they broke up. Trey's improv as always is top notch. However, the songs he has been playing for years are filled with mistakes.If you are trying to get into Phish you're late to the party. If you must, check out ""A Live One"", ""Live Phish Vol. 15"", or ""New Years 1995"". Anything but ""Live in Brooklyn"".... What happened Trey?"
3,Shipped to a friend - A new Phish fan,"Great cross section of a great band - A bit ""weird"" at times but must of been an epic gig"
2,A mixed bag--the wrong way,"Live in Brooklyn has all of the jamming and spontaneity of Live04 Drum Logos, and all of the passion of Hampton Comes Alive. For phans, that's not a ringing endorsement....There are some bright spots (an awesome, rollicking Suzy Greenberg!), some are downright lame (Dinner and a Movie is a waste of a song, and that's the worst Divided Sky I've ever heard), but most are just...average. Phish's average is better than most bands really good, but we have higher standards."
4,"""Dead Man On Campus"" is a good flick","All around, I liked this movie. It did take a weird, kind of ""suicide is funny"" view, and it is NOT. If the Mtv guys thought the approach on suicide over, It'd be 5 stars"
5,Awesome!,"I love this movie before i bought it and i couldn't find it in any stores, so i looked on [...] and i found it very easily. this movie is great and it came even faster in the mail than what they predicted. it was quite a surprise when i got it early, but it was also very nice."
4,The funniest movie!,"I watched both Dead Man on Campus & The Curve (starring Keri Russell and Matt Lillard), and although the concepts were the same, Dead Man was just indescribably better. The way Mark-Paul Gosselar and Tom Everett Scott interacted was hilarious and the way the story was layed out was just great. If it weren't for that Cliff guy, who got annoying at times, the rating would have been higher though. Never-the-less, I'm definately going out and buying the movie on video as soon as it comes out."
3,I love college,"not a three star movie but a 2 in a half star movie. this one pits Tom Evertt Scott(American Werewolf In Paris) as Josh in a college and he meets his new roomate Cooper played by Mark Paul Gosselaar(Saved By The Bell, NYPD Blue). they learn that if any of your roomates dies then they get straight A's and they try to move in a few roomates so they can push them over the edge and kill them but things go a little wonky. also in the mix is Lochlyn Munro(Dracula 2000), Poppy Montgomery(tv's Without A Trace) and Alyson Hannigan(Willow on Buffy The Vampire Slayer). some good moments include the scene where they meet Munro and he starts humping things, also the sperm song sung by Corey Page, is hilarious."
5,The Funniest Movie I Ever Saw!,"This movie was so funny! Mark was hot with black hair which added to my enjoyment. This movie shows what can happen when guys in college are let to roam free and have a good time. The best part was when the bong got broken and they were sitting there crying about it! I ""high""ly recommend it!"
5,This Was a sweet movie!,"This movie was awsome! Whoever's reading this has to buy this movie! It is hilarious, and Lochlyn Monroe gives one of the funniest performances of the decade as the insane roomate! If you haven't seen this movie, see it, and you'll laugh right out of your couch/chair. The funniest part of the movie is when the guy takes his beer bottle, lights it with a lighter, and smokes it!"
4,At First it Appears to Be Stupid But...,"It actually is a smartly written biting satire on American college life. Good ol' Zack from TVs ""Saved By the Bell"" is going to fail all his classes unless his roomate commits suicide. Sounds silly, but the college has a rule about such things. One problem. Where to find such a roomate who wants to kill himself? Lots of sophomoric laughs (ala ""American Pie"") and a great deal of dark comedy twist around each other in this college tale. Think of it as ""Saved By the Bell: The College Years"" if it were written by Trey Parker and Matt Stone and was on Fox. Great comedy that should not be missed."
3,Above average college comedy,"This movie was entertaining enough. Basically two college roomates are failing their classes and they find out that if thier third roomate commits suicide then they will get A's (according to the school rule book). The acting was great especially from the two main characters. Nothing new in the direction, could have been more stylish but it was sufficent for this kind of movie. I would recommend this movie to people who enjoyed American Pie and Road Trip although I didn't think this movie was as well made. For an even better movie in this genre check out Election which is another mtv movie."
3,"Name is Cliff, brother of Joe.....","I recently bought this dvd after years of wishing that I had it. I remember it being better, but it is still pretty good. The ""roomates"" are funnier than the main guys (Tom and Mark). I gave it three stars because it cost more than a lot of my other dvds and could have been better. All-in-all it is a funny dark comedy worth watching."
2,Wow,"I love this movie, but who in their right mind would pay 50 bucks for it? Not me, that's for sure."
5,Best College Movie Ever!,"Dead Man on Campus is honestly one of the best movies i have ever seen! The characters are all hilarious espcially Cliff, Zeke, and Cooper. It's a definatly movie of a teenage movie, because of the plot, but some adults might enjoy it. The movie keeps you laughing all the way through, with one hilarious joke after another."
5,I liked This..........,"I liked, this movie a great college, film I laughed through this movie you'll like, this it's worth the money enjoy..."
4,Great! Just a little too extreme...,"Again, one of these movies which would reach a wider category of people if it wasn't that extreme. Gosselaar just played very great, he was too extreme. Cliff O'Maley (character) was a lot too extreme. I scratched half-a-star for that.The other half-star : I believe Linda Cardellini was great, but she could have been there like, a minute or two more.If you're Mr. Z, gimme a call. Maybe we could share the room..."
5,Totally worth it,"this movie is hysterical. no matter your age, you'll appreciate the humor and comical desperation these to characters go through. Its a very funny movie, and Mark Paul Gosselaar and Tom Everett Scott make a great duo; both have amazing comedic timing and delivery. I was pleasantly surprise by this movie."
1,What a biased book?! Misrepresentation of Muslims.,"Ms. Manji is just using Islam to make money. Her book is full of inaccuracies. Her obsession with a ""righteous"" Israel is also misplaced. No matter how liberal Islam becomes, it can never tolerate a Lesbian or Gay lifestyle. So my suggestion to Ms. Manji would be to convert to say, Judaism, and let us be. If you have so many problems with Islam, why do you follow it?Muslim women have, can and will do great things; nudity is not eqvalent to liberation. After all, Benazir Bhutto, a woman, has ruled Pakistan twice. The United States hasn't been ruled by a woman.So, open your mind to the real Islam, not the biased version shown on FOX news and other TV channels and media."
1,"Yeah, something here DEFINITELY NEEDS A REFORM","and this thing is this woman! Comparing the prophet, peace be upon him, to Osama Bin Laden...Wow! The most ridiculous, the most offensive, the most close-minded thing that ever lived. Trying to make money with such NASTY, grossly false assertions, no scholalry work whatsoevr, everyhting as RADICAL and as selective as ever. She should compare Osama bin Laden with HERSELF! If you're a blinded, racist, hateful beast, then this is just a treat for you. If you're not any of the above, then stay away!!"
1,There are much better books about Islam,"Please don't think (as I thought) that this book was written for Muslims seeking justice, equality, etc. In reality, this book is not helpful to Muslims. Rather, this book is for those who are seeking to attack the faith.For those interested, the following books about Islam are better alternatives to this book:Justice/Law:""Authoritative and Authoritarian in Islamic Discourses"" and ""Conference of the Book"" by Khaled Abou El FadlProgressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism by Omid Safi (editor)Qur'an Liberation and Pluralism by Farid EsackWomen:Qur'an and Woman: Rereading the Sacred Text from a Woman's Perspective by Amina Wadud""Believing Women"" in Islam: Unreading Patriarchal Interpretations of the Qur'an by Asma BarlasIslamic faith and history:Islam: Religion, History, and Civilization by Seyyed Hossein Nasr"
4,A good thesis in need of a revision,"Ms. Manji's thoughts are very much needed in this time when violence is so easily justified as being a spiritual response by the ignorant and misguided. Frankly speaking, Islam today is in bad shape and needs critical thought and leadership instead of the cult of personality that predominates much of it in the Middle East. Regarding such, Ms. Manji's book is a useful disscussion of such though there is some parts that require further editing since they are not accurate and do her work harm. If a *revised* second edition is printed, that would be an even better idea than what is now available, though it is still worth reading."
4,Thought provoking,"This book challeged how I view Isalm and the sterotypes I wasnt even aware that I suffered from . Please get a copy of this book . It doesnt have all the answers , in fact it could be argued that it has none . Rather it is an inspiration that peolpe can change things just by the power of an idea and we should not be shackeled by instituations ; both religious and cultural . My only critisism is that the first couple of chapters are a little self indulgent , but after that the conversational style and the topics and views made this an easy reading.I will use this book and the bibliography to further my understanding of an important issue of our time"
5,Truth Should Always Be Questioned,"As I wrote in my novel,Standup Comedian: The Secret and Beyond, ""A closed society is to ideas as incest is to a family; it produces idiots."" The same can be said of one political system and of one religion. When Catholicism had Christianity locked up it spawned the Inquisition and other atrocities.Ms Manji's book explains why all ""Truths"" should be questioned. John Stewart Mill wrote that truth attacked is made stronger, and if it is not truth it will be proven flase. Ms Manji asks the questions that need to be answered.Kenneth Ray Taylor author ofBeyond the Shadow of Death: Book One of the Adam Eden Series"
3,Gutsy,"I really liked this book. It might be better than a 3 star. It is written by a woman who immigrated to the west and has tried to maintain her Muslim faith. I saw her interviewed on Charlie Rose Show and thought she was excellent. She is pretty hot but gay (unfortunately for the guys out there), which is neither here nor there, except in in a fundamentalist Muslim country she might be stoned for being gay. I liked the book and thought it was a brave confrontation on the problems with Islam. Glad she wrote it. It is really necessary. I wish more people had her guts. Would recommend it."
4,A KICK-START,"Irshad Manji certainly packs a wallop, and certainly many ""desert Muslims"" need one, because they interpret the Qu'ran to suit their own patriarchal ways. See my review of Amina Wadud's book, ""Qur'an and Women"" for a deeper but more specific study of perhaps the most urgent need in Islam: the activation of the feminine half of the people of Islam."
2,"I forgive you, Ms. Manji... :/","As much as it stings my heart to do this, I forgive you for writing this book. It might do more damage than you ever thought could be possible. Maybe that was your intention?"
1,Unbelievable - LITERALLY!,"Are you kidding me ...this woman doesn't know THING ONE about Islam, and it's frightening she wrote a book and perpetrates herself as a Muslim who has knowledge of her religion.Islam doesn't need reformation. Perhaps some ""Muslims"" do but not Islam. Like Christianity doesn't need reform, but some ""Christian"" perspectives and action do."
1,People must be fair,Iam not a muslim but I belive the author had interpreted alot of things in islam according to her own mood....including the issue of the hur...Islam is a great religion...if some one wants to know about islam he must read books written by muslims..Why? because their are many people who hate islam because of the middle east conflict or maybe because of a personal problem and purposely through out false accusations aginst islam
1,JUST FOR THE CHEAP POPULARITY,"I HAVE READ MANY BOOKS OR ARTICLES LIKE MISS MANJI'S BOOK ""THE TROUBLE WITH ISLAM TODAY"" AND IN MOST OF THE LITERATURE OR ACTUALLY I SHOULD CALL IT GARBAGE PEOLE LIKE MISS MANJI ARE LOOKING FOR THE CHEAP POPULARITY. IT HAS BECOME A FASION FOR MOST OF THE IGNORANT PEOPLE TO WRITE ON SUCH TOPICS TO IGNITE THE FIRE. SHE IS UPSET WITH HER LIFE AND IS BLAMING ON HER RELIGION THAT SHE HARDLY PRACTICES. SHE REALLY NEEDS A GOOD PSYCHIARIST FOR HERSELF. I PERSONALLY RESPECT EVERY RELIGION IN THE WORLD AND NO ONE GIVES US ANY RIGHT TO CRITICISE ANY RELIGION AS WE ALL KNOW EVERY FAITH HAS SOME DEFICIENCIES IN IT. IF SOME ONE DOESNT LIKE IT SHE DOESNT HAVE TO STAY WITH THE FAITH BUT THEN PROBABLY SHE WONT GET THE SAME CHEAP POPULARITY AS SHE IS GETTING NOW AMONG OTHER IGNORANTS."
1,Total waste of time,"I believe this book comes with an extremely poor understanding of muslim history and a pathetic analysis of muslim values and culture. It seems to be an attempt to gain fame without providing some quality material. I have watched the author a few times on the TV also and all she has is self-praise and an unnecessary reaction to Islam. Overall, I believe this book is a waste of time."
4,Definitely worth reading,"I couldn't put it down. Manji writes engagingly and with energy about a topic that she has clearly thought long and hard about. I'm sure she'd be the first to admit she's no scholar, but there's no doubt she's spent time with the Koran, reading and genuinely trying to understand it. Her views are her own---and heartfelt.She believes that reforms within Islam are necessary, and some will therefore dismiss her as an ""Islam/Muslim basher."" But she points to many serious problems and has the courage to suggest some possible solutions. Why not read her book with an open mind and decide for yourself what her ideas are worth?"
3,"Good, but how objective is it?","It is obvious that reform is needed when Muslims kill each other daily. The core issues identified are well founded, but how likely is it that we will gain enough ground with reforms when the basic ideology is believe as I believe or be killed? Born Muslim, I can't see our way out of this except through close examination, including scientific questionning of basic beliefs and practices."
2,Riding on the Women in Islam wave....,"While Manji's call for reform is compelling, her delivery is alienating. If she was trying to reform her fellow Muslims I can't imagine she had many calling her back. The book was interesting, yes, and often funny, but other times simplistic and even insulting."
1,Salman Rushdie Wannabe,"Lame attempt to ride on the ""Islam Bashing"" bandwagon. I'd rather read same material in the New York Times by Nicolas Kristoff and Thomas Friedman, far better writers and analysts than this emotionally charged author, desperate to impress the western world."
1,Muslim Born Confused Gay Writing about Islam?,"It was a great disappointed to see an ""educated"" Muslim Woman criticize her faith in such a primitive level of writing and lack of Koranic knowledge. I feel sorry for all her childhood disturbances with a violent father and a submissive mother, but instead of blaming her identity crisis on Islam (just because she was born a Muslim) why does not she go to therapy instead? This book is a clear supporter of the Anti-Muslim campaign in the Western World, no wonder Manji loves to defend the powerful Jewish Community. What a disappointment! Manji has trouble with her faith, her ethnicity and her sexuality. People from all religions have the right to question them, but if she is so ignorantly perplexed about Islam, why does not she convert to something else? Islam is never forced on anybody, and by now she should know it. Also, how could anybody trust a Muslim who dares to speak so badly about her own family? That just shows her rotten spirit."
1,where all this anger is coming from,"I wanted to read this book, just to see what's up with this women. Come to find out that she has a problem with a religion that she does not understand, nor appreciate. She took the readers ona ride trying to expalin te problems with islam and she kept on and on telling stories that can not be verefied or substantiated. My point is that she is free to write about what ever she wants.I belive that everyone knows about the stories from saudia arabia, but to claim that Israel is a democrecey, while overlooking the fact that Israel impresion 3 million palastenians is kind strange. you wonder who published this book. this is a good book for people who are ignorants about Isalm, the middle east and the world in general. Do not waste your money."
2,An ignorant kid needs education,"About her book all I would say that she needs to educate herself about Islam and meet face to face with Islamic scholars and ask them all her question. To me the criteria of a scholar is the one who has a PHD in Islamic studies and written more then hundred books on various Islamic subjects. She will certainly get helped.She is angry and in search of truth. Before writing anything about Israeli and Palestinian conflict she would have lived at least 3 months in Palestine and interviewed the families of suicide bomber and ask them why they become so, what are their sufferings and why they feel proud to have one, and those Israeli families who lost their love ones and how they want to end this conflict.She should also ask herself a very simple question that ? WHY ISLAM IS THE FASTEST GROWING RELIGION BY CHOICE IN NORTH AMERICA?? And look for answers."
1,A wonderful book for bigots and islamophobes,"As a muslim living in the west, i find this book a complete disgrace. The author is completely ignorant of her faith, she asserts things about islam which exist only in her distorted mind and the mind of the ignorant bigots who agree with her. She makes false claims about the koran and islam which will certainly give comfort to the islamphobes and the fundamentalist evangelist christians, many of them have been lavishing her book here with 'stars'.If anyone is sincerely interested to read about a woman's perspective of islam from inside then my advice is to read any books by Fatima Mernissi, a well known woman Muslim scholar with real knowledge of the subject or read the book by Leila Ahmed's 'women and gender in islam'."
1,bad book,"I bought this book because I saw this lady on TV and I though what an interesting person. But once I started reading it, all I could feel was her anger. So it was not a pleasant reading for me, since all her anger was put in that book in a really bad bad way. In my humble oppinion, there are other ways to write and other ways in which she could have ENGANGE the reader in agreen with her. Instead, althouhg her life story is somewhat interesting, they way she writes is just awful."
4,The Trouble With Islam Today,"A very revealing text--open, honest, frank. I have lived in the Middle East, however, and found most Muslim people very kind, tolerant, and peaceful but often offended by what they perceive is the typical American culture which involves immorality, drugs, violence and anti-religious. That, unfortunately, is not the way it really is. The text, The Trouble With Islam Today, really has a lot of truth but probably doesn't reflect most of the typical Muslim culture or mores. We must be careful not to ascribe all radical and hate mongering to the average Muslim just as they must be cautious about perceiving American or Western culture and values which is commonly portrayed in TV, news media, or in films."
4,A Must Read about the real Muslim World,"Ms Manji seems to tell the world about the real Muslim world as she sees it. She sort of warns us about being too politically polite because there is some real dangers involved. She tries to explore fixing the situation, but I think it is more difficult than can be imagined."
4,It's ok,I bought this game and it was a lot different to Fifa 99.More teams and leagues have been added including classics.The players faces look a bit like cartoon figures.But the action replays will rock your world.The seasons are good too.Each time you finish one you can choose to carry on.If you say yes then teams get relegated and promoted and other teams qualify for European Cups.In a season they include the FA Cup aswell.You can also edit the tactics.You also have real injuries to cope with too and suspencions.
4,Poetry,"Works out just fine, used it for a class on British Literature and it was nice that I didn't have to carry a large book around."
3,"Excellent work, unfortunate compilation","I try not to be terribly picky when it co.es to free books, but much better versions are out there in the public domain. I am a student and a lack of table of contents makes the 100+ pages difficult to navigate. Also, this edition was prior to the edition with the important preface that defined the project aand much of Romantic poetry. However, these are great works for anyone looking for 19th century literature."
5,It's Ken..,"You've stumbled across this book by mere circumstance? Doubtful. I was given this book for my 24th(?) birthday by my now wife. I spent the next six months reading and taking notes on all of its content. If you're like me, and interested in the ""self"" and ""reality"" you will be floored by this book. It's not a definitive book but it leads you down the rabbit hole. Since, I've read his tome of a book Sex, Ecology, and Spirituality and many other smaller books. Ken has a way of connecting a plethora of philosophies. I appreciate his approach. I am a Christian, so I do not align with his initial end, but have learned so much about all things through him. Imagine, a way to look at all things at all levels. Friend, buy this book and be blown away. It will make you doubt, be fearful, and reassure you. God bless."
5,Handel - Giulio Cesare / Mijanovic Kozená von Otter Hellekant B. Mehta A. Ewing Bertin Les Musiciens du Louvre M,"Handel - Giulio Cesare / Mijanovic Kozená von Otter Hellekant B. Mehta A. Ewing Bertin Les Musiciens du Louvre Minkowski is a recording under the direction of Marc Minkowski who leads the Les Musiciens du Louvre who play on authentic instruments on this Deutsche Grammophon GmbH recording 2003. Being a recording by DG the sound is amazing and one verily feels as one is listening to it live. The booklet is close to 200 pages. It contains many nice photographs from the time of the recording. A very well-written essay by Donald Burrows entitled ""Handel's 'Giulio Cesare in Egito'"" and a short synopsis. The one gets short biographies of the performers. Ann Sophie Von Otter is amazing in the role of Sesto. Highly recommended. 5/5."
4,Cheesy but Good,"It's typical David E. Talbert. The singing is very good but the acting leaves some things to be desired. Overall, it is a good little play, though."
3,Unrealistic,"I give A Fool and His Money three stars. The play is a bit unrealistic, however I enjoyed the singing of thegrandmother and grandson. Eddie Griffin is hilarious, as well. It could've been a great play if it was more realistic."
4,very nice,I really enyjoyed the play. great messsage and story plot. got the dvd at walmart for 7 dollars and i feel its worth every dime
3,Not bad,"The size L seems to be more like XL, so i used only like two times and give it away to someone heavier.. The product it's excelent."
5,What Learning Curve?,"With most computer software their is a huge learning curve because we do not understand the principles behind the applications. Ron Black's has hand crafted the fundamentals and more of Project Management to ensure the applications can be implemented with ease.The Complete Idiots Guide to Project Management 2000 executes one of the first principals everyone should know about Project Management. Move slow in the beginning to ensure speed and forward progress in the execution phase. This is how this book is written.Not only have I read this book from cover to cover, but it also serves as a good reference for future projects. I can't wait for your next release.Michael Savoie"
2,Good terminology and photos,"Decent book if you are looking for terms and descriptions and sketch photos. Overall , I am not terribly impressed with this book."
5,A Treasure of a Tale,"Santa Mouse has traveled with our family for over 30 years. Through joy, triumph, tragedy, births and deaths every Christmas we would break it out. As life has grown and expanded us we have all continued to return each year, gather together and read our beloved Santa Mouse. It has been a missel of love, memories and treasured times that has woven through our lifes like a thread of gold. A wonderful addition to any special Christmas library. Why we just finished it for the 34th time!"
5,Classic Christmas Tale,"This is a classic Christmas tale that is no longer in the stores, but it available from resellers. So many of the books today are here and then gone, I look for books that have enduring values. It was fist published in 1966 and tells the story of a little mouse who thinks to give Santa a present -- a little piece of cheese that he kept all year. Santa then gives the mouse an outfit so that the mouse can help him on his rounds. It is in rhyme, and the way it is paginated (the pages go) it is sometimes hard to get the rhyme right, but I think is worth the effort to teach children that giving is as good as receiving - something modern children don't often know."
4,Santa Mouse book,"I realize that it was only listed as in ""good"" condition but all other books I've ordered were in much better shape. This one had several scrape marks on the edges. Thankfully, the family it went to was pleased with it, even though I pointed out the flaws.When I order this book I make a crocheted ""Santa Mouse"" to go with it so that helps."
1,Not the Original Hits-Rerecordings,"These are rerecordings. All done in 1995. You'll have to look on the lower back cover (in not very large print) to figure this out. This was given to me as a gift, so don't get burned with rerecordings. Stick to Curb's All Time Greatest Hits and avoid this unless you're a T. Graham Brown completist."
4,Queen,"A bit slow in spots, but excellent acting, sensitive presention of a controversial subject, respectful presentation of all historica people involved."
4,Mirren worthy of Oscar.,"Was skeptical of going to this movie, another account of the royals and all. Was absolutely convinced I was watching the Queen herself in Mirren's portrayal. Incorrectly titled as just 'The Queen', when in actuality this film is dealing with the Queen's and the Country's response to the death of Princess Diana. This is one moment in time. As far as the Queen's entire life, was expecting more history. Blair saves the day, and the staunchy people are flustered. Leaves you feeling a bit for the Queen, they missed the mark on Charles. Overall interesting."
3,Disappointed in the Queen,"I missed this film when it showed locally. I have waited and waited to view it. Finally got the idea of ordering it on line. Was pleased to find it at reazonable price on Amazon. Finally viewed it the other night. I was a bit disappointed in the film. Hadn't realized it was about the death of Diana and the poor light deservably cast upon the Queen because of her cold reaction to Diana's death. I like Helen Mirren very much, but didn't think her role in this film deserved the award it received. Sorry Helen! Mahala H., Miami, FL"
4,Great performance in an oddly-focussed movie,"First, I'd like to reiterate what everybody else has said - Helen Mirren's portrayal of Queen Elizabeth is superb. Her portrayal was very believable and sympathetic, as she showed a woman who, in the words of my dad, ""thought she was popular with the people, but found out that she wasn't nearly as popular as Diana, and that really shook her.""This movie is absorbing, thoughtful, revealing... and ironic. It's entitled ""The Queen,"" a title which would imply that it would cover the life of Elizabeth. In fact, this movie primarily covers a single week in her very long life as queen. And then, at the end of the movie, Tony Blair basically tells her that the week of Diana's death would just be a blip in people's memories - that people would remember Elizabeth for all of the things she'd done in her lifetime as queen, and not just for her reaction to Diana's death. But apparently that's not the case, if this movie is any indication."
2,Is it really that good?,"I hate to break it. But i don't get what's all the fuss about this movie. Yes Helen Mirren gives an amazing performance as Queen Elisabeth II but thats pretty much it. The movie itself is pretty boring. Best director? There really wasn't that much going on. Doesn't mean that the movie is based on true events means it HAS to be a good movie automatically. C'mon. Thank god this movie was short movie, cause if it had ran over 120min i'd probab walk out or fall asleep. All the acting were only 'reactions', The ending was satisfying with a little foreshadowing if anyone picked up on it. Overall. Helen Mirren walks home with the gold, but the movie would be a real stinker with out her."
2,"Honestly, VERY boring and overhyped","I had great expectations for this film but I was disappointed with it.I actually thought that the Tony Blair character was better acted than the Queen character acted by Helen Mirren. (BTW, I think Meryl Streep got robbed of another Oscar). The Queen's character is flat and one-dimensional and as the viewer, one cares nothing about her so-called internal struggles.The cinematography was nothing special, the score was practically nonexistent and definitely forgetable, and the MTV-like connecting of real television images and the actors was not a smooth and seamless presentation.And then there's the story itself....ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.I'd skip this movie."
1,Don't waste your time,"I do not recomend this movie. It is very slow and boring. If you want to see Helen Mirren's best work, rent ""Calandar Girls."" Don't waste your time with ""The Queen."""
1,DULL IMITATION,"Helen Mirren imitated Queen Elizabeth rather than BEING her. This was a dull, boring movie, which gave us very little insight into the character of this woman. I do not recommend this movie at all...I don't care what the Academy of Arts and Sciences says. Don't bother buying it."
5,Casting is faultless,"The actors really look the parts in this insider's fantasy about what it must be like to be queen. The film really focuses on the week Diana died, and what happened behind the scenes. It's speculation, but we do know the Royals didn't want to acknowledge the death until forced by public opinion. If this is what it's like to be royal, I'll take it. Really top quality."
4,bring back the stuarts!,"i am not a fan of the hanoversaxecoburggothawindsormountbatten family, but putting my political opinions aside, this is a fine and objective view of queen elizabeth II in the days surrounding the death of her ex-daughter-in-law diana. faced with a public that chose to view a silly vapid little twit as some sort of beloved martyr, the queen was caught up in a sense of the world that had left her and the rest of her family behind. the movie is a salute to a woman who managed to run a stall action, delaying the inevitable end of a monarchy thats only purpose in the world of the 21st century is to provide a tourist attraction. the entire cast does wonders, esp of course helen mirren in her justifiably praised role as elizabeth, with a special nod as well to janes cromwell as the queens toady philip mountbatten. and of course like all movies about british royals its fun to watch those sets."
4,The Queen - DVD,"The movie The Queen, starring Helen Mirren is a very good film, and those who like historical period pieces, and also documentaries, should like this film.The Queen takes place after the election of British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and the days leading up to and immediately following the death of Princess Diana.The movie basically gives us a behind-the-scenes view of the royal family at this time. It does this by intercutting archival video footage with the actors to enable you to follow the story, and give you some sense of why the family reacted the way they did.Some people say that this movie was more sympathetic to Queen Elizabeth II. However, I believe that this is just a balanced telling of the story, the director wished to tell. I believe no judgments can be made. This movie was another showcase for Helen Mirren, and she deserved the Oscar that she won."
5,WONDERFUL,The movie represents the very best that the film industry has to offer. Treat yourself. You are worth the pleasure that this has to offer.
5,really down to earth.,"This movie is so true,Helen Mirren really brought home the fact that Diana's death brought the Queen into the 20th century.The Queen"
4,anti-climatic yet providing good insights about United Kingdom's Monarchy,"RATE: 3.75 starsThis is the shorters review (book or DVD) that I've written. I took my mom out to see this movie cause I knew she would like it (and I haven't been to a cinema in eons). The overdriving theme in this close-to-real-life drama, is that the anachronistic lifestyle of the monarchy, and the fight between modernist parlamentarian mindset vs. monarchial autocracy. The purely proper British language, manners, and formalism were amusing rather. Also, the story is centered around the time when princess Diana had her fatal accident and how the monarchy responded. Enjoy this short drama (93 minutes).Now I can say, I understand why the Brits say ""God save the Queen!"" ;-)"
5,a sad and funny exploration of society's demand to live only for illusion,"The Queen has been raised to believe in absolute values. But she lives in a dark age of consumerist, media mediated shallowness. When her people desert her for the false image of a demented daughter-in-law, she must choose between what she has been taught is ""true"" and what the marketing people tell her she must ""be.""This film suggests that identity in the modern age is a hoax. We are all whores and we will kill everything we love (pay attention to the scene with the deer: the greatest moment in contemporary cinema) to stay in the spotlight.This is the wittiest, most profound film of the 21st century. Probably there has been no film since the days of ""Pygmalion"" in which the British cinema has come so close to besting Shakespeare."
4,4.5 Stars is about right,"A beautifully produced reconstruction of events during the week following Diana Spencer's unexpected death: the public mourning, the Royal Family's cluelessness, and Tony Blair's attempts to curry favor with all involved. Helen Mirren deservedly won the 2006 Oscar for best performance by an actress, and the rest of the cast turns in creditable performances as well. I'd give this 4.5 stars if that were allowed."
2,Dead Woman Upstages Living Woman,"Couldn't help but notice how the movie kept flashing back to Diana who is DEAD, but that's to keep the audience from fully falling asleep.British Royalty, being the parasites that they are, are completely boring! If no one would pay to come to England to see them, they'd have been phased out last century as the deadwood that they are. They are to be pitied. No jobs, nothing to do all day but go to openings of this or that. Poor Charles even got kicked off his polo ponies because Mumsy thought it was too dangerous.I haven't watched this movie in one sitting. Too boring. This is one where you watch it in shifts, if I finish it at all. Helen Mirren did an OK job, but frankly, Elizabeth is very easy to impersonate and many others have done this before Helen. Think of the stupid Naked Gun movies."
2,Garbage,"A politically correct (and therefore tasteless) look at the British Crown.It is very disrespectful of the monarchy and the Royal Family, and early on plays up the death of Diana (who was a failure as a wife, mother, and human being). There is nothing to commend this disgusting film."
1,The Greatest Fiction Ever Told!,"From start to finish, this was hype and propaganda. Bravo - mission accomplished as the subjects have all bowed low in obeisance here.Actually, in spite of my belief that this was tale-spinning and track-covering, I have great respect for the crown and realize that they do RULE the world. The Isles have controlled everything in the world, and there IS a reason for that. Canadians understand that they are subjects. Americans believe that they are ""free"". LOLOL.Long live the Union Jack!"

3,Queen is only part view,"I was disappointed when I viewed the DVD of ""The Queen"" starring Helen Mirren. I was under the impression that the movie was to be about Elizabeth II's entire life, not just a small section of it...mostly surrounding her ex-daughter-in-law's death. The portion that they told was very good, but I was expecting more."
4,The Queen,"I was very impressed with the handling of this rather sensitive subject and felt that Helen Mirren did a wonderful acting job.The queen was brought up from a young girl to keep her feelings hidden and it was refreshing to see her finally show her true feelings and for people to realize she is a human being and how much she cares.It's not a glossed over version of the Royal Family, their strengths as well as their weaknesses are shown. They are very privileged but still have similar family problems as ordinary people.Judith H."
4,Queenly Stretch,I hadn't read much about the film before renting it so I wasn't sure what to expect.The film covers a few short months in the lives of the Royal family beginning at the election of Tony Blair and ending two months after Diana's death.The plot is slow moving. Don't expect action. Quiet moments of discussion between the Queen and different family or staff members fills the majority of the film.Interspersed between newscast reports of the details of Diana's death are scenes of reaction and struggle as the Queen stretches to do the right thing -- even though it may not feel proper.This is a very well acted study of characters placed in tough and unfamiliar situations.
2,ehh kind of boring,i'm so mad i bought this i wish i had rented it instead. it was wicked boring. I don't know exactly what made it boring but i just didn't enjoy this movie.
1,THIS FILM HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE ROYAL FAMILY---OR IT NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN RELEASED,"Just another bit of fluff about the royal putrescence, don't you know. Too bad they wouldn't allow Unlawful Killing, the documentary about Diana's death to be shown in the US, but then, what would you expect? Just keep slurping up the royal swill, Americans, and don't listen to any of those nasty facts about how they murdered Diana."
2,Not really the queen,"While I had heard about this movie and all the hype associated with it, I bought it without reading the description on the back first. I mistakenly and maybe ignorantly thought that this was a movie about Queen Elizabeth's life, but it turned out I was very wrong. I had a very hard time sitting through the whole thing, and while some of the actors undoubtedly put on a great performance, I found this a very boring film. Had I known this was just about Diana's death and the resulting events concerning the Royal family, I would never have bought it in the first place."
3,Wish I enjoyed it as much as others,"Great performances from all the actors. Have always adored Helen Mirren..... if you do, recommend ""Prime Suspect"" its great.Everyone I know loved it.I thought it was needlessly boring. In times to come think this would seem like a fairly tame TV drama of a historical event rather than the brilliant movie everyone thinks it is.Sorry Your Majesty."
4,"Interesting, but not riviting.....","Definitely a different perspective on the events surrounding the death of Diana. A little slow moving, but still very good."
2,Not What I Wanted Or Expected,"I did expect a portion of the show to deal with Princess Diana. I was hoping to learn more about the Queen's legacy and her life story.This movie is for the Diana loving devoted multitude and perhaps the conspiracy theorists.Tea anyone? No thanks, cappuccino please"
2,A grand movie!,"I certainly understand why this film won Academy Awards - very well-deserved! Helen Mirren conveys more with her facial expressions than most people can with words and gestures. It was a wonderful characterization of Queen Elizabeth II facing an unprecedented situation (Princess Diana's death) and how she coped with and handled her own emotions, the royal family, and the nation. I've watched it several times and expect to uncover even more levels each time I see the film."
1,The queen,"The movie itself was quite good. Helen Mirren is outstanding, as usual. However, I am rating an ""item""; the blu-ray disk that I received (and viewed after 30 days, so I cannot return it) has ""skips"" towards the end. It's really inconvenient to sit through a two hour movie only to have problems at the end. Sigh."
2,Why?,"Is there anybody out there who can explain the world-wide hysteria triggered by the death of ""Lady Di?"" A privileged royal bites the dust and millions fall to pieces? Which part of the human psyche yearns to cry in great crowds? Is it the hanky sharing? The flowers? The Elton John tributes? Its a mystery. But one thing is certain, we should quit it. If we manage to quell this impulse, and learn to blubber like infants in the privacy of our own homes, maybe we could hold our heads a little higher, and boring movies that debase the population would no longer be made.Sure, What's-Her-Face does a fine job playing a grey old woman who stands around saying things, but is that enough? Actually, if you want to get political, ""The Queen"" is pure propaganda. Yet another film industry attempt to simultaneously humanize and glorify our magnificent leaders. Lets drop to our knees and thank The Almighty for providing sober and capable geezers to rule over us all!"
3,Problems with playback,"The movie and storyline was good and kept us entertained. My problem was with the DVD itself. The playback had problems and got 'stuck'/froze at the start of the movie. The only way to get the movie to play was to advance to chapter two and then rewind to the beginning of the movie (without going all the way back to 0:00:00 or the problem would re-occur). I have an ONKYO DVD player and have never had this problem with it, it still plays all of my other movies just fine. I did have the exact same thing happen with 'Deja Vu'. Both of these movies are by Disney companies, could it have to do with the mastering/copy protection? It was very frustrating having to watch the first five minutes or so in rewind before being able to see the movie."
3,Okay,"I don't see The Queen enough from my part of the world to truely judge whether Ms. Mirren nailed her performance. I believed her-her style came off as natural and not 'look-at-me-I'm-acting'. The actor portraying Prince Charles came off as a mimic to me. As for the movie's content and it's overall entertainment value, I agree with the reviewer in this felt more like something you'd watch on A & E's Biography or Public TV. I was fine paying three bucks for a rental than the double digits one would pay at the theater. Take a peek and judge for yourself-I just suggest you go the rental route like I did."
3,The Fossil of Royalty?,"A system that exists from a much previous time broke down when Princess Diana died. The movie is a chronicle of how bad things were, somewhat cleaned up for the press? No matter how good Helen Mirren's mimic of Queen Elizabeth was,the point that seems to be missed is that between them Charles and Queen Elizabeth drove Princess Diana to her death? The Queen should have let Charles marry for love in the first place instead of finding a political alliance that ended in tragedy? The system of royal marriages has ever been broken? Royalty as a system involved in government is a failed one.Historically, the casualties have been enormous."
5,Helen is The Queen,Great DVD. The commentary by the royal biography is excellent. I highly recommend the commentary. It is both informative and entertaining.
3,Excellent Snapshot of the Royal Family,"There is no doubt that Dame Helen Mirren deserves the Oscar Best Actress award. Her ""portrayal"" of Queen Elizabeth II gives viewers moments of illusion that she were the queen. But all we can really see is a snapshot of the royal family, because no one can possibly know their private thoughts and conversation behind closed doors. It may be interesting to contrast the royal family's reactions to the public pressure and scandals by looking at the past.Edward & Mrs. Simpson, a 5-star topnotch TV mini-series may provide that opportunity, and Actor Edward Fox's King Edward is as compelling as Helen Mirren's Queen Elizabeth."
5,Helen MIrren does Queen Elizabeth,"A five star acting job for Helen Mirren. Sometimes the award shows get it right.Given that no one knows anything about the Queen that she doesn't share, Mirren is dead on in her portrayal. Every member of the cast in fact is right on in presenting their characters. I've watched it a couple times and it really holds up."
4,Solo Bro,"This recent offering by Gregg is no doubt his strongest since ""Laid Back"". His solo outings have always featured his love of R&B and gospel. His offering of ""Whipping Post"" is a great stripped down version of the Brothers classic, and his version of John Hiatts ""Memphis in the Meantime"" has a nice groove to it. Overall a great complement to any ABB collection. Also try and find ""Laid Back"", and his double CD of ealy solo and demos ""One More Try"", which offers a look into the genius of Gregg Allman."
5,good old blues,"GREAT CD FROM THE VOICE OF THE ALLMAN BROTHERS FILLED WITH BLUES THAT ARE GREAT, BEST CUTS ARE THE REMAKE OF WHIPPING POST AND IVE GOT NEW FOR YOU, AMUST FOR ANY FAN OF THE ALLMANS BROTHERS"
5,Great relaxation music - wonderful for the soul!,I just love Dan Gibson's music!! I recently left another review on his Windsong album -- truely his music helps me so much with my work. I am an end-of-life midwife and use music to keep my patients calm and peaceful as they approach death. I have always felt that this music really does help my patients remain in a serene place until they pass away out of this life. It has touched many lives.
4,Good Biography...Great moves,"Where 'Inside the Lion's Den' Leaves off, this book picks up. Beyond chroniciles shamrocks early pro wrestling days along with his reign in the UFC, his move 2 WWF, and finally his return to MMA. Written in first person, Shamrock comes across much more humoriously than 'Inside.' Of the books 278pages, 212 of them R NHB technique instructions. Having practiced MMA on a much more amature level, I can say that the techniques contained in it are both effective and basic. Shamrocks descriptions get to the heart of each move, teaching the most important parts of ever technique, and explaining them thouroughly.All in all, this has to go on the shelf of any MMA of UFC fanatic."
4,Finally a mma instructional!,I'm very happy to see a fighter finally show us some mma moves.The contents are as follows;1)Striking-21 moves.2)Clinch work-17 moves.3)Leglocks and guard passes-13 moves.4)Top Control Submissions-27 moves.5)Guard Work-14 moves.Overall there are 100 techniques plus a biography of Shamrock's life.Sorry for not remembering exactly how the book is organized;but there is indeed 100 moves inside.My only two problems with this book is that;Shamrock doesn't show how to strike when down on the ground and doesn't cover escapes from the bottom of inferior positions at all.
4,Good Instuctional interesting biography,"The biography part is pretty interesting. He mostly talks about his pro wrestling days and after. In his first book, he focuses more on his life before pro wrestling. I liked the idea of a bio/instructional because it adds some credebility to his technique.The instructional part is good. He provides a lot of techiniques for several different situations. He goes through the techniques step by step in detail so the reader fully understands how to perform the techniques. His first book had some nutritional and exercise advice, however this book does not. Despite that, I would strongly recommend this book for Shamrock fans and people who are interested in training in MMA."
4,A Bit Overblown But Interesting,"Ken Shamrock gives a short autobiography to start out the book. The story of his life is interesting but he seems to overstate many aspects of his life and fighting carreer. His stories are at times not believable and he makes excuses for every fight he has ever lost. Using excuses such as being hung over, bum leg, took fight too soon, other guy on pain drugs etc., Ken comes off as a sore loser quite often. Regardless of his padding his own stories, it is interesting none the less.The second part of the book is on fighting techniques. This section is well illustrated and worth the price on it's own. This is a good buy for fans of Shamrock and the UFC or anyone who wants to study the Lion's Den Fighting techniques."
1,Dissappointment,"I have over 50 martial arts related books and this was a huge disappointment, i actually bought it and ended up returning it the following day. I liked his first book The Lion's Den, but just like Ken himself, this book hasnt evolved further.So many better MMA/Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu/Muay Thai books are available.Please dont waste your time with this one."
4,Forget the monkees,I love this CD! Nesmith as everyone knows was the reason the monkees were great. I like his solo stuff better. I can only take the monkees in small doses (except the porpoise song album). This does have a very heavy country influence but avoids all the crappy country cliché's.Silver moon is my fav song and I never tire of it. You get a lot of songs on this CD and they work well mixed up in playlists.easily worth 15 bucks. Get it!
3,Too small to be called a sofa,Should be listed as a love-seat or large chair. It is way too small for two kids to sit comfortably.
2,"Good series, bad book","Strange Matter is one of my favorite book series (why'd they cancel it?), so I thought this would be another great book in the series.How wrong I was.First off, the cover is totally different. Instead of having that cool ""Strange"" being red with lightning and ""Matter"" having that green 'substance' in it, they simply wrote ""Strange Matter"" in orange letters. If that's not enough, instead of having a great computer-generated picture on the cover, it instead looks like a drawing.Then we get into the story itself. It didn't have any of the things that made me like the previous Strange Matter books. It didn't have much action, it didn't have the same suspense, and it didn't have the same ""feel"" to it.It's hard to explain exactly why I didn't like this book, other than the fact I felt a feeling of emptiness while reading it. Whatever it is that Strange Matter was good at, it wasn't in this book."
3,"Great for home theater, not so great for music playback","Luckily I purchased these manufacturer recertified directly from Harman for a decent price and only the sub woofer was altered but still as new.They look nice and can play very loud. These speakers are initially designed for home theater and with a $500 to $800 price tag I would give them a 5-star rating.However, it seems Harman wanted to save literally $5 on some decent damping material. Music sounds as if it's coming from a hollow can, especially the sub woofer. I find this quite embarrassing for a well-known speaker manufacturer so for music playback I give these speakers a 1-star rating.I think I'll void the warranty and add some poly-fill myself. This will absorb reflections and give the speakers a more natural sound."
4,Serves the purpose,This cover is perfect for preventing this from falling in your pool between uses. It saves alot of time from having to clean extra debris out the pool. It does require two people to put on and take off to avoid things on top of the cover falling in the pool as you remove it.
2,"EEHHH,,,,it kinda works....","Just an oversized, thicker, piece of blue bubble wrap. It helps warm the warmer...after 5-7 days...you get what you pay for really says it all on this one. Does not wrap over the edges as in the picture either. Save your money! Buy a pool heater."
3,15 ft. Intex Pool,"I returned the pool. It arrived in time, but we decided not to use it. We returned it within a week."
2,A rose by any other name,"I would rather read a so-so book by Mel Keegan than a ""good"" book by almost anyone else, but I have to admit this one is the weakest of all Keegan's books I've read. I did not like the main characters, Sir Edward seemed wimpy and Paul was irritating. I like roles clearly defined: who's the dominant partner, who's submissive? And I'm not even talking about sex. Also the ""history"" was too politically correct. I would have preferred straight fantasy and a made up world and culture. There was not enough action, and too much thinking. Too much Angst on everybody's part. Also, I don't get why Keegan set up a rape scenario and then backed off--the backing off was totally unreal and made Paul less likable than ever. This was kind of a downer."
3,"Good basic examples, But don't expect applications","If you want a foundation, this book is great. But let me warn you after this book you will probably not be making WSS applications like you would want."
2,Absolute waste of money,"This book is atrocious...plain and simple. There isn't a single thing in here that couldn't be gathered by glancing at the SDK documentation. Not to mention, it's wrong!! When was the last time you were able to access objects via the ipp provider and have your way with them?? according to this book...you can...interesting..."
2,Web applications??? Not in this book,"If you think this will help you with using Exchange for web applications, think again. The first chapter that mentions the web is Chapter 12 on page 533. All the examples up til then are in VB. On the positive side the book gives a fairly detailed theoretical background to the Exchange 2000 development environment, but it still leaves me looking for a book on Exchange 2k web development."
1,Not very Web or Collaborative,"I bought this book expecting that there would be a lot of web application samples as well as collaborative samples. However, most of the book is written in VB! I couldn't even find a complete sample application. If you want to learn how to build collaborative web applications, I'd recommend another book that either has web or collaborative technologies in it with SAMPLES!"
2,I would not suggest buying this book,"I agree with Ms. Peters. The book gives little code for the web, does not address issues that come up with IIS. 95% of the code is in VB, and when transported to ASP does not work. In many cases the code itself does not work. If anyone knows of an up-to-date book that is actually useful please let me know.On a good note... the book is rounded. If you can debug it, it is useful."
3,"Readable, but slanted","Granted, this work, like all of North's, is extremely readable. You do not require a vast amount of knowledge on the subject before starting this book. However, there are several instances where a clearly conversative agenda is endorsed. The most noteworthy example is the presentation of what North labels ""theological liberals"". Efforts are clearly taken to persuade people against these individuals. This conversative agenda is also apparent in the lack of information on the more liberal wings of the Restoration Movement. A history book such as this should not be this slanted. Three stars for the simple reason that it is readable."
5,Well Met!!,This was a very educating read for the student of the Restoration Movement or the Church History in general (American History even). This book is full of interesting and often obscure pieces of information that will intrigue as well as educate.Highly recommended!!!
3,Puffed Out with Air,"This book has some interesting things to say about how the practice of silent reading and the practice of putting spaces between written words are mutually reinforcing. Correspondingly, in cultures where reading is primarily reading aloud, written languages tend not to have spaces between words. But most of what the book has to say could have been said in a couple of articles. It is very repetitive and the author has a remarkable ability to use a lot of words to say very little."
1,There are better Tchaikovsky's than this.,"I agree with the other reviewers who gave this cd 1 Star. Lang Lang does not look deep into the music and its expression. This CD is not acceptable to those who heard Tchaikovsky's First Concerto many times and understand the musical values hidden. Alexis Weissenberg once said that Tchaikovsky's First Concerto is easy to play. However, it takes a true musician to express it musically and understand the music Maturely! Lang Lang is young. I am sure he has lots of time to develop his interpretation skills. But this CD is not the definite Tchaikovsky. If you want flashy performance of the Tchaikovsky, go with Gilels, Argerich, Horowitz, or even Pletnev and Cliburn for deep understanding of the music. This CD does not fall into either of those two categories in my opinion."
1,Worse than ever !,"Honestly, these are the worse recordings of both Tchaikovsky and Mendelsohn ""klavierkonzerten"" I've heard in my whole life !In Tchaikovsky, it seems that Lang_Lang is under psychotropic medication... Valium ! Exagerated rubatos, too slow tempos... He runs against the music ! Tchaikovsky should be trying to escape from the grave for destroying this disc.The worse part is that I'm loosing confidence on Deutsche_Gramophon... Why to release a recording like this ?"
1,The Worst Tchaikovsky's Concerto,Very disappointed. Lang Lang again focused on showing-off his technique instead of interpreting and playing the music with his heart. A very pretentious rendition. The worst Tchaikovsky's Concerto No. 1 in my collection.
2,Boring,"When I first bought the album with great expectation, I cannot get through the first 5 minutes while going to airport. I am so frustrated and stop the disc and change it to Horowitz' recording of the same. I even thining of throwing the album away. I find that the reason to keep is the good sound delivered by CSO."
5,The CSO is the star here!,"I've heard this recording, and although I truly enjoyed the pianist, it was the orchestra that enthralled me. The warmth and beauty of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra was incredible. If you appreciate top quality in orchestral sound, this is a must buy."
1,EFMendelson,"Quite possibly the most pedantic and uninspired performances of the Mendelssohn and Tchaikovsky concerti you could find. In the right hands, the opening movement of the Mendelssohn G Minor (e.g. as played by Rudolf Serkin or Murray Perahia) is one of the most exciting of all the romantic piano concertos. Unfortunately, as played by Lang Lang it devolves into a slipshod exercise of mediocrity. Lang's phrasings in the opening passages of the first movement are atrocious. I would have thought it an impossibility to eliminate the propulsive tension Mendelssohn created with this work but Lang Lang proves otherwise. The 2nd and 3rd movements suffer a similar mauling. As for the Tchaikovsky 1st, you can probably hear a better performance by the average senior piano major at your local state college and it won't cost you as much as this CD."
3,too technical for me.,"I did compared Lang Lang's Piano Concerto No.1 by Tchaikovsky with Martha Argerich's CD (live performance). I would say with the SACD format and Lang Lang's technical skills, I would give this the top score, but it just do not have the energy presentation and passion deomonstrated by Martha's live performance which reach deep into my heart. Is it too technical a disadvantage?"
1,Horrible Tchaikovsky,"I completely agree with one of the earlier reviewers, this definently has to be one of the worst interpretation of the Tchaikovsky concerto no. 1 I have ever heard. Lang Lang doesn't have deep insight into the piece. His interpretation is cold hearted with a lot of student-like phrasing which makes him sound very immature. The Mendelssohn does suit him a little better, but I would reccomend other recordings for both concerti. I do agree with the other reviewers that the orchestra is really very good here. I would recommend not spending your money here when there are many greater Tchaikovsky concerto no. 1 recordings such as Argerich, Cliburn, Horowitz, Gilels, Rubinstein, definently not this one. For the Mendelssohn I would reccomend either Perahia or Serkin."
1,One of the worst Tchaikovsky 1st ever!!!!!!!!,"In his recording of Tchaikovsky 1st, Mr. Lang seems to have misunderstood the difference between playing musically and playing sentimentally. There is almost no phrasing in his interpretation that has got sense. All he tries to do is ""improvising"", which is obviously very sad for the composer. Also, in many places (particularly in the 1st movement), Mr. Lang doesn't respect the text at all - the basis!!-. Playing differently for the sake of playing differently or for some kind of excitement is always very disappointing. I strongly advise Volodos' recent version of the Tchaikovsky (with Ozawa and the BPO) instead, which is FAR better."
5,"Tchaikovsky, Mendelssohn: First Piano Concertos","Tchaikovsky, Mendelssohn: First Piano Concertos is a 2003 Deutsche Grammophon recording starring pianist Lang Lang. Daniel Barenboim leads the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Phillip Huscher has written music notes. Included are several photographs from the time of the recording. Higly recommended. 5/5."
4,Maturing,"Just finished listening to Live From Lincoln Center the New York Philharmonic's New Year's Eve program With Lang Lang in an all-Tchaikovsky program featuring Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1. Absolutely thrilling, with everyone at the top of their game. While I understand some of the critical gloss on Lang Lang, who can be annoying and mannered, the current edition going into 2011 is extraordinary. A masterful artist, but more to the point, a musical charismatic equal to the material. The gulf between a great critic and a great pianist is large, and great critics are more rare. Trust your ears. The only reason I wouldn't recommend an early performance of these concerti is because he gets better every year. Find the most recent possible and follow this star."
3,OK,I bought this and thought it would be the best game ever. But it was a bore after the secend day! So you would like this if you like easy stuff.
4,A nice movie licensee,"Toy Story 2 differed completely from the console versions of the game, but it's still a pretty good game. Once you get the hang of the awkward control scheme (Press A while standing still to jump, A while walking to run), the game is actually pretty enjoyable.The storyline is very similar to the movie's, but for some reason, a deleted scene from the movie is used as a setting for the first level (Woody falls out the window).The gameplay is pretty good. There may be just about 10 levels, but the game is pretty fun to play.The music is alright. It sometimes sounds good, but one background song might sound dull. The sound effects are acceptable, too.The graphics are good for the Game Boy.Overall, it's another stellar movie game."
2,expected more,"this game had short and very few levels.there wasn't much to do after you win, and i won in only two days.this game is only good because it was based off of a movie.don't waste your money."
4,A fun game for small children!,"My 5 year old has this game...he loves it. It's perfect for him. There are a lot of games out there that are too hard for a kid his age, but Toy Story 2 is great! If you have a young child, this game is perfect! But for the older ones...it may be just a bit too easy."
1,Another sub par game with popular characters.,"Toy Story 2 could have been great. Toy Story 1 on Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis were excellent. Toy Story 2 is not. The graphics are somewhat detailed but kind of blurry. That's ok because gameplay makes a great game not graphics. The gameplay is where everything goes wrong. You see, the run and jump buttons are both the same button meaning you have to hold down the button to run but if you let go Buzz jumps. This will cause you to loose many lives very easily and get you fusturated. If you want a good platform game for Gameboy Color, Tarzan is much better with better graphics, control and a unique hide and go seek mode as well as the ability to use the Game Boy Printer to print out Tarzan Stickers."
2,gets boring quickly,"This is an okay game but there's only four levels. Which gets really boring because you finish all the levels and then that's the end of your game. It also gets really annoying because you have to hold down both buttons to run and only one to jump, so a lot of times you jump when you don't want to and lose lives. There are a lot of funner and more complex games with more to do out there."
3,Sub-Par graphics and hard controls make this not a fun game!,"Ok, i rented this game a while ago and im glad i didnt buy it. The world Buzz was in was too large, making him too small and he seemed drowned. Also, it was very difficult to get him to move the right way. The premise is good and the levels ok, but its the movment that really kills it, causing A LOT of frustration..."
5,Monica and Arafat,Difficult if not impossible to put down. The information contained in this book is not for the faint of heart and would be impossible to accept if not for the superb documentation and the credentials of Bodansky.Clinton's non-action when faced with the gangster like actions of Arafat and his fellow gangsters are impossible to accept and calls for legal action against Clinton if possible.Go for it Yossef
3,Useful But Not Comprehensive,"Mr. Bodansky's book is useful but not comprehensive. For example, the chapter, ""The Road to Damascus,"" begins with the election of Ehud Barak in May 1999 and describes in detail, including US participation, the subsequent events that led to an aborted Syrian coup.Mr. Bodansky omits any mention of the the meetings that occurred between June 19 and June 21, 1999 with the presidents of Syria and Lebanon and James A. Baker, former secretary of state, and Edward Djernian, former ambassador to Syria. These meetings were not secret and, in fact, were covered by the Arab press."
2,The finest endorsement an author can receive,Unusually gifted is this man Yossef Bodansky as he again penetrates the fog of Islamic terrorism and presents accusatory new evidence of not only the Muslim adversaries of the United States but also reveals the incompetence of United States administrations.His unusual depth of knowledge allows him to state his case in a scholarly way that progressively builds on events and inexorably leads us to the sad circumstances now facing the free world.One can only smile as we envision the faces of the Clinton's as their misdeeds are exposed for the world to see.This book will not only infuriate the Muslim world as did Bodansky's last book about Bin Laden...
3,"good book, but...","This is a great book, but like so many of this size (270 pages) it could be condensed to 1/5 of it's size. Every exercise is written out, often on all string combinations. Just giving the reader the intervallic formula of each exercise would provide the same info. Same with Mick Goodrick's voice leading book which could be condensed to about 10 pages.The actual content is very helpful in getting a solid grasp of various picking techniques, sweep alternate, string skipping... Once I'm through with this book, I'll definitely buy the 2nd volume."
2,If just speed is your thing,"If just speed technique is your thing, then you might like this book. But if you prefer melodic, soulful playing, then this isn't the right book.If you want to be shredder, then he displays some good things to work on. But if you listen to Mr. Zucker's playing on other recordings he shares you'll hear technical prowess and technique (i.e, sweeps) often just for the sake of it. In other words it doesn't always fit the tune and sound melodic."
3,Not bad,The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because the tracks are taken from SoundChoice karaoke but the brand of the CD still makes good karaoke CD's
5,momd,"The best blanket we bought for our little boy! Out of all the blankets we were so graciously gifted, this one lasted the longest and remained soft and resilient. Now our boys are 4 and 6 and we use it for my new little niece's and nephew's. WONDERFUL blanket!"
4,"Good book, limited scope.","At least better than 3 starsThe book is good for getting across what it wants to, but does not cover all material. I used this and the Nash IDG one. Neither had all the information (like NWLink and both were severly lacking in the troubleshooting dept.) However, they both provide enough to get through practice exams quickly. That way you can focus on questions pertaining to information they don't provide. Take notes and do as many practice tests as you can, I did and owe my 900 score to it. Beware the new drag and drop questions! The included CD was questionable.My test was 30 questions, non-adaptive."
3,Buy it for the test engine,"This book has a clear and concise explanation of the sevenlayer OSI model. It does not fill you up with arcane detail, ratherit includes only the essentials of The Essentials. The test engine (on the CD)has so many errors and mismatches (3 or 4 per 60 question test) that if you can consistently pass the tests you will pass the MicroSoft test. The question base for the test is too small. A good guide to passing the test, but learn the material too."
3,Not THAT good,"I'm not sure who thinks these questions are as good as Transcender (must have been the author), but they obviously have never taken a Transcender test. The questions are too easy and have quite a few errors.The book is better though and contains enough information that one could use this as the sole study guide for the exam with enough experience. DON'T rely on these study questions...pick up Transcender."
3,"Basically a useful tool, has some flaws.","Overall, I found this book to be well writen and a useful companion to the MS Press Official Curriculum textbook on Networking Essentials. I would not recommend it as a ""stand alone"" study guide for the MS Networking Essentials exam. (70-058)The Networking Essentials For Dummmies book directly contradicts the MS Press Networking Essentials book on several issues/specifications, and the practise test module on the CD that shipped with the Dummies book I purchased contained many errors, including some answers that were mis-matched with the questions, some answers that contradicted the MS Press book, and some answers that contradicted the Dummies book.On the other hand, the author of the Dummies book is very clear about focusing on certain key issues and specifications for the purpose of passing the 70-058 exam, and I found that to be very helpful.Again, I think it's a valuable tool, but I wouldn't trust it as ""gospel""."
3,Very good but not complete...,"I found this book to be very helpful. It provided everything that was mainstream about the test but upon doing the test I noticed that Microsoft had put in some really obscure questions. My suggestion is, supplement what you read in this book with at least one other source. Especially if this is your first exam!"
2,It only covers part of the information,The author has some good test taking advise. He recommends studing. Some of the information is the book is irrelivent. Most of the other information is only coverded superficially. If you want a simple book about computer networking this book will be for you. If you want to be a Network Enginer and solve real problems and empliment real solutions then find a more throuough book. This book will not help with the test.
2,Definately not the end all be all,I read only this book and took only this test (on the CD) I was getting 950's on the CD. I took the actual test and failed with 680. Pooey.
4,"Great book, almost enough to pass the tests.","This book provided almost all of the info you need to pass the 70-058 net essentials test. The Net Essentials tests is the most challenging of the four tests I have taken, but I managed to pass it first time round. I used this book to get an understanding of the information and then the Microsoft Readiness Review to secure it. This book tought me what I needed to know in a logical, easy format. If you are familiar with this stuff, you can skip whatever you are confident with also."
4,"Good book, bit short on info","This was a good book, it covered most of the basic information needed to pass the Microsoft course, without going too deeply into specific subjects, which is a good and bad thing.I found i still couldn't do all the microsoft practise tests after reading this book, as it missed a few key areas covered in the Networking Essentials Exam.Its more of a study guide than a complete inside out tutorial of Networking Essentials. But i still recommend it!"
3,Enjoyable,"On Elysium, a colony of settlers is slowly expanding through the annual arrival of a colony boat from Earth. Conflict between the city of Port of Plenty and the outlying settlements begins to build when things do not proceed as planned on one Landing Day; a split-perspective narrative supplies observations from both within and outside the main civilisation as the established way of life begins to fall apart. Elysium's aboriginees form the mysterious counterpoint to the human and AI politics responsible for the civil war.""Secret Harmonies"" won the Phillip K. Dick Award, but, while it's perfectly enjoyable, I don't feel it stands out sufficiently to justify such honours."
4,Accurate title,"This book contains exactly what it professes. The authors do not take for granted ANYTHING, regarding your prior knowledge of painting and of stained glass. Every step is very detailed, with cautions of ""traps"" that they themselves fell into when they were learning this craft.The only negative item about this book is that it was written in 1979 and technology has changed and therefore the ""new"" items and their use do not have the advantage of the author's sage advice."
4,A comment about this edition,"I love e.e. cummings' work. This is no exception. I don't want to review the content of this book, just a note on this edition. The newer edition from Liveright in paperback is probably much prettier, but if you're into retro 70's dustjackets (kelly green and orangy brown) and you'd like to read the poems the way they looked (because with cummings in particular, the look of the poem IS important) fresh out of the typewriter, this edition is for you."
3,a novel concept,"In masterpiece, Glover has managed to stumble onto an amazing, thought provoking concept which raises questions about the value and place of contemporary art within our society. Her research and insight into the seven great masterpieces (ranging from Da Vinci to Klimt) is astounding and it's wonderful how she works her life indelibly into the paintings and we take on her eyes.She decides to sell herself as a work of art and for seven days she will act out one of the seven masterpieces. Yet in exploring the history of the paintings she is forced to confront her own history and those which she thought she'd left behind.However, as a first novel it only survives well because it has grapsed a good idea and her voice and style could use some improvement. Glover has the imagination and the potential to be a great writer but lacks experience to really pull it off."
5,AWESOME WORKOUT!!!,"I have a ton of workout dvds - and this is by far one of the best I own! Kristin is one of my favorite instructors. Her Power Yoga dvd is also fantastic. She's so positive and INCREDIBLY strong. Her energy is definitely contagious! This is a surprisingly tough workout. Kristin really gets your heartrate going and the pilates moves completely target your abs. Mine were so sore the next day - in a fantastic way! I love it!! The time factor is also awesome. I love having the flexibility to do one or both depending on how much time I have. I really hope Acacia produces more like this one. I think there are a lot of of us who enjoy pilates/yoga, but want to have cardio incorporated as well. NICE JOB KRISTIN!! :)"
3,They should warn you,"Kristin is very strong, very focused & flow oriented. The dvd does what it says; gives you a hard core pilates work out with enough cardio to keep your heart rate up. There are two sequences to choose from. My problem is this: they should tell you this is for people who have done pilates before. Due to the flow form instruction or prompts to get you from one exercise to the next are minimal at best. There is also no tips on how to modify if you aren't a master pilates person. It gets frustrating when you feel left out from a series and this can happen here if you can't keep up. If you've done a lot of pilates, this is a great dvd. PS... she does these ""flippy flops"" in the cool down which could destroy your knee joints. Just sayin'...."
5,Hard,"This video is hard. I'm a fairly fit person and I do the whole DVD in one sitting. But I've realized that despite running and biking for much of my life, I have very little hip strength. Her 2nd workout includes a lot of lateral leg raises. I'm terrible at it. But I'm grateful for this DVD to help me improve. I think this will help prevent injury in the long term."
5,Good work out!,I tried this workout when i had ondemand videos and really liked it. I decided to order this dvd when they took on demand exercise TV away. I love being able to get up and get right to exercising. The second video is alot more total body and more cardio than the first video. If you want a good pilates workout and want to see results i highly recommend this video.
5,Tough workout,"I never did much pilates prior to doing this workout dvd and that was sort of a mistake. It is really, really hard and many times during the workout I need to take a break. I think that's a good thing though. My experience with other dvd's is that they tend to be a little bit too easy after doing it for some weeks. This one though, will continue to make me break a sweat. I love that there is variety in it. I would recommend the dvd but it's not for someone who is totally out of shape. I have worked out daily for 3 years and this is still very challenging for me."
3,Too challenging for me!,"I purchased this DVD because it is title 'Weight Loss Pilates'. I took that to mean it was geared to those with some extra poundage to lose. In other words, those that are not in the most physically fit shape, but not in awful shape either. I found this workout to be extremely frustrating. Kristin McGee is so enthusiastic about what she does, which is great. But she is also quite obviously a professional. The exercises were to close together for me and just plain too hard. I really wish there were varying levels offered, perhaps a beginner's, intermediate and advanced? At the very least, a second person demonstrating how to do an easier version of the moves.I really think this DVD should have a different title. How about Powerhouse Core Pilates?All in all, this seems like it would be a very effective workout for someone who is already in good shape. Guess I'll keep looking..."
5,Great Pilates Workout,I absolutely love this workout DVD! This is a great workout for those new to pilates or those looking to add something new to their routine.
3,Tough workout!,"I've been using this DVD every other day for a few weeks now, and my abs have gotten stronger. I'm able to do parts of the workout now that were too difficult at first. But, the production values on this DVD aren't great-- looks a little blurry on a high-def TV. I also agree with another reviewer that this DVD really would benefit from showing adaptations for moves that cause discomfort or are too tough for a beginner. Her explanations are good, but the expression on her face is somehow annoying to me. Possibly because she is smiling constantly and makes everything look so easy, when I'm struggling!"
4,Great workout!,I have always been active done and sports and have even done 60 days of Insanity. So I was looking for a less intense workout that'll be easier on my joints. I thought this dvd would be a piece of cake but it's pretty challenging yet easy to follow so I love it. I already see more muscle tone doing this in combo with other pilates workout. Great Dvd!
3,Difficult & moves very quickly,"The instructor was very nice and perky, but it was really difficult to follow along with the video since many of her exercises were not explained well and she moved through each exercise almost impossibly fast. Obviously she is in great shape and I'm very happy for her, but I doubt that anyone who legitimately wanted to lose weight with pilates would be able to follow along with her. I would suggest blogilates or a baptiste power yoga vid instead of this one - it was honestly just too quick without any real explanation!"
1,Not recommended,"This product is for people who are already very good at some type of activity like yoga or ballet.What I disliked most about this video is that she never offers an easier option. I have several exercise videos and when things get more complex or difficult there's always an alternative instruction. It doesn't feel at all researched, instructors usually appreciate that their clients aren't all at the same level of fitness or ability.I also feel that usually instructors switch between the areas going from legs, tums, arms etc, doing so makes the exercise more bearable. This video seemed to stay on the same area for ages.I don't think I'd like this video even if I was good at pilates."
4,Great collection!,"I grew up listening to Jerry Clower. This is such a great collection, I'm buying one for my dad!"
2,Fascinating history poorly presented,"The history of the 1871 Polaris expedition to the North Pole and the mysterious death of it's leader Charles Francis Hall is poorly presented by this effort. It is well researched but the book would have benefitted greatly from an effort to edit and organize this presentation. If you are interested in the history of these events, a reader might look elsewhere for the information."
3,An Excellent History Written Like a Dime Store Fiction,"I was very glad that I read this book, but also very glad that I was finished reading this book, if you know what I mean. The story is fantastic, and what happened to Hall and his team contains instructive lessons that can be applied throughout history and today. BUT, my god was there some bad writing going on here. For example, Parry LOVES the word inexorably. EVERYTHING moved ""inexorably towards""...something else. I lost count after the 27th usage of the word. Also, it couldn't be ""bitterly cold"" it had to be ""a cold that would cut to the mens very souls and challenge their will to survive it"" or words to that effect.Without the authors weak stab at poetry, the book would have been a lot shorter, and a much more enjoyable read."
4,Very Good Read,"I had to purchase this book for my Women in Other Cultures classes at ASU, and I quickly found that it does not read like a textbook. It's a very easy and fast read, and it provide lots of statistics to help visualize facts about women around the world."
3,For a class,I got this book for a class and ended up reading most of it. Topic was interesting but not really my cup of tea.
5,Can some9one verify . . .?,"Yes, great soundtrack, perfect adaptation. I ask: can someone tell me whether I am imagining things, but . . . the background music to the final battle scene: the future Henry VII chasing Richard III at Bosworth Field . . is that not an adaptation of Isaac Albeniz's ""Asturias"" from the Iberian Suite? Thanks!"
1,Way off from Norton's Edition,"Alright so I purchased this, hoping it would help in my reading of Richard III. Boy was I wrong! In the first part during Richard's initial monologue the creators add a bunch of lines then completely skip the scene with Richard, Brackenbury, and Clarence and go right into scene 2. This item should tell possible customers that it is not accurate to the play because now it's just money down the drain."
1,whatever?,"oh god...I dunno, it's kind of an album uuhh... with....um...songs on it and stuff......It's very possibly not the worst thing I've ever heard but don't hold me to that ok? um....ciao for now"
3,An infomercial?,"When I see a caption for an illustration that reads something like ""Experience personal customer design consultations in the tradition of the old mantel masters, Wohners' one-on-one sessions ensure the highest quality of your mantel design and selection,"" I can't help but wonder at the purpose of the book as a whole. I did find the section on the Rumford Fireplace interesting, and the mantels shown intriguing, but as for actual designs that I could build I found the book lacking. In fact many of the designs in the ""Mantels Portfolio"" reminded me a great deal of the ""mantel"" which was on the fireplace of my first residence --- a mobile home.I did give it 3 stars for the ideas, but practical information given is minimal."
3,Limited ideas,"Interesting history, but I was hoping for more mantle plans. The pictures of mantles were few and small in size so not very helpful on that count."
1,Garbage,"Does not fully dissolve in water. Leaves your tank looking cloudy, and will completely ruin all of your filtration media within a few days. Does set your tank to a pH of 7.0, but only for a day or 2. You then find yourself having to add more and more in order to stabilize your pH. That fact, along with the fact that it doesn't dissolve (leaving tank very cloudy) and clogs your filter, and you have yourself one absolutely terrible product here. Avoid at all costs."
4,The Meices Rock,"I just recently heard The Meices and they are the typical band that don't get the publicity that they deserve. Most people have never even heard of them but I assure you that if you just give them a try, you will like what you here. All of their tracks are really good. If you like stuff like MXPX and Homegrown, I am sure that you would enjoy them. COME ON, GIVE EM A TRY!!!"
4,Hold It,"Bought this cd strictly for the song ""Hold It""The song was from a transworld skateboard video years ago, titled fourwheeldrive. It was the only song that I could not find on itunes or anywhere else. I wanted it to complete the collection, and now that I have it its finished.The rest of the cd is kinda meh, but the ""hold It"" song is definitely worth the price i paid."
1,This is a piece of crap.,"I took one of these spatulas out of the box, put it together, tried to use it, and it came apart on the first squeaze.So, I put it together again, tried to use it, and it came apart on the first squeaze, once again.Then I repacked it, and sent it back to the company that sells them. It really is a piece of crap.Then, I realized that the one I wanted was the Double Metal SpatulaDouble Metal Spatula,which is made in Germany, and puts this spatula to GREAT shame.I would not buy this one, I would not recommend this one, and I would not accept it, if they gave it to me.It is a total piece of trash, and not worth the price, even if they give it away."
2,Don't put in dishwasher!,"I have been looking all over to find another ""double spatula!"" The one I originally had came with a set of T-Fal WAY back in the 1970s. When I saw these on Amazon, I bought three of them! I opened the first one, and washed it in the dishwasher before using it. ALL of the chrome coating came off the handles. I washed it two more times in the dishwasher and it still feels tacky. If you buy one of these spatulas, DO NOT WASH IN DISHWASHER! I can't imagine why in 2010, you have to wash a spatula by hand for it to last."
4,antimicrobial healing effect,"I take this traveling with me in case I get any cuts or scrapes. It has come in very hand a few times, and heals my hand. There is no the burning sensation of alcohol or hydrogen peroxide, so you know its gentler on the body."
4,the shipping is expensive,its'good but i spent much on shipping. make it expensive. i wont recommend it to any.but it's really good thing.
5,Great itch and bump reliever!,"This is a lovely itch and bump reliever ointment. My son and I have been getting bitten up by bugs this summer and this thing helps us from going nuts and ripping our hair our from the itching and constant scratching. I have to have this on hand for when we travel, or really its perfect for a diaper bag. I highly recommend this for the summer months when creepy crawlies start making their way into your skin."
1,ugggh!,"This cd sounded like the put a drunk in a studio and said play anything you want! Some of the tracks are just noise, and not even ""pirate"" like sounds."
3,Pirtate Songs,"I got this for my [...] year old who loves everything ""Piratey"". The CD is ok. Some of the tunes sound the same, only they have a ""laughing"" voice played over top of the music. I also bought the POTC Curse of the Black Pearl soundtrack. I'm happier with that one. The only thing the Great Pirate Music CD has going for it is the POTC theme song they included at the end of the disc. I'm glad I bought 2 different CD's...my son is happier with the POTC CD."
2,Party music,"I purchased this cd only for a party we threw for a friend. It worked fine, but probably won't be used again."
1,Pirate Music?,"So, this is that ""pirate music"" all the kids are downloading nowadays? I don't get it. Sure, its nice, but I can't imagine why anyone would spend hours and hours downloading songs like this. And people get sued over it! Pirate music is fun to listen to, but its not worth going to court.I guess my suggestion would be this: avoid pirate music. Buy cowboy music instead."
3,Gets the Job Done,"With the proliferation of complex wireless headset, I am pleased that Jabra is still making a simple wired ear bud. I have had several of these over the years. Each version has been less expensive and less-well designed. The current ear piece design is a bit on the fragile side. The speaker casing comes apart easily and, once it does, it is very easy to detach the small wires that make it work. This is not what you want for tossing casually into a big bag. However, if you can keep from smashing it, it works great."
5,Best one so far - and at a cheap price,"I have tried so many earbud/earpieces for my mobile phone. Of them all, this is the best. The piece goes right into the ear (with no complicated around the ear loops) - it stays there (you get different gels to fit ear hole). The sound is good on both ends... I find that it lasts about a year - (I have bought three for myself over the years); the earbud eventually gets detached.... but, for the price and product, if I got a couple of months out of it I would be glad. Definite buy!"
1,"awkward ear pieces, clicking sounds","The only good thing about this headset is that it has a 2.5 connector without needing an adapter. It comes with 3 sizes of strangely shaped rubbery ear piece covers - all of them are way too big to fit in my ear without popping out constantly. The directions say to twist them in to your ear, but they won't go into my ear far enough to even twist. It also comes with 2 thin foam covers that you can use instead of the weird rubbery ear piece covers. But the foam covers are so loose that they keep falling off the ear piece. When I try to use the ear piece without any cover, it is scratchy against the skin. The worst part is that the ear piece continually makes a loud click-click-click in my ear as I carry on a conversation. This headset, unfortunately, will be going back."
5,Idris Elba is brilliant,"Idris Elba is as good as ever in his role as the rogue cop. He's not only good, he's brilliant. I was introduced to Elba when he did his role in Daddy's Little Girls. When I watched this series, I love it so much I wanted to see more. If the USA tries to Americanize this show it will not last and you can't compete with a role like Elba's Luther. I salute to the guy for his brilliant portrayal. For anyone who did not know, Elba just won the Golden Globe for this role and I say it is about f***ing time. Congrats Elba congrats"
4,Idris is wonderful in everything,"I will start by saying i am biased because i love Idris he is extremely beautiful and talented. its so wonderful to see him in a lead role. That being said this is a very interesting series. It was a little to raw and disturbing for me i fast forwarded through the showing of the crime scenes. But, I like the way the characters interact. Very good acting and very good writing i just wish it weren't so gruesome.The way the series ends is completely unbelievable you will be on the edge of your seat especially the last a few episodes. It for sure makes you hope they make a season 2. Really good work."
4,good drama,"One of my favorite dramas. I found this on netflix last year and quickly caught up on the first 2 seasons. When I saw the season on Amazon at such a great price, I snatched it up! I highly recommend Luther as a gritty, intense police drama from the UK."
2,Idris Elba is great but story is cliche-ridden,"MINOR SPOILERSThe only reason I give this 2 stars instead of 1 is because Idris Elba brings the wonderful intensity and intelligence he had in The Wire as Stringer Bell to this character. However, this series is a barrage of detective cliches that the actor (and the other fine actors) simply cannot elevate. There's the character of Luther, a loose cannon who can be tough and yet is smart and sensitive. Of course there is a scene with police superiors worried about Luther constantly breaking the rules, of course he has an estranged wife with a wimpy boyfriend, of course there's an attractive psychopath who both taunts and tries to seduce him, of course there is a killer who Luther can make break down in tears when confronted with Daddy issues. Nothing slightly new or interesting."
3,Pretty standard,"I'm amazed by the glowing reviews. Sure, the plots are solid, the acting is good, but the topic has just been done to death, surely. Luther is another angsty, ""maverick"" (ie, selfish, thoughtless) detective with little self-control. The intriguing twist is that he has a serial killer just fascinated with him. Why, is anyone's guess, since she's supposed to be so brilliant. I appreciate the effort, but I just don't see it. Sorry."
4,season 1,"We're really enjoying this DVD and plan on getting season 2. Weren't able to find it at video stores or the library, so bought it from Amazon. Love ""Luther"" and the stories are very interesting. Great TV show."
5,WHEW,I am so glad my sister introduced me to this show! This is a real punch in the gut series. I'm on a limited income but I'm glad I ordered this-so much so that I've ordered season 2 also.
5,great series,This is one of the best police dramas out there. Series starts off great and finishes even better. Very well done.
5,Luther,Excellent series...entertaining & very well-acted! DVD quality is very good and my shipment was received within 3-4 days after I placed my order.
2,"Few laughs, fascintating not","I read this one after finding it mentioned in Bill Bryson's Made in America. Since the former isn't very interesting, it's no surprise that this one isn't either. If you want chatty anecdotes about the inventors and their madness, this is for you. If you want to see how inventors have really made an impact on the twentieth century and living standards, then you'll have to dig a bit harder."
4,Great History of Technology book,"Excellent reading. It begins with the history of the invention of the lamp and goes all the way to the invention of the computer. Great historical references and a very unbiased view of the history of all inventions.My favorite chapter is on the invention of the Television, which has not one but 5 inventors.Great reading."
1,A book about exploitation? And the book is not?,"Finkelstein, in writing this book obviously is exploiting the Holocaust to sell a book. He is not giving it away as a matter of public conscience raising is he?"
5,"This guy is an anti-Semite. Oh wait, he's Jewish?","Then in that case, we will call him a self-hating Jew. This binary scenario basically sums up the depth of the thinking about the Jews and their ethnic pride in the US, by most Jews and non-Jews alike. Mr Finkelstein is to be applauded for having the courage to tear off the blinding PC wool that has been pulled over our eyes and examine a sensitve issue critcally."
5,He dares to speek the truth !!,"Finally , a book that makes sense of that part of History.. I always wondered why our Government is willingly blindfolded and allowing that kind of corruption to take place ..I recommend this book for someone who is ready to see the Truth.."
5,Great 80's music,"Too often the cool 80's music such as the Specials, Clash and English Beat are forgotten and the crass 80's crap is what's represented in any 80's themed movie/cd compilation. Not so Grosse Pointe Blank. All the great music is here. Make sure you get vol 1 and 2."
3,"Wonderful, quitrky and fun.....(3.5 stars)","This is a great soundtrack that really captures the sprit and style of the movie. The songs are commercialized punk and reggae mostly from the 80's that are light hearted and fun. Blister in the Sun, Mirror in the Bathroom, Under Pressure, I Can See Clearly Now, Live and Let Die, and Let My Love Open the Door, are all ditties that we know and are popular for a reason. We Care A Lot by the Faith No More is a great as well and Rudy Can't Fail is sub par Clash fare. Overall the order of songs and the selection amount to great soundtrack that is light and easy to listen to."
2,An average follow-up to Volume One,"After loving the film, and then purchasing the first soundtrack, I thought I should follow suite with Volume 2. Unfortunately, I found this compilation disappointing in comparison to the first. It has some good 80's songs (A-Ha's Take on me), but the overall feel did not have the upbeat ""ska"" feel of Volume 1. If you loved the film, get the original soundtrack."
4,Grosse Pointe Blank Film Score,"Loved the movie and the music score. We were disappointed that the song, ""99 Luft Balloons"" wasn't included on the CD."
2,Grosse Pointe Blank Soundtrack,It didn't have all the songs from the movie. Some wereEven on the album twice. Different versions. Yulk.Could have been a little better.
3,Almost as good as the movie.,"This is a random mix of 80's songs, that I find to be half excellent, and half ok. The better tracks in my opinion are ""Blister In The Sun"", ""Rudie Can't Fail"", ""Mirror In The Bathroom"", and ""We Care Alot"". I also really like the song from ""Pete Townshend"". However, I don't think we really needed two tracks from ""The Clash"", and two versions of ""Blister In The Sun"". ""Live And Let Die"" also gets on my nerves. But if you're a fan of the movie, or most of these songs, then you can't fail with ""Grosse Pointe Blank""."
1,UTTER CRAP - DON'T DO IT!,"The soundtrack for Gross Pointe Blank was a great one, featuring some of the more mainstream hits of the 80s and quite a few of the harder-to-find club hits. However, THIS STUPID CD is not a complete soundtrack for the film. You will only find the pop songs on this CD. You will not find even ONE of the rarer tracks you may have been looking for and expected to find. Whomever the idiot was who decided which cuts to put on the CD needs to look at available compilations. I think you can find most of this over-played CRAP on about a HUNDRED other available compilations. Just another example of how Hollywood and the mainstream music industry generally refuses to take ANY risks at all, and doesn't really have a CLUE as to what's cool and what's not. It's truly amazing that some of the cooler songs made it into the film. How sad that the tuned-in genius who picked those songs didn't get to choose what went into the CD. Enjoy the CRAP!"
5,What a wide array of sounds!,"A friend of mine bought this album before I did and I knew after I had heard it once, I would have to buy it. Initially, I bought it because I am a pretty big Specials and Clash fan, but after listening to the whole thing, I was very impressed. It has a great combination of older stuff (Femmes, G n R's cover of live and Let die) along with some great cutting edge stuff. After listening to the soundtrack, the movie was not nearly as impressive as I had anticipated. Great album!"
5,Great soundtrack!,"This is one of my favorite soundtracks. The songs are a nostalgic overview of 80's rock, with emphasis on ska (""Absolute Beginners,"" the Jam) and punk (""Rudy Can't Fail,"" ""Armigideon Time,"" the Clash). There's also the swelling chords of ""Under Pressure,"" a very nice collaboration of David Bowie and Queen, and Guns 'n' Roses' dramatic hard rock version of ""Live and Let Die."" Fun album that will probably bring back memories and definitely make you get up and dance!"
3,Dominatrix Recorded from a Scratchy Vinyl Record!,"This CD contains good tunes, but if you are looking for a CD version of ""The Dominatrix Sleeps Tonight"", look elsewhere. That's the only song I bought this CD for, and it is recorded from vinyl, and not just vinyl, SEVERELY WORN VINYL, with dust, scratches, and pops!Quite a shame the studio didn't go through the effort to acquire or borrow the source recording from the artist. The rest of the tracks do not appear to be sourced from vinyl."
5,"Natural, Plain Common Sense!","This book is written in a direct, straight forward style that brings clarity and logic to the issues this author addresses. She does an excellent job of outlining natural goals, e.g. developing esteem, originality, individuality and confidence.While there is no one answer and no ""one size that fits all,"" Jan Hunt applies good old common sense and advocates people to trust their own beliefs and to recognize the individual needs that their children have.The ""natural"" parenting aspect comes into play by shedding preconceived ideas; rejecting faddish treatments and dancing to any tune a degreed expert might call. The salient points in this book are the ones about keeping an open heart and an open mind and being willing to recognize one's children's needs without being judgmental or subjecting children to inappropriate professional treatments. Jan Hunt is a sensible, logical person who really is a natural expert."
5,Love is the Essence,"Hunt's best seller exceeds the expectations of those who are in search of a new paradigm for living a more fulfilling experience either as parents or as simple adults learning the ways of life through children. It's a book to be read by the heart. It maybe be not an easy task to recognize in our habits some of the ""Whys"" our own children, now young parents,had so many trouble copping with traditional education guidelines inherited from us and that we already knew that it did not work a bit. It could not, it would not, it will never work. It lacked the essence of love.The love that understands the needs of a baby, the delicacy of a new born soul and the complexity of self inner construction that only the parents' unconditional love can inspire with self-esteem and trust. Hunt's book is about this love."
4,Introduction to Natural Parenting,"Jan Hunt provides us with a wonderful introduction to what is termed ""Natural Parenting"" and the premises behind the approach. There are some great insights in these pages, which give the parent permission to put aside some pre-conceived ideas about their role as parents. These allow them to see the child in a new light, as someone on the 'same team'. Children are then given permission to just 'be' and to develop at their own pace, within a loving, encouraging environment. This is a releasing experience for the parent when they realise that they don't have to meet an external standard, imposed by someone else and neither does the child."
2,A disappointment,"This is a collection of Hunt's essays and many of them say the same thing -- over and over again. Basically, she reiterates that a child is a person too. As a fan of attachment parenting, I already know this and found the book to be quite boring.That said, if you come from an abusive household and would like some reassurance as you try to break that pattern, this book may be helpful. She touches on that scenario quite often."
1,Ideological tripe,"Mostly interesting because 25 years after the book dominated the evangelical attack on humanism in public education, the language and paranoia are still fodder for the movement.Obviously, fundicons will love this book and liberal intelligensia will hate it. I'm neither. As a Christian who does not identify as religious right, I personally found the book's checklist of political issues absolutely maddening. I don't think there's an inherently ""Christian"" way to view nuclear power or balanced budget legislation, and it galls me that someone purports to claim that there is.The reaction to this book will be so tied to the politics of the reader that objectively reviewing it is impossible."
5,This is a great CD,"i recommend this CD to anyone who likes punk music. i think it might be defined as pop punk which i usually can't stand, but this band does without the whiny voices like you would hear on new found glory or the new blink 182. the instrumentals in some songs remind me of millencolin but the lyrics are totally original. i've never heard anything like this before, every song is a great song and they don't try to mix it up by trying different things on their cd. even though the CD is only about a half hour long it seems a lot longer because the lyrics and instruments blend so well together. if you like punk like rancid or millencolin or any other band you should definately get this cd. i can't really put it into a category because it reminds me of so many bands."
5,Sound amazing,"These speakers are awesome, I wish the sub would hit a little more of the highs and not so much lows but the other speakers i got work good with that. I have these using a sony AV reciver and they put off some awesome sound."
1,Poor Warranty back-up,"Don't buy because of the lack of warranty back-up. Mine worked for two months and the sub woofer went out. It has been over two months and counting for it to be repaired. Harmon does not send out parts in a timely manner, and at times doesn't have the parts to ship. Harmon won't respond to your emails for help either. It takes about three weeks for them to ship parts, and if it doesn't fix the problem, they make no effort to expedite the repair parts or help out. The local tech told me this is very common with Harmon. I have seen the emails back and forth from Harmon and it is dismaying. Stay away from Harmon products."
4,Great speakers,"These Infinty speakers are awesome. Price wise, quality and sound is amazing. I am very pleased with the sound quality."
4,near perfect,"shawn smith has been a favorite of mine since i heard him singing back-up on an afghan whigs record. smith is amazing. he's the most overlooked talent of our generation. you have to see the man live.sure, the album has a couple clinkers, like the bouncey ""without love"", but once you hear ""criminal justice"", ""breathe deep"", or my persoanl favorite ""roll on"", you'll be overwhelmed. and then you'l scramble for everything you can find by shawn.check out the first twilight singers album. it features three of the most talented artists in music today, smith, greg dulli (previously of the afghan whigs) and happy chichester (of howlin' maggie). good stuff. the new howlin' maggie record, ""hyde"" is great as well."
4,One of my all time Faves,"Mere words escape me when it comes to Shawn Smith (& Company). I have yet to find any another musician(s) who effects me the way Shawn Smith does. If you have never heard any Satchel, this is a great place to start. Pivitol in the careers of all involved, this piece is beautiful, raw and amazing. I also recommend Shame, from Brad, an equally incredible CD. This is real music, for individuals who aren't afraid to look inside themselves. Hop on the train, you might like the journey, because there's alot more where this comes from, this is only the beginning...Brad, Satchel, Pigeonhead, Jeremy Tobak, Shawn Smith, Steve Fisk, Stone .... The list goes on. Buy it.lolliegirl444l@yahoo.com"
5,This album can make grown men cry!,"'The Family' is the second offering from Satchel,and in my opinion is their best album to date. Shawn Smith proves ones again that you don't need boyband looks to sing like an Angel! This album will have the hardest of men in tears. Unlike previous projects such as 'Pigeonhead' and 'Brad' this is a lot more mellow and soulful. 'Criminal Justice' is just a top tune, definately a must on the old stereo when snuggling up with that special person in your life :-)"
4,Where Can I find this Album?,"Amazon does not have this album listed as being out of stock or out of print, yet there is nothing to click on to purchase it. Where can I find it, or what is wrong with this Amazon page? Thanks!Erin"
5,Buy Barrow's Cairn Terrier book,"because it contains the most concise information and is also a good buy. When I sell my Cairn Terrier puppies, I always send a Barrow's Cairn Terrier book. The book is included with the purchase of the puppy to help the owner answer all their questions in regard to their new Cairn Terrier puppy. I also consult it myself for answers to questions. The pictures of the Cairn Terriers in the book are of good quality and variety."
5,Take a chance... well worth the gamble!,"The case is sturdy and seems like it will last a long time! Chips are nice quality. There are 2 decks of crummy cards, but I didn't but the set for the cards. Thanks!"
4,Well worth it,"I was going to buy Bicycle 300 for 70 bucks but this is worth it.650 with 11.5 for 50 dollars. Enjoying my poker game.Quality: initially clay particles/dust came off when un-boxing but after couple of plays,chips are smooth and heavy. Worth every penny."
1,"Cheap Looking, Low Quality Poker Set","The printing on the chips is all-over the place; looks like a four year old painted the chips, paint is fading, no clear lines etc. I wish i could return this item but shipping is prohibitively expensive. Would go for better quality next time."
3,"Not quite what I expected, but still ok","The price was the best bang for the buck that I could find anywhere: 650 pcs for $50. I thought that the chips would be painted, or stamped, though. Instead, they are ""dressed"" in a vinyl wrap. On a few of the chips, the glue has slightly seeped out and stuck to the next chip. Easy enough to clean up, but it just cheapens the set. The case has been ""modded"" with custom inserts to hold the chips, but there is a 2"" gap on the right side. Again, cheezy. I like that the colors actually show the denominations."
4,It's as funky as you can get with your clothes on.,"This cd is one of the funkiest cds ever and the only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because George Clinton, the founer of intergalactic funk, let's his guests do most of the work. But what it lacks in Clinton it makes up in funk and causes this cd to be a must buy."
3,Funk and B,"This is a lower type of album for Clinton. Having listened to his earlier stuff and seeing him live recently, I decided to pick this album up when it was on sale. It's definitely nothing compared to previous releases, but it's something.Funk is something that is not changing, but morphing, slowly. You have Dr. Funk himself here and obviously he's the sole proprietor for change. In this particular record, which was released 1996, you have the change of tides. R and B was and still is big, so he infused his own jam and sound into it. There are even hints of classic gangster rap. It's a total different blend here...and it's taking a bit longer to get used to.To think this is new, I'm out of my league, but it's different, especially after listening to Clinton for awhile. This is not your average Clinton album, but it's a nice one to add to the mix. It really shows how diverse an artist he is, which is always decent. All in all, not his strongest attempt, but nonetheless, an alright."
2,wer'e funkadelic put a smile on your face,"this was good george clinton back in the house with the whole funk mob on here if anybody gets funked up is an instant funk classic belita woods goes off but on the first mix you get erik sermon and mc breed rapping and summer swim is another p funk hit and should have made radio play this song is good and funky kind has a nice mellow beat that's good to your earhole. other good jams include new spaceship, rock the party and my personal fave sloppy seconds featuring bootsy collins, and bernie worrell."
2,Lame,"I had purchased this album when it was first released. It is quite dissapointing, but a few songs were listenable *for the time*."
2,He Could've Done Better!,"This is not the typical George Clinton that I'm used to hearing!The only standout songs are ""If Anybody Gets Funked Up"" and ""Funky Kind"". It sounds like George and the band were tired from all that Mothership touring from the 70's."
4,Goshawk and the Legend of Ooozi,"This book has been compared to ""The Wizard of Oz."" A journey into the Redwoods with Ooozi in search of something he can call his life. He loads down his mule named Trinity and off they go. They meet special characters as the journey progresses, animal friends and fairies, knomes, and visit strange places. You'll love reading this life-like journey, you will fall deeply in love with all of the characters and even Ooozi himself. The events that take place will put you right there wondering what ought to be done. It is written in Southern Varnacular slang, just read the words the way they are spelled, a different touch on upper youth reading."
3,"The ""Legend"" to a Child's Fun!","Jensen has done a remarkable job in creating a wonderful piece of fantasy. It is a story for young and old alike in where the main character Oozi tells the reader of his wonderful adventures.The story is told by Oozi in a broken type of english, unanimously thought as the deep south, therefore making it a hard read in the beginning. Yet, by the second chapter it becomes all the more easier, and it flows like water.For all those that loved Harry Potter, I highly recomend this book for children, as well as adults.Enjoy it!"
3,Get 16 Greatest Hits Instead,"George and Tammy may not have been meant-to-be romantically, but they sure were made to sing together. Let's face it: George Jones could blow most of his duet partners out of the water, but Tammy not only could keep up with the guy (musically), but have her own spotlight moments. Listen to him dip into his trademark baritone at the two-minute mark of ""Something To Brag About"". Tammy follows him right along, allowing him less than a second to use that vocal trick that upstaged many other singers. It's a moment to smile at. For all of the tears in their songs, there were a lot of downright happy ones too.All of these songs are excellent, but a compilation missing ""Take Me"" and ""Near You"" cannot be considered complete. Please get the 16 Greatest Hits instead and enjoy."
4,Good but too specific,"This book is very valuable for who own or make repairs on those cars, but regarding engines it just mentions the 6-cyl units, forgetting the small0block and the big-block Darts. Onm the rest the book is good."
4,A Hidden Gem,"Like everyone else here, I agree that this recording is badly overlooked. There are certain times when I prefer the softer side of Eric to the blues droaning of Layla and Assorted Love Songs. This recording has gospel, regaae, and acoustic flavorings as well as just a touch of the blues. Eric's singing is a lift muffled but his tone does compliment the songs very well. The last four songs were all written completely by Eric and let me tell you that they all have good chord progressions especially High. I would recommend this CD for those fans of Eric who can appreciate him as a total musician and not just a blues purist."
4,Outstanding early Clapton,"Amongst the early Clapton albums, this one has oddly kept my attention longest. Starting off with two talented interpretations of Gospel classics, this album is strangely personal for early Clapton material. The cover picture, of a forlorn dog, is the mood the album puts you in. Often forgotten, this album has tremendous diversity - the blues of 'The Sky is Crying' to the upbeat but melanchonic last four songs - Better make It..., Pretty Blue Eyes, high and Opposites. Wonderful playind, soft singing and a mood is created."
2,Let's Get Real Here...,"I would have given this 3 stars just to be polite to a man whose music I respect very much but with all of the 4 and 5 star reviews on this site, someone needed to step in and provide some balance. Swing Low Sweet Chariot is nice and EC's cover of The Sky Is Crying is pretty good but I'd lean toward Elmore Jame's original or SRV's before this one. I'm a long-term EC fan, from his days with the Yardbirds on. If I had a penny for every time I've listened to him play a tune, I'd probably own Amazon! So I love the man and his music and I'm not calling this a BAD disc. I'm just trying to put some dynamic range in the rating process. There are people out there that use these reviews to make buying decisions and if you're one of them, I'd hope that you already had at least 20 Clapton CDs before you point your credit card at this one."
4,Mellow Period,"I really like this album from Clapton's mellow 70's period, especially 'Better Make It Through Today', which would have fit nicely on his '461 Ocean Blvd' album."
5,What a great album!!!,WOW is all I can say. Why did I have to buy this online? No stores stock it! Why!?!? PLEASE buy this!
5,One of his best.,"Good groove, great songs, excellent guitar work -- short but fast and tasty licks on Better Make It Through Today, Pretty Blue Eyes, High, Singing the Blues -- add up to make, in my mind, one of his best studio efforts."
2,Be Forewarned,"I am a great fan of Edward Lucie-Smith's books so I was delighted to find, what I thought was, a new book listed. Unfortunately when I received my copy of Erotica: The Fine Art of Sex, it turned out to be a slightly updated version of his 1997 book Ars Erotica. The new version with a very different cover, has an additional 32 pages with twenty new images. The rest of the book is exactly the same as the first with the same illustrations and text.If you do not own Art Erotica by all means buy this new version. Had I not had the first version I would certainly have given it five stars. If, however, you own the original the new images do not really add that much to the book and I would certainly not have purchased it had I known I was going to be so dissapointed."
1,Nothing special - and identical to Arthur Bryant's!,"First of all, this sauce is really bland, which is disappointing since it's supposed to be ""hot"". It's about as spicy as Heinz ketchup, so if that does it for you, you'll be satisfied. I bought a bottle of this and a bottle of Arthur Bryant's (from their website) and ... it's the very same sauce! Close your eyes and you cannot tell which you're tasting - even the bottles are identical except for the labels! At least the Rendezvous was less expensive. If you're looking for a bottle of spicy BBQ sauce I'd recommend Big Bob Gibson's or Willingham's."
2,Dissapointment,"If you are looking for the the open TV version of this all-flesh movie then keep looking. This product is a censored, cuted-out-scenes movie that is not worth neither your time nor your money.I thought the TV version was quite good (what can you expect from a softcore movie?) but this is just a lame version."
3,"A Well-Acted, But Not Quite Fullfilling Kiss","Judas Kiss is a gay drama that I was pretty much indifferent to. I had put off seeing the film for a while because the trailer didn't exactly look like my cup of tea. I prefer gay comedies to gay drama. Now after watching the film, I can say that the movie really isn't my cup of tea. There were some interesting scenes here and there, and it was well acted. Sean Lockhart, better known as Brent Corrigan, is great eye candy. But the movie as a whole just didn't gel with me. And it is pretty far-fetched. And as one other reviewer mentioned, there is no similarity between Charlie David and Richard Harmon, who are playing the same character only 15 years apart."
2,There Was Nice Cinematography,"I'm trying to find nice things to say about this movie. I like Charlie David, especially in that LGBT travel show. But, I wasn't buying this performance. And have to agree with the 1 star review... the acting was not good, the dialogue was questionable at times, the premise was questionable as well (and I like SF movies), and other than Charlie David and Brett, the dudes weren't that handsome (if that was the what you were looking for).Some of the movie was predictable. I really had a hard time believing the younger self. His pouting kind of annoyed me too.The campus setting was good, the lighting, the cinematography, make-up, sound... all pretty good as well. The music was a little plodding. I guess the directing wasn't bad as well. But the main part of the movie... the story and acting... IDK. It could have been better. I don't think I can recommend that people waste time on this because if they did it would be a waste of time."
2,Another proof that...,"cute faces aren't enough to base a film on.I know that probably fans of Charlie David hate me, but I must write it. Just because he may be regarded as handsome (not my type anyway) doesn't mean he is a good actor. ""Judas kiss"" is his another cinema journey to...nowhere. He plays all characters on the same note. His behaviour on the screen made it even more difficult to put up with the flaws in the plot.His ""younger version"" fails too. His face shows always the same expression. What disturbed me as well was lack of any physical resemblance between those two characters. WHat was the casting director thinking, I haven't the faintest idea (check as well the lack of similarity between father and son).To sum up, I didn't like it and I am gonna get rid of the dvd."
1,Don't waste your time,"Pretentious time travel movie about failed film maker who goes back and forward in time to meet his younger and older self, and in doing so attempts (and apparently succeeds) in redeeming himself and his career. This one has it all: incomprehensible plot, bad acting, bad dialogue, bad songs, unpleasant and uninteresting characters. At an hour and a half, it goes on about an hour and a half too long. Don't waste your time."
2,judas kiss,Very weird movie about a gay who sleeps with his younger college self to maybe alter his future. Strange dvd!
4,Worth Watching,"I am a big fan of Charlie David, so anything he is in, I will like. The premise is a bit off, supernatural, kind of thing, and it takes a while to catch on, and once you understand what the idea is, it is predictable. But figuring out what is going on is worth it. I watched again right after the first time, and found it so enjoyable it went into my favorite movies stash. (those that if I can't find something, I can just reach in and any I pull out is one I would enjoy watching no matter what).And I must say, Brent Corrigan is getting to be a pretty good actor. So far I have only seen him in bit parts, but I look forward to seeing him get bigger parts."
4,Good Quality to price ratio!,"We use this flag only infrequently, but it is a good value and worth considering. Constant day in day out use would result in pretty quick wear on material."
4,Good value,I purchased three flags from this company and was very pleased with the quality and delivery time. There was a slight mixup on the shipping and the customer service took care of it immediately.
3,Sky Cries Mary-'Fresh Fruits For The Revolution'(World Rev.),"'Fresh Fruits...' is the only Sky Cries Mary release I think I've ever had.They're a Seattle based six-piece that plays neo-psychedelia.The disc is not exactly a mind blower,but it's okay.The cuts I liked best are ""Movement Of Water"",""Moonbathing"" and their two covers,the Stone's ""2000 Light Years From Home"" and Pink Floyd's ""Wot's...Uh The Deal"".Line-up:Roderick & Anisa Romero-vocals,Michael Cozzi-guitar,Juano Davison-bass,Ben Ireland-drums and Jill Wangsgard-keyboard.Might appeal to some fans of Kula Shaker,Lenny Kravitz,Gwen Mars and possibly Blur."
3,interesting,"simple, straightforward language with alot of sentiments some of which seem a bit too much for my personal taste. What stands out in this short book is Gertrude Stein's genuine and pure curiosity in people/culture/history and her clarity in her ownership of her own perceptions...very refreshing."
4,Very good game,"If you're a fan of the genre then this is for you. It's the combination of the 2 micro machine games from the NES or SNES. So you get 2 games, however the 2nd one is pretty c**ppy. Loads of levels to keep you interested with heaps of different vehicles such as 4WD, Dune Buggies, Trikes, Helicopters, Sports Cars, Tanks (you can shoot missiles at other players) and even a Monster Truck bonus level. This game is sweet."
3,"Clear summary of Hoover's philosophy, but a little dated","Hoover wrote this book during the 20s, when he felt that American ideals were under siege from the collectivism of Russia and the socialists. He gives a very straightforward explanation of why he feels a mixture of free-market capitalism and voluntarism, which he believes to be uniquely American, is the best prescription for human societies. Although Hoover wrote this in earnest (he did, after all, lead the Belgian relief effort in WWI), it rings a little hollow when you remember the Great Depression of a few years later. Read this book to understand Hoover, not to be inspired by his philosophy."
4,"Good, but not the best","Any Flecktone fan will of course add this to their collection, but the 'Greatest' Flecktone work is 'Live Art'. The two new tracks are classic Flecktones. Buy 'Live Art' first, and then you'll want 'Greatest Hits of the 20th Century'."
3,Loved the shirt until I tried it on.,"This is another shirt that fits much smaller than the stated size. It says XXL, but can't be any bigger than XL. I have several XL shirts that are actually bigger than this one!"
1,Poor.,"Movies like this remind me that Quentin Tarantino has had far too much influence for his own good. The film is dull and poorly scripted, with bland characters and an unfulfilled aspiration to hipness. I'll give that it has an occasional stylish moment, and an occasional funny line, but most of the ""style"" seems contrived and forced and the majority of the laughs, for me, were unintentional. Although you have to give it to James Spader -- I don't think he *will* make a movie unless he is going to be having sex with one of the attractive female leads at some point. The theory holds true here, in a terribly unnecessary and out-of-place sex scene. Don't get me wrong, though, it was one of the few scenes I enjoyed."
3,Pulp Fiction for the Valley Girls and Guys,"I agree that Charlize Theron was amazing in her star quality, easily eclipsing that of Teri Hatcher. And I also agree that Spader has a gift of introducing some beautiful actress to the world by having sex with her on screen. As a whole, all of the characters are laughably airheaded, and the sentiments are laughably maudlin, and the plot laughably contrived. But it's entertaining, and worth renting."
2,That's Mr. Hitman to you,"If they ever remake The Day Of The Jackal (again), they should cast James Spader as the hitman. He can look a lot like Edward Fox, and he exudes cold, masterful self-assurance.The rest of the cast is OK, but the script and direction are third-rate. This movie is nowhere near Reservoir Dogs; don't believe the hype."
2,A sort of poor man's Pulp Fiction.,"Make that, a sort of _very_ poor man's Pulp Fiction in fact. A film about gangsters and other shady characters in a multiple/ intersecting plot with disjoint time lines.What more do you need to know except that this one is nothing like as good a film as Pulp Fiction?The script and the acting were of a standard that you would expect from a soap opera that had been around for too long. Did the film have any redeeming qualities? Well, I laughed at one joke and that seemed to be quite a good one. But, that is not enough to make the whole film worthy."
3,"An interestingly quirky,suspensful film.","I liked the movie.THe cast is one of the better ensembles put together in recent memory.The plot is a little convoluted and contrived,however it is saved by fine individual performances.The movie is worth viewing if for no other reason than to see Charlize Theron,what a beauty she is!Very talented as well,she is a future big-time star in the making.The catfight she has with Teri Hatcher is great,best part of the movie.If you like good actors,sexy women and the wierdness of California,2 Days In The Valley is a pleasant little diversion for 2 hours.I recommend it and I think it has potetial to be a bona-fide cult hit."
4,Great entertainment!!!!,"I can watch this film over and over again and still it find it refreshing and fun. Very well casted and written. Where were the nominations for Oscar? This is one film that deserved to walk away with many awards but as usual Oscar overlooked one of the really great films of the year. Kudos to the writers, the cast and the director. Humorous, yet dark. Funny while sad. Too many great things to mention. See it for yourself and find out why I highly recommend it."
4,"great movie, but actually fullscreen","This DVD is actually fullscreen format.On a full screen tv, there will be bars on the top and bottom of the picture.On a widescreen tv, there will be bars on all four sides, if you set thePicture Size to 4:3 to view the movie with the proper aspect ratio.Depending on the player and the tv's capabilities, you may be able tochoose a picture size that will at least eliminate the bars on the left andright sides of the picture - while preserving the aspect ratio.My widescreen tv will only do this, via picture size 'Zoom1', if I lower theresolution by using a DVD player without 1080 upscaling. This entails usingcomponent video or other lower-resolution inputs instead of HDMI input."
4,Great Service,The service was great. I received my video quicker than was expected and it was in perfect working order. I will use them again.
5,Great Read aloud,I read this book to my 6th grade class this first day of our school year last year and they all enjoyed the book. At the end of the book it showed the real Mary Smith and the kids were all interested in it especially to hear it was based off a true person and story. Would recommend for 2nd grade and above to truly understand the message.
5,"Art, Astrology and Chocolate!","A beautiful book for folks who like art, astrology and chocolate. The drawings are delightful, the stories charming, and the information and ideas about chocolate will send to right out to the store to buy....chocolate! Buy for friends, for birthdays, Valentine's Day or just to have for yourself. Enjoy it."
2,Besides being a little creepy...,this is plain wrong. Neither I nor any of my Fire-sign friends enjoy bittersweet chocolate. This is ridiculous and strange.
5,Classic,Arguable the best movie Jackie Chan was in ( Operation Condor ) worth the price and purchase! You wont' be disappointed if you enjoy his films.
3,"If you are looking for a sequal to TA, this is NOT it!","I bought this game because I really loved playing TA (Total Annihilation). The user supplied maps and units for TA really made for a lot of variety, and I thought the graphics were cool. TA Kingdoms seemed really slow (as in not very interactive). The graphics were OK, but they seemed like a downgrade from the really crisp models they used in TA. It was annoying to have the computer fire at me from far off screen where I knew he could not see my units (this was a problem in TA too, but less of one, in my opinion). The setting for TA Kingdoms sounded exciting, but it seemed like the different Kingdoms had a very set way of doing things and once you figured it out you were all set.Overall, I thought this was a pretty boring game. Go for TA instead."
2,Not what I expected,The game is extremely slow and boring. It takes forever to build up a formidable force. I thought it would be more like the original TA(which wasn't exelent). The good part is its 5 different forces as opposed to StarCraft's (which is a much better real time strategy) 3.
3,It's your average game,"This is probably closer to 3 and a half beuse of a few nice features, such as the loading screen is a stained glass that fills in. But the actual game has a really easy campain and really hard skirmish. There are may different units for each different player. You pay for everything with mana that recharges depenting on the number of loadstones and divine loadstones that you place. I would recommend buying it because of the cheap price."
1,Slow moving and tedious,"After Total Annihilation, this was a HUGE disappointment. In particular, the way all units trudge slowly along, even when under fire makes it look like even they cannot be bothered. I certainly can't.Slow to load, slow to run, slow to play, loaded with portentous music and yet totally unabsorbing. A typical games consists of spending a very long time making huge numbers of utterly undistinguished units then watching them amble slowly into battle. Rarely do enough make it to achieve anything. Then it's time to start all over again.On balance, I would rather watch my screen saver. Which is odd, since the original TA is still my all time favourite (and most frequently played) game. Bring on TA2!!"
1,not up to TA or the hype,"Amazon's review is accurate. The gameplay rewards the hedghog. Strong points from TA remain (unit ordering, squad numbering, ...)but if that is all there is, then TA is a better buy/choice."
3,A little dull for the subject matter,"Most of these interviews are dryly academic, as McCaffrey tries to relate this diverse group of SF authors into (or out of) the recently acceptable literary schools (mainly post modernism). There is some action--Sterling for most of his interview, Disch on certain other authors--and McCaffrey doesn't always stay with the academic format, but most of the pages are such snoozers. In every interview there is the inevitable ""who are you reading"" and ""who are your influences"" questions, which are interview cliches, but still prove to illuminate something about each author, if only ""how"" they answer these interminable questions. I enjoyed the Sterling, Wolfe, Delany, and Butler interviews the most. Benford was an incredible bore, and Burroughs walks all over the feigning McCaffrey."
4,Thought-provoking and convicting,"This should be a must-read for everyone who claims to be a Christian and also supports the death penalty in the United States. I'm guessing that because the writer is a lawyer and wants to make his point bullet-proof, he repeats himself frequently, and that becomes tedious. However, the meat of the book is incredibly challenging. It is a wake-up call to use the entirety of Scripture in our approach to criminal law, rather than thoughtlessly picking and choosing sound bites to support an only marginally thought-out point of view."
3,Sizing Really Matters,"The url given in an earlier review for sizing no longer works. I eventually found the following information on another web site.Using a tape measure, measure around your head just slightly above the ears. If your head measurement in inches is:20 1/2 to 21 5/8 = size Small; 22 to 22 3/8 = Size Medium; 22 3/4 to 23 1/8 = Size Large. Keep in mind that the caps are made of latex rubber, and do stretch. Also, if you have long thick hair, you may want to go up one size and if you have short thin hair, you may want to go down one size."
2,Purple Cap smaller than white,"I have ordered the white cap in a large twice in the past. This time I ordered the purple one and it was much smaller than the white and I had to return it - very disappointing. The white worked well when i had it, however, with regular swimming it does need to be replaced every year or so as it eventually rips."
1,Yikes!,"I bought this because I have been searching for a comfortable swim cap that comes in large. Felt good when I put it on, but when I put my head in the water, it was so buoyant, I had to force my head into position for swimming. It may be great for paddling around, but not a good choice for lap swimming!"
2,Was going to give raves,"My friend and I both bought this. We loved the cool retro look and the promise of it keeping our hair dryer. And it get high marks on both counts. However, after having it about a month, both of us found it had developed tears."
5,great fit,"I ordered 2 of these and think they are awesome. Look much better in person, then is picture. Real 3d effect with the bubble texture. They fit great and I can't wait to use them in the water"
3,swim cap,The swim cap is comfortable. I actually bought all 3 sizes to find the best fit. It does not keep my hair dry but keeps it tucked in. The strap broke the first time I used it. I just threw the strap away and the cap stays on without it.
2,Caps aren't what they used to be,This swim cap overs my head but it doesn't keep the water out! What's the point of a cap if my hair still gets wet?
4,swim cap review,"The swim cap is nice looking and stays on well. It is comfortable. However, it doesn't keep long hair totally dry. It is better than some others I have tried though."
1,swim cap,"I was happy with this swim cap at first. But after a few weeks, the snap tore away from the body of the cap. Wish I could get my money back."
4,Cake tastes good.,"I like Cake because they found their sound. All of the songs start with a scratchy guitar, the singer starts in (oh yeah... uh-huh....), there's a trumpet solo and the song ends. And it works for them. There's about three covers of other bands songs, which is a shame because Cake writes some good lyrics. But still, you can't help but the admire the unlikely pairing of Cake with Gloria Gaynor's ""I Will Survive."" As for Cake-written songs, there's three original songs about cars, ""Stickshifts and Safetybelts"" being strangely romantic.Cake sounds like an old 50's rock band, to me, at least. They keep up that sound until you come to ""Nugget"" where the lead singer swears at you relentlessly. This is a good record. There's nothing bad to point out, just that the songs don't get really great. They can reach a certain level and they just stay there. But it's fun place to stay."
5,One of cakes best,"This cd just has some kinda raw anger energy that is just great. Cake fans should be pleased as well as for new cake commers this is a good place to start....1. Frank Sinatra - 9.5 (classic song!!)2. The Distance - 9 (The one on the radio that is still great)3. Friend Is A Four Letter Word - 4 (some people like it, im not one of them)4. Open Book - 85. Daria - 96. Race Car Ya-Yas 9 (short, sweet, funny what more can you ask)7. I Will Survive - 10 (A awesome remake of a great song. One of my favorte cake songs of all time)8. Stickshifts And Safetybelts - 89. Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps - 410. It's Coming Down - 511. Nugget - 9 (Like shrapen knifes to chicken mcnuggets!)12. She'll Come Back To Me - 713. Italian Leather Sofa - 8.5 (very long for a cake song but very good)14. Sad Songs And Waltzes - 8.5(Doesnt sound like cake to me but good song)"
5,"not their best album, but CAKE can do no wrong","CAKE's best album is definitely Prolonging the Magic for the depth of sound and flow from track to track. I am a huge fan of their music, but for most casual fans, those into pop/rock/alt, this is the album for you. The Distance is the most popular song on the album by far. The 3 covers including I Will Survive are done so well you will think that CAKE wrote them themselves. I really don't know how CAKE can take such a variety of styles and make it their own, but they do one heck of a job. Frank Sinatra is my favorite song on the album, but all of them rule. Everyone should have at least one CAKE album in their collections."
4,Strong CD,"On each Cake CD there are always good catchy songs and bad, boring songs. ""Its Coming Down,"" ""Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps,"" and ""Daria"" are examples of good actchy ones. ""Race car ya yas,"" and ""Sad songs and waltzes"" are examples of bad boring ones. The rest of the tracks are good ones though that stay true to Cake's style and i recommend this Cd to anyone with an open mind."
3,Ahh Sweet Memories,This is nostalgia for me but to be objectively fair there's three great songs on this album all must haves even if you have to buy the whole album. Frank Sinatra is the real gem. Friend Is a Four Letter Word also good. Finally Stickshifts and Safety Belts will touch your soft spot. Checkem out.
4,Solid Cake,"Solid album. Its got some great songs on it, in fact is pretty much all great songs. For a Cake fan this is a must own. For someone who is not a Cake fan, well, buy it anyway, this will make you one."
2,DON'T BE FOOLED!,"I don't know what people are thinking -- this release is the pits compared to the ones that preceded and followed it. Any other group would be proud to have produced it, but I expected more from my men in Cake. None of its songs are nearly as memorable as those from Motorcade of Generosity. Hard-core fans, go ahead and pick it up -- real connoisseurs, skip it and save your money for the much more worthy Prolonging the Magic."
2,Boring for the most part,"I bought this cd for a couple of songs which are cool, the rest are below average. The group, like so many from the past to present, tries to hard to be anti-hip. They become just a bunch of clanging noise. But hey, they're going the distance...Oh wait, they tried and didn't make it."
5,Let us have Cake!,"New album kinda sucks, but this one is a classic! One of my favorite albums even counting the rest of what I own!"
5,So good,"Cake's ""Fashion Nugget"" is a great, laid-back rock record with a unique sound, clever lyrics, and a talented singer. This is the ideal soundtrack for kicking back on the porch with a cold beer on a Saturday afternoon."
5,CAKE,"obviously reviews are based on personal opinions, which this will just be my own--but i personally love CAKE. continuing the trend of their sound, this CD will make you feel right at home if you're familiar with any of their other work. Def reccomend."
5,CAKE- It's not just for dessert,"I've just discovered Cake and I've found it inventive. The norm for bands is to have the same basic ""sound"" throughout their CD's. So you hear one song and you've heard them all. To my amazement Cake has been able to pull off mixing and matching musical sounds and also adding entertaining lyrics. These Lackadaisical artists, who expect you to take they're music with a grain of salt and and a smile,bring music back to being entertaining. My faveorite pick from the album has to be the revival of ""I Will Survive"". Kudos to them for digging up a great song and giving it the 90's touch. Over all in my rateing scale of Shwanky-ness Cake gets top billing. So next time you kickn' back bust out the Cake, and enjoy!"
2,"Catchy, different, but will it stand the test of time?","This band deserves praise simply for daring to be different. The problem is, sometimes it sounds as if this group is trying too hard for that quirky appeal. Despite the eclectic sound (the meandering trumpet is an interesting addition, and actually works), this stuff is surprisingly accessible if you have ears that are attuned to late 90s alternative rock.""The Distance"" is an instant classic, and will be on all the compilation albums when this music is old enough to merit nostalgia. As for the rest of the CD . . . well, if you want to know what it will sound like in 20 years, try playing anything on ""Get the Knack"" besides ""My Sharona"": What were we thinking?"
1,TYPICAL 90's GARBAGE,"These guys have taken the 90s ""half singing-half talking"" style to a new level: Just Talking. It is so typical for 90s rock bands to feature a vocalist who simply cannot sing, and yet we accept it just fine. MTV has really done a number on America."
2,Yech!,"I bought this album for ""The Distance,"" an outstanding and mesmerizing song which is the only reason to give the album even two stars. Most of the other songs are awful. The lyrics are cold and repellent and the music forgettable. Don't waste your money unless you're a hard-core Cake fan."
1,"Sera, sera,sera...Fernando?","I'm wondering if Cake is giving credit to the authors of two Latino songs featured in Fashion Nugget. Half of the song ""Perhaps"" sounds exactly like ""Fernando"",a hit in Portuguese, sung by Perla about three decades ago in Brazil. The other half of ""Perhaps"" is of course Sera, Sera, Sera..which any Spanish speaking person is very familiar with. Makes you wonder whether the other beautiful songs in the album are ""creative collages"" as well..Who knows, who knows, who knows ??"
1,Wouldn't recommend,Does not taste good. I was expecting a taste similar to a mixed coffee blend that I had in Bali.
5,Ginseng Coffee,"I love this product, it tastes almost the same as the ginseng coffee you can find in Italy; I add milk instead of hot water and it's just perfect!!!"
5,Very cute!,"The diaper stacker matches the In Flight bedding set, and it is adorable! I am very happy with it. Be prepared for the tie straps on the sides as opposed to a hanger on top. If you have a solid crib, you may have to hang it somewhere else. Otherwise it is perfect!"
4,A Groom for Red Riding Hood,"When Mary Ellen Barnett found herself facing a church full of guests and no groom on the way, she did what every self-respecting woman would, she left town. Settling in the UP of Mi she took a waitressing job full of rowdy men. She encountered one who was handsome and gentle and her savior. He was a man who studied wolves and was in that region to take care of and study a endangered species and to eventually remove them into Yellowstone but he had to deal with a lair full of baby wolves whose mother had been killed. So he bottle fed them numerous times a day in the snow. She fell in love, she was leery since her fiance literally left her at the alter but she's overcoming her trust issues with this man -- her mate."
1,Did not work,"Neither of the the ink cartridges worked on my printer. I have replace hundreds of cartridges in the past w no problems. This was a waste of money. I ordered ""NEW"" and was sent ""REFILLED USED""."
1,Completely embarrassing to Hip-Hop,"Big surprise.First of all, this album sounds like everything else on the market right now.So normally I wouldn't even waste my time listening or writing a review.Then I came across an interview where J-Kwon admitted he didn't know who Raekwon was.Pitiful.Rappers like this little punk don't deserve to hold a microphone, much less make an album. He doesn't even know about the pioneers that came before him.Sad.I would recommend that nobody buy this album and stop supporting garbage music that is catered to 12-year-old girls, but I bet half of you don't know who Raekwon is either."
1,More cheese than Velvetta!,This cd is horrible!J Kwon can't rap and the first song he has on the radio he stole the opening lines from an old school hip hop song by THe D.O.C.He's not saying anything new that other mainstream aren't saying.Just put him in the pot of stew with the corny ass rappers.This cd blows!
3,"I love tipsy, but the album version is disappointing","I've been obsessed with the song Tipsy since I heard it on the radio last month and I have to say that I'm pretty disappointed with the CD version of the song because he says ""b*tch"" instead of ""club"". Now I'm not opposed to bad language, quite the contrary - I hate it when someone sends me the clean version when I've ordered the explicit version - but I just don't think the word ""b*tch"" sounds as good as ""club"" in the refrain. It just doesn't have the same power and the hook just isn't as strong as a result. It's frustrating to listen to. They could have at least included the radio version as well on this CD but they didn't. I guess I'll have to buy the CD single (or was that all a part of their plan? Hmmmm...)The rest of the album is pretty good if you like Nelly and the like. Personally I think rap peaked with Public Enemy, but there are still some gems on this joint."
2,TRASHY MUSIC,"I should of known what I was going to get when I bought this album. This is an example of pure trash. The only worthwhile song is the single ""Tipsy."" Other songs are pointless and are like every other song. ""Underwear"" ""Hoop Hop"" and ""Show Your Ass"" are songs that give me a headache just listening to them. Save your money and buy something else. This album does not need anyone's support."
1,"NELLY, CHINGY, J-KWON ALL THE SAME PERSON?","To start off I would like to say that this is the most unoriginal rap artist I have ever heard. The beats are weak for the most part, other than the single ""Tipsy."" But you will get sick of that song really fast because of the simplicity of the beat. He is only 17 so what does he know about getting ""Tipsy"" anyway, It only takes him 2 beers. St. Louis rappers are getting old with all of this HEERRRE and THURR crap and J-Kwon isn't helping matters. I suggest some rap from the real south."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CD I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS CD,Truthfully this album has 4 good songs I Burned it from the internet and I advise everyone else to burn it hood hop and ask me are the best songs the other ones is like DAMN WUT WERE U THINKIN
4,He has good beats,This is a very brilliant starting cd but definetely has a couple improvements. Alot of the songs are like Tipsy which is a good song and if you like that song you will like this one. The song IC IC with the St. Lunatics I thought could be better because i love the St. Lunatics and all they're work. These are definetely songs you listen to while you are driving and want some music to blast and to piss off people next to you.Definetely worth the money... which was $9.99 at media play openeing day and is $13.99 on here without shipping and handling... so go to the store and buy it!
1,THIS CD IS RAP AT ITS WORST!,"WHEN I BOUGHT THIS CD,IT WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT I WENT AND GOT THE MONEY BACK ON IT THE NEXT DAY.LISTEN,I DON`T KNOW WHY GOOD RAPPERS LIKE NELLY WOULD SIGN PEOPLE LIKE THIS TO A RECORD LABEL.IF YOU WANT BETTER RAP,I`D RECOMMEND SWEAT/SUIT AND THE DOCUMENTARY.THEY ARE BY PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY KNOW HOW TO RAP.PLUS,THEY ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT THEY`RE TALKING ABOUT."
1,Booy,Don't buy this CD I Listened to the Music Samples on Amazon and it's sad because I don't have that cd and I don't even like it.But if you only buying the CD Because of Tipsey Get It On A Mixed Cd.I Like Hip Hop And Rap and everything but this Cd is just talking about Hitting it.But if you wanna set the mood right yeah buy it but whatever.You can talk about me I don't care But DON'T BUY THIS CD!
1,The effect...,"Here is a conversation I heard at my school earlier this year. It demonstrates hip-hop's effect on the world:Kid 1: YO DAWG, DID YOU COP THE NEW J-KWON CD?Kid 2: AWW HELL YEAH DAWG, THATS GOT SOME PHAT A** BEATS ON IT!The sad part? These kids are white..."
3,J Kwon/Hood Hop,"J-Kwon's new album, Hood Hop is a good album, but there was alot of songs I didn't like. Here is a list of all the songs on this album that I like:""Tipsy""""Hood Hop""""IC IC""""Welcome To Tha Hood""""Show Me Your A**""""Morning Light""""My Enemies""""Underwear""Those are most of the songs on the album, so I guess it's pretty good."
4,4/5 Stars,"I think that J Kwon is pretty good for a beginer. His debut album, ""Hood Hop"" has some nice songs. I gave it a 4 because he sound a little bit weak on some tracks. The best songs are IC IC, Tipsy, and Welcome To The Hood. I think this album is good to buy, but because of some songs, you can't listen to the whole album without having to skip some tracks,"
1,Weakness,"This album is no good. I don know where to start, the beats are weak and annoying, n the flow is nonexistent. If i hear that ""Tipsy"" song one more time i will smash my TV or Radio. And why is this kid rappin bout being ""Tipsy"" when he cant even drink for 4 more years. This is the worst rapper ive heard in a long time. This is worthless crap. I give it one star n it dosent even deserve that."
3,dope album,"when i 1st listened i didn't really like it apart from tipsy(only because of its constant radio playing)and they ask me, but after a few listens the madness of the album came out. the best songs are tipsy,they ask me,me enemies,u aint gotta like me and you and me. there are only about two songs which i would give about 2-3 stars but apart from that well done j kwon on a tight album"
5,'Hood Hop' is tight,"J-Kwon's new album Hood Hop is tight as hell. He has tight beats, he sounds tight, and he has variety in his rhymes. He rhymes bout life in the hood, bout love, and alot are just bout having a good time. Yall should definitely cop this cd it's off the hook. You wouldn't believe that a 17 year old produced this album."
1,Annoying copy protection!,"Don't buy it! This CD makes you use a special program to listen to it on your computer. Also, you can't rip the files the way you want. You can only have secure WMA files. What a joke! Its pretty much a worthless CD because I can't listen to the music like I listen to all my other music ... through iTunes and on my portable audio player."
2,Not worth it,"Ok, Tipsy was a hot song. It was a big dance song, but every other song on this CD sucks. You and Me, J-Kwon's lastest single, is one of the worst song I ever heard. There are bad lyrics. Why the F*** does he talk about ice cream, as far as I know, I'm not even sure he is because his lyrics are so bad. Seriously, get something else worth your money. Not J-Kwon!P.S. I'm not a hater!"
1,WHAT!?!?!,"When I first heard Tipsy, for the first few seconds I thought it was hot and it was BUT the whole song is a HOOK. Sure its perfect for the clubs but for everyday listening NO.And did you hear his 3rd single, he's got the worst voice ever. He's singing the whole damn song when he has an RNB artist singing on the same track.IF YOU WANT REAL MUSIC GET THE LATEST FROM JADAKISS AND LIL WAYNE"
4,banging album,"how does st louie put out such great rappers. a great cd ever track is a banger. and plus the features on the cd are great, never seen a better enhanched cd that this, you can email the songs to your friends. but get this if u dont ur dumb."
2,"Tight Beats, Loose Rapper","The Hood Hop disc is aight. The beats are hot. TrackBoyz did a good job. But the rapper is horrible. Strictly horrible. And make it so bad, I am 22 years old, but I am a fan of lyrics and complete albums. He does NOT have it. IF you do not listen to lyrics, then it will be a god buy for you. If otherwise, stay away like AIDS.Top 3 Songs; Hood Hop, IC IC, TipsyBottom 3 Songs: The Rest"
4,"Great Work, Great Flow",Some of this album is a little on the weak side but all in all he has great flow and it is well recorded and produced make sure you buy this album cuz if not your gonna be the only one in the country without it. And wait for the future when this guy hits da top of da charts in every area!
4,I'm tired of yall hatin,Look...I feel like a few of the otha people that have left reviews...the ones that have said h0w can u review this cd if you haven't even listened to the whole damn cd?..this cd is nice and for him to only be 17 and be talkin' bout the shii he talk about is krayzie...i like the cd...i like the flows...maybe a few beats could have been better buh overall the cd is nice...not 5 stars buh 4 because there may be one or two sonGs i Go past on the cd...buh as far as GivinG him 1 or 2 stars I hiGhly doubt u even listened to the cd...-Ya Gurl Lady C
1,Horrible,"One of my friends always buys the latest rap release, and he gave this to me one day to listen to. So after wasting about 15 minutes on this pathetic album, I couldnt take it anymore. J-Kwon is a horrible rapper. His rhymes are really,really bad and all of the background music sounds pretty much the same on every ""song"". It is a mystery to me how anyone would give this loser a record deal, and even worse yet, release it to the public. Don't buy this trash."
2,This Cd is horrible Shad Representin T-town,"This Cd is horrible don't waste your money. I mean I understand he thinks he's the teen president but, his CD Sucks. There are only a couple of good songs thats it."
1,HOOD HOP??? NO......I DUNNO WHUT KIND OF JUNK THIZ IZ,THIZ IZ NOT HIP-HOP....or hood-hop....whuteva you wanna call it...thiz iz trash....pure junk....rap haz come to an end....practically all i hear iz pop or club muzik that makez me sick....i believe J-kwon or whut eva hiz name iz should be eliminated....my wish is that all theze fake rapperz and fake rap/hip-pop listenerz should go to a different planet full of dummiez and keep tha real rapperz and muzik listenerz in earth...cuz right now thiz world iz trash with crappy muzik...DONT WASTE YO MONEY ON THIZ BOZO....and dont buy other stupid senseless crap like 50 cent eminem chingy nelly fabolous lil jon junk
1,Absolute garbage,Tipsy and Hood Hop were decent but the rest of this crap is flat out horrible. This was one of the worst rap albums of last year and hopefully this dumbass won't make another album or will step his game up. XXX wasn't bad but this dude still is a horrible rapper and I don't recommend buying this trash at all. If you want a good mix of party and gangsta songs get 50 Cent's Massacre album instead or even Ja Rule's R.U.L.E. Those aren't classics but they are much better than this garbage.
4,I cracked the code,"the cd is good, but once you get protection down its all smooth copying from there.....if you wanna know the secret email arfbikes@hotmail.com. its a lot easier then you think!"
1,I Really Meant 0 stars,I would've given this 0 stars. This is the worst album I have ever heard. No wonder this guy is never coming back
1,weakest rapper in st. louis,"this is why pedople are hating the rap game and makes legends wannas retire cause of wack ass rappers like j kwon tipsy's okay for a club hit but the rerst of this cd sucks jd did better with kris kross, and bow wow and even bow wow's starting to suck now."
1,Wow,"This is NOT MUSIC. Its some guy talking overtop of synthesizers and drum machines. What he does takes no talent. Think about it: anybody could write 20 songs about being in clubs, women, guns, ""bling-bling"" and sing (you dont have to show off any vocal talent though) overtop of a processed track. Has this guy ever heard of ""originality""? Theres some good hip-hop out there, mainly the ones that don't do the same thing as everybody else (Eminem, Outkast), but this is complete MTV garbage. How many of these videos/songs that show the SAME EXACT THING (a rapper in ""bling-bling"", baggy clothes in a club with people dancing/partying, and half naked women dancing around) can stupid teenys actually buy without realizing ""this is all generic garbage""...? I heard some kid in my class today saying ""Yo did you cop J-Kwon's new album that s*** is hot"". Of course all the trendies responded ""OH YEAH THAT IS OFF THE HOOK""! The sad part? They were all 15-16 and white..."
1,is Jermaine Dupri really so sooooo def?,"Tipsy was good, n i did give the album a good listen!!!! i really thought this guy had somethin good in him....i really did try listen 2 these songs but there so bad!!anyone cood have done what he done.there are worse den him! n i kant believe that..."
1,TERRIBLE ALBUM!,"ID RATE THIS ALBUM ""0"" STARS, BUT THE LOWEST I CAN GIVE IT IS ONE. THE BEATS ARE UN-ORIGINAL, THE LYRICS ARE HORIBLE. THIS ALBUM WILL PROBABLY APPEAL TO 12 YEAR OLD GIRLS, SINCE THEY DONT HAVE ANY CLUE ABOUT TALENT ANYWAY.IF YOU WANT TO HEAR REAL RAP MUSIC, PRETTY MUCH POP IN ANYTHING FROM THE EARLY 80'S. AFRIKKA BAAMBAATTA AND THE SOUL SONIC FORCE, KOOL MO DEE, RUN DMC, BIG DADDY KANE ETC. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!"
1,Dark-X reveiws (J-Kwon - Tipsy),"Hey its Dark-X and I am warning you not to buy this. Vulgar and foul lyrics do not offend me, but this is just going overboard. Atleast 30 bad words or phrases in the song is just annoying. Albums like this only contain one good song and 2 songs that are semi-good. Those are not worth a purchase of a full album. Buy the single or download the song by paying 99 cents. Hood Hop, Tipsy, and They Ask Me are the good songs. Why pay $15 bucks on them when you can spend less on an Ipod download or the single. I am not one of those people who are unfair to rap music. I gave this a fair rating. I am a rap fan and I like good rap. Did you know J-Kwon got kicked out of his house at age 12. He probably kept rapping sucky rhymes until his mother got deaf.- Dark-X"
1,0 stars,Im not even goig to waste my time reviewing this or any more of my money buying anymore of his cd's
2,1 HIT WONDER!,"Tipsy was an amazing song with great beats, which i still enjoy to listen today. But thats about it. J-Kwon lyrically is a disaster. Better download tipsy or go here http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0001WPSKE/qid=1131228824/sr=2-2/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_2/002-8147782-2632834?v=glance&s;=musicI have no idea how this wack rapper got his record deal"
1,Garbage,Beware its utterly trash i dont even like the so called good songs its pathetic about as bad as chingyoh how i wish that Pac was still with us
1,What The F%#*!,"I can even begin to Describe how this Cd suxs so much, heres a True Story, i had stole 3 cd's from Best Buy, and Hood Hop was one of the 3, as i popped each CD into the CD player to listen to em, when i got to JKWONS cd, i was Miserable, and Guilt Kicked in, I was like ""damn I stole this B.S"" That cd sucked so much I later Returned it back to Best buy and apologized for what i did, and told the Service center i will Pay for the Damages, but i will not keep that CD, Its that sad, Im not a hater, but How did he get a deal? Jermaine Duprie Must be Really So So Deaf to let this ride,I wouldnt even Recomend you to illeagly Download this Crap,""IM NOT A HATER I JUST KNOW GOOD MUSIC"""
3,So/so,"I have to say that there is one thing J-kwon knows about teens, they do drink and party. His CD really sucks, its just a cd about gettin high, drunk, and havin sex with girls you meet at a parties. Now if you like to do those things this is a CD for you. All in all you should try it out for your self."
1,Not worth giving a LISTEN!!,"This CD is AWFUL!! It makes St.Louis...NO, Missouri look bad. They give record deals to ANYBODY. His voice is annoying! Somebody give this dude a cough drop! I give this CD 1 star, and that was just for ""Tipsy""! Even the interludes are stupid! Please, don't waste your time."
1,Someone bought this today?,"Suprised. I cant believe someone would buy this trash. He has no skills, he makes Lil' Romeo look like 2 Pac."
2,hood hop,I think j kwon is just like every other trl pop rapper. I heard the unedited version of tipsy and it is kind of good otherwise I would have given him only 1 star. Other from that I think he is too generic and he's not original. The song tipsy is half way decent but the video isn't. Im just tired of seeing the same concepts in videos and no creativity. I've heard 1 or 2 other songs from the album and trust me you shouldn't waste your money on it.
1,same old thing...,"why do all kids these days insist on listening to this rap garbage?! it's all the same. every song is the exact beat and theme as the other one. sure rap was original and fun when it came out, but after the same song is repeated 1,000 times in a row it tends to get a little old. what is with all these rappers pretending to be gangstas and stuff.. does everyone have to be a thug to have talent? seriously, modern music has plummeted to the next level. i reccomend real music like jimi hendrix, the beatles, grateful dead, bob dylan, pink floyd, just to name a few."
1,Uselessness epitomized,This type of hip-hop and variations thereof (J-Kwon is not the only artist guilty of this travesty) is a waste of the producers' and their representative companies' time. There is little to no musical talent involved in creating these acoustic abortions promoted as songs. The world of rap should be ashamed of itself. Tupac and various other artists who were the arhcitects of this movement are rolling over in their graves (a place they would not be if it were not for the ridiculous feuds started between them over mindless crap). But I digress....J-Kwon and his album have sapped my remaining faith in the industry and humanity in general. Enjoy!
3,Good but poppy,jkwon is the only good pop rapper some good club trax here overall a decent cd much better than fabolous or ja rule
1,Pure crap!!!!!!!!!!,"This album sux beyond anything I could think of, Rap sux and it will always suck! Hip hop will soon meet it's fate like Disco, Techno, and New Wave. Rock will live on till the end of time and thats the truth!!!!!!"
2,good performances but HORRIBLE sound quality - skip it!!,"When I saw this double CD set in the store I slapped down the money and brought it home. I love anything Ella sings but I was disappointed in this set. It's not Ella's fault. Ella's performances are always good. My gripe here is the sound. Flat, hollow and cheap come to mind. It sounds like they played the vinyl and recorded it and then slapped it on a CD. It's awful. And the worst part is that had I not also bought the ""Something to Live For"" double CD set, I'd think that the songs here were presented in the best possible quality. ""Stairway to the Stars"" and ""How High the Moon"" are in good quality on STLF. They are the same studio recordings. STLF is superb by the way, pick that one up instead. Now I'd like to hear a good sounding ""That Old Black Magic"" and ""When I Get Low I Get High."""
2,Misleading appearance,"I purchased these a few days ago. I was not impressed. The colour is not as white as it looks on the photo. It's more of an off white colour as though its been washed a few times. The material was also off putting, similar to track suit material. I much prefer the pro stretch range."
4,Hip Fossils,"With the activity of band splits, new bands, and different musical directions, Ian and company have made a definite mark in indie and pop land. ""Evergreen"" brings back the sensibility of great melodies, hooks and lucious lyrics while pleasing most of the bunny fans who were distraught with my first sentence. The songs here are quickly accessible, and have Ian crooning just at the right time as well as Will spiralling with the right string. I think they had to do this very good formula album to get back in a room together. Maybe the future will unleash once again the magic of yesterday but with todays surprises. Old bunny fans will never be quite happy enough with Echo since the porcupine and croc days were special ones. They can never be that again."
3,"Not Their Best, Not Bad Though","This is the latest offering from one of the best bands of the 80s. Though Ian McCullough's soaring vocals and Will Seargent's amazing guitar are still here, the spark is diminished some. It looks as if Echo has taken too many pages fromt he Brit-Pop songbook. Still, there are some great moments here. If you're a long time fan, pick this up. If you're a newcomer to this amazing band however, go for one of thier ealier works and hear this band in their prime."
3,"Eh, not bad I suppose","I've been listening to the Bunnymen for many years now, and I was thrilled to hear that they were re-forming, but I must say that (*sigh*) it's just not the same without Pete DeFreitas. This is a pretty good album, but does not have anything close to the stuff of their early eighties albums. As a matter of fact, I actually like the Electrafixion (Ian McCulloch and Will Sergeant) album quite a bit better than this one, but that's really more a testament to the brilliance of the former than the shortcomings of the latter."
2,A real letdown,"Very disappointed, a very boring album. Extremely lame (and I'm a huge fan of the band.)"
1,Pete DeFretais Is dead,How can you write a review and not know who is in this band?Pete DeFretais is dead he died right after they broke up the first time..................................
3,Brilliant in spots,"I'm a long-time Bunnymen fan, so when this comeback CD was released after a ten-year breakup I didn't expect it to knock me out, and it didn't. ""I'll Fly Tonight"" is fairly lame. However, the title track and ""Don't Let It Get You Down"" are instant Bunnymen classics and completely worthy of inclusion in their canon of brilliant, romantic pop epics. In an era in which we are continually assaulted with the miserable sounds of cheapened commercial alterna-product, it nearly brought me to tears to hear Will's guitar and Ian's voice together again. These guys are two of the most original and inventive musicians in modern pop. The Bunnymen broke up long before they had run out of ideas. It's nice to have them back and making music again, even if it doesn't quite approach the brilliance of the first four albums."
2,Rather Disappointing,"I remember getting quite excited when this CD came out - wow, new Echo (well, new Bunnymen, anyway). The band plays well, the music is fine - but Ian sings with sort of a bored/satisfied feel on almost every song. Even an excellently written song like ""Nothing Lasts Forever"" is marred by what sounds like disinterest on his part. When he finally opens up (""Altamont""), the results are much more satisfying. Nothing really horrible about this CD, but nothing worth getting excited about, either."
2,What happened to your voice Ian?,"I really liked Echo And The Bunnymen in the 80's. My hopes were high when I learned about Ian rejoining, but after repeated playings that often induced sleep, I found those hopes dashed.Ian's voice seems to have lost it's upper register, leaving him to sing in a low drone as if he's been on valium for years.Frankly, I'm at a loss to explain the 4 and 5 star reviews here.This doesn't even hint at past greatness such as ""Crocodiles"" and ""Ocean Rain"". The fact that there are currently 30 used copies available here speaks in volumes."
3,could be worse...,"This is an okay album, but there's no way it can compare with classic Bunnymen. It's just so...mellow. Don't get me wrong; some classic B-men songs, like Ocean Rain and Bring on the Dancing Horses, were quite subdued, but here it's just too much, and there's nothing to balance it. At no point on this album does Mac even raise his voice. Most of the songs are okay, and there are a few classics (Evergreen, Just a Touch Away), but all in all they sound sorta washed out. Let's hope the decidedly un-Bunnily-titled (great word, eh?) What Are You Going To Do With Your Life? is better.One last comment: what's with the ""God's above us/Jesus loves us"" bit in Don't Let It Get You Down. Argh! I'd always assumed Mac was a good pagan, and now I'm disillusioned! Oh well..."
1,not recommended,"I bought this binder to file my recipe.However, it only lasted about 6months, and I had to replace to another one."
3,Patent leather,"Just to make it clear, the picture looks like regular leather, but it is actually shiney patent leather. The written description does state that but I missed it and didn't care for it. It otherwise appears as represented and the return was pretty easy."
1,I didnt listen to other reviewers... my bad,pro - it is cutecon - the metal heats up and the temp is ALWAY 80oFa waste of money
1,Scenery Chewing,"I wish I'd researched this film before I bought it. While the story idea is fascinating...something weird is going on with the people in a sleepy little English village surrounded by a megalithic stone circle, it turns out to be the most over-the-top, over-acted, dated movie I've seen in many years. There's a reason film-making has advanced beyond this. It is also accompanied by the most melodramatic, annoying sound-track ever. This one should be put in the archives and left there."
4,Good for me,"These just work for me, they keep me going with energy all day plus I don't stop and pick at food, not hungryat all but I do have to take a break from them after a week I'll take 2 or 3 days off cause I can still feel it in my systemthen I'll get right back on then again."
2,Your Marriage Can Survive a Newborn,I bought this book looking for some helpful advice for when our first son arrived. I did not find it with this book. This book is just a couple's stories about life with their first. Somewhat interesting but not at all what I was looking for.
2,get a first edition,This is a really good book for anyone interested in building model rockets. I only give it two stars because the first edition is better. The second edition deletes information and replaces it with buy our software.
1,Typos and then some,"My single star has nothing to do with Ambler's novel but everything to do with this edition of it, which could drive you as nuts as it drove me. How? It was poorly proofread; consequently, the text is swimming in typos. I'm slinging my copy and buying another edition."
3,Its Not a Binder,"it should be a blade for meat grinder, not a binder.Or it use to be blade now its a binder."
3,Low Quality,Bent within the first 24 hours of use. A little unsightly but still usable. But I would seriously rather have a more sturdy binder.
3,Good basic binder,"This is an ok binder, not the best quality. Lasted me less than a year, I use it for my coupons and the inside pocket split at the seam less than 6 months after purchase. Then I was in the grocery store one day and knocked the binder off the counter, it split the binder at the spine seam. Bummer! I have purchased another one with a reinforced spine."
3,Good binder,"Not great, but very standard binder. I bought in bulk and use them as logbook housings for my basic open water SCUBA students."
2,"sorry, for me this lacks luster.","I like getting art mags to see what is the trend in the art world how to keep my work current & diverse & just enjoy really great work. FOR ME... this mag does not deliver. Little to no variation, not one painting I found to be really memorable, I will not get it again. You might want to go to an art store/ the library & look for your self before sinking any money into this one."
4,floyd is underrated,"A lot of my musician friends tend to laugh a little when i say that Floyd Cramer is cool. But he is, and this sweet little gospel record is ample proof. He plays the songs straight, allowing their simple beauty to shine through, uncluttered. It is especially nice to hear him solo, without a band or fancy arrangements."
5,Well written with excellent maps!,"As a novice to the English Civil War I found this book very easy toread & grasp. I really appreciated the military situation maps listedby year, it helped put the battles & campaigns into a logical framework.Buying this book is money well spent!"
2,all is great but the sheet,"I loved this pattern it's adorable and my son just loves the mobile... he smiles everytime I lay him in his crib to sleep. However, the sheet in the set is very cheap. It ripped on me the first time I tried to put it on. I bought a new one and it's lasted, but it's already tearing from washing it. I suggest to get another solid color sheet & it'll look great. Too bad, because the sheet is just adorable."
3,Shrinking is a problem,"It's gorgeous and does go wonderfully with the set. But after washing, they did shrink and would not go back on the mattress very easily. Unfortunatley, one did rip and I am unsure if I want to replace it with another one, or just buy a solid colored sheet."
2,Does not wear well after washing,I love this bedding except for the crib sheet. They shrink and rip very easily when putting them back on the mattress. I would suggest buying solid sheets to match the set for a cheaper price!
2,"Cute, but over-priced.","This is the same sheet you get with the 4 piece bedding set. It's cute and matches perfectly, but I think $20 for one fitted sheet is over-priced. We bought a plain, beige sheet for $7 to use as a spare and it looks just as good as this one with the bedding set!"
2,"Some good things, but...","Not one of the best books I've read on the topic of anxiety. It seemed as though much of the book's focus was on peddling the merits of Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy rather than providing workable strategies to assist in the treatment of anxiety. I found the writing to be disengaging with the inclusion of some unusual case studies which did nothing to enhance the quality of the book. I would instead recommend When Anxiety Attacks: The New, Drug-Free Anxiety Therapy That Can Change Your Life by David Burns, a far more practical and user-friendly book."
3,Okay but read his books....,"Maybe it's me but I prefer to read Dr. Ellis' books to the tapes. The tapes just don't seem to have the impact,at least for me.This one went on and on about some guy's sex life and learning how to come correctly. I'm not a prude but I would hesitate to loan this to my mother or someone not as comfortable with blunt sexual language.Still I have a great deal of respect for REBT and like the books."
2,"What a blowhard, self promoting jerk","This book was recommended by my psychologist and I am completely disappointed. In the book, the author basically says since he overcame anxiety then anyone can and that's all there is to it. He doesn't address the whys or whats of having anxiety only his experiences. Most of his anxiety came from public speaking or from approaching women. So his solution is to keep making yourself do the things that make you have anxiety over and over and over again until you don't have anxiety anymore. What a useless joke! This book totally dehumanizes a person and tries to reprogram someone as an unemotional robot. I gave it 2 stars because one case example of a music teacher was amusing so I got a good laugh. Other than that everything he does in this book is to self promote what a great person he is and how wonderful he is at everything he does."
3,Great information,"I do so love the wealth of information I get from Dr. Ellis' books. However, an entertaining writer he is not. The information in this book is very good but often presented with a very dry delivery and is occasionally repetitive. This would not be a book I simply throw at my clients and ask them to read. They would be asleep in the first 5 pages.So in summary, I think the content and the purpose of the book is wonderful. Just a poor presentation."
4,Good introductory biography of an important American,"A&E's Biography Series has produced many wonderful video portraits. Their biography of Thomas Jefferson is no exception. Within the video's 50 minutes, it covers all of the major events and accomplishments of Jefferson's long life (83 years) and gives a look into some of his private life as well."
5,TAKES YOU UP CLOSES WITH THE GANGSTERS,"READ THIS BOOK THE FIRST TIME BACK IN 1983-84. SINCE THE I HAVE READ IT EVERY 3 TO 4 YEARS, ITS THAT GOOD. MAKES YOU FEEL AS IF YOU KNEW JIMMY PERSONALLY. OVID DEMARIS DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB."
5,Amazing replica of the USS Enterprise-A,There has not been a more successfull replica of a Starship since Plamate's USS Enterprise-D. This remarkably detailed and beautiful toy captures the look and feel of the USS Enterprise A. When I look at this toy I feel like I am looking at the actual model used for the movies. Credit to Art Asylum for successfully recreating one of the most favorite Starships in Star Trek History
2,Not nearly as detailed as some pictures would indicate.,"If you expect this model to match the pictures of it in Star Trek Communicator Magazine you will be very disappointed. If you compare the two you will see that the one in the magazine was obviously touched up with more detail. What you actually g et is decent but it's not like the one in the magazines. It does however match the picture that Amazon provides pretty well. It is best viewed from a distance,, I'll put it that way. There is a visible seam where the struts of the nacelles attach to the main engineering hull in particular. If you attach the base AFTER the base mounting hull plate is attached as they say to do you risk damaging the model. Best to attach the base to the mounting plate first then screw it on. Sounds are cute.. Mainly it just isn't nearly as finished as I would have hoped."
5,Awesome Toy & Collectible,"This is the Enterprise-A from the 4th, 5th and 6th Star Trek movies. The ship is 16"" long, and very highly detailed. It's pretty durable for a small toy with thin plastic pieces. Art Asylum makes great ships, the first being the NX-01 from the TV show ""Enterprise."" Although I would have liked a bit more detail (especially more paint on the bottom of the saucer), it's still one of the best Trek ships ever produced (Playmates made horrible Trek ships compared to Art Asylum). I was very happy with this ship, and for the price, it's definitely worth it. Highly recommended."
5,"Nice product, poor quality and support from A.A.","The ships design and detail is very good. Yet Art Asylum still wants to design the nacelles as a separate part from the ship. This produces poorly fitting nacelles and sometimes the metal contacts inside them do not meet with the ship, thus they dont work! They NX model suffers from the same problem.The stand it comes with is nice, but trying to attach the base to the bottom of the ship is very difficult. I was sure I would have snapped the stand attachment ball in two if I was not more careful.Support from Art Asylum is horrible & they would not take my call regarding the issue of the warp nacelle. Too bad, they should be supporting their products much much better."
4,"So good, you could tell people you built it!!!!!","Good quality model. The paint job is good, and the attention to detail is great!!!! The sound effects are good I guess, if your 8 years old, but I didn't buy it for that anyway. The only questionable item is the stand....It could have been made better. Bottom line is, its worth the money. (especially if you can't build a model!!!)"
5,Art Asylum USS ENTERPRISE NCC-1701-A,"This 16"" enterprise ship is my very first star trek toy which i've just bought it on 4 October 2003. It is very impressive and enjoyable to me. It's a must star trek ship for collectors."
4,Finally,"I have been waiting for a model of the 1701A to come out for a long time. Not being much of a model maker has relegated me to buying products like this. If you are like me this ""toy"" is perfect for you. Great to keep on a desk or if your younger then play away. The ship is realistic and a great edition to any collection."
4,HANDLE A BIT LARGE,"I LOVE WUSTHOF KNIVES! THIS KNIFE HAS A FIRM, STURDY BLADE, SHARP OUT OF THE PACKAGE, SEEMS TO BE WELL BALANCED. HAVING ARTHRITIC HANDS, I AM CONCERNED THAT LOTS OF CHOPPING MIGHT BE TIRING BECAUSE OF THE LARGE GRIP OF THE HANDLE. I HAVE MEDIUM-SIZED HANDS, SIZE 7-1/2 GLOVE. HOWEVER, I LOOK FORWARD TO USING THIS SHARP BLADE."
1,Did not work,Computer with Vista could not see HP5100c scanner through this cable. Computer with XP went to blue screen when scanner was installed with this cable. Same computer with XP operated the scanner through a serial cable.
5,Keep Using That Old Laserjet,"I purchased this patch cable to use with my very, very old HP Laserjet printer (15+ years). I opened the package, plugged one end into a USB port on my recently purchased laptop, and the other end into my old Laserjet. Without installing any drivers, I was able to print. WOW! It couldn't have been any easier..."
2,Not Compatible,I purchased this cable to connect my scanner to my new motherboard which no longer had a 25 pin socket.Unfortunately it did not work. The computer does not recognise the scanner when I plug it into any of the USB ports on my hard drive.
1,Doesn't fit Dell 1700 printer,Had to return this cable as it did not provide a male connector which fit my Dell 1700 printer. See my review of the Sabrant cable which did fit.
1,didn't work,I need one the I can connect to my old computer printer port that need the male to connect to my female port. this one wasn't the right type...I have to have one with the male prones
1,The USB to Printer cable DOES NOT EMULATE A PRINTER,The product does not emulate a printer. There are many users on different sites complaining about the anomaly and unable to resolve it.Vendor should provide proper support or remove the product form the market!
1,Don't buy this,waste of money. It didn't work when I connected with my old Zip drive. I would not recommend this to anyone.
2,Does not work,Have a HP 722c. Tried cable on Xp and Win 7. Said printer was ready. When I went to print nothing happen. It said to restart computer or reset printer spool. I did both. Any suggestions?
3,Printing Would Work,"This product worked just fine and came with drivers and everything it needed. The only thing is that I was planing to use this parallel port to run relays, but the problem is that Windows will only recognize this as a printer port and can not control the pins individually. Windows will only see this as a printer, therefore do not buy this product unless it will be used only for a parallel printer."
3,Good text on Thailand,"I read this book for a class I took in college on Western influence in non-Western countries. I chose Thailand because it is the only nation in east Asia that has never been conquered by a European nation. I chose this book to read about Thailand because it gives a concise but comprehensive look at Thailand's history starting from aboriginal times to the modern day; post Cold War. The book also addresses the role Buddhism has played in this country's history. This book is easy to read, and worth reading. I learned many things from it, including the fact that the percentage of Thai women engaged in prostitution is less than most of its neighbors. It just happens that it is legal in Thailand, hence the international reknown."
3,Like the conditioner! Hate the Shampoo!!!,"My husband and I purchased the shampoo and conditioner together from BJ's. I have hated using the shampoo! I honestly have used many products but this shampoo has been the worste! It leaved my hair so dry, stiff and hard! The conditioner smells so great and feels so nice, but is not a good detangler at all. I have to comb it in very small sections! If you are looking for something to detangle your hair...RUN! I now am using the rest of whats left in the conditioner bottle on my two yorkie dogs. The conditioner works great after I give them a bath. Please stay away from the shampoo! The shampoo is awful and I wouldnt even use it on my dogs!"
2,Awful,"I bought this conditioner because it smelled awesome. That is about the only redeeming quality about the product. I have used hotel conditioners that made my hair less tangled and softer than Organix Passion Fruit Guava conditioner. After using slightly less than a palm sized amount of conditioner (a lot, I know), my hair still feels like it was sucked up and tangled by a vacuum. I don't typically use that much conditioner, but it's necessary with this brand.I would have given it 1 star, but like I said, I like the smell. Everything else sucks.Edit - Oct. 20, 2011After using the conditioner for about two weeks, I noticed another downfall. My hands are very sensitive, and the conditioner actually makes my hands itch. Perhaps I should've known since it's so fragrant that it might irritate my hands. Beware if you have sensitive skin!"
2,Really Wanted to Like This,"I purchased this because I love the bottle and it smells great.It does get two stars for smelling great and the packaging, but it doesn't really condition my hair what-so-ever. I have color-treated, long, coarse hair. First of all, I feel like I need to use about 1/5 the bottle each time to actually get it to work through my hair. Then, after I rinse it out, I think it actually tangles my hair more--I spend a good 10 minutes combing tangles out of my hair every time I wash it, which isn't usually how I like to spend my mornings. I feel the hairs breaking because of all these knots, even though I try to be careful, and it really makes me angry.Buy this if you want your hair to smell good--but if you want it conditioned, and easy to comb, looking to something else instead. I prefer Herbal Essences over this for conditioning."
4,very impressed!,"I have thick, coarse hair that looks great until I step out into the humidity. This conditioner greatly improves the ease of straightening my hair and makes it incredibly soft. If I don't straighten my hair after using the conditioner, it makes it smooth and is acceptable to use when just air drying. I feel like I use a lot more of this conditioner than I do others, but this doesn't bother me because I can feel it absorbing into my hair rather than just sitting on top of it. This is not some miracle humidity buster, though. My hair still frizzes more than i would like it to, but these are the best results I've gotten thus far. On another note, I would buy this product at Walgreens or Target, because it's about the same price and you don't have to worry about shipping. I recommend this product!"
1,"Dry, frizzy hair ahead","This is THE WORST shampoo/conditioner ever. I have used this for about 2 weeks, and have not ever had hair this bad. I just. wanted something that smelled like coconut. It feels like I have wax in my hair while I am washing it, and my ends are so frizzy. Seriously, SUAVE, yes SUAVE, the 99 cent stuff is better for your hair. I am just going to buy some coconut essential oil and add it to my old shampoo and conditioner. PS, THE KERATIN IS JUST AS BAD!"
1,made my hair start falling out,"I bought this because it smelled so good but after using it my hair was not soft but I decided I'd use the rest as not to waste it. After a few weeks more hair than usual started coming out when I brushed it and it kept getting worse, I threw the rest away and went to a different brand, after a month it was back to normal. Two years later I smelled the pomogranate one and thought o maybe it was a fluke and tried it again but the same thing happened again. I am currently using the rest to shave my legs, I don't mind losing that hair."
1,First time returning a conditioner!,"I bought both the shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo was fine but the conditioner was awful! I thought the product was defective because it was like water with little pieces of white cream in it. My hair felt awful afterwards...stawlike and dry, even hard to get a comb through it! I am returning this product today... first time I ever returned a hair conditioner! Couldn't give no stars, but if had the option this is the product that deserves it."
2,okay,Not as good as I expected. I didn't feel like my hair was any more moisturized than when I used the conditioner I usually use. Not worth the extra money.
2,The only good thing about this conditioner is the smell :(,"This smells delicious, and I admit that's why I bought it in the first place. Unfortunately it doesn't really seem to condition at all and just sort of coats the top layer of my hair. It definitely doesn't help with tangles - if anything, it makes them worse.I do color my hair, but not sure why that should make a difference in how the product works (it should at least condition a LITTLE). But the smell is so great that lately I have been using a different conditioner, then using a little bit of this on the ends of my hair, just for the scent! But overall it's a disappointing product..."
2,Disappointing,"I really wanted to love this product. Based on the information I read it seemed perfect. I bought the Coconut shampoo and conditioner and was very disappointed. I have fine, heavily colored hair. The shampoo made my hair hard and straw like. The conditioner was more moisturising but I still had to put in a lot of leave in moisturiser afterwards to compensate for all the flyaway dryness this product caused. Maybe on other hairtypes it would be good but if you have hair like mine, then I would not recommend it. I will say that the fragrance was fantastic and that is the only reason I gave any stars."
3,Made my hair like straw!,"I saw this in my local Target store and they had a try me now for free, special. So I decided, what the heck. I have thick, wavy long hair and it tends to be dry. I tried this in the shower and loved the smell of rich coconuts and assumed the coconut milk will nourish and moisturize my hair..WRONG! My hair came out like straw! I could barely comb through it and after I styled it, my hair was dry looking and frizzy. The scent is great but the product itself is terrible. I had hair that smelled and looked like a coconut husk! Also the cust svc for this product is the worst! I tried to get my so called ""free"" rebate, which is my money back. I sent the info to them in Feb and now in May almost June, still NO money. I called the cust svc line and got a woman from India who had NO clue what was going on and basically said, I have no answers, and hung up on me! I guess I can kiss that money good bye!"
1,Terrible,"I tried this conditioner and it was the worst I have ever tried. It does not make your soft at all, had problems getting a comb thru my hair. My daughter tried and she hated it also. It does nothing for your hair."
2,"Smells great, but leaves hair DRY","I bought this product at a local retailer because of a free rebate coupon. It smelled awesome - my only reason for not giving it a lower rating. However, it makes my hair dry and hard to comb through. I've never had that problem with any other brands. Nice try for the organic, but didn't work for me."
1,"If you have long, thick hair...","...this isn't the conditioner for you. It rinses clean but does nothing for detangling, and when you have long, thick hair, detangling is job #1 for a conditioner, at least for me. I have yet to try the other ""flavors"" so hopefully one of the others will work, like the coconut one, I have high hopes for that one."
1,Blech!,"I also got this product at Target because of the ""Try it for free"" offer. The conditioner was awful, made my hair extremely dry. So I sent in the offer to get my money back, and after two phone calls to them and several months, they still have not sent the refund. Needless to say, not trying this brand again."
1,Don't Buy!,"I really wanted to switch to a more organic shampoo and conditioner. I thought these would be better for my hair. This is not the case for the Organix brand of these products. The shampoo did not lather and the conditioner did nothing for my hair. My hair was left dry, brittle, dull, tangled, and difficult to manage. This has to be the worst shampoo and conditioner I have ever tried. Do not buy these products!"
5,Great!,"This is an awesome collection of products. First, they smell delicious. Second, these are the only products I've used that I can tell a big difference in how my hair looks and feels after I use them. I use the shampoo, conditioner, and the clear serum."
2,If your buying this for scalp itch...dont waste your money,"If your buying it because it is organic, ok....but dont expect any miricles for scalp itch...for what it is SUPPOSED to be treat. Helped me 0 with that...I ended up getting relief from Demorex extra strength. Good luck. I have MAJOR scalp itch problems."
3,Not a good detangler,"This conditioner is very light and clean, however it is not meant for long, thick hair. I could barely comb through my hair after showering. It has a pleasant minty-chocolate smell though and left my scalp feeling fresh."
5,"wow, smooth shiny hair","i love keratin treatments but not the damage or flat hair. one use of this and the shampoo and my hair is smooth, silky straight, no frizz, plenty of body. the original keratin salon treatment is long gone. i have to fill my very porous hair by coloring it. with that and the flat ironing, my ends were beyond dry and split. they were completely unmanageable. i read the reviews, washed and used conditioner and left a little on the ends without rinsing. blow dried and ironed and my hair is lovely shiny, smooth, no frizz, no frazzled ends, but it has a nice body. was fast to dry and style, just like after the keratin treatment. not pin straight flat, but nice. actually the way i want it: mostly straight and not flat,no friz and lotsa shine. will buy their other styling products. :) btw, after the salon keratin treatment, my hair has not grown in two years: lots of breakage so was not worth it for me to ever repeat as i want to grow out my hair."
3,"Eh, I miss sulfates a bit.","Several months ago I gently weaned myself off my usual shampoo/conditioner (Biolage) and began looking for alternatives. Sulfate free products are generally a hit or miss for me, and this one is just so-so. Like most sulfate free products, the conditioner isn't what you might be used to. The back of the bottle says ""apply generously"" and honey, they aren't kidding. If I didn't really slather it on, my hair was frizzy. (Prior to this I was using a different brand of sulfate free shampoo, slightly more expensive. And I had a similar issue with the conditioner.)On another note, the shampoo with this type lathers very well, which threw me for a loop. All the other sulfate-free shampoos I've used were a pain to lather... Or maybe I'm just getting used to it. Who knows.Overall I plan to give Organix at least a month for my hair to get used to it. If it doesn't work, I'll move on to something else."
1,Very Drying,"HAIR TYPE: long/thick/wavy/somewhat unrulyPROS: pleasantly fragrant; inexpensive; easy to find in drug storeCONS: the conditioner, plus the oil, did not do anything for my hair as promised by the labels in the front and back of the bottle. My hair was really dry and coarse. I can't imagine what the outcome would have been had I solely used the conditioner without the oil. I was so looking forward to using this product but after one try, I immediately returned it. There are many positive reviews and I think that, overall, it works for a lot of women but some, like me, get no benefit from it :("
1,"Sulfate Free, but striped brazilian keratin from my hair!","This smelled ""ok"" I guess. Thats all I can say that is positive. It literally stripped the keratin treatment from my hair, which ironically is WHY i bought this product in the first place. So much for cheap being ""good""....Would NOT recommend as a product to use to lengthen the time a keratin therapy will last.Works OK as a body wash, although it lacks a nice aroma..."
5,"Great price, great product!","I am very particular about haircare products because of the extensive damage I've done through years of coloring, blow drying, and flat ironing. Last month, I stopped using conditioner because I could not find one that wouldn't make my fine hair limp and greasy. Because I love the smell of coconuts so much, I bought this product as a last ditch effort to find a conditioner that works with my hairtype. I am SO glad I did! The smell, the ingredients, the packaging and the price are absolutely spot on with this product! I would recommend it to anyone!"
2,Avoid!,"I really wanted to love Organix's Brazilian Keratin Therapy line. The bottles are so pretty and the conditioner smells sooo good. Plus, it's cheap! However, IT DOESN'T WORK! It only made my hair worse! It did nothing to condition my hair, it just coated it and made it feel heavy and waxy. It made it more coarse and tangly (exactly the opposite of the silky, smooth results I desired). I had to do a deep clarifying treatment to get my hair to feel normal again. It seriously just messed up the texture of my hair and i'm bummed I wasted my money on it."
2,skip the cherry blossom conditioner,"This Cherry Blossom shampoo and conditioner smell amazing and that was my reason for purchasing the set. The scent lasts a few hours and then fades, which is sad. The shampoo lathers more than other Organix products I've purchased before. I noticed my hair felt like it had been stripped by harsh cleansers after rinsing the shampoo. From roots to tips, it was squeaky and felt raw. The matching conditioner was no more impressive. The first time I used it, the bottom 3-4 inches of my hair felt stiff even after using styling products. On the second try, I conditioned twice for 3-5 minutes each time. The result was only slightly better but who wants a rinse-and-repeat conditioner. One pro: my hair has more volume at the roots."
1,Awful -Wish I could give it 0 stars,"I have very oily skin/hair. I am a Caucasian 25 year old female.This dried my hair out so badly. I used the shampoo & conditioner together, & then yelped as I threw $20 in the trash after 2 more uses.After my 3rd & final use, I knew I couldn't put my hair through any more. It strips your hair of all moisture like hair stripper!!!These products are NOT organic. What a cheap marketing ploy by giving it the name Organix.It smells amazing, but not worth having a head of straw.Very disappointed."
5,Awesome product,I do not agree with any of the bad reviews of this product. I have been using this conditioner with the shampoo and absolutely love it! My hair is very soft and smooth and my hair smells great. I let my condition sit for anywhere from 10-20 minutes on my hair and only wash my hair every 3 or 4 days. I also do not use a towel to dry my hair but instead I use a t-shirt to help it keep the moisture in my hair and have been doing that for over 10 years. I do tend to alternate my shampoos and conidtioners and this makes a big difference also because after a while my hair gets used to whatever products I use and I dont get the same effect.
5,Terrific,Excellent Conditioner. I use it with a cheap Garnier Fructose shampoo and it has made my frizzball hair very manageable. My hair is in great shape since I started using this stuff. Highly recommended.
2,"Smells great, but doesn't condition","This stuff smells so good I want to eat it. Unfortunately it doesn't condition at all. I have long, straight, thick hair that is highlighted (not dyed) and this stuff just doesn't ""cut it."" It left my hair feeling dry and very difficult to comb through (even though I comb my hair before I shower!) My hair is a tangled mess when I use this stuff, and I have the same results with all the conditioners in this line. I ended up giving the two bottles I had away. :( Waste of money.Honestly I don't know why anyone would put mint in any beauty products. If you have ever gotten peppermint oil on your skin you know what I mean! It dries your skin out and makes it burn!"
2,thumbs down,"this product smells amazing, and thats about it. it did not leave my hair soft and smooth, it left it dry and tangled. My hair is long, and has waves and curls, but easy to manage. I was very unimpressed with this product and will not buy it again."
1,"Not ""smoothing"" at all","I love the idea of organic hair products, recycled packaging and earth-friendly inks, but this conditioner is AWFUL. I have long, fine to normal hair. I usually apply conditioner, let it sit, then comb out with a wide-toothed comb before rinsing out, but the Shea Butter conditioner just made my hair feel like straw (while in my hair!) and created such a tangled mess, I was combing out chunks of hair. Horrible. Basically, all it did was scent my hair (which was yummy), but I ended up having to use another conditioner just to untangle the mess without ripping out more of my hair.I like Organix shampoo, but the conditioners are not impressive at all."
1,worst conditioner ever,"This conditioner is absoultely terrible. I would think that keratin products would be more effective than any others because keratin is so well known for the positive things that it can do to hair, this was awful though. After using it my hair was not smooth at all-- i had to use an excessive amount of leave in conditioner after the shower to be able to start brushing through the knots. I ripped out so much hair on my brush after using this and my head was in pain from all the torn hair. After using it I even went back to the bottle to doublee check that I used it properly and that this was, in fact, a conditioner... I don't understand house they can even call this a conditioner because it made my hair worse than not using it at all. Another down side is the brown color-- I am no expert but I'm sure this doesn't benefit blond hair any."
1,"smells amazing, and that's it!","Like others, I was so excited to use this product. Don't let the smell fool you. This conditioner is the WORST THING I HAVE EVER USED! My long hair was tangled up so bad, it took most of the morning to comb the knots out. When my hair dried, it was frizzy, and rough. I'll never use this product again, and let me warn you... don't use it if you have long hair either. :("
1,Don't do it!,"I bought this for the lovely coconut scent, which was great. But....2 weeks after I started to use it I developed a terrible eye infection. I looked online for other strange reactions to the conditioner, and sure enough a lot of women also developed terrible reactions like hand and skin rashes and hair blisters!I stopped using it, but the skin around my eyes even 6 months later still looks bad. I look like I aged about 5 years!"
2,Smells great -- Works horribly,"The shampoo works just like normal shampoo, this conditioner, however, doesn't do a thing. I have pretty fine/thin hair and even if I use a decent size amount of the conditioner, it seems as though I didn't use any. My hair is just as tangled."
2,You call this conditioner?!?,"I'll start off with the good: the smell. And that's where the good ends. The shampoo is so drying and harsh. The conditioner looks thick and creamy, but does nothing to relieve that dryness that the shampoo causes. Usually you can comb your fingers through your hair when the conditioner is in, but I'm lucky if I can get a brush through my hair. I spent at least 10 minutes combing out knots from hair...knots that weren't in my hair before I used Organix. I so wanted this product to work because is smells so amazing but I will be looking for another coconut product that actually works!"
1,HORRIBLE TOO!,"LIKE THE SHAMPOO YOU CAN'T TELL IF IT IS IN YOUR HAIR, NO DE-TANGLING OR SMOOTHNESS. HARD TO COMB HAIR AFTER USE. ONE CHECK FOR OK SMELL."
2,Leave Hair Dry and Lifeless,You would think that with those ingredients it would leave your hair on the oily side. Not so with this product. After using the shampoo and conditioner combination on color treated hair you are left with a dry mess that is in desperate need of a leave in conditioner.
3,A bit too thick,"To second others, I love the shampoo, but this conditioner is just too thick to be able to squeeze out of the bottle without leaving at least half that goes to waste. As for conditioning properties, I guess it's OK."
1,Disappointed,"I had very high hopes when I purchased this product and I have to say it as left me disappointed. I would describe my hair as long and thick it's not naturally curly more like wavy with lots of frizz. I have the hair type that stays bone straight when I use a flat iron, no type of humidity can cause my hair to frizz. This being said I bought this product with the hopes that it would make my hair more manageably and reduce the frizz.This conditioner is very thick and rich almost like paste, it was kind of difficult to squeeze it out of the bottle. After I rinsed the conditioner out I noticed my hair was a lot more tangled than usual. Once dried my hair felt course and my ends looked fried and kinky. My ends where so bad that no matter how any times I went over it with the flat iron it stayed the same. This conditioner did not seem to deliver any kind of moisture what so ever it actually made my hair look more dry and damaged. I will not be using this product again."
3,Bottle needs to be redesigned!,"The conditioner and shampoo are fine, but the 13 oz bottle of conditioner is impossible to squeeze after about three uses. For that matter, I had the same problem with a sample sized bottle of the conditioner. I ended up having to pop the entire top off (not easy to do) and slam the bottle against my palm for the last several uses to get conditioner out. I'm pretty sure I'm going to have to do that again with the 13 oz bottle. The shampoo is not quite so difficult, but they really should redesign the bottles for this entire line. I know that coconut oil is fabulous for hair which is why I wanted to use the Coconut Milk version (it also contains coconut oil), but I'm afraid I can't keep buying it because of the problem with the bottle."
5,Conditioner really works ....,Leaves hair very smooth...I have very fine hair ...so just a 2 quarters and comb it out ...rinse well.
3,not the best conditioner,"I use the Shampoo, which does soften my hair. I use the conditioner and as many have mentioned, it does not condition or moisturize. I wonder if I used another conditioner, if it would improve, not do anything or worsen the effects of the shampoo and the serum after it. It works slightly better on my hair than it does on my daughter's. who has really thick curly hair that forms dreadlocks!"
3,"Doesn't de-tangle, but it keeps hair straight.","Being that this is the final step in the process I thought that this product could have been a lot better. I used the 30 day which was awesome and I use the shampoo everyday and follow up with this. The only thing is, I have long hair that has highlights and this product does not de-tangle and you have to use a ton of it to even condition. It does help your hair stay straight, but at I wish it was more of a de-tangler and added moisture to my hair like other conditioners."
2,Coconut Milk Conditioner Not Good,"I absolutely love the shampoo, but I use a different local organic conditioner since this product does not soften my hair enough either. This conditioner has something in it that does not allow frizzy or curly hair to really soften, maybe the fragrance in it, who knows. But the shampoo is worth every penny."
1,Hilariously BAD!!!,"This is one of the most un-intentionally laugh-out-loud bad, Bad, BAD movies I've ever seen! The script is SO cheesy, as well as the acting and music. It isn't scary at all! I also reccomend THE worst movie I've ever seen, ""Rock n' Roll Nightmare"" (1987), for people who love so-bad-it's funny movies!"
1,NOT WORTH $36.50!!!!!,"This movie is by no means worth 10 dollars new. It is extremely rare but we at the LIMC have reviewed it and its quite boring. Its alot of dialogue about a heavy metal band wanting to play a concert in a small town. So the high school kids have a petition and the PTA is against it. Finally, the concert is thrown and ONE person dies when he gets eaten by one of the loud speakers at the show. The End.A waste of time.-This opinion is of the author only. It does not necessarily reflect the views of the Ligonus International Media Corporation or its affiliates."
1,muddled writing,"I read this based on the Matrix series, I suspect like most. While some of the under lying ideas were decent, I thought the writing style was painful and made reading longer than necessary. The writing style could be blamed on the translation, but never less it was a bit muddled."
2,Worst translation ever!,"This is quite a nice book, with an horrible translation. The translator made no big efforts to find the correct names of places, books and movies. And she also does not help at all if you don't know France and Paris: many places are cited, and you will not know that Beaubourg is an modern art museum if you were not there (luckily, I was over there while reading it).The same occurs for ""Forum de Halles"", which is a huge underground mall, and for ""Stand on Zanzibar"", which was translated back from the French version, resulting in ""Everyone to Zanzibar"", clearly showing that the translator did not even looked for this book name in the internet (that shows no results).Quite interesting ideas, easy to read (you do not need a lot of philosophical background) with such poor translations... more footnotes would have helped a lot!"
5,"Groovy, Trippy and Sexy. A Five Star Catch!","this mature album shows the group can mix well produced ambient tracks with the finest soul flavor I've seen in a while. Music to be heard tripping or loving, the latest dinning rooms album shows us that there's plenty of ""out of pattern"" groovy ambient loops being made out there. fine stuff."
3,Ultimately worth having in your collection,"There is certainly some good music on this album, but the word""Experiments"" in the title should send up a flag. Ultimately, I enjoyed the music on this cd, unfortunately it was often upstaged by what I found to be excessive (and sometimes annoying) lyrics. Still, there are at least a few songs on this disc worth having in your collection, particularly if you are a TDR fan."
2,Don't waste your energy!,"My first exposure to The Dining Rooms was ""Numero Deux,"" which is primarily an instrumental album with great rhythms. I decided to experiment with this album and have been thus far utterly dissatisfied. As the title implies, this is a soul album. They should have left ""ambient"" out of the title because it does not apply. The soul tracks are pathetic, the lyrics are painfully stupid, and the vocalists need some help too. The only redeeming aspects of this album are its few instrumental tracks. This highly creative group can do much better. Save your money!"

1,wrong item/no response,I did not receive the item I ordered and have not heard back from the seller. Not impressed with service so far.
1,Do not ever buy this DVD,"I placed an order in June 1 of 2006 and it was a total disaster. I would like to express my entire dissatisfaction related to the quality of the product. In fact, I did return the item in order to receive another unit and enjoy the DVD's footage at full. I hoped the replacement item to exceed my expectations but it did not. The quality was the same poorly and erratic one I got in the very first DVD. I have decided to throw the product away and not even bother to start a new ""return item"" process. I hope you consider not to buy this DVD. I demand respect not only in terms of expediteness but in terms of quality.I have a small home made video if somebody wants to see what is the truth behind the so publicized product."
4,HIM Love Metal Archives,Item wasn't exaclty as described but seller was excellent with replying to inquiry and email!
2,"Good DVD, too bad its made horribly.","I wish there was some way to know how many of these DVD's are defected. I had the same problem as the reviewer Jose Baldwin Delgado. I watched some of the DVD and some videos could play. But when I started playing some videos such as Wicked Game and The Funeral of Hearts, the video would become stagnet, get black squares and started fading in and out. After a minute of doing this, the video would freeze and then the sound would die shortly thereafter. The ticker on the DVD would still play though. I thought it was just my DVD player, but once I tried it again on two others in my house, I knew it was defective. It has potentieal to be a good DVD (i really am obsessed with this band), but the band should address this problem and have a better company manufacture this DVD."
2,I wouldn't recommend this game,"The visuals are poor. The point of view of the player is always from the side of the golfer. even when putting you don't even see the hole. The game has a very disappointing ""feel"". I've played many other golf games as this is one of the worst."
3,Something Tiger touched that doesn't turn into gold,"Although the graphics do make the most of the GBC, the sounds could be much less annoying. It is rather confusing, so try 'Mario Golf' instead."
5,Fantastic Golf Game,This game rocks. The graphics are great and it is so much fun to play. It is so realistic. Well worth the money.
2,Mr. Schiff is not interested in counterpoint...,"And it is difficult to enjoy this version of the Goldberg Variations for that reason. Instead of bringing out the lines, Schiff washes them together with the pedal in ungainly harmonic blocks. The microphone is too far away from the piano so this just adds to the misery."
1,brush keeps sliding off holder,"Brush keeps on falling off holder. Maybe its just a defective one, but the top part is not angled properly and the brush keeps sliding off."
1,Cheap junk,"This shaving brush holder was broke when it arrived. I can tell it is cheaply made and even with better packaging it probably wouldn't take much to break it. Do not buy. Go with the stainless steel, marble or other metal ones."
2,Small,"As other people said, it was too small to hold my brush. I tried to force the brush into it and one of the prongs snapped right off, I fixed it up with some super glue and duct tape (took only about half an hour or so) and now it works nice. It doesn't look too great though. If you get it and it is too small, try snapping the prong off and putting a small piece of folded paper between the prong and base, it'll add a bit of room between the prongs and will work. If you want something that'll work out of the box, don't buy this. If you don't mind fiddling a little, then go for it.*********UPDATE************The duct tape and super glue started to wear off, my brush started to fall out of the holder. I bought a different holder and trashed this one. I don't reccommend this product. If it does happen to fit your brush, then great, it is an attractive little holder."
2,Needed some modification.,"Has a nice old school look to it, but would be better without the hole and sticky tape on the back(which I removed, since I wanted it to be free standing). I had to grind out the opening where the brush is held to allow it to go in properly. Dremel tool to the rescue. After that it does what it supposed to. Didn't bother me since the price was reasonable, but the quality reflects the price."
5,Well PLeased,"This stand is definitely a ""no frills"" variety, however some of us seek simplicity. Very nice to look at, though. This stand is sturdy, and also came with a covered adhesive pad on the back should you choose to affix it to a wall. For a permanent fixation, the adhesive pad also covers a beveled hole where one could place a screw."
5,Helps Your Shaving Brush Last Longer,"This little stand helps your shaving brush to last longer by hanging it with its bristles down. This helps the water to run off of the tips of the bristles and not collect at the base of the bristles, which can cause the glue to weaken and the bristles to fall out.I bought this stand five years ago when I bought my first shaving brush. It is inexpensive, unobtrusive and has helped my wooden-handled shaving brush keep working half a decade after its original purchase.That makes it a winner for me. Would definitely buy again."
4,As advertised,"Can't beat the price and it does what it's supposed to do, keep your brush down and drying out properly."
5,Perfect,Bought this for my shaving brush from the art of shaving and it fits pretty well. Very happy with it and it looks pretty cool.
1,Design os not effective,Can't wrap this product around my neck so it actually touches your skin therefore it is useless to me. It is not moldable until tje ice insert melts which makes it a poor design.
2,Extremely disapointed.,"I bought this one because it seemed like the best value for the money. But in the end I was pretty disappointed with it. I would have thought that Toshiba was a dependable quality product but I was wrong. I ended up returning this player because it kept freezing up. It wouldn't respond to anything, even the off button, and I kept having to unplug the darn thing and plug it in to get it back to normal again. It would do this with both DVD's and CD's. This gets to be a pain in the butt when your entertainment centre weighs a couple hundred pounds and the plug is way back there behind it. I was also disappointed with the random feature. You could play 5 CD's at random but it had to be 2 songs from each CD before it would randomly pick the next. Why 2 songs? I wanted random, not pairs. Otherwise, it seemed to have great picture, but even the cheapest DVD players have great picture. I'm not sure which brand I'll move onto but I think I'll pay a bit more this time."
1,Extend the length of you move (and stress),"I have a daughter (3) whom uses (w/o assistance) the DVD player more than I use the stove. I am very unhappy with the frequent ""pausing"" and the problems I have ran into with several videos (the Toshiba doesn't recognize it until a power cycle...sometimes not at all). I can honestly recommend that a user looks at a different unit instead of purchasing a Toshiba. A friend has an AIWA and another a JVC, each without problems.Good overall quality (plenty of capabilities), but the freezing conditions (1 sec to 1 min) cancel every other nice feature out.This DVD player has changed my complete feelings regarding Toshiba, from DVD players, to laptops, to cameras...now out of the equation (still rank ""slightly"" above Packard Bell)"
2,2 problems in 6 months,Other Toshiba products have performed reasonably well but this one's a dud. It's a good value featurewise but the control actions are agonizingly slow and the panel input went out after 4 months (after the labor warranty ran out). AND there's a strange sound distortion when playing half of the CD-audio discs that I've tried. Avoid.
1,Big disapointment,"This is my first DVD from Toshiba and my last. I had the unit 4 months now the unit does not work properly. The door opens and closes on its own and does not play anything. I did not purchase the extra warranty from best buy figuring the unit was inexpensive for a 5-disk changer and if it broke after a year or two I get a newer model. Although, I am getting it fixed since Toshiba will extend the warranty at no cost it is a hassle to go through the return process. This unit also had a lot of freezing while viewing DVDs when it did work. I still don't believe in extra warranties but I will by a better unit this time."
3,Pay attention....you SHOULD be scared!,"We cannot continue running on the status quo. We live in a different world. Things went shockingly back to normal 6 months after 9/11 and it really hasn't changed. I'm all for bringing more troops home and protecting our own shores. I want my son to have a life, and his sons, and so on. But it won't happen the way things are going now. If every person in this country committed to the idea of a safer nation, if government and the private sector, together, would pony up the money and the resources, we could at least have a fighting chance. But as the author says, every day that we don't have a terrorist attack, complacency grows. This book is a good slap upside the head, too bad it will get passed off by a lot of folks as pre-election hype."
5,Garmin Motorcycle Power Cable for Zumo 550,This came with the Zumo when you buy the Motorcycle package. I didn't know now I have two. One I used on my Trike. Works well easy to use and connect. You may ask why I don't send it back and get money back well I saveing it for when I get another motorcycle I can move the Zumo back and forth easily.
4,the debussy songbook,"Thank you Dawn Upshaw for programming on one CD the 'big' collections of the Debussy vocal repertory. The only other recording which has most of these vocal collections is Barbara Hendrick's 'Melodies' CD which has the Ariettes oubilees and the Baudelaire Poems, but it lacks the Vasnier Songbook. Upshaw's disc is a rare find with its wider-encompassing collection. She is accompanied by the very capable, James Levine, NY MET Conductor. Levine's touch and balance in voicing chords gives the right 'color' to accompany the fluid lines of Debussy's text setting. Upshaw is able to connect long lines with that 'milky' texture her voice is known for, giving an impassioned performance for the listener."
1,Product never received.,Boaters World does not remove items from their inventory that they do not carry in stock. Instead they keep you holding while they try to get the merchandise from the manufacturer. I would have preferred to have been told they do not carry the product. After a lengthy wait they advise that the product is no longer manufacturered.
1,standard plastic cup holders,I bought 30 of these for a bus trip for a ladies club and they arrived all black. I would never do this again cause I only received one color - black and they are not like the pictures at all. I could have ordered all black ones on eBay for a cheaper price. A little disappointing cause as you can see the picture has an assortment of colors and I was going to color code the holders to different sections on the bus along with gift bags and it messed up my plan. This was very disappointing and would have returned them but didn't want to lose my shipping cost which was almost as high as the items. Will not recommend this seller.
3,It's small and you cannot choose your own color,I ordered this believing I would be able to choose one of the many colors available but I was wrong. After I hit the order button I immediately emailed them requesting a specific color. Instead I was told that it was already being processed even though it was not shipped for another 4 days. I was shipped 2 different colors and noticed that the holders were kind of small. It almost fits a 20oz styrofoam cup but it doesn't touch the bottom of the holder. My only consolation is the price. Too cheap to return but wouldn't buy from them again.
4,You won't fit anything too big in one,"They're smaller than they look. So far nothing has fallen out, but bigger mugs or bottles won't fit. They serve their purpose"
5,LOVE THIS!!!!!,"We may be using this item unconventionly (not in a car at all)... it's makes the perfect sippy cup holder on the side of our toddlers ""big girl bed"". Because the bed has the safety railings on the sides, we simply hung it over the side and viola, instant access to her water all night long! It is perfect, has held up very well, and was a huge BARGAIN! Wish it came in different colors (bright) and that you had the ability to choose."
2,"Cheap, kinda works","Always pops off the door when I shut it, now I just have it in the back of the car holding a scented gel."
4,One of Van's understated albums,"A very understated album from Van Morrison prior to release of his critically acclaimed ""Poetic Champions Compose"". Van engages in some deep introspection on ""Got to Go Back"" and ""In the Garden"", the latter which addresses the album title.Van draws on Irish folk music to pen the beautiful ""One Irish Rover"" and pays homage to the Gaelic language in ""Tir Na Nog"" - land of the young.A very laid back album full of hauntiing and romantic songs in the genre that preceded Van's ""blues period"" about 10 years later."
5,Appreciating 'Van the Man',"I fell in love with ""Astral Weeks"" long, long ago, and began to collect Van Morrison albums. I'm just catching up on those of his which I don't have. I love his voice, and his sometimes hard to understand lyrics. I always feel as if so much ""soul"" comes out of his voice. I very much enjoy the Celtic influence, as well, and love the mysticism that I seem to hear in these particular songs.For people who like Van Morrison, this is a ""must have"" album, so far as I'm concerned. I think all of them are, actually.I only have about 3 more albums to get, and then I'll have all of Van Morrison's wonderful music."
5,PLENTY OF METHOD,"One of Van's best albums, every track is great, especially with the awesome SHM. Must have for any CD collection, but don't pay these ridiculous over-inflated rip off prices. I purchased mine from The Music Specialist on E Bay, save yourself a ton of cash!"
5,If you could only have 10 discs while trapped on an island..,"Well, simply a masterpiece. While poetic champions compose, astral weeks and several others are fantastic, this is Van's true musical map for other artists. This one has many layers and takes several listens to absorb. A spiritual, mystical adventure. If you are going to buy one Van, this is it. However , Van has many, many wonderful albums going all the way back to his early rough stuff with his band Them. If you are new to Van you're starting with the right one, but there are many, many more dishes Van has put at the table for you to enjoy!"
3,Doesn't stick as well as some others,"I'm a big Van fan. I'm slowly building my collection to include all of his discs. At about 1/3 of the way I find this to be a beautiful, soulful cd with fewer standouts. It's a ...nice, smooth recording and a bit generic. It does include some real gems but overall it's not as magical as he can be. Tracks to listen to: ""Ivory Tower,""""One Irish Rover,"" ""Got To Go Back,"" ""Tir Na Nog""."
5,Better Than Excedrin Migraine,"This, along with Poetic Champions Compose, paints a picture of such peaceful, spirtual warmth that it can cure a stress headache faster than anything one can buy over the counter. This is from a singer/songwriter that knows exactly where he is going with this album and takes us along with him for the beautiful, joyous ride. Van's spirtuality shines through on this album like the noonday sun breaking completely free of clouds, but is as gently persuasive as an early evening breeze. Van vividly paints scene after scene with his writing, his voice and tremendous musical arrangements. Listen to this while gazing up at the night sky. One of the 100 Greatest Albums on the Ken Carroll Scale."
5,Six songs for the ages,"The first six songs on this disc stack up against any music I've heard in my 35 years as a collector, and the last four are pretty darn good, too. This record and the one that followed, Poetic Champions Compose, show an artist continuing to make great music long after exiting the pop music spotlight. Van Morrison has had an extraordinary career--remarkably, largely under the radar--and these songs are a beacon to his fertile middle period. Essential."
2,overrated,"unnecessary if you're on the lookout for astral weeks type magnificence w/ emotional urgency, I feel this one has a jazzy indifference that puts me off.. simply it's indifferent opposed to the WEEKS"
5,The Best of the Best,An excellent book. Actually it was purchased for a friend. I enjoy anything that is written by Susan Polis Shultz.
5,DEFINITELY POSITIVE,"POSITVE THINKING IS DEFINITELY LIKE ALANGUAGE IN AND OF ITS SELF. I BOUGHTTHIS BECAUSE I REALLY LOVE THE WHOLEPOSITIVE CONCEPT OF NOT JUST THINKINGPOSITIVE THOUGHTS, BUT ALSO UNDERSTANDINGAND USING POSITIVE WORDS AND IN A POSITIVEWAY. THERE ARE POSITIVE WAYS OF SAYING,THINKING, WRITING, AND USING SPECIFICCHOSEN WORDS THAT UPLIFT. FOR POSITIVETHOUGHTS, I ALSO RECOMMEND CARD COLLECTIONSBY DIANA NEIDERHISER."
2,Disappointed,"We bought this bank for our 7 year old son who kept his money in a shoe box. I loved the way it looked and felt - very solid and heavy. My son jammed it within minutes of putting in his coins. A dime didn't go all the way down (which is hard to tell unless you're looking down into it) and the next coin jammed up next to it. I couldn't fix it and my dad ended up taking it apart. But with the coins jammed in there, once they were released, the 'clicker' didn't work anymore and didn't count the money. My son actually got another bank for Christmas, so this one just sits on a shelf and looks pretty."
2,Rocket USA Uncle Same Register Bank,"I bought this bank for all my grandchildren. We were disappointed in the quality of the product for the price. It is very hard to get the money out once you reach the $10 mark. I liked the idea that you could only open the bank at $10. Good to teach savings to our grandchildren, but it is hard to use and not as durable as some reviews indicated."
4,"It,s only Love","This is one of the best mixes of tracks from Mick Hucknall,demonstrating his great voice and sensitivity.A great choice if you haven,t heard much of his work before. Tracks I especially like are #13 and 17. Number 17 Mellow my mind is a really beautiful rendition of this Neil Young song, worth buying the album just for this."
5,this will get rid of that nasty sore on your lip,I had a fever blister that I just couldn't get rid of. I tried everything and it just hurt! I used this on it and in two days it was almost gone. Feels very soothing.
4,Works great....but it's pricy....try this instead,This works great. Have been getting blisters/cold sores on my lip whenever I go out in HOT sunny weather. But I fee it's too pricy. For about [...] you get very small quantity. After doing some more reseach I found L-Lysine ointement from Basic Oragnics which is sold at local GNC store. I paid about [...] and it has 4 times the quantity. And it works great too.[...]
5,Excellent introduction for IT students,"This book is great for students who want to become IT professionals. It's more than just learning how to use client-side operating systems. In this book, you learn how to install, configure and troubleshoot, and includes coverage of networking. Read this and you're on your way to an A+ certfication not to mention a desktop support or help desk position. It's a beautifully designed book."
2,Boring boring and more boring....,"I really wonder what some people think...there is absolutely not one risk taken here in terms of nuance and phrasing! Simply put, if you like to sleep alot the Wind Concertante is is just dull...deLancie is the only imaginative one here...the intonation of the clarinet is flat and the horn doesn't seem to be in tune with the upper octave in some of the more exposed melodic lines...The Violin and Viola work is much better, Szell seems to have this piece totally under control and soloist are excellent...typical CBS sound..."
3,Carton or One Box ?,Be aware that there's some confusion on this item. I ordered this because the blurb above clearly says 6 boxes per carton each box containing 160 sheets. The order arrived promptly. However what we got was one box of 160 sheets! Not a deal at all considering the shipping/handling charges took my bill to almost $20. Called Restockit and was told basically that I needed to get my money back from Amazon.
4,Works as advertised,"I use this with aTweezerman Men's Shaving Brushand the fit is acceptable. It seems to get hung up on the metal ring surrounding the knot, but it works as advertised and dries the brush in the recommended orientation."
4,cheap,just wanted something to store a shaving brush and this was the cheapest thing i found--will probably replace it with something nicer at some point--it does the job
5,Nice,"Nice, cheap stand, used double stick tape to put it up, would buy again if needed it. three words needed"
1,Cheap plastic,"Broken when arrived from amazon. The item is made from cheap plastic and was broken when I received it. Don't waste your money on this one, buy a better one."
2,doesn't hold my brush,not adjustable and not wide enough to hold my shaving brush. considering that I only paid a few bucks for it I can search for another brush.
2,Shallow song from Shallow Hal,"I was interested in this album because of the song from Shallow Hal ""This is My World"" and I was hoping that the rest of the songs would reveal a surprise. I was surprised all right. I didn't care for any other piece of work."
2,Over produced,"This cd has a over produced sound , wasnt really happy with it. Too bad, such a wasted talent, he should stick to Hootie and the blowfish material . he seems to sound so much better with them, Hootie fans will be- Disappointed in this one. But for R & B that sounds like every other R &B cd, this is the one for you. Very disappointing ."
2,Tight Vocals average Material,Darius Rucker has a Really Good voice to me but His Material overall doesn't equal His Voice.I wish He could have Worked with say Gamble&Huff do a 2-3 Lou Rawls Re-Makes&Let Frankie Knuckles Re-Mix them you'd truly capture a Soulful Force then.He never truly gets the right Material to match His Vocals.the Brother Can Sing but the Material is a Step Beneath Him.
2,OMIGOSH What was he thinking!!!!!,"Disclaimer: I am the biggest fan of Hootie and the Blowfish as well as Darius Rucker and I've followed his many duets and solo performances to include Star Spangled Banner and small clubs in two different countries.What in the hell was he thinking? His voice is an instrument and did not belong on this CD. The music was of porn movie quality, the mixing was poor, the genre was inappropriate and the only redeeming quality was Darius' voice (especially a capella)Why? The only quality again was his voice. Why then not simply cut an a capella spiritual CD. It couldn't sell any less volume.Was it a musical statement? What was the statement? Perhaps that a performer the quality of Darius can even make absurd decisions.I simply do not see anything redeeming on this CD except for Darius. I hope D.R. is finished trying to make a statement and will go back to higher quality, more palatable music.What the hell is ""from the ruda to the tuda"""
5,Hidden Treasure,"I love this CD. I was never a big fan of Hootie and the Blow Fish but I always liked the sound of Darius Ruckers voice. I was so glad when I heard he was making a solo CD. His voice is so soulful and soothing. My absolute favorites Exodus, Sometimes I Wonder with Jill Scott, I'm Glad your mine, Ten Years and One More Night. He could have left off Sleeping in my Bed with Snoop Dogg. I am ready for the next solo CD by Darius Rucker."
4,ok......u came through!,"U surprised the hell outta me. The album is a lot better than what i expected it to be. Great job. There is 2 or 3 songs that dont make it for me, but, overall your'e on on steady rotation in my box. Thanx 4 the sounds Hootie....i mean...Darius."
3,Too diverse,"Well, this CD by the most soulful baritone on the planet is a dramatic change from the Hootie sound, especially when placed in the context of the Hootie CD just released, which is a good listen but not a remarkable record. Darius Rucker's voice is a thing of beauty. No one, love him or dislike him, can challenge the fact that his voice is a singular, shake the walls, treasure. Having said that, his CD strays from the emotional, incredible R & B/pop of Exodus and This is my World to a couple of hip hop flops and a take on Amazing Grace that sounds like a high school recording. I absolutely love half this CD and the other half is boring and disappointing. I applaud Darius Rucker for stepping out on his own and putting together a record which reflects his tastes and styles. He has a great solo disc in him. This is not it, but there are some fantastic moments!"
4,This is My World is My Favorite Song!,"I thought that the song, ""This is My World,"" which I remembered for the film, Shallow Hal, was the kind of song that should have been nominated for an Academy Award whether it was for the film or not. Anyway, I picked this compact disc and really enjoy listening to it for the most part. I honestly didn't know that Darius Rucker was a country singer or part of Hootie and Blowfish. He has a soothing voice and sings great songs."
3,Great for younger kids,"This is a cute program, but not as ""exciting"" as other Jump Start games. It was a little too young for our 8 year old, and she quickly lost interest. Would probably be great for 4-6 year olds."
3,Not Very Comfortable,Ordered these for the kids and they tell me the seat is very hard and uncomfortable for any length of time. I gave them some pillows to sit on!
3,Pretty good.,"This was a pretty good book. Nothing on my top shelf list or anything. It was kind of slow in some parts and with my ADHD it was hard to keep my attention at times. :p Overall on a 1-10 scale I would give it a 6 meaning above average. Not as good as ""His Dark Materials"" but worth getting if you have a road trip to take and need something to keep you occupied during the drive.Chad."
4,A good Pullman novel,"This book was a very exciting story, but a little less real compared to his other works. However, it was a great story and I think that anyone would enjoy it if they are a fantasy story reader."
4,A strange book but in a good way.,This book is good. It has strange twists in and out through the book. Although it took me a while to figure out the main character was a girl in this book and what the plot was it was still a good book. The ending was very strange though. But all and all a good book.
4,Is this Edward Gorey?,"Excellent book for young adults and adults alike, Count Karlstien is a mixture of Roald Dahl and Edward Gorey. After finishing the His Dark Materials Trilogy, I ran to the nearest bookstore to find more books by Phillip Pullman - and this did not disappoint. I would warn, however, that Count Karlstein is meant for a younger audience than the Golden Compass, and therefore, is a bit more of a children's book. Still fun nonetheless."
2,"5 Inch Hook & Loop Sanding Discs, 8 Holes, 40 Grit, Box of 50.","Everything would be fine but I didn't get what I ordered. Instead of ""Mirka"" sanding discs I got some other company's ( USA1 Abrasives) products which don't have numbers on the back indicating what grit they are and many of discs are glued to each other so when you try to separate them the glue stays on the sanding surface. I don't think I want to buy this products on Amazon any more."
3,Decent value.,"Both meters are a little sluggish. I needed an analog meter to monitor resistance fluctuations on pots and it was just able to keep up. Having both digital and analog meters is pretty handy, though. I would definitely recommend this multimeter for first time users/students."
5,Simple but works as intended.,I think it's an overpriced piece of metal but it does the work. It is shorter than I was expecting but it handles my shaving brush just well.

4,the spray is nice,"The spray is nice for sensitive bottoms, since you do not have to rub, and it is not messy like the ointments that you need to coat heavily. I also bought some for my niece and her Mom likes it too - she had less redness. Personally, I like this only in early stages. If it keeps progressing, I found that 100% pure shea butter works great on my guy. I've only found one place that has the shea butter that has all the healing components it is supposed to - Rosemary's Thyme. Hope this helps."
1,Customer Service,"The CPen byself is a good thing but the software and the technical support is not working. Nobody can help you, there should be a registration code in the Pen, to get it later you have to call Sweden an so long. I think the product is not ready for the market. It work's only with a couple PC's. I have tryed 3 different Laptop PC's with Windows ME, not one worked correctly with the Pen."
1,NO SUPPORT,"Let's be honest.This product ain't cheap. It's not something you can just throw away if it decides to stop working.I bought mine at cpenusa.com. Delivery was great, only took them a couple of days. However, my c-pen cable was damaged. The connector to the c-pen was, for some reason, cut in half. Without it, you can't recharge or connect the c-pen to the pc.I called their main office all the way in Sweden during the office hours. NO RESPONSE. I sent three e-mails to cpenusa. NO RESPONSE.I don't care if the product itself is great(I'll never know now, will I..). If you're unable to receive support when you need 'em, you're screwed.If you're just interested in electronic equipments, just want to try things out and don't really care if you're on your own, go ahead and try it. Let me know how this thing really is. Otherwise, buy a product that you can trust on with respect to after-sales support."
1,Did not meet my expectations,"I had recently purchased the C-pen 800c and it didn't quite me my expectations. Besides the poor, flimsy casing and quality of the pen, The 800c had difficulty trying to read the words or phrases i was trying to scan. I had to scan it 3 or 4 times to actually get the pen to accurately scan what I was highlighting and it still came out wrong. The calendar, address book and notepad were hard to input data and was very time consuming. Alot of joggling and scrolling in and out of menus and options. Not a very efficient tool for a business indidual on Time Management. The only good thing out of the Cpen is that it's compact and it charged up very fast. The pen got hot when it fully charged though..hmm.."
1,BEWARE !!! I GOT A DEFECTIVE CD!,The tracks on this are not those of Alain Souchon. It's a quality assurance problem at Virgin France.
3,"OK, but not worthy of 5 stars!","I bought this because of the reviews above. Boy was i let down. This is no doubt a great book/cd IF you want to learn improv which is along the lines of ""old school"" jazz. It wasn't very ""modern"" or ""progressive"" at all to me. Maybe Vic has a rep which demands loyalty to his works, i don't know, but i found that his solos are indeed great at first , only to become boring at last. It really is good stuff if you like this style though, but the description was a little misleading. I felt like i took a time trip back to the 50's. Vic has good note choice, but he repetitively plays too much of the same stuff. I also don't think this suites advanced players as well. Hope this helps."
5,Only Love Heals ....,"Spiritual wisdom of the heart whose root is compassion. The Dalai Lama is so generous in sharing his thought process on why an expansion of love is valuable to everyone. Love heals in a way nothing else can. It is the force that turned around a Jewish zealot who arrested Christians from Saul to Disciple Paul on the road to Damascus, turned a tax collector into a Apostle, and conquered the once pagan Roman Empire into the Holy Sea. Buddhism has grown into popularity in the West as its approach to love concentrates on compassion to such a high extent that there can only be love left in its wake. A brilliant illumination on the nature of love. This book is for Buddhists and non-Buddhists. We are affected by the thoughts we expose ourselves to, in whatever media they appear, do your dharma and karma a universe of good .... and open your heart and head to the Dalai Lama's teachings on expanding love."
5,Take Your Time,Take your time reading this book. Do the excercises suggested. You might need to take a year with one of the meditations generously offered by His Holiness. And watch your life change and your love expand. Amazing. True. On the mark.
3,Could easily have been designed for 3 dimensions,"The circular bubble levels mounted in this unit are much easier to use than those containing linear bubble tubes. Also, the build quality is excellent, with the outer housing and hot shoe base constructed of metal. I didn't test if the bubble fluids might freeze under cold conditions. That said, I agree with the reviewer above that this level is useless for shooting vertically upward or downward. The sad thing is that this could easily have been remedied at no additional cost by a simple design change. Slotting the base for the hot shoe on all four sides instead of just two would have allowed the level on the side of the unit to be positioned facing the photographer."
3,only two axes,"The jobu Desing level is well made, little heavy.It is useful but It attach only in one position and have only two bubbles. You couldn't use it if you put your camera for shoting up or down (cenit or nadir).They can solve it, giving the option of two position or adding another bubble in X axis.The two bubble spirit level made of acrilic resin is more useful."
2,"The Good, the bad, and the really ugly","The material in the book is pretty straight forward. It introduces you to Autocad 2005 and walks you through the procedures pretty good. As far as I got! That's the good. The bad was because I got the ebook version I had to keep jumping back and forth between Adobe Acrobat Reader and Autocad when I had questions. Now the UGLY!! If your computer crashes. You've lost your book. Or at least the security key to read it. The book is still on my D drive, but apearently the security key to view it was stored somewhere on C drive, which crashed, and it is now gone, and the ebook is worthless. And by the way, don't think about printing it out. It's well over 700 pages and the security key only allows 30 pages to print a month. Lets see; how many years is that.....?"
5,Best Dark Chocolate Bar I've Found,"I've tried every dark chocolate bar I can find and this is definitely my favorite. My wife's too. It is so much better than the other options that we were willing to travel an extra 20 miles to shop at the grocery store that carried them. Alas, it is now only available online..."
3,MOVIES,MAINLY BOUGHT IT FOR ONE OF THE MOVIES THE OTHERS WERE A BONUS. CAN ONLY GIVE IT THREE STARS BECAUSE ONE OF THE MOVIES WILL NOT PLAY.
3,The Harper's Quine,"The story was somewhat predictable and seemed to reflect a common theme--struggling young ""detective"" type, mentor type and precocious daughter/love interest. My major complaint was not being able to find many of the foreign words in the dictionary. A little local color language goes a long way. I don't know if I will purchase others in this series or not."
5,A find!,"I am always looking for new historical mystery series, and this first of the Gil Cunningham stories was a find. (For plot details refer to other reviews.) It is not a period I am that familiar with, and also was unfamiliar with some of the scots and erse (?) vocabulary. Nonetheless, there were likeable main characters and interesting investigative episodes. The stage is set for the next in the series and I am eager to read on.For fans of the Fidelma, Hawkenlye by Alys Clare or even Bruce Alexander's series, this could be of interest."
3,Good mystery... but old english words make it difficult,I enjoyed this mystery but found the use of 'old' words that were not even in my kindle dictionary not only incomprehensible but annoying... for capturing the 'feeling' of that time period they were great ... but either put a footnote or make the next sentence somehow explanatory... almost put the book down because of it but plodded on...in spite of that.... I bought the next one...
2,VERY hard to follow.,"May be easy to follow if you're familiar with Scots, but those who aren't, it's a challenge. The storyline was interesting but it's clearly not written for a non-Scottish readership."
1,Pass this by for UNION.,"THE WOMAN'S BOAT, the 3rd album from Toni Childs, is a major disappointment. It's even more disappointing then her second, HOUSE OF HOPE. Toni's been completely unable to follow up her excellent, excellent debut, UNION. This one is the worst, all overblown world music. UNION is the one Toni Childs cd not to miss."
1,Unfinished,"Perhaps it's unfair of me to rate this book, since I didn't make it to the end. It was disappointing, since I've liked others of Coover's books. This one is written in a stream of consciousness style reminiscent of James Joyce/""Ulysses"" (which I liked a lot). Similarly, it also is incredibly literate and erudite, lots of language play which still somehow was mostly just hard and not fun the way language should and can be. I could appreciate the humor intellectually, but it wasn't really funny. The subject matter is a cynical take on a dark subject, the Rosenberg executions. I can certainly understand why its release was so contoversial. It might help to know more about the period but as someone who came of political age (later) during the Watergate years I know little about Nixon as VP and many of the social references were lost on me."
2,"Started out strong, then slide into name-dropping","I was inspired to read this book after hearing Elizabeth Edwards interviewed about it on NPR. In the first few chapters the writing is strong and engaging, particularly as she poignantly shares the truly painful experience of her son's death. But the book slowly digresses into a travelogue of events and name-dropping. I kept thinking...""She's trying to include every possible name that might have something to offer if there's ever a future campaign."" She also tries too hard to convince us she's ""just a normal gal from North Carolina"" who considers everyone ""family."" I certainly agree with her thesis that we should all try harder to connect with the people around us. But more and more I felt the book was self-promoting and phony."
3,Good!,I have not had a chance to read the whole book yet but it seems pretty good! I personally thought it would be more of a Christian book but it's not! I am not into politics and it seems that what it is a lot of!
2,Disappointed!,"I was surprised at the content of the story. She went on and on about her father.This was anoying to me, as her life so far has involved many people. I cannot relate to the loss of her son and hope I never have to. She does give her inner most thoughts on losing a child, which may have been good for her and others in her position. Her health problems and husband, I'm sure made it a difficult book to write. If she left her father out more, this would have been a good read."
3,Saving Graces,I thought there would be more life lesseons addressed from her adult life as a mother and wife.
3,gift for a friend,"I ordered this book for a friend and I think she was pleased dwith it, at least she didn't give me any negative feed back"
5,Like talking with a dear friend,I love this book! Elizabeth's writing style makes the reader feel like you are liatening to a dear friend. The wisdom she shares is life altering. I am so emotionally taken by her story I can only read a few chapters at a time and then feel the need for a little break. This is a must read and is sure to bring you to tears. This country and this world has lost a very wise woman.
5,Excellent.,Eliabeth Edwards writes with painful honesty and hope. She is an extrordinary woman and this glimpse into her soul is a wonderful read.
5,10 stars at best!,"I watched Elizabeth Edwards on Oprah and went out the very next day to purchase the book. I couldn't read it fast enough. What an amazing woman! I would definitely recommend this book to a mother who's been devestated by the loss of a child. As a woman who has lost an infant, I was deeply touched by her story. The loss almost devestated my marriage, but we stayed strong. I wish I'd had the type of inner circle of friends she had. From reading this book, I learned no matter what obstacles we face in life, it's never too late to pick up the pieces and live your life to the fullest!"
3,Intriguing,"The book was quite intriguing as Edwards takes the reader through her incredible journey of pain and loss. The woman has definitely been through a great deal. HOwever, one thing that disturbed me was hot it seemed that poor Cate, her daughter, was completely overshadowed by the loss of Wade and by the birth of the new children. Perhaps I am overly sensitive."
5,Positive,"Perfect merchandise, seller. I loved this book so much I have ordered two more, I want to give it to a lot of my friends."
2,"Well written, but not what I expected","This book is an overall biography of Elizabeth Edwards' life, not a story of her walk through breast cancer (as I expected). The book is well written and especially interesting in the first half. The latter half of the book I found to be very dull -- lots of places and names mentioned, but no real story. It is almost as though she needed to fill pages, so we are forced to yawn our way through the end of the book. It is a shame -- Edwards is such a gifted writer. I hope she will write more in the future, but from a personal point of view. She has great potential, and much to offer!"
5,Great collection,"Coates gives the reader the essentials in this ""uncovered"" edition. While I would have preferred an index, this collection serves as a wonderful primary source for the student of gay history, and a great read for anyone interested in Oscar Wilde or one of the earliest modern legal defenses of homosexuality. Despite surprising claims that the ""love that dare not speak its name"" defense is *not* a defense of homosexuality, even the most cursory read will show it is a brilliant defense of homosexual love in the classical (age-differentiated) sense, which was the very type of romantic/sexual relationship Oscar Wilde and Bosie Douglas had formed."
4,Great for shipping,Bought this for eBaying some xBox and DS games. The smallest size work great for Nintendo DS games including the case. It is everything you need to mail something out securely and a great price.
1,Poor qaulity,"The material is very cheap, but you get what you pay for it. It didn't cost much. So I expected that."
5,Useful Resource,"The author deals with menopause in an intelligent, compassion manner. Great book and great resource!"
4,Very well planed,The game it self is a fun play but it is not the same with the smaller screen the entrances and titantron are great and the top rope moves are very exciting the only thing is the the size of the characters big show looks good but in real life hes alot taller than all the other wrestlers so it is a fun game which you can play for a long time so i suggest to you even if you dont like wrestling
3,Ok,"Its good but it needs more superstars, arenas and matches there are no divas and there are only 2 titles to win and the entrance themes don't play the superstars music."
1,stupid game,this is the worst game everyone has the same moves and it is way to hard to control the wrestlers there is only like 10 guys ...
1,Junk!,"If you buy the Jumpstart Phonics be sure to get the right version. 1.01 is total junk. Very outdated. Tells you to press the ""return key"" and use the arrows instead of the mouse. I sat for 20 minutes and did my best to get my 4 year old interested. With all the other software he had he just got totally frustrated as did I!. With all that said I will probably buy the new version which is what I was trying to buy all along!"
2,Big Disappointment,We own other Jump Start Products. This is certainly not up to their usual standards. Trying to use the microphone is extrememly irritating. I don't know if it's because my voice is the voice of an old person or if its because my grand daughter does not speak plainly (do most three year olds? but the voice interaction is very unsatisfactory as it never seems to understand what we say and keeps asking us to repeat it.
3,Remember when soundtracks were soundtracks?,"This is your typical, ""music from and inspired by"" album. The songs on this album are good but i agreee with all of the other reviewers that coldplay's ""sparks"" should have been included because it is featured in the movie. You don't hear it in the background, it is all you hear for a good couple of minutes. Other than that, this is a good collection of songs. Although I thought for sure that I heard ben kweller singing toward the end of the movie. If ben was also left off the soundtrack, this review goes down to 1 star for leaving off two of my favourite artists. To the reviewer asking about the slow song that is not coldplay, I think this is the song you are looking for."
4,Pretty Good!,"This CD is full of songs that are good to listen to straight through. Not to memorable, but not too boring!"
1,TRANCE ??? HA......,"MR.DEVITO GO BACK TO YOUR RADIO HITS YOU CAN MIXED TRANCE ,AND THIS MUSIC IS NOT TRANCE ITS MORE LIKE HARDHOUSE DEVITO GET YOUR MUSIC RIGHT"
1,What was he thinking!,"I Never been an louie Devito fan but I do have to admit that NYC Underground 3 was really good wich is by the way the only louie devito cd that I own, After that Cd came NYCU4 which in my opinion It was the worst ""dance"" cd I ever heard, Then Dance Factory came along wich was basiclly tunes you hear on the radio nothing inovative probably good it if had come out in 2001 ,If i had to change its title I'll name It ""Radio Greatest Hits"", But that not all now Trance Sessions came out, Which by the way its not what I would call trance, Its mixing is poor with is usual on louie's albums. I have to addmit that When I heard The title of the cd i really thought that it was gonna be good but i guess i was wrong again about louie, I think what he needs to do is have a trip to Ibiza and learn what Trance is about, o and take mixing lessons too....In conlution: Dont waste your money."
1,"Louie's ""Trance"" Embarasses The Genre","First of all, Louie Devito....spinning trance....is like seein Armin Van Buuren at a country music festival- it shouldn't happen! Granted the NYC Underground Party series was a success, but why come out with a cd highlighting a genre of music that you know nothing about?? I'm glad I didn't waste my money on this and waited for a friend to buy it first- simply horrible. This cd in no way represents trance music...I'm hoping this cd was just a temporary experiment gone terribly wrong. Some of the tracks (Quo Vardis - Sonic Boom, D-Devils - The Final Countdown, Toolboy - Fear The Drill) are somewhat decent but in no way make for a good cd. Maybe when they first came out nearly a year or more ago, but not for 2002. He should stick to music he knows, like those tired old tracks radio stations hammer (basically his entire Dance Factory CD). ..."
3,This CD is great for a club,"When i looked at this cd i thought well hey ill give it a shot its Louie Devito, turns out i wasnt to happy with this 1. I was actually surprised and i wanted to get my money back. So i sat down and listened to the whole CD and there are a few acceptions to this cd such as: E-Ject - The Pressure (I've heard of this song before), Sonic Boom - Quo Vadis (excellent song) Sushi - The Moon (The beginning is terrible but it gets better as the song gradually moves along) Derb In Africa - Derb( This song is also awesome, the bass pumping and everything) My all time favorite on this cd is Tropicana (Feat. DJ Bart) - Things To Come. If you have just heard of Louie Devito and want to get to know some of his real good tunes i would miss this 1 and go for his NYC Albums"
1,What happend to the mixing?,"This CD is like Trance Party, The Mixing Is Bad, Buy Vol. 1-4 Of Underground Party ,"
3,"Its OK, But Better Options Are Available","The Neo Bird Freeform Pen is a somewhat uniquely designed pen that mostly works as described in the product write up, but it also does take some getting used to. First the good, the pen really does reduce the hand stress that writing for long periods causes. I have mild arthritis in my hands and the pen does make a difference. Now the bad, it takes a while to get used to using the pen and it feels awkward for the first few minutes, every time. Like a lot of these products, individual preferences make a big difference since my wife (who has fairly bad arthritis in her hands) can't stand this pen at all. We both prefer theBlue Original PenAgain Pens.Also note that refills for this pen might be hard to find."
4,"Good, but not chocolatey enough.","I'm glad that this hot cocoa had actual bits of candy cane in it instead of just ""flavoring"" but it was sort of bland when it came to the actual ""chocolatey taste"" Good for the price though."
4,Tasty!,"I would give this product a full 5-Star rating if they could get the little candy cane crunchies to float on top. The flavor is awesome; hot cocoa with a minty hint (From the melted candy cane bits is my guess). Since I have a K-cup brewer, I just heat up the water and pour in the packet. One note here - don't put the powder in before you pour in the water, unless you like scraping the candy bits off the bottom of your cup. All in all, a very nice cup of cocoa for a decent price."
5,Simply Delicious!,"I bought this hot chocolate from Walmart, but I can no longer get it there. I was happy to find Amazon offering it, and at a great price. I love the chocolate taste, but I am just tickled pink with the bits of peppermint in my cup. Everytime I go for a packet, I feel like its my special treat. Now, my two boys are completely hooked on it. Seems like every night their requesting now they want a delicious Stephens peppermint hot chocolate. I highly recommend this product. I am going back to try their other flavors too."
5,I love this stuff,My husband and I both love this.I buy it at Walmart and it is deffinately cheaper.My Walmart has this at 2 for a dollar.
2,Works great for HED 3 Wheels but durability questionable,"I bought this upgrade kit so I could pump up my tires on my HED 3 wheels, which have a limited width of space to connect the nozzle onto the presta valve. It fit perfectly and locks on the valve very well. I also use it for my other set of wheels and it works great too. All around it works with probably all wheels from standard to aero wheels with deep rims. I have the Joe Blow Sport Pump and it connected very easily.--------update August 3 2012----------Unfortunately it doesn't attach anymore. The spring in it that I believe pushes back is completely jammed & I've tried everything to loosen it, with no success. Unfortunately this problem happened to me right before my triathlon making me scramble around for a crack pipe. Not sure if it's worth $20 for two years of occasional use. I'm really bummed as it used to work well. I'm not sure if I'm going to buy another one for my HED 3 wheels or if there is something better out there."
5,Topeak Smarthead,"Cannot comment on long term reliability but it has certainly worked perfectly out of the box (I bought it for use on Presta valves only). Goes on easily, clamps tight to make a good seal and unhitches without putting any strain on a fragile Presta."
1,Had much trouble on Schrader valve,"This clamp-on air chuck is solidly constructed of quality materials, but I think it must be poorly designed for the following reason. It is easy to push it onto a schrader valve too far so the lever won't lock in the up position, and you risk damaging the schrader valve if you try to force it. It is also easy to not push it on far enough so you don't get air into the tire. What is not easy is attaching it ""just right"" so it works. The sweet spot between these two extremes is so narrow that I hit it in only 1 out of 10 tries. From now on I am using a screw-on air chuck (as on Lezyne pumps) and have found them to be much much less hassle. ToPeak makes good pumps, I just wish they made a screw-on air chuck."
1,Avoid,got this as a replacement for a bad hose on my old Zefal pump. Works poorly on schrader valves i.e. doesn't reliably press the valve so that when you pump you just pressurize the hose w/o putting air in the tire. I am putting it in the dumpster. Didn't need the presta ability anyway.
3,Not all I wanted it to be.,"Fits in my pocket and has some info, but nothing this compact can have everything. Not as much on differential diagnosis, but it gives me a place to start. As with most of medicine, you end up reading more in other books anyway."
5,Yummm,"Smelly like bubble gum. I use this for air refresher in my car. Does last very long, but this comes with a LOT. The colors looks more like brown instead of pink. But you can't see it when you spray it."
3,SHOTGUN SLADE,"this is fun watching bbut not even close to roy or gene or any of the tv b western heros ,he has a gimic a shot gun sawed off and he is a stocky man and some of the stories are good! buy it used and no more than 5-7 dollors ,it's not worth more than that !"
4,Duetto Chemical Filter,Unable to locate this product locally without calling or driving all over the island. Received what was needed and timely.
3,backporch Sonic Youth,"For certain it has little to do soundwise w/ Fahey's more traditional guitar stylings, but plenty of assocation and reference to his earlier experiments in musique concrete. Sounds like some weird cross between Derek Bailey and John Cage maybe. I especially enjoy the opening overture, which sounds like Fahey jamming with an old noisy refrigerator motor. This CD is grating at times but I've got a lot of respect for Fahey for announcing his 'comeback' with such a thoroughly uncompromising disc of new material."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY,Whatever this is it is absolutely unlistenable. I can't give it away. I have some of Fahey's earlier work which is fabulous. I lost touch with his work and actually kind of forgot about him. Then I heard the stories of his illness and his mental breakdown. Well evidentally it's all true if this is any indication. The liner notes are but a small peek into what it must be like to be Fahey as he rants on about being missunderstood. Is it any wonder? Instead of buying this may I suggest you slam your head in a car door about seven times. You'll enjoy it much more than you would listening to seven seconds of this.
5,Ultra Brutal Gore,"The Burning Moon is an unbelievably gory splatter film from German Director Olaf Ittenbach. In the movie a little girls older, drug addicted brother tells her horrifying bedtime stories filled with some of the most over the top splatter ever seen. I have seen many gruesome splatter movies and this one is definitely near the top of the list. The scene in hell is so gruesome and horrific that it has to be seen to be believed.I highly suggest buying The Burning Moon if you're a fan of hard core gore."
1,Total Garbage...,"I rented this movie back in 2003. No budget, shot with a camcorder. The worse acting ever seen, the gore was plentiful but cheaply done. The gore could not save this film from utter crapville. Unbearable to sit through due to the story, acting, and production. I fast forward to the ""Hell scene"" and it takes place in someone's basement! No fire and brimstone or pits of suffering, just concrete walls and pipes! Necromantik is the only German gore film worth seeing. Stick to your Fulci and Savini classics, avoid this one..."
1,This schlock actually has fans???,"Burning Moon is a spectacular failure in every way possible. The story tries to ape an anthology with 2 spooky stories being told, but they both are crappy and in the main arc a brother kills his sister, while, telling her... the stories??The acting is a joke, the gore effects could be done better by a 10 year old with a red paint bucket, the mini-stories themselves are really uninteresting and drag out which is the last thing an anthology should do. The infamous hell scene? What a joke, you see people with some fake blood on them laying around (probably drunk) and then some drill goes into cheap prosthetics bought at party city.The few people who gave this 5 stars were probably the actor's mothers, if you're into these kind of films watch something that doesn't suck, like the Guinea Pig series or August Underground Mordum, there's a reason no one ever mentions this pile of pig s***."
1,What a Load of Crap,"This movie is horrible horrible horrible. It's only got the hype it does because it's so ""extreme"" and because it was banned back in the early 90's in Germany. This movie has no production value (except for the gore which is overall decent quality), no discernible plot (it's just an excuse to get from one gore scene to another), and no redeeming qualities. Really, the only people that I would recommend this flick to are hardcore gorehounds that like gore just for the sake of gore, because that's all THE BURNING MOON is. Horrible. That's time I'll never get back."
1,Could have been a gore classic.....,"if it were made back in the 60's but this film was shot in the 90's!! As others have stated; the acting is horrible, the story is so-so and the f/x are laughable, especially for the year it was made! People who are so in love with this (seriously 5 stars for this) must have never seen real exploitation from the 70's or gore films from the 60's or maybe they don't realize when this was made!? This is pure dreck and should be avoided at all costs! If it were a feature from the 60's/70's I could overlook a lot of things and maybe give it a 3 star but as it is I'd actually give it no stars if I could! Definitely check outclips on Youtube before blind buying based on someone else 's misguided hype for this!"
2,No Budgie here,"This 2 disc live CD is listed under Budgie but there are zero songs by Budgie on this release.As a service I will give the track listing from the back cover.Disc 11. Golden Earing - Long Blonde Animal2. Girlschool - Race with The Devil3. Steve Forbert - School Girl4. Humble Pie - Honky Tonk Woman5. Uriah Heep - Easy Livin6. Blackfoot - Wishing Well7.

4,Good toy bad relationship,"I got this teddy bear for my then girlfriend, it was really soft and cuddly,i really liked the bear, but the girl I got it for turned out to be a whoreable person, i liked the bear, i just wish i got it for a better person."
2,Strange Edition!!!But NICE,"Strange because this edition should contains the same tracks as in the vinyl and don't!!!There are 9 tracks in vinyl edition and this CD contains just 6 tracks.Following tracks is lacking in this CD:1-Country Pie/Bradenburg Concerto N.62-One of those People3-3rd Movement,Pathetique Symphony.Besides,in the back-cover is writed:""This CD contains material previously available on the albums Five Bridges and Elegy"".It's a lie!Now I wish to know:WHY?Does someone knows the answer?I think is better buy Elegy and Five Bridges separately.It contains all material mentioned lacking in this CD."
4,The B3,"Buy this CD for the best live playing of a Hammond B3 in the history of mankind. Much here is a bit lame, but Keith on the B3 in ""America"" is the reason to own this."
5,awesome,"every track makes you want to sing and dance. great selection of song with diverse backgrounds. the kids love it same for us, the parents."
5,Great CD!,"I've been trying to listen to ""kids'"" music that isn't boring or annoying. The CD's we listen to include this one, French Playground, and the Caspar Babypants CDs which I highly recommend!"
5,Putumayo rocks!,"I love having this for my little one to listen to at bed time. It's not my favorite cd from them, that would be world playground, which I used to play all the time for dancing at the child care center I worked at. I like that it includes a booklet with translations and also songs in creole french!"
2,Lyrics not appropriate for very young children,I am a French mother and I don't like this CD very much. The music is fine but some lyrics are simply not appropriate for very young children. I think that some of the songs were not initially written for children and it shows. Putumayo should have done a better job at selecting the songs.
3,this cant be mobb deep,"cmon what a big let down. this cant be the same mobb deep that gave me quiet storm and shook ones. what happen pee and hav?? i thought i can count on these guys to give me the real hip hop music just like nas did. i guess nas was right when he said ""I'm The Last Real Nigga Alive"" im waiting to Street Disciple to drop. for now. get the mobbs old hits like Hell On Earth, Murda Muzik, and The Infamous."
4,Dope,"Although the beats were a little on the ""radio friendly"" side I think its the best stuff they have released in quite a few years."
3,go buy it,"This is a decent album. P and Havoc really step up lyricly on this one. The beats are not that good. The best songs are got it twisted, win or lose, when u hear the, and one of ours pt. 2.Go support them."
3,Mobb Deep needs to give up,Haven't dropped anything hot since shook 1's . This album is ok the best song is flood the block and Got it twwisted Remix. And now they r the biggest sellouts signing to 50 because they can't return to the once infamous form .
3,Modd deep has a ok album.,"Modd deep has a ok album. Good enough to a 3 out of 5. Good tracks like dump with nate dogg,Real ganstaz with lil jon and . Got It Twisted Remix featuring Twista."
2,these guys are turning pop,"the last album i found worthy to listen to at least a verse of was murda muzik. on infamy they started doing soft songs, and now they're rollin with g-unit? come on..."
1,Midgets... These lil b*tches are plain weak...,"Mobb sleep, as i like to call them ? Are weak and their album ""amerikaz nightmare"" is pure garbage and belongs in the trash because? First the production is weak the lirycs idiotic and their flow is pathetic...Plain & simple and now that they're with gay unit on 50's latest video like groupies--acting like"" hey look at me, im here dancing like a little girl in a 50 video"" Come on !IL just becaurfull when i walk down the street i dont step on these mobb sleep 4 ft midgets! Lmao! I heard mobb deep was friends with the brady bunch. Don't waste your money on this mainstreem trash. Support 2pac & outlaws,rassk kass, underground sh*t."
1,Waste of $$$$$,"I cant believe i brought this garbage. I thought this cd was going to be tight but its WACK!!!! there's only two good songs on here and to make it bad its THEIR HITS!!!!Mobb deep need to work on their rapping skills. IT'S ALL ABOUT 2PAC!!!! And if anyone got a problem, then come to Miami-Dade and WE CAN HANDLE IT!!! f*ck Mobb Deep"
4,Sell outs!,"Aight so the latest Mobb album is definitely one of the best of 2004. Most Mobb fans say it's not as good as their first 2 albums but having not heard them i can't compare this to them which is a good thing. So here's an honest review: Virtually all the songs are tight with only a few songs that i wan't feeling like 'shorty wop'. What is the point to that song? But enywayz it is a great album and if ur a rap fan it's worth gettin for sure. The guest appearances are good aswell wit Jada, Nate Dogg and Twista. This is not compared to previous Mobb albums and IMO gets a 4/5.Top 5:One Of Ours Pt 2Real NiggazGot it TwistedAmerikaz NightmareWin Or Lose"
1,Sell outs...,"Lets face it...Mobb deep gone way soft and they dont do hard songs anymore or even undeground songs but only readio friendly music with pop rappers and i wont be surprised if they made a song with nsync or backstreetbous... I mean, the reality is? Mobb deep's last good album was hell on earth but after that? They've turned pu*sy. Skip ameriakaz nightmare cuz lil john is in this! Worse producer of all times."
3,Ok.,"K Flatt ""The Rap Grader"" <-------- ROFL... is an idiot. Its Mobb Deep, not Modd Deep dumbass. How can you call yourself a rap grader and spell the artists name wrong?Before you really get into this CD, get Infamous or Hell on Earth. Infamous is their best one IMO."
2,I'm disappointed...,"Man, what the hell is this? This isn't Mobb Deep. I didn't except a new Imfamous or Hell on Earth...but a good album! And I can say this isn't one!!!Trust me!"
3,Nihil Novi !!!!!,1. Amerikaz Nightmare - 3.52. Win Or Lose - 4.53. Flood The Block - 44. Dump - 3.55. Got It Twisted - 56. When U Hear The - 57. Real N***az - 1(BORING!!!)8. Shorty Wop - 3.59.

BONUS 1 Bustin Ya Hammer - 418. BONUS 2 We Don't Love Em - 3.5
3,Shallow.........Mobb,I love Mobb but this was not one of their better efforts definately not the caliber of Free Agents which was just phenonmenal. I believe the problem is in the production. Most of this joint was the same ole same. Alchemist is not what he has been put up to be in my opinion. I will always be a supporter of Mobb and Prodigy is my man.
4,Real NY Hip Hop back at it...,"Them Mobb deep boys out QB projects come thru again wit the hard hittin Amerikaz Nightmare. Not classic MD... but a good taste of what hip hop is missen these days. This Cd comes with the grimiest beats out right now, just plain sick. Mobb Deep delievers their usual, now i see why they amerikaz nightmare... they murdered a few thousand ppl in this CD lol.But im just happy to see the realness back at it, none that 50 cent BS. Best song on the CD i think is win or loose, tight hook and just the back n forth kills the track. So im given this CD the 4 stars cuz is probably one of two good CD's out in this moment along with Jadakiss Kiss of Death."
5,HOTTEST HIP HOP CD I'VE HEARD IN YEARS!!!,"IF YOUR A HIP HOP FAN, AND DON'T HAVE THIS, YOU AINT A FAN. THIS IS THE HOTTEST CD OUT RIGHT NOW. BEAT WISE, MIGHT BE THEIR BEST CD YET, BUT THE LINES ARE STILL ON POINT."
4,M-O-B-B get another one,"although i am getting alittle tired the gangsta rap that they always constantly rap about the beats seem to be the best part of their album like got it twisted, win or lose, real gangstaz, and when u hear the. i def think this is one of their best albums"
2,the title of this album coudln't be more fitting!,Another legendary rap group or rapper to fall off in 2004! Mobb was bragging about the 10 mill deal they got with jive now it blows up in they face! Got It Twisted had some decent buzz but mobb's lack of pull at the label prevented this album to come out when it was hot. Kanye West provides the best track on this album which should of been a single. Other than that this album is pretty bland with mobb switching they style to appeal to the commerical fans that wouldn't buy them anyway. Prodigys lyrics drop to a all time low as well on this album. I guess the sickel cell is really getting to him cause for some reason he still thinks he is ill. If it's not apparent this album was a failure just look at mobb now they all broke up. They took out there frustration on poor alchemist as he got beat down and their great manager littles left them to continue his own lacking career. RIP mobb deep maybe havoc will now get the shine he deserves!
4,Quite possibly the best album of '04 thus far,"'04 has been a very disappointing year thus far in hip-hop. Although Streets Disciple and Fabolous have yet to drop, ""Amerikaz Nightmare"" is the best album thus far in 2004. Shyne's ""Godfather Buried Alive"" definently met and exceeded expectations since it was not tampered with as much of the late great 2pac's music was. These two along with AZ ""Final Call,"" the Terror Squad album, and various mixtapes are the only albums to stay in constant rotation, otherwise it is strickly old-school flavor. On another note, as far a consistency from album to album being a group Outkast and Mobb Deep are the epitomy. Both groups from album to album have always had a solid, time-tested, and consistent sound. Not to make this review too long as many are, most of the readers just want a brief reason why they should or should not by the album, but the album is very hot overall, definently consistent with the sound of previous Mobb Deep albums. P.E.A.C.E"
3,Ok,I am a true Mobb Deep fan but they were just trying to much on this one to be club I wished certain ones wouldnt do that but the Cd is Good but my favorite was the hardcore and grimey Hell on earth
1,Mobb falls off,"Mobb deep used to be very good. ""The Infamous' and ""Hell on Earth"" are both excellent. But this new album, ""Amerikaz Nightmare"", what the hell happened? Lil Jon? Twista? These aint rappers.Generally this CD is terrible. I thought I would give it a chance even knowing by the way the CD name was written, it would probably be mainstream. If you like mainstream hip hop, buy this. If you like old mobb deep and wat is left of proper hip hop, do not waste your time."
4,Mobb Deep will never fall off,"You would think after all this time Mobb Deep would start to fall off, this is not the case on Amerikaz Nightmare. Hav and Prodigy bring. with there skills and great production this Cd is great. only a few guest appearances from Jadakiss, Big Noyd, Twista, Nate Dogg, and Lil Jon. it has standout tracks like ""Win Or Lose"", ""Got it Twisted"", ""Real Niggaz"", and ""Throw your Hands In The Air"". Cop this CD fo sho!"
2,Nah...,"I love Mobb Deep's older stuff, and I don't expect them to create completely dope albums every time they come out with one, but this one didn't do it for me. Too commerical, like a lot of rap these days. I like ""Win or Lose"" and the Kayne West song, but the rest just seems like ""yeah yeah, new album...whatever. now give us our money"".Every group changes over time, but it seems like nowadays, good rap just turns to pop. But I guess thats just how todays culture works.I highly recommend The Infamous and Hell on Earth over this."
2,average at best,Mobb Deep at one time actually took some risks.but this Album has predictable Production&the Lyrics don't take them anywhere. this album seems run of the mill.I haven';t felt there stuff for quite some time now.I gotta wonder if they still feel it or are just going through the motions.
3,"Great pump for mountain bike tires, okay pump for road bike tires","This pump comes with a pounds-per-square-inch meter, which is really handy for getting the right pressure in your tires. If you're going for something like 35psi, you're golden. My road bike tires, however, want 110 - 120psi, and this pump just doesn't like that. Once you reach about 75psi, this thing does NOT want to pump anymore. I have to literally jump, fall and push down upon the handle with all my weight multiple times to bring the pump up 5psi at a time after reaching this point. If you're patient and don't mind the arm workout, this pump will do the trick in all cases. But if you want something easier, you may want to look elsewhere."
2,Beyond 50psi is a workout,"I am one of the few who probably received a defective one beyond 50 psi. I order this back in December 2011 / January 2012. In the beginning of this year, I had a mountain bike so it wasn't too bad inflating the tires. I recently built two road bikes and inflating my road bike tires to 100psi is so much work. I have to use all my weight and more when the tires reach 85 psi...I wonder if Amazon will replace this item after 6 months of usage..."
4,Comes in handy!,"I wanted a tire pump with a gauge, did quite a bit of comparison shopping and decided on the JoeBlow. I had quite a bit of trouble getting the nozzle attached to my bike tire, then reading the gauge. But when my husband came out one morning to drive to work and found his tire flat, he grabbed that JoeBlow and then thanked me for getting it! He taught me how to use it; now I'm glad I bought JoeBlow!"
1,no stars here!,"it doesn't work, its made for an entirely different style of tubbing and they don't explain that in their notes."
4,One of the best for the $$,"People have posted some reviews about having difficulty pumping to > 100 psi. I haven't had this (or any other) problems with the pump. For the money, I think this is the best bike pump out there. I have even had to return two previously for issues. I can't comment on its durability since I've only had it for one season, but it certainly does the job up to 110 psi."
4,Multi Use Pump,"This is the second Topeak pump (portable pump for bike) that I have purchased and both have fit expectations. The floor pump was longer than expected but was manageable. I have used the pump for various inflations (bike, farm trailer, tiller) and it has work very well. I have check the mounted guage against a digital guage and it is fairly accurate within usually 3 pounds. The locking knob works well and releases without lost of much air. The only improvement would be a better base since the plastic feels a little thin. Price was a positive factor and I would purchase it again."
1,Company says Label Misprinted.... NOT a 120 psi pump!,"Called the company when I had trouble getting more than 90 PSI from this pump. They told me that the label was misprinted! This is a 90 PSI MAX pump, not the 120 PSI printed on the label. These pumps should be recalled!Also, the connector is a pain. It's difficult to connect a presta valve compare to others I've used (Cannondale)."
5,Max air,"This pump does the job! I'll admit that I've only used it to pump up the tires on my Trikke cambering vehicle, which, because of their high pressure requirements (90 psi) and small diameter (12 inches), require a topping off periodically. Before Max II I would struggle using a worn out bicycle pump and spend about 15 minutes for the 3 tires, since a lot of air would leak out of them as I removed the hose connection. With Max II, I don't have that problem due to the efficient seal mechanism. Also, I only have to use about 4 to 5 pump actions to get the tires up to 90 psi, whereas I would work up a sweat with my old pump.Max II's pressure gauge seems to be quite accurate when I check the results with my digital gauge.I haven't used it for auto or bicycle tires, but it really works great for my Trikke. Also, the storage for extra needles on the base is handy and the clip for the hose makes it easy to carry."
2,too hard to use,"I have used the pump that is a step up from this one and have had no trouble getting my tires to 85 psi. I was not able to comfortably use this one; apparently the barrel is a little bigger, which means it pushes more air, and therefore is harder to use. It is probably ok for people of above average strength."
2,Not very accurate,Good thing I'm coupling this with a pressure guage anyways because the pressure guage on this is about 5 psi off.
3,not for road bikes,The pump is nice for the price but don't consider it if your want to pump up your roadbike tires above 100psi. I'm 165 lbs and my feet come off the ground just to get it up to 115 psi. For my mountain bike it works just fine to 80 psi.
2,had sealing issue with short stem valves.,"had sealing issue with short stem valves. I wanted to use this for all of our bikes, but with my kid's bike I found it to be difficult to seal on the stem. I'm not sure if this is more of a product issue or just my desire to have one pump fits all."
4,So far so good.,My son loves it. It gets used daily. I like the idea of being to replace the hose. I think this was a good purchase.
4,good for the price,"A little hard to pump above 60 psi otherwise made well, and great for the price..."
3,Mixed Bag,"I've had this pump for about a month.Pumps up tires/tubes with Shrader valves OK.The Presta valve side of the twin head does not work properly with short stemmed Presta valves. It seems that the pump nozzle has difficulty in forming a good seal with short stemmed Presta valves. The pump will only pump up to around 75 PSI into the tire/tube. Pressures beyond 75 PSI appear to ""seal"" the valve, which prevents further tire/tube inflation. The extra pressure just pressurizes the pump hose only!Pumping to higher pressures is a bit difficult. Especially when compared to easier working pumps such as Specialized and Blackburn brands which I have also.Overall it is an average pump.Not recommended for use with short stemmed Presta valves."
1,"Joe Blow Max ""Blows""","I've had a Joe Blow Sport pump for 5+ years and it was great. Decided to get a 2nd pump, one for home & family use and one to leave in the car. Based on my old pump & positive general Joe Blow reviews, I bought a Joe Blow ""Max"" from the LBS last week, and it blows !Once I get up to 80 psi, I really have to LEAN on it for each stroke to get up to 110. I mean my feet just about lift off the ground ! (I weigh 170)I got my old Joe Blow pump out and tried it ... zip zip zip right to 110 no problem.I am on my way back to the shop to return it."
1,"Valves Are Bad, Replace Every 3 months","I've gone through 3 Joe Blow pumps in 9 months. The overall pump is sturdy but the valve falls apart with only minor use in a very short period of time. Lucky for me my local bike shop let me swap them out for free. It's really a crying shame that this company doesn't get it, the valves are just cheap plastic and not on par with the rest of the pump."
5,no problems,"I have only used it once, but it worked great and had no problems, it is a very sturdy heavy duty product it seems like it will definitely last for years"
1,not for road bikes,"Originally bought this pump for my mountain bike and it works fine. Have also used it to fill my car tires and works well on them too although takes a ton of relatively easy pumps. Last month bought a new road bike and after my first ride and a few days in the garage tried to bring the tire back up to 100+ psi. OMG, I weigh 200 lbs. and after the first 95 it is so hard to get anything else its almost not worth the effort. If I put all my weight into it and literally lift my feet off the ground with each pump I can get a additional 1 lb. Multiply this stressful effort times 25 pumps and I can finally get 125psi. This pump is garbage for road bike needing anything above 100psi. DONT BUY!!!!"
2,Requires Excessive Pressure,"This pump requires excessive pressure to pump, even at low pressure. At first I thought I had a bad presta valve on my tube, so I didn't return it. Sadly, it exhibits this behavior on all bikes. I've used the next model up (friend owns) and it is much easier to pump. I wish I bought that one. Big disappointment with this. Two stars because it is functional."
2,Best yet - not,"I've used quite a few pumps over the years. I must say I am very pleased with this unit. I'm not sure how long it will last. It's mostly made of plastic so don't abuse it but functionally, it works great. It gets a tight seal with little effort and releases smoothly.Update: after having used this pump for several years I can report it still works okay; however, the plastic threaded fitting where the tube connects to the pump has failed. I managed to get it back on but it's very weak. If the fitting was made of more durable material this would not be a problem but as it's rather soft plastic it's a failure waiting to happen.Update#2: As predicted the fitting has failed completely. I tried using some pipe thread tape to make it work but the tube kept blowing off the fitting when under pressure. It is now history after less than 3 years of light use."
4,Needs a little elbow grease,"I am pretty happy with this pump, especially considering all I had before was a little hand pump. Using the presta valve side, I pumped up to 80psi very quickly. Getting up to 100psi took a LOT of effort. I put all 130lbs of my body weight into it and it was extremely difficult, but I got there. I am ok with this because it's a lot easier than my hand pump. Also, I haven't come across any pumps that go to 100+ psi with ease."
2,Presta side is useless,"Like P. Bahniuk said in his review, I had a hard time getting this pump to go any further than about 80 psi on my Presta valve tires. It felt as same or worse then pumping up a tire with a portable bike pump. Needless to say this pump is useless for my needs.Other then this the pump looks solid and very well built, but I can't say much about its durability since I'm returning it the same day I got it.Again if you have a Presta valve tubes, don't take a chance with this pump. move on to something known to work fine with Prestas."
2,Use your mouth-it's easier,"I rarely write reviews but wanted to spare folks the time and expense of ordering this pump. I will be brief and to the point. I am a serious cyclist and buy good equipment. When my old pump gave out- I jumped on Amazon to get a new one- fast !! This one seemed like it would work- dual head, 120 psi max etc. Here's the deal. The dual head is weak and very hard to fit. The lock lever is awkward to use. If you require 120 psi- you are going to have to jump on this to get it there ! This is at best a pump for the beach cruiser and even then the head really makes pumping your tires up more of a task than it needs to be. If you have kids bikes or a beach cruiser- save your self some $$ and go to Walmart. If you are a cyclist- this pump is not for you. Went to my LBS and purchased a serious pump with 160 psi max and smart head for about the same price-works like a dream. Now I have to spend $$ shipping this one back."
1,Plastic Junk,"Bought one of these a few months ago and it's been hanging in the garage waiting for me to need to use it. Due to an injury I have not been riding my bike.So today I *try* to use it for the first time. The stupid plastic screw-on ring on the Schrader side of the valve broke as I was operating the locking lever. Of course all the air was let out of my tire by the time!Don't buy! Total junk! This plastic valve is a weak link in what seems to be an otherwise OK pump design.I submitted a ticket with the manufacturer. Depending on how they respond, I will update my rating."
2,Worked well until it started leaking,"I used this pump for about a 1/2 year until it started leaking, Now I can't get any air at all into my tires."
2,bulky,"Definetly heavy duty, but its bulky. That makes it hard to store and use at times. Make sure you have enough room between the spokes of whatever you are pumping up. For example, the nozzle is too bulky to fit in between the spokes of our stroller. Works fine for the bike. If I had bought an old school pump for [...] I would not have to buy a second one for the stroller."
1,Worst pump I've owned.,"This was the first Topeak product I've owned and it will be the last. The pump states that it is rated up to 120 psi, but it really maxes out around 65 psi even though the gauge says anything higher. For presta valves the head is nearly useless. I bought this pump to use with my road bike, but ended up buying an adapter so I could use this pump's Schrader head. Overall it was a waste of money and I plan on contacting the manufacture."
2,pump does not live up to brand name,This pump was fine until wear and tear took its toll. Then the hose came off. When putting it back together it was never the same. It did not hold pressure after that. The guage was never accurate. 5lbs off from day one. Then a plastic piece that connects to the barrel broke and the whole thing ended up in the trash after 6 months of use. You get what you pay for $28.
2,Nice Features but Poor Construction,"I have had many pumps in the past where there is an auto sensing nozzle for presta and schrader valves which fails very quickly. I have had a Ravx and Blackburn Air Tower 2 which I replaced the nozzle with the Joe Blow TopPeak Twin Head replacement and love it. I needed another pump and since this seems to be the only brand with the twin head, purchased this pump. Immediately when I received it, I noticed that it was a very poor construction. Be warned, you get what you pay for, or maybe less with this model. The plastic base wobbles and the air gauge is inadequately attached to the pump. It is suspended from the base, but in no way fixed to the pump at the top and twists. Had I known this ahead of time, I would not have made this purchase and looked for another model or brand."
5,More than anticipated,American Primitive is definitely a collection of work that reflects the passions and obsessions of John Fahey. Thank God it got done.
1,Broke after 2 months and only has a 30 day warranty,"Title says it all. Three of the six caster holders on the base of the chair have broken in approximately 2 months. These are little plastic rings molded into the base that you put the stem of the caster wheel into. This results in the caster wheels falling out of the chair base and makes the chair both unsafe and uncomfortable. The only way to repair this is to replace the bottom star on the chair. However, since we are beyond the ridiculously short 30 day warranty we were told we would have to buy another lower half ($25 plus S&H). Bottom line you get what you pay for. We will not be repairing this chair since I can only imagine that it would break again in short order. Spend a little more for a quality product and do not buy this chair."
2,butchered,This was a miniseries but was cut down to 90 minutes. It is missing a lot of critical scenes & there are a lot of plot gaps. I was disapointed. I bought this to see what I missed when I saw it on tv & ended up seeing even less of the movie on this dvd.
3,dark and gritty,"It was much darker than I expected, but I actually enjoyed it, cared for the characters. Especially the young cop in the middle of it all torn between family loyalty and his job. I admit watching it because it's an early Stana Katic movie and I wasn't disappointed with her part. She brought hope and light to the movie and the young cop's life."
2,not what I expected,Great workbook for teachers with quizzes (though no answers) and other resource information that can be printed and copied for class. This is not a book for a lone grammerian in training.
4,Turtle Aquarium,Unable to locate the product here without having to place calls and drive all over the island. Just what was needed. Receipt was timely.
3,purple passions,this item came through the mail wonderfully not one broken leaf. i will certainly buy from this seller again. his prices are great you definitely get your moneys worth
4,Purple passion,"Bought this for my boyfriend who has been wanting one but could not find it locally. It was in fair condion when it arrived. The soil was intact but dry and the plant was a bit wilted, but perked up when watered. Beautiful plant."
2,passion,plant arrived on time was not as big as pictured other wise plant is still living growing good recomend purchase
4,purple passion plant,"the plant arrived in good condition and is growing nicely, I am going to get ready to transplant intoa bigger pot, It was a nice size."
2,Not worth Ordering,I thought this was going to be a beautiful and unique Plant. I was very dissatisfied when it arrived. It was small almost dead and dried out. I put it in a pot to nurture it back to life without any luck. It looks more like weed rather than an exotic Plant. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE !!!!!!
4,Thomas Percy & The Dragon,This is a great video! The only story on this tape that is boring is Edward's Exploits. I recomend it to all kids who don't own this tape.
4,Surprisingly good,"Here's a great, rare adventure set in the world of Conan's Hyperborea, and featuring some of Clyde Caldwell's best illustrations of all time - Red Sonja! This dark, gritty adventure (for levels 10-14) will see your PCs battle their way through many classic foes - Sotha the Magus, the Succubus, and much more as they quest in search of the lost treasures of Marcol. Easily adapted to a Greyhawk campaign, and surprisingly well-written - a lost classic!"
2,I really wanted to like this book...,"The problem with killing your main character off in the first chapter is that it usually doesn't leave room for much of a climax in the end. I wanted to like this book, it's a great concept! The first chapter is very gripping, however, I just wasn't impressed with anything that followed. While the book is short, it seems repetitive and boring. Furthermore, the characters are very distant and unconvincing. While the entire book is spent following Chuy's ghost and listening to his thoughts and feelings, I never get a feeling of who he really is/was. Another downfall of this book is all the Spanish words thrown into it. Luckily there is a glossary included in the back, but since I *had* to know the meaning of every Spanish word I came across, I was constantly flipping to the back of the book. While it's interesting to study languages and cultures, I don't really think the words added anything to the book and they slowed down the flow of the story."
3,Not as good as it sounds,"The Afterlife by Gary Soto seems like a really twisted, new book from the review, but after reading the first few chapters you get bored. Everything seemed to take forever to happen, and the book really isn't that long. Chuy, the main character, is also pretty boring. True, he tells us about his life when he was alive and the neat things he did, but he whines a lot and he just isn't someone you would care about. He doesn't pop out of the book like some main characters do. What I did like about the book was the writer used spanish words added a glossary. Take it out of the library if you still want to read it, buy don't buy it."
2,The Afterlife,"Okay it isn't like I hated the book, but I could think of other ways to spend my time. It isn't just that the main character dies at the beginning of the book, but that the story is so unrealistic. Do you really think after you die you will fall in love? I think if a reader is old enough to understand that this book is just a fantasy then it would be okay, but for younger readers it might give them the idea that death is better than living."
5,Not every author kills character first!!!!!!!!!,"As you have read in most books authors kill them in the last pages of the book but not Gary Soto. Thats what makes this book so special he writes things from a dead persons point of view or what he thinks it would be like being a ghost. I really liked this book. There was a ix of a little bit of everything. Love, death, awesome writing. Chuy meets this girl names Crystal who he falls in love with. He meets her beccause she had died too. In the book Chuy learns an important lesson. He learns that his family and freiends loved him a lot when he thought they didnt even reconzie him before. So reda this and find out what happens!!!"
3,Good read,Easy read and nice flow to the story. Make a person understand what forgiveness is and how your family finds it hard to be at piece with your death.
4,The Afterlife by Gary Soto,"I read this novel while studying Latino authors for a multicultural project. To begin with, this novel was the first one I read by Gary Soto and I really enjoyed it. The novel kept my attention and upon reflection I can see how Soto's love of poetry influences his writing.The Afterlife vivid imagery places the reader in the setting. The reader can almost expereince the smells and the sounds of the city. I believe the story started off strong but the conclusion of the novel is weak. Questions are left unanswered. Some of Soto's other works such as his short stories in Baseball in April offer stronger resolution and are more satisfying. Still, I recommend The Afterlife for young adult readers. The themes of friendship, compassion and romance will keep young readers interested in the outcome."
3,The Afterlife,"The Afterlife by Gary Soto was a fascinating book. In the story, a man with yellow shoes has murdered Chuy. The book is about Chuy, and his thoughts and actions in the afterlife. Now being a ghost, he can pass through buildings and people, but his touch leaves behind a cold chill. The story is fascinating because you feel sorry for him, and his lost life. You can understand his emotions. Chuy is an average kid who tries to do good in his afterlife, to make things better for at least one person. It is also about his meeting with other ghosts and the impacts he has on them. I liked this book because it makes you think about what you would do as a ghost. The story was really well told, and Gary Soto puts you into the life of this kid. I recommend this book to anyone who can stand blood and gore, but likes a happy ending. It was a great read and you don't want to put it down until you've finished."
2,you get what you pay for,"subwoofer should not be called that: it's tiny, and distorts if the slightest bass is put through it. Not good for music, not good for gaming. Steer clear."
3,"3"" ported woofer = not much practical utility","Fine for basic listening, but not ok for movies, etc, because if you turn them up loud enough to hear speech, when low bass sounds come along the subwoofer starts distorting."
5,fantastic sound,When I plugged these speakers in and put on a DVD. I was amazed in how much the sound quality improved. You get the surround sound quality you get in theatres. You just have to place the speakers in the right places in the room. Playing my MP3's is great on this. This is a great addition if you are looking for speakers for your computer.
2,You get what you pay for.,"The description of these speakers is slightly wrong, they are not actually flat panel speakers. They are regular speakers placed to look like flat panel speakers. The Bass is over empasised and there is no adjustment for it. If you are on a budget and just want a few speakers for proping your door open these are a great buy. Get two Bostons and you will thank me.Ed"
3,Good speakers for money,These speakers are an ok analog 4.1 system. I am pleased that the speakers do not hiss or make popping noises. They do have some distortion at higher volumes. This speakers lack bass power however the subwoofer submits a small amount of high quality bass that doesn't stick out in a bad way. These speakers have too much treble and not enough mid range as is common on many CA systems. The rear speakers are somewhat quiet. There is no subwoofer volumer control. ... Just be warned that there are many many better speakers systems. ...I do not regret buying these speakers as they are a nice addition to my 8.2 speaker mess :)
2,Good sound but bad volume nob,"This item has had a bad volume nob from the start, but I was so busy doing other things I was not able to return it to the store, and when I contact warranty support they say I have to ship in the whole unit. They cannot just send me a new nob because it is all wired together it does not work good. It goes from low to high in a short space or has static when I move the nob."
2,DOES NOT WORK AS 2.1 ON WINDOWS 7,"I bought these speakers several years ago and they work fine. The problem with using them for computer speakers is that they only output sound from 2 speakers with windows 7 audio drivers. I have tried everything and they only sound from the R and Sub speakers. Do not buy these if you are looking for cheap PC speakers, there are plenty of other cheap 2.0 speaker sets out there."
1,product description misleading,"I wanted to replace an older Cambridge Soundworks satellite system that happens to work with a 12 volt wall adapter. That makes it usable in a RV or, in my case, my boat where there is no 120 VAC available. When I looked at the specifications on the web page for this product, it lead me to believe that it comes with a 12 VDC wall adapter, but it came with a 120 volt standard cord."
1,Just plain sucks. never buy it,"Its sound, design really suck. Do not buy this item. There is no midrange sound, the buttons are cheap. It give sound it is ok but if you can call it as sound. If you are looking for a speaker system in this range buy Creative Inspire T3000. It is great. Never buy iy"
4,its ok,"the sound quality is great for this price.im not sure is this only me what or. When you turn on the speaker, it will make tiny noise or some sorta static sound?i dont know how to explain it. but it bugs me"
2,I gave them a try but i'll still with my old ones,"Staples had these for $15 so I thought I would try them out see if they were any better than my PC's OEM Speakers. My OEM speakers didn't have a woofer so i was excited to see the sound difference. Like other reviews have said all the bass comes from the woofer and all the treble from the fronts... i mean ALL though. The mids and highs sound terrible, not even a hint of lows from the two speakers so these only sound good if you are sitting across the room, but then they wouldn't be PC speakers.I know these are only $15 but I prefer my old cheap oem ones with no woofer because the mids and highs are decent and the lows are there but not profound. These are probably good to hookup to your gaming system to help if your TV doesn't produce good lows but for a ""PC"" setup... I don't recommend them."
2,"Cheap Price, Cheaper Sound.","These are bargain speakers, they are very inexpensive. Here's the thing, the sound like bargain speakers. They crack at high volumes. This is not simple distortion, this is staticky garbled noise. These speakers are adequte for most games, but the don't cut it for music, the trebles crack, and sound tiny. the base sounds empty and garbled. These are not good speakers, they are accepable for low fidelity, low volume listening and for minor sound effects, but anything beyond that is unaceptable."
1,Worked for a week.,"I bought these speakers to have a little better sound in a machinery room that I work out in. Before I used it in that workout room, I tried them in my bedroom for about a week. I was happy with them until one speaker stopped working if I had the sound turned down on the provided volume control. The speaker worked only when the sound was turned all the way up and when it was turned up both speakers you could hear static. Maybe mine was defective, but I am not going to recommend this. Spend a little bit more for something the same size."
4,More control better,"The sound quality is good and enough for a room. It looks nice. It only has a on/off and a volumn switch. Maybe other controls are not necessary since usually the computer and CD, MP3 players can take care them."
2,Just plain bad sound,"I bought these speakers to replace the very poor speakers that came with my system. I didn't want to spend too much for a new set, so I thought I would give the Cyber Acoustics a try.Well, I've learned my lesson, because these speakers sound even worse then my old pair. The base is overpowering and has an artificial pitch. Don't think that just turning the base down will help either; all you hear then is the loud hum it makes.The sound range says it is from 35hz - 20000hz, and that may be true. However, it sounds like the satellites are only 10000hz-20000hz and the subwoofer is 35hz-1000hz.I think you should stay away from any Cyber Acoustic PC speakers. They sound terrible; it's as simple as that."
5,awesome,"These are well worth the money. I had Locitech ones before and these blow them away in sound, and they were about 8 dollars more. defitionly a good buy very pleased."
3,"Pretty Good, for a decent price..","If your looking to purchase something small with a good sound then look no further. I can honestly say that Cyber Acoustic Speaker System is a good deal for a reasonable price. Now if your a person who luvs to blast music (like myself) then you'll soon learn that after a while your speakers wont last too long. So if your looking to save $ over Quality, I say go for it. However if your looking for a speaker system with better Quality & Power, you might wanna go for something else.."
5,Honest Review,"I picked up these speakers at the F.Y.E store for about 14 Dollars. I expected the quality to be crap also expected it to be crappy materials. So for what these speakers cost I am very satisfied i highly recommend for any students that live in dorms or people that don't want to spend a lot of money on technology. The quality is good, the bass is loud, and a big plus to this is that you can also plug in your iPod."
4,Nice beach building accessories,The reason these got 4 and not 5 stars is because i thought they were much bigger. in the picture they seem big but when we got them they are quite small. They are very nice for making SMALL castles and turrets - we use them for building ON TOP of what we have already built. I thought these would be good for the main structures when we build our sand castles but they are way too small to be the focus...very nice though for what they are. just small.
5,bought for visiting great grandchildren,"they had never had sand toys before that made castles so were intriqued and played with them for long periods of time...quite an achievement, to keep a 17 mnth and 4 yrs old busy...but they did the trick. Good value, great purchase."
4,Beach fun,These are exactly what youd expect and they do what you would want them to do. They are also a nice size. My son enjoyed them so yes Id recommend them to others.
2,Poor production,"Not impressed with this DVD. The production value is very poor. The video quality is pretty bad, the sound is not at all where it should, the editing is horrible! It was good to listen to all their songs again, but I would have rather purchased the CD than this."
4,OH NO SHE HAS SHORT HAIR !,IT'S A COOL CONCERT DVD OF ANA TORROJA AND MECANO I THINK THE YEAR IT'S FROM 91' OR 92' ANYHOW IT HAS GOOD SOUND AND CLEAR IMAGE IT GAS SEVERAL OF THEIR GOOD SONGS BUT THE REASON I GAVE IT FOUR STARS IS THAT SHE HAS SHORT HAIR !I WANTED TO SEE HER WITH LONGER SPONGIER 80'S STYLE LOOK BUT OVERALL IT'S A COOL DVD IF YOU LIKE ANA TORROJA OR MECANO GET IT FOR YOUR COLLECTION !
5,This is most Mothers and Fathers lives,"IF you are a stay at home mom and need some laughs get this book! Each page I just kept saying, ""That is how it is in my house!"" I felt like Wanda! Awesome book"
5,Great fun!,"I love the Baby Blues comics. The Our Server is Down scrapbook is my current favorite. As a mother of three, I can relate to just about everything in it. On days I need a pick-me-up, I can count on Baby Blues to give me a smile!"
5,GOOD,This book is the second book in the series and also a very good one it has some twist and some humor in it. After reading the first book Bloody Jack than you have to read this one. In this one Jacky is at Lawaon Peabody School For Young Girls.She has many difficulties fitting in with the girl there except for a few of them. She gets into a lot of troucle with the law and the school.Also some crazy guy is trying to kill her. In the end she knows that she is not meant to be a lady so she gets on a whaler and leaves Boston. It is an excelen book I am not one that is good at describing but it is a must read.
4,Great Adventure,"I would reccomend this book for sea going salts! It makes you wish you were living during that era, harsh as it was!"
5,The Voice of Jacky Faber,"As if the Bloody Jack books aren't delightful enough on the printed page, along comes Katherine Kellgren to absolutely sing them into life! She positively IS the very voice of Jackeroe herself and I will accept no substitute for further Bloody Jack narrations. What a fantastic ride these books are!"
5,Restful and meditative. I've heard it a hundred times,Very etherial. Takes you to a very peaceful and restful place in moments. A visionary work.
3,Nice Reproduction,"This is a nice reproduction of a book from c.1656 but I didn't find it helpful. I think I was hoping it would be more of the ""Brother Cadfael"" type knowledge. A better, modern book on herbs would be more useful and safer, too. But, as I said, it is an interesting book to have on the shelf."
5,An impressive first novel,"It is getting harder and harder to find books that are both well-written and uplifting. Usually one or the other is missing. I believe this is especially true of children's books. ""Safe At Home"" is a wonderful exception. It was an enjoyable read. And you would have to be a very jaded person not to be touched by the message. I am looking forward to reading more of Mr. Skead's writings."
3,"Though old, it still assisted",I wrote and past the i-Net+ (1K0-002) today (Mar-5-2004). This book contributed 60% of the content.Though the questions in the book assisted with the material of the book very very few actually came in the exam.The book help moreso with understanding the concepts.The exam was hard... damn hard. I passed with a 83% mark.
2,i-Net+ Cert Exam,"During my studying..I found 2 errors in the book...as in the past, I sent an E-mail the the mfg., This was approx. 3 weeks ago. I feel that this is enough time for a reply or aknowledgement.I would recommend alternative study material due to poor support from the mfg. of this material.Contents that where applicable to the i-Net+ exam where fair at best. The design of this book is for someone who has more knowledge than the author or reviewer, some material in the book was covered (which I appreciated); however, the most as most books should be directed towards a person at inter. level, not advanced. I passed the test with flying colors; however, little credit goes towards this book.Regards, Bruce_Freshwater@HotMail.Com"
5,The frantic student's friend!,"This book covers the points of the I-net+ exam in a very fast-paced ""Look, we already know you know some of this stuff, let's get over it quick and move on"" manner!I'm heading out to take my test in a couple of weeks and I'm fairly confident I'm going to pass! The pretest in the back of the book and the testing at each chapter made me go back and check out the information I needed to brush up on so I can pass the first time I take the exam (and at 190 dollars a pop for the exam... getting it right the first time is important)!If you don't have the time to sit and read everything there ever was on the internet, pick up this book!"
4,Good Overall Review Book,"used this book along with the cramsession pdf and as many online sample test as possible to study for the i-Net+ cert.only found one typo in the book and its on the review sheet at the front of the book. the Class A subnet mask lists 116K instead of 16 million.the questions at the end of the book are much simpler than the actual test questions.however, you'll get a good idea of the topics to be covered on the test from the book. actually the book covers more topics than the test itself.you'll find a few semi-verbatim questions on the actual test that the book has simply paraphrased, but that's about it for question similarities.i'd say this book will help you pass, but don't think it should be your only source for the cert.good luck."
4,One of the better Exam Cram Books,"After my experience with the Linux+ and Server+ Exam Crams I was ready to scrap this series all together. This book has partially restored my faith. I took the I-Net+ exam today and passed fairly easily and a good deal of the credit belongs to this book. About 30% of the material on my exam wasn't in this book but given that it is intended to be brief and concise, I feel that is acceptable. This should be a sufficient supplement to anyone looking to take this exam, provided you have a modest level of experience in the related technologies."
2,not for novices,"I was hoping for an accessible, easily understood explanation of the Buddhist take on the meaning of life. Instead I first got a very complex analysis of Buddhism which did not adequately prepare me for the transcibed speeches of the Dalia Lama which followed. Maybe I'm not smart enough to grasp Buddhism. It certainly seems like this tape was not produced for the novice but for the more advanced student of Buddhism. If so, the tape cover did not warn me of that."
4,EVERYTHING TO GAIN....from PEACE,If I could interview ANYONE living or dead it would be the Dalai Lama. A man who answers all of mans eternal questions of the purpose of living and the focus of life.Follow his teachings and find your own destiny and peace in your spirit.
4,"Worth the money, but...",I bought two of these and they both worked. I did have some problems with the mouse scrolling. It seemed to work only some of the time.
1,Do NOT buy this item from seller Amamax,"This item could be a good one, but not if you buy it from Amamax. The adapter shipped by this seller is NOT the same brand listed on Amazon (Syba). It is a cheap imitation which does not work properly (at least for me it didn't). When connecting two devices (a keyboard and a mouse) to the adapter, one is not being recognized. I have similar adapters of other brands (e.g. amazon product B00008ZPED), and they work flawlessly with the same devices. So the problem is obviously with with the adapter.Amamax is not only a dishonest seller, but was difficult to deal with when I wanted to return the item. I had to send multiple emails, and then they wanted me to call(!) to have the refund processed. I finally had to file a claim with Amazon. Stay away from this seller!"
1,buyer beware,You really get what you pay for here. Does not work and is not worth returning. Waste of time and money.
1,bought two & one worked,I know I didn't pay much. but when you buy something. You expect it to work. Spend more money on a good one!
5,Works on my PS3 in one USB port!,"I plugged in my old PC keyboard and mouse when I turned on my PS3, but in order for them to work I have to unplug my controller first, which is annoying but it's worth it though. It's also perfect for being environmental friendly by using wired accessories as well. Shipping is fast and takes approximately a week."
2,Not worth it,"I bought this product in January of 2012 and for 2 1/2 months it peformed very well. During the past 2-3 weeks, whenever I would attempt to type in my password, on the startup screen, nothing would appear in the password box whenever I typed. If I would disconnect this item and then re-connect it everything was back to normal. The problem is not the keyboard as I have tested other keyboards using this same device and resulting in the same problem. So the problem is this adapter. It was getting to be a PITA getting on the floor each time to disconnect and re-connect this adapter so I am getting rid of it. I could have written a favorable review a few weeks after I purchased it. I expect something brand new to work fine. It's how the product performs, in the long haul, which a review should be based on."
2,Does not accept barcode scanner input,Appears to work fine with a keyboard but does not accept barcode scanner input. Beeps but does not relay info as does a similar cable from another manufacturer. Haven't tried returning item ~ not worth the cost of shipping.
1,Did not work for me...,What a downer... After all the great reviews both of the adpaters I ordered would not work on either the mac mini or the Ubuntu 10.04 LTS machine. One of them when plugged into my Ubuntu machine triggered the machine to immediately go in sleep mode. I was hoping for just works but it looks like I'll be trying another brand.
2,Did not work with Windows 7,"I bought this from Million Accessories (via Amazon). Received quickly and it did work on a Vista PC (both KB and mouse), but not on 2 different Win 7 PCs, which was my main need.Million later confirmed in an email ""Support Windows 98/SE/ME/2000/XP/VISTA, not Window7""."
4,Necessity was the command,"We needed to buy this part, as many stores do not carry small items like the above, in order to install our new computer. After browsing though a number of Electronic Stores with no results, we bought from Amamzon.Very happy, works like a charm."
1,Did not work,Purchased this adapter to work with my KVM; it failed completely. Since I have no other use for this product it is useless to me.
2,Not worth the price,"I bought these headphones for my father for Christmas. He has some hearing problems so I thought this would be great for when he watches tv, so he doesn't have to blast the volume.Unfortunately, in order to hear throught the headphones, you have to turn the tv volume up. Poor design. Definitly not worth $100."
4,a little smokier than most kimchee but still tasty,"I bought this and slathered it on wilted salted napa cabbage, with scallions, ginger, and a litle chili paste added in. It wasn't as good as Korean store-bought Kimchee but it was better than big grocery store chain versions."
2,Truncated Songs,"Great selections and good recordings, but every song in this compilation is under 2 minutes. Many are simply faded out at inappropriate points; none of them are full versions Claydermann fans are used to. For example, shaving 40 seconds off of Ballade Pour Adeline is bad enough, but cutting out over 1 1/2 minutes from A Comme Amour is downright criminal."
5,"Must read volume 1, not stand alone volume","Drunvalo comes across very sincere and humble, but blessed with the knowledge to explain very complex subjects to regular people, like me. Are you ready?"
4,I like the book,"I like the book and enjoy learning about ratios and sacred geometry but he says he gets much of his ideas and info from Thoth who has been dead for thousands of years. When he says Thoth told me or Thoth said, I think what he's really saying is that he found out from someone who he can't name or that he guessed. Maybe some people would enjoy that more. Aside from that I like the books."
2,"""What is this ""Motley Crue"" of which you speak?""","Cinderella wishes it was Motley Crue...really really hard. But as hard as they wish, they can't come close. They have no speed, no hooks, and no talent. They look like Crue knock-offs, and sound like them too. There isn't really anything worth hearing on this album. Basically, the singer sounds like Bon Scott with laryngitis. That's the only thing that could be considered a plus. There isn't a single memorable song on here, just a lot of droning...yuck. Get some Crue, Ratt, whatever...just not this."
1,"""Dude Looks Like A Lady!""","Just a sorry excuse for an Aerosmith cover band with even your clone version of Steven Tyler only younger and with less talent. Glittery clothes; more makeup than Madonna; 10,000 dollar hair extensions; and close to zero talent sums up what this band is all about. Steven Tyler must have had this band in mind when he wrote 'Dude Looks Like a Lady.' What made Hollywood think this band was going to last. Even more disturbing, why do people think this is good glam rock? It's not even original! Along with Poison, this has to be the sorriest glam band to come out of the eighties. Just listen to Aerosmith instead of this crap. If good '80s glam is what you really want, just listen to early Motley Crue, Ratt, Dokken, or even Bon Jovi instead of this joke of a band."
1,LOOK AT THE COVER ART,"Look carefully at the cover art of this album. Tell why on Earth someone who likes real rock'n roll (or metal or hard)would dress themselves like that, or why a real rock / metal fan would buy an album with such a cover art ? The cover art says it all. CINDERELLA is just another bunch os smart musicians who tried to catch the "" glam train "" of the 80's. But the result backfired. GLAM almost destroyed metal and real rock."
5,Beast of a Rock'n'Roll Album,"Cinderella's Night Songs is a rock album that will live forever because of the great song writing, vocals, and great guitar work. There is not much else to say that hasnt already been said. I do want to let fans of Cinderella know about Jeff LaBar's new project called Freakshow. Its a great opportunity to hear new stuff from labar. Its an amazing self titled album on Retrospect Records and Im telling you that dissapointment is not an option with the album. Also front man of Freakshow Marcus Allen Christopher has a simalar sound to Tom Keifer. Trust me if you love Cinderella you'll love Freakshow. Until a new Cinderella album comes out, what else do you have to do? lol hope you guys check it out."
4,Another 80's classic. A must for any CD rock collector,"Great Cinderela's first album, it has Cinderella's original sound and each song a great rock vibe, very good album and enjoyable, screaming voice of Tom Keifer is fantastic!Another 80's classic, also this one must be rereleased on a new form; doing a remaster and merging it with the Long Cold Winter (both fits great on one CD, if posible adding b-sides such as: ""Don't know what you got"" instrumental and ""jumping Jack flash"".This way I would buy it again!It has very good songs such as the hits (Shake me, Somebody save) plus: Push, push, night songs.It a must at any collection of 80's best of."
4,discussion of 80's bands,Cinderella is one of the best tapes you can buy as far as rock bands go in the 80's. Songs like Shake Me and Somebody Save Me are the best songs going. If you like songs that you can crank up loud and jam to then this is the tape to buy.
5,cinderella rule,if the cinderella story were a tale of great love then cinderella the band a tale of great rock n roll .. its a most have in everybodys rock collection
3,Pretty cool.,"I remember getting my first copy of Night Songs in 1986. This is the only release from Cinderella that I've ever owned. They play good hard rock pop. Their style sort of reminds me of Kiss. Tom Keifer has a very recognizable voice. The musicianship, production, and songwriting are quite satisfying. The songs that I like the most are ""Night Songs,"" ""Shake Me,"" and ""Nobody's Fool."" ""Nobody's Fool"" is a really nice ballad. I still listen to this album sometimes. The guitar playing is really good and the album is energetic and fun. The album cover is cool too. Worth a listen."
3,Not bad,"I recently rediscovered this tape in my collection, and to my surprise I found myself getting into it. True, ""Nobody's Fool"" is almost a note-for-note rendition of Def Leppard's ""Bringin' On The Heartbreak,"" and Tom Keifer's voice can be like fingernails on a chalkboard after a while, but the lyrics are fairly decent and there's some interesting arrangements. And I'd forgotten how good ""Somebody Save Me"" is. With a different name and image, Cinderella might have gone a lot farther. As it is, ""Night Songs"" sounds pretty good on my car stereo--may be there for a while . . ."
4,"great band, great debut album","Made famous by Bon Jovi, but that doesn't mean they couldn't rock.Their debut album ""Night Songs"" is a great album to purchase, if youlike Les Paul driven Hard rock. Many hit songs, ""Shake Me"", ""Nobodys Fool"", ""Somebody save me"" just to name a few. The only drawback, is Tom Kiefer's vocals.His voice in some of the songs, takes a little getting used to. He soundsvery similiar to Brian Johnson of AC/DC, both having a raspy voice in all. Overall, an awesome album. Four stars."
5,outstanding,"really helps you re-evaluate what is ""good"" food. it is not a diet, it is a life style. i have already lost weight and i don't feel deprived."
4,Great book,This is just what I needed to get both motivated and on the right track to understanding what I put in my body.
5,grrreat,pretty good IMHO. Though I would like to know what alternative books that critcs like the one below should we the public take a look at instead ? IMHO if you are gonna make a negative comment then at least post a alternative that people can investigate and post why it's better.
5,This is the ultimate Fidelio!,"I've seen two other Fidelio productions and this is the first one I actually enjoyed/loved!! The orchestra and singing by the entire cast and chorus was simply magnificent from start to finish. You will not regret this purchase, I guarantee it!"
2,"Poor, poor Fidelio...","Rocco, dressed in Armani, tosses handfuls of american bills in the air when he is singing about Gold, Leonora can't help rubbing herself when she sings about Florestan, the Don is incredibly violent, burning things, spilling wine all over the stage. Poor Merzalline seems more in pain than in ecstasy.I felt ill as I watched Jaquino literally pointing a gun at Fidelio and Merzalline as they sing their quartet.Ironically, Leonora is loading a handgun as she sings her famous lines about Hope and Virtue.In this production, the music is light and Virtuous, but the acting and production are very base. I far prefer the production on VHS of Haitink conducting the Glyn. Opera House.I am 100% certain that Beethoven would disapprove of this production. It contributes to the unending degeneration of this humanity...and those with the eyes to see are crying..."
2,My kid thinks it cool,"My son thinks that this watch is really cool. But from a parnets perspective the watch is cheaply made. I expect it to last, if I'm lucky for one month. The velcro separated from the rubber band after only 3 days."
3,A general reference on fishing,"This is a broad overview of fishing, including general information on all types of fishing. Everyone new to angling probably needs ONE book like this, but don't expect to find any specific information on how to fish for a certain species in your area."
2,Pretty Boring Fishing Game,This game is not much fun and not worth $. There is no skill involved and once you hook a fish it takes forever to reel him in
3,From another time and place,"Thorne Smith had his day in the sun but it was many moons ago. This trilogy of his tales is pretty much representative of his kind of risque works that found a wide audience in the early part of the 20th century. He loved to write about the upper crust of polite society and show their true ribald side. I think today's readers will require something more than Smith has to offer but at a time when television was yet a dream and milk was still delivered to one's door-step, he was the cat's meow."
1,Save your money...,"I can't express how bad this book is. Folks, in all honesty this book offers no more insight or at the very least tips and tricks, than the user manual for PiXELS:3D. Do yourself a favor and just go to the PiXELS:3D site and download the PDF and demo for the program. I did, and let me tell you that Mr. ""Sham"" must have as well becaue his book had nothing to contribute. You'd be much better off getting the Power User CD!!!I gave his book 1 star merely because I could not give it anything less."
1,???,"The tutorials were confusing. Most of the book was spent mindnumbingly going through each tool and describing what each one does much like a manual. However this book neglected to explain any useful way of using any of the tools, much like a manual."
2,Adult reminiscing gets in the way of the boy's narrative.,"I am mystified as to why The New York Times raved over this novel. Though the author has a nice sense of place, he incessantly injects the dull reminiscing of the adult Will into what should have been a compelling story of the summer his family fell apart. He'll put in an aside to the effect of: ""And though I didn't realize it at the time, the way my father told that joke at the restaurant was an indication of a side of him we didn't often see, and now I understand that . . ."" Blah, blah, blah. Get on with the narrative, already! It also strikes me (as the mother of 2 boys) as extremely unlikely that this mom who loved him through childhood and into adolescence would desert him and disappear without a trace. A disappointment."
1,Good ...til you open it...,"So my father-in-law wants a ""really simple and easy"" digital camera. That worked out good because this camera didnt even work and you can't get any simpler than that! I gave this as a Christmas present if that wasn't bad enough. But, it always feels good to give a broken Christmas gift..its humbling if nothing else. Except I crawled under the couch and stayed there until everyone left because I was so embarrassed. It worked for .025 seconds but by the time I squeeled and threw it up in the air to look at it -it had shut off again. JUNK< JUNK< JUNK! You get what you pay for. Don't waste your life!"
2,Don't hold your breath,"If you have Windows 2000 don't even think about getting this camera. The drivers do not work and the manufacturer won't support you. Their updated drivers do not work either. However, if you have XP or 95 or 98 you'll be fine; the camera pratically sets itself up in fact. The users manual is ONLY on the CD, nothing except a quick-start guide comes printed. If you can figure out a digital watch, you'll have no trouble with this camera. Despite its shortcomings: no preview window, indoor shots come out very green, the flash doesn't throw more than 6 feet, max resolution is 640x480, ANY amount of jostle distorts the picture, and the 4 second lag - despite all that, this camera has its up side: it can hold a lot of images right out of the box, the battery life is good, and the daylight pictures come out nicely. This is a decent camera for kids or for your online auctions. I will never buy another Argus camera after my experience with this item however."
3,"Barely adequate ""Brownie...""","Think of this as your first Kodak Brownie film camera you owned, but with worse picture quality, and you won't be far off. It's OK for as a very first camera for kids (5-year-olds think it's fun), but don't expect it to rock their world... with no LCD screen, much of the fun of digital photography is missing."
4,A great program.,I thought this program was great. It was the story of a baby alligator and a baby crocodile. Both live in the same are of the Everglades. It is about their strugle to survive a hostile environment. They are forced to be on the move to new areas all their lives to find food and avoid being eaten. Only the lucky survive to adulthood. The photography was wonderful and the naration was quite good. I was quite surprised with how good this one was. I enjoyed it a lot.
2,far from comprehensive,"The music included in the set speaks for itself. Simply some of the greatest and most important music ever recorded. However,the collection falls short in an important area. If you already have a pretty good Armstrong collection and are trying to fill in the holes don't bother with this set. Almost all of the rarities are missing. It's basically a low cost duplication of material commonly available in other sets. You won't find Satchmo's 1926 sessions with Sippie Wallace or the Lil Armstrong Serenaders session or Satchmo's sessions with Erskine Tate's Vendome Orchestra or any of the other numerous sessions he played on with other artists in the twenties. It seems that once all of the American labels got their Armstrong boxed sets out over the last few years these enterprising folks from Holland simply copied what they'd released and combined the results into this set. You get what you pay for."
1,Not nearly enough power.,"The MiniSync cable is nice. It allows you to power the Zen Xtra while connecting it to your computer. The power adapter that comes with the bundle is tiny though. It only provides 400mA of current. The player will not function on that. It needs to be able to spin up the laptop hard drive that it has inside. The power cord that comes with the device provides 1.5A, almost 4 times what this power adapter is capable of.Don't buy this bundle, instead, buy the MiniSync by itself for charging your Zen Xtra while connected to your computer."
3,Not for Everybody as Marketed,"Although I really do like the color assortment and it looked LOVELY on the salesgirl's hand, the product is definitely not for all skin tones as she has assured me. Word to the wise: never go by what the color looks like on someone elses hand; they don't have YOUR skin.I am a ""Light"" to ""Fairly Light"" blue eyed blonde, and I am not afraid of a little (or a lot of) color. These however, were just too harsh and orangey for my skin tone. I really wanted them to work too; I tried them in all sorts of combinations, but eventually I had to accept the fact that something a little more neutral along the lines of maybe ""Celestine"" would work better on my blue undertoned skin.I strongly reccomend you get yourself down to a A BE Store or even an ULTA or Sephora to actually try these colors before you buy."
5,"Bare Escentuals, Get Started Eyes, 7 Piece Kit, ($95.00 Value!","I haven't use it yet, but I sure know I love it and will works well that's why I did buy it."
5,A very good book,This is a very good book on carving. Anyone can grasp what is being said and be carving in no time. Book gives a list of basic tools and wood needed. Use white pine to start out when you have a few carvings under your belt go to more expensive wood if you want to. Be warned once you start you will be carving every chance you get. The main thing is HAVE FUN. Remember carvers are sharp people.
1,Not Reccomended,"I gave this book one star only because I could not give it 1/2. This book is a series of reprints of old (really old, like 1960's) popular mechanics articles. There is no instructional material to speak of in this book, just a series of patterns with minimal detail. I put this book on the bottom shelf underneath old woodcaring magazines, the only reason I didn't throw it in the trash was I had spent the price of a good book on it and hated to see that go to the landfill. Buy books by Mr Pete Leclair, Dave Stetson, Mike Shipley, or Misters Wolf or Enlow instead of this ""moldy-oldy"" and you will receive value for your dollars."
5,Be careful unwrapping this item,The speakers come wrapped in bubble wrap and lots and lots of plastic around the wires. I made the mistake of using scissors when I first installed it and managed to cut the wire to the woofer. Amazon sent me a replacement the next day. I used a professional electrician to unwrap and install the second set.You may have to utilize Add/Remove Hardware in Windows ME. Also the sound controller in the Systray may have to be adjusted for balance and make the best of surround sound.The eventual sound quality is excellent. I should reconsider using my boombox.
1,"Very cheap speakers, NOT WORTH BUYING","Too bad Amazon doesn't let me give these things no stars. I bought these speakers for my son to plug his MP3 player into in his room. What a waste of money. These things sound terrible, but they make up for it buy having very little volume. The sound is muddy with very little on on the high end and the sub woofer is a joke. Take my advice, these are not the speakers your are looking for.I don't know what speakers the people who gave things good reviews were listening to, but it sure wasn't the set I bought"
1,These are NOT white speakers...,"I cannot comment on the quality of the sound or product, but they are NOT white but the regular computer grey putty color."
3,Good speakers for the office,"I bought these speakers to use at the office. I only listen to music, be it a CD, or streaming audio. For the size and price, they aren't bad speakers. The subwoofer puts out more than enough bass to use it at the office without bothering the people around me. The speakers do hiss, though. The hiss is there most of the time. No matter whether your listening to music you've downloaded, streaming audio or CD, it's there."
2,"Great value, but the left speaker stopped working (due to my negligence)","Adjusted rating: 4 stars.This speaker set is probably one of the best-sounding sets you can find for the price, and it served me very well... for a year. The left speaker just stopped working one day, with no sign of any damage anywhere on the speakers. However, I later discovered the problem was with the wire -- it was probably damaged due to improper storage on my part.Aside from that, the sound quality is good, though they don't go very loud and the woofer can be boomy at times (and there is no way to adjust it)."
4,"Clean sound, but highs are overdone","I agree these are a bargain at $20. The bass is fairly impressive for only a 3"" subwoofer, especially when placed on the floor. The position of the woofer makes a big difference.I wish they'd tone down the treble output since there's no manual control. Extended listening can be fatiguing. The searing highs give great detail and stereo imaging, though. I can now hear quantization noise (crackling) in 8-bit WAV files that I couldn't hear with my previous speakers."
3,Got my money's worth,"On the outset, i should say Cyber Acoustics CA-3000 2.1 speaker system is worth every cent i payed for it. The package has two small speakers which are similar to any normal computer speakers but of small size and power wattage. But, the sub-woofer is what makes this pack a worthy buy. Though the package came a bit chipped (sub-woofer box is made of cheap wood) and the speaker was un-protected, the sound quality was good. You can't expect 'BOSE' surround-sound from these tiny ones. But, definitely i enjoy my music better than when i used to listen with my 'in-built' laptop speakers (Dell Inspiron 8100)."
2,not very good,"these can't hold much sound. Though the bass speaker is cool and on-light is cool, they just don't come through with the sound I was hopping for. I bought another pair of speakers which i recommended above to buy instead which are $1 more, but are what I use as my stereo speakers now! I'd leave these alone - they're too delicate and though they look cool, the don't sound cool."
3,Cheap and fairly good,"For the price that it comes with, these speakers are good. However, once in a while I hear some scratchy sounds from them when I'm playing music, and the music quality is no problem."
4,"good for price, got to fix some aspects","good speaker for the price, as a beginer, i love it. however, the speakers don't magnetically shilded that well, there for, placed near the mornitor, they deliver me some humm noice. i'm looking for a better one now,,how ever, i totally satisfied with this one, umm, coz i cannot complain anything since i got it at 20 bucks, good product for a decent price"
1,Weak sound! My two speaker setup is better.,"I just received these speakers and I'm very disappointed. My altec lansing 2 piece speaker set from 3 years ago sounds just as good. If you plan on listening to a lot of music through your pc, just spend the extra and buy a higher end system. It's not worth the extra money, setup and wires for a subwoofer that doesn't add anything."
4,Not bad... Not bad at all!,"I purchased these because I purchased a new PC and my old Harmon Kardon speakers (so hard to say goodbye) just couldn't do it anymore. I have two high schoolers and am budget conscious and wanted something that would sound ""decent"". Well these are more than decent, they are actually pretty good. I must confess that I have some much nicer speakers I use for my home theater but for their intended purpose, they work well. No ""hissing"" and the bass is good, not great but good. Some of the reviews I read complained about the lack of mid-range but I found a solution by adjusting my computer's graphic equalizer. In conlusion, for about $20 bucks, this is a good quality product. If you're an audiophile, you'll be dissapointed, for all others, a great buy!"
3,Decent,"I bought this product from kmart. it was the 2nd best option they had for a good price. the sound quality is very good! overall: ok. so heres the breakdown :Pros: Loud, decent bass, cheapcons: too many wires, breaks VERY easilyone day i plugged it in, and the sound was completely messed up. so be careful with it, b/c its fragile!"
1,Already disappointed...,"I just opened the box of these speakers and low and behold, there is absolutely NO information about them inside the box. No owner's manual, warranty information, INSTRUCTIONS, etc. Needless to say, I am disappointed. I am not an idiot, but I do welcome a little guidance when it comes to electronic equipment. I don't know if I should just send them back without even trying them. I would have paid more for a system that had some helpful information included in the package!"
1,aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this freakin sucks!!!!!! dont waste 1 dollar on it!!!!!!! When i opened it it exploded! literally, like a bomb!!!"
5,Great little speakers!,"I don't normally write reviews, but I have to say that these speakers are probably the best sound for the price. I bought them as a temporary replacement while my *considerably* more expensive Boston Acoustics speakers were getting fixed, and I was shocked and impressed because the sound was almost on par with the speakers I had before. The speakers perform very well, producing good highs, lows, and a surprisingly good midrange--hard to find in speakers this size. I didn't even have to turn the volume past the halfway mark to get some pretty loud sound out of it. I almost felt guilty for getting that sort of performance out of speakers that cheap. In the end, I switched back to the Boston Acoustics because of its 4.1 surround sound, but for normal use, I didn't feel like I was missing anything by using these smaller speakers. I'm not sure about other Cyber Acoustics products, but these small, inexpensive speakers are definitely worth the money."
2,Started off great...,"When I got these speakers, I was surprised at how impressed I was at their quality for the price. Though I've heard better, the subwoofer was pretty nice. The only thing that changed my mind about them is how easily they began to fall apart- And by that I mean, the second speaker often went in and out and I had to adjust and actually tape down the wires a certain way for them to produce sound! It became ridiculous. Also, when other electronics got to close to it made that horrid buzzing sound... I wouldn't readily recommend them."
2,Don't Expect Great Sound,"I bought these expecting sound that'd be better than cheap 2 channel speakers, but instead I was eager to the turn them off to end the slaughter of my music. The songs from the satellite speakers were muffled and dull, whereas the subwoofer couldn't handle any amount of bass when the volume was turned past 1/4. The construction is cheap plastic, the wires feel cheap, the satellite speakers feel as they are hollow and the sub is downright sloppy. I understand these are cheap speakers, but I feel you'd be better off getting a comparable 2 channel speaker system, the quality will be superior.Overall I was unsatisfied with this product due to its poor sound quality. Since it played music and was easy to hook-up I'll give it a two star rating. Just consider your other options before committing to this set of speakers and don't make the mistake of purchasing them without hearing them first."
3,Good sounding speakers,"the speakers have a great sound quality, even when up at high volumes. i was disappointed with the sub woofer quality in comparison. it was airy and very distorted, only good for mid-levels and there is no way to change it unless using an EQ on the computer, and even then sounded poor. Mine is currently buried under 2 towels to help muffle it and make the bass almost decent."
2,Unimpressive,"I recently needed two sets of speakers, one for my new media computer and one for my home office; both are in bedrooms.I got theLogitech S220 2.1 speakersfirst (a little pricier). They did not blow me away, so I decided to try these CA speakers instead of getting another S220.Well, it was a mistake. These sound considerably worse.2 stars since they work and would probably be fine for someone who wasn't listening to music. I'll not be keeping them long."
2,"Had it for 18 months, then keyboard started to break","Pros: This calculator (and presumably other HP 48/49 calculators) has an operating system that far surpasses TI's in usability. The angled keys are really nice to use, when they work.Cons: Too bad it is hard to use a calculator with a broken keyboard. The bottom row's hinge have almost all broken, so the keys are really loose and wobbly. Apparently, the plastic hinge mechanism is really weak and this is a common problem."
3,preliminary review,"I just unpacked it and started messing with it.My first reaction is ""I miss my 48G"". :(I've heard bad things about the new key pad, and it definitly feels cheap. It might just take some getting use to, but I don't like it! (the keys aren't 'solid', and occasionally you can press a key so it 'clicks' but nothing happens)It seems fast compared to the older 48G, but then I haven't tried anything particularily challenging with it yet.They moved the <ENTER> key! (just something else I need to get use to)They include the RS232 data cable and software! (previously an expensive 'extra') However, I seem to be having some trouble to get it working (so far unsuccessful).It's not like we have a huge selection of RPN calculators (which is why I chose this one), so given the options it is really not that bad."
1,"HP made ''in China, not make that mistake","Do not buy HP calculators manufactured in China. The keys only work when they want. I always bought HP calculators including those made in Singapore. They had great quality. But these Chinese HP are a disappointment. If you do not want to have hassle, then do what I do: buy a Texas calculator."
2,I miss my 48SX,"Not much to say about this thing, other than I miss my 48SX. I used it for a good 17 years before it just went dead on me, and there was nothing I could do to save it.I replaced it with a 48GII. However, my ""new"" 48GII's keys regularly fail to register (annoying and frustrating), and I'm lucky to get a month out of the batteries with light use; my 48SX performed FLAWLESSLY though half of a bachelors degree, a masters degree, and 15 years of a career in engineering. It would only need new batteries every 8 months to a year. What's up, HP? Quit making this garbage and bring back a quality, well-made product."
1,why not get a HP49g+? Look at the price!,at the time of writing the HP49g+ is available onamazon at $77.99. Since the 48GII is a 49g+ withfeatures removed - why not get a 49g+ ?
3,Need old computer.,"I give it a 3 star because it's a great game but this doesn't work on new computers. I've tried everything I could find on the net to try to make it work and it still didn't work. If you have a old computer, this will work with no problem. Our computer isn't even a year old. Buy old games then you better have a old computer."
5,Silent Steel = A Cinematic Strategy Adventure,"Silent Steel is an all-video, interactive techno-thriller in which the user directs the story. Silent Steel casts you, the user, as captain of the nuclear ballistic missile submarine USS Idaho, on what is seemingly a routine peace-time patrol. As outside forces come into play, you find yourself in the midst of a life-and-death struggle to save not only your ship, but to unmask a traitor and reveal a sinister plot that could start a devastating global confrontation."
5,Spiritual RX: Prescriptions of Living a Meaningful Life,"I'm finding Rx an excellent reference source for personal growth. Previously, I had borrowed Rx from Public Library; however, I found it so rich with information which did not focus on only one, but many modalities to explore on a path of spiritual growth. Time to explore is needed for each chapter/concept presented. Anyone wanting spiritual/not just religious guidance won't be disappointed. Amazon Reviewed Purchase."
2,Nah...,"I love TOP...but I don't love this CD. ""Diggin' on James Brown"" is an awesome song. But it's really the only good song on this CD. ""Souled Out"" is alright. But the rest of the songs aren't so good. I bought this CD and was disappointed."
3,meh,"I love the way the sound is mixed on this recording. The bass is mixed out front, without being overwhelming. The horns are mixed more in the middle, yet still very clean and ""present"". But the tunes don't have that same ""zowie"" I'm accustomed to from my other TOP CDs. They usually exercise a bit of ""humor"" (like Monster on a Leash) in their tunes, not noticing that as much here either. Don't get me wrong, it's an ""ok"" listen, the last tune ""Undercurrent"" is fun, and the ""James Brown"" tune is good too. Just a little disappointed in the rest. Hopefully ""Back to Oakland"" will be better..."
2,Souled out-Sold out,"I would definately not rate this among one of T.O.P.'s towering accomplishments. The flavor of this CD seems to be slightly cheezy yet bland. Unfortunately it sounds like they have main streamed thier sound alot more, and have traded in some of thier funkier grooves for a more ""commercial"" and user friendly sound. Perhaps the most dissapointing aspect is the weakness of the Horn section. They have definately taken a blow from the personnel change in the trumpet section. The lines are not as tasty or arranged quite as well as they were under Greg Adams hands, and the lead trumpet sound is not as solid as it once was. In addition, I feel that the drummer was a poor choice for T.O.P. He playing is strait sounding and the electronic effects on his set gives the whole group a commercial 80's sound. Sorry, TOP I've been a fan for years, but this CD is a let down in the music selection and style. Hats off though to Rocco and ""The Doc"" for thier always stellar performances."
5,Great Book of Short Stories.,This is an awesome collection of short zombie stories. It is perfect for those of us that love the Night of the Living Dead movies.
3,A synthesis of practical wisdom,"I give this less than five stars partly because it's not the kind of book I normally read (someone gave me a copy) but I found the advice about how to be friends with your adult children useful. For example, Tessina suggests discussing adult topics with your adult child, not just family topics or questions about their personal life. Or if your adult child says or does something annoying, treat it just as casually as you would if it were someone else's adult kid saying something annoying (ignore it and don't let yourself be drawn into a family squabble).Here is a quotation starting a chapter that catches the flavor of the book: ""What we must keep remembering is that our bodies respond to the feminine principle, the goddess. They respond to rest, to nurturing, to a presence that says you are okay just the way you are."" -- quoting Dr. Christiane Northrup"
1,Disappointing offering from Putumayo,"I have both Women of the World:Celtic I and II discs from Putumayo which are really enjoyable and a delight to listen to again and again. On Putumayo reputation and the word ""Celtic"" in the title, I bought this album without listening to a single track. Bad move, outside of the nice cover and liner this album is a huge disappointment. Listen to the sample tracks and see if you don't agree."
3,Not so sure of this book,"Well, I really cannot say that I have finished reading the book. I will have to do so. But, I do have to say that I was a bit dissapointed. Personally, I believe that Wick's best work is in a historical western setting. This book seems nice, but I can't help but be cynical about the environment. The gossipers are believeable, but not the christian people. How could there be so many? If so, their views of christianity are different that what ours are. Since when does the aristocracy care about God on a personal level? Those who were religious where strict in their discipline. Plus, a pastor? They had vicars back then. I find it a bit historically inacurate. I suppose I should not criticize, I mean after all, it is fiction. What can I expect right? I do have to say that I like Wick, but not so much in this series. I'll have to read more to form an exact opinion."
3,Light reading,This was a light-hearted read that was enjoyable. There are things about Lori Wick's writing I just don't care for. The characters are too nice and constantly complementing each other. It's not realistic. Plus there's a bunch of unnecessary explanations. It's ok but not my favorite.
2,Good for an escape.,This book and the other 3 in the series are fine for an easy read to escape. But they are not great books. And it drives me absolutely CRAZY that just about ever name is taken from Jane Austen's characters. Could Lori Wick not come up with her own names?
3,Not one of the best,"This is close to a four but not quite there. Why?For a Peach DVD, the pacing wasn't good, the girls weren't the best (some really hot ones and some pretty average ones) and the run time for some reason seemed short. Also the bonus offerings kind of sucked compared to most Peach DVDs. Points off for that.There are 10 girls in nine vignettes, but at least two of those vignettes I have seen on other DVDs. Points off for that.Why exactly is this ""Fantasy Exchange Europe""? How does the title fit with the production? As far as I can tell, it doesn't. Points off for that.Around half of the models are stellar, but the other half will kind of make you yawn, both in terms of looks and presentation. Points off for that.Positive points for some really nice AHEM shots. But there are much better Peach DVDs out there."
1,This is not the 15-song European version of Arkhangelsk,"Beware! The U.S. version of Arkhangelsk only has 10 songs, and omits the last 5 songs on the European version of the CD. I bought this CD specifically for the hauntingly beautiful song ""Je t'aime, moi non plus"", which is song number 15 on the European version, but it is not on the U.S. version of the CD! Then I tried to download the mp3 of this song from Amazon's U.K. website, but it was blocked (evidently by copyright restrictions). Of course, the mp3 is not available on Amazon's U.S. website. The rest of the CD? Not my cup of borscht."
2,Good basic book,"Good basic strategy, would be great for beginners. Towards the end I know how my profs in school felt when I hit the filler material, it got VERY repetitive. Factual errors turn me off as well, Nokia is NOT a Japanese electronics company, and more comapnies had direct purchase plans then he listed in early '98 (like P&G). the pitch for the author's money management services at the end was a bit over the top as well."
1,English-Arabic/Arabic English Transtation: A Practical Guide,"I wanted a book that I could use to translate Arabic Words, Not Script, to English words. This book is not what I need.So I have been trying to get the seller to contact me about returning it, but they are not responding to my request."
3,Where's the rest?,"At first sight, this seems like an excellent chance to scoop up all of Donna Summers classic 12"" dance singles, but on closer inspection, you don't get all that much. Having long versions of ""I Feel Love"", ""Hot Stuff"" and the full version of ""Macarthur Park"" on one Cd is great, but where are ""Sunset People"", ""Rumour Has It"", ""On The Radio"" or ""Bad Girls"", instead of odd choices like ""With Your Love"" and ""Last Dance"". There is a better selection of hits on ""Anthology"", but it comes with far too much poorer material from Donna's later career (""The Wanderer"", anybody?), whereas ""On The Radio"" has a great selection from the classic years, but they are all too short and segued together-yuk! This means that the ""Dance Collection"" is not an essential purchase, but it's not expensive, and has at least some highlights of Donna Summer's career as a disco diva."
3,Not really the definitive collection we are waiting for,"This collection is great but it's just a first-step-purchase because:- The essentials Love to love you baby, Bad girls and On the radio are missing (Bad girls is available on the tape and all three songs are on the 4 cd-box The Casablanca records story).- With your love is edited on the cd (but not on the tape).- Heaven knows is not featured in its 12"" version.- Walk away is edited (the original 12"" is actually 8:30 long).- Except Hot stuff, Donna Summer's 12"" versions are not very creative if we compare them with the lp versions."
3,edited,"yes, with your love & hot stuff-bad girls come edited in this CD, there's an even longer version of walk away that is not in this album. but i was able to copy them all from my tapes & with SBM they sound amazing. is a real deception"
4,Good but incomplete,"Although this album is a good buy to get the extended versions of some of Summer's greatest dance hits, it is by no means complete. The omission of hits like Bad Girls, Love's Unkind and Love To Love You Baby and of great album tracks like Queen For A Day, Working The Midnight Shift, Lucky and Journey To The Centre Of Your Heart detracts somewhat from the promise of the album title. On the other hand, the inclusion of the magnificent MacArthur Park Suite makes up for a lot of what is missing. And this extended version of I Feel Love is worth the price of the album. Like another reviewer said, this ought to have been a 2-CD set. It is valuable to replace those old 12"" vinyl singles, but not a comprehensive reflection of the Queen of Disco's contribution to dance music."
3,Graphic SF Reader,Professor Xavier recruits Mystique to star in his own little private spy operation. Odd premise? It certainly is. This tale would probably transport ok to Wildstorm if you changed the characters.
4,Bryanissimo!,"Fans of Bryan Adams will know that ""I'm Ready"" was taken as an upbeat single from the album ""Cuts Like A Knife"" and re-recorded for the ""Unplugged"" album with a more intimate feel. Bryan has now recorded an Italian version of the single based on the ""Unplugged"" version.Zucchero (remember him, Paul Young fans) a popular Italian artist has re-written the words for this track (in Italian, of course!) and has done a reasonable job of making the single sound Italian. Listeners to Italian artists, such as Eros Ramazotti, Zucchero and the like will appreciate the hard but soft sound to this single.Having spent some time appreciating modern Italian pop (some good, some awful) and having seen Bryan in concert in Rome, I can say that Italians love the man! This new mix of an old song has turned another corner for the Adams/Vallance hit-making studio, offering Canadian rock to the inamorati in their own language.Definitely worth your money if you like Bryan's music and love Italian!"
