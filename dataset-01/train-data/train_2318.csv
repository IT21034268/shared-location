4,The best vampire romance from this series.,I have read all four books in this series and Forever and the Night out shines the other three.
4,A good book.,"If you like vampire stories, this is a must read. Very enjoyable, and hard to put the book down."
5,I Love All of Ms. Miller's Vampire Characters!! Wish for mor,"Damn! ""Forever and the Night"" left me sad about Aidan's position. Although I didn't agree with everything he said about being a vampire, I did admire him for his bravery, and that novel certainly hooked me into reading the last three! *applauds Sheryl* Thank God someone has said it! I love the character of Dathan, and, Ms. Miller if you're reading this, can you please consider about writing a novel about Dathan? He certainly deserves one! Anyhow, loved Maeve and Valerian and Daisy were my fave charcaters so far, (hopefully you'll write more....*sweet smile, hopeful look*) Anyway, thank you for creating some unforgettable Characters!! *applauds happily* Sincerely, Jennifer Blackett"
5,I LOVED THE WAY AIDEN REGRESSED INTO A HUMAN FOR LOVE,THIS STORY CAPTIVATED ME. THE FACT THAT AIDEN REGRESSED BACK TO HUMAN FOR LOVE WAS WONDERFUL. THE FIRST STORY IN THIS SERIES ALSO GETS YOU READY FOR THE REMAINING BOOKS IN THE SERIES.
1,"Cliched, dull, not horror - not romance","I was very disappointed after reading this book. The time-traveling vampires had me so intrigued, as did the back cover, that I jumped enthusiastically into FOREVER AND THE NIGHT. Unfortunately what I found there was trite, nothing new, and downright silly.The heroine Neely is ridiculous, and stupid. The plotline about the bad senator was ludicrous.Aidan is a pathetic protagonist. They fall in love immediately, gak, give me a break. A family of vamps with 2 little eerie girls a la Anne Rice, a warrior angel with such an original name, ""Nemesis"" oh lordy my eyes were rolling. Silly.Read the second one, FOR ALL ETERNITY - that was great! Five stars. Or read Christine Feehan's ""DARK"" series which draws you into its own reality and legend, you won't be able to stop reading those ""DARK"" books. Or find Charlaine Harris's ""Dead Until Dark"". Also superb."
1,Ugh....,"What else can I say? I don't understand how so many people liked this book. It had awful, just really really bad dialogue. Poor character development; all the characters felt like cardboard cut-outs with cheesy lines. The whole book felt stiff and uncomfortable, with events moving along without much dimension. Why should we care about any of the characters at all? The author did not provide any cohesive established background, just jumped into a story with improbable, Hollywood B-movie-like characters, actions and circumstances. I've read a few of the author's westerns and did not expect her paranormal to be so bad. Unfortunately, it was. I will not be trying another one."
1,Forever all right ...,I thought this book was way too intricated for what the author was trying to get across. I barely made it through the book and thought Ms. Miller has written much better books.
4,Good book but bad ending,"My friend recommended this book to me, so I decided to read it. I really loved it but was disappointed in the ending. It was a good book despite the ending, so I still recommend it.Check out Miller's other books."
2,Having a hard time,"I bought this book, from all the great reviews of all of his books, and was excited to find an author that had several books to look forward to. I am having a very hard time getting into this book. Yes, in places it gets exciting, and then it is just so so. Please tell me they are not all like this. I am so used to reading books that are non stop from beginning to end, and this one is just dragging for me."
4,"Excellent 1st read, I will read this author's work again",Mitch Rapp is a very active Hero and the adventures are spell binding. I will read this author's work again.
4,The Third Option,The Third Option was fast paced and exciting. A definite page turner. A scary look at how politicians try and overstep their boundries.
2,What have you done for me lately?,"I loved Vince Flynn's first 2 books. Unfortunately, his 3rd book, ""The Third Option,"" is not of the same caliber. It starts out with an exciting premise as Mitch Rapp is undertaking another dangerous mission, but rapidly devolves into just another run-of-the-mill ""evil politician"" book. And, unfortunately, the book never resolves most of its storylines, leaving us hanging (presumably to buy the next book) at the end. Anna Rielly, Mitch's love interest from the previous book, is present in this book, but is unfortunately presented as a cardboard character. There is almost no face-to-face interaction between Mitch and Anna in this book, which I found rather odd. Too much time spent on uninteresting political power struggles, and too little time spent with Mitch Rapp doing what he does best.After the promise of Flynn's first 2 books, I was rather disappointed with this one."
3,"Good, not great","I was a bit disappointed in this part of the Mitch Rapp series. It felt very much like a set up of the next books to come. A lot of character-building, very little BIG stuff. For me, anyway. I rushed into Separation Of Power (the next book in the series) and that however was superb. They could have been one big book."
4,"Better buy Seperation of Power to go with this book. Good book, just incomplete if you don't read Seperation of Power after!","Third Option and Seperation of Power could really be one book. If this was Clancy it would have been. Growing trend seems to be in a certain size book for this genre so I have an idea that's why it was split. Combined, these books offer a great story and compelling plot with plenty of action to go around. I really like the Mitch Rapp character. Do yourself a favor if your considering reading this book and pickup Seperation of Power at the same time. I was lucky and had ordered the whole Mitch Rapp series after reading ""Consent to Kill"". I'm out of order a bit as this was a latter book, but I've since started at the beginning and like I said enjoyed this book, but at the end I was like ""Hugh""! The ending was incomplete until you read Seperation of Power."
2,Mid Series,"Not having read any of these before, this entry feels just like beginning a movie an hour into it. Passable action but does not really stand alone."
2,Well written but leaves the reader hanging,"The Third Option starts off fast and carries through that way almost till the end, but the end is so incomplete that a reader can only think that the author was under pressure to get the book finished and just stopped. Too bad because it is an exciting book with a terrible ending."
4,"Complicated, and fun.",This one had a patient narrative unfold. It's the middle chapter of the trilogy. Perfect setup for the last...I'm definitely hooked.
3,Third Option Falls Short...,"After reading ""Term Limits"" and ""Transfer of Power,"" I had high expectations for ""The Third Option."" Unfortunately, I was disappointed. This book does not share the intensity of his first two, and it doesn't seem as though he really did his research for this one. The book is definitely readable, but the ending is abrupt and disappointing. If you haven't read Flynn's first two books, though, pick 'em up. They're both page-turners."
4,When is the sequel due?,"Another great political thriller by Vince Flynn, but the ending leaves us hanging. Needs a sequel to conclude the story. Too bad, but I hate reading an entire book, only to be left in limbo on the last page."
3,just a review,"overall, i thought this was a good book. i could tell i was reading the second in a series which was kind of annoying. i was a little disappointed in the ending...which i won't give away. i did like the action and the intrigue though. needless to say, this is a good book and i would like to read the next one by flynn!"
4,this isn't his best work,ok I accidently read this after Executive Decision so I already knew the ending but I think this books sequal was much better. Flynn is a great author though and if you have read this book by him only you owe it to yourself to read the others they are much better. I would recomend this book but you can skip it and just read Executive Decission
4,Good Reading...but...,"This is my third Flynn Book in as many weeks and it lacks the intensity of the first two. I sensed Flynn pushed the manuscript through a little to fast and was not able to offer the quality equal to his first two books. My advice would be to wait for the paperback. Warning: If you insist on reading The Third Option, I would strongly suggest that you read Term Limits and Transfer of Power first. Reading both beforehand will offer greater insight into those who Mitch Rapp trusts and why and frankly they're both great books. Otherwise some of the pieces will not fit."
5,"Vince Flynn Goes Three For Three With the ""Third Option""","Vince Flynn surpasses the strong efforts of his first two novels, ""Term Limits"" and ""Transfer of Power"" with a powerful, edge of your seat story of espionage, terrorism, and suspense.Mitch Rapp, the hero of ""Transfer of Power"", is once again the central focus of this novel. I find Flynn's ability to make Rapp almost superhuman at times, and confused and vulnerable at other times to be very endearing. The characters surrounding Rapp add depth to the storytelling. The action is great, the ability of Flynn to continually and credibly sew ""seeds of distrust"" keep you glued to the pages, and the plot line is filled with enough twists and turns to keep even a moderate fan of the genre interested. Finally, Flynn presents the episodes with enough technical detail to be believable, but not in the extraordinarily boring manner of a Tom Clancy. All in all, if I had three thumbs, they'd all be up for the writer and this novel!"
3,Essential plot for the Separation of Power finish,"I am going to punish Flynn a little for this one (yeah right). The Third Option and Separation of Power are really one novel broken down into two bits. After reading both, I realized that Flynn may have written one novel, knew it was too large for his crowd (Flynn stick below 500 pages), and he had to write some extra filler for two books worth of info. The new characters that are introduced are worth the read. Bringing in the Mossad and Ben Friedman was an intriguing catch point that kept Separation of Power going. That being said, I will talk more in my review of Separation of Power as The Third Option seems to just be the kicking off point for the story that develops there."
2,A terrible letdown,"Although many characters are stereotypes, plot and pacing got me hooked...until the end, which is a non-end. I was shocked that major issues were not resolved. For instance, we know the Bad Guy, but there's no intimation of whether or how he gets his comeuppance. I felt like writing the author and saying, ""If it's not too much trouble -- and doesn't cost anything extra --would you mind mailing me the ending of the story?"" Can't remember being treated this way by an author -- or being so disappointed in a promising story that starts with a bang and ends in a Black Hole."
3,The third option,It had its moments but not one of Flynn best books. Too much filler 're to inter pLays between the characters. Could have used alot more editing.
2,Lousy Ending,"Good read, typical Mitch Rapp story but the ending was so disappointing. I actually thought my Kindle malfunctioned and wouldn't display the last pages. The book (story) just stopped. It was by far the worst ending I have ever encountered- in any book. It seems that you have to buy the next book Separation of Power to continue the story. So I bought it- didn't like being forced to and thought it was a cheap shot way of selling books. Vince lost a lot of creditability with me."
4,The Third Option,Slam bang action. Mitch Rapp is the scourge of the bad guys in and out of government. Cross and double crosses abound. Fun read.
4,Mitch Rapp Continues to Kick #$%,Vince Flynn has created an exciting and dynamic character in Mitch Rapp. I can't wait for each new threat and am always delighted with the outcome. The writing is crisp and keeps me engaged tip the very last page and always wanting more.
4,Review the third option,The buying process from Amazon is always excellent. I enjoyed the book. Flynn has an authentic feel about his books.
1,Kindle book pricier than physical book,"The Amazon Prime price for the physical book is $7.99, and the Kindle price is $8.99.So Amazon now charging a premium for the electronic version! Great way to kill Kindle sales."
2,Jusr readable,Of all the books I have purchased on Amazon this one had to rate as the one that was in the worst shape. It was not close to being in a good condition.
4,Thriller,"Vince Flynn continues his entertaining writing style in this installment of the Rapp novels. The plot is fast paced, has multiple story lines moving forward with believable characters. I look forward to reading the next one in the series. My recommendation is to take them in order. It gives you more to read and helps you understand the context better. You will want to keep the next book on hand to keep the story moving."
4,THe Third option,"Have read the ""Mitch Rapp"" series up to this point in chronological order and like the stroies, but sometimes in an apparent need to get a sufficient amount of words in the book, it gets a little slow for my taste. But, I must say that I have enjoyed the series up to this point."
3,Vince could tighten up the series,"I agree with those reviewers who hate the pallid ending...I hate feeling manipulated into buying a sequel. That said, I generally enjoy series with recurring characters. I read all of Flynn's other books before I read ""Third Option,"" and my biggest gripe is with his female characters. Except for Dr. Kennedy, the women characters are dumb as fence posts. Mitch's girlfriend in particular is pathetically naive, overly emotional and childish...impossible to believe she is a major network's White House correspondent--she would have been weeded out long before in that tough business, good looks or no. I would expect more mature and realistic treatment of women characters from a guy of Vince's era and vintage. I greatly enjoy Vince's books, especially all the political and gadget commentary and description, but I simply have to skim over the ludicrous domestic-bliss sections involving Mitch or Congressman O'Rourke. Vince, Vince, please improve this!"
3,A Book With No Ending,"Vince Flynn is capable of writing a nice thriller, but The Third Option was a huge disappointment for me. This is a serial novel that has no ending. I liked Transfer of Power and Term Limits, but if Flynn pulls this stunt again, he will lose this reader."
3,The Third Option,"While worth reading, not Flynn's best work. His first 2 books were better, especially in their ability to keep you hooked. If your going to read a Flynn, read ""Term Limits"". Read this book when you're already a Flynn fan."
2,Poorly written and narrated,"Until this novel, Vince Flynn was one of my preferred authors. The narrative is poorly written, the dialogue jumps too much, the plot is weak, and it reads like a 5th grade level. He's lost pace with Ludlum and DeMille. In fewer words, the story is boring."
3,Love reading this author but this on had no ending?,So am I missing something? I love reading this author and have read all his books. This one though left me wondering why it ended with such a fizzle. I have grown to like the characters and want to know how they solved this case. It seems like there should be at least three more chapters.
4,Mitch Rapp to the Rescue,"This is one of the best entries in the Mitch Rapp series, up there with ""Consent to Kill.""Rapp is set up during one of his assassination attempts. He is betrayed and shot by one of his cohorts and left for dead in Germany. But Rapp doesn't die easily. He survives and escapes to the States where he must contend with conspirators in Washington. Flynn's description of the behind-the-scenes machinations in Washington politics is intriguing. Too, his depiction of Rapp the assassin plotting and executing his killings is realistic and fascinating. Highly recommended!--Bryan Cassiday, author of ""The Kill Option"""
3,OK but terrible ending,I didn't care much for this Flynn book. I thought the story moved along slowly and the ending was a big disappointment. Fortunately I've read several other books in the Mitch Rapp series and have thoroughly enjoyed them.
5,Hooked on Rapp,"These books are such compelling modern CIA/thrillers! A cab driver recommended Flynn, among other espionage type writers; I remembered the name and tried ""Memorial Day."" Needless to say, I was hooked. I think I've read them all and find I cannot put them down until finished. Not a bedside reading, that's for sure unless you plan to stay awake all night."
3,Complicated by many different names.,I have read some books by Vince Flynn and did know about some of the characters. This book is different. It has different characters coming and going and is difficult for me to read. I could not put down some of his books but this one is going slow. Still reading it.
2,Disappointing,"I thoroughly enjoyed Vince's first two books and enthusiastically purchased The Third Option. True to his first two novels, I could not put the book down until I was done reading it. I found the story very compelling. One problem however,...the book does not end. After spending the time (late nights and early mornings) feverishly reading the book, I arrived at the end and the story continued. I was very disappointed. I will try Vince again on his fourth book, but if the fourth one doesn't end, I'm out. There are too many other books competing for my time."
2,Waited for Nothing,"I was eagerly awaitng Vince's third novel after I enjoyed the first two so much. This book was very disappointing. The beginning was great--typical of his first two books, but there was no end. We were completely left hanging on almost every major point of the book. I will definitely wait for the library book before reading book #4. Is this one of those instances where a really good beginning author gets in too deeply and starts just churning out words to make the deadlines?"
3,Not Flynn's best work,"After reading his first two books, ""The Third Option"" is a major disappointment. It seems that Flynn was intent in working in every character that appeared in his first two books (at least those left alive). The plot suffers from all the re-hashing of old material. I don't mind a final tease to close a book, but this one really left the reader dangling."
4,The evolution of Rapp and company,"Flynn has hit his stride in this book. He carefully is starting to transition characters, which only adds to the complexity of the plot[s]."
2,hard work to read,"As a devoted Vince Flynn fan, I feel qualified to give this book a big thumbs down. It jumps from one character or set of characters to another forcing the reader to try to remember who was whom and what and why. I still have not finished this book after a month because I find it more work than enjoyment. Plus, in the parts where Mitch Rapp does show up, his role is way over the top, even for Mitch Rapp. Finally, the plot is a little silly in my opinion. Not the Vince Flynn level of book I have come to look forward to reading."
5,Flynn is ALWAYS a dynamite reading experience,"This book is brand new and arrived in that condition. I was not giving it as a gift, but I certainly could have because it was ""gift-worthy"" when it arrived."
4,Ranks among the best of Flynn's works,Fast paced action. Easy to follow and pick-up the action even if you put it down for a while. It's almost like being at an action packed movie.
2,"Terrible, compared to the first two","i couldn't put down flynn's first two books. they were great! i could put down this book. plus, there was no ending!!!!!!!!!! there is no excuse for this. there is absolutely no conclusion. i just have to pick up the next installment and start where the third option stopped."
4,Vince Flynn's Books Are Great!,I have read every book he has written to date and am anxiously waiting for his next one. His books are real page-turners that will keep your heart pounding from start to finish!
3,"Shameless setup for ""Separation of Power""","Mitch Rapp is back -- the most effective agent on the CIA is sent to Germany to assasinate a person who's helping Saddam Hussein despite repeated warnings. What Mitch does not know is that he's also a target; somehow Mitch escapes and decides to track down his killers. Things are complicated since he cannot trust anybody now, not even his own agency which could have set him up!However the bad part about this book is that it does not sustain the tension that is setup in the opening few chapters. It also shamelessly sets up the next book in the series ""Separation of Power"".Also, viewers need not be worried that they'll miss something; since ""Separation of Power"" is a stand alone book that could have done without this book!I love Vince Flynn & Mitch Rapp, but I seriously think this could have remained a silent chapter in the adventures of Mitch Rapp..."
1,Shameless setup,"I've read several Vince Flynn books, but this was the last one. The story was mildly interesting and kept me reading. But the book ran out before the story. It was a cheap shot to split the story over two books forcing the reader to shell out more money to find out how it ends. I felt ripped off and went on to find other authors that are more respectful of their audience."
1,RIP OFF,"I HAVE READ A COUPLE OF BOOKS BY FLYNN. CERTAINLY NOT LITERARY MASTERPIECES BUT AMUSING AND FAST PACED ONCE YOU GET BEYOND THE CANNED PLOTS AND THE SAME SET PIECE FORMULA. THE OUTCOME IS NEVER IN DOUBT.............UNTIL YOU BUY ""THE THIRD OPTION"" WHICH DOES NOT EVEN HAVE AN ENDING. THE LACK OF ANY CONCLUSION IS CLEARLY INTENDED TO LURE THE BUYER INTO BUYING THE SEQUEL. THAT'S PATHETIC AND I WILL CERTAINLY NOT BUY ANY MORE OF HIS BOOKS."
2,Some improvement,"yet another Flynn book... He has gotten better at dialogue and making the plot tighter, but weaknesses remain. While he has introduced some nuances into professions (some good politicians, some evil commandos), there still is a bit of a comic book quality to Flynn's characters (college students are self-rightous, commandos virtual knights of chivarly etc.). Especially the female characters who are just too emotional and phsyically perfect. Why are all goodies fit and attractive and the villian of the story fat? Rapp is just too much at times, like some reject from a 1980s action film. The blatent lack of a end to the book to get you to buy a sequel is shameless. His good action and pacing, his imaginate plot ideas remain good though."
2,Pretty good book with a couple of negatives!,Pretty good book. Uncovers the true bureaucracy going on in Washington. The author is a pretty good fantasizer. Nice work.A couple of negatives about this book that made me decide to rate it not more than 2 starts:* Very dragged out. He could've written it in half or two thirds the size* To many characters. Very confusing. And some names are similar.* Some stuff in the book is just not possible. Completely fiction.* Very silly ending. It's like the whole book makes no sense when you get to the end.I recommend books from Andy Mcnab. An excellent writer on secret intelligence and on the field.
2,"2 1/2 Stars -- What Happened, Vince?","After reading Flynn's first two books, Term Limits and Transfer Of Power, I was looking forward to another tale of non-stop action and thrills. Much to my surprise, however, The Third Option,was a big disappointment. The plot was too dragged out and the action was neither very exciting nor frequent enough. Further, the biggest letdown in this book pertained to it's conclusion -- or lack thereof. The Third Option ends leaving the reader ""hanging."" Flynn is an author that I felt I could count on for edge-of-your-seat suspense and a very satisfying reading experience. Unfortunately, Flynn let me down big-time in his third effort featuring Mitch Rapp. I'm hoping that this book was just a fluke and that the others in the series will live up to the high expectations I have when I pick up a Vince Flynn book."
5,MUST HAVE For Kindle,"I have a paper back copy of this and I feel that it is an essential part of my library. As a former Navy Combat Medic detached to the Marines, Basic and Advanced EMT, as well as currently working as an MLT this book is a necessity not just for patient treatment but for a good understanding of emergency response to bio-terrorism. This is a MUST HAVE ON MY KINDLE, not just a ""I would like to read this on my Kindle."""
5,Good Taste and High on Fiber,"I bought this for my mother because she needs to eat more fiber. She is sensitive to a lot of food but she loves these biscuits. More importantly, it helps her go to the restroom more regularly."
3,Poor Packing;material good!,The biscuits were not properly packed. Bubble wrap was just put in the box.I think it could have been wrapped around the biscuita. One pack's biscuits were crushed badly!
4,"Product is great, but unforunately some crushed.","These are really good, but unfortunately sometimes don't ship all that well. About 1/4 of the biscuits were cracked and some were crushed"
5,An old favorite!,My favorite biscuit now available in the US! They are wonderful as-is with a cup of tea or coffee and do try them with cheese!They supply fiber and are relatively low in sugar. The perfect treat!
5,Just Exactly Right,"This is a crunchy, barely-sweet, perfect accompaniment to practically any not too sweet drink -- tea, of course, including iced tea; milk or Ovaltine, dry white or red wine [include some cheese]; coffee; whiskey; brandy. Include some in a packet of home-packed snacks that you carry on a car or plane trip. It's true that they arrive a bit smashed: phooey! Well, pick out the chunks and enjoy! I have some round tins that I got from American Science and Surplus; these tins are exactly the right size to hold about ten biscuits, and keep them on your desk, by your bed, or in the snack pack. The lid is sort of loose. There are some other round tins that chocolate sections from Trader Joe came in; these have tight lids and hold about four biscuits, so are a good choice for purse or backpack."
3,Nature poems for young readers,"These poems, mostly about nature, are organized around the four seasons in a layout that invites more intermediate young readers, but the strong rhyme and perfect rhythm could also make them well suited for a younger audience, if taken a few at a time. Pencil lithographs accompany the text."
1,Pure Irony,"Bill Hicks was and the most educated comedian I have ever had the joy of listening to. I became a huge fan of his when I first saw his one-night stand on HBO (something that should be out on DVD) when I was 13 and immediately loved him. I have been a huge fan for close to a decade. All I have to say about his life and this book is that both were and are plagued with irony. He was a Texan with the surname of Hicks and he was one of the most educated people I have ever listened to while his book was probably the most poorly written piece of literature I have ever read. The book is plagued with typos poor spelling, grammer, and incomprehensible sentences. Many times the typos were so horrible that I had absolutely no clue what the sentence was trying to say. Shame on you Cynthia True for defiling a great man's memory with such a sad display of writing. Poor Bill. Nothing seems to go his way...even in death."
1,Bill deserves better....,"Cynthia True's book is a softbound equivalent of a fluff piece in a celebrity magazine. I read this book based on a recommendation from a friend, and was certainly disappointed. If I wanted a transcription of Bill's routines on his four widely-released CD's, I could have done it myself. The book does have some nice pictures, and you could write a 100-word bio of Hicks that would hold a minimum of interest as he was such an enigmatic character, but this ""book"" (and I use the term lightly) is a disgrace."
2,Comedy genius reduced to paperback,"Informative facts provided by Dwight Slade (childhood friend). I had a problem with the foreword...Janeane Garofalo? Wouldn't her work with Denis Leary disqualify her from any association to Bill Hicks? Perhaps the author could've found someone who knew him. By the way, the Groucho Marx joke Garofalo took credit for does not apply to this subject. If she needed to rip off a Marx joke, maybe ""Humor is reason gone mad"" would've been more appopriate. Or this one, ""from the moment I picked your book up until I laid it down, I was convulsed with laughter. Some day I intend to read it.""American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story"
4,A good biography,"I read this book in about a day and half, it keep me turning the pages and thats what its about.It has some very interesting stories behind Bill's comedy and for his fans they are invaluable. Check it out.A good companion to his work, helps you place events in his life around certain gigs that the fans have seen via bootlegs.One little side note, the English/Australian version of this book has a cover photo of Bill lighting a cigar on the American flag, the back has excerpts of his comedy, and the forward is by an English comedian rather than Janeane Garofalo, so try and pick up the English version which is by all accounts better and doesnt have a condescending intro."
3,For the Fans,"True's account of Bills life was brilliant for me. It gave an insight into his personal life that I and all his fans have been longing to know for years.It's lack of comedy wasn't due to the author, more the loss the comic timing in written word. The books biggest drawback is that I don't think it will bring in any new fans to Bill's work. He is/was an inspiration to listen to. But you can't just say that and people will convert.I also think his beliefs and emotions weren't tapped into deeply enough. He was an angry man, though reading the book I couldn't really tell where that anger came from.Also I read the UK version which unfortunately had no pictures that I was just hanging for.All in all an enthralling read for Hick's acolytes."
5,Bill Hicks - Gone too soon.,"This is a fascinating read and I could not put it down. The author just dives in and gives us Mr. Hicks, warts and all. I have passed it on to a friend to read. It arrived in a timely manner and was in good condition."
4,Interesting read,I bought this shortly after discovering Bill Hicks. He has quickly become my favourite comedian. This book is a pretty easy and quick read. All in all a very enjoyable purchase.
2,Great comic; interesting life; poor book,"I am a big fan of Bill Hicks and I was interested to learn more about him. This book did not help. This is a rather dull biography providing a largely chronological account of his all too brief life interspersed with copious extracts from his stage material. It totally fails to capture the spirit of the man.If this is your only exposure to Bill Hicks then you will never understand why he was so fantastic - go straight to the source - don't bother with this book, buy a Bill Hicks DVD (e.g. Totally Bill Hicks which includes a documentary and a performance) or CD."
3,Cynthia True needs an editor,"Seriously, the book covers a lot of interesting things in Hicks' life but the editing is non-existant (misspellings, grammar problems, incorrect product names, strange terms - Bill was a baseball player with ""...a great right pitch.""). The story is quick and dry and really adds no insight. But if you're interested in a quick read about Bill Hicks life and the chronology of things this will surely do the trick."
1,GOD THIS WAS BAD,This writer has no talent...I hope she retires her pen to avoid any further damage to the literay world!
1,BURN THIS BOOK,"First...a writer should be able to write before a writer makes a book...if you want your eyes to burn from crap, read this book. The author is bad....REALLY BAD....NO TALENT AT ALL"
1,Machine Drummin madness WHAT WAS BILLY THINKING????,"If you are a ZZ TOP PURIST...someone who loved them from the beginning, someone who owns (owned) all of their vinyl releases from ZZ TOP'S FIRST ALBUM through EL LOCO...You'll be amazed at what has happened to this music. Billy Gibbons got behind the control board, re-recorded the drum tracks on every song (except the live ones on FANDAGO!) with digital drum machines and added horrible digital reverb to teh vocals.GEEZ!! What happened to the raw, subtle rockin' your a$$ off early ZZ TOP? Billy has destroyed the essense of the early LP's by ""updating"" the recordings. I admit, the effect is rockin' but it's not the original ZZ TOP records we all love.If you want the original six, sounding like they should, go to the used record store and buy vinyl copies!! Beware the cassette reissues are [messed-up] too!!AVOID THE SIXPACK!!!"
1,a totally botched job,"This should have been a great boxed set. The original material, is brilliant, classic American blues-rock. Sadly, the ""improvement"" of the sound in the remastering process renders the material painful to listen to (if you're famailiar with the originals). Skip this boxed set. The early albums have now been released individually, without this heinous remastering."
1,This is all wrong - buy the originals,"They remastered and goofed this really bad. The sound is terrible. It is one of the worst remasterings I've ever heard. Unless you are a collector or really curious...dont touch this one. For new fans, I reccomend the early ZZ, pre - Tejas. Other than Eliminator - 80's and 90's ZZ Top is lousy, aside from their wonderfully tuned guitars and slick production (yawn)."
1,I want my money back!,"It's a crime. A great collection of songs, remastered by deafs...The band sounds like playing in the inside of a tunnel.If you are a ZZ fan from the seventies, please do you a favor, don't buy it."
1,I Want My Analog ZZ Top....,"Why someone felt the need to digitalize the first 6 ZZ Top albums is way beyond me. The songs are great, the packaging is pretty good and the sound is terrible! Let's hope for remastered verions from the original analog tapes. Until then, go for the new ""Chrome, Smoke & Bbq Box"" over this cr@p."
5,Z Z Top Music!!,"We love ZZ Top, their music is great and this is a wonderful gift set! This set was full of a lot of their great music."
4,Powewrfull and Fresh!!,"The Six pack is a big improvement from the single CD's In both volume and power . With ZZ being esentialy a blues rock band, The volume of the Guitar needed to be improved .Thank Eliminator and Afterburner for the inspiration to go back and tweak the albums . The Gibbons Guitar sound wasnt really messed with that much only the drums for the most part.I am a Drummer myself so i enjoy the new sound ,the volume is simply super!.So forget about the sound ,concentrate on Billy ,Frank and Dusty playing their instruments and just""Enjoy and Get it On"" .At least they didnt go back and re record with someone else playing drums like on the newest Ozzy Osborne remasters.!"
1,"Drink a fifth before sampling the ""Six-Pack""","You'll be suckin' your teeth lookin' for the receipt after you listen to this box-set. However, since I already own it, this is a turd I just can't flush, afterall its still ZZ Top. Sadly, after twelve years of sitting on the shelf, its still as wet, brown and smelly as the day it was dropped from Warner Brothers' bowels....I hardly listen to it."
5,the ultimate zz collection,"I guess the heading says it all really, this ""six pack"" is a must for all zz /blues rock fans."
1,Garbage Remixes With 80's Gimmickry,"As part of an attempt to capitalize on the success of their Eliminator sound, ZZ Top decided to go back into the studio and remix and also re-record parts of their first 6 albums thinking it would make them more money and entice fans of their newer sound to go back and buy their earlier records. Well guess what, in the process their older fans who were used to the original versions on the old cassettes and albums were shocked when they listened to any of these first generation CD releases. They heard bogus reverbed drums, and entire sections of both music and vocals re-recorded. Talk about tarnishing the legacy of a great band's output. Well someone finally wised up and now at least Tres Hombres and Fandango are now available in original mix, remastered form. So stay away from this trash and wait for the entire back catalog to be released in it's original mix, remastered form on CD."
1,Should be NO STARS,"What the Heck was Billy Gibbons and the other Tops thinking when they re-recorded the drums with the Eliminator Drum Machines!?!?!?This re-release of ZZ TOP's first six ( and best 6) albums should have been ZZ TOP nirvana for fans, instead it's a turbo charged headache. The fake drums are GOD AWFUL!Buy the vinyl with the original drum tracks, like they were meant to be, and the way fans like me love them."
2,SPACE WOMEN ..... THE FINAL FRONTIER,"The cover tells the whole story, but just to synopsize:Four men and a nymphomaniac woman comprise the crew of a space ship on a seven-year voyage, and when they land after numerous amorous adventures in space, they are greeted by a race of Amazon women, one of whom falls for the dashing young captain who helps her to overcome an assortment of monstrous beings between their dalliances.Hot Dog! What a story.For what it's worth, the cover and spine list Pete Lewis as author, but the title page lists Peter J. Crown as the writer."
4,A HUMOROUS ANTI SELF-HELP BOOK,"The author, who won the Annual Readers Choice for this book, makes a reccount on every type of self-help book, saying this is not a self-help bool.In fact, it is, with it's story of a young boy who carries an egg, his inner egg, and gains respect from his people.This book is about our inner egg, our hidden secrets, and it reads fast and delightfully.For a light and funny lecture, this book has 4 stars."
1,Not worth Learning,Criticism comes easy for the author and use of this commodity is made widely in this book. Poking fun on Self-Help books the author tries to demean them and suggest that use your own methods to grow. The author has tried to be funny by using the Parable approach and suggest us that its foolish to follow them. But the author forgets that the people who buy these books are no fools and only because that the selfhelp books help them do they buy them.Overall a BAD buy.
1,the bad art of praying mantis,"doesnot represent northern preying mantis at all just made to make a quick buck wouldnot refer to anyone no applications,or footwork this is what americans refer to nothing but dance no substance even the title is a joke compared the the real system"
5,Empire of the Sun,"The song Suo GanStirs an undescriable inner feeling of strength, sadness and joy that evokes strengths in one beliefs."
3,a mixed bag,"Tracks 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, and 13 are wonderful. Suo Gan is a beautiful song. Of Williams' underscore, ""Cadillac of the Skies"" soars to truly majestic heights and is definitely one of the composer's finer moments. ""Jim's New Life"" is a highly enjoyable, jaunty piece. ""Toyplanes, Home, and Hearth"" introduces a subtler theme, very touching, but it doesn't really get the development it deserves. The choral piece, ""Exultate Justi,"" is really entertaining if not entirely stylistically original. You don't get to hear too many full blown Williams choral pieces like this.The rest of the CD, sadly, fails to live up to the potential hinted at by the cues I've pointed out. The rest consists of some really boring, unmemorable dramatic underscore that isn't as thematic or exciting. On the whole, it all adds up to only an average John Williams album. It's certainly not as great as some of the other scores for Spielberg films."
3,Not your best I'm afraid Mr Williams!,"John Williams is my favourite movie composer and I love most of the music he composes, but I have to admit the score for ""Empire of the Sun"" was somewhat disappointing. Though the music pieces all suit the scene perfectly as is usual with John Williams (and ""Lost in the Crowd"") had me on the edge of my seat the first time I heard it), few of them stick out to me.The reason this doesn't get two stars was because of the title song, ""Suo Gan."" It's a beautiful, haunting melody that I will never forget if I live to be a hundred years old. I'm not sure if John Williams composed it though; I believe it's an old Welsh lullaby. But kudos to him and Steven Spielberg for choosing it though!"
1,disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this CD, the title is misleading, Los tres amigos, Luis Miguel, Joan Sebastian and Alejandro Fernandez do not sing any of the songs, somebody sings imitating their voices. On the cover, in the botton right corner in very, very small letters it reads ""performed by some unknown group"" don't buy it, you will be wasting your money."
1,AcAdaptor for Cobra,"I ordered the unit twice, and twice I received a Carrying Case. not the adapter. I returned both and ordered direct from Cobra.When I had called customer support for Amazon the second time, I got connected to India of course and was informed that a lot of their codes are wrong. I guess they are trained to agree with anything the customer says."
1,AMAZON - Please Correct !!!,"-It appears my complaint has a FOUR year history............ordered a 120-volt AC Adapter(as pictured) and received a Cobra MNA-2300CS Carrying case. I should have read the descriptor and reviews prior to order so I share the blame. Will keep the case, which if returned would probably result in another case according to the reviews, but will seek product on Cobra website. Will be more cognizant of potential problems in the future. The least AMAZON can do is correct the advertisement as previously suggested."
1,Facercise,I don't know why I buy these types of self help books. I have not found one in all my years that I have been able to follow or get anything out of.
4,"carole, what should I do?","Dear Carole,I am 41, and I started to do your exercises daily. I havefive children, I go to school part time every day, I haveto take care of my home and everything that goes with it.Eventually I stopped because when I was done with everythingat 11:30 p.m., I was just too tired to do 20 minutes evenonce a day. I look tired and worn out. what should I do?"
1,Not well written or illustrated,"I bought this book hoping it would show me how to do the excercises. Most of the book is dialogue explaining how wonderful the benefits are. When I finally got to the ""how to"" part I was disappointed. The explanations on how to do the excercises were vague and the illustrations were very limited with one or two photos. The first two excercises were nearly identical - I still can't figure out what the difference is. The book refers you to a DVD (which you can purchase) if you need help. This just makes me feel like I've been suckered in. Perhaps I'll look for the DVD at the library. I'm certain that excersising the facial muscles would be beneficial. I just would like an honest book that shows how to go about it. This wasn't it."
4,Easy and Effective,This book is easy to follow and do the exercises. It does a great job explaining which muscles each exercise targets. I would have liked a video go with the book. Over all its very helpful and fun and easy to read.
1,Disappointed,The book really didn't provide enough photos demonstrating the exercises. The worded descriptions just don't work as well for me. I went back on line an ordered The Facial Workout DVD by Tai Reinharts and will be working with this concept that has a step by step visual with complete workout repetitions.
1,It was horrible!,"I was actually on here looking at another book written by someone I saw on Rachael Ray, but I read so much about Facercise in those other reviews that I decided to get it instead. I began doing the exercises exactly as the book described. Within a matter of a few days, my jaw began to ache and click very badly. I could hardly open my mouth without a loud cracking sound and it felt like I was going to have lockjaw. Every exercise requires you to have your mouth open very wide during the routine. I had to stop doing the exercises and it took several days for my jaw to feel better, but there is still a mild clicking. I'd be very careful about doing the exercises with your mouth open the way it suggests."
1,"waste of money, and time.","I read all the positive and negative reviews before buying the book, and decided to buy it anyway to give it a try.I do not have any wrinkles however, I have noticed that I started having sagging along the jaw line, and the nasal labial fold became more pronounced and wanted to improve the muscle tone.The exercises in the book are described in a very vague way, after reading them again and again I was still not sure what you have to do. In some of the exercises you have to imagine your muscles lift, I have never heard of imagined exercises.Maybe the video is more beneficial. The book have photos of ladies who achieved great results in ONE week demonstrated in before and after photos. Carol in her book urges you to do the same, to take photos of your face at the start and two months later. My before and after picture show NO improvement after two months of doing these exercises every day."
5,Good book. Reliable sender,"Even though used, the book came in a vey good condition and on time. Like the sender. Still working on the book, but so far it is informative and well worth trying before going to plastic surgeon. My face isn't THAT bad, but to postpone ageing effects of stress and other, it is a good start"
2,The photos of women look fake...,"I thought that the photos ofthe women who supposedly have done the exercises are fake looking. I couldn't see any changes except that ""the before"" have less makeup on and ""the after"" have more makeup. Especially lipstick to help brighten their faces. I've tried it but find it difficult to do the exercises as much as they recommend. Haven't seen any difference either."
1,Does not work - be careful,"This did not work for me. Be careful, you might create creases/wrinkles by exercising your face.;"
1,Bad as the 2:00am infomercials,"The entire book was a sales pitch for facial exercises...WITHOUT any facial exercise! Well, there is one teaser. But the author tells every reason under the sun we need to do this but guess what the tools are NOT there. But for a mere $246.00 and her web address...which is in the book...then she will tell you how to do the exercises. Very, very, very disappointing!"
2,VERY subtle change if any,"I've been using Carole's Facercise (both the beginning and advanced video versions, and I also use the book) for several months now VERY faithfully. I perform the exercises two times per day (I have not missed one day), and I'm careful to make sure I'm getting the ""burn"" with each of the exercises. I took before pictures, and have continued to take pictures every couple weeks. I really can't see any change. :("
5,Fabulous Program!,"I am absolutley thrilled with Carole's new book. The excercises are easy to follow and the advanced exercises have already shown me results!! I have both Ms. Maggios books and where else can you find a program that allows you to correct your facial faults without plastic surgery? I'll be 51 soon and people think Im 35. Carole has always been helpful to me when Ive called her and has even gone out of her way to answer all my questions. I highly reccomend this program. Sincerely, Michelle Ellias"
2,"""Uplifting""","I not only read the book from ""FACERCIZE"" but alsosent away for the video, tape, cream and booklet on faceexercises.....I was so exstatic the day it arrived since for years I had contemplated actual plastic surgery on parts of my face and neck, so along with it and my reading material, I proceeded for the next month to give myself over to the care of Carole Maggio. Unfortunately, after almost 30 days I was unable to detect the slightest difference, and then proceeded to return my goods ..."
3,Do I need the video now?,Most of this book is about singing the praises of facial exercises. The section where she actually explains the exercises is poorly written. I can not figure out what she is talking about. Line like: imagine a pencil coming out of your mouth. What does that mean? All the pictures look the same. I suppose that now I need to buy the video to she what she is talking about.
5,Facercise,"Good book, easy to understand and practice. Arrived in time and in good condition. A definite must for the middle aged woman trying to maintain her attractiveness."
2,TMJ,"I have the 1st book that carole wrote. I believe this is the second !I tried the book for acouple of months, till I started to have JAW problems, from some of the face excerses.I went to my Dentist and now I have TMJ, which I did NOT have before..I gave this book 2 stars, for the eye lift or eye-brow left..By putting your two fingers under your eye-brow on the bone, and pushing the eye-brow down, and your two fingers up, trying to resists, does work for a very short time...Its actually amazing how it opens your eyes, but it's a very short lived fixed."
3,complicated instructions,"I really looked forward to receiving the book and had great expectations. However, I was disappointed. The exercises are complicated, the instructions not at all clear, as if Ms. Maggio is explaining to someoene who already knows how to do the exercises, not to a new reader. The exercises might be effective, but very difficult to carry out. No results from the exercises."
4,Great Results,"The book is good, but the video is best for really understanding how to perform the exercises. I have had remarkable, positive changes in my looks by regularly using the program, with many friends and co-workers commenting on how much better I look. The program is well thought out and put together.Hats off to Carole for developing such a wonderful program!"
4,"The book is interesting, but the video is easier to follow.","I love the Facercise system, but got the video first. I saw serious improvement in my hooded eyelids and double chin within 7 days. Have now been practising for nearly one month and continue to see progress. I decided to get the book because I am hooked on the system and wondered if there would be any helpful additional information - of which there was some. However overall if you're choosing between the book and the video for a kick start, I don't think you could beat the latter."
4,Positive Results!,I have used Carole Maggio's Facercise program for six weeks. I have noticed the difference in tone under my eyes; I have more taut skin; I have brighter eyes and the general tone of my skin is better. I do believe that the book could have been written better and I agree that after photos should be with/without makeup to compare with before photos with/without makeup. This is the first publication. I'm sure the best is yet to come! Thanks Carole Maggio!
4,It works!,"When I was on Amazon reviewing all the face exercise options,I could not help but notice how many reviews that Carol had, andhow high they were. So of course, I went with her. I bought herbook. I found that it was difficult to perform the exercisesjust from the book. I went back and bought her Ultimate FacerciseDVD. It was very helpful. I was happy and surprised to see changesoccurring on my face after a few weeks. In my case it was not dramatic,but that is because I look pretty good, and not too much aging yet.I wanted to deal with it before it got too bad. There is a a definate,noticable improvement in the nasal labial lines, also, the skin over myeyes has lifted, so that it does not lay on my eye anymore. I alsosee improvement in my jaw line. I'm only doing the exercises oncea day, and I think that if I did them twice a day, I would see more.I am very happy with the changes, and recommend her DVD."
1,Save your money,"I purchased this book after reading the reviews and found it to be a waste of money. If you even understand how to do the exercises, you won't feel the pulsing or the burn she explains you're supposed to feel. The pictures are almost identical and you can't tell how she is doing the exercise. Save your money."
4,Interesting. But lost interest after a few day.,It was fun to find the different muscles in my face. I did them for a few days. But quickly lost interest.I think it is worth the read.
1,All the Five star reviews are BOGUS!!!,"I love amazon sooooo much and I read a lot of reviews in my day so I can spot a fake a mile away. The five star reviews for this book are all written the same, and more importantly, NEVER REVIEWED ANY OTHER ITEM!Be carefull when doing facial excersices because they can actually cause more wrinkles. Use common sense and don't believe everything you read. When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is.Check out the people who graded this book fairly and see that they posted reviews on other items, not just this one like the five star people did."
2,watch out!,"If you have any TMJ disorder do not do any of these exercises. Carol instructs you to modify just one exercise, but any of the exercises that ask you to move your jaw will exaccerbate the problem. My condition was aggravated to a point that I will never recover fully."
2,Following the exercises did not yield results for me.,"I have followed the exercises faithfully as described in the book for five weeks and have seen no change. I am suspicious of the promise of results in six days: two of the women in the before and after photos have make-up on in the after photos (not in the before photos) which naturally enhances their looks (e.g. lipstick always makes your lips look fuller). A caller to Dr. Dean Edell, a medical doctor with a radio talk show in Los Angeles, also complained of getting no results and Dr. Edell said that facial exercises do not work.It appears that Facercise works for some but not others. Carole Maggio should have offered this disclaimer in her book.I would appreciate feedback regarding my experience and Dr. Edell's comment."
2,Minimal information,"This book could more easily be a phamphlet. It has very little useful information; it is heavy on very boring personal anecdotes. Lots of fill. Lots of useless pictures of motors and the like. A number of recipes, but most of them you could make up yourself. Example: fish and butter and oregano. Duh! It does cover the basics of how to cook on an enging and what not to do. This could be done in 2 pages."
5,Now packed in with my GPS & Escort & tire plugs.,Should be fun for my passenger to read on a trip. These guys are great and why not be able to have something hot to eat on the road. Just don't forget your tinfoil and condiments.
5,Un gran cuentista,"Carlos Flaminio Rivera con este su segundo libro nos muestra nuevamente como debe ser un cuento, concreto, que amerita varias relecturas, con un manejo adecuado del lenguaje. A pesar se ser poco conocido debe ser leido."
4,Great,Worked just like it said it would. Would recommend if you need to upgrade or replace a power supply on your PC.
2,boring,"Not the story I remember hearing as a kid. This book is very boring, probably because I had better expectations."
5,Better than when I was in 8th grade,"Everyone should read this every 40 or 50 years or so. It's a dear classic, and what Christmas is all about."
3,Not as pictured,"The book I received was not as pictured, but a thick book of 62 of O.Henry's short stories. A bonus perhaps, but not appropriate for the young girl I intended to give it to."
3,Iok,Ok not the greatest but help kill some time.not really my bag .have read better.just did it to get itoff my device.
5,The sacrificial gifts,"I read this story to our children at Christmas long ago. It's a wonderful, heart-warming tale of sacrifices that a wife and husband make for each other. You'll be touched when you read it."
3,A poignant Christmas story about the human love,"In the Gift of the Magi, a young woman sells her most precious property to buy a beautiful Chirstmas gift for her husband. This story is really poignant and the reader feels just like Della. It's a story about love, the real love, the one which passes the material reality. What's more like in many O. Henry's story, we are the witness of his famous surprise endings. This gives the novel a double interest."
3,great story not for younger kids,This is a great story. I purchased it to read to a third grade religious ed class. Most of the vocabulary was WAY over their level.
1,A pretty nice story,"I like this story.The writer wrote people's mien very carefully. I make me feel seemingly I was in the story. It described a poor young woman and a man,they loved each other,they both bought a present to each other,and they used different ways. The same thing was they both sold their things to by the present. So, though they didn't have much money,their mental world was rich."
3,very disappointed,"This version from what I have now read in the reviews, is an edited version. What is disappointing is that there is excerpts for another book at the end of the story. I may delete this from my Kindle. I have sense getting this book, learned to read through all of the recommendations."
3,good love story,It's funny when we think of others before are shelf what a wonderful world this would be and this book is like that love is grand when too people learn to give the most beloved thing they have to the other person
3,The Gift of the Magi,I liked this book but was not carried away with it. I did enjoy that it was short and fast to read.
5,The Gift of the Magi,"If your book club ever considers doing short stories, or if you have a short-story club, consider this one of the must-reads. This story, which has been scripted for TV and movies, is rich with passages that will keep book club members in discussion for several hours. This is a must-read - over and over. There is something to be gained, appreciated, or pondered with each read."
5,Classic,When I first read this to my children when they were young they named several Christmas specials that used the same theme. Nothing beats this classic short story.
2,"Beautiful, but Incomplete","This is a classic Christmas story in our family and is linked to many Christmas traditions; however, I was disappointed in this copy because of its ""editing."" Many parts of the original story were missing for no apparent reason. I did, however, find the illistrations lovely and would recommend this book for that reason."
2,The Gift of the Magi,"The illustrations in this book are absolutely gorgeous, but unfortunately the text adaptation is awkward and difficult to read aloud. Although this is one of my all-time favorite Christmas stories, I ended up returning this book because of the text."
4,The Gift of the Magi,"It was fun to go back and reread this story after many, many years. It's a fast read and a good story to share with kids."
4,A nice daily devotional,I have been reading this devotional for a couple months now and really enjoy the little snippets of advice or encouragement it gives each day. Some days I'm encouraged and other days it gives me something to think about. Very good book if you need something quick.
5,Focus on God daily,An excellent way to start your day with thought provoking lessons for daily living. See how His Word comes through to you through Max Lucado'steachngs.
3,Grace for the moment #1,"I think it is unfair to charge $3.99 postage for each book when they are coming from the same place. Postage, at book rate for three books is not $12.oo. That is highway robbery. I purchased 30 of these books and didnt get NO discount at all."
5,A good read,Max Lucado has a special way of using words to touch and stir the soul and this devotional is no exception. He touches your very soul in this little devotional which is a great addition to any Christians daily reading schedule. A little Max goes a long way with his thought provoking and touching the very deepest places of your soul. A must read and add to your library.
5,Grace when you need it!,"I begin each day with the inspiring scripture and words in Max Lucado's Grace for the Moment. His reflections on scripture are thought-provoking and timeless and always written in an accessible style. I have recommended this book to many and given it as a gift as well. I look forward to his latest addition to the ""daily reflections"" library, Volume II. If you've never read Lucado, you will still love this little book. If you use Grace for the Moment, I can guarantee you'll want to buy more of Max. A prolific prophet for today's ever-changing and confusing world. Max reaches out to his reader in a down-to-earth, every-person language that all can relate to, from Bible scholar to one beginning on the journey. Blessings abound from reading this book every day."
3,Too short for my preference,I find the entries to be too short for me to develop proper mental state and context for daily devotions. Maybe it works well for people who are better-trained (switch on quickly) and has less time in the morning.
5,A fresh touch each day!,"This is an excellent way to start each day. Mr. Lucado's comments seem to come at the right time. His insight is worth thr price. The way he takes scripture and puts it into words to which we can really relate are fantastic. I'd recommend as a gift for a friend, loved one or yourself. Great combination of excerpts from his many books. Got it last year for Christmas and have loved it."
4,Good Product,These pills are as advertised and are great for helping to recover from infections. I take one every day to prevent urinary tract infections.
3,Stuffing issue,"Dog loved this toy, but stuffing came out. Newer similar versions of this toy are ""stuffing-free"" as recommended by pet-friendly organizations."
3,Aspen Soft Bite Plush Hedgehog Dog Toy,"This was one of the gifts that our toy poodle received from us forChristmas. It did not stand the test of time, though, because althoughhe liked it, he did get to picking the hairs off the head and strewingthem around the carpet."
4,title,"We have this game, and bought a copy to take to friends in New Zealand as a house warming gift. Lots of fun for families!"
2,"Fun Game, But...","It's been done before many times under many different names. Does Dutch Blitz, Nertz, Pounce, or Solitaire Frenzy ring a bell? Perpetual Commotion does add a twist with a die roll to determine bonus scoring for the next round, but this alone is hardly worth 20 bucks if you already have a bunch of cards sitting around. Heck, even if you don't have six decks of cards sitting around, you'll be better off picking up the cards and a copy of Bicycle Official Rules of Card Games, you'll get this game plus dozens of others."
3,"Very good game, but very bad quality","We purchased this game this week and tested it last night !We do not know if this is a problem tradution, but the rule of the game is poorly written and difficult to understand.It's very difficult to know ""how to start the game"" just by reading the rule! Thank you for Youtube videos DEMO!POSITIVE :The game is really fun. We had a great time. But if you are 6 peoples to play plan 1H of game instead of 30 minutes as shown in the box.It's funny, fast and really a game room. We loved it !!!NEGATIVE :Quality... Very disappointing ...It's a speed game and quality of the cards are poor !After the second ""round"" lot of cards were already damaged, corners takes off ... Imagine the game after one hour ... ?!?We ended the party has six players with a lot of damaged cards.It will be difficult to keep this game several years without having to buy another one ... which is pretty bad."
5,So much Fun!!,This game was great. My family played it on Christmas Day. It's an easy concept once you figure everything out and it's can get so fast paced. It was a lot of fun trying to beat the other person and seeing your card under theirs on the pile. This game is fun and competitive and great for the whole family. My Dad ended up winning by just 3 points at the end of the game which was great because he had a lot of fun and he is normally not great at board games. I loved it and will be keeping it in regular rotation at my events.
5,Addictive Game,Love this game. Its one of those games where you actually want to play w the kids! Fun for the entire family.
3,Vertiflex Suggestion Box,"This board is an clean and elegant solution to the old suggestion box but needs some improvements. As evidenced in the picture a small corkboard allows enough space to post an 8.5x11 memo. We found the construction to be a little more flimsy than we would like. Since it also only has two mounting holes (one somewhat blocked by the cork board) the unit does not attach to the wall very securely. Also the slots for the blank forms are a little odd sized, requireing use of forms less than 4"" wide. Since Vertiflex does not have a Word/Excel template for the suggestion sheets, we had to create one from scratch. This could have been a lot better with some thought put into the construction."
5,Mikes whatever box,Product worked as planned. Great for helping to give employees a voice in the everyday operations of the workplace.
3,just okay,"The exercises in this DVD are good, very gentle, but I think effective. What I can't understand is why they don't give you enough time to complete the amount of reps they want you to do. After they explain the move, they just move on to the next exercise right away. I have to keep pausing the DVD so I can get all the reps in. Also, the woman's voice is kind of annoying."
4,BackRX,The Doctor makes it easy to understand in his book. He also has very good ideas for the treatment and exersizes.
4,Relief,"the pain was almost instantly relieved. Still have some, but is much better than before I started. Only done twice"
3,Vince Clarke and Andy Bell. Perfect Duo,"These guys make great music. Great songs like Chains of love, Little Respect and Yahoo! remain some of my favorites."
2,Didn't work for me.,"I like Erasure, but I don't love them, because I find that I tend to get bored of the synth-pop sound after a while. I discovered them around the time of Abbaesque. I love that album (although I still need to get a copy of it), and I love the song Always, which I heard on a compilation CD a friend had. Nothing on here is as good as either Abbaesque or Always. I do like A Little Respect, Ship of Fools and Chains of Love. I did like that they took a few chances, such as the instrumental piece Sixty-five thousand, Yahoo! and the cover of River deep, mountain high, but as others have said, the songs didn't work. Overall a slightly below average album that only a die hard Erasure fan would probably like. You also might like it if you're looking for dance music for an 80's party. It's not a good one for just sitting and listening, or even as a workout CD."
2,over-rated and FULL of filler,"So many Erasure fans cite this as their favourite, and I have no idea why. I had it on cassette when it came out, having really enjoyed ""the Circus"", but I found exactly 3 good songs on this. The singles ( of course ) Chains of Love, Ship of Fools, and A Little Respect. The rest are simply awful, especially the ham handed cover of River Deep,Mountain High ( now THAT is a travesty!!) As with WILD!, I say skip this one and go for the POP! cd, which has the singles, and leaves the filler out."
1,quite inaccurate,"Perhaps I was hoping for something more entertaining but it was lacking in that aspect as well as accuracy. It's hard to believe that failing brokers can try to put the blame on an industry that has created so much wealth for investors. Typical to then try and sell a book and make money off investors that he couldn't make money for, blaming not himself for crookedness but the business."
4,Almost as good as his first book,"I first came across Dempsey when I read ""Tricks of the Trade"" a few years ago. That book gave me alot of insight into brokers and what is important to them. I re-read ""Tricks"" after I read Dempsey's second book. Taken together, these two books truly help one learn what NOT to do with investment money (hint: Do NOT trust anyone else with your money. It is your money and you should make the decisions), as well as some advice as to what to do. Every investor should read these two books!"
4,Should have had Seige,I thought Ruin was a good book. It was slow to start off and had huge holes. Maybe if they would have allowed Seige to come out that would not have been a problem. I did not like what they did to Corran Horn in this book. I hope he is redeemed.
5,Dark Tide Ruin,"This is one of the best Star Wars books yet. It continues Michael A. Stackpole's long tradition of powerful descritive novels. It is set 25 years after Star Wars: A New Hope. The Characters face a stunning New threat from extragalactic invaders calling themselves the Yuuzhan Vong. They have a hate of technology and view our heros as blasphemous infidels who must be exterminated. The Jedi battle not only these new invaders but fierce Politicians who wish to gain influence any way possible. When the Jedi find a new way to cripple this threat, they battle to stay alive long enough to use it. This book is full of twists and turns and brings about one of the most extreme thrill rides in all of Star Wars literature."
2,The Worst Star Wars Novel Yet,This has been the worst Star Wars novel yet; for five reasons:1. This is Mike Stakpole's final SW novel. 2. The fall of Captain Corran Horn. 3. Sheado Shai is just a rip off of Nom Anor. 4. Colonel Jagged Fel is just a love intrest for Flight Officer Jania Solo. 5. It's really short
4,Dark Tide: Ruin,Well first I wanted to say that I was not a fan of Onslaught. I thought it was boring and I just pushed myself through it. I am however somehow one of the few people who really liked Vector Prime. Third is that I really liked this book and I thought it had alot of variety. I loved the duel between Corran and Shai and I thought the author played off relationships between certain characters in the books really well. I was slightly irritated by the ever missing Han and the few pages that Leia had. I also wish that he had done more on Jag because I really like the character so far. The banquet chapter was one of my favorites. So if your wondering about this book I just wanted to say that you should read it and that it is my favorite of the three Star Wars books I've read in this series so far.
3,A serviceable end to the duology.,"""Ruin"" is a sufficient, if slightly derivative, conclusion to the ""Dark Tide"" duology. As with the first book, the Star Wars gang splits up, goes on some missions, then bands together in the end for a final battle. The problem with the New Jedi Order books is that they're all starting to read the same. How many times are we going to read about ""dovin basals,"" ""amphistaffs,"" and ""curling lips?"" All the battle scenes are completely indistinguishable from one another and aren't particularly interesting or exciting.To its credit, ""Ruin"" has a pretty good surprise ending, and there are some very interesting things happening to those wacky Jedi kids, notably Jacen. There's some potentially ominous foreshadowing going on with this kid; I'm eager to see if future books pick up on it.In short, don't expect ""Ruin"" to blow your mind away; read it to keep up with the New Jedi Order plot and then move on to the next book."
5,Best one yet,"Ruin is the best NJO novel thus far, and IMHO one of the best Star Wars novels, period. Stackpole as usual has done a great job of characterization and character development, while weaving together other parts of the SW universe and telling the story in a compelling fashion. Particular highlights are Corran's story, the Solo children continuing to mature, and some notable guest appearances... along with several dramatic action sequences.Would suggest that readers who have not read the first two NJO books do so; Ruin does stand fairly well on its own but knowledge of the back story is very helpful."
3,Good but....,Overall the book was one of the better Star Wars books but the thing that let the book down for me was the characterisation of the Solo kids. I realise that they've done alot but never once do they act as 16 year olds do. They constactly act as if they where 35 and this just meant they were completely unbelievable as characters. This isn't just a fault with this book but all the books they have no idea how a 16 year old should behave. This was the only major problem the rest of the book is really quite good has good pace and there some very vivid descriptions. It would have been nice to see more of Han Solo but going to have to wait for that.
2,Mediocre at best...acceptable for the price.,"I started using Amazon groceries to order various healthy snacks directly sent to me in the office. It has paid off enormously as I am in great shape eating lots of high energy food (low/ no sugar) throughout the day and this lets me a very light lunch.That being said I guess I was expecting more from these when I ordered them off of Amazon groceries. The price was right but the biggest problem for these is that they are kind of tasteless. You really need to eat them with something else. The other major problem is that they come all broken and at best 20% of the crackers are intact. You really end up eating the box as a ""cracker chips"". Also the box has no clasps or folds so there is no way to actually close the thing which isn't exactly a bastion for freshness...Bottom Line: They are alright and if your expectations are prepared before getting these you might be surprised."
3,An honest effort by these classy guys,"Better than their next release 21, this opens with the best track on the CD, Heart in pieces, this CD is full of the now standard power ballads. What kind of man, I dont wanna live without your love and We can last forever are all stunning songs - but there is more than one string to Chicagos bow - They also know how to make solid tracks as well. Victorious is the closer and is just awesome. Really a three and a half star performance."
4,something different,"This album may not be like VI, or VII, but I think it's still a good one. This is the first time I got to find out what Bill Champlin was all about. ""Look Away"", ""You're Not Alone"", ""We Can Last Forever"", ""What Kind of Man Would I be?"", and ""I Don't Wanna Live Without Your Love"" are all great songs. Even though Peter Cetera isn't on this album, Jason Scheff and Bill Champlin were great. I think that this is one of the best albums ever in the history of Chicago even though they were different from before."
2,Can't stand it as a whole,"First of all, the recording and mixing engineers did a great job, but ....., there are only moments of repeatably listenable moments of music. The remainder seems more experimental noise of the nervous banging, talking, generally irritating type. I tried several times to listen this as openly as possible, and in the end just feel cheated. Not just out of my money, but out of my time. By the way I came across this DVDA because Amazon shows that people who bought Blue Man Group (BMG) also bought Studio Voodo. They are not even close to the same. BMG is great, this is a bad investment."
2,demo sound but weak music,"i just want to thank ""surroundguy"" for pointing out that while this is clearly arranged for surround sound, the music itself is glossy and ultimately empty, really more demo material. i was reminded of this when i recently saw an older issue of Sound & Vision, which observes that this ""DVD is in fact just a 'surround demo disc'...Multichannel a Go Go..."" Right on. DVD-Audio can be outstanding when both the surround sound and music are strong. this DVD only gets it half right."
1,"A peace of crap at most, sorry","but this DVD was money I wasted after reading the reviews here at ( ). I have a very good DTS-setup (no DVDA). But if you are looking for the performance of 5.1 get some DTS sampler like the Big Picture, Cincinatti Pops (which is far better). And if you like techno variations, you may find them with this DVD as with a lot of other CD’s. As for DVDA – take a real one, with music you like. As a gadget this DVD does not deliver."
5,Nice Galileo Thermometer...,"I've wanted one of these for many years, and saw Amazon had them for sale at reasonable prices. I will admit I was worried about them shipping a glass/liquid container across the country and getting it in one piece. Turns out the nerves were unfounded as it is a pretty sturdy piece of glass, and doesn't feel thin or cheap. Nice looking thermometer, and for a respectable price. I couldn't be happier with my purchase."
4,Shipping issues,"I ordered 2 of these and 1 arrived broken. I exchanged it and received another broken one, so I ended up just returning it and keeping 1 of them.The one that arrived undamaged works great though!"
1,Broken,When I received the thermometer it was shattered and the mercury was all over. I couldn't even take it out of the box. Don't order this item through the mail. Just go get it at Menards.
2,Very outdated card.,"Short and sweet folks. Be leery buying this card unless you have an older operating system (pre-vista) as this card not only does not support vista/win 7, there are no drivers available for it. I'm sure for older operating systems, it may be a decent card, but it is completely unusable on a modern OS.In my opinion, Amazon should force third party vendors to disclose this information in the product description. Granted, I should have done my homework and researched this outside of Amazon, but I didn't. My bad.Sending mine back..."
4,Works well,"You can hook up two monitors to this, and if you already have a graphics card like me you can get a three-monitor system. The monitor connected to the s-video port is great, however on the DVI port (that can also connect with s-video monitors with the included adapter) the only resolutions available are 800x600 0r 1024x768. Still great for the price."
2,Obsolete,"This product is obsolete.I got it to support a larger screen through DVI input on a lightly used (web & typing stuff) older machine that only has PCI slots available.Ability to play HD video was not among my requirements. I quickly found out it should have been. However, this card offers no HW acceleration for HD video and the machine itself is too slow.Doing a little more research, there are PCI (not -E) cards out there that offer more performance and even HD video acceleration for $50 or so.Other than that, the performance is satisfactory for web and typing stuff."
3,does its job,"ony place to get 24"" flashing and had to straighten out some dents from shipping but not too bad-does what it says and at a good price."
1,Overrated,I purchased this show because I am an avid football fan and based on the positive reviews. I watch a lot of shows and movies and know the difference between good and bad. This show is somewhat of a joke to me to be honest. Most reviews comment on how good the acting is and I find it laughable. The stories are not engaging and 90% of the players don't even resemble what NFL players look like. I am shocked at how well this show is reviewed and I feel the exact opposite. If you like good shows with a good story and acting do not buy this.
3,Playmakers,This series gives you a behind the peek idea of what really goes on in those locker rooms. The story lines make you think of the current NFL players who always seem to be in some kind of trouble. Acting is OK; Tony Denison has a few good scenes but not in the show enough for my liking.
5,Playmakers,"This mini series really exposes the side of professional sports I'm sure the owners don't want us to know about. Omar Gooding, as well as the other actors, gave very credible performances. I rented it at Blockbuster and enjoyed it so much I had to buy the Special Edition collection."
5,Great show=Playmakers,Great show that looks behinds the scenes of some of the problems pro football teams and players can have. Actors actually look like guys that play those positions in the NFL. It's a shame that ESPN isn't having another season of it just because it didn't please the NFL and some of it's players.
5,PLAYMAKERS,"This series is absolutely amazing. For viewers to truely hate or love a character, that actor has to be amazing. The actors on this series had YOU wanting to have a go at them. They made you believe their role. There were sooooooo many times that I wanted to just go up to Harris and give him a piece of my mind, bring him to earth, but alas it's television. Tell Leon to chill, let McConnel know that his womanizing will catch up to him, punch Wilbanks and console the coach and the team manager. I am yet to view a sports series like this that had me craving for another episode.This show would have generated new interest in the game from both sport and non-sport enthusiasts. It's such crap that the NFL did not see how great this show was. It may have even drawn people into the game from the publicity of the show, everybody loves scandal or gossip. Lets hope someone else picks this. It is a truely missed series. Truly brilliant ESPN, pity though."
5,Short and Sweet,"Looking for a concise, accurate, intelligent, and detailed history of Russia? Look no farther. This is it. Viewed from the retrospective glance of history, Russia is a different country with a long tradition of lies, torture, economic disasters, and bizarre events (like the horse induced death of Catherine the Great). The crowning achievement of the good old USA was the defeat of the evil empire that was the USSR. Putin succeeded Yeltsin as President. Neither leader has been a model of enlightened libralism. But signs have emerged that Russians may yet generate the energy and the talent to build a better history in the Third Millennium than they contrived in the Second."
3,Too concise,"The book was purchased for a class. The paper is good quality and many photographs, but I feel not enough content for study of this subject."
1,This game is lame,"My 8 year old daughter got this as a birthday gift. We played it as a family for about 15 minutes, and decided that we didn't want to play it anymore. The questions were so silly that we didn't even consider them funny. As a family, we love playing board games, but this is one of the worst we've ever played."
4,Gross...My kids loved it!,"I bought this for my 7-yr-olds to play over the summer vacation and it certainly helped pass the time. Questions are pretty good, although one or two are pretty gross. My kids also liked the part where they had to create their own scenarios. On the downside, the challenges become a bit repetitive, and the game is over quite quickly. Worth it just to hear the rationales of two 7-yr-olds as to why they would choose one gross task over another."
1,Tacky and dumb,"We bought this game 1 year ago. I hate it!! It asks stupid disgusting questions. ""Would you rather have a bottom on your forehead or feet on your ears?"" Huh? Seriously? I think after my kids played it once, their social maturity level dropped 2 years each. The idea would have been great if the developers had used more sensible, less nasty questions. How about ""Would you rather face a shark or a dinosaur in battle? Simple. I am not very creative but my pathetic questions would actually require a little deductive more reasoning! Worst game we have ever purchased!"
3,So-so!,"Not as boring as Would Your Rather, classic version, but close, Fun to a certain extent but they should have come up with more variation in what you do, I was a little dissapointment and regret spending the money for it. I can't believe all the good reviews, we love to play games and the good reviews pulled me in. That won't happen again, I'd never tell anyone to buy this game."
3,"Fun, but a little too gross","We bought this game because the adult version received such great reviews. The premise of this game is fun, but some of the options given were just a little more than I could handle. For example one question read, ""Would you rather drink the spit coming out of a dog's mouth or eat the dog's food at the same time he is eating it."" Another example, ""Would you rather drink the liquid dripping out of a garbage bag or chew on a crunchy hairball found under your couch."" By the end of the game I was thoroughly nausated.Pros: Game moved face. Challenges were a fun feature. Some questions were thought provoking and others were funny. Good for ages 7 and up.Cons: Even my college kid was grossed out. There was no way to separate out the more disgusting questions."
3,Silly Fun But Loses Appeal Quickly,"This game can be played by ages four and up, but mostly boys will appreciate the gross humor of the ultimatums listed inside. Players must choose between two less than desirable alternatives listed on a card and then guess what other players chose. After playing this game twice, my boys were bored with it. Interactive games and thinking games are much more interesting for my family."
4,Kids and adults loved it,"We had so much fun playing it together - both kids and grown ups. Of course, it's a little gross, but it made the kids laugh and gave us great family time."
4,The kids had a lot of fun.,"The sand timer was leaking when the box was opened, it had to have been packaged that way as the the game was still factory-sealed. A food timer works well, and the kids enjoyed the game."
4,Fun for all ages,"We played the game with people ranging from 6 to 65. It was most fun for the 6 and 14 year old, but enjoyable for all. As far as educational value goes, it was good for the 6 yr old to be able to verbalize why he made a particular choice."
1,Confusing for Kids,"Is my family just easily confused? I can't believe the good reviews on this, because I thought the instructions were kind of confusing and the questions were so wordy that the kids were losing track of the bottom line. I would not recommend it, and I am pretty sure it's going to be ""lost"" soon."
1,"Toy for 3 & 5 year olds, did not hold interest, dull!","Was bought for grand children and parents were disapointed, children like games but this did not hold their interests, well advertised though."
2,I wouldn't rather,"I bought this for grandkids, but after a few questions, realized they were having more fun with the off-color questions. I was so embarrassed I couldn't read several of the cards. Not a good, wholesome family game!!!!"
2,Not my favorite chai,"After trying Big Train, Mystic and Enchanted Chai, I have found that Pacific is my least favorite. It has a different flavor in it that I do not care for."
3,New Years Concert 2008,Not your fault but this particular DVD sound track is not quite up to standard on my Stereo System. Sounds fine on regular TV with DVD Player. Would recommedn 2007 version or one of the Boskovsky recordings.
2,I wouldn't recommend this,"It's not terrible. It's just...not very good either. My new year's musical experience would have been ruined if I hadn't owned Kleiber's DVDs of his 1989 and 1992 New Year's Concerts. It's always Strauss, always walzes and polkas, so why don't you just get the best? This one is, well, terribly boring."
5,As advertised!,"It's great to be able to locate nostalgia and collectibles via the internet. I've found things I thought I'd never hear or see again.This group is just an amazing ""poppy"" sounding band from my youth. Jan Errico is an amazing creative talent. It's a little known but absolutely excellent gem."
5,The Funniest Show I Know,I was only able to catch a few installments of Soap during its original run on ABC. So glad to have found this disk available. It arrived in a timely manner and in New condition. Sorry for late input of feedback.
1,Not worthy,"It's a shame that ""Soap"" is out on DVD while the truly funny, groundbreaking show that it lamely attempted to imitate (Mary Hartman) is not yet out. There is no justice in this world!"
4,Missing Episode?,"I bought this 1st season set a few days ago, and have already had my 25-ep Soap marathon. I don't know anything about edited episodes like some other reviewers pointed out. However, I was a bit startled to see that the last ep of the 1st season wasn't on the set, and I distinctly remember at the end of that one, there was a cliffhanger regarding Peter's murder. Am I mistaken? Was that indeed a 2nd season opener? I dont think it was. At any rate, I got my money's worth of enjoyment from this set and look forward to other seasons being released, hopefully containing all episodes."
3,Show Itself Is 5 Stars. DVD itself lacks.,"I love this show it's 5 stars, so the 3 stars is strickly for the DVD and it's lack of features.1-Captions. I'm not hard of hearing, but this is a nice feature.2- Chapters aren't place as well as they could be. Ch1 is the open, Ch2 is the 1st half, Ch3 the second, Ch4 credits.3- No Extras. They couldn't even dig up a few ABC promos. After almost 30 years those would be interesting to see.Show is still funny, holds up very well. Too bad the DVD set ws just cracked out quickly."
5,great fun,I first saw this serie years ago in England.It's even better than I remembered.My 20 years old son is becoming a fan too.I was afraid of problems with the DVD zoning but fairly recents DVD readers are OK
1,The Year The Cassette Tape was made in is wrong.,"The year the Cassette was made in is not 1990 but 1987, because if you look in the booklet inside the cassette tape case it says 1987."
3,Pretty good,About half of the songs here are pretty good. The rest of them aren't worth listening to. They are slow and ponderous and a little boring.
2,So-so translation,"I'm not a big fan of Baudelaire's verse poetry to begin with (his prose poetry is a different matter), and having read Flowers of Evil in French, I was not impressed with this translation. It contains most of the important poems from the original (The Albatross, Her Hair, An Invitation to Voyage, To a Malabar Girl, etc.), so this volume is a good introduction for people unfamiliar with Baudelaire. But someone who genuinely wants to study Baudelaire's poetry would be better off reading James McGowan's translation for Oxford World's Classics."
4,Snatch Game,This game is a fun variation on scrabble. It's great for younger players since the words don't have to be very long and you are not limited to the set arrangement of a scrabble baord.
5,Great Vocabulary-Enhancing Game,"Snatch is a stellar game designed by the Brits and named ""Snatch-It"" in the states. The game is similar to Scrabble, but there is not a limit on the length of words, and words can continue to grow or be combined to form huge words. I advise purchasing this game. If you like the Jumbler from the paper, you may be good at this game. Or if you simply like solving anagrams, this game will be suited for you."
5,MORE THAN A HEATER...,Ceramic Heater- Oscillating HZ-385BP SAFETY SENTINEL ELECTRONIC CERAMIC TOWER.I really neeeded a heater who helped me with my office airconditioner and to be honest I am more than satisfied now with my purchase. I will strongly recomend to anyone this product not only for your offices but for your home also.
2,Why the stupid Beeps & Lights?,"I bought this product yesterday at a local retailer and will be returning it tomorrow. It heats well and quickly. But the list of issues and stupid design decisions with this heater is long.- Every time you push a button the heater beeps VERY loud.- When you turn the temperature set dial, it beeps for every degree change (Very loud)- The fan noise is high and not consistent. I'm not sure if the rapid fan speed changes are ""normal"" or if my unit is broken.- There is a blue light strip that is for looks only. Which if you use this to heat a room when you go to sleep, it adds light to the room for no reason.Without the beeps I would consider keeping the unit. But the beeps are just crazy loud and there's no reason for them."
2,Defective thermostat; poor quality,"Like many of the reviewers here, both of the units which I attempted to use showcased abnormal thermostat activity. While the temperature in a room would vary between 68-70 during my tests, the heater itself would display temperatures ranging from 66 to 85, sometimes within the space of an hour. Power cycling the heater seemed to temporarily reset this behavior, so the problem is definitely not poor thermostat placement next to the heat source. Additionally, one of the two models simply failed to run when on the energy-saver mode. I can only guess that this entire line of space heater was created to use up a large number of defective thermostats. In conclusion, this would be a great heater -- except for the total lack of temperature regulation, and the all-to-real concern that if the unit can't even tell the temperature, how can it be trusted to have a working over-heating fail safe?"
1,Defective,"Heating is out in our Brooklyn Apartment. Bought this at target. Worked for about 2 seconds before smoke came out. Fancy digital display works fine, but no heat.Maybe this is a rare occurrence, but I am not looking forward to another trip to return this in the middle of the Sandy crowds."
3,sensor shut off functionality,"Heat is excellent. The thermostat is not ""set it and forget it"". They way it works it creates a very large temperature swing and I had to often turn the unit on or off manually.The sensor - it you want to turn off the safety sensor, there is a switch, but you have to turn if off every time you turn on the unit, which is a pain. I have animals and they can trigger the sensor if I leave it on."
4,Fantastic!,"After reading some of the negative reviews of this product, I was a bit wary about buying, but it was recommended to me by a source I trust.As it turns out, there is NO beeping sound when the temperature changes, and as for the annoying light...I've had alarm clocks that were worse than the light from the tower heater. If the light bugs you, all the more reason to snuggle under the blankets. I love being able to set the timer on the heater and crawl under the blankets, and not having to crawl out to turn it off!"
5,JAMC B sides are better than many groups official albums,This was the first J&MC album I got - and like the real special albums it still sounds fresh and interesting whenever I get back to it.Still one of the best albums I have in my collection.
1,i bought it because jimmy eat world dropped their name,"This is the worst album I've ever purchased. If I wasn't going to return it, I would burn it."
4,Great Product,Once you learn how to install these plugs they are great! Make hookups a lot simpler! Sound improved!
4,Lost Scriptures,This book serves a very useful function in bringing to the lay public those ancientscriptures of Christianity not included in the New Testament.
2,NOT AS INTERESTING AS I ANTICIPATED,I have recently been doing a lot of Biblical research and ordered this book. I can easily see why these books were not included in the New Testament. Don't waste your money.
1,The Title is An Oxymoron,"Since all scripture is breathed out by God and preserved by God, it cannot be lost."
4,Excellent collection,"Ehrman's Lost Scritures recieves high marks as a thorugh collection of early christian writings, covering most of the recorded diversity of the various sects. The translations, generally excellent, allow the reader considerable access to the period. Unfortunately, the introductory essays for each of the writings are not up to snuff, often terse and providing little background. While the author clearly intendended this as a companion addition to his other volume on early christian sects, the introductions should have been stronger. Particullarly vexing is that, as in the other volume, he dates varrious writings without laying out the reasoning for the date given. ""Scholars estimate..."", a term repeated frequently, leaves the reader wanting more details and a hearing of the case.Despite this short coming, a collection like this is a must for anyone interested in christian antiquity."
5,Better than a lot of other attempts.,"With a lot of Neo-Gnosticism flaring up, it's good too see a collection of their early writings without major commentary of any kind, though the historical intro is intersting. Best read with his book titled Lost Christianities."
4,Lost Scriptures,"I have always heard of the many book that had not made the ""final cut"" to the Bible. Erhman gives a brief synopsis at the beginning of each new book. In reading another of Ehrman's books one realize why some of these books did not make it into the Bible and why some of the books would never be appropriate for the New Testament"
3,I had to know the whole story,"As a ""scientific Christian"" I was plagued by the question: why did the Bible contain the select number of entries published. What about all the other ""prophets""? I wasn't satisfied with the concept that the Bible was a manifestation of God's will; it simply went through too many human hands. Reading this partially helped satisfy these questions. You can easily see that many Lost Books were fanciful copycats of the time. Although some of these Lost Books might fit into the Bible as we know it, others are tangential novelettes that take off into another universe."
5,"""Noncanonical"" works","Unlike many books concerned with what is, or isn't, considered ""canonical"" in the New Testament, this book just contains the works themselves, or the portions of the works that have been found to date. It is quite an interesting compilation, and covers a variety of topics. As a layman, and not a theologian, I could see why most of these works were not included in the New Testament, particularly the gnostic texts, which were extremely strange! What amazed me, however, were some of the ""gospels"", which contained tales of Jesus that I remember being told to myself and my parochial grade school clasmates by our nun teachers. Apparantly, they were aware of these unauthorized writings, and even though they weren't considered ""orthodox"" enough to go into the Bible, the nuns must have read them somewhere! Just another one of life's little mysteries!"
4,Lost Scriptures,"This book is well written and easy to read. At numerous places throughout the text, the author uses special characters i.e.; ( ), [ ] and < > to enclose some text. I have not found an explanation printed in the book to explain their meaning. Several days ago, I wrote an email message to Mr. Ehrman requesting an explanation for their use, but to date, no reply received from him."
3,Informative but not insightful,I was disappointed in the far too brief commentary on the very interesting non-canonical scriptures included in this book.
5,Great tube,This tube is great. Easy to pump up. Very durable. And it looks nice when we used it on a pond. We bought a second one right after because the kids were waiting too long to share it. Highly recommend.
4,Decent Tubes at a practical price,"I bought two of these two years ago. They were great for the first summer. We didn't have any problems. We took them down a river over some rough terrain several times. They were great. Last summer we discovered that one of the tubes ripped. We patched it, but had no success in keeping it inflated. The other tube was still fine and made another trip down the river."
1,Color Whirl Tube,"Bah! When we received this pool tube, there were holes in it so it couldn't be blown up. Worthless purchase. I would not buy this product again.Intex Color Whirl Tube, 47-Inch"
2,Not a river tube.,"I bought this product because it came up in my search for a ""river tub."" we inflated thems and they seemed to be great until we started to go down the river. the first rock my daughter glided over it got a nice tear in it and that was it....the other two out of the 4 had to have air put in twice before we reached our ending point. They are great for just floating in but not for floating down the river as I had"
5,Very good tube for the pool,Very happy with this inner tube. It's definitely thicker than the ones I can pick up at the local store. Kids love it in the pool. Big enough for adult use too.
1,Don't Bother,"Bought this for my daughter. Took it out of the box, blew it up (lung power only, no machines) and by the time we walked 20 ft. to the lake, the tube had deflated. Found the hole and patched it, following all directions. She was then able to use it for approximately 45 min. before it started deflating again, this time w/ more holes. The seams just aren't strong enough. Disappointing."
4,"The Reason, 3.5 Stars","After hearing ""The Truth"" album when it first was released I couldn't wait for his second album to be released. The album kicks off with the Kanye produced ""Nothing Like It"" which is one of pain tracks he gives on his albums, other joints to check for are Beanie (Mack B****),""I Don't Do Much"", ""Think It's a Game"", ""Man's World"", ""Mom Praying"", ""Still Got Love for You"" and ""What Your Life Like 2"". The main issue with this album was the weak hooks and out of place songs like EPMD remake ""So What You Saying"", ""Watch Your Bi**hes"", & ""For My Ni**as"". Overall its a solid album 3.5 Stars"
3,could be a lot better,has a lot of banging songs that have some meaning but some of his cursing is a little un needed but very good still. it has some real bangin tracks on it...his beats r better than his lyrics but his lyrics arent that bad...but they could have been better prepared with a few more songs....get his first cd...THEN this 1
5,Best CD Ive heard in a while,"From the first time I listened to this, I knew it was an instant classic. Its got everything from slow, deep songs to party songs, to, of course, gangsta songs about drugs, guns, and the sort. If you like rap, get this NOW, this is a CD you can listen to all the way through."
3,The Reason - why out fell off this one,"Not to sound too critical, but this one was rather dissapointing, compared to his first release, ""The Truth"", now he has given us a reason why this LP is not as equally impressive as his previous work. Although it didn't really dissapoint overall, there is enough material to keep you going, for instance the introspective (""Nothing Like It"") or the emotion-filled (""Mom's Praying"") and (""I Still Got Love For You""), but that's not enough to save the whole album."
1,tale of a sucker,"yo, this cd really blows... the beats are pathetic and the vocals are self praising. when i throw the record on the turn table i can almost get it not to suck... but then it is an impossible task. My advice is never buy, PLEASE DON""T BUY IT!!!!!"
2,typical bling bling,"yea, if you like p diddy and all the other weak emcee's who can't get over the new found money, you'll probably like this. but if you prefer true talent and thought, more like a del the funkee homosapien or el-p of company flow or cage or necro or even the late big-l (RIP), you'll find this cd disappointing. and to fans of big-l, you'll be horrified by the diss of big-l by this weak emcee. true hip hop fans should spit on beanie when they see him, he's a punk and a no-talent, and if he comes to DC, that is exactly the treatment he will get."
3,pretty good,"Overall, I didn't care for this CD. First and foremost, they talk about the samne things in every songs. Chopping coke, to holding glocks, and shooting. It gets to repetitive. Beanie is nice and all, but I couldn't stand it. Mom Praying was my fav. track on the album. It had a nice beat to it. Plus, the lyrics were nice. This album sounds like the first album, but with less good beats. If you into rawness, and hardcore gangsta rap like dat, this is a definent """"MUST GET""""!! You peeps will enjoy it. But if you already got the first album, no need to get this one."
4,good book,my cusin gave me this for christmas and i read it and i likeed it. it was good and scary and made me scared and yu shood read it to!
2,This is a violent book,"I liked every part of this book, especially the sex parts. But I didn't like the violence parts. There was just too much violence and gore. Why did he have to put that in? It would have been better without it. Two stars, but without the violence (and more sex--a lot more sex), four stars. You see?I hate violence."
4,A rare treatise on the subject,"This is an excellent work on the controversy between Covenant and Dispensational Theology. Stripped of some extreme technical language, it is nevertheless well-thought out and scholarly, while accessible to those outside of Biblical scholarship. I would perhaps have preferred a more technical handling of the subject, but for the vastness of the subject, the main thoughts both of the proponents and opponents of Dispensational theology are summarized without doing injustice to their viewpoints.Given the nature of some dispensationalists as of late, (ie. Dave Hunt), I was very pleased that this was not a Calvinism bash-fest either. In fact, Dr. Showers even seems to defend (or at least not attack it) the doctrine of the Eternal Decree. The only thing that prevented me giving that fifth-star was its intended audience, which seems to be the theologically inclined but undereducated.For those who want to know my biases, I am both dispensationalist and Calvinist."
2,Not what I hoped for,"I'm not a theologian, but I have a good understanding of theological issues. I bought this book hoping to understand the differences between covenant and dispensational theology. The book is not bad, but I still have no idea what the differences are. The first couple chapters have some explanation then the book goes into other issues, such as the millennium. These issues are presented in a good manner but they don't answer the question of how covenant and dispensational theology differs in the view. Perhaps this book is meant for someone who already has a pretty clear understanding of the issues."
4,What's the Big Deal,"Dr. Showers treats his readers to a powerful contrast between covenant and dispensational theology. Although the work is not without its flaws, it is well worth the time of the reader to study it thoroughly and to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the systems presented therein. The work begins by laying out the systems of Covenant and Dispensational theology. The next section deals with the various covenants and how the Dispensationalist views their application today and in the future. The third section discusses millennial views, and the last section deals with various teachings such as the kingdom of God, the origin of the church, and the relationship between the law and the Christian. Overall, the book forms a valuable introduction to Dispensational theology. Keep in mind that this work is designed more for Dispensationalists who are trying to grasp the complexities of the Covenant system and to understand in what manner they differ."
1,Olympus has DISAPPOINTED me.,"I've used Olympus cameras for over 10 years now.This one if my 5th model. This is the worst camera ever!! I bought it right before going on vacation .Since it says it's underwater OF COURSE I tried it out!! After taking some beautiful pictures little fish and corals ,it died!!! All false advertising .I went 2 feet deep and I was less than 10 minutes underwater!! The camera did nothing else after that. It only lasted me a total of 10 days. Luckily I didn't lose the pictures in the memory card . This camera does not live up to the Olympus name.The worst part is Camelata Photo won't take it and they passed me over to deal with Olympus. Even ""IF"" Olympus replaces this horrible camera I will never be able to depend on it to document my memories.That's not to mention the waiting,the phone calls,back and forth and all the inconveniences I'm left to deal with minus the$$$."
5,The greatest of all the Anime legends,"This is pure gold, they dont make Anime like this anymore. This is the movie which started the animation boom in Japan. This first film is a compilation of the 26 episodes of the first Yamato TV series ( Starblazers-Quest for Iscandar ). Its better to view this film after viewing the original TV series. Without this film there would never have been a Macross (robotech), Galaxy Express etc.......This film is IT. The Star Wars of Japan comparitively speaking."
5,these are great,"I ordered these after reading reviews on different gloves and am completely satisfied with them. They are so durable I use them for other chores as well, such as filling and cleaning bird feeders.The large size is perfect for my large hands.This is a great product and is highly recommended for its intended purpose and other dirty or messy chores as well."
3,Not well made,Bought these for when I'm making sausages.I guess you get what you pay for. The gloves are not made correctly though large enough for my big hands they are to tight at the base of the fingers and always rip when I put them on.For the price I'll just use them loosely on my hands.
2,Disposable gloves,"I was very happy about the price so what could go wrong? I bought them to clean dog poop. I quickly found out the finger tips are not sealed. Dog poop, hamburger meat, or what ever you use them for go right through the finger tips."
3,"great item, great price!","Great item at a great price. I wanted to use these for a Halloween party (popcorn hands, hand ice cubes etc...) and these were perfect! Exactly what I needed!"
1,Don't buy this iron.,I bought this iron in December 2002 and it has never worked properly. It shuts itself off in about a minute or two leaving watermaks on whatever I am ironing. It will not come back on unless I unplug and replug it. I am sending it back to Braun.
3,Not Impressed,"I've used this iron for a couple of weeks now and really it does no better than the $25 Black & Decker I used to have. This one has more ""bells and whistles"" but really other than good steam I don't need a fancy looking iron. And that extra plate thingy they give you is a waste...in my opinion, I'll never use it.There are also some problems with water spots/drips onto the fabric even after the iron is warmed up. I bought it at Bed Bath & Beyond for $60 so that's the only reason I'm keeping it :) If I ever need another iron I'll get a Rowenta."
1,Bad Product,"I am on my second iron. They all shut off and do not turn back on, result water shoots out and stains clothes.My second one will be returned ASAP."
5,"Clear, Exquisite French Cooking Display","From the cover one is in for a treat, both to the eye and palate. The photography in this cookbook is simply gorgeous. How can one take a shot of a man holding a rooster in front of a bin of corn and make it look like a million dollars? It's here.The recipes are the best of the tradition which the French are world famous for. Here are stressed the best in ingredients, cooked lovingly with patience and care and technique to bring out their succulence from French Regions.Feast on such as ""Cod and Vegetables with Garlic Mayonnaise"" ""Stuffed Breast of Veal"" ""Lyon Style Onion Soup"" ""Veal Stew"" ""Pears in Beaujolais.""Truly Bon Appetit."
3,A master chef points us to the basics,"Master chef Paul Bocuse compiled this book of signature regional French recipes. He presents them in an uncomplicated form to show the essence of the dish. This means these are not his five-star Paris reinterpretations of these dishes. A selection of beautiful photographs show good presentation for about half the recipes.I found the majority of the recipes taste good as presented, and are robust enough to support reinterpretation by imaginative cooks. There may be more comprehensive collections of regional French cooking. But I think Bocuse has met his goal of explaining regional cooking well enough to begin a discussion of how it should influence the search for excellence.This book contains over 100 recipes, of which about 40 caught my eye. Many others that seemed just OK may turn out great. But overall these recipes describe very traditional dishes, so you can find similar recipes in a wide variety of sources."
2,"Great Chef, but you can do better","I think Paul Bocuse a great and masterful chef, but he has created a book of delicious, yet average, unenlightening fare. I must recommend as a better choice Anne Willan's Regional French Cooking. It is out of print, but I found a nice hardcover on Amazon. The book goes into beautiful details of each French region (divided into 12 regions) covering history, climate, and idiosyncrasies and their effects on the food of that area, with wonderful representative recipes from hors d'oeuvre through dessert. There are many photographs, but few of the dishes for which she has recipes (this is the only fault). It is not glossy nor as breathtaking as her ""Chateau Cuisine"" or ""From My Chateau Kitchen"", but every bit as charming and instructive. If you want to learn about France through its food you can't do better. I hope they reprint it someday. [...]"
1,Just awful,"Got this at a David's Bridal actually and I hope I can warn others off. This is just an absolutely wretched collection, while the songs themselves are all classics, these performances of them are simply awful. I don't think there's a single real instrument on here, this is clearly all done with either a cheesy Casio synthesizer or a cheap MIDI program on somebody's home pc. The songs like Butterfly Kisses and Unforgettable are not the original artists, but instead are performed by ""The Hit Crew"" and are a huge disappointment if you were expecting the real songs. These aren't even good cover versions of the songs, they're obviously slapped together with the assumption that the buyer won't be able to listen to them before purchasing.There are lots of great wedding collections here on Amazon, but this is NOT one of them."
5,TOUCHES ALL BASES,"This book examines every type or form of spiritual healing, including Reiki, LeShan, Qigong, dowsing, craniosacral therapy, the Bowen technique, Barbara Brennan healing, Polarity Therapy, Shen healing, healing touch, etc. Spiritual healing is defined as a systematic purposeful intervention by one or more persons aiming to help another living being by means of focused intention, hand contact, or ""passes"" to improve their condition.The author states that he was a skeptic, but that personalexperiences and research have convinced him that spiritual healing really exists and is a potent therapy. The book contains 124 scientific studies supporting various methods of spiritual healing.Many well-known healers, such as Harry Edwards, Ethel Lombardi, and Dr. Ursula Thuberg are mentioned and their methods and approaches discussed. In 597 pages, the author seems to have touched all bases in providing proof that spiritual healing works. It is more than a book. It is an encyclopedia."
5,Using Science to Prove the Miraculous,"In ""Spiritual Healing, Scientific Validation of a Healing Revolution,"" Daniel Benor, M.D. uses the scientific method to demonstrate that spiritual healing works and thereby takes a giant step toward remedying the problem that Descartes created when he separated mind from matter. In his clearly written book, Dr. Benor uses the tools of logic and Western science to make a compelling case for the existence of the miraculous. By using science to validate spirit, Dr. Benor is signaling the end of the Cartesian split and indicating that we are rapidly moving toward a more integrated view of ourselves and our relation to the world. Although ""Spiritual Healing"" is a comprehensive reference book that will be consulted for many years, I found that it was very enjoyable reading. I was particularly drawn to the chapter in which numerous healers describe how they heal and their beliefs about spiritual healing."
5,"Richard Gerber, M.D.",I find the book to be an excellent resource on research in healing. Some of the studies quoted in Dr. Benor's book I can find nowhere else. I refer to this book often. It is well-written and contains much valuable information.
5,exceptional value,This faucet is extremely reliable and sturdy. The lever maneuvers with ease and it goes nicely with my sink and kitchen decor. The side sprayer is great as well allowing water to hit every angle of the sink when rinsing.Installation was a breeze. I highly recommend this faucet for the price.
2,Great design but not reliable,"A search of available steam irons in retail stores convinced me this is the best design and value available. I bought it. Unfortunately, with less than 2 months of use, the temperature control has become defective, and there is no reasonable way to get this replaced. So, not such a good value for me. Sad."
1,Lovely iron...but now no steam!!!,"I loved this (expensive-even-on-sale) iron, but after less than 2 months of use, and light use at that, it no longer steams. Sigh. How hard can it be to make an iron that keeps steaming? Back to the drawing board, Braun..."
3,everybody's still free,"Now this is interesting, seeing Rozalla play sidekick on her own song! Still, these UK mixes are great and much better than the 2000 US version by RHV. Pearl Young's mixes are harder but never aggressive and keep Rozalla's beautiful vocals intact."
5,Mamma Roma,"In his first feature film, Pier Paolo Pasolini uses a neorealist aesthetic to critique petit-bourgeois mores, training his sights on a poor outcast who strives and fails to become a respectable member of Italy's postwar society. Played to triumphant perfection by the fiery Anna Magnani, Mamma Roma is a hearty, proud woman willing to do anything for her boy, and Ettore Garofalo is appealing and believable as her son. An early gem by an Italian master, ""Mamma Roma"" is a moving, perceptive study of how love and sacrifice can still lead to an unjust outcome."
2,an early Pasolini film.,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Mamma Roma is the story of a prostitute in Italy who quits her job to be with her son but keeps being hounded by her pimp.I found the film to be dull and not as interesting as some of Pasolini's earlier films. The film does have some nice scenes of suburban Rome but that is about the only part worth mentioning.The DVD has some nice special features though.Disc 1 contains the film, with a theatrical trailer and a poster galleryDisc 2 contains an hour long biographical film on Pier Paolo Pasolini, a 35 minute early film by Pasolini starring Orson Welles titled ""La ricotta"" about a filmmaker doing a portrayal of Christ's crucifixion, and interviews with Bernardo Bertolucci, Tonino Delli Colli, and Enzo Siciliano, about Pasolini.I suggest this film for Pasolini fans only."
3,Finally recieved DVD,This DVD finally arrived on Dec 24th as I was told in the new email changing the arrival date from the original date after contact them when it didnt arrive. Was packaged good and arrive new in box and in good condition. ty
3,It's O.K.,"I would have preferred this CD to be in a book format instead of a soundtrack. It would have been less expensive to buy and easier to use that way. The first CD, which is one hour long talks about breathing & health but I really didn't find it interesting or informative. I was rather bored. I thought everything he said was common sense and there was no fresh information. Basically this first CD is a one-time listening thing, so not really worth the purchase. My problem with the second CD, which has the 7 breathing exercises, is that it's one hour long and there is no way to ""jump"" between exercises 1 to 7. It is all one track. In the accompanying 6-page CD booklet all the exercises are very clearly explained and detailed in text... so you don't really need the CD at all! On the up side, I'm glad there are exercises out there on this subject that Dr.Weil made available to me. I have not been doing the exercises long enough to notice any changes yet."
5,Tape was great,"This tape was great. I have bought two. Having to review this process ,or it hurts the seller makes me not want to do this again"
1,Bogus,"This cd suffers from it's author reading..and..pronouncing..very ..carefully..each..word..in..the..sentence. It has no flow and sounds forced and artificial, not like someone talking smoothly and naturally to you. I couldn't relax, nor get over the stilted sound of the narrative.Plus, Andy Weil is such a big (literally, he's fat) star, that there's no heart or caring in his materials. I don't think he walks his talk."
4,I enjoyed this audiobook very much,"I found this audiobook very helpful. I like Dr. Weil's approach. It has helped me remember to take time to de-stress through mindful breathing. And it works! One problem--I wish the first CD had been divided into individual tracks. Instead, it is a single track that is nearly an hour long. That makes it very difficult to find your place if you get interupted. I accidently ejected the CD and had to begin again, but I had to hold down the Fast Forward button on my player for quite a while to get back to where I had previously left off - that's ridiculous. Overall, it's worth the purchase."
3,Does the job but seems a little flimsy,"I got this to monitor fuel pressure on a carbureted engine. Once installed it seems to work fine, but I question how accurate and durable it is. The Tee and lens on the gauge are plastic and seem easy to break or melt. However mine doesn't leak and has been doing the job for a few months now. It reads 7psi at idle for a mechanical pump, which seemed a little high to me. It is nice and small, and fine for a daily driver. I wouldn't put this on a hotrod or show car. Very useful to monitor vapor lock potential."
4,product was delievered in a very timely manner and was to my expectations,The product fit my project as expected. Works very well. Would suggest this product where space is a premium. Great Item
2,mas o menos,por los momentos marca bien la presion solo que la tapita del reloj es muy debil y no esta bien sujeta cada rato se sale y ya se partio
5,"If you are thinking of having a baby, this is a must read!",This book is very informative and thoroughly explains conception and what you should do if you are having problems.
2,Not enough solid information and poorly organized,"I bought this book because I wanted to know what I could do to increase my odds of conceiving quickly. While there's some good information in the book, there's also a lot of less than reliable information that's not backed by hard facts. To make matters worse, the book is poorly organized so you have to really hunt and peck to find what you're looking for.I highly recommend Toni Weschler's ""Taking Charge of Your Fertility"" and John Sussman and Ann Douglas' ""The Unofficial Guide to Having A Baby"" as alternatives to this book."
1,Just plain flaky,"This is the worst book on getting pregnant I've ever read, and I've read a lot. It's poorly organized, badly written, and filled with outlandish suggestions that aren't based on hard facts or proven scientific studies. Save yourself some disappointment by passing on this particular book."
2,"Some valuable information, some not.","This book contains a great deal of ""bad science"" and alarmist theories. Readers should proceed with caution and not be frightened by every ""don't"" this book details."
2,As if you weren't worried already...,"This book does have some good information and I use it occasionally as a reference. However, it focuses so heavily on all the obstacles to getting pregnant, that it's downright depressing. After reading just the few chapters, I was in tears. A good friend had the same reaction and marched back to the store to return the book. I don't blame her. Having turned to more positive books & found lots of good advice there, we're now expecting our first! Good luck!"
1,Not Very Good,We use several different brands of USB-Serial and they all seem to have some issues but we could not get this to work at all on 2 different computers. I will cut one up and try to find a cause but I wouldn't recommend it. One product I would recommend is the Belkin F5U109 which I have never had a problem with or a customer complaint although it is pricy.
3,Works OK but,I bought several of these to use as a comm port for testing and communicating with equipment at work. Most of them worked fine but I did have 1 or 2 out of 8 that didn't work very long.
1,Product causes my computer to bluescreen,"The product causes my computer to bluescreen. I'm on a Windows 7 64 bit system. You also have to manually find the drivers you need to install which, while not a big deal, is a tad annoying when other wires which cost less will automatically install drivers once you plug them in."
4,It works,For the price it was a good buy. It is a little floppy when you clip it to your belt but if you turn it sideways it fit nicely. The design is good as you have access to everything. The protective plastic screen cover works well. All in all a good buy.
3,not designed for the treo 700wx,The hole cut out for the camera didn't line up. I also found that dirt can get under the plastic for the touch screen because of the opening on top for the sd card.
3,Not as good as it looks,"It's a decent phone case, just keep in mind a couple of things1) It's made of rubber...so looks a little cheap2) The clip is good but my phone does drop off the belt at times(rarely)"
5,I Don't Know What these Guys are Talking About,"From a hip hop junkie and expert, this is the best hip hop ablum ever made, up there with Paid in Full, Illmatic and Wu Tang 36 Chambers and Midnight Maruaders from the Tribe. ""The Day You're Mine"" may not be a good example of wonderful singing, but the lyrics remain awesome, and the production is great, and it adds musical diversity. An unbelievable producer (Marley Marl) and one of the best MCs, maybe the best, to ever live on the mic. How can you go wrong?"
4,damn near 5 stars,"with the exception of ""the day you're mine"", every track is RAW! kane's lyrical terrorism is in the league of krs and rakim, damn near unparaleled. if i could give this album 4 and a half, i would, but you've got to keep your 5's for criminal minded, paid in full, and strictly business. kane's right up there, but maybe i'm biased due to the fact that he eventually would strive to be on the charts (in his words:) ""with new kids on the block and paula abdul"". forgetting all of that, this is definitely in my top 15 or 20 all time favorites (and i've got a issssh load of the old stuff). if you are a self-proclaimed rap fan, you need to buy this album-without a doubt. in fact, why don't you have it already? BEWARE of ""certain"" future Kane albums."
4,Someone Had To Get It Started,"In the late 80's ""Kane"" came off as one of the greatest rappers of all time. He made the game what it is today! He ""flowed"", ""boasted"", and ""hyped-up"" every house party. Raw was just that, ""R.A.W"". Then ""Set it Off"", whoo wee. Kane showed that you could be a dark skinned brotha and be smooth by the way he dressed and performed. He was the Denzil Washington of HipHop. With the production of Mister Cee, they were the dream team. Mr. Cee discovered BIGGIE for those who didn't know. So this album is a classic; I got it, U should get!"
1,Jen's Review,"In my perspective, this was a bad book. It had no point to it! It was boring how she didnt talk to anyone for about a year or more. This book could be improved if Marina had one person she would tell her thoughts to and share her emotions with. I would not recommend this book to anyone who likes books with a good story line."
1,So much to tell you,"In my opinion the book ""so much to tell you"" was horrible the plot was ok but it was a major disapointment at the end. The characters were to boring and it was very hard to understand. I woulnd not recomend this book to anyone."
3,So Much To Tell You,"I sort of liked this book because in some parts in was interesting and the chapters are short. I don't like books with long chapters. I disliked this book because in some parts it was hard to understand what was going on. I would reccomend this book to pretty much anyone who like to read, but if you don't like to read, read it anyway, reading expands your mind."
3,not as detailed as I had hoped,"This is an interesting book, but it doesn't have the amount of interesting detail that I would have hoped to see about each pharaoh. The illustrations are nice, however."
5,Amazing and Interesting Book,"I have been searching for a book all over the Internet on all Egyptian pharaohs from the beginning to the end. However, it was quite hard until I came to Amazon and found this book.I tell you Amazon has every book you are looking for!I read the reviews, and ""looked"" in the book.I bought it, and I tell you that this is one of the best comprehensive book ever! It is in great detail and has many colored pictures.I would suggest anyone to get this book because it makes a great detail reference and information on the pharaohs."
5,Not Since Henry,"Like the aforementioned Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, Snowtown is an unrelenting look at the reality of serial killers. There is no glamour, no elegance in what they do and this is presented perfectly in the long stark scenes that make up much of the film. Writer Shaun Grant and Director Justin Kurzel offer no explanation for why Bunting and his followers did what they did, there is none, they simply did."
3,just ok,Movie was ok. It was bit hard to understand heavy dialect of the actors but could get the overall giest of the movie.
2,it is ok,"It is informational, so that alone makes it ok to watch. As for storytelling, the director should have seen to it that the movie was edited. So much is being told that I got lost. It didn't do a great job in keeping my interest. I didn't feel sorry for the victims or the the young man that was later recruited."
2,Really?,"I was expecting to be disgusted..... I was not. I have seen worse. As a matter of fact, they could play this movie unedited on fx."
3,Looking forward to seeing this.,I did not get a chance to see this movie. There was a problem with the dvd and I have yet to reorder.
3,The Snowtown Murders,This film was very slow and somewhat difficult to understand ( with the heavy accents ).It delivered on that is was a disturbing story.
2,It could have been great but. . .,"This had the potential of being an exceptional novel but it never quite makes it. The contemporary story of Sarah is thin and cliched compared to the richness of the story of the Belgards in Germany. I found myself not caring what happened to Sarah except as her life related to her grandmother--and there wasn't much of that. That is, perhaps, the biggest problem with the contemporary scenes: the characters are all treated superficially, especially in comparison to the WWI-era chapters.The idea (at least I think this was the point--it's not too clear) that one can never truly know what really happened, in the lives of our parents, grandparents,and other relatives, before we knew them, is very interesting and certainly worthy of exploration, but it's treatment falls flat here. At the end of the book, my reaction was ""Oh, well""."
3,Successful use of switching context,"I guess i bought this book with expectations of eclecticism, sublime phrasing, depth of expression. I was disappointed on those fronts, but nonetheless enjoyed the book. It flows well. Unlike many novels which switch from one historical period to another, back and forth, this works exceptionally well, with one chapter ending and the reader desiring more. It's definitely an engrossing page turner. Literary? Maybe not. I think I was expecting less-obvious treatment of the family dynamics and character struggles. Some of it is extremely predictable, like the dialogue between the main character, a pregnant single mother, and her best friend Pam, or her ex-lover Mike. The scenes of the father painting her seemed a little too easily extracted from autobiography and I wondered what if anything it added to the development. Those passages were the ones I liked least."
4,Colors Never Die,"If you like this soundtrack you should buy the book DO OR DIE. This book is the paper (and real life) version of the movie. As for the soundtrack It gives the flavor of street life, intermixed with a wishy-washy dont't gangbang vibe. But for true Ballers Ice-T and Big Daddy Kane don't dissapoint."
3,Baby Maya,"I agree with the previous reviewer. Los Lobos would have been nice on the Soundtrack. However, does anyone out there know the title and artist of the song that is playing in the movie when the Hispanic gang is partying and is the victim of a drive by. If so please repsond. I have been trying to find this song for years."
3,"Where's"" One Time One Night "" by Los Lobos?",This was without a doubt the best song featured in the movie so why wasn't it on this soundtrack? There were Hispanic gang members in this movie so one song by the great band Los Lobos would have hardly been inappropriate.Just wondering.
2,Dingo Pictures,"I know it's from Dingo Pictures, the same German based company who brought us The Lion and His Son 2 (Son of The Lion King) and many other ""Diznee"" movies. The dubbing reminds me of that of Dingo Aladdin, recorded on tape I presume."
1,Dim light...,"The product description leads you to believe that this is just like flipping the light switch on/off, depending on the ambient light.Not so. The bulb is much dimmer with this device than it is when plugged directly into the socket. Plus, it flickers at dusk. And I can't imagine that anyone would want this. Maybe you can compensate by buying a higher-wattage bulb, but even if that worked that is a pain. Thanks, Ace, for selling me this shoddy product and forcing me to make another trip to your store so I can return it.Just in case anyone at Ace or Hemco is reading this...we want the bulb to look exactly like it does when plugged directly into the socket...duh."
4,Help for busy teachers,"I've been using Teachers Tool Box (3.0, 4.0 and now 5.0) and find it to be a great help. Version 5.0 seems to be the same as 4.0, so there is no reason to upgrade. One of the best progams I've found for teachers!"
2,"Good for Windows users, but medicore for Mac users","The features are easy to use and very useful. It makes simple the creation of a seating chart and the tracking of grades. However, I write this warning to Mac users that the Test Creator, Lesson Planner, and Report Card Generator and the capability to link to rschool.com are not available to us. This is stated on the bottom of the box.The CD contains Teacher's Toolbox 3.0 for those of us using Macs. I have sent my concerns to AbleSoft."
4,My 4th grade teaching wife loves it,"My wife asked me to help with the administration of her class so I aquired 3.0. Since she has little familiarity with software I studied it and trained her. Now she does a considerable amount of communication with parents using the system. Further, after getting over the learning curve, she is able to reduce much of the mundan repetitative work with TT. I like the simplicity of the system."
1,Is this company still in business?,"...[With] the advent of 'rSchool' we bought 5.0. ...[It] isn't compatible with Macs - they sell version 5.0 with version three for us pathetic Mac users. To say the least, we are disappointed...!I would love to address this with the folks at Able-soft, but their website is down, and their listed phone number is out of service.Frankly, if they HAVE gone out of business, I think they probably earned it. Including a two-versions old product inside a shiny new box is bad business. They should have marketed version five as being specifically for PC's..."
1,Please Do Not Waste Your Money,"This product has no help files, no tutorial, no user guide or any other kind of instruction. The company's website and apparently their phone numbers are all out of service. Don't waste your money."
5,Top notch monitor,"I took this monitor out of the box, connected it to the computer and it has worked flawlessly from the beginning. I use AutoCAD software daily and this monitor has a very clear picture so I don't have to zoom in and out constantly. I've got the screen set to the maximum resolution and the only problem I see is when I select an item, the oblect selected shimmers, but that's a minor issue."
1,Mediocre performer and way over-priced,Not only is this an average performer but it's way over-priced. Monitors from HP and Sceptre have better image quality as well as cost a lot less.
3,Not sure....,Whole foods product. Who knows for sure if this kind of vitamin does anything. Or any vitamin for that matter. I just like the fact in comes from food.
5,The only Vitamin C supplement we use!,"Finally, a truly natural Vitamin C supplement! I was relieved to find a safe alternative to ascorbic acid which uses genetically modified (conventional maize starch based) micro-organisms in it's production.As an added bonus, this stuff is very palatable. I actually enjoy it mixed in a glass of water and it goes undetected in my children's smoothies. It mixes easily, I just stir with the spoon I scooped it with.I've had no issues taking this in higher doses, unlike other C Supplements, it's never caused loose bowels or upset stomach.Thank you Healthforce for offering such a high quality product! We added this one to our 'Subscribe & Save' subscription."
4,As Expected,"It is okay for the standard 3x5 type flags you see everywhere. The red is pretty red though, and the definition in the Southern Cross is pretty good, but the flag won't last long in the wind. Worth the money to me though, since they are hard to find."
3,Bad cake recipe,"I have had this cookbook for a while. The main course recipes are pretty good, but today I made the chocolate raspberry truffle cake (pictured on the back of the book). The recipe flipped two of the major steps in the recipe. It said to pour the ganache over the cake (while still in the pan) before cutting the cake in three layers (which is difficult to do since it is so crumbly) and frosting it. You can tell that the steps should be flipped by looking at the picture, but I did not realize this until it was too late. :("
5,For girls from grades 4-6.,"Lauren, Kate, and Stephanie are sleepover friends. That means that they spend week-ends eating lots of snacks and watching movies. When shy Patti arrives at Riverhurst School, Stephanie wants her to join the group. Suddenly, everything starts to go wrong and Patti believes that she is cursed! Patti decides that she can't jeopardize her friends too! When will these disasters stop? If you like this book, you'll love the rest of the series ""Sleepover Friends"""
1,A boring piece of trash,"Please don't waste your money or some poor, innocent tree on this book. I do not advise buying any other books in this series, either. It is about four girls who think one of them has a curse on her, because bad stuff starts happening around her. A lame plot results in a boring book, so spare the trees."
2,disappointed,"I was very disappointed the second I got this book and cracked it open. I purchased it because I considerd myself a poor letter writer and wanted new fresh creative ideas. These sames and mostly very short, seemed shallow, unfinished, and are very simple and elementary. As for me. this was a waste of money. I am obviously much more creative than I thought and would never send a client a letter with 4-5 short sentences."
3,Practical real estate tool,"Good variety of time saving text - which can be used for newsletters and email campaigns. Very suitable to those who are either new or ""shy"" to write."
2,"POW, Viet Nam","Other books we have read on this subject were much better! The language used was straight out of the gutter. Would advice John Mccain, Robbie Risner books on this same subject. They are much better and very much better written."
3,"Good, but nothing new here","My problem with this cd is that Magus Caligula sounds like he is losing his voice. I wouldn't be surprised if they had a new singer on their next album. The music is still pretty good, if not rather stagnant, but then again this is Dark Funeral I'm talking about and by now you know if you like them or dislike them because they haven't done anything different since their inception in 1993. Get this cd if you are a fan, but if you're just getting into Dark Funeral, stick with some of the earlier stuff like their self titled debut, Secrets of the Black Arts (awesome cd), and Vobiscum..."
5,Hilarious,David Crowe is hilarious. This DVD made me LOL. I haven't done that in years with a stand up comedian. He is truly one of a kind. His humor is very timely and he doesn't pull any punches on anyone.
1,no show,"Just returned from holiday to find this dvd in the post,got it for my boyfriend for a surprise,he was delighted with my present until we went to play it. As in my title it was a no show,wont work on my dvd player so am not impressed and dont think i will be buying anything from amazon again."
2,Five Americans,"I remember hearing the Five Americans album when it came out in '67, and heard most of the songs live, as the band I was in at the time, the Mersey Sounds, opened for them in Baton Rouge, La., as they toured to promote it. They had a great sound, were a good live group, but unfortunately were among the one-hit-wonders (who actually had a few hits) who vanished from sight before the dawn of the 70's. But they had their 15 minutes of fame and added to the totality of the '60's sound admirably."
2,Haven't we seen this before?,"Disappointing coming of age drama about a gay teenager coming out to his family, friends and himself. (Hampus Björck) does a good job as the rebellious title character, effectively portraying the confusion and angst most teenagers experience as they make the transition from child to adult. The main problem with the movie is that Sebastian just isn't very likable. I'm not sure if his parents are supposed to be his enemies or simply buffoons. In any case I found them much more interesting and sympathetic than their son.There are lots of coming of age movies out there, maybe too many. The territory has been covered already, and this one doesn't have anything new to say. Too bad."
2,Better wear Your Bifocals,"Has great information, but print and graphics are extremely difficult to read."
2,slips off toilet.,Do not order this product if you aren't thin. I liked the design which matches my bathroom well; but despite tightening it again and again..this seat slips an inch or so off the toilet when I sit on it ..very uncomfortable. I weigh almost 200 lbs..so likely it would work better for a lighter weight person; but am not sure. Still..other seats work for me so I am replacing it by a better seat.
4,Super Book,The golden keys presented in this book are useful and practical with indepth information on optimal nutrition. Many references and handy resources are provided for supplemental information.
4,Thoughtful and worth the read,I have read other writings of Thich Nhat Hanh and was impressed with his thought process and writings in general. This book is a good one. He deeply compares two distinct views that differ in most peoples minds and does it well. He has also done it in an understandable and respectful way most people will enjoy.
3,Surprised,"I was a little apprehensive during the first few chapters on the whole idea of ""God"" and almost stopped reading but I trucked on. I kept reading with an open mind and in the end I found a new found respect for the Christian view of life. Thay brings together the many similarities between Christian and Buddhist view points that I never thought of. I personally grew tired of the comparison over time but the last few chapters focused more on a Buddhist/Universal teachings which really stuck with me."
4,All paths lead to God,"After reading ""Peace is every step"" I had to know more of Thich Nhat Hanh. My search led me to this book. (My pastor led me to Peace is every step). This is a great look at the parallels between Christianity and Buddhism. In the end it seems to show that we aren't that different."
2,Book was fair,I am a Christian and was told I might get some more insight into Christ from the Buddhist angle. It talked about Jesus and Buddha in the same sentences as though Buddha and Christ were the same. It totally neglected the resurrection as if it didn't even happen
1,Camel and peanuts,"Robert anton wilson once said you can say peanuts and camels are the same thing if you look at the contours of there backs and ignore eveythin g else. This book does that with christianity and buddhism, it is very naive and may be insulting to christians for it's lack of depth. Yes, dialog between buddhists and christians is desirable, but this book is too simplistic about the problem. If you want a good book about buddhism read""Being Peace"" another one of Thay's books. I can't recommened this one. A step back for christian-buddhist dialog.Sorry"
1,Intolerance to Christ's Truth,"Unfortunately, we live in such relativistic times where there is no objective truth, just ""what's truth for me may not be truth for you."" Therein lies the problem. When peoples of different faiths start mingling their beliefs, you get confusion.Buddha said, ""Do not worship me, for I am not a god."" Christ said, ""I am the Way, the Truth and the Life.""To mingle Buddha's man-made teachings with Christ's, the son of God, who said ""be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect,"" who very definitely through Tradition and in the bible left dogma to be followed in order to strive for holy perfection, is silly and politically correct drivel. And of course there will be those yelling ""intolerance!"" and ""offensive!"" but Christ was killed for offending people -- he claimed he was the son of GOD!I'll take God's word over Siddhartha Guatama's, also known as ""Buddha."""
1,THIS IS A JOKE RIGHT?,"Buddhism & Christianity have only one thing in common; MORALITY. Nothing else.The author needs to find other ways to make money. This book encourages ignorance, and delusion. I pity Thich Nhat Hanh.If you want to know what Christianity is read the Bible. If you want to truely understand Buddhism, visit www.buddhanet.net... there youll find FREE E-Texts detailing every aspect of Theravada & Zen Buddhism."
4,Essential reading.,"Wonderful book that reminds me greatly of Fritjoff Capra's ""Tao of Physics"" in which key words were replaced in identical sentences made by mystics on the one hand and quantum physicists on the other. Once words like ""atoms"" and ""spirit"" are removed, it is imposssible to see which camp has made the statement. As with ""Living Buddha.."", once the key words are removed from the Christian/ Buddhist statements, it is also hard to determine which devotee has spoken. The only book I have found to transcend both these 'religious' outlooks is the classic and inspiring ""The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years"" by Richard G. Patton. The Jesus of Patton's book is depicted BEFORE he was seconded by the early Church and walks the fine line that ""Living Buddha.."" alludes to. Excellent book, compassionately delivered."
2,difference matters too,"I read the rebuttle that michael notz wrote to an earlier review and can't believe that he can't see the flaws in his logic. There certainly is a differnce between saying buddhism and christianity have common ground and equating buddism with christianity and vice versa. This is what thich nhat han does in this book. Common ground is great, but real tolerance is tolerating differece and diversity, not pretending it doesn't exist. I can disagree with someone and still respect there point of view without embracing it. I respect thich nhat han, but that doesn't mean I have to like every thing he has to say. There is a world of difference between tolerating and respecting other points of view and pretending that they are the same. Every one can tolerate sameness, real tolerance is admiting difference and still showing respect. Even a buddha can't ride a peanut and shell a camel. I can't recommend this book very strongly, but this are a few good things about it."
4,Viewing Christ from a Buddhist perspective,"I found this book to contain simple but profound truths. It is an easy read. I am not knowlegable of Buddhist practice and found it interesting and fairly informative on that topic. His views of Jesus were often refreshing and new. On a negative note, the topic of mindfulness seemed to be the solution to all issues and problems. Who knows - maybe it is!"
4,Comfortable and Very Pretty,"I love Wacoal bras. They fit me well, they're comfortable, and they're very pretty. Good quality bras that aren't frightfully expensive."
5,Discontinued,"I LOVE THIS BRA!!!! It is the most comfortable bras I've ever worn. However, I can no longer find it in my size and I have no idea why. UGH!!!"
3,Walcoal Bra,Just OK. I have worn this brand of bra for a long time but was dissapointed in this one. Does not fit like the rest I own.
1,"Out of Print, but a goodie","This VHS combo is a steal! Too bad it hasn't been reproduced on DVD. I have not found another bridge video.Made in the '80's, it is still very instructional and well done.My wife and friends are beginners and we all agree with the above."
5,Bow down...,"The Music Machine was here briefly, and then they blew away. But they left behind two albums...and this is the one to get.Back story: The Music Machine were the malevolent demons of garage rock. They dressed all in black, dyed their hair black and each member wore one black leather glove. The gloved hand symbolized the group, while the naked hand represented the individual. This alone should make you want to buy it.But it goes beyond the image. The Music Machine was one of the loudest, roughest and strangest bands around. Sailing on the coat-tails of their only hit, ""Talk Talk"", they finagled this last album out, which is mainly comprised of material made as the band was dissolving.But witness songs like ""Bottom of the Soul"" and ""Eagle Never Hunts the Fly"" and get blown back by the blast of divine light which will hold you by your throat. This is simply a great CD and one that any afficianado of garage rock should own.Now."
4,"Funny, Poignant Compilation","I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Especially the short story by Robert Inman, which had me laughing my head off! I've lived my entire life in Charlotte and wasn't aware that we had so many talented folks here. Keep up the good work, Charlotteans!"
1,OMG! This really [stank].,"This is one if the worst books I have ever read, no kidding. The plot is boring, the characters are NOT the epitome of pleasant and likeable, the villains just cardboard uber nastiest, and so on. Oh, and the whole world, no universe, no creation, NO MAGIC IT SELF is threatened! (Gasp) If you are masochistic, this books for you!"
4,Suprising,A wonderful mystery short that is a continuation of the series. A great read that keeps the reader guessing with little hints spread throughout.
4,SURFIN BIRD LIVES,THIS IS A VERY GOOD CD. THE SOUND QUALITY IS VERY GOOD CONSIDERING THE AGE (EARLY 60'S). SOME GOOD COVERS OF OTHER ARTIST'S SONGS AND SOME GREAT ORIGINAL HITS. A GOOD REALLY GOOD BUY.
2,Out of date and poorly structured,"I'm a college math lecturer who uses MAPLE as part of teaching calculus. As an introduction to MAPLE I have to give the book a poor review. While the author clearly has extensive knowledge of MAPLE, the book is structured so it's virtually impossible to find anything except by accident. Many of the topics covered are highly specialized and of little relevance to the reader looking for a general introduction. Finally, the book covers MAPLE 8. MAPLE is now at version 12, and has gone through many package extensions and user interface changes since then. The current user will be mystified with the disconnect between what they are reading and what they see on the screen.Where else to go for an introduction? I'm not aware of a really good text out there, but the short instructional videos on MAPLE's web site give good brief overviews of new features, and the sample commands in the online help can help you get started."
4,excellent maple how-to book,"this book is not really an introduction. By page 9 he's finding stationary points of differential equations and covers techniques for using Lie Group Methods for solving PDEs and ODEs. it's well written and easy to follow given how relatively deep and broad the coverage is. it is not a quick ""how to"" kind of book. i would recommend the on-line manuals for that, which you can easily find on the web for whatever version of maple you use or own.The table of contents and index are extensive but it can still be difficult to find a nested topic.this book offers very comprehensive maple usage in all kinds of mathematical settings, whether it be matrices, systems of ODEs, individual ODEs and PDEs, calculus, vector analysis, algebra, etc.make sure you get the latest edition (2003?). it's twice as large (800+ page) and much more up to date. i found it for under $10. the book will help you do detailed work in the many special areas that maple covers."
3,Poor reception,"I got this phone to replace my RAZR when a very unfortunate accident killed it. I like the size and the styling, but the reception is horrible. My RAZR got great reception and my wife's RAZR gets 5 bars when I will only get one in certain places. I bought an antenna booster, but that hasn't helped. I wish I had paid more for a RAZR!"
3,"very well written stories about unpleasant, uninteresting characters","I have to give this collection of short stories a few stars because they are very well written. However, the subject matter is invariably depressing and the characters unpleasant and uninteresting. Take your choice of juvenile delinquents, dying old men, unemployed bums who think their wives should support them while they write great novels, louts who mistreat their wives or girl friends, etc, etc. You should be young when you read these. Once you're older life is too short to be made depressed, no matter how capably you are made depressed. The author's novels are better."
5,REALLY!!!!?,I'm shocked to see the price tag on this stuff........yeah it smells great and that's why i bought 4 big bottles of this when it came out. i still have 2 left. I just don't understand that price
3,Look nice....but wear out quickly.,the quality of everything on the sandal is great with the exception of the upper sole (the straw-like part where the bottom of your feet touch)....it is like straw or some weak fiber and wears down fast to the material beneath and looks dirty...this is after maybe 2 mos of wear a coupla days a week...and I'm not out hiking or anything....totally normal wear. They're not worth the msrp or anywhere close to it...I wouldn't pay more than 10 bucks for a new pair after having owned them.
2,There are better books for your $$,"This book was a disappointment. See A.Amatori's 21 March 2003 review - I concur with it completely. Wish I would have read that review before purchasing.On the plus side, it does provide an overview of many of the currently produced multihulls in case you want basic info.Far better books are Chris White's ""The Cruising Multihull"" and Charles Kanter's ""Cruising in Catamarans""."
3,The Cruising Multihill / Sailors' Multihull Guide,"I purchased these two books together and would not do so again as they cover pretty much the same ground.A major section of ""Sailor's Multihull Guide"" is taken up with description of a large number of new and expensive sailboats. For my needs this is pointless.I find ""The Cruising Multihull"" to be the more useful of the two books."
1,Seiko review,The product's short comings are the lack of having a dictionary and the spell check is not broad enough in it's search therefore it comes up short. I should not have purchased it. I have a preorder for Seiko dict/spell check/thesaurus model. Please find one! Thanks
4,ANOTHER GREAT SURF MUSIC CD,"TECHNICALLY SPEAKING, THIS IS A SURF AND ""HOT ROD"" MUSIC CD. THERE ARE A LOT OF SONGS RELATED TO CARS AND RACING HERE. MY FAVORITE IS ""SHE RIDES WITH ME"", SUNG BY PAUL PETERSEN (FROM THE DONNA REED SHOW), WITH THE BEACH BOYS PLAYING BACKUP (!). ANOTHER GOOD ONE IS ""LET'S GO WHERE THE ACTION IS"" BY TOMMY BOYCE (FROM THE SONGWRITING DUO BOYCE AND HART WHO WROTE A LOT OF THE HITS LATER ON FOR THE MONKEES). BUT THERE ARE SOME OTHER RARE GEMS HERE TOO THAT YOU WILL LIKE. COUPLE OF GREAT SONGS BY THE TORNADOES (YOU SHOULD GET THEIR GREATEST HITS CD AS WELL, IT ROCKS!), THE SHUTDOWNS, AND THE CUSTOMS (FEATURING EARLY SURFING MUSIC LEGEND GARY USHER."
4,Great tasting option for kids,"If your child is struggling with recurring UTI's and you have been hunting for a cranberry supplement that a young child or toddler will enjoy then be sure to give these a try. They are really pleasant tasting and the heart shape makes them much more fun for our dd than a plain wafer or tablet. Silly? Yes, but every little bit helps, especially when you are trying to get a kid to willingly take one every single day. We tried another brand before these and they were ok but not great. So when those ran out we decided to look around for alternatives. These are also a bit sweeter and less chalky than our previous selection, so probably more palatable to any child. So glad we found them."
5,Perfect for Urinary Tract Infection,"Take two tablets a day when you think you may have urinary tract infection, or feeling the sensation of having the infection. It's in heart shape, it's chewable, and it tastes like tart candy. it's all natural so nothing that will harm you."
5,Great introduction to Abstract Algebra,Unfortunately our professor used a different and really bad book when I was first introduced to the subject. I read Herstein's book shortly after on my own and everything became crystal clear. Provides a sound foundation for further study in algebra and number theory.
2,Annoying sticker attached.,"The price was great and the condition was as advertised, but I must warn you that this product came with an extremely annoying sticker attached. These stickers often appear on used textbooks glued on with what seems like an industrial-grade adhesive. They are incredibly tedious to remove, and doing so will invariably damage the book's cover. Moreover, no mention was made of the sticker in the product description. If you can get this textbook (or others offered by the seller) for slightly more money elsewhere, I would advise you to do so in order to avoid the inconvenience of removing a terrible, horrible sticker."
5,Great Series.,"Downton Abbey has wonderful story lines, beautiful sets, and it provides a unique insight of teh way British nobility lived in the early 1900s."
5,Its the best!!!,"I was not able to watch Downton Abbey when it first came out or during the second season. I downloaded the first episode on season one and was in love within the first 15 minutes at least. I decided to buy this edition which includes the Christmas episode on season 2. In one weekend, I watched this whole thing and then was in withdrawal until Jan 2013 to find out what happened. This dvd collection has so many extra special features on it too."
5,Fantastic Series,"I bought this for a Christmas gift. She loves the series, as well as I do and was thrilled to receive it. Cannot wait for series 3. Love the idea it was the original UK version"
5,Amazing,"Yep, Worth having it. Great show. My wife suggested and I was at first weary, but I cannot believe how much I loved the show."
5,What an excellent show,It's the type of show you can never get enough of. I find myself ranting about how people treat each other and then realize they are not real people after all.
5,Downton rocks!,I LOVE this show and having the entire first two seasons in one set is wonderful. I had the added benefit of visiting the English estate (Highclere Castle) where it's filmed earlier this year. I'm a huge fan!
2,Pointless wase of time and $$,"Other than the performance of Maggie Smith, who is brilliant even when sitting perfectly still and saying nothing, this series is a colossal waste of time. Trivial storylines involving petty, uninteresting characters, all of whom should have been killed off in the second-season war."
5,Downton Abbey Seasons 1 & 2 Limited Edition Set Original UK Set (Blu-ray),This Masterpiece Classic is engaging and addicting if you love the United Kingdom and some of it's wonderful actors. Follows the lives of servants that serve Downton Abbey and obviously those that are priviledged enough to live or visit Downton Abbey. Lots of sidelines to this saga that mainly involve Lord Downton's three daughters. Can't wait for season 3 to come out on Blu-ray in January to see how the story continues.
5,"Captivating, entertwined stories and beautiful cinematography","Before purchasing this ""Original UK version"", I read reviews unhappy with the ""PBS"" versionbecause of over-editing. This UK version indeed seems to flow very smoothly, telling the story in full.It's like a historical novel set in real places with real historical events unfolding around the charactersso I especially enjoy learning history indirectly by watching life in 1912-1920 in England."
4,Excellent Show!,"I got seasons 1 & 2 on DVD on the basis that literally everyone I know loves Downton. I hadn't seen any of it yet. Started watching the first two episodes after work one night, and spent my entire day off watching as much as I could - so now I'm almost done already. COULDN'T STOP. Anyway this DVD set is alright, it looks nice and works well. However it seems that the first season is not HD while the second is. Also, not sure if this was due to the sound mixer on the original show or how the DVD version was set up, but the music gets really loud when there is no dialogue, haha. But I can't wait to see the rest : )"
3,"Great series, quality not the best",On both disks there were frozen spots that I had to fast forward through . That said the series is wonderful
1,Terrible Quality,"I was so excited to get this DVD set but was so quickly disappointed. The quality was terrible. It was all grainy and the sound cut in and out. DVD looked like it was boot-legged or something. Thank goodness for Amazon's quick return andrecredit policy. I don't feel so duped now. Also, I had pre-ordered the Season 3 which was supposed to ship in Feb. Decided to cancel that as well. Too bad."
4,Downtown Abbey Season 1 and 2 Limited Edition- original UK version,"I had a difficult time understanding it at first but once I got the language, I enjoyed the DVDs. The packaging is great and this makes a great gift."
5,Excellent!,Received promptly ... No problems. Our new favorite show! The characters are complex and (most) are very like-able! The cinematography is amazing ... Scenery and costumes like you've never seen before. Don't miss this series! Can't wait for season 3 which starts in January.
4,A great gift for the Anglophile on your list.,"This series is bound to be a classic for every history/drama/dry comedy fan on your gift list! Or, Keep it for yourself!"
1,Product sold as new but previously viewed and wouldn't load,This product was supposed to be new but it had been previously viewed and Disc One wouldn't load. Had to return it and there wasn't an option to receive a replacement.
5,An excellent tale,"Excellent story and believeable characters. Good morals, no need to try to filter out parts. These are the kinds of stories that are uplifting. Thanks."
4,Good program,I'm glad I bought the first two seasons of which I have watched one. If not seeing the first one I would be lost on all the characters of whom there are a lot to follow.It's a very interesting program.
4,Like being in a different era,"My wife and I have ran out of TV series to follow during our spare time (or what you may probably consider ""prime time""). Once we watched, my wife and I can't stop looking for what happens in the next episode. It's also been great to at least mimic British accent.Looking forward to Season 3 on TV! Though I hate that the season is over in the UK whereas it only started in the US. We are prone to spoiler alerts and temptation to browse through Wikipedia."
5,Great series.,There are about 8 episodes each season. Excellent. On the last disk of season two make sure you watch Christmas at Downton. It's really another and the best episode.
5,A fan,"Didn't know what all the fuss was all about but decided to buy it for the long Thanksgiving weekend (don't watch football). Excellent period drama, beautifully crafted and great to watch. Couldn't get enough and can't wait for season 3 (and 4 and 5...)."
1,horrible! do not buy!,This was purchased as a Christmas gift for a family member and I was upset to see them watching it. The quality of the blu ray dvds are absolute garbage. The picture is horribly grainy and the playback is jumpy. It is very noticeable. We turned to the hd episodes playing on tv and they are crystal clear and perfect. I don't see how a boy ray disc set could be so bad. I own several other blu rays and have never seen ones look like this. I honestly think it's a bootleg ...will be contacting amazon for further investigation
5,"Fast, friendly and one piece.",This came next day and was great. The show is wonderful nd I will continue to buy both electronic and hard copy from here.
5,"great series, great quality",giddy with excitement as I watch each episode. The quality is great and there is so much stuff to watch. The extras are great too.
5,Great Buy!,"I had been wanting to purchase this and when I saw it as a ""Deal Of The Day"", I snapped it up! Even my husband has been watching it. Very good!"
5,Great show,"This is the show that has grabbed so many viewers. It is not fast-paced or intensely paced, but it is an emotional story of a family that pulls you in and holds you. The feel of the show is very Jane Austenesque, with a little edge to it. The first season has some scandal and intrigue, while the second season really develops the characters, causing you to feel each ones' individual story and somehow cheer each one on. A fantastic show."
5,Season 1 and 2 of Downton Abbey,"Hoorah! Both seasons together! If you are not yet a Downton Abbey fan you soon will be after you watch an episode or two. If you like this time period in history you will like this show! I was thrilled to find the Christmas special at the end of Season 2 and it really is the ending of Season 2 not just a Christmas special. Also, the extras are a nice bonus. The acting and costumes are excellent and it is a story well told !"
3,Downton Abbey,"The show was great and for the most part so were the dvds/ Until the very last disc of season 2. It ""froze up"".. Sometimes would just kick in and continue. And sometimes I had to fast forward and miss a few scenes, So it wasn't ""perfect."""
5,Downton Abbey,I'm totally hooked on this mini-series! The DVD set was such a bargain with 15 hours of segments to enjoy.
5,Highly recommend,This is well worth the money so spend it and enjoy! Love it and it looks great on Blu ray!
3,Could be labeled better,This rating of 3 stars is referring to how the discs are labeled. It is impossible to tell which episodes are on which discs.
5,Another Time and Era...Riveting,"Propelled into the world of a wealthy entitled family of the early twentieth century living in England...youFind yourself relating to not only their romances and inter-family rivalry but also to the incredibly interestingLives of their house maids and servants. World War 1 only increases the interest as you see first handThe impact war had on the lives of this family! Very well done , believable, and enjoyable."
5,I Love Downton Abbey!,This was a Christmas gift. Unfortunately I accidentally bought blu-ray & they couldn't view it on their DVD playerNow It can't be returned cause it's been opened : (
4,Great production,"Quality of image and production is superb. Characters are interesting and story is gripping... I have just started to watch the show, and can't wait for more..."
5,I love this series !,This is a great story line. I really enjoy this show and have suggested to my family and friends to watch it .
5,Downton Abbey 1&2 series,"Loved the Downton Abbey series, love the DVD set. I've watched it approx 10 times already. Bought another set for my daughter's Christmas gift. I highly recommend this series for anyone who likes Masterpiece. Makes a great gift."
2,This version is a mistake.,"Probably would be great, but the UK version I bought on Amazon does not play on US disc players...It is constantly pausing, so it is impossible to watch. I even bought a new DVD player, thinking something was wrong with mine...and it did same. So, watch what you buy!"
1,poor quality,3 of the disks didn't work. They froze up. skipped. Poorly made product. I gave this as a gift so it was really a disappointment.
4,Baby boomers,"Baby boomers will love this... It's regal with a twist of mystery... It's not for everyone but if you're reading this, you'll like it."
1,Don't buy as an early Christmas gift...,Purchased on special sale prior to Christmas as gift. Gave on New Year's Day. Daughter found a disc cracked when began to watch late January. Too late to replace. A real bummer!!!
2,Love Downton,"Downton Abbey is an excellent dramatic series. The product itself, however, was defective. One of the Season 1 discs skips over a significant part of the recording."
5,Downton Abbey 1 and 2,Heard a lot about this series so I decided to order the DVDs. I was totally hooked and watched them back to back over a week! Cannot wait for the new season to begin this weekend.
5,outstanding series,cant wait for season 3. this series is brillently acted. reminds me of upstairs downstairs. downton abbey rules. the britsh know how to make a great series.
5,If you want enjoyment this is the show to watch,"This may be one of the best shows I've ever watched or very close to it I am looking forward to season three, which starts on the 6th. If you want many hours of enjoyment and a look at English royalty this purchase will be well worth it. In a word Great!"
5,Excellent drama.,"I love this series and cannot wait to see the next season. My all-time favorite series hands down. Quality programming without resorting to gratuitous sex and foul language, although there IS sex and murder and intrigue. Just love the attention to the detail in the settings of that time period."
4,Product handling is outstanding,Absolutely satisfied with All my purchases and returns with Amazon and their affiliates...DvD was advertised as like new and arrived in retail packaging...cant find this set anywhere else so it was truly a great deal for a birthday gift
5,u.k. just as good,It is one of my favorite shows and the u.k. version looks about the same for a lot less price
5,Simply splendid,"Masterful storytelling, videography, costuming and character development. A classic for all time, as we have come to expect from Masterpiece works."
3,missing disc 2 seasin 1,Series is great but i did not receive disc 2 of the first season -just 1 and three . It would be a hassle to send it back
1,MISSING SEASON 2 EPISODES 5 AND 6,"I am SO disappointed that this ""complete"" set is missing two key episodes from season 2: episodes 5 and 6. I couldn't believe it when the storyline jumped forward so abruptly. I went on pbs' website to determine which episodes are missing. I ordered season 3 on amazon when it became available; I can only hope it is complete."
4,"Wasn't a huge fan, but now I'm hooked.","Great acting, great packaging. Maggie Smith is always terrific, Michelle Dockery is understatedly hot. Having Seasons 1 & 2 in the same box brings good continuity.Oh, a Bill Maher joke: ""Stop telling me to watch Downton Abbey!"" Heh."
4,A good upper-class soap.,"This is a great series if you want to follow very different characters along the paths that they (or fate) choose. The upstairs, downstairs effect has been a hit before and is again, and you are equally drawn to both, but perhaps slightly more to the downstairs, where people can show their emotions more. You come to love the locale, with its magnificent cedars of Lebanon gracing the property, and the house, as they say, is a character in itself. This is a great showpiece for some good acting from both tried and true personages of stage and film as well as newer, younger break-outs. It will be interesting to see where they turn up next."
4,Downton Abbey,"Excellent series. Awesome acting, whether one likes the characters or not. Screen resolution not good on early episodes.Other than that a very enjoyable series."
5,perfect gift for the fan,Gave to wife as a christmas gift. She loves it and it saved me from having to gift an ungodly amount to my PBS station.
5,Quality show worth watching,This is a wonderful series and great on a cold winter day to view since you have to stay in due to the cold.
5,Fantastic,My wife loved it. The story line and scenes show English aristrocracy as they were then and very little has changed.
5,THIS DVD SET HAS BROUGHT MEUP TO DATE ON WHAT HAPPENS LATER,SINCE I DID NOT GET STARTED IN THE TV SERIES AT THE BEGINNING THIS SET HAS BROUGHT ME UP TO DATE AND HELPS ME UNDESTAND WHAT IS GOIING ON.
5,Great Show,You better carve out some time for this purchase. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my parents and now we're all addicted. Great and entertaining series.
2,The series is great mines just came broken,"I got this as a present for a friend and all the cds with the episodes are fully functional except the cd with the special features came cracked i would return it but since i gave it as a present i cant really ask for it back just to return it for a new one. Aside from the unusable special features cd, this is a really great product."
2,Season 1,"We just watched season 1 and there were only 2 episodes?? What are we missing? We loved what we saw, but there has to be more episodes per season! Please respond if anyone has thoughts on this.Thank you - Gina Burkhart"
3,Great Cinematography / The Plot tries too hard,"The production work is amazing and the acting is high quality. The plot line is like watching a seismograph as an earth quake is starting which starts tame and by the end is a bunch of crazy scribbles . Don't get me wrong, I like an intricate plot, but the longer this series goes the less I believe the viability of it."
1,Gift,"This was a gift. I was pleased that it arrived on time, but I did not opend package and did not play the DVD."
1,Not worth it,"I had to give it one star for the scenery for that period of time. As for the dialogue, I didn't understand it They don't talk good. Who learned them? I didn't see any sub-titles. If you like soap operas this one is for you. Read somewhere there was 15 hours of this joke on the DVD. Not so. I was more than disappointed for the 6 hours I viewed."
5,Love this!!!,I loved this series so much I had to include it in my collection of movies. I would highly recommend it.
5,Excellent,Loved it! Can't wait for the next season to start! If you've missed any of it this is a great way to catch up!
5,Wonderful,I really love this series so I was glad to purchase this set so I can watch it over and over. I am loving the third season and will buy that at some future time.
5,Escape to Downton,"Received this dvd set as a gift because I had missed it on tv. Immediately I was absorbed into the world of Downton, the culture, the traditions, the family. It is set in a different world and time but intertwines the stories of the rich with the world of the servants. All storylines are interesting and relevant and the twists and turns make it very interesting."
5,Fabulous Series!,This is an excellent series that is absolutely engrossing. We watched both seasons in less than 10 days. Can't wait for the next season to begin.This was an excellent price for this item - good value.
5,Awesome ...,I give this 5 stars cause the story of Downton Abbey is great. But also the packaging to receive season 1 and 2 together is great. I read some complaints about the last episode and the Christmas special missing from season 2 on this collection. That is not the case because it can be found in the last DVD of season 2 which if you look at the labeling seems to be a DVD of extras. I highly recommend this series.
5,So good!,The perfect costume series. The cast is perfect. I can't wait for series three. The extras are fun to watch
5,Thanks UK,Missed the first season & wanted to catch up. This made all of the pieces come together & I'm ready for the new season. Love this show!!
4,Love this show!,"I love this show, and now I get to watch it whenever I want!! Cant wait to jump back into Downton!!"
3,"Show is great, DVDs are eh","I love the series. Characters, plot, sets, acting and filming is great. This is really a review of the DVDs. The extras are okay but limited: a ""making of"" short, a short about the real house, another about costumes. There are no commentary tracks. There are no introductions a la Masterpiece Theater: they are completely non-existent for season 1, and for season 2 you get Laura Linney saying who she is and that funding is made possible by viewers like you. That's it for the introduction. The subtitles are often inadequate -- they may pop up for only half a second or when something else is being said. There are no subtitles at all on the extras. Given that my local PBS does full-season marathons and that I have a DVR, I'm not sure that the DVD set was worth my money."
5,"Purchased as gift, recipients completely satisfied.","We had not watched the shows during the seasons, but the recipients had watched some and wanted this so they could catch up and review the show before the new season. This gift was perfect, and Amazon's price was unbeatable."
5,great show.,great show. dvd is put together well. this is nice to see coming from public television. keep it up PBS.
5,This is a must have.,I actually sat down and had a marathon watchibg this series as I wanted to get to the third season..What a fabulous fabulous show....so addictive you cannot wait to see what happens next.
5,Love it,"Love it, great show! Will definitely buy the next season when it comes out. Really looking forward to it. Awesome."
5,Loved every minute of it!,"This set, first of all was a GREAT price! The quality of the show was excellent as were some of the documentary style snippets included. Love the show--so happy I was able to get it!"
5,Downton Abbey seasons 1&2,"Great acting , spectacular scenery and wonderfully authentic period costumes. You really felt for the characters, although there are so many, it took a little while to get to know them. Couldn't stop watching."
5,Exciting and well acted.,"This period series is like a great book. Once you start it you will want to keep viewing. The characters are well defined and the look we get into their lives is uncanny. I can't decide which character I enjoy most, but the widow dowager comes close."
4,Brilliant!,The characters in this fabulous series are perfect fits. Everything about this Masterpiece theater production is great. Can not wait to see Season 3...
5,Definitive video transfer of this excellent series.,"All in one place...full unedited versions of seasons one and two...all the ""extras"" and a jaw dropping video and audio transfer of the series in blu-ray. Without question, the definitive version of the first two seasons of one of the most addicting and engaging television series ever....the highest recommendation possible!"
5,Nice Limited Edition DVD Set,"If you like Downton Abbey, and you don't already have the first release seasons 1 & 2 DVD sets of the series, then you should have this. I waited for this set instead of getting the first releases, but really it's more of a repackaging of the original release with the Christmas episode here as well. So buy this if you love Downton and don't already own it...and hurry because the 3rd season comes out in January!"
1,THIS IS STILL THE EDITED VERSION,"I bought this thinking it would be the original uk version without half of the scenes being cut out. I feel angry about the false advertising. It is cut and is not the original uk version. If you want the uncut version I don't know where to get it. I want my money back, as this was not what it says it is on the packaging.DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT THE WHOLE EPISODE!"
5,Downton Abbey Seasons 1 & 2,"I got to make my 84 year old mom very happy with 2 seasons of Downton Abbey. Great quality programming for a discerning viewer who loved going back in time in England. The behind the scenes features were especially enjoyable to learn more about the property , the costuming, characters, etc."
5,Excellent series,My wife wanted to see the first two seasons before the third season started. We both watched while I was sick and loved it. Fascinating character studies of the aristocracy and the servant class.Now its hard to wait a week between episodes!
4,Love Downtown Abbey but,"I played all the DVD's all the through and everything was great but I tried to watch it a 2nd time and the DVD's skipped some went over more than one scene.To be fair, I haven't contacted anyone yet about this because I've been traveling. The package actually shipped faster than expected.Would have rated a 5 star had they not started skipping."
5,Downton Abbey,This is a marvelous series - even my husband is enjoying it with me. The characters are so real and show what the aristocracy and its help really were and probably still are. I have really enjoyed this.
5,Have become big fans,I bought this first and second season of Downton Abbey thinking I would watch while my husband was at work but we started watching together and we are both now big fans.
5,The BEST ever!,"Love it! Ggreat British soap opera! Can't get enough! If you love the British and love dramathis is for you. So many people, so many story lines. It will keep you wanting for more!"
5,excellant,makes me want to see more. can hardly wait to buy season 3 and 4. Extremely intriguing and excellent cast of characters.
5,Downton Abbey Ltd Edition,"This show is absolutely addictive! It is, without a doubt, the very best drama I have watched on TV in decades... it is worth every penny and every moment of your time. Maggie Smith is brilliant beyond words... could not watch them back-to-back as the characters are so richly drawn, I needed a little recovery time. I stretched out the enjoyment and watched them over a period of a few weeks!INCREDIBLE!!!!"
5,Downton abbey,"Great acting, great story , a pleasure. Received DVDs when promised . Ordered season 3 from here too. Can't wait to be able to get season 4"
5,Pinto Classics Pinto Sport Horse,This model is educational in a way because it teachs you about sport horses looks it is a flashly model I got this last year ago and loved it right away. It is fun because it is pretty and you can make up your own horse shows with other models and it will probaly win 1 place in the show. It not very stroung because Breyer makes their models for collection then toys but still you can play with them if you want but be very very very careful not to chip scrap or bend it because it won't be as beautiful it used to be.
2,Underaverage book in this field,"This is an old book. I have it for 15 years.This book is second edition of the book Algorithms + Data Structures = Programming, without Compiler construction, so the formula for it can be(Algorithm + Data Structures = Programming) - Compiler Construction = Algorithms & Data Structures.I bought it because of its famous author, N. Wirth, the creator of Pascal, Modula and Oberon progarmming languages.But the book was a dissapointment for me. The matter in the book is presented in very strange order. There are no field in the book that is explained complete. For example, there are many sorting algorithms in the book, internal as well as external, but some basic sorting algorithms and techniques are not explained. Quicksort algorithm is explained without explaining underlying devide-and-conquer method, etc.If you considering to by some book from the field of compute algorithms and data structures, there are many better books to buy than this one."
3,The Meanderings and Musings of a Contrary Man,"There is something depressingly familiar in the resigned assent to violence that Rimbuad closes his book with when he refers to the attempted assassination of Margaret Thatcher by the IRA. As the catalyst for a generation of young punk rockers to begin challenging the System, Rimbuad lead the band Crass on a raucous assault on the British establishment and it's icons. The banners then were anarchy, freedom and peace... Today, if I read Rimbuad correctly, they could well be that tried and failed cliche the worker's revolution and the attendant socialist fantasies that go along with it. This book is only truly coherent to those that followed Crass and absorbed the band's Rimbuad penned lyrics; Shibboleth is that personal. Still if you want an insight into one of the premier leaders and motivators of the British punk scene, and a major thorn in the side of the Thatcher era State read this book."
4,Good basis for a striking table setting,"I have off-white square dishes and they look very attractive on these black placemats. I just laundered them for the first time yesterday; having had some made of a similar fabric, I hung them by skirt hangers rather than toss them in the dryer - they look OK now but I'd want to iron them before using them for company. Oh, and be sure to peel off the paper labels before laundering; pieces of them will be all over the other darks in the load if you don't. All in all, I'm glad I got them, and with the caveats above, recommend them. Now to find the appropriate napkins...."
2,Great if you don't wash them,"When I first got these I loved them. The color was perfect and they were a good stiffness. They looked nice. I bought 8 of them so I had some to use while I was laundering them. All of them rolled terribly the first time I washed them. I hate to iron so I don't know if they iron well. I would not recommend these at all, what's the point if you can't clean them."
3,Color Disappointing,"I ordered these placemats in the natural color. It turned out to be more like a yellow, which I didn't like, but the recipients kept them anyway."
2,color not as pictured,"The color was described and pictured as lemon yellow. When I got them, they were more of a goldenrod color. Did NOT match the rest of my table linens which are actually lemon color. If they had matched, then I would have kept them because they seem to be good quality."
4,Pushing the Envelope and Sounding Good Doing It,"Dwight's third album is a standout. Although he has a couple of other albums that contain, overall, better songs, this particular album seems to push the envelope a little. There seems to be a Merle Haggard influence in many of these songs, and there is an obvious Buck Owens flavor to the entire album. ""She Wore Red Dresses"" is probably one of the most daring country songs recorded in the 80's. How many other artists sang about killing a cheating wife during that decade? It's dark sound and vengeful lyrics make it the star of this playlist. ""I Sang Dixie"" is a personal favorite. ""I Got You"" and ""Streets of Bakersfield"" have a man-against-the-system feel to them. Other good songs on this album include ""Send Me The Pillow"" and ""Hold On to God."" Overall, a good album with four great songs. As always, Pete Anderson's talent almost overshadows the star-power of Dwight. A perfect beginner's album to introduce you to Dwight Yoakam."
4,Outstanding Modern Instrumentals,"I love this music. I find the strings and the Stick very interesting and compatible. My wife was very close to Novi's sister, Elyse, the artist who did the pottery on the cover of the album, so I am probably biased, but I don't think you can go wrong buying this album."
5,its a radiator cap,"not much to say here, its a radiator cap and looks identical to the one i replaced with it. ACDelco on a GM is always a safe bet."
2,disappointing stereotypes,"Are there really still mothers who insist their daughters wear pink and force them to do ballet? I bought this thinking it might celebrate girls who enjoy doing both team sports AND dance (like so many girls I know DO), but this presents it as an either/or choice. It's great to encourage girls to do the team sports, but is it really necessary to tear down the other pursuit? My 6 year-old daughter was very disappointed. Baseball Ballerina Strikes Out is a better choice, though it doesn't really deal with dance, but the conflict is about handling teasing. We won't be re-reading it."
3,Baseball ballerina,"I bought this book for my 5-year-old niece because this is her first season of T-ball. She had also taken dance lessons the year before, so I thought it would cute to read about 2 activities that she was familiar with. I only gave this book 3 stars because I didn't like the way the 2 girls were forced to keep playing baseball a secret from their other friends. There are at least 4 girls on her T-ball team, so obviously lots of young girls play baseball. I don't see any reason why girls can't do both things, and I don't like the message that sends."
4,A fun book for girls who like it all!,"My daughter loves her dance classes, but she also likes to play rough and tough with her four brothers! Baseball Ballerina is a fun story that shows a girl it's okay to enjoy it all! An easy read for bedtime or anytime. We are looking forward to Baseball Ballerina Strikes Out!"
1,Volcano!,This was not the correct video that the title box represented. It makes me hesitant to purchase any other videos.
1,Don't waste your time on this expensive tin can,"The blades on this saw aren't really blades... they're more like a jagged tin can, which is great for cutting your hand on, but miserable when it comes to cutting drywall. The dust shield is a joke (a plastic drip tray you can probably buy at your local hardware store for $.25 with a hole in the middle). When I was cutting larger holes the tray vibrates all of the dust out. Also, the cutting wheels are so dull that it fried my Bosch Drill, which has been through quite a bit. I never thought I'd lose it to a piece of 5/8"" drywall. I would recommend the holepro. It costs about 4 times as much, but four of these saws won't get you much more out of them than the $.25 refund you can get for recycling it as scrap metal."
2,Speaker hole saw,I used this on the largest setting and was not impressed. It pretty unwieldy and tends to fling plaster and dust all about the room. It just wasn't what I was expecting.
3,Workable,"Using a high speed drill, slowly cutting into the ceiling while holding a shop vac nearby. I messed up and pressed the first hole, take your time and let the fast spinning blades slowly scratch their way into the sheetrock. I now use a drywall hand saw to finish the holes up. It's a ton cheaper than the other brand and it shows. I only plan on doing a few speaker holes in sheetrock so this saved me money. It's not perfect but does give you a heck of a head start on the holes.Bottom line - If you going to be doing a lot of work than spend the money on something better built. If you only doing a couple and your cheap like me, then you can make this work for you."
3,Just OK,"With this gig bag, you pretty much get what you pay for. I would say this is the bare minimum protection you'd want for your instrument to throw in the back of the car to take to a jam. I would not risk a high dollar instrument in this bag. Just barely fits my Dean EABFL, the bass is almost too tall and is a pretty tight fit."
5,Geat bag for a great price,I had been looking for a long time for an affordable bass gig bag. Fits my son's acoustic bass just right. Can't beat the price. It made a perfect Christmas gift.
4,Fine band; worth the investment,"I enjoy EBTG very much but as the years have passed I have decreasing patience with the maudlin, treacly side of their music, which is often not far from the surface here. This album has some finely crafted pop and will give years of listening pleasure. Amplified Heart, in my opinion, remains the best and most mature EBTG album; go for that one if you don't have any of their stuff."
4,I carry it along with me everywhere,"I have fun using Seiko's Word Power Personal Tutor. I like to articulate what I'm thinking, saying or writing; So I'm constantly using the spell checker and dictionary. The Q&A gets the brain moving - words that you wouldn't think about you have to figure how they relate to one of the mutliple choices. I like it and recommend it."
2,Not very bright Dictionary,"I received this dictionary as a gift. I am a reader and look up words I don't know. The idea was that I could carry this one around and look up the word at the very time I discovered one I didn't know.Unfortunately, I believe too much brain space of the dictionary is taken up with games and such...which I don't use. NONE of the words I have looked up since Christmas are included. I have come to believe that if I need to look up the word, it isn't there.A true disappointment.Examples: defenstration, quintile, arisaid, circadian, neoprene.I suggest A READER'S DICTIONARY with all the obscure words and none of the games. After all, a reader's entertainment is READING, not games.Thank you!"
4,My book log entry,"Since no one has a review of this book, I can add the little I recorded in my log of books I've read. I don't actually remember the book itself, but I wrote ""Children of two enemy China traders fight to release father. Opium lair."" My codes indicated the romantic protagonists had a good relationship, but not entirely conflict free, and there was some sex but nothing beyond plain intercourse."
4,volcano stove,"Very nice, once I figured out how to open (extend) it. I cooked a meal for six the day after I received it."
3,Expensive,The price went up 10 dollars from when I put it in my wish list. It was expensive to begin with and is not much more than a glorified grill. I am not interested in paying 100 dollars for some small grill to put fire in. I can dig a hole with an ETool and pile rocks around it and cook that way instead for nothing.
5,I've used this with all my younger students,"This is a great Disney Collection of classic Disney songs. It stops at Little Mermaid, so keep that in mind. But all the pieces are great Disney songs from past films. I've actually gone through a couple of them I have used them so much.Voice Lessons To Go's -Vocalize!- I always warm up with that first though!"
4,lessons for pondering and acting,"Sadly, the same mistakes are occurring without serious regard for long-term consequences to the environment. More examples would have helped. As a person who attended suburban Chicago public schools during the 1950s, memories of fiascos resulting from lack of planning resulted in classroom overcrowding and one year of half-day attendance. A lesson not learned is the idea of less is more for everyone."
4,Ok but Bewidering Edition of Dear America,I think my students will like this book and find it interesting but I am bewildered at the willingness of the author in adding gruesome episodes with little explanation. I find short passages that mention a gruesome death or injury and just go on to the next page. My main interest in using this book is for ESOL students whose reading levels are low but need American history lessons. This book fits the bill in history and reading level but I wonder if the book could have been written with a more comfortable fit. Students are going to end up with many more questions than a feeling of clarity. I will have to try to make that up.
4,Home here we come!!,I thought Westward to Home was an okay book. It was about a boy named Joshua and his family moving to Oregon. At the beginning of the book Joshua's grandfather didnt want to go to Oregon with his family. He thought it would be hard for him to leave his wife's grave. He eventually decided to go to Oregon with his family. Joshua was excited. Joshua's grandfather surprises his whole family with something he does on the trail. This book is best for boys. They can connect with how he feels and what he goes through.
5,Blistex Lip Tone,The product arrived in a timely fashion and was packaged well. It was exactly what I wanted and could not find at any local store. Now I have enough to last me for a long time.
5,"""The Continuation""","My beloved wife of fifty four years passed three years and nine months ago and the word ""devastation"" would hardly describe my feelings of loss. I have just finished reading Ms. Lintermans book and for the first time since the sudden and unexpected death of my wife I have, through her words, come to grip with many of the feelings of guilt that have been stifling my emotions. In brief I am now on a path of ""Continuation"" of what is left of my life...Thank you Ms. Lintermans!"
3,Funny as usual,I only wish Sam was alive today. What a routine he would have had with what is going on in the world. He makes me laugh even if what he says is not that funny. It was good to listen to this CD that I had never heard before.
4,OH-OHHHH!,"The only reason I didn't give this five stars was because nothing can touch Sam's first album, the hysterical ""Louder Than Hell"" (yes, it is out of print, but if your local record shop still sells cassettes you might get lucky). Sam Kinison was a true comic genius who would do material on stuff no comic would even dream of and make people laugh even when they were absolutely horrified at what he said. The phrase ""Nothing's sacred"" seems to have been invented for Sam Kinison. He was still in his prime when this album was recorded, and you will be convulsed beginning to end. Warning: Do NOT listen to this or any Sam Kinison recording while driving. I know of five people who have narrowly avoided or gotten into accidents because they were laughing so hard. Yes, I was one of them . . . . Rest in peace, Sam--you're still the best!"
5,Sam stands alone,"Nobody speaks to a man's soul like brother Sam. The man understood every possible way a man can be alienated, examined each way, and promptly made fun of it. He is what he is; love him or hate him, there's no in between; he stands alone, sui generis."
5,Solid transaction.,I was completely satisied with this tranaction. The product I recieved was as advertised. I arrived in a timely manner.
2,pales compared to Louder Than Hell,"I might consider this material better, had I not compared it to the far-superior Louder Than Hell. Every bit seems a half-baked rehash of Louder Than Hell, but with less heart, including the Jesus bit, the gay stuff, etc. The relationship stuff here feels extra-nasty, if that's possible. Not that Louder Than Hell was a rosy walk in the park, but it was much more fresh and original the first time around. Plus, Louder Than Hell had some awesome non-sex bits, like Manson/Beatles and World Hunger. Let's keep hoping that album finally gets released on cd."
5,excellent info for all,"I am a survivor and a professional and found this video an excellent and expertly done video. It offers information for those new to learning about sexual abuse, just discoverying their own healing journey, or for those who want to support other in the recovery process. The information is presented in a clear and foward manner and covers a range of topic areas. Eliana Gil is warm and educational. She provides a definition of what sexual abuse is, gives understanding to self-destructive behaviors and offers guidelines to address issues such as regaining trust, dealing with impacts and seeking support. Very encouraging! One of the most worthwhile videos I've viewed in promoting the well-being of survivors of sexual abuse. This video serves well for anyone who wants to better understand the concerns of people who have experienced sexual abuse, whether for self, family member, or helping professional. Thanks to Ms. Gil who shows us all that healing IS possible."
4,An incredible book,"Like a couple of the other reviewers here already said, this is a great book. I really don't care much for racing but Ed Hotaling really brought the story of Jimmy Winkfield to life for me. What an amazing life and what a fine book.Still, like the reviewer below noted, Hotaling glosses over the less-than-wonderful aspects of our hero's behavior, particularly towards his family. And given that this is probably the only book we're going to see on him for a while, it is a bit frustrating about all the information he leaves out. He never tells us where Winkfield is buried, nor does he go into any particular detail about what happened with his children or grandchildren. It's a somewhat slim book - 300 pages without the end notes - and I get the feeling that it was violently trimmed down in the editing.In any event, though, these are just minor gripes. Even if you aren't a big sports fan, this is a gripping read for anyone who loves books."
4,Stranger than Fiction . . .,"I learned of the book when I heard its author being interviewed on NPR. I have no interest in horse racing, but bought the book on the theory that a life this compelling must result in a book equally so. I was, in large part, correct. The writing style leaves a little to be desired, but this is a fast, and gripping, read. In the end, one is left with a real sense for what Winkfield's life must have been like."
1,"Paterson, NJ","Truly disappointed in this book. After reading several others on various citys by the same publisher I was excited when learning about my ""hometown"". Unfortunately the author missed many aspects of this city. She centers on the silk mills, movies, and current social trends but leaves out many of the other interesting parts of the city - there is not one mention ot the wealthy eastside. No mention of the many parks throughout the community. No mention of the role Paterson played during WWII with its massive Curtiss Wright engine manufacturing facility - I can still feel my home shake when they would test those engines! I was born in Paterson and lived there for my first twelve years but have fond memories of the various districts on the city -Italian, Greek, Russia, Dutch, etc. and their culture. I would hope that either the publisher Arcadia or the author revisit this area and do a more professional job of telling the story of Paterson, NJ!"
3,I want it cheaper,"Well, I was thinking of purchasing this for my adult daughter, who absolutely loves Invader Zim, but when I read that someone else bought it for $17, I didn't! By the way I, too, love Invader Zim. Best cartoon ever next to Courage the Cowardly Dog. (By the way, it wouldn't let me post this until I rated, but actually have nothing to rate it with.)"
1,Doesn't stick,"20 06 11It's claimed that Just4Copper doesn't stick to your hands when you knead it. That's true. Unfortunately, it also doesn't adhere well to the copper pipe. I sanded and wire brushed the pipe, kneaded the stuff, and applied as instructed about a 1/4"" of the mix around the pinhole leak. (Water had been drained for a few days.) Turned the water on after a day, and there was water oozing out around the edges of the patch. Greenish-colored water, I should add. A bit concerned about that. Now I must figure out a way to get the stuff off the pipe.I rate it ""zero stars"". Unfortunately the Amazon rating system demands at least one star. So be it.John Lukens"
1,What is listed is not what you get .. ..,"I bought this CD for a pilates workout. The box cover on the CD lists one set of tracks with names like dawn, begining etc by various artists. The label on the CD says ""Music for Pilates"". What you hear when you play the CD ..An album by Ravi Chawla ""Music to relax the mind - stretching"". The music is super s..l..o..w. Try working out to that!"
3,accessories will not work with Lexus Sc430,"I bought the cigarette lighter adapter to keep battery charged, it does not work because Lexus electrical shuts down when key is turned to off or removed. The accessory that has holes to attache to battery cable bolts will not fit the bolt size (very small holes). so now i am using it to keep a boat battery charged using the clips."
1,trickle charger,"this little trickle charger might work with a full battery but did not charge a dead battery even after staying on for 4 days.The instructions are extremely ambiguous, probably a machine translation.Why cant it read;buy this product if you want to do.....???it is already in the trash"
3,"Works okay, but instructions are vague","I read (and re-read) the instructions that came with this unit and in one section it has instructions to 'not' attach the clips directly to one post of the battery, but instead to have a length of wire attached to one of the posts if the battery is out of the vehicle. Later instructions don't say this. It's simple enough to attach one of the alligator clips to a ground on a battery installed in the vehicle, but I find it ridiculous to suggest that I need to attach a ""jumper cable"" to a battery outside of a vehicle, just to charge it.The leads (alligator and other) are just too short. Another 6 inches would have made them more usable.I do like that it fully charges the battery ad then goes in to a maintenance mode. I can leave it attached for a couple days without worrying about it."
5,Ctek Customer Service,I purchased this Ctek charger about 28 months ago and it just stopped working suddenly. The top row of LED indicator lights (the ones next to the battery charge level) would not light up anymore and after testing the charger with a volt meter I was not getting any reading. I contacted Ctek directly and told them what was happening and that I purchased the charger a little over 2 years ago (their warranty in the manual states it is only good for 2 years from date of purchase) and the woman I spoke with said no problem please send it into us and we will replace it. She didn't even need me to send in a copy of my receipt from amazon and didn't care that it was outside the warranty. Approximately 1 week after mailing the bad charger to them I got a brand new one in the mail. I was VERY impressed by their customer service!!! Great product and company!
4,Works Well,Like the small size. Seems to work well. The only thing I dislike is the battery clip connectors seem light weight.
5,CTEK 3300,"works great no problems, Does not get to hot even in the high 90's weather it was being used in when I first received it. It is being used for my wife's motorcycle. I will be buying 3 more for my lawn tractor, other motorcycle, and one of my cars that is only used every other week."
4,unit issues,Just received in mail.. got to work almost immediately installing the eyelet terminals on the battery.Plugged charger into electric cord and only the yellow light lit up.. put volt meter on output from charger 0 volts.Called CTEK and explained all items. advice was to return to where I purchased. Their assesment was that it wasdefective. I already have my return label and asked for a replacement and email received that the replacement was in process.Great customer service.
2,Doesn't seem to work. Second one ordered and both stop working,I ordered this battery Charger because I garage a car that is driven once a month and I wanted to keep the battery charged. I was able to start the car with this charger however when it was set up as a trickle charger it does not work.This is my second CTEK multi charger. The first one was ordered last year and I just assumed it stopped working now a second one doesn't work.I would not recommend this charger as a trickle charger.
4,"Met all,expectations","Works great. Met all,of my expectations. High quality and easy to use. Replaced my cheap Schumacher battery maintainer. Get one"
4,CTEK Multi US 3300,"My first charger arrived and did not work. I returned the charger (at Amazon's expense) and the second charger was sent ""next day"" via UPS. The CTEK 3300 is an extremely easy charger to use. It is small in size which is a plus. It is also less expense than the more well known charger brand. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 simply because the first charger did not work."
4,CTEX 12Volt Battery Charger /Maintainer,"I bought two of these at the same time. They work well keeping the batteries up. They haven't really proved making the batteries last longer. In fact I've had to replace both batteries within the time frame of using these units. They did have a few years age, but that seems to be the norm for Motorcycle Batteries. Then last year pushing the buttons to selcet off to un plug the unit/s from the battery is getting harder and harder. And the same goes for after riding one and putting it back on to charge it's tuff to get it to turn on and tuff to get it in the mode I want (Motorcycle) They are not in the weather but are in use every day. So far I'd have to say they are ok just wish the button selection would work like when they were new. I do really like they come with plug ins and aligator clips, wish it came with a power port adaptor (that's extra) Good luck."
4,Great charger. Get's a bit hot though.,"This charger works perfectly but the only reason I gave it 4 stars, not 5 is that it seems to run very hot. I even placed it on a metal plate so that some of the heat dissipates and it acts like a heatsink. I wonder if others have experienced the same issue. I have charged up several batteries already including a motorcycle battery and an Optima red and a regular car battery and the charger got hot when charging all 3."
5,Great for High End Sportcars,My husband uses this on his car when he won't be driving it for more than a week - sure beats calling AAA to come jump start the car. Easy to use.
4,Accurate but a little too basic,"I am by no means a scholar or student, just some that wanted to learn a little more about these words I kept hearing. The book turned out to be pretty informative and as far as I can tell pretty accurate. That being said, my complaint with the book was that it appears to have been aimed at about a high school reading level. I found it to be a little too simplistic for my tastes. I'm sure there are folks that this book would be perfect for, unfortunately, it was not what I was looking for. I was hoping for a little more depth."
1,Lame book of quotes,"Hi, I thought this was going to be a guide. But it is more a collection of quotes...some funny, some insightful, some inappropriate. Not worth the money"
5,GOOD BOOK,A very contemplative and convicting book. I ordered it for our son-in-law who teaches a Wednesday class for younger adults. He will probably be using this book as a guide.
2,Not best book on Idolatry,"I did not like this book at all. I have read books recently on Idolatry from a biblical standpoint. The book is alright depending on what approach to the subject the reader wants. I was looking for a scholarly approach to the subject and I just did not find it in this book. The book was just o.k. I would not recommend this to anyone. Books like Idolatry and Hardening of the Heart, God's Unfaithful Wife, and Counterfit Gods were exceedingly better presentations of the subject."
4,Soul-Searching,"This is an excellent study!!! You need to be wearing steel-toed shoes while reading it, though! It is very convicting and the author tells it 'like it is'I recommend this book highly if you want a closer walk with God!!"
2,UTP Cable Stripper,"Unreliable. This item appears to be a cheap imitation of the one I purchased at Lowes. It worked properly sometimes and other times it cut too deep, nicking the wire. I have chosen not to use it any longer."
4,GREAT for non-computer types!,"I bought this for my Dad last fall, and he's been on it ever since... It is sturdy, easy to follow, and completely fantastic for people who have never used a PC.I am looking at a 2nd--- as a gift. This has outstanding support, good technical information, and is as easy to use as it's advertised. One drawback? Scroll Mouse only--- which works until they ""get the hang of it"" and this unit is not upgradable.If you have a newbie, this is their system!"
1,Only a vehicle for MSN,"What we really need is an Internet Appliance which we can use for ANY ISP. Allow us the capability to add 802.11b, so we can place a terminal on a kitchen counter to use while making dinner, watch streaming video, listen to MP3, use to lookup recipes, etc.This is only really a vehicle for MSN, and should be avoided, unless of course, you don't have"
1,It do not float so well,"I got this line because the brand and the price. I got a 4wt line. I use this line with a 4wt,8 feet fly rod and it is good to cast in short distance and long distance. The belly of this line work perfect for make long distance cast using roll-cast or spey-cast. The biggest problem that i had with this line it is that since i got it, it sinks in the tip, and with the tip the fly."
3,Informative but labor intensive.,It is a step by step explanation of how to make a canvas rug. However she has you working too hard. The history and the pictures of the rugs are really nice. But if I didn't know about labor saving techniques and products I would probably never atempt to make one. I was hoping to get new ideas as I do make canvas floor coverings.
4,Good Book for very begginers,"If you know nothing about programming and you are curious about it then you should buy this book.Although it doesn't cover much of the fundamentals in programming with Visual Basic, it is very well written and the pictures very helpful in guiding you through your first steps, creating applications from the first pages.BUT, if you like what you see int his book and want to learn more, then you need to buy more books and spend much much more time.In general, if you want to have a hobby, and it's programming then this is your very first choice."
3,Look somewhere else,This book has lots of colorful pictures but is short on content. You'll learn about the various components of the VB integrated development environment but you won't learn much about how to get started learning to program.
3,A good overview...,"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers who indicated that this book was not good for begginer programmers both due to the content and the way the book is structured. HOWEVER for someone like me who has not programmed in VB for the past five years, it was a very good re-introduction to the language.I would suggest that after you go through this book you pick up Microsoft's Visual Basic 2005 Step-by-Step by Michael Halvorson. Even though it was written for the full version you can still accomplish 99% of the tasks using Visual Basic Express Edition and Visual Web Developer Express...ALSO don't forget to use the vast resources of training videos that Microsoft offers FREE of charge, coupled with the textbooks you should have no problem getting up to speed."
4,A fun little cook book!,"""A Little Book of Scottish Baking"" has some fun recipes that I really look forward to trying. It's size is also handy to take with me for when I'm giving cooking lessons to friends, unlike some of much larger ""tomes"" I have at home."
3,How boring can we make Music Theory?,"""Dry and testing"" is a perfectly accurate description. Maybe it is becuase I have a bias against most twentieth century music, but I really have a distaste for this book. I must say, the exercises are good. They helped me understand the material much more quickly than simply reading about it or listening to the author ramble on - he's dry and testing too. I suppose this book is decent enough for a class - given that the teacher is creative and uses other sources as well. I wouldn't want to keep it around afterwards as a reference."
5,Jack Chalker was back on form in 1996,"I was going to say that chalker is back on form, but the book was actually written three years ago. Hopefully, the spate of ""new"" chalker books coming soon will be just as good as this one. In The Sea is Full of Stars the author has blended the familiar elements of all Well World books with novel ones to create just the right tone, keeping you comfortable but interested. While the last Well saga was well written, it was mostly the same sort of story as the first set. Here we have the usual disparate group of seekers from the larger galaxy, but Chalker has definitely thought through some new concepts and problems for the planet/computer/ecological system that is the Well World. Ond day Del Rey may miss him; then again if media novels make bucks and that's all they care about, maybe they won't."
4,Deja Vu,"An interesting variation of the same original well world series. The first book is only an introduction to the second book. The characters are well disguised remakes of his previous characters. Almost all Well World series have Drug Lords with their planet fortresses, Evil Conquerors ( and their guilt ridden proteges ), body swapping and its psychological repercussions. But then thats what we all like about the well world series. So if you are a fan, go ahead and make your day."
1,Gone to the well once too often,I am an avid fan of Jack Chalker and have read all the previous Well World series with great enthusiasm but this latest two book set in the series was a major disappointment. The author creates detailed and interesting back story on all the major characters in book one and then practically dumps it all in book two in what amounts to a rush to finish the story. The point at which Wally steals the straight gate piece is amateur. And the ending when Ming and Ari are resolving basically the rest of their lives after their personal and emotional ordeal on the Well World and then end up in a tryst to end book 2 tells me that Chalker cared less for these characters than a non-fan. It almost feels like the author was limited to 2 books on this story and cut corners accordingly.
2,"Off the mark, cheaply done","Okay my 2.5 year old loves trains. But he doesn't just love pictures of trains, he loves the sounds- the chuffing, the whistles, the clackety-clack. He loves to study a scene before it cuts to the the next. I had to give this video a low rating because all it has is train scenes set to music. Hardly any train sounds and the scenes cut much to quickly for an interested child to digest. The whole video is smothered in this uppity folk music which is horribly repetitive. My son gave this a mild reaction and really hasn't asked to see it again much, which is remarkable. Now that being said, I finally got ""Choo-Choo Trains Up Close..."". That one is by far his favorite video in his entire library. Ahead of Elmos and Barneys he just loves the visuals and sounds. As I indicated in my review of ""Choo.."" it is obvious much more effort went into ""Choo.."" than in ""Lots..""."
5,Kids love it!,One of the best train videos we've ever owned. Our son watches this video more than any other train video. Won't go to sleep without it!
5,Award-Winner!,"This wonderful video has received a""Kid's First"" endorsement from the ""Coalition for Children's Media"" and approval from ""Parent's Choice""!"
5,Future Scrapbook,"In his book, The Future ScrapBook: Having the Design for Your Life, Nick Hall puts a new spin on the power of positive thinking by suggesting that if we can activate vivid and concrete thoughts about our wildest dreams they can come true. With a series of guided exercises the reader is taken through a step by step process of projecting and materializing the future rather than spending precious time collecting relics and reminders of the past.The book is fresh and alive with enthusiasm derived from the author's own experiences!Elinor White, Music Director, San Francisco Bay Area Theaters"
4,The always harmonious Hollies on an obscure album,"I found this album once in a library and it seemed to have limited release since no one seems to have heard of it. It has some great songs on it, especially if you have always liked the Hollies vocal harmonies. My personal favorites were Confessions of a Mind, Too Young to be Married, Isn't It Nice and Gasoline Alley Bred. I think this particular album may have been too ballady for its time since earlier Hollies hits seem to be shorter and poppier. The songs on this album seem almost like an experiment for them but if you are a diehard Hollies fan you will really like this album."
3,an average Hollies release,"""Confessions of a Mind"" is the all-out winner of a song on this release. It's sort of like their ""Surf's Up."" Lots of chord changes and different parts weaving in and out of each other. Would make Brian Wilson happy.Another good song is ""Man Without a Heart."" I don't like horns, but I like melody, and this song has a good melody. Good.I like the sound of the acoustic guitar throughout. It really reminds me of the sound of John Lennon's acoustic guitar on songs like ""That Boy"" [note: as recorded by the Beatles].Smelling fresh grass on an English Spring morning! Memories of Easter egg hunts!Dig yourself in. The guru is passing sliced bread your way. Take a bite of the warm bread and smile!!!"
5,awesome plates,These are the best plates!! We use them everyday.Not REAL pewter...but durable and looks like the real deal!!Love them!!!!
2,Her Vocal Quality is Slipping,"I won't repeat the faults found in many of the other reviews. Like most of Fleming's vocal interpretations I find her album cover picture to be oh so pretentious and precious rather than ""beautiful"" as some reviewers have found. Was that ""I am So Wonderful and Here I am Dreaming"" picture necessary? Her voice has become heavy and her mannerisms less than welcome. And the songs comprise a veritable hotch potch of overly recorded numbers with her singing varying from fine to ""Oh My God, what was that""!"
3,Somebody apparently forgot to pay the claque!,"Is this Renee Flemming's best effort? Not by a long shot, but it certainly doesn't deserve the thrashing it's getting here. What's wrong with a crossover album anyway? If it exposes more people to classical music, I think it's great.OTOH, if you're the type that regards opera as some sort of elitist bloodsport, give it a pass. For the rest of us, sit back and enjoy."
5,Greatness breeds envy and hatred,"Great artists, like Callas for example, are always at risk of hate-campaigns against them. Which is sad but sadly the world hasn't changed since then. I for one love Renee's voice and her singing. But I urge everyone to buy this or borrow it and listen to it to make up your own mind. Merry X-mas!"
1,Disappointed again,"I am always at a loss to understand why singers insist on singing music unsuited to their voices. I saw this concert on tv, and I was appalled at the vocal manipulation it took for Fleming to sing the Mozart Laudamus Te from the c minor mass, for one example, not to mention the fact that the version she chose to sing left out the difficult passages; I don't ever want to hear her sing anything from the Messiah again.Another dreadful CD to avoid."
2,Disappointing,"Let me just preface my comments by saying that I am a huge Fleming fan and consider her pretty much the gold standard for good singing, musical intelligence and character interpretation. (Her Manon! Her Countess! Her Desdemona! Her Rusalka...) Maybe that's why I'm so disappointed by this one. I'd figured a sublime singer and sublime material couldn't miss. But this recording is just so odd. In some spots it's overly produced and in others she seems oddly disengaged from the material. And very rushed. The Laudate Dominum seemed way too fast. And as someone else noted, the Panis Angelicus was atrocious. The flute intro was so wrong in so many ways. Way too bright and chirpy for such a profoundly devotional song. Cecilia Bartoli's prayerful rendition on ""A Hymn for the World 2"" (with Myung-Whun Chung) makes Renee's version seem circus-like. I just can't help but think Miss Fleming knows better than this."
3,Pretty but bland,"I'm a big Renee Fleming fan but I can live very well without this one. I did not like her Haunted Heart CD either, I think she should stick with what she does best and hope that her Daphne is the step in the right direction. Renee, you need no crossover to be heard, sing more Strauss and other rarities & leave the syrup and gloss to crossover birdies."
5,"Very, very beautiful","I am happy with this CD. It's beautiful, operatic and serene. Enjoy a great collection of Sacred Songs sung by a beautiful voice."
1,Il Divine Sacred Collection,"I thought this album was a real stinker but I have seen the light! I was so wrong! This is the best Christmas store album ever! I love listening to such soothing music when I am shopping, especially when all this wonderful junk is on sale! I fully support changing the name of this collection to ""Holy Mysteries Deep Within My Bosom"" too, that would be totally magical.I even have come to appreciate the stylistic choices like that interesting flute solo in Panis Angelicus, or the very very special version of Amazing Grace. Such wild trilling in Laudate Dominum or these crazy Messiah pieces, it all makes sense. Yes, Renee is having fun, she is finally free of boring old stuffy ""classical music"" section. Vive Le Crossover!"
4,Small but smells good,"These incents truly smell amazing, but the picture may be slightly misleading. Each of the sample packs contains 3 miniature sticks for a total of 24 mini incents. Each of which last only 15 minutes. The sampler pack is ideal to find smells you like, but not to sustain them. I think I would have been better off getting full sized sticks that burn for about 45mins. and come in packs of 10.A separate issue I had was with AmericaRX, whom was the seller I ordered from. They only offered a 4-14 day standard shipping policy, and on top of that it took these incents 19 days to arrive!"
5,Meaningful,"This film has all the qualities of a classic. A family picture with values. If you haven't seen it, rent it or buy it. An unusual grouping of actors, but it works very very well. In the tradition of James Stewart humor... classic and funny, yet the film has a deeper serious quality that reminds us how important a single life can be."
3,Good PS2 Keyboard,"This is a PS2 conventional keyboard to be used with desktops, not with laptops. Most of the laptops come with USB. It is a good fit for desktops."
5,Fine keyboard,I have several Logitech products including a superior optical mouse. The Logitech keyboard is performing as advertised. Logitech's reputation is growing...
1,No wonder it was in the bargain bin,"I'll make this short (since even though it purports to be of an expansive subject, the book itself is short): unengaging, unaccademic, unscholarly, with horrible citation. Wallace-Murphy and Hopkins don't seem to read classical languages, because whenever they cite a classical source, they have to take someone else's interpretation of it from another contemporary book. They cite their own or friend's works. Uses no primary sources. If you must read it, do so quickly and get on with better more authoritative books. Incidently, I didn't find the pictures very helpful, unlike another reviewer."
1,The Poorest Yet,"I have read many many books related to the subject Knights Templar and many of them strech their theories. This book is off the wall, misleading, and confusing. I would never recommend this book to anyone unless you didn't want to finish a book."
1,Rosslyn: Guardian of the Secrets of the Holey Grail,"One of the worst books I've read on the subject and I've read just about everything in and out of print. Poorly documented, badly written, full of conjucture and speculation which is passed off as fact. Makes great leaps of logic without any real proof. Kept reading it after the fist few chapters hoping for somthing of significant. It never materialized. Just a lot of sucking up to the St. Clair family. Don't wait your time or money."
3,An Interesting Read,"I read this book after reading 'The Hiram Key' by Lomas and Knight, so my views on Mr. Wallace-Murphy's research were a bit biased. However, after reading through the entire book, I have found it to be very informational concerning the physical layout and surrounding area(s) of Rosslyn. The only thing that 'tainted' the read is that he places too much emphasis on his esoteric views and tries to make history fit his beliefs instead of the other way around...otherwise, a great read with some really great pictures of the Chapel."
4,A Review from a 13 year old,"I thought this was a very thought provoking read. I always wondered if historians got history all wrong. I though this book was interesting. The only problem was, I got the book because I'm interested in the myths, legends, and history of the Holy Grail and the Knights Templar, but the book didn't have anything about the Holy Grail, and the Knights Templar wern't mentioned throughout half the book. I especially liked the parts on the evolution of the underground streams, dating back to the ancient intiation pathways on the Nile. I din't really like the chakra connection, and I don't subscribe to the acolyptic configuration theory, but the history is very good. I definly recomend this book to people intersted in the Knights Templar, Rosslyn chapel, and the Revelation of hidden secrets. A vrery intersting book!"
1,Skip it!,"I thought the book was going to be about Rosslyn Chapel, hence the title. But it was not. The first half of the book was spent dragging christianity down. The second 49% was about other cathedrals in France and Spain. A few pages at the end were about Rosslyn, but didn't say much. In fact neither did the rest of the book, more a ramble of thoughts and ideas. Nothing moving in a solid direction that lead to any insight you could believe in. What was the point??"
2,Poorly researched,"As with many books of this genre, the most spectacular conclusions are often based upon the shoddy research of a previous work. In the case of Rosslyn, the authors often quote their previous authored works or the work of others that have quoted other publications. In one case, the authors drew a major conclusion and quoted The Sign and the Seal (Harrison) as the source who had decifered the French text of the Rule of the Templars. Since I owned and had read both books I checked out the quote. Not only was the supposed quote non-existant in Harrison's book, it didn't exit in the original Rule of the Templars either. Very poor scholarship! I'm sure that there must be value in some of the information, but you have to question whether the book adds to the great body of grail work (I suggest Erma Jung's: The Grail Legend)."
1,Zero stars,"Horrendous and so derivative that I felt like I was in statistics class. Man, this was horrid. Boring, plodding, wasteful and not surprisingly, outclassed by every other book I've read in the genre--which isn't anything to brag about considering 95% of this stuff is garbage."
2,Not for serious Rosslyn students,"I bought this hoping for a serious explanation and study of the history and current events surrounding Rosslyn Chapel. Unfortunately this book was what some people would phrase ""esoteric nonsense"". I personally thought the author concentrated too much on the esoteric and not enough on the facts. I loaned it to some friends also interest in the history of the Knights Templar, the Freemasons, and the Holy Grail. Only one finished it and he said he would not recommend it.Let me put it this way, if you knew someone whom you wanted to ""initiate"" into this sort of study (i.e. Rosslyn Chapel, Rennes le Chateau, Holy Grail, etc.) this is not the book to give them. They will think you are a New Ager. However, if that is your thing this might be the book for you. Personally I want more facts, history, documented evidence, etc. I wish I could recommend a good book on this subject, but for now a web search provides the best information."
1,Very Disappointing,"I have heavily researched the knights templar, the early christian church, and the beginnings of freemasonry. After sifting through the first pages I bought this book. This book starts of strong, with a lot of true facts, by the middle of the book it drifts away from rossyln, which I thought was the purpose of the book. By the end of the book its heavily into mystic lines of force, trances, and other new age subjects. The authors get into a discussion of the new testament, as a student of ancient history it was obvious they had never studied the time or people they were writing about, only plagarized other writers fanciful notions that are more than abundant on the internet."
2,Disappointing,"Amongst all the books about Rosslyn that I have read, this one belongs to the bottom of the shelve. An alluring title, nice cover, quality print, but.... badly written, conjecture after conjecture, re-hashing of subjects that had already been covered by more established and respected authors. Simply not worth it, which is regrettable, because the book starts off well only to gradually loose its credibility."
2,"Good legal theory, bad history","The blurbs on the back give this book away. Law teachers and lawyers think it is excellent. No historians are included in any of this praise. As an exercize in rethinking the constitution this is an enjoyable, thoughtful piece of work. But Fletcher has not read much about Abraham Lincoln's actions and ideas. He is especially off course in claiming that Lincoln ignored the constitution in the midst of war. Lincoln practiced law for a quarter of a century, gave major speeches on the meaning of the constitution, followed the constitutional requirements on suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus--at least the leading constitutional lawyer in Congress, Reverdy Johnson, the patriarch of the American Bar, Horace Binney, and the profesor of constitutional law at Harvard thought.

5,Lot of fun at family gatherings!,I had played this game with my aunt years ago. Found it and it was just as much fun as I remembered. This game is great at family gatherings!
4,Surprisingly good (and that ain't an insult),"The other reviewers have mostly said it all; this is some excellent (if a tad genteel) 60s pop, and the songs--both the covers and originals--are absolutely top-notch. An interesting insight, though; this material, thanks to a brisk remix by Bob Irwin, makes one realize how much better American studios tended to be compared to British studios. The sound quality on the studio cuts is absolutely phenomenal!And let's not forget the Nuggets-worthy ""Put the Clock Back On the Wall,"" written by the Bonner/Gordon team (you know, ""Happy Together?"" ""She'd Rather Be With Me?"" The other wonderful songs they placed mainly with the Turtles?). The stereo remix here is nice, but is missing some effects of the old stereo (availible on one of the singular Nuggets disc) and the mono (availible on the boxed-set) mixes. I just felt that I should throw that in.Anyway, look, listen, enjoy."
5,"This group was incredible, how did stardom elude them?","It is about time that someone finally put out a disc by one of the most under-rated groups that ever strapped on a guitar. This 60's group stepped out of a garage from the ""wrong side of town"" in Salinas, California and were armed with enough talent to make it in the big league. Bad breaks and poor management were the only things that prevented them from reaching what they obviously deserved. Thank goodness these tapes remain. If you love the British Invasion sound you HAVE to pick up this disc. The E-types distilled all of the best of the English groups and created a sound all their own. ""Love of the Loved"" alone is worth the price of the disc. Kudos to Sundazed Music for releasing an incredible package. If you have any more E-types please release it!"
3,Product information...,"This is not a review of the product per se... but merely information to warn a prospective purchaser about misleading postings for this item. This product is the 10-track 1995 Collectables reissue on CD of the ""Last Kiss"" LP. An image has been posted showing the back cover of a compilation CD on the Teenager label. The Teenager CD has many more tracks than the Collectables piece. Verify which CD you're going to receive before ordering as if you think you're getting the larger Teenager CD, technically, this product listing is for the shorter Collectables item."
3,Misleading.,"I bought this for my car under the guise that is was black on both sides. It is not. The inside is black but the outside is white. I understand this is to reflect the sun but it was not what I was looking for. The picture is not representative of both sides of the product nor is the color mentioned in the product description. I'm giving it 3 stars because it works as it should and it is a quality product, just not described accurately."
4,no title,"Warning - do not read this if you do not want to know how the book ends.What an odd little book. Whatever else it is, it is haunting, even though I feel the ending to be a cheat somehow. But something in me saw it coming, felt that Paul was not dead, just not in the way the book has him. To have changed identities with Wexford Bone? And in all these years did he ever paint again? Now he is a murderer? It was he who killed Walter and Edna Haggard? For the author to do this has completely diminished the power he had so painstakenly built up in him as an artist of worth. Now he's just a demented killer. It was such a wonderful story of the artist. Now. It's been cheapened. Went for the jolt to the reader, the shock value. I feel let down."
5,Lots of Fun!!!,I ordered this costume for my husband to wear to a 70's party. He looked great and he has worn it to two more parties since then. Lots of fun!!
4,"Good, but it didn't make me want to read it more than once.","The text on the back of the book:I'm Augie Lloyd and I feel like I'm eighteen going on ninety. I've always been impatient with people who aren't as smart as me. But the truth is that's just for show. In actuality, I'm scared to death. With two professor parents, it's no wonder I've exercised my mind a lot. But my body? Forget it. None of the guys from school came near me--and I'd never even had a date.Enter Sam Feldman. He's a gorgeous former athlete from California. His parents are incredibly rich and he used to have everything--even an equally gorgeous girlfriend. But an awful car accident put him in a wheelchair. Now he's at my school in New York City and I'm tutoring him...So here we are, the unlikeliest duo in the history of the world. Al of a sudden I don't know who I am or what I want. No one ever told me love would be like this..."
5,Charming as always,"Poor Miss Suzy always seems to be having an existential crisis, but she is SOOooooo cute and so are the other squirrels. And as always, everyone is warm, safe and happy by the end!"
2,not that fun,My African gray didn't enjoy this one that much as it slides open too easily and the seeds spill because it points at an angle downwards.
5,Joey's favorite toy,"My Conure loves this toy. He took to it very quickly and can now open it in just a few seconds. In spite of how easy it is for him, he never seems to get bored with it."
4,used audio tape,My used audio tape was very reasonably priced and arrived exactly as described. I hope I can buy more cheap audio tapes and CD's.
2,Version not approved by Vatican or U.S. Catholic Bishops.,"Not a proper translation! In a memo circulated in May 2003 to all bishops in the United States the chairman of the US bishops Committee on Review of Scripture Translations said The Holy Bible: New Living Translation, Catholic Reference Edition has not been approved by the U.S. bishops or the Vatican. This approval is required by Church law.Tyndale is aware that the translation lacks Catholic approval but is continuing to sell the book and represent it as Catholic!"
1,Easy to read Translation!!!,"The New Living Translation is not a translation per say, but is a paraphrase; the gist of the message is still there, but there are so many GOOD translations out there you don't need this one. I perfer The Revised Standard, The New Revised Standard, The American and The Douey Versions (all cathloic Versions). Also, For easy to read and more accurate translations I would look into the English Standard Version and the Holman Christian Bible. if you like the Living for readability also get one of the aboved mentioned for study."
5,An exceptional example of erudite research!,"Dr Hunsberger's biography of the seminal Persian poet and philosopher is a must read for anyone curious about the state of affairs in the Middle East a millennium ago. Her exhaustive research and insight gives ballast and meaning to the personality of Nasir Khusraw as well as his travels and his journals. I highly recommend Dr Hunsberger's most-amazing book to any scholar devoted to Middle Eastern, Arabic, Persian or Islamic studies. Nasir was a dedicated scholar and so is Dr Hunsberger."
5,Great Metal band!,"Who on Earth would call the Bulletboys, Van Halen wannabees? That is such foolishness! They don't sound anything like Van Halen! Bulletboys had their own sound and it was great! As far as this album goes, it's one of those you put in and turn it up as loud as your speakers will tolerate! And for the songwriting, what do some of these people want? It's not suppose to be intellectually sound by any means. It was straight forward, metal in your face, partying Rock 'n' Roll! So, take it as that and enjoy! And as for Van Halen, they are my favorite band of all time, so I'm definately not knocking those guys by any means."
5,Classic hard rock,"This is one of those rare albums that are solid from beggining to end! I played my cassette so much I eventually wore it out and will have to pick up a CD copy soon. I however find the vocals to be closer to Marc Storace of Krokus or Bon Scott of AC/DC then they are to David Lee Roth, and the band has a much harder edge then original VH. If you love to rock while driving, this album is a top choice!!!"
2,bulletheads,"The Bulletboys CD, titled ""Bulletboys"" is a disappointment, if you ask me.There's some OK tracks like ""Smooth up in you"" and ""Shoot the preacherdown"", but over all, the production could of been alot better. Ted Templeman, who also produced the early Van Halen albums is not, in my opinion a good producer. The later Van halen albums with Sammy Hagar whichhad different producers,to me sounded better and had alot more to offerthe listener. I gave the Bulletboys CD two stars. Thank You."
3,Low quality hair metal,"This band is decent, but they are not comparible to David Lee Roth era Halen. This is a corporate metal record if there ever was one. Bulletboys are like a third string Skid Row. If you want a good hair metal debut, try Skid Row, Winger, Ratt or Dokken."
3,Good album,"Growing up in high school when this album was released, listening to it on CD now takes me back in time, when we were blasting this stuff at parties and cruising the strip. Not my favorite band, and I tire of the singers shouting style of singing, but it's still worth the price. If you grew up in the 80s and 90s, this CD is a ""should"" have."
1,Strap ripped after minimal use,"My daughter's school prefers for kids to use tote bags instead of backpacks for kindergarten and this bag seemed like a perfect choice. I was satisfied with the quality when I received it, but after only a week and a half of light use, one of the straps ripped off. The bag only held my daughter's lunch bag and a small water bottle, so nothing heavy and she's not the sort of kid who'd be throwing this around. My reusable shopping bags from grocery stores have held up much better than this bag."
4,Great tote bag for everyday essentials.,"I love this tote bag. Its used for my everyday commute. Its very strong and I love the fact that it's washable. I can fit my lunch, cosmetic bag and a pair of office shoes - it also has two smal compartments for keys, cell phone, etc. - it doesn't fasten at the top -but that's not an issue with me."
3,OK,I am a tote bag freak! I love them! This one isn't too bad...and I use it once in a while. However if I had seen this in the store I probably would not have purchased it.
1,PRODUCT SAFETY WARNING,"BE WARNED: The Essential Tote Bags are delivered with tags that say, ""This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm."""
1,Not what I was expecting,This bag looked nothing like its photo. It is huge and flimsy in comparison. DISAPPOINTING.
4,Finally Found a Perfect Bag,"This bag is just right for my work. Files, three dictionaries, three note books, schedule book, lunch, small thermo pot, phone, keys... hold a lot yet it is notlook like ""Student bag"" or "" book bag"". It's great. Only thing I don't like is its smell but I'm hoping it will gone soon."
5,TOTE BAG review,"The bag is perfect for my ""stuff"". I ride a commuter bus to work and it's just the perfect size for my books, lunch, etc. I'm really a neutral person, but, thought I would go for a bright color. The color is great!"
5,Great Tote and Great Price!,"I was looking for a great tote bag at a cheap price and I was pleasantly surprised at how nice, and sturdy this tote is! I will definitely be buying more!"
2,"The Bag is OK, but it comes without any hard base.","The bag is OK, but it comes without any hard base, and without the hardbase the bag kind of sinks down if you put anything in it..."
3,it worked,"I used these bags as gift bags for my wedding party. It was handy for the girls to carry all their ""stuff"" in on wedding day. Very sturdy and a good bargain."
3,Versatile,"Product is good, but don't put too-too many heavy things in the tote otherwise you'll run risk of breaking seam of handle. Otherwise its great"
2,Ok bag,"The quality of the bag is thinner, but still usable. They really need to put the measurements of the straps in the description because this is definitely not a ""tote"" that you can easily sling over your shoulder. More like forearm."
3,Shipping costs way too high,Great bag for the price although the straps are a little short. I bought 25 of these for an event and the shipping was more than the cost of the bags. Crazy.
4,Great Deal!,"First of all, I can't believe this bag only cost $5! It arrived quickly and looked exactly like the picture. It is the perfect size for the huge binder I'm currently carrying in it. My only wish is that the material was substantial enough to hold the shape of the bag when it's not full, but it serves its purpose and is a great deal for only 5 dollars."
1,will return this bag,"In small print on a tag that most people probably won't read it says:""This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm.""I will be returning this bag."
5,My opinion,why do you choose this rating: Due to that the service and quality are excellentwhat do you like or dislike? All like to meWho would you recommended this products to? I recommended all persons
4,Simple and sturdy,"I got this tote bag to hold extra books, random items with my purse/bookbag. The handle and the bag itself are a nice sturdy material. The pocket on the side are nice.The only thing I would like more is a zipper on the top. Other that, it's a nice simple bag for a good price."
3,I want both,"Cuba Gooding Jr.'s performance in this was amazing, no question. The film itself was mediocre, at best. It set itself up well enough, lagged badly in the middle, then took a few turns that seemed out of character. I enjoyed seeing the cast ensemble, most of whom seem to have played the same role across several films. I found it an interesting study in how much culture has changed regarding the discussion and social treatment of mentally challenged individuals. I don't know that the system treats them any better, but several times through the film I had to remind myself of the timeframe."
4,A touching and haunting movie!,"From time to time we feel with evident relief, that fortunately not all film makers bet for break necks, breathtaking car chases, burning streets, flying corpses or extreme violence as a tenet to get audience and a brief fame.This script falls apart these common places to tell a story; a poignant portrait of a weak man who is connected to the outside world through this device.A penetrating and captivating story that it will you make think about the life' s values. Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. make top-notch performances."
4,This is a great movie,"This is a movie about a handicapped guy who walks around with a cart. He gets a chance to help coach a football team, and it makes him happy. It also makes him do good stuff. In the face of opposition from parents and others who didn't think this young man was capable of anything, Radio manages to overcome everything and acheive his dreams, however simple they may be. This movie has a good moral, and is definitely worth seeing."
5,Hollywoods better work,"Interesting true story, great movie that teaches leadership and humanitarian techniques so often lost in present productions. This is a high yield program, thought provoking and entertaining. Ed and Cuba again provide the standard for acting Hollywood should adopt."
3,Very funny but in questionable taste.,"I think we all have laughed at the expense of retards before, it sure is fun AND easy but sometimes it makes us feel less than perfect about ourselves. I feel the same way about this film. It was hard not to laugh when Radio was tied up but as a father to a retarded son I couldn't help but to feel bad about my laughter.So as a comedy it gets the job done but if you want to feel good about yourself afterwards I recomend Mel Brooks' Spaceballs"
1,Mawkish and insipid,"Cuba's performance is an embarrassment, and the script is so laden with well-meaning platitudes that it grows nauseating after a while. I felt bad for Gooding; he really seemed desperate for another Oscar nomination, and to my eyes he seemed to be trying way too hard. Toward the end it gets so sugary sweet I felt my teeth begin to ache.Unless you're easily manipulated by cheap sentiment, or are a sucker for ""inspiring"" true stories, then stay far away. I had to turn off this movie several times and walk away, just to control my gag reflex, it was so bad. I'm amazed people are giving it such good reviews...but then, there are people who will praise anything."
1,Dumb Movie!,This movie is dumb because Radio gets picked on and i did not like that. I also didn`t like when his mom died. Thats all i have to say.
1,half hour movie,"Remember the Titans Reprise. The tedious scenes cut off at odd moments and move too far ahead in the future to gain any personal connection with ""radio"". Many scenes should have been left on the cutting room floor. I would have enjoyed this movie had it been on television during a 20/20 segment. If you liked remember the titans and need another sports movie with a classic rock soundtrack...."
3,Sad movie,Radio is a very sad movie. I can not bring myself to watch it again. I personally would not allow a young child to watch it.
3,Radio: Heartwarming But Predictable,"This film, starring Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr, tells the story of a mentally retarded South Carolina boy called Radio(Gooding) who is taken in by a local high school football coach named Harold Jones(Harris). Though Jones' compassion towards the boy will melt the hearts of some, others may be put off by the rather predictable ending. Halfway through the film I already knew that someone would try to get rid of Radio becasue of his differences. Predictable films are an unfortunate trend."
4,"great story, gret acting, feel good afterwards","Cuba Gooding is so good at his role in this movie, and the stroy just gets better and better...it is amazing to think that it is abased on a true stroy, i really enjoyed the football aspect of it with my husband and he showed his tender side watching this film with me, its a great buy"
1,Waiting,"I'm just starting to get a little concerned. Although I'm on the other side of the world, I was assured the product would arrive within a month. I'm not angry, just worried."
2,Tugs too hard,"Radio tug too hard on the hhard strings, and comes out a long, tedious movie. Good actors wasted. A better movie is ""Remember the Titans."""
2,Not a good movie,"This movie tries to be dramatic and sad, but that makes it really funny. Movies now days that try to do this are never good because the only good ones are old. Plot moves quickly and the football scenes are neat. Bad acting and the dramatic lines are predictable."
5,Melt,I won't recap the storyline but simply agree this movie will soften the hardest heart. Incredible acting by Cuba Gooding Jr. and Ed Harris. This is a must-see film in a cynical world.
5,Awesome Movie,"This movie was wonderful. I cried the whole time almost, but it was happy at the ending. Wonderful casting, they all did super jobs in their rolls. I rented it, but went out and bought it the next day! Great movie, i recomend it to anyone."
4,VERY GOOD MOVIE,"LOVED THIS MOVIE- GOODING, JR WAS GREAT IN HIS ROLE. ED hARRIS ALSO VERY BELIEVABLE."
5,I love this movie!,I had heard mixed reviews about this movie so I delayed seeing it. I loved Cuba in Jerry Maguire. But this movie kept showing up on my amazon list of movies I might be interested in. So...I watched it last night. I didn't know what to expect. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop but it didn't and I'm glad. I loved this movie and will be adding it to my collection. Cuba played a charming Radio! Ed Harris was wonderful and I was surprised to see Debra Winger (a fav of mine) playing such a quiet role. Such an uplifting movie! So glad I watched it. I'm going to stop paying so much attention to reviews..
5,Good value,New product and great product for the price. Will order again from this vendor when I see other movies I like
3,music,"The music is beautiful,BUT, why don't they do an album in english? They did a song on Josh Groban's album ""Awake"", and it is so beautiful."
2,Awful dubbing ruined a good movie,"I saw this (and the previous D13 movie) in French with good subtitles and loved them.I saw the first D13 movie dubbed into American and enjoyed it the second time around, but the folks I watched it with agree that it would have been better subtitled.I tried to watch this and didn't get 10 minutes in before the dubbing drove me insane and I turned off.Sad, because it's a good movie but the poor dubbing and no option of subtitles spoilt it"
3,French with Subtitles,"It's hard to consider the French as bad asses. It's like having a bunch of 25 year olds running around in skinny jeans, trying to be tough guys."
4,Good Action,This movie has a good plot and a lot of action. This is not a blood and guts movie but a lot of fighting scenes. A good movie for age 14 and up.
4,awesome,Great action film that will keep your interest throughout the movie. The stunts were siimply amazing. Sharing this movie with family and friends.
5,A great action movie for any parkour fan!,"You get it all in this film-- hot action, a great story, and gorgeous men with insanely sexy French accents. What more could a girl ask for?"
4,It's entertainment,"We enjoyed the first one more, which is funny since we noticed and bought the 1st movie based on our purchase of this one.The problem is they did such a great job with the first one that they needed to reach a bit higher with the second one and didn't achieve this, imo.What I would recommend is owning both & watching them one after the other since Ultimatum immediately takes off from the first one and resumes the story line.As a set, I'm glad I have both as it makes for a complete evening's entertainment.You certainly can't complain about the stunts, they're terrific."
3,settles for mediocrity,Couldnt agree more with other reviewers - This one is trash compared to the first. I would rather sit and watch David Belle on youtube than watch this in HD. Why get David Belle and Cyril Raffaelli if you arent gonna use em to the fullest? Could have hired no names to piece together action sequences......
2,Guess I'm just to Americanized.,"Just did not work for me. The action was weak, unbelievable. Writing was not very strong. Maybe the actors are very popular over seas and that's what carried the movie. But I would not recommend it to anyone."
3,I liked the first but,I won't comment because there's was nothing out ordinaryhas the same type of fights and same goverment issues.
3,Freestyle running film falls flat,"Do not let this film discourage you from seeing the first one. It has some okay stunts but eventually runs flat using such things as a fight using a painting for instance may have been ok back in the days when Jackie Chan was doing it in the 90s, but nowadays, it lacks believablity. Don't get me wrong, if you are even considering this movie, you are probably an action junkie and can overlook paper thin plots but, There are only a handful of really impactful oohs and ouches barely shown in the right way and in result just not enough. You think in the end... wheres the big face off? Rent it."
1,Terrible,"If you liked the first one, DO NOT watch this one. The first one was full of kick ass stunts, this one is like a Steven Seagal movie. The second one definitely pussed out, they do slow motion replays, i mean come on."
3,A Lesson in Unconditional Love,This is a book that you will probably read in one sitting. It will capture your attention especially if you have had the opportunity to hear Patricia Morgan and her daughter talk on the radio. I was touched by the honesty that Pat displays in the book and I was especially moved by the unconditional love that she arrived at. This will appeal to anyone who has ever struggled with a difficult relationship. It might just be the key to your enlightenment.
3,"Nice Album, A Bit Dated Though","Unfortunately, I listened to this album the first time twelve-years after it was initially released. As a result, the prevailing weakness is its place in history. Miller's humor is so based on the fact he likes to read the morning paper, the fact he still gets a residual check at all from this sucker is probablely a shock to him. Despite that, it is classic Miller, and you see the younger, and less mellow, comedians really take stabs at the era. I think it is a funny album that you will enjoy. There is an annoying that it only has two tracks on the disc. This is fine if you don't get interrupted or don't want to rehear something; and given the fact he makes his money with strings of misplaced descriptions it can be a real pain. Overall, I would recommend this album, but I would look elsewhere for big laughers."
4,Dennis Miller when he was still funny,"As much as it pains me to recommend anything by a guy who has since morphed into an hysterical, reactionary, completely unfunny right-wing nutjob, this CD is really quite good. This is Dennis Miller when he was sarcastic, witty, and smart; in other words, Dennis Miller before he crawled up W's ... to secure that almighty ditto-head dollar. Unfortunately I'm sure that buying this CD will help to further enrich this disgusting pig, but perhaps if a lot of people buy Miller's older work, he'll realize that pandering to the right isn't winning him any new fans."
2,Timeless? Nah.,"I think Dennis Miller is one of the brightest comedians out there today, but this CD is in no way representative of that. Given Miller's penchant for jamming as many pop-culture references into his monologues as possible, the material is very dated, and he seems to be relying on that and his ironic stance to carry him through--it gets kind of old. I listened to this once, and feel no need to revisit it again. Ten years or so down the road now, Miller has a cable tv show and has compiled his ""Rants"" into audiobook form (now up to three, as I remember)--these hold up much better. You can hear his mind working on more substantive material instead of the trivia, and he is just naturally funny in his ticked-off way. To put it plain--he has gotten better since this one."
3,Interesting early effort,"This album is an interesting early effort, but lacks the polish of WCPAEB's later releases. I really wish someone would put them out on CD!!"
2,Nothing Like there later Major Label releases,"I bought this when it came out because I'm a big fan of the West Coast Pop Experimental Band Major Label releasesVol 1, 2 & 3When I listened to this sits not very Psychedelic at all and it really sounds almost like a whole other bandI don't know a bigger fan of this band then me I have all their stuff on CD and record but this is really not worth bothering with."
2,Pure Garage Rock!,"No sophistication here! Down to earth garage rock - not unlike Standells or early Paul Revere.The is a reissue of their rare 1966 Fifi album. Production very cheap, but lots of raw energy.Well known favorites like ""Something You Got"", ""Louie Louie"", ""You Really Got Me"", ""It's All Over Now Baby Blue"" and ""She Belongs to Me""Mixed with fine originals of more melodic such as ""Don't Let Anything Stand in Your Way"", ""I Won't Hurt You"" ( Buddy Holly inspired ) and ""Sassafras""Interesting versions of Left Banke's ""She Must Call You Up Tonight""The bonus tracks are generally in poorer sound quality, ""Chimes of Freedom"" fine and heartfelt.My Favorite tracks are ""It's All Over Now Baby Blue"", the Buddy Holly inspred ""I Won't Hurt You"" and ""She May Call You Up Tonight"""
5,It's all GOOD!,This is the island beat mixed with Praising the LORD! The best of the best. Having a wonderful time with my Sister (in-law/out-law) drinking a glass of wine and singing praises heart felt! Lovely!!! We danced!!!
1,A Hair Shirt by any other name still smells like crap...,We covered the premiere of Too Smooth (then called Hair Shirt) when it premiered at the 1998 Toronto International Film Festival.The film was almost unwatchable then and age has just made it more moldy. It's easy to see why it took three years and a name change to get a distributor...for a straight to video release. As we said three years ago:You would think that Neve would use a small role in a self-produced flick to try new things. Only Neve doesn't have new things. The film only goes to show that right now Neve has a pretty limited acting range. That annoying squint and giggle thing that she seems to do in all of her films.There's a million other more deserving flicks to buy on Amazon.
5,Great movie! How did I miss this in the theatres?,"I love this movie! This is the best independant film I've seen in a long time. This rivals Fast Times and Clueless and it's a Neve Campbell movie with Rebecca Gayheart and Katie Wright! What more could you want??!!!Actor\Director Dean Paras knew what he was doing! This is a wonderful romantic comedy with REAL characters. Obviously I highly recommend it. I can't believe I missed it in theatres, I'm a huge Neve Campbell fan and this is probably her best work! And she's great in everything! Check it out! Immediately!Jimmy"
1,spend yout time elsewhere.,"Just because Rebecca Gayheart is gorgeous, it doesn't make this movie worth renting. I wish I rented Whipped again and I didn't like that movie either. Next time I am clueless on what to rent and pick a low budget movie like this one, I'll stick with my DVD collection and watch Road Trip for the billionth time, (at least it's funny). The cute combo of Katie Wright and Gayheart was the only reason I was able to make it through this movie. Other than that, it stunk."
4,Good ideas,I may not use theses lessons exactly has they are but there are a lot of ideas to be taken from this book. Happy with it.
4,Increases appreciation of one of Hollywood's Greats,"Chronicles the professional life and accomplishments of one of Hollywood's most loved stars, Burt Lancaster. I was disappointed with the lack of insight into the personal life of Lancaster, but as a biography of his professional life it was excellent. It was fascinating to read of the diametrically opposite views that co-stars and directors had for him, ranging from ardour to hate. This is an unbiased portrait of a great star"
1,No breakfast for me.,"Mountain House makes great camp food, but these are the first true disappointment from this brand. My eggs were powdery and dry. There was a pool of water at the bottom of the bag. It was almost as if the eggs didn't absorb the water and the water just sank to the bottom. I was able to find a few chunks of good eggs, but for the most part, it was not edible. That said, the rest of MH's products are excellent and I will buy their other products again. They just need to work on their eggs."
1,Ripoff,"This advertisement stated the original price was $29.40 and on sale for $6.85. When I ordered this product, the ""product features"" stated ""6 per pack."" So, with a regular price of $29.40, comes with 6, you'd assume you are getting 6 for the $6.95. Wrong. The $29.40 regular price, now on sale for $6.95 is a marketing scheme. This is a misleading RIPOFF. BTW I normally enjoy all of mountain house's freeze dried foods. I will not purchase from this supplier again."
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"The item was listed as 2 packs of 6 pouches, I received only 1 pouch not even 1 pack of 6 or 2 pouches, but just 1 pouch!!!"
2,Was decent but...,"It was eatable, but not very good. Not worth the price in my opinion. A big bag of jerky would be a better choice for camping/hiking"
1,Deceptive Advertisement Details,"I have not used my single pouch of dehydrated eggs and bacon yet, I trust that it will taste reasonably good but of course not perfect. However, you'll get your other 4 stars, when I get my other 5 pouches. :)"
1,Problems!,"My right speaker went out almost immediately. Also, iSound was advertised as having AC power, which it did not. I'm very disapppointed! Finally, poor quality construction. I'm still trying to find a good portable unit."
5,Fabulous iron,"Easy to use, great features, happy wife. What else can you ask for? For 9 years, my wife has used the old Black and Decker that I inherited from my father and used for many years as a bachelor myself. It finally died, and Amazon had this great iron at a steal of a price. My wife loves it. The visible water fill level is fantastic, as is the adjustable steam quantity and extra burst. We weren't concerned about no auto-shut off since the old iron had none, and my wife is a seamstress. Other reviewers doing sewing complained that the auto-shut off was annoying when working with materials over an extended period. The only weakness with iron is the flimsy water fill cover. One little bump with it open and it will break off. It's a great feature though, since water spills make a mess. No real complaints overall, especially for $30."
4,Lots of steam to spare,It has an ergonomic handle and is lightweight. My wife likes the fact that it releases plenty of steam to remove those stubborn wrinkles.
1,Cute but cheap...,"This toy is adorable, however, the day we received it both leaves fell right off the top...which to me is a chocking concern. If you're going to make a dog toy (and ours is not a huge chewer, they simply fell off while she was carrying the carrot around in her mouth by the leaves) you should make it sturdy! I would not suggest this dog toy."
4,Stealth / Blue Thunder Double Feature DVD,Stealth is a excellent movie and Blue Thunder Is a Good movie from years ago . Overall Very worth the money !!!!
3,sexy but might hurt ya...,"i loved this shoe when i saw it - love the sexy allure - the funky of patent leather - but when it arrived it was cumbersome to me - ill fitted in the front and your foot slips and slides about... i would have returned it - but thought it would be to ill of a process and the shoe no boubt is still sexy. i am going to have my shoe shop stretch the shoe a bit and place a no slide ""thingy"" at the toe bed and hope for the best."
1,where is my bag,"The website says ""In Stock"", after order it, email say ""the bag recently got sold out and will have to be made to order. Estimated shipment is in 7 days."" I ordered on 4/12, and I have not receive my bag even one month later. I send them another email 3 days ago and no one get back to me yet. I am not happy."
1,It did not work!,"I bought it along with my SONY VAYO FS 550 and never worked, it always gives me a fatal error message when I start the software. Really disappointing."
3,Video Converter,"The equipment itself is compact and convenient, but in order to get a good quality product, invest in better software. Also, although it indicates that it can also do audio conversion (eg: cassette), it converts as though it's the audio portion of a video. So you still have it in video format; another software is needed to convert from video file to wma, mpeg, etc."
4,Simplistic Conversion,Converter works well. Fast set up and ease of use. Provided editing software is slightly less friendly. I found using out of the box Windows Movie Maker worked fine for me and yielded good results.
2,Medium Quiality Captured Video,"I bought this PX-AV100U Plextor Video Capturing Device just to have a different alternative for capturing video than my USB Pinnacle Systems Moviebox. The Plextor device driver installation was made without problem (so the InterVideo WinDVD Creator Software). The box works fine. You get a MPEG format file as result from capturing analog video (Beware : this MPEG file ,wich Plextor says it's a MPEG2 format, can't be opened by Pinnacle Systems Studio Plus software as a MPEG2 file). If you want the best quiality video in your final DVD or Video File, then this device is not for you. No comparison between the Plextor PX-AV100U and the USB Moviebox Deluxe regarding the output video quality (With Moviebox you get a very superior video quality ). About InterVideo WinDVD Creator Software, it has the basics. Easy of using it, but runs much slower than the Studio Plus when generating a video file. If quality is not important, Plextor PX-AV100U is a cheap alternative."
1,Does Not Work For Me,"I bought this device to copy dozens of VHS and HI-8 home movies to DVD. My PC met and exceeded the specs needed for this, and I followed the installation instuctions perfectly. Yet when I went to copy a VHS tape the picture was very grainy at the highest quality setting of the WinDVD Creator 2 software that came with the unit. It actually looked worse than the original VHS tape!After two useless phone calls to Plextor's support line, I am returning this and looking for something else."
5,"Fast, great quality","Product arrived just as described in great working condition. Fast shipping, fast service, thank you!"
2,adequate for standard quality. not easy to install.,"After a good deal of messing around to get it working, I can now capture at standard rate. High quality capture is ""supported"" but is jerky and unusable.The installer says my system is not supported. I'm guessing they didn't update the installer for Windows 2003 Server. But if you can work around that it works. Sort of.My needs are very simplistic and the stuff I'm capturing is not high quality, so I will keep this device. If you need good quality, you might want to research this device carefully before purchasing."
3,Works great but not as high quality as I had hoped.,I suppose I really should have read the specs closer. I can't get the video produced to exceed 640x480. It's max rated at 720x578. The software that comes with it (WinDVD) simply won't run on my equipment. It crashes immediately and InterVideo doesn't want to even talk about it. Roxio works fine with it though. This product probably shouldn't be your first choice for transferring those VHS tapes to DVD.
4,My first experience with Plexor Digital Video Convertor,"This is the first time I have purchased an item like this, so I was not sure exactly how it works. The item was pretty easy to install, but the manual it comes with does not go into any further detail on how to use it. I was pretty much on my own to figure out how to use it. It does work well, but for some reason I am not getting any sound, so I am still working to figure out why. The product does make very nice screenshots, and so far it is working the way it's supposed to."
5,Nobody grooves like Marcus Miller period.,"This DVD is spectacular I bought it back in 2002 and I watch it all the time the Legendary Marcus Miller is hands down the best bass guitarist in the world today period. Nodbody grooves like Marcus from his unmistakable distinct sound to his amazing style of playing.The band emsamble on the dvd is great their chemistry was on point. Marcus Miller's Jazz is so unique not like that average,contemporary elevator Jazz you'd hear on the radio, Marcus Miller's music has a sound all its own. Marcus Miller wrote all of the songs that were performed even ""Tutu"" alot of people get confused even though Miles Davis performed that song on his album entitled ""Tutu"" Marcus Miller is the one who wrote the song. My favorite songs would have to be between the mellow groove Tutu and funky fast paced Scoop . This DVD I would recommmend to any Bass Guitarist, Marcus Miller or Jazz fan."
4,I enjoyed this,"Marcus Miller is a Very Talented Cat&together with a Tight Band the Music was Grooving for the most part.He Makes Jaco Proud with His Take on""Teen Town"".Marcus Miller brings in a Good Solid Performance here.the Band is on point for me as well."
3,Be Warned.,"Don't get me wrong, Marcus Miller is a great musician. But this is not, in my books, a great DVD. There are only sixtracks. ""Teen Town"" and ""Portrait of Tracy"" do NOT feature on this DVD. It is only 60min long. And keyboardist Morris Pleasure (??) ruins it utterly with his cheesy posturing and 80s-LA-metal-guitar-soloing. The man has no taste. If you are considering buying this DVD for the bass playing, you might as well do yourself a favour and get the Wooten one instead. You'll learn more."
5,gods of rock,The Fuzztones have always been the Gods of Rock. It is a shame there are so many music-heathens out there that should be fervent disciples!
4,Mary Beth,"It was just what we would expect from such human atrocities. Is there really any ""closure"" while we are still here in this world? It is even harder to bear because she is the female look alike of her father! What do we take away from this lesson in life? The world does not know God-the human heart longs to be loved................God is love."
4,"Intense, Accurate, Raw, Excellent",This documentary is very intense and sad. But worth the time to watch. It was excellent.. This history should never be forgotten... the genuine emotions displayed are heart warming
4,"It's informative and well done, i definately felt the pain, confusion, and terrible sadness of a childhood torn apart...for BOTH","It was a well done film that made you feel the HORRIBLE pain endured by both women during the war. The problem I have, you can not possibly compare what each woman went through. Each suffered, true, but in VASTLY different ways, there is no comparison. An interesting film, definitely worth seeing."
5,Unblievable story,This is the most heart wrenching story I have read or heard about. I had such sympathy for Monika Herting. She never had the suport group to help her through her terrible times where as Helen Rosenzweig did have emotional help when she needed it. Helen carried carried such a heavy burden for years. Sins of the father is never the fault of the children. Helen is now talking to young people and doing charity work through different outlets. She is to be admired and loved for her courage. Helen was not as warm towards Monika as I would have liked. No one is holier than thou.
5,RAD,THE MOVIE WAS AWESOME FROM WHAT I CAN REMEMBER IT FROM. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET IT NOW FOR 2 YEARS AND ITS BEEN IMPOSSIBLE SO FAR. IF ANY ONE CAN HELP PLEASE FEEL FREE TO EMAIL ME AT MY95GRADY@AOL.COM THANK YOU
3,"Cultural time piece, otherwise corny","When I was 13 I loved this movie; I'm not 13 anymore.Yet even when I was 13, it didn't make a lot of sense to me. What kind of race were they in? Were they trying to do more tricks, go faster, etc? It was sort of a weird combo freestyle/racing course that does not really exist (or it did not then) in ""professional"" BMXing. It was clearly an attempt to hybrid these two distinct BMX bike disciplines. But would you combine soccer and football to make a movie? Or cricket and baseball?Not only that, the story is just plain corny - probably like many movies of its time and genre. I will agree that for those interested in that biking, it was a fun film.Above all, the opening and closing credits - real freestyling, is fantastic with catchy music. I would happily watch it even now.It's too bad this DVD is not currently available; it's a good timepiece and trip down memory lane."
3,Christmas Gift,"My husband had been looking around for this DVD for a while, and wanted it for Christmas. I took the chance on ordering it through amazon.We have yet to view it, so I can't comment on the quality of the item"
3,RAD,"This is the ultimate bmx movie,in my opinion it helped put it on the map!It's a classic 80's movies.I am surprised it's not on dvd yet.RAD was my favorite movie growing up and still is!Every time I think about RAD the first thing that comes to mind is CRU doing a back flip. Back then it had to be the best trick anybody could do hands down."
5,RAD,"Rad is Rad! This movie has to be one of the greatest films to come out of the last century. If you were a kid in 1986, you saw this movie. You saw it alot. Because everyone who was a kid in 1986 rented Rad everytime your babysitter took you to the videostore. Rad is the best!"
3,Rad,My kids love this! They watched it as young kids and still enjoy it as adults! I would recommend it to anyone interested in bike tricks.
4,Great flick but......,"This is, of course, one of the greatest movies ever. I taped it off of HBO a long time ago but I am still looking for a main part. I can't seem to find the soundtrack anywhere. Any body who has seen it enough times knows why I want the music."
1,Don't order from this company,"It's been over a month and I have yet to receive any sort of confirmation, let alone the actual dvd I ordered that was supposed to be delivered 2 weeks ago. Do not order anything from this seller."
1,Rip off! Movie was a burned copy and no case!,Received the product quickly. Was disappointed to see it was a burned copy of the movie and it didn't come with the case. No where in the ad did I see it was a copy.For condition it said new. Didn't think new would be and illegally burned copy with no case! This is my first and last purchase from Kingbee Legos.
5,Cannot survive without RAD on DVD,"As a BMX Extremist, I have always valued how this film portrayed the BMX lifestyle. It has inspired me to fulfill my hopes and dreams of becoming a more experienced rider. I feel that this film should not be limited to VHS, primarily because DVD is so sophisticated and would allow the average viewer to understand the BMX lifestyle a little more. Bringing this film back onto the market would be beneficial for both the distributer and the consumer.P.S. Make it on DVD already for the love of BMX!!"
1,no good,product was bought and paid for on november 21. on november 23 i received an email that product was shipped. the estimated win dow for delivery was november 24-december 14. i contacted seller three times through email to which i didnt get any responses. also never received the product. i have since filed an a-z claim against seller.
5,The ONLY BMX Film !!!!!!!!!,I agree with everything that everyone has said in these reviews !!! However I'll go one further....When you do release it on DVD....PLEASE make it WIDESCREEN !!!! Full Screen SUCKS !!!! You miss half on the picture !!!!
5,This Movie is Numero Uno,"Watching Rad is like a dream. I recently decided to devote my life to to spreading the truth. The truth of Rad. In the beginning there was one word. The word was Rad. I don't know where I would be today if it were not for this film. When I was younger I tried to emulate the movie and tried a backflip on the ""Helltrack"" we built in my backyard. I've been in a wheelchair is not all bad, nothing is going to stop me from riding halfpipes and stuff. If you can get your hands on a copy of Rad, buy it, love it, cherish it, make sweet love to it. If your local rental store has a copy, I suggest you check it out and then STEAL it. Not since Citizen Kane has there been such a brilliant film. Innovative camera and tracking techniques that revolutionized the film industry can be found only in this film. Move over Mel, this is the Passion of Rad."
1,Rad Racing,"This package never arrived , And it's been 6 weeks ,I will never buy from this seller again......."
4,RAD DVD please!!,Please!!! Will someone please release this on DVD! I've been waiting for this forever and all I can find are cheap bootlegs that play but not well! If I had a VHS player I would buy this here but I don't so I won't. Props to the company for providing the VHS though!
5,THE BEST MOVIE EVER,"This movie is my favorite of all time. No matter how many times I watch it I still get the same feeling. I think all fans of this movie will agree with me that its combination of music, stunts, and acting make it an underated classic. I remember I started renting it when I was about 10 years old. I am 22 now and unfortunately have not seen the movie in about 7 years. It would be great if they can make it for dvd. Even though I know the movie word for word, from begining to end, I still want to own it because its the best movie ever. My favorite scenes were the qualifying for hell track and the bicycle boogie in the gym. I also loved the part at the end of the movie where Bart Taylor was in first place in the hell track race, but he waited for Cru to prove to every one that he was the best. That took a lot of guts."
5,Rad,Rad is one of the best movies of the 80's. If you haven't seen this movie you have to get it. I absolutely love this movie and looked for it everywhere before I was able to finally purchase it and definately recommend you all buy this.
5,RAD!!!!!!,every home in america should have a copy...my favorite movie(i used to ride bmx). i LOVE it
1,Ripped off,I never received my DVD and was charged for it...Be careful when you order from Fishers Favorites. Becky
2,VERY SMALL!!!,The ornaments are very small and the close of picture is kind of miss leading. I wouldn't buy again to small for the price.
3,Battery eater,Easy to use; photos are rather large for emailing; does not like freezing weather; uses up batteries very quickly; would not recommend for someone who takes a lot of photos like we do. Often when the batteries are low it emits a strange squeal and blows out the last picture taken.
4,A Little Different,"This one is a little different, because of what happens to his latest client. But it seems to fit. This was a good story, and Spenser's descriptions and reactions to Los Angeles and Hollywood are priceless. The ending was pretty unrealistic though."
1,real disappointment,"I sometimes like an easy evening reading the latest Stone Barrington series book. This one started out with some interesting dynamics....spies who may or may not be traitors...sleeper agents headed to LA and a presidential negotiation.The ending, however, seemed slapped together, predictable, and I imagined an editor barking, ""Listen, you've got til tomorrow to get this on my desk."" A good tension-building P.I. novel can't rely on clues and discoveries that are simply too coincidental or unrealistic. This one does. Skip it."
3,"Good Story, Lousy Editing","I enjoyed the story, a typical Spencer plot. However, the number of typographical errors (incorrect words, spelling, etc.) made the book frustrating to read."
4,SPENSER EIGHTH BOOK,"The eighth book in the Spenser series is THE SAVAGE PLACE and it takes place in Los Angeles. Spenser is hired to be the body guard for Candy Sloan, investigative reporter for a major television station. Committed to Susan Silverman, Spenser is still attractive to the beautiful Sloan. Good plot twists and the usual great, witty dialogue that are normal for Parker's series make the book enjoyable to read. RECOMMENDED"
3,"Easy, Fun ,Read","Spenser is hired by a California television jopurlnalist to protect her while she investigates mob involvment in the film industry. Spenser is very funny as usual. The plot is fast moving and the story is a little over 180 pages.The tv journalist wants to be taken seriously but, she doesn't hestitant to use sex to get what she wants. The story is told in such a light hearted way that the ending loses alot of its poignancy.Parker understands the people in his novels, but something gets lost."
2,Needs an editor,The kindle edition looks like it was scanned in from hardcopy using a very poor OCR program. This edition is littered with missing punctuation and obvious scan errors. For instance 'clap' became 'dap'. I spent more time trying to figure out the mystery words and sentences then the story itself. You would think that the price charged would mean somebody actually read this edition -- obviously not Dell's concern. Recommendation: avoid kindle books from Dell written prior to 2011.
4,Vintage Parker,"Like: Usual detailed descriptions of 'what he/she' are wearing. Spenser's dialogue rhythmic. Easy reading. Uncomplicated, fast and fun. Spenser and his Susan Silverman are a great pair."
4,manga tech 2 review,"im new to the manga drawing world and this book did help quite a bit. i probably would have been better off if i had gotten volume 1 to start with, but this one was super cheap and i couldnt pass that down. for the price its a worthy book, it covers different types of drawing along with different coloring techniques. i would recommend this book, but not for someone whos a beginner in drawing in general."
5,The best!,"Wish I had 6 more, one for every day of the week. Use it for running and hiking. Bought another one. It was the winter one. It's great too. Don't know what I did before I got one of these. If you sweat or need to keep you head, or in my case, neck warm get one."
5,"""Not Chess Mr. Spock ....Poker.""",Spoiler Space......for those who want to be surprised at the outcome of this episode....I wish the the relationship between Rand and Kirk lasted in this early entry of the series. It would have been more realistic to have Kirk grapple with his feelings for Rand and keeping an objective view of his crewmembers.Kirk bluffs his way out of this one with the mutual destruction device called Corbomite. His crew was doomed and having nothing to lose made up this idea of a self destruct device that would take out both the attacker and the victim.
3,The first real episode,"After two pilot episodes, here is the first real episode of the Star Trek series. All the familiar elements are here (although Uhura wears a gold uniform instead of what would later become her familiar, red one). Sulu's at the helm, McCoy's in sick bay, and Uhura's opening hailing frequencies like only she can.Kirk is in rare form here. In STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN, it is taken for granted that Kirk is a miracle-worker who refuses to admit defeat no matter how dire the circumstances. This episode goes a long, long way towards developing that part of Kirk's character. This is Kirk at the top of his game and it's a lot of fun to watch.A tremendous amount of tension is effectively built in the episode as Kirk tries to think his way out of a no-win scenario and the story approaches its climax. Unfortunately, that tension is inexcusably tossed aside in favor of a cute ending that is too eager to wrap everything up in the allowed time."
3,This episode gets a B- grade and is ranked 42nd out of 80,"While exploring an uncharted region of space, the U.S.S. Enterprise comes upon an alien space buoy which is cube-shaped and spins, warning ships away and blocking the starship's path. Kirk's orders the phasers to destroy the buoy but immediately an alien's ship, the I.S.S. Fesarius, shaped like a large, glowing crystal traps the starship. A ghostly, almost skeletal face appears on the viewscreen, identifying itself as Balok. He tells Kirk that the U.S.S. Enterprise has trespassed and committed hostile actions, and therefore, must be destroyed. Employing a trick from the Earth game, poker, Kirk tries a desperate bluff by convincing Balok that if the U.S.S. Enterprise is fired upon, the corbomite in the starship's hull will self-destruct and destroy both ships."
1,not enough information for this book.,"Amazon doesnt publish enough information for this book. Therefore, I bought the book which is not appropriate my level."
1,Do not buy this item,"This fireplace screen is a piece of crap. I bought it and it fell apart in a week. One by one the screws came out, the trim pieces fell off and it just came apart. Dont throw your money out the window on this item. And if you do buy it keep the box and receipt, if I did I would have returned it.I give this item 0 stars"
2,"Not much of the substance, a lot of fluff","It seems like those, who do not know, how the structure works, how to distribute the bldg program functionally, and how to merge both of them efficiently, have their book too, but graphically excellent on beautiful paper using very good printing technology and dyes. Some of the visions can be viewed after being retrieved using any of the Internet's search engines - looking with the keywords ""Neil Spiller"" for images - to give an idea about the content difficult to describe in words.PS. Not good even for students, who want to learn the substance, but only for those, who do not."
4,Making the music happen,"When first viewed, the program seems a bit hard-to-swallow due to all the stuff you have in front of you on the screen. After I spent a couple of hours figuring out where everything was I was set to start making some beats. WOW! After converting the files into a .wav file and burning the music onto a CD I was amazed that I had created a toe-tapping, head-bobbing mix with a few clicks of my mouse. If you are a drummer, like me, you will have to take a second and visualize the beats in your head and plan them out. But, once you hit your groove, you will be in for a treat. The program is a bit unforgiving: if you make a mistake it might take you a while to get out of it. So saving regularly is a must."
3,"Great show, misleading/poor extras","The show is great, no complaints there. I am however surprised that no one has mentioned anything about how poor the extras are.There are no foreign language tracks despite warnings in French. Why bother when there is no French language track. No big deal as I don't speak French, I just found that odd. The few ""extras"" I did check out turned out to be nothing more than advertizements for other TV show DVDs.The worst part is that the back of packaging says that there is closed captioning. When attempting to view the captions all I get is an error saying ""No captions recorded"". There are no options in the DVD menu for turning on closed captions either. I do not know if this is an error on the part of my DVD player (which displays captions for every other DVD I own), or they simply forgot to put the captions on. Am I the only one that the captions don't work for, or am I the first to notice?5 stars for the show-2 stars for the DVD extras/presentations"
4,good,"i was hoping for the box to come with the product, but it did not. that is fine though. not that big of a deal. got to my house fast which was nice."
5,IT STINKS!!,"just kidding, i loved this show. this show was one of the first fox prime time cartoons to get cancelled in it's prime. john lovitz is so funny and it's the kind of series you can watch all the way through again and again. if you liked the clerks cartoon, you'll love this"
3,The critic,OMG i have loved this SHOW SINCE I WAS LITTLE!!! i ordered it used and it was sent looking so new!!!! I know any one that has this will be very happy!!! :) enjoy
4,Ask yourself something,"I liked this show a lot. But I need to ask someone in marketing: what's the idea of having the cover of this DVD proclaim ""It stinks!"" Did you think of the sales of this item would be increased by this?Anyway, the show was good, but it rambled a bit. Overall, it perhaps was not as grounded as the Simpsons are in reality, but it had its moments. It could have done with more parodies of movies.And my copy did not have close captioning or subtitles."
4,And now we want Duckman,"Amazon asked for comments on this show but everything has already been said by the 60 plus people who have reviewed it already. Just shows you how (most) people loved this programme. I wouldn't miss an episode when it was first shown and was sad that it only had a short run. The world weary TV film critic with his eccentric family and friends was an original and stylish concept. Would it now look dated? Not a bit - the characterisations are as sharp as ever and the movie pastiches spot on. It's great to have all the episodes together in this well packaged set; good extras, too. More importantly it still very funny.This joins ""The Simpsons"" and ""Ren and Stimpy"" in my all time classic TV cartoon series collection. Now how about releasing ""Duckman"" on DVD?"
3,It (sorta) stinks!,"As funny as this show was in its day, it seems kind of lame compared to today's animated shows. Don't get me wrong, though, it's still offers a few laughs on occasion."
3,"An enjoyable collection for fans, but won't win over anyone new.","Back in the 90's I really enjoyed The Critic when it was on ABC, Fox, and eventually in reruns on Comedy Central. So when I got the DVD collection I was thrilled to finally watch it again after all these years. The show itself is very dated - full of pop culture references (obviously with movies being the main source of inspiration). The quality of the episodes sort of depends on how heavily the writing leaned on those references and whether or not those movies are still considered good today.Personally I love it. Most of the episodes anyway. There's a few that were bad back then, that have only gotten worse 20 years later. But I also have the nostalgia factor that helps me enjoy it. My wife who never saw a single episode during the original airings could barely make it through a single episode. So if you're a fan of the show, go ahead and get this. If you weren't, you're probably better off just avoiding it."
5,"Favorite TV series, a classic.","I have never been as entertained with any other animated TV series as I am while watching the Critic. And that means a lot, coming from someone who is a devoted fan of the Simpsons. Knowing that this show was produced by the same producer as the Simpsons, I gave it a try and haven't been more pleased. Jon Lovitz is brilliantly depicted as a cartoon as a short, chubby, (gay?) film critic, who gives us his take on movies that just plain stink. The other voices are perfect for the characters of Jay's son Marty, his father Franklin/mother Eleanor, boss Duke, stylist Doris and of course all of the imitated actors. The humor is quirky, the plots are pointless yet wonderful and if you're looking for something a little different from the average TV cartoon, pop in the Critic and you're sure to be pleased."
3,Just As Funny As I Remember,The Critic was always one of my favorite animated tv shows. I hadn't seen episodes of this show since it went off the air. Watching these disks brought back so many memories and I laughed at all episodes especially some forgotten. I'm glad I purchased The Critic!
4,the master of the cut-away gag!,"The Simpsons invented it, and The Critic ran with it! (And then Family Guy kinda stole and it seems to be the basis of all their good jokes) The Critic was an absolute gem of a show. John Lovitz at his best and for all you simpsons/futurama fans its a must! Alot of the writers and directors of futurama worked on the critic and it shows, with the critic being a great mix of good comedy writing and far out nonsense. ""Aw c'mon Jay, the bear feels bad for what he did, he wants to do a little dance for you"". Great show at great value too!"
2,Not that great,"I'm surprised at all the high ratings; the show is just not that funny. Jon Lovitz becomes annoying fairly quickly, and the characters have no depth."
4,It Zings!,"...a lot of hot topics of the day, actors, politicians and more. It was a fun show and the humor very clever. (maybe too clever for some viewers) The fact that it was so topical and talked about current event may be one of the reasons it failed.Fans of The Simpson, The Family Guy, King of the Hill and Futurama should really enjoy this series. I can't say I like it as much as the aformentioned, but I liked it enough. There are too few good ""adult"" oriented cartoons on TV today, it is a shame this one never found it's nitch. Those of you who like clever comedy and great celebrity impersonations should enjoy The Critic."
5,Scrapbook Kit,This was a Christmas present for my niece. She is really into crafting right now and she was so excited to receive this scrapbook kit. She just couldn't wait to start getting into it.
4,Creativity For Kids It's My Life Scrapbook Kit,"I think it's different from other toys I'veseen so far.The kids gets to create-tellstories of art or put photos of their frie-nds and family.Then, they send to theOriginator, and returns back to them bymail.T. M."
4,present,"this is a christmas present, so it was not opened yet, but looking at the box it is exactly what i expected. came in a timley manner. would use this seller again."
4,Scrapbook Kit,"My niece loved it and finished it in a day. I thought that was fast, but her mom said no....the girls love doing it and spent the entire day working on their pages."
4,daughter loved it,"i got this for my daughter for christmas and she loved it. the only crappy thing on my part is that i found the exact thing on ebay brand new for half of the price that i paid here for it, but thats my fault for not looking first there. but like i said she loved it."
3,Not that great,Not much variety or creativeness for the price. I went to Walmart and got one between 10 to 12 bucks and it had more pages and accessories included.
4,Truly a collection of their best works.,"Everybody likes at least one DS song, be it ""Walk of Life"", ""Money for Nothing"" or ""Telegraph Road"". All of these songs are here, as well as some of their other all-time greats. If you're a fan, you'll love it, and if you're not, you'll soon love it. Deserves a place in everybody's CD collection."
3,Mostly good,"Great songs for the most part. It contains the edited version of MONEY FOR NOTHING. So that sucks. I loved that they used the live versions of TELEGRAPH ROAD and PORTOBELLO BELLE. They should have left off PRIVATE INVESTIGATIONS and WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING, and replaced them with SIX BLADE KNIFE, WATER OF LOVE, ANGEL OF MERCY, WILD WEST END or any number of songs. i also think restricting a DIRE STRAITS GREATEST HITS to a mere twelve songs does the band and their fans a severe dis service. CREDENCE's greatest hits album, CHRONICLE had twenty songs on it and DIRE STRAITS had a much longer recording career."
1,WHAT THE HELL???,"Nowhere in your description did you mention the album was edited. After first listen, I noticed that Money For Nothing has a whole verse cut out, even though the lyrics for that verse are in the liner notes. What is this, some sort of sanitized version? False advertising....not happy at all. How do I return it?"
3,a let down,"I bought this CD after hearing Ari Hest live. I had never heard of him before then. As much as I loved him in concert, this disc is a disappointment. It sounds like slick, standard produced radio pop. On stage, there was energy and excitement. I'm sure his old independent stuff has to be better."
4,You have to give this a listen!,"I was playing around on Awarestore.com and came across Ari Hest and immediately fell in love with his music. There is so much spirit in his music and you can tell that he loves what he is doing! This album is amazing Fascinate You is one of those fun songs that you'll know every word to whether or not you want to and when you do, you won't be able to not sing along! Check out www.arihest.com!"
2,"Not horrible, but nothing new either","Someone gave me this CD to check out. Usually if I like one I'll buy it or rip the best trax, but I honestly didn't find one single track worth keeping. He sings ok and the songs sound ok, but they also sound old, or like they were from the 1990s. I def wouldn't buy this with my own money. I think all these 5 star reviews were mostly on the same day from the same person or his record company making him look good.Just my thoughts, sorry if you disagree but at least I'm honest.bye 4 now,Josh"
1,Guess I'm Not Alone,"Seems that others are feeling the same way about this CD. It doesn't do much for me either. I don't want to be mean, but the person who said that Ari Hest looks like a guy who sells phone cards at the mall got it right. I have to agree. But I guess we're supposed to review his CD. Well, I have just finished listening to it for the second time and it's not any better. There's not much here but yet another John Mayer type who isn't as good a songwriter and not even close to the same caliber of singer. How this guy got to make a CD is anyone's guess, but just because he did doesn't mean it's any good. Believe me, it's not. All I can guess is that all the 5 star reviews on here are from his own fan club or street team because I can't believe that anyone would give this 5 stars. I would've given it zero stars but that is not an option on amazon."
1,HORRIBLE ALBUM!!!!!!!!!,What a waste of money! Ordered it online and am terribly disappointed. Horrible!!
5,"Amazing talent, great unique voice","I think this is one of the best singer/songwriters I have heard in years. Wise beyond his years, his music is soulful, haunting and envigorating. I hope everyone gets a chance to experience and enjoy this young talent. He is a career artist and I look forward to enjoying his music for years to come."
3,"Ari Hest is GREAT, but this CD doesn't prove it....","I'm giving this album a three because I don't want his ratings to go down far and have people thinking he stinks. Ari is AWESOME, but this CD sure isn't.If you're in the mood to hear some of his best stuff get a copy of ""Story after Story""... Ari built up an entire fan base on his own by singing what came from the heart and recording it as he saw fit. His voice is mesmerizing, and he really did know how to show it off best.I was so excited about him being recognized, but I'm not excited about the overproduction of music. Many of the repeated songs on this album can't compare to the original. Check out his website and get his old stuff, you will NOT be disapointed!!"
5,DVD movie Great,movies works good it played good wish I would of got full screen but I order what I order movie is great how I remembered it a oldy but a goody
2,"Good Movie, Sloppy Delivery","Was disappinted in the delivery of the DVD. Case was broken so the DVD was loose. It skips in two spots, doesn't distract from the movie, but it is annoying."
3,Convoy is a great 70's movie,"It is unfortunate this movie is unavailable. I agree the movie is not a great work of film art, but it is a great lazy afternoon film. I was young when the film was released so it has become part of my childhood. Like Starsky and Hutch and The Dukes of Hazard, when watched as an adult you laugh, but it still brings back fun memories. Convoy represents the 70's and the way we thought at the time. A great truck driving movie about standing for your beliefs no matter what the cost. How can you argue with that? And lets not forget that you can purchase Saturday Night Fever on DVD... Talk about a stupid movie. If you want to call a movie bad lets be happy most people forgot about Xanadu!"
2,Good flick - Horrible transfer,"This is the first time I've run into a to-DVD transfer that is so horrible that I feel I need to add to the reviews. If it wasn't for the movie, it'd get 0 stars. Aspect ratio is off (thank you PowerDVD for allowing me to fix that), sound level is low (need to turn volume up to max) and sound quality not much better. Picture quality fairly fuzzy. Don't waste your money."
2,Quality issues!,"Got this Kinowelt version today (11-19-08). It appears to be a bootleg. The case label is a scanned copy, the DVD label is a copy with a very obvious scanned moire pattern from the lithographic dot structure of the original, the DVD itself is a recordable DVD. Playing it, the image quality is mediocre at best. Lots of jaggies on lines, noisy image quality. But the biggest problem is, the audio is in the Left channel only! There is very faint, almost non-existent, audio in the Right channel. Wonder where the quality control was on this? And what's the deal being on a recordable DVD?!"
3,Convoy,"Not what I remembered it to be. Has lots of sexual hints and vulgarity, crude and wouldn't recommend at all for young children."
1,wrong data,"I purchased this video for my father not knowing that it wasn't from amazon.com itself, bu from a private vendor. Now I face the challenge of returning it before christmas and there is no information on the invoice that was sent to me in regards to returns."
1,The Lost Order,I really could not tell you how the film really is since .I never recieved it from the seller.I look forword to one day to watch the movie that me and my dad watch at a drive in .But what i can remeber i was very good .
2,vhs shrunk to dvd,this video is chopped alot of scenes are cut. the screen is shrunk to make it widescreen. poor quality looks like a 5 year old did this. I blame cheezy fliks. their making money on a sub standard movie. I like the movie itself just not the chopped and squat version.the audio is lame even on surround sound. from what I've seen this is the only dvd around. too bad I would not recommend this to anyone who has seen it on tv you will be let down.
2,poor picture quality,"Sam Peckinpah is one of my favorite film director. So I expected this DVD. But, this picture quality is awfully disappointing. How poor is the quality of this DVD ? In comparison with taht when I wached this film on TV meny years ago, it was better than this DVD. What a DVD!"
1,"Nice New Cover, Same Crappy Cheezy Flicks DVD","Don't be fooled! While they have updated the cover art for this film this is nothing more than the same crappy Cheezy Flicks DVD with horrible video and audio, missing scenes included... If your looking for quality and a complete version get the Kinowelt / Truckerflicks version, it has digitally remastered video and audio as well as the missing footage cut out of the other Convoy releases, the only drawback is the back of the DVD cover is in German but the movie and everything else is in English... Far worth the extra bucks. Avoid the Cheezy - Cheezy Flicks stuff like the plague!"
3,convoy EU edition,"as a Peckinpah fan i bought convoy many years ago on vhs , i must have seen it a 100 times , when dvd came out one of the first movies i bought was offcourse convoy, it was distributed by a very fage company called video film express, allthough the picture and sound quality was quite good a piece of the puzzle was missing. the largest part of the interviews done by a reporter driving next to the convoy was missing, a few months ago Universal/studio canal released it again ,so i bought this dvd aswel but again the reporter part was missing, i guess you could say i was very dissapointed,i mean there must be a complete print out there somewhere that the studio bosses can put on dvd for the true movie lovers"
1,Don't buy the defective DVD release,"I like the movie, but the maker of the edition I ordered, Pacific Family entertainment, stretched the picture to make a full-screen presentation of a widescreen film. I wrote them twice, they refused to respond. I'm also disappointed that Amazon.com put their name on it -- apparently they don't screen their partners very carefully; this is the second time I trusted them and found they don't back products they sell. Buyer beware!"
5,Awsome movie,This has always been a great movie. I would recommend this movie to my friends. It is a good movie to eat popcorn to while watching the movie.
5,Great movie,came a day earlier than expected.. absolutely love the movie and I was so happy to finally be able to find it.
2,"DISAPPOINTED AGAIN,","The movie was the one I wanted, however, It was supposed to be ""new"" I guess ""new"" means different things to different people. I didnt order from ""cheesey Flicks because of the reviews, I ordered from Amazon (I wont ever again, though) and it still came from ""Cheesey Flicks"". The picture was not ""clear like it should be, it was a very poor ""digital remaster"" the sound track was off, it was like watching the old jaspanese monster movies, where the lips were moving, but not in sync with the soundtrack, You had to keep your finger on the volume button on the remote cause the sound went up and down...I was really disappointed, I have learned my lesson, ""again"" hope against hope, that I would get a fair deal when buying off the internet,.... what you see, isn't always what you get...."
5,Still Truckin',"This is still a favorite among family as my uncle is a trucker and we first watched it with him as kids. Great movie, glad to find the DVD. Very much worth it."
4,reviewing conoy dvd purchase,"have not had a chance to watch the dvd as of yet , but i've always liked the movie because it came out when i was younger . in the time the cb radio was popular . so it will be a nice addition to my dvd collection ."
2,Very disappointed.,The sound and picture quality of this film is terrible! It looks like someone aimed a video camera at a tv screen running the movie and taped it. Will not order from this seller again.
3,New DVD release??,"I recently watched ""Convoy"" on the new MGM HD Channel on DirecTv. It was presented uncut, commercial free and in it's correct aspect ratio (2.35:1)The picture looked clean (remastered)and the sound was very good, 5.1 I believe. It looks as though MGM may have the video rights to this title and as such may re-release it on dvd. If so I hope they release it with some extras."
2,PFE releases a poor DVD,I actually upset to learn neither MGM/UA or Warner Bros released this movie to DVD. They give distribution licencing rights to two companies and don't even give/produce the FULL version of 106 Min. I would'nt mind any company releasing Convoy to DVD but at least show all 106 min and include the trailer. Everyone that has begged (including me) for this movie to be released on DVD got completely ripped off. It was not digitally enhanced and this has to be the first DVD literally in history to not hagve a movie's full version.We should have just purchased DVD recorders and dubbed it from the Thorn EMI VHS release. Hell even television shows the entire movie excluding language.
1,Cheesy Movie,This is a good movie wrecked by a crap presentation. Don't buy it. Amazon should withdraw it.
4,un-plug your mind and enjoy the ride,"I saw this movie at the theater when it first came out. Look, folks....it's not high art, but who cares? Kris Kristofferson is always fun to watch. The man can flat act and it's entertaining just listening to him speak. The story is improbably at best, but again....who cares? This is a movie to watch on a day when you just don't feel like thinking. You just put the disc in the player, lay back, un-plug your brain and enjoy the ride. It's very entertaining and it throws a nice punch at the corruption that many of us native southerners have seen for ourselves in some small town sheriffs. All in all it's an entertaining movie with an outstanding soundtrack. Movies like this don't win Oscars, but they do entertain. And isn't that what we want?"
2,GREAT MOVIE-BAD DVD,"All Convoy fans beware-Buy the cheaper version DVD that AMAZON offers and pass the expensive one up. I got so excited after my three week wait when my new DIGITALLY REMASTERED VERSION of this great movie showed up. I immediatly put it into my DVD player and what do I see after I push play? A very [bad] picture with the sound to match. The picture is bearable but the static you here through the whole movie is not. I just spent [money] on a DVD that sounds worse than some of my dusty, old records ... To some it up, awesome trucking movie, definatly add it to your collection-especially if you like good ol' 70's flicks. Just don't buy the SO CALLED DIGITALLY REMASTERED VERSION! RATED PG-BRIEF STRONG LANGUAGE, VIOLENCE, BRIEF NUDITY AND PLENTY OF DESTRUCTION! THIS MOVIE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE RECEIVED A PG-13 RATING IN TODAYS STANDARDS."
2,"Great movie, poor quality dvd","I love a good '70s cb radio movie as much as the next person and I really love this movie. However, this dvd is of very poor quality-it looks like it was taped off an old tv set and the sound is not synched with the picture. I couldn't watch it. It was put out by a company called Cheezy Flicks. I won't be buying anything else they put out. Let's hope some other company does a professional job of transferring this fun movie onto a dvd...how hard could it really be???"
1,CONVOY by cheazy flicks,I just bought this item. This is a great movie itself but whatever cheazyflicks did to it is sad. I can't even watch the movie because after 20 minutes the picture gets all disturted and starts pausing and the sound also freezes and is distorted. The movie itself is great buy the VHS version and you'll be better off.
3,Good news and bad news,"The good news is that CONVOY is on DVD in widescreen. The bad news is that its running time is trimmed. On my VHS, it clocks in at 106 min. Amazon.com lists it as 110 min, the DVD case says 111 min. The actual running time is 103 min--3 min less than my VHS. For a Peckinpah movie, 3 minutes are important. You can guess where seconds were snipped."
2,convoy,we are collecters of old classic. This movie is a great one to have in our collection. somthing different. alway great to see young faces on old actors
4,A perfect piece of 1970s nostalgia,"This is a review of the 30th anniversary widescreen edition of ""Convoy,"" which is in perfectly good shape (regarding picture quality, etc.). As for the movie itself: If you're fond of that 1970s CB radio craze (immortalized by ""Smokey and the Bandit"" and, of course, this movie's title song), ""Convoy"" is a pleasure to watch. Directed by Sam Peckinpah, it's not exactly your typical Peckinpah film while at the same time being a bit edgier than SATB (for one thing, Ernest Borgnine's lawman is much more sinister than Jackie Gleason's). Above all, though, this movie is worth seeing for the amazing stunt work. Yes, kids, ""Convoy"" predates CGI, which means those are real people in real trucks doing real stunts. As a spectacular sample of a lost art, ""Convoy"" belongs in anyone's DVD library."
1,cheesy but love it....,"I bought the film as the memory of the music from when I was a kid has stayed with me for 30 + years. Love it, so cheesy but it is a great movie for a laugh night. I really enjoyed it..."
2,Late Arival,Ordered two of them in plenty of time before Christmas to give as gifts to my Trucker sons. They arrived the day AFTER Christmas!!
5,Convoy,"I bought the VHS version of the movie going off the other reviews listed.I received it yesterday and watched it twice.The quality is excellent.No fuzzy picture or sound.If you want a copy of this old classic movie,get one on video."
4,Disney Princess Snow White,I have seen a doll like this one and wanted it for my grandchild who loves it. Quality okay but material not very cuddly.
3,Pretty Good,It smells good & as previously mentioned it draws dirt from your pores. However it does hurt when intially pulling the masque off. It worked pretty good for a few dollars.
1,Lubridurm,The product in the photos does not match what was sent. The photo shows the old discontinued product while the actual product isn't the same. It has a odor to it which the original didn't.If I had known this and not relied on the photo I would never had made the purchase.
3,Fair power supply for the price,"This PSU was one of the pieces I got to do my first DIY upgrade. It got here fast, installed easily and has been doing the job I bought it for for about a month now. It's a little noisier than I was hoping for, but about as quiet as I expected. I think it was a decent choice for the budget range I was operating in."
3,Just Like New,"I ordered it with prime and it did not ship within two business days like they said it would. I called the company and that issue was resolved. So I got the book later than expected, about 4 or 5 days later. The characters are kind of small in the book and there seems to be a lack of structure in the book so far. Hopefully I grow to like the book over the semester. I have no choice but to use this textbook. The only plus is the book was like brand new."
3,Disappointing Album that Improves with Listening,"Wish I'd seen the excellent earlier review before buying. I thought I was getting the ORIGINAL Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald; this remake sounds as though Gordon was bored and just going through the motions. Maybe he'd sung it a few thousand times too many. At any rate, I was initially disappointed, but I listened to the album several times anyway. Guess what? Some of the songs ""grew"" on me. I especially like Pony Man, If It Should Please You, and Christian Island. I still wince when track 6 (Wreck) comes on, but all in all, I'd call it an enjoyable, but not great album."
4,I LOVE it!,"I have been a Lightfoot fan for decades. Since I was a teen in the early days of folk music, this has been the style of music I have loved the most my whole life. I enjoyed the songs I already knew on this album, but when the CD was stolen I re-bought it for the lesser known cuts: High and Dry, and Pony Man. They make my heart sing! Having Christian Island, Alberta Bound and Cherokee Bend there also just make it that much better. I have always prefered studio versions to live. I am sure there are others who agree!"
2,GORD AND A $35 CASIO KEYBOARD,"This is one of the very few times I rip into my favorite songwriter, and I'll tell you why: Outside of the opening song IF IT SHOULD PLEASE YOU, this album is nothing but Gordon Lightfoot lifelessly singing in a studio as someone pounds out simple 1-2-3-4 chords on a keyboard.I can't tell you how disappointed I was when I got past the opening track (which is what saved me from knocking this album to a one-star clunker). Now I can not stress to you, the reader how much I deeply enjoy EVERY ONE of Gordon Lightfoot's albums, but this really was an embarrassment to his career. I'm not kidding when I say that voice aside, Tommy Smothers could have pulled this album off with the same emotional intensity and talent put in.DON'T BUY THIS! Download the first song IF IT SHOULD PLEASE YOU, then don't let this album taint the beautiful visual lyrics, instrumentation, voice, and feeling that the original versions possess."
1,Huge disappointment,"This album is absolutely horrible. These are not the original releases of these songs. These are all atrocious recordings made in 1988.Gordon Lightfoot mumbles his way through this whole album, at times sounding disturbingly like the Swedish Chef from the old Muppets TV show. Even the new version of the Wreck of The Edmund Fitzgerald is unbearable listening. It's hard to believe that somebody at the record company actually allowed this album to be released."
1,Huge Disappointmenet,"I, like most other reviewers here have Greatest hits Volume 1 and looked forward to volume 2. I listened to it once and put it aside. I didn't realize at the time that most of the songs had been rerecorded. The new recordings are flat and Gordon's voice sounds strained and weak."
2,What Gord's Gold means to me,"When I was in Junior High School I spent a lot of time in the resource room. The resource room was the place where kids with minor learning disabilities went to get help with school work. None of us wanted to be there so we had an incentive plan in which we could earn points for positive behavior and completion of our school work. The prizes were not very motivating-a few small toys, some candy, a comb and a tape of Gord's Gold 2.It was in that room that I understood the futility of life. you work hard, complete assignments, you overcome your modest but real learning disabilities and what's your reward? a copy of Gord's Gold 2. A mule that won't budge gets a carrot dangled in front of his face, a mouse in a maze gets a piece of cheese at the end but we got a shot at winning Gord's Gold 2. This is what Gord's Gold 2 means to me."
1,Wreck of Gord's Gold II,"Well, I bought the tape ""Gord's Gold II"" for the song ""wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald"" and discovered as someone else did who reviewed the album found it to be an alternate version of the song which left me disappointed and glad I didnt soak more money into the cd. Now I like Gordon Lightfoot, but there is alot of music on this effort of his that I just dont recognize. Give me a Greatest hits comp with ""sundown"", ""carefree highway"", ""wreck"" and the like and we could talk. Like most here hough, I have to give a thumbs down. I give this cd 1 star and it hurts to do that."
2,Gordon at his worst,"Although many highlights of his 80's albums are in their original versions and has a great song called ""If It Should Please You"" available nowhere else, everything else, including ""Wreck of The Edmund Fitzgerald"" is all re-recorded and the remakes are not good at that. You are better off getting the ""Songbook"" boxed set or the original albums for what you would be buying this for. If It weren't for the highlights of the 80's albums and the new track, this would rate 1 star, but since the 1980's original recordings are well chosen and ""If It Should Please You"" is a decent song, I give it 2 stars."
2,Boring,"I, too, loved Vol 1. On this album it sounds like the band is asleep. It's so uninspired that I threw it out. I didn't see a warning on the packaging that he'd rerecorded the songs... I wish I'd had the web then."
2,"Boring, rehashed songs","Gord's Gold Vol 1 is one of my favorite CD's, so I had high expectations for Vol 2. The majority of songs have been redone, losing a lot in the process. I was highly disappointed. 2 stars only because I have heard worse! (Not by Gordon, though!)"
1,Should have had original studio cuts,"The purpose of buying a greatest hits collection is to get a representative assortment of songs without having to buy a large quantity of CDs. On an album entitled Gord's Gold II, we have a right to expect the original studio cuts. A live album should have been released separately. The live versions of High & Dry, All the Lovely Ladies and others just don't make the grade."
2,modest mouse ripoff,"seriously, save your money. this is like weird al making an album of modest mouse and imperial teen ripoffs. except they aren't joking. when i listened to song 3, i thought, there's no way...but they are just totally aping isaac brock's vocal style. why?! if you are in an indie band, why try to steal how someone w/ a distinctive voice (isaac, tim kinsella, etc.) sing? too distracting to enjoy."
2,modest mouse [copy],"seriously, save your money. this is like weird al making an album of modest mouse and imperial teen [parodie]s. except they aren't joking. when i listened to song 3, i thought, there's no way...but they are just totally aping isaac brock's vocal style. why?! if you are in an indie band, why try to [imitate] how someone w/ a distinctive voice (isaac, tim kinsella, etc.) sing? too distracting to enjoy."
5,"Poignant, exciting, a different slant on American history","This book gives the reader a poignant view of American history. It deals with areas that other historians refuse to talk about. This book should be on the ""required reading list"" for all high school and college students."
5,"Angels are Talking, a book that talks to you....","Michele Whitdove's book was recommended by a friend. From the onstart of the book, I could not put it down. It's truly an enlighting experience into the most questioned topic about life after death. She communicates her messages very clearly and precise. There's no room for questioning, ""What did she mean by that"". After reading this book I immediately ordered the other books Michele had written.Angels are Talking gave me insight, energy and created a feeling of peace I have ever felt after reading a book.Thank you Michele, you are truly a messenger."
5,Angels Are Talking,"Soulful, insightful and informative. This book is truly a must read for anyone who has ever questioned life, love and loss. Michelle Whitedove through her powerfully, yet eloquently simplistic writing encourages and challenges all to open our hearts, minds and souls to the universal law of love. She neither endorses nor disparages any religion yet beautifully validates that a God, by whatever name undoubtably exists. Her messages inspires hope and reminds us we are truly never alone, we all have a purpose and death is definitely not an ending."
3,Not as Dante or Swedenborg,"This book is not what I expected: who are angels, What is their origin,what is their religion,what is paradise or hell? No answers to these questions, only some episodes of personal life of those who asked the medium.I suppose that angels as mediums between God and humankind would be glad to inform us about more important things.Not much to learn from this book.I think that the author has connection to only lower level of spiritual entities."
4,The late Bryan MacLean was something else.,"One of the finest things to come out of L.A. in the 60's was Love, led by the crazy genius of Arthur Lee who fully eclipsed bandmate Maclean (who wrote 3 or 4 of Love's finest songs) after Bryan left the band nobody heard from him on record again until this `97 release. Bryan's mom found these tapes of his acoustic song demos and the good folks at Sundazed have allowed them to see the light of day. If you love Love, you need this and even if you've never heard of them, this is really good on its own and it helps to unravel the mystery of one of rock & roll's more interesting M.I.A.'s. (it was Jesus not drugs in Bryan's case) Maclean died on Christmas day in 1998."
1,shows again the whole to be greater than its parts,"I've been a fan of LOVE since introduced to Forever Changes back in 1969. That remains my favorite LOVE album, so I was excited when the news that Bryan Maclean had put out an album began to circulate. After seeking it out in record stores for several years, I finally found it here. My disappointment is profound. Instead of new material, all I found was a weak collection of musical doodlings which would have been better off consigned to the trash bin. There is almost nothing even tolerably listenable on this album. Like Simon and Garfunkel, the team of Lee and MacLean was a much stronger unit together than apart."
4,real music,"The CD arrived four days after my order.Case ,a bit scuffed but disc is in great condition .Quality music and quality sound. Definitly a good buy for the price."
4,Saving negatives,"Years back everyone had negatives and very often they just came in a little paper envelope, Over time, the negatives pile up while the paper holders fall apart. In comes the storage sheet and things are easier to find and stored more safely. Now, people who still shoot film will want these to replace the light weight plastic sleeves they get their negatives back in."
4,Good for storage.,"We're good for storing film. Not a thick as some other brand, but still good. I am happy with it."
4,Nice,Needed for photography college class. Came on time and fit all my negatives in it. Recommend this to all photography majors
4,Good for the money,"I think these negative file binder pages are a good deal given the low price.The pages are made from a fairly thin polyethylene material which is fine for the storage and protection of the negative strips, but will have to be handled carefully so the binder holes don't tear. If you handle your negatives frequently you might want to choose a more robust product. But if you are like me and handle your negatives very infrequently these pages should be fine for you.I am putting my pages in a D-ring binder which does not put as much stress on pages as the traditional circular binder shape, so I think these will work out fine for me."
2,"Do you want to say ""bad words""?","After developing 8 rolls of black and white I needed some negative sleeves to hold my recently processed film.I read a number of great reviews on amazon so I thought these were going to be great and easy to load....Little did I know, upon receiving these I was anxious to get my negatives in them to keep them clean and scratch free.THESE ARE VERY THIN.....EXTREMELY HARD TO LOAD...ONCE THE SHARP CORNER OF THE NEGATIVE PIERCES THE NEGATIVE SLEEVE YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO LOAD THEM.IF YOUR NEGATIVES HAVE ANY SORT OF CURL TO THEM AND DONT SLIDE IN PERFECTLY ON THE FIRST TRY, YOU ARE GOING TO BE SAYING ALL THE BAD WORDS YOU KNOW TRYING TO LOAD THESE.If there is a more expensive version of this sleeve, buy it, do not hesitate.If you are looking for the cheapest option this is it, but you will only get about 60% of your negatives in the sleeve. I will not order again....DO NOT ORDER....save yourself the trouble, hassle and bad words."
4,not too bad!,"This is ok for smaller rolls of film, like 24 exposure. With 36 you are left with an extra frame. Other than that, they are easy to load strips into."
5,Nice product!!,"It is a great product to protect and preserve our 35mm negative films, the only drawback is that only fit on one page 7 strips (5 shots per line) and the negative films are usually 12,24 and 36 exposures."
2,"Flimsy, hard to handle","I bought this item based on glowing reviews, but was very disappointed.PROS:Will just do the job of storing the negatives- with an attitude.CONS:1. The plastic material is very thin and flimsy. It is not easy to handle till you put the negatives in it. I expected some AVERY quality thicker material that can hold itself.2. Because of the cheap quality of the material and NO reinforcements near the 3 holes, it is hard to put and keep them in place in a 3-ring binder. I had to buy strips of reinforcements to keep it secure in place, and prevent it from getting torned.This product needs improvement, and I will not recommend it."
4,Very well put together package of diverse music.,"The Knickerbockers are best known for the Beatles sound alike hit ""Lies"" Unfortunately this track really stands out and over shadows the rest of the collection. Most of the music in this collection is good but lacking in the excitement of ""Lies."" If you know the band and want a good example of what they could do this is the collection you want. It is a well produced quality sound recording. The tracks I was familiar with are the original recordings."
4,If You Want to Know More About Rebecca Harding Davis,"If you want to know more about Rebecca Harding Davis and the way her talent and life were subjugated to her husband's ambitions, read ""Survival by Surrender"" in ""Something More - Excavating Your Authentic Self"" by Sarah Ban Brethnach."
4,"James Bond its not, but that's a good thing.","I went into the book expecting a thrilling spy adventure a la James Bond or Jason Bourne. The Tailor of Panama is none of these things and that is a good thing. Instead of over-the-top action and flashy gadgets you get real people with real problems portrayed in lush detail and with great humanity by Le Carre. The main character Harry Pendal is an average man placed in extraordinary circumstances and he reacts accordingly. The book traces his rise and fall through the world of international espionage. Along the way a host of interesting characters are introduced from playboy British spies to house wives at their wits end. Throughout the novel each is rendered in great detail and help illustrate the range of human emotions. While not a traditional spy novel, The Tailor of Panama deserves a place on your self for its beautiful detail and excellent character studies."
2,Far from his best,"I buy everything Le Carre writes, so I don't feel embarrassed about calling one a clunker. This one is basically a re-make of Graham Greene's ""Our Man in Havana,"" without the humor -- and without acknowledgement. Moreover, I got the audio version, which is read by the author. Large portions of it are incomprehensible; he swallows words, and drops often to a whisper for ""dramatic effect"" -- which doesn't work well when you can't understand what he is saying"
1,A truely forgettable read.,"It would be hard to imagine a worse book. Boring, implausable plot, and endless are only a few of things which this piece of trash bring to mind. Without a doubt the poorest excuse for a book which I've had the misfortune to read in the last few years."
2,I couldn't pick it up,"Forget about putting the book down . . . this book was so tedious that I had trouble motivating myself to keep reading it. The plot and setting develop at a snail's pace, seem to go nowhere for a while, then suddenly wrap up clumsily.The only two characters worthy of our sympathy are inexplicably in love with the annoying protagonist. Greene's version IS better (although also a slow start)."
2,Valium-strength bore coupled with exquisite style,"I am not sure why the publisher refers to this book as a ""thriller"". It is one of the slowest reads I've ever had; no thrills whatsoever! The satire comes in incredibly funny (yet very rare) spurts followed by gaping voids of extreme boredom. The writing, however, is first rate! Mr. Le Carre is a master of the English language, and his elegance of style puts him up there with the best of them. Read this book for the content, and you will regret it; read it for style and you'll adore it"
1,A must avoid !!,"I don't pretend to have the literary skills nor vocabulary of the author but would have thought that he would have realized that he had created a ""stinker"" when it was all done. Had this been his first it would surely not have been printed. The book started to unravel literally after about 10 pages with pages separating from the spine and this should have served as an omen to me. I have wasted many hours giving this book a chance and now that it is nearing the end and still not going anywhere.... Much like one turns off a bad TV show or walks out of a poor, boring movie, I will not finish this tattered disappointment but will throw it out as my time is too valuable to waste on such tripe. The language is vague, the conversations unreal, the situations unlikely....it goes on and on. So utterly painful that it is too bad we are unable to give a rating less than 1 star."
1,The Tailor of Panama is Our Man in Havana,"The Tailor of Panama shows again that Mr. Le Carre lacks the most important quality in a writer of fiction...imagination. It seems that since acquiring fame, Mr. Le Carre has decided not to think too much about plot, but rather copy whatever there is to copy, ad a bit of eccentricity to the characters, and voila. The Tailor of Panama is Our Man in Havana, much like The Perfect Spy is a retelling of Kim Philby's story, a story that has been told many times.I, at least, look for originality in plot and premise. Mr. Le Carre has become a comformist."
4,Le Carre writes about people,"Le Carre does not write primarily about espionage. He certainly does not write about action. Le Carre wries about people, brilliant menageries of people, in-depths about people. Once again he creates a collection of fascinating plodders and oddballs. I did some months in Panama. That was a few years before Operation Just Cause, but somehow the ambiance rings true. One frustration: no map! In the next edition, please include a map."
5,All The Elements Of Good Fiction,"Tailor Of Panama is different from other Le Carre novels, but nevertheless masterfully written. If you are a diehard fan of Le Carre, you'll get it from page one. If not, you should enjoy this superb story-telling all the same."
3,"Begins brilliantly, then unravels","This begins with a brilliant, virtuoso first 100 pages as Osnard meets the eponymous tailor to have a suit fitted and they banter back and forth. It's the best part of the book and since it occupies the first quarter or so, everything after fails to quite live up to it. There are still plenty of clever moments and shady, ambiguous characters but this ended up dragging for me towards the end. Loving that sucking on the teeth though!"
1,Not My Cup of Tea,"I have to admit that I had a negative view of this author before I started reading the book, but because of his reputation and the good reviews I thought I would give him another chance. I don't know what it is but I just cannot get into one of his books. I think they move very slow and are just not peppy. Maybe I just have a short attention span, but I need more pep in a book then this author delivers. I did enjoy the movie (I keep giving him chances), but the books put me to sleep. I actually thought the overall story line was an interesting new twist to the cold war era spy story but I just could not keep turning the pages on this one."
2,"If you saw the movie, Do not read.","The plot though rather good, could not keep my attention. Some of the characters are well written, but others, seem to drag the book down. The book does not flow and you will find yourself putting it down to do something. The story is a satire on the time when America has just handed over the Panama canal. Though I cannot believe that any agency would fall for the information that was passed on by Harry, the tailor and would be spy. Of course I read the whole book, becasue my rule is once you start ....finish it. Other wise , I would have put it down. Just watch the movie."
1,A Book to Sleep By,"The Tailor of Panama was described as a spy story. After three quarters of the first tape, the story had yet to get to anything to do with spying. It talked about a tailor-well at least the name of the book was right-and described all the customers of the tailor, from British Royalty to Communistic Leaders. It talked of the politics and even had a customer come in to get fitted for a suit. It described the receptionist and how she had gotten the scars on her face. But it never set the scene for a spy story.The book, which was compared to Casablanca, would make interesting reading for someone that enjoys the intricacies of politics and lots of in-depth details. It is a very dry read."
2,So-so tailor.,"The Tailor of Panama is only so-so.It becomes muddled, confusing, too much attention is placed on the interactions of the various characters, a decent espionage plot is not given the attention it should.This was not one of the better spy books."
3,Panamá?,"I have enjoyed many other Le Carré books, and being from Panamá was thrilled to get my hands on the tailor of panama. The book in itself is very good, but for me, it was hard to read, hard to belive and really get into the book, because the panama in the book is SOOOO different from what Panama really is. With the other books, it is easy to take Le Carré's word about the countries in which the novels take place, because i know little about them. But with Panama, it was hard to just give up the truth and take le carré's word for it. He was misrepresentative of practically everything...even the social clases and the Union Club. Enjoy the book, but don't believe all you read."
3,Well observed if a little disjointed,Seems to be written with the aim of being rather clever - and mostly succeeds. But it is a little disjointed and after a slow first nine tenths rather hurrys to a conclusion. Still well worth a read
5,"Oxnard, English","In Constant Gardner, Le Carre showed that he had lost the Cold War & hadn't found a role. In Tailor of Panama he showed that all was not lost. Two of the best characters in a small subset of modern fiction are here, Pendel & Oxnard, and the plot Le Carre has built for them is a beautiful thing. Constant Gardner is dismal. Tailor of Panama is brilliant; it's only defect is that, being very good, it became the source of a very bad movie."
3,"Not LeCarre's best effort, but an enjoyable book.","This book is a departure for LeCarre. He paints in much broader strokes here. One result is that this is a much quicker read than most of his which require more attention to nuance. There is more tendency to caricature than character, but I am generally in favor of any book which reveals the Intelligence Community to be people by fools and charlatans."
3,Nothing extraordinary,"I was a bit disappointed with this CD. There are some songs on this playlist that should have blown away the listener but that was not the case. The music, at best, is background music, certainly nothing to savor and play and play again. If anything, this CD makes one listen to the true classics of Beethoven, Dvorak, Vivaldi, Mozart and others."
3,pleasant easy listening,"It's not extremely interesting music, but nice background, relaxing and pleasant with full orchestra. Not a bad buy at all!"
4,"Old school favorites, ""Maquina"" style","Includes the big hit ""Carino Santo"" plus all of these oldies but goodies. Great sound as always. They're lucky enough to have the best saxophone player in this genre (who also wrote several songs on this compilation). If you've ever liked any of their songs, you'll love this CD. Play it loud and play it proud!!"
4,Wonderful poetry,"Writer of some wonderful poetry, including two beautiful pieces entitled ""And Sometimes It Happens"" and ""A Blade of Grass"". Although I personally feel that there are some poems in this collection that fall short of the romantic expectations given by the title, this is a great book to curl up in bed with your lover and woo her with precious words. If that does not impress her, I have no idea what will!Shame it is out of print. But try and get it."
3,Saving the World Before Bedtime!,"I have to admit that I have always had a soft spot for the Powerpuff Girls. I find the frequently tongue-in-cheek humour to be very witty and like most good cartoons are, this one is thoroughly entertaining for both kids and adults alike. My favourite Cartoon Network character is actually Dexter's Lab but until they release that on DVD I guess this will have to do as second best. This DVD has been very well thought out and designed and contains good bonus features as well as 10 great episodes. Highly recommended for a good laugh!"
2,Useless!,"I so wanted these scissors to work out!I really need a good pair of scissors and I like the Gingher quality which is the best I've found so far, but is it too much to ask to make these scissors ergonomic too?!I've already purchased Gingher G-8SA Spring Action Shears 8-Inch, and although they are very sharp, they are so hard to use because of the metal handles, they pinch a nerve at the base of my thumb.Gingher GS-9 Lightweight Bent Trimmers, 9-Inch are very sharp, good plastic handles to protect my hand but it doesn't have the spring action to make it easy to use!!!It is pretty heavy and even with a drop of oil; I couldn't get these scissors to work without an effort that hurt my hand again. It is a pain to open them and try to cut fabric fast.I simply couldn't use them at all, I had to return them!Gingher, is it really so hard to get all 3 (sharpness, ergonomic handles and spring action) in one pair of scissors?"
3,Works OK but suction cups are not completely secure,Was hoping that I could use the 2X magnification so I didn't need my reading glasses when shaving.The magnification does not work as well as my reading glasses 1.5 power.The suction cups have already come loose once and I am concerned that the mirror is likely to eventually fall off and break.
4,Purchased as a 'play' amp for my new guitar,"I ordered this last week when it was on sale for $8.60 and for that price, it was well worth it. It sounds okay although I do hear a slight hiss when it's on. Overall though, worth the money at less than $9 and makes a great practice amp for my acoustic-electric guitar."
5,it is awsome great sound works great it makes guitar hero air guitar sound like you are in a band i would recomend it,it awsome what can i say it got great sound it is a good amp for someone staring out it works great with guitar hero air guitar it makes you sound like the big boys. don't take my word get one you well be happy you did it is good a stand alone guitar amp. so to all rock on
1,Tac Guitar Mania Amp,"I am pleased with the sound this amplifier has, but when I got this item I had to glue it back together cuz the packaging it was in was horrible and it pretty much was a cheap, piece a .... I however have found better use for the dials and speaker on it and soon to disgard the cruddy wood box this amp was suppose to be in. Guitarists around the world would frown upon this item. And my appologies for not giving feedback sooner. Have a busy work schedual"
1,Piece of Crap,This is useless trash...! the contact are very poor. Has lot of static and is not usable.I would not recommend it to anyone. Only the price is good.
1,Some possible understanding,"I think the idea of this product is to allow ""guitarists"" the opportunity to use the game as a backing band to practice with. I read somewhere in a description that you could connect the audio RCA plugs that come from your ps2 into the front of the amp (thus all sound from the game comes from the amp), along with your guitar (and microphone if you're a singer). Personally, that's a rather stupid idea anyway. I think pluging the audio RCAs into a stereo would work much better and you could use a REAL amp for your guitar. $50 does not a ""good"" amp buy."
3,Vietnam War - Eyewitness books,"This is to replace a book my son checked out and lost, so I can't review it very well."
3,Afraid to be optimistic,"I absolutely LOVED this dishwasher. It has 3 racks that have worked perfectly for my loads. HOWEVER, I am scheduled for my first (and last, I hope) service call because the control panel went haywire. No matter what wash setting you select (light, normal, heavy), the dishwasher jumps to the rinse only option after 5 minutes or so. On it's own. Frustrating!! After reading the reviews I see a LOT of issues with not only the control panel, but also the latch handle and other things breaking. Great. Is this what my future holds? I really want to be optimistic because I have j-u-s-t finished replacing all my appliances with Maytag - believing (naively) in the quality and good name they once had. (insert sigh) I hope I'm wrong, but I just get that sick feeling in my tummy...you know...the one where you realize you have shelled out a lot of $$ for a huge paperweight?"
4,Body Wash,I like Laura Mercier products but the body wash is a little too thick in texture for my taste; it does have a very nice fragrance.
2,Creme Brulee Honey Bath,"The only good thing about this item was the nice scent of creme brulee. Other than this, there is no difference in this brand than any other that I have purchased. The price definitely was too high for this product."
2,Needs a lot more filling in to be useful,This book serves as a guide for the men who fought in Central America from the 1880's through the great depression. It recounts their exploits but really does not get into their motives. Simply calling them soldiers of fortune does not make sense when their exploits are explored in detail. I think this book has value as a starting guide except for the fact that it requires a lot of knowledge on the history to begin with. The author's attempts at trying to determine which groups were responsible for which raids leave a large scholarly gap to be filled. This books value is limited and really should only be used as a quick review of what happened.
5,A Great Book,"This is a wonderful read. Vivid accounts of mercenaries and capitalists and their deeds in the early part of the century. The research put into this book is impressive. They provide little known facts about the individuals central to the travesty brought by American involvement. The lives of Lee Christmas, Samuel Zemurray and others from the period are fascinating. Their stories deserved to be told and this book has done a great job of doing so."
5,A classic deserving of DVD release,"I am a true collector of all types of holiday movies and specials. I remember watching BC First Thanksgiving on HBO many years ago. I was able to get it on VHS and even transferred it to DVD. Only a couple of years ago did I become aware of BC A Special Christmas. I was able to get a good, used copy of it. I am glad I did. I liked it even more than the Thanksgiving special.It has a good story to it which the Thanksgiving special was a bit lacking on. The gift selling scheme and presents purchasing scam are interesting. The real treat to the show is the ending. The references to the three wise men on their way to see the baby Jesus and the Christmas star give you that warm feeling that I like to get from a Christmas special.I was not able to burn this VHS to DVD. It has macrovision on it. So, I only watch the video once or twice per seasons to preserve the tape. I just hope that one day that both of these specials will be released on DVD."
3,Not what I had hoped for....,"Although the book does mention a few connections that I had missed, I was immediately turned off by the large number of errors. The entries for Cujo, IT, Needful Things, and Salem's Lot all contained errors, including wrong names, dates, and plot lines. For a book that is supposed to tie everything together, the errors are confusing and misleading. At this point, with the Dark Tower series coming to an end, the book is obsolete. The newest book it mentions is Bag of Bones. I would look for an updated version, or another book entirely, if you want to have an outline of the Stephen King Universe."
2,Kind of amusing,"This book tries to link together everything in Stephen King's books. Sometimes it tries too hard. Like finding a character name from one book simply mentioned in another. Not too mind-blowing. Some of the interconnections were intersting, but overall nothing to write home (or a book) about."
1,I guess their hearts were in the right place,"But there are many typos and factual errors in this book. Also, it never really does what it proposes. This book has already been written before -- they do nothing new here. Sorry guys, nice try."
3,Not bad but.....,"I was excited to read this book being a fan for years and years and I was interested in learning of all the connections, some I was aware of and many I was not. However, there were some errors, and as I believe someone else mentioned, if you haven't read the books, the endings are all revealed, all though somewhat simplified. This was the fundamental problem with the whole book, it read like a high school book report. What I did enjoy about the book was that it made mention of many stories I had read but forgot about and I plan on rereading most of them."
5,No shippment recieved...,"Still have not recived shippment, long overdue and I am very annoyed as I really needed that book urgently....The book is great as I have used it before, but your shippment service is extrememly poor...."
1,YUCK!,I baked one batch of cookies on my Silpat and 1 on this red mat. Silpat cookies are yummy! Red mat cookies are have a melted plastic taste. My kitchen smells like melting plastic instead of freshly baked cookies. I won't be using the Roshco mat again! Certainly wouldn't want any of my friends/family to bake on it either!
1,These mats smoked terribly in the oven and made food taste like plastic,"I purchased these and hand washed as stated. I placed them on a cookie sheet and made a batch of cookies- While they were baking- my smoke detector went off- there wasn't any smoke that I could ""see"" but it set it off. When I opened the oven there was some smoke- but I thought perhaps it was some baked over food. The cookies took longer to bake by 2-3minutes. They also had a strange taste to them- sort of like plastic.I later tried using these again- but put breaded fish on them and in a 350deg oven- within minutes of the oven coming to temp. smoke was pouring out of the oven- I had to take the whole pan and food out onto the porch as it was very toxic smelling and smoke everywhere!!I would not recommend these to ANYONE and I am going to try contacting the company with my problem.Hope this review helps."
3,Roshco red silicone baking mat,"I own Silpat mats but used my red silicone mat for the first time today. I found that it smelled badly and when heated to 350 degrees in my gas oven it changed colors to a dark cranberry color. It cleaned up nicely and in minutes, but it really smelled. I would like to know what other owners have to say about the smell of their silicome baking ware. I rated this product a 3 for its ease of use and easy clean-up, but the smell downgrades it to a 1 or 2 star rating for me. I will give it another try and see if the smell goes away with future use."
3,Use it as a toaster oven mat,"The red and blue colors are as depicted. On another website, they were selling silicone mats for the toaster oven, microwave and regular oven for a much higher price for essentially this same product. I use this on the Delongi toaster oven to catch the stuff that magically appears on the bottom. I do take it out if I broil though and place foil instead. It's easy to clean and so far, durable. I hand wash it versus putting it in the dishwasher. I hope they will manufacture a large round one (maybe for pizza pans???) so I can put it in my microwave."
1,Junk,Tossed these in the trash not long after getting them. Couldn't keep them clean to save my life and they didn't fit a standard cookie sheet anyhow.
2,better than nothing,"I have not had any of the smoking or flavor-altering problems that other reviewers seem to have had, but I would not recommend these to anyone. My main problem (and this has been a huge annoyance to me) is that the mats seem to expand and buckle up while I am cooking. This ends with large air pockets under the mat and a ridiculously rippled mat. This distorts the cookies and causes other general problems. It is sufficiently non-stick and does seem to prevent over-browning of the bottoms when making bread or cookies, but that only means that they are better than nothing. I have used Silpat while cooking with family members and the Roshco product performs blatantly sub-par to Silpat. Save your money and your patience and buy a better product."
2,baking mat,"This mat works well for brownies, However it does not fit a standard 9"" X 13"" pan. it is also difficult to clean as it has a ruller molded into one side and a 1/64"" raised border on one side."
4,A book about jazz and then some.,Oh what a silly idea. How can I write a review about this book when 1. I have not read it yet. 2. I buy lots of books about jazz on line. It sometimes takes me two to three years to catch up with a particular book and so all I can say is it was written by Leonard Feather who wrote many great books about jazz and so I expect this will be as good as they get.
3,This product is OK,"I had bought this because my husband and I have YEARS worth of 35 MM negatives that we are trying to protect. I had bought this because it is a great price. The only down side to this is that there is no holes on the side for you to put in a binder of some sort. Part of it is my fault for not noticing this prior to purchase or before using about 1/2 the package. It is still a great price, and they feel durable. I just have to find a way to 3 hole punch through Plastic (size of sleeves are bigger than your standard 3 whole punch). Does anyone have suggestions?"
1,Where is the fiber?,"I have taken many Green Super Foods and this one has no fiber and costs way too much money for the overall nutrition that you get. I guess when you write a book, you think that allows you to deplete nutrition and pump profits."
2,The beginning of the long slide,"This is a very lackluster album. R.E.M. started sinking into mediocrity with this album, and the trend has continued to this date, through Out Of Time, Automatic For The People (NOT NEARLY as good as people seem to think it is, in my opinion), the awful Monster, New Adventures in Hi-Fi, and now the new album Up. This used to be my absolute favorite band. Now, I can hardly listen to them. What a fall...."
3,Here's a band that shouldn't use minor scales and just stick with what they do best,"I realize why I never was interested in REM in the first place. They exploded in popularity at a time when their musical style became excessively commercial and unappealing. The first song I ever heard was ""Stand,"" and I totally loved it. Then I heard ""Losing My Religion,"" and that's where they totally lost me. I still kind of like this album as a whole, because it has some superb songs on it which give it a major boost, like Pop Song 89, Get Up, and Stand. But it's sad and depressing tunes like Orange Crush that make me want to turn the radio off and go to bed. I have Murmur, which is a great album, but it seems as if everything after this album is just not worth a listen, with the exception of a handful of really upbeat tunes. I can't say for sure whether or not they sold out, as I don't know their history or intentions, but I would personally stick with only their classic albums."
2,Overrated album from an Overrated band,"If you're offended by my statement, put it in your pipe and smoke it. I bought this album when it first came out, and it wasn't a bad album, except that for the three or four hits from it, the rest of the record was absolutely boring. What made it irritably boring is Michael Stipe's wavering voice in songs that should have been best sung by perhaps another member of the band. In addition, the overhype in the media about this band kind of ended it for me after this album. There were a couple of good songs from followup efforts, but essentially this band went the way of U2: Overhyped, oversold, in your face, all the time.I don;t begrudge them their success as they've certainly earned it, but when the media started focusing on the homosexuality of the lead singer (of which I couldn't care less anyway), the band responded by breaking up some time later. They made their millions. The overnight success and over-promotion killed them for me. A shame."
2,Mostly drivel. Stay away from this one.,"Unfortunately, I bought this on the advice of love-is-blind REM fans, and ignored the level-headed reviewers.Most of the songs are filler-drivel. Orange Crush is OK and you've probably heard it many times on alternative radio. But even OC, though it has a big sound, is repetitive.I don't like being threatened, as is done in Turn You Inside-out, and I can't stand the self-centered whiney blathering of several other songs - World Leader Pretend, I Remember California, Hairshirt, etc. Go ahead count the number of times the vocals start out, ""I..."". It's annoying. Yes, there are a couple of decent songs and good musicianship, but I expect more from REM.If you still want a copy I'll be selling mine..."
3,Fair,"This album is OK. I am a huge REM fan, but this album just doesn't quite have the songs to put it on on pair with other REM classics (Life's Rich Pageant, Murmur, Best Of). Orange Crush is a great rocker, though."
4,Small band makes big jump,"I love this recording, even if not everything on it is absolutely top-flight R.E.M. But there's enough invention here to justify anyone's buying this and getting hours of pleasure out of it.Favorites are Pop Song 89, Stand, Get Up and Orange Crush, the latter track being one of the most chilling of their output. All of these are irresistibly catchy, very well played with high production values, and recorded with a clarity that makes Michael Stipe & Co. seem right in your living room.No, this project isn't as edgy as their earlier work, but I still like most of what's here. Even so-so R.E.M. is a good bit better than many other bands out there. (And hey, just program out what you don't care for.)"
3,This album marked the decline of REM,"Even though this album had some great songs, I would argue that it was greatly inferior to the work this band had done earlier. It became clear to those of us who had revered the music from the IRS years that REM would sell out and go commercial. Indeed, this is exactly what happened. REM changed their direction and became increasingly rich but more and more irrelevent. Ahh, a sad old story..."
2,The long dark fall into night,"After 5 of the greatest albums in rock history (Murmur, Reckoning, Fables..., Lifes Rich Pageant, Document) + pre-Murmur EP's and singles, REM started on the downhill track with this one. The songs are dull and offer no compelling reason to listen. Before this album, I would automatically buy the new REM sound-unheard. After this one, I had to think carefully whether it was worth the money - now THAT's green."
3,R.E.M. at its worst,"Even the best alternative band of the 80's and 90's has to have a low point. And, low point as it may be, that doesn't mean it's all that bad; compared to some of the other releases of its day, Green is a pretty good listen. Still, it's too mediocre for R.E.M.'s high standards, which have now been set by the near-perfect albums Up and New Adventures In Hi-Fi. ""You Are the Everything"" pales in comparison to the band's later attempts at beautiful melodies; ""Stand"", although intentionally stupid, is almost too stupid to listen to; ""The Wrong Child"" has an interesting composition, but doesn't really go anywhere considering its length; ""Hairshirt"" is just plain annoying, repetitive, and is probably the band's worst song to date. Still, ""Pop Song 89"" is a decent pop song, ""Turn You Inside-Out"" is an excellent example of R.E.M.'s harder side, and the eleventh untitled track leaves the album off with some hope."
2,Boring pop music from a usually fascinating band,"I am a big REM fan, and I advise new fans to stay clear of ""Green"". I'm also old enough to have been an original fan of the Byrds, the Band, other great acts with whom they are often compared to, and I can tell you that REM is more interesting, more adventuresome and more versatile than the Byrds or almost any of the '60's bands to whom they are compared. But not on Green. For newer fans who wonder what REM was like in the '80's, choose Murmer or Documentor the sort of Greatest Hits,Eponymous. Also,I have nothing against good REM pop music, and for that, I like to Out of Time, from 1991, which sold millions and deserved to.Green's ""Orange Crush"" is a good rocker about a serious subject. Otherwise, totally disposable. Sounds like they owed the record company an other album."
2,Easily the worst album by an otherwise compelling band.,"I'm a huge fan of REM, and have been for years, but this album is without a doubt their worst. Stipe is at his most pretentious, and the prosteletyzing becomes cumbersome, to say the least. Not a single redeemable song. I actually lost interest in this band for several years after the release of this dog. Two stars is probably generous."
4,Great and varied,"Green is a fantastic record. some REM (IRS-period fanatics) set this record below records like ""Dead letter office"" wich is totally silly. ""Dead letter"" is an interestning collection for the fans but thats all it is, a scrapbook, not great when it comes to solid songwriting.That said, Green is a sparkling great record that delivers mood swings like no other record. The songs are either uplifting, energy-filled or slow, reflective and melancholic.All energy-driven rocky songs are Great...Pop song, Get up, Stand, Turn you inside out, Orange CR. etc..........You are the everything, the wrong child and hairshirt are so calm and beutiful you feel the songs eat their way into your heart. Almost all songs are fantastic, but ""I remember California"" sounds like a remake of odd fellows local 151 to me.The sound of this record is more in style with OUT OF TIME than ""Document"" a year earlier."
1,uh,"The worst thing is that some of these guys are capable, even skilled musicians. But it all falls flat. You need a PhD in BS to get any meaning out of ""Orange Crush."" (Actually, you can get every meaning out of the song since the lyrics are nonsensical and vague). Stipe grunts/mumbles his incoherent blather and then expounds his ""message"" via interviews and t-shirt slogan. With so many artists out there who have something to say, why would you waste your time with these featherweight intellects diddlng simple riffs the Beatles made obsolete years ago?Stay away, unless you like REM and its souless egofest, then by all means, strap on a bib and dig in to a thoroughly incomprehensible meal."
4,The bridge between old and new.,"It always amuses me the way some call this garbage, and others say it's one of their best. I'll just call it a very solid REM release. To me ""Green"" is kind of the last album you can still hear the early sound a bit, but also hear what's on the way in tracks like ""Orange Crush"" and ""You Are The Everything"". ""Stand"" was a big hit at the time, but has since taken on a ""Shiny Happy People"" vibe about it. I also really like ""Get Up"" and ""Wrong Child"" alot, and honestly every track here is good at the least. REM have so many great albums out that it's hard to say what's best, but I'll always have a soft spot for ""Green"", since it's the first one of theirs I really absorbed. Oh, and there's 11 tracks, the 11th being one of the best."
5,Precursor to Out of Time,"I would say that Green paved the road to Out of Time. It was a move to more popish sounds and catchy tunes. There is nothing wrong with that if it's done by R.E.M. They managed to include Mike's cryptic lyrics in some songs. This album doesn't grow old. It's a fresh beginning of a new direction for the band. One of my favs is World Leader Pretend. I would classify it as having good ""old"" lyrics and new sound. It's one of the most intellectual songs by the band."
4,A good Product,"This fit my 1981 CJ7 AMC 20 Rear differential with no modifications needed: I didn't particularly want a chrome cover but; the price was right so I went for it. It is made well and the chrome job was good. I wish it had a magnet and a drain plug in it but; that is probably why it was cheaper than the rest. I have to admit, that after I got it on it looked pretty good. It sealed nicely, with no leaks, on the first try (with a little help from some RTV)It takes a little elbow grease to keep it clean and shiny (Water spots) Overall, I would recommend this product and would buy it again at the price I got it for, if I was in the market for another one."
4,Very strong effort from excellent band,"Cherry Tree has a very different feel from the most recent release 'Alligator'. It is quieter, is full of violins and kind've brings back memories of Dire Straits 'making moves' on 'All Dolled up In Straps'. With the exception of the last track on this EP all the other songs are very good with 'Cherry Tree' being the neatest and artiest song."
4,Calling it their best work may be damning with faint praise,"This is the only National record that does a whole lot for me, and it's mostly because of ""Wasp Nest,"" one of the few tracks not to be reprinted from one of their full-length albums. It's nice and sinister, without lapsing into the arena-rock-apologism that these guys are famous for.If you like Leonard Cohen more than REM, you should buy this record. Otherwise, look at the rest of their catalogue."
2,Bad Description,"AFTER TYPING IN THAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR A MUSIC BOOK FOR THE TITLE ""BETTER THAN LIFE"", the SITE took us to this item. Item description says it is ""MUSIC; but not audio music. But after buying it , discovered it was a CD music. It's still a good music CD, but not what we were looking for and not what was inaccurately descripted!!"
4,Being There!,"Being There is a timeless classic, and reminds me of many people we see in public life.Chauncey Gardiner as portrayed by the acting genius who's subtleties that only Peter Seller can command.Chauncey Gardiner as portrayed by the rhetorical nonsense that Barak Hussien Obama can command.See the point."
2,A Little Disappointed,"A caller to the Rush Limbaugh show recommended the movie. Rush had seen it. I suppose I read more into their comments than was there. It is a rather slow movie, but then they needed to develope the theme which did hang together. I believe they were trying to demonstrate how absurdities in public life and politics become accepted and no one challenges them because of who accepts them. I do think they succeeded. But I kept thinkig about where I would have gone with the theme and they did not go there. The ending was one more absurdity on top of the rest with Gardener walking across the surface of the lake. He even demonstrates for the audience that the lake is deep by dipping his umbrella into it. But the meaning of this last action was lost on me. Sorry."
1,no chance,"I guess i am the only person on the planet that found this film as one of the worst film i have wasted time watching, i got NOTHING out of the film, it must be me?"
3,The Ending Makes the Film,"This film did not make sense to me until the jaw-dropping ending (a complete surprise in an otherwise tepid film). I am always mystified that some people do not seem to grasp the significance of the final scene. I won't divulge it, and there are spoilers elsewhere in these reviews, so I'll just say that if you liked Forrest Gump, watch this movie and decide for yourself. In my opinion the ending explains the entire film, and had I not watched the film thru the end I would have come away dissatisfied, as the rest of the film is not enough.Some reviewers have said that the point of the film is that a simple life is better. I say that the point of the film is that we all ""know too much."" As Yoda says, ""You must unlearn what you have learned."""
5,Director Hal Ashby is fast becoming a forgotten BEST!!,"Shirley McClain, Peter Seller Plus one of the best outtake scene playing under end credits. That alone is double the price and your Mom! is not enough!! ""(Go Te ell Raaphaael!!"") say no more !!"
5,perfect,"simply put, one of the finest films ever made. Only the ending ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" compares to the spiritual and philosophical beauty of the finale to ""Being There"". END"
5,Being There,"This is a classic. I read this book before seeing the film and was entertained by both. I reside within an hours's drive of Biltmore House in NC, and at the time this was one of the first major motion pictures filmed there. Peter Sellars is not the Pink Panther here, so do not enter expecting slapstick comedy. Rather, see what can happen when the truth is so obvious that no one sees it.....Gil..."
4,A Comic Gem,"It's been said about a million times, but Peter Sellers was a true comic genius. And this is one of his very best films."
4,Being There with Peter Sellers,"The film has to be seen, in whatever format you can get hold of. It is one of Peter Sellers' finest works and a great story. It concerns a gardener, who has lived his whole life in the confines of the house of a wealthy benefactor. His only contact with the outside world is a small selection of TV programmes. When his benefactor dies, he is thrown out into the world and his homespun, naive philosophy, ralted only to his gardening and TV programmes, strikes a chord with all he meets - with astounding results."
5,He's not the Pink Panther -- He's Better In This!,Peter Sellers stars in this fabuously well written tale of a simpleton who rises through a strange set of circumstances to become advisor to a president. An excellent cast supports Sellers -- Shirley MacLaine and Jack Warden.One of the first movies to use outtakes as the trailer during the film credits. And they are hysterical!
4,This first Forrest Gump,"A sleeper when first released, I think people who like Forrest Gump would like this film. Not much it terms of extras. It seems that outtakes and deleted scenes for this film would have made an excellent addition. None-the-less, a very good value for a DVD with good sound and picture for the price."
3,Insomnia,"if you have the time, 2 hrs and 5 minutes worth of free time, because you can't sleep, and you like sellers, then this might be the film for you, otherwise, this is what anyone would call a slow, very slow moving picture. I gave it 3 stars, because, i kinda liked it. I like the fact that you can do as Chance did and be someone of few words and be quite literally taken as someone who is profound. The Mansion is also an amazing backdrop for this film, wonder who lives in it now..."
2,being there dvd,"It is obvious that some portions of the movie were cut out on the dvd version of Being There which was disapointing to me. I don't know if the vhs version is the complete film or not, but I would have opted for vhs if it was a complete version of the film."
1,Grossly Overrated,"I found myself waiting through the entire film for this genius to reveal itself. Waiting. Waiting. Waiting. Right until the credits start rolling over unfunny outtakes, which seem harshly less appropriate here than say, in Talladega Nights.Chance, played by Peter Sellers, is painfully disconnected, not within the narrative but from the narrative. He's a fortunate simpleton. I get it. Tom Hanks got it too in Forrest Gump. The difference is that Forrest is dynamic and likable, Chance is a roulette ball that rolls obliviously for 2 hours and never drops. But the movie is not about Chance. The star turns into the backdrop before which society plays the real fool. That's profoundly ironic, let me tell ya.It's slow, quite dated, and the extent to which the viewer is asked to suspend their disbelief is absurd. Would I sit through it again? As Bartleby said, I prefer not to."
3,Silly,"The title of this movie may be ""Being There"" but the plot isn't there at all. Shirley MacLaine and Peter Sellers team up to form the story of a man who has been a gardener all his life that suddenly shows up on Maclaine's doorstep. Maclaines husband, dying from aplastic anemia, likes the man, and so they take him in. His name is Chance, but Shirley mistakenly mistakes if for Chauncy, hence the name, Chauncy Gardener becomes this man's own. No one seems to realize the man is a simple minded child, and he even gets to meet the President of the United States and go on a TV show. It is obvious to the most casual observer that ""Chauncy"" is simple minded, probably even retarded, but not obvious to anyone in the film. Because of this, the film lacks reality and the acting is flat."
5,"Chauncey Gardiner, a most brilliant man","Chauncey Gardiner is a man that reminds us all of life's simple pleasures and of life's harsh realities we wish we never had to understand. He is not only innocent minded but is also very surreal. He is one of the most loveable characters ever to appear on page. After all, the mind of a child is not as threatening as one of an attorney or politician. He's so simple that he is ablsolutely brilliant. END"
4,Being There,"""Deluxe Edition"" seems to me to be an overstatement. The movie is as I remember it and that is fine. The carrying case is standard. No extra DVD and no shorts that seem to be anything more than the current standard for films on DVD."
3,Being There,An oldie but goodie. it's been years since I've watched this film and it is still great. Peter Sellers was a genius.
4,Great film; mediocre Blu-ray,"This is a comedy classic. It is arguably the best film about television ever made. And it is clearly the best film about ""the suit makes the man"" to the extreme.And it looks better than it ever has before.But it could look better. Black levels are poor, with murky grays everywhere, and noise reduction has been over-used. One professional review notes: ""the studio applied some aggressive Digital Noise Reduction. The problem is quite severe in some scenes, especially the opening. Film grain freezes in place while the action of the scene moves around it. Detail is mushy, and objects smear when in motion.""The sound is good. You really get the clear-but-clanky presentation of the TV shows that form the backgroun or foreground of many scenes. But beware, for some bizarre reason, the default soundtrack is not the lossless track, but the DD1.0 track. Whose silly idea was that?"
5,Peter Sellers' Finest Hour,"BEING THERE is by far the most wonderful satire I have ever seen. What a pity it wasn't Sellers' final film (rather than the dreadful FIENDISH PLOT OF DR. FU MANCHU, which he didn't live to complete). And what a pity he didn't win the Oscar for his performance in it. He is simply brilliant...as is the movie. It is simply one of the best films ever made. The social, political and human satire is perfect. Thank you, everyone concerned, for leaving us this wonderful film!"
2,Being there,Didn't get a chance to watch it all will have to order again or hopefully it's on my resereve and I can just watch it.
4,Love of Being There,"I saw this movie maybe 20 years ago. It left such an impression the first time, I had to add it to my collection so I could view and share it with others at any time"
4,Being There,"Just a wonderful vehicle for Peter Sellers. It not only illustrates his comedic abilities, but also the strength of his straight acting. There is a wonderful cameo from Shirley Maclaine, and the supporting cast are exactly that. This is a heart-warming, yet on deeper consideration quite sad film - 'What if......?', and I rate it highly."
5,One of Americas Greatest Movies,I must fall back on being humble and refuse to review what has to be considered one of Americas finest movies ever made. I'm not qualified nor do I posess the ability to adequetely praise this movie. It is a true masterpiece that I am glad that the long ill Peter Sellers lived long enough to make.If you own any DVDs or Blu Rays...this HAS to be in your collection or a real collection you don't have.
1,Magritte meets Heidegger,"Take the absurdity of Magritte + a bit of existentialism (being there) from Heidegger and this movie attempts to add up to whole lot of NOTHING. Unfortunately, it succeeds."
3,Over rated film,"""Being There"" is a movie that has the potential to be a witty statement about our culture, but instead, ends up failing to live up to it's expectations.The movie has Peter Sellers playing a simpleton who ends up befriending some rich and powerful people and becoming a national celebrity. The humour of the movie comes from the fact that the simple things that Sellers character says are misinterpreted as brilliant observations.With that intriguing premise, the movie is off to a great start, but unfortunately, the picture never goes anywhere after this setup. The film, simply recycles this same idea over and over again until the film's ending. The viewer keeps expecting the picture to take off and go somewhere talking about American culture, or the media's fascination with celebrities, but it does'nt seem to have anything to say. What a shame."
5,Solving the world problems,"The movie's underlying statement is that all the world's problems could be solved simply. That there is season and a purpose under heaven, and no matter how hard and complicated we try to make things around us, basically, it is very simple. Peter Sellers, as ""Chauncy"", is often described as dimwitted and retarded. However, I disagree, he is merely reflecting how seeing things in respect to one's expercience in life, we can draw our own answers. The other characters in the movie merely expand on his point of view, drawing their own answers as well. The billionaire, the President, the Ambassdor of Russia, men of great education, power and knowledge, however, so caught up in their own inherent selfish interest. They fail to realize how things could be resolved by just showing a genuine interest in your fellow human being. Basic things in live: food , shelter and a sense of purpose. Now what is wrong with that? We should all be gardeners..........."
1,"Stupid, boring movie","One of the few movies that I could not finish watching, I was so grossed out by the bad acting and an incredibly silly plot. This movie is so bad that I had to turn off my DVD player because I was about to throw up."
1,Disappointed,"I received the DVD about 10-14 days after I ordered it, and towards the end it was not working. I'm trying to get a refund or replaced, but they are very slow....."
2,this movie is underwhelming,i bought this movie because of recommendations both online and from friends. i didn't care for it and did not finish watching it. so much for reviews from others. your mileage may vary.
1,So painful to watch that I,"wanted to burst into tears. I like movies that are long, with character development, but this isn't one of them. I can't believe how many people gave this movie 4 or 5 stars. This is a movie/plot that could have been cut down to 90 minutes and STILL have been way too long of a movie. Lastly, what the heck was up with the ending?! I didn't get that at all. My family and I sat there and stared at each other blankly when the credits started rolling, then had to watch another movie to try to erase the painful memories of that one. Ugh."
4,One of the most brilliant movies of all time!,"Peter Sellers sure picked a winner as he starred in the last movie of his career. ""Being There"" follows the story of an honest simpleton who leaves his sheltered private garden to enter the intimidating and confusing world of Washington D.C. He accidentally stumbles into the lives of a powerful senator and his lonely socialite wife (Shirley McClain). From there, his simple ways are misinterpreted as political brilliancy and he's pimped out by the puppetmaster senators into the media--a new possible candidate for the upcoming presidential election. Shirley McClain is also amazing as a frustrated woman who turns to Peter Sellers for comfort and ends up ""self-fulfilled"" thanks to his obsession with television. The ending of this movie must be seen to be believed. I highly recommend this movie."
5,Wonderful film,I am not sure there are deep meanings in this film. I only know it's a wonderful film you will remember forever.
2,No surprise,"This unit came right up. It does not handle Vista Windows Aero, but that is a Vista problem and it's need for more than 1GB of memory to use that mode. It is fast and has not crashed. Networked painlessly. There is a problem with the camera. It appears to be HP related and is being worked on. So the box is great, but Vista will take time to get used to, though it does seem very stable. PhotoShop CS2 no problem. Bottom line. It is an excellent laptop. Old printers and scanners were found by Vista and function."
4,Perfect Notebook for College Student,"I bought this notebook for my son who is a college student. He thinks its great but I found a few shortcomings. Unlike the Toshiba Satellite I bought for myself, the HP Pavilion DV6245 did not come with any documentation or a Vista backup disk. In addition, the HP tech support is probably the worst on the sub-content. Finally, to upgrade the memory to 2GB you must first discard the two 512 MB modules. All in all still a good notebook. BTW I bought this notebook from Amazon when it was $1,122.99 so you may want to wait for yet another price cut."
4,"Good remake of ""Where the Boys Are""","First, newer DVD has original music, Older versions & VHS don't, and the difference is well worth getting the newer release. Also, letterboxing actually works here-- for some reason, quite a few details appear in left & right margins.Early 60's, ""good girls"" even 18 still really couldn't go out on their own, so they lie to parents about tgheir weekend plans and go to Myrtle Beach for a big party weekend to elebrate one's getting married (Phoebe Cates). Plans go awry when they meet some boys (of course). Bridget Fonda is ""the tease"", Annabeth Gish is ""Miss Innocent"", Page Hannah is the Senator's Daughter who tries to keep appearances.Feuding with locals, sorting out who's really in love with who, Fabulous dance contest near the end; look for a clumsy, uncoordinated boy about 8 who somehow gets in almost every scene in the dance competitions-- he's EVERYWHERE!"
5,Great Movie to watch on a girls night!!!,Some of my friends have been looking for this movie forever! Was worried that is what not the real one but one that had been modified with different songs! Pleased to discover this was the real thing! Bought this for me and a few friends!!!!
2,not really worth the money,The case does not close completely. The ear buds are uncomfortable and always fall out of my ears. I would have been better buying something else.
1,Tight and way too snug...,I bought this case in hopes of it being a cute case for my new Zen. Unfortunately when i got the case I tried it out and I could not press any of the buttons without it clicking it twice. I tried pressing the play button and all it would do is play then pause. The case was way to tight and the hope that it would stretch out was very small.The ear buds are great though. If you can find the ear buds alone someplace I definitely recommend buying them. Just leave the case out of it.
1,Time wasted,"The way to get millions must be to sell a tape like this one which helps no one. This tape should have a ""buyer beware"" label. Perhaps if you are from Louisiana you know the man and can give him a sales pitch... he needs it to help sell this tape!"
1,Only a sales pitch... worthless!,This was the worst waste of my time in years. It is in an interview format which is so set-up it isn't even funny. The answers are all the same to all the questions... a sales pitch from someone with nothing to say. You should be paid to listen to this; so don't waste money on it!
2,Archival print or negative pages,"This was a disappointment. These pages have apparently changed over the years. All of my ""archival"" 4x5 slides were returned in sleeves. Unfortunately, the pages are about 1/8"" too narrow to accommodate the 4x5 slides in their original sleeves. I have similar pages from quite distant orders where this was not a problem. So beware if you are attempting to buy these for all ""old"" 4x5 transparencies. You could use these easily for the transparencies alone, but without the added protection."
5,Fun window in time for any Chemistry major,"I received this book as a gift from my mother while I was in college (bio-chem major). My edition was printed in 1897 but the text dates back to its copyright filing in 1885*. That puts it at almost 130 years old. It's an interesting read from an era before Bohr. It's fun to look at what the author knew, didn't know, and how the unknowns were explained. It's odd to read a chemistry text with no mention of electrons, bonds, or even valence charges (although the idea of valence was understood and mentioned, there is just no explanation of it).These books can be found online on Google books but good physical copies can be found on Amazon, online, and in antique stores all over the US. It makes a great gift for any Chemist or serious chemistry student.*coincidentally the year Niels Bohr was born."
3,Good advice for the layman,This is a good book for the small business owner who wishes to incorporate without the expense of a lawyer. . . It can be done. Step by step advice.
4,Good variety and a lot of recipes,"This book is a good summary of many varieties of mixes that can be made as gifts. There is a broad selection. The price is a little high for a book that is not hard cover. However, there are a lot of recipes in it. Compared to the 'Gifts in a Jar' series you get many more recipes for the price. That series only has about 25 recipes... (Yes, there are nice recipe cards pre-made to attach to the recipe in the Gifts in a ..... series.)"
2,Book Sales Jargon great--------------Content Below average,I was very disappointed in this book. Many of the recipes were regular recipes wth directions to put in a quart jar. You could take any recipe from any book and do the same thing....(at a much cheapr price) The book reminds me of the fundraiser cookbooks. There were no illustrations and the instructions were not well written.
3,SUNKIST GOURMET FRUIT GEMS 144 COUNT,"Shipment arrived much faster than promised, was packed securely, excellent product."
3,Like these pages,I have not taken the time thus far to insert slides into these pages but believe they will be adequate for the task.
5,easy to find slides,This simplifies the way to store slides. Easy to get in and out. Also easy to group in small sections
4,"good, basic storage","As 35mm slides move into the past, it is pretty much impossible to find storage slide pages in the usual local office supply stores. It was nice to find them on Amazon, and it was even nicer that my pack of 25 pages was delivered from the seller without shipping & handling charges. There are some minor differences between the newer Print File slide pages and those that I had purchased some years ago. However, these minor changes do not translate into lesser quality. The seller delivered my slide pages early in the projected delivery window, and the USPO managed to get them to me without any sharp creases or puncture wounds. I considered giving a 5-star review, but I couldn't get excited enough by a simple storage product to go the distance. Regardless, I highly recommend this product for anyone who still has 35mm slides and wants to keep them nicely contained."

1,DONT WAIST YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have been looking for this soundtrack for years!! How do you possibly expect to sell this?! I have never been so disappointed!! Just think of how bad the ""Grease"" soundtrack would be without ""summer nights"" or ""you're the one that I want"" on it?! That is what you have done to this CD!! IT'S TERRIBLE!! The only reason I put one star is because there wasn't a field for -100 stars."
1,"This Soundtrack is not for the Orignial Shag, It's for the DVD version.","I too was disappointed by this supposed 'Shag: The Movie Soundtrack', and I recently purchased 'Shag' on DVD hoping for a newer, revamped picture quality. Yet, when watching the original, untouched, VHS version, the movie opens with 'Mama Said There'd Be Days Like This - Shirelles'; however, the newer DVD version opens with a song from this Soundtrack. Virtually none of the classic sixties songs that we all know and love from the Original are played in the new version of the movie. It's upsetting really. At least I was a little confused.So basically, this is the Official Soundtrack of the new DVD version of the movie, not the original. I'm guessing some copyright/money issues proved difficult to overcome when transferring the film the DVD. Some TV shows do the same thing; they mess with the song listings to avoid problematic situations."
1,Disappointing,"I always loved that song that went ""I used to smoke and drink and dance the hoochie koo..."" Does anyone know the name of that song so I can look for it on Limewire? It's a shame about the soundtrack. I bought this movie on video a couple years ago, and almost all of the songs I loved were mysteriously missing. I had to take the movie back...for me half of what makes Shag so special is the wonderful, lively soundtrack. I later heard they had to change the songs because of a dispute over royalty rights. Apparently there's black market copies of the original film circulating somewhere..."
1,SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME THE NAME OF THIS SONG!!!!,"Shag has been my favorite movie since the first time I saw it.Anyone who has not heard the wonderfull music in it is missing out. Granted ""stagger Lee"" and many other songs were not on the soundtrack, the one song that I don't know the name of,is my favorite song of all. The part of the movie that it is in..is when they are all talking about carson liking Jimmey Valentine and harley at the same time.It is the first time they are on the strand at night.It is the song before ""Stay"" Where Pudge and Buzz dance, because Carson won't dance with him unless he dances with her friend Pudge first.I hope that this is desciptive enough. ..."
2,Why I was so disappointed when I saw the songs on this album,"I love the movie Shag. It is the best. It is the most fun. I was very upset to find some of the best songs not included on the soundtrack. Especially ""Stagger Lee"", that song captures the whole essence of the film. I will probably buy the album anyway because I am obsessed with the movie, but I am still very disappointed.Oh, and if you haven't ever seen the movie I highly recomend it."
1,best movie..terrible soundtrack,"i'm like everyone else..NONE of the good songs from this great movie are on this soundtrack...but if you are looking for the ""ooohh...ahhhh"" song, it is ""ohh..ahh"" by jakki o!"
2,"Where is ""60 Minute Man""?","I too was disappointed with the soundtrack. Thank goodness I have the movie. Might have to buy another copy just so I can listen to the songs. Leaving out ""Stagger Lee"" and ""60 Minute Man"" was ludicrous! Who was the marketing genius who came up with this idea!"
1,shagless,I'm really disappointed in this soundtrack. I don't remember most of the these songs on this soundtrack. It's so wrong!!
2,Where to find some of the missing soundtrack songs from Shag,"I just ordered the ""I Love Beach Music"" double CD. It includes ""It Will Stand"" by The Showmen, and ""Stay"" by Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs. It's on the Ripete Records label and the release date is 10-22-96. You'll find ""Sixty Minute Man"" performed by The Dominoes on ""25 Beach Music Classics"" on the Varese Records label, release date 6-3-2003."
3,"Good, but could've been so much better...","I am an avid listener of Carolina Beach Music, having been born in Charleston, SC, and spent a great deal of my time growing up doing the Shag in the sand and salt air of Myrtle Beach, SC. I did have the pleasure of seeing Shag: the Movie, and I found it to be great fun to watch. In fact, it's one of my favorites.I, too, noticed that many of the ""really good"" songs were not included on the album, and that many more were not original recordings. But I also take into consideration the entire scope of ""the Wonderful World of Beach Music"" and know that most beach music songs HAVE at one point or another been remade. So as long as it still sets me to 'finger tappin' and stompin' feet,''Then I've got to say 'It's Alright!'And by the way, for the gentleman who inquired about the song that the contestants dance to in the Shag competition, the name of the song is ""It Will Stand."""
2,Not songs from Movie on VHS,"As others have noted, these songs on the soundtrack are NOT in the VHS version of the Movie. Here's what I could tell IS in the VHS version (not in chron. order):* Momma said there'd be days like this - Shirelles* Stay - M. Williams & Zodiacs* Monkey Time - Major Lance* Ooh Aah - Jakki 0* It will stand - The Showmen (played several times in movie; some by the ""house"" band Big Dan and the Sand Dollars -- Actually the Voltage Bros. who played the college/fraternity scene in the 1970s.)* Stagger Lee - Lloyd Price? or tbd.* Easier said than done - The Essex* Baby work it out - Jackie Wilson* Since I don't have you - the Skyliners* Sixty-Minute Man - Billy Ward (and the Dominos?) ""sung"" by house band in the movie.* Another Sat. Night - Sam Cooke* He's so fine - Chiffons ?* 39-21-40 Shape - Showmen ?* Up on the roof & Under the Boardwalk - Drifters* Blue Hawaii - Elvis* He's the one (easier said than done) - TBD* Alley Oop -- tbd* You belong to me -- Tbd"
2,I was very disapointed with this soundtrack,"When I first saw the movie SHAG, I fell in love with the 60's music that was played and made an immense effort to go to the store and purchase the soundtrack. Much to my dismay, the soundtrack lacked the songs I had come to buy. Such songs as ""Mama Said"", and ""60 minute man"" failed to be on the soundtrack. With these few songs, I think many more copies would be sold. How could such a brilliantly composed movie fail to include its masterpieces on the soundtrack? I don't know!"
2,Very un-shagadelic,"I adore ""Shag - The Movie,"" and since the video in current release has a completely different soundtrack than the original (has anyone else noticed this?) I decided to buy the soundtrack. Not cool at all. They chose the weakest songs from the film, some of which I don't remember, and practically bored me to sleep. The biggest mistake? Not including Lloyd Price's ""Stagger Lee,"" the one song that made the movie, in my opinion. Who wouldn't want to relive Pudge and Chip's trophy-winning shag by playing this song over and over? I know I did. How sacreligious."
1,"I loved the Movie, but the soundtrack? No WAY!","Ok, this is not the original soundtrack, which i was very disappointed in. I mean, why make a soundtrack of an awesome movie, if you're not going to put the songs that are IN THE MOVIE on the soundtrack??? This is a bad one..."
2,reply to question from the CT music fan,"the title of the song playing in the scenes with chip and pudge and carson and buzz is called ""ooh ahh"" and the artist isJakki O. I was also disappointed in the album. So, I waited for the end credits of the movie to find the songs that were really the best part of the movie like ""stagger lee"" by lloyd price and ""since i don't have you"" by the skyliners. good stuff!"
2,Truly Shagadelic?,"I have to say this album extremely disappoints me. I am a huge Shag fan, but only because the music makes the movie! Shag's essence is music, it is its anthem, its message, its spirit. The song ""Stagger Lee,"" makes the entire film and is not included in the album! Many others were not included in the record such as ""Easier Said Than Done,"" ""Ooh Ah,"" ""Sixty-Minute Man"" and ""Jungle Jive."" I must say for such a great film, the album falls short of the mark."
2,I found the Ooo Aaah song,"Go into Kazaa and click on audio search. Click the title button and type in ""shag"". One of the choices says shag soundtrack ""ooh aah"" song. That is where its at!!"
5,mental comfort,"If you are looking for a good album to work to or just sit back and veg out with this is it. Beautiful flute and great guitar music. Plus this band knows how to enjoy themselves and not get too caught up in commercial things. Shoe shuffle is great fun as well as the message that comes across in the ""fashion song"" lyrics like ""who could stretch it less only some impoverished pest"" a great statement about americans high priced new age health, fashion and brandname obsession. A broad range of music from beautiful ballads to white rap. They really make me wanna hug a tree!!!"
3,"Cute item, but low quality","This condiment set is adorable and just what I was looking for to spruce up my family picnics. I received this item in a timely fashion and it was packaged well. As cute as this item is, you can definitely tell it's a low quality product. The utensils pictured on the side of the set are a cheap material and the paint job is absolutely terrible. I had to use touch up paint on all of the utensils to make the set look presentable. This item was definitely overpriced considering the poor quality. The set is not very sturdy and shouldn't have cost more than $10."
1,Heater cooked fish,"Heater worked for about 2 months, then it simply stayed in the ""on"" position and before I could notice it had raised the tank 6 degrees! I never could get it to turn off again. Very dissapointed."
2,Beware,"This heater worked well for a time. However, after several months of use, it failed. As with what happened to another reviewer, when it failed, it locked in the on position. I believe the thermometer read about 100 degrees when I discovered it. All the fish in the tank but one died.The temperature was set when it was first installed and never touched thereafter. I've had submersible heaters before and since, and I've never had one fail like that."
5,Great book for new mom too,This book is a great resource for anyone caring for sick relative or a new mom with sick children. The recipes are simple but nuorishing. Well woth the money. A great addition to any cookbook collection.
5,great protection,I really like this product is saves so much space to just file the negs in a binder instead of having them lay around in their origanal processing packages. I will definately be buying more 100 was only a small start to organizing
4,Nice pages; a little tight,"These are strong, soft plastic. Inserting the negatives is more difficult than with some other brands - I guess this means they won't slip out. Best to put the page onto a flat surface while inserting negatives."
3,Flimsy but serviceable,"These storage pages are very flimsy. I have had curled negatives tear them. For cost per strip this is the best I've found. If you have strips cut into groups of 4 exposures, century photo makes a much nicer product that holds 9 strips, and is much thicker and tougher, but of course costs more. P/N PP100561PK (it was hard for me to find on their website)."
5,Need Inspiration?,"I found this DVD very inspirational and couldnt wait to go do some intervals after watching it. It is never going to win an academy award and might bore non-runners, but if you appreciate athletics and the mystique surrounding the 4 min mile, check it out-- it is definitely worth your time."
4,The good and the bad.....,"I purchased this to replace an Oxo spoon left too close to the burner of my stove (Yes, non-stick utensils do melt!). I like the slight 'tilt' of the bowl. The bowl itself is not as large as the Oxo; hence, the 4-star rating. About pricing: Amazon claims a saving; however, the retail price of $4.99 was clearly labled on the packaging. No complaints, however since shipping was free."
5,Quality stuff,"I got these to have some notebooks that weren't white plastic and these are very nice, at a reasonable price."
4,"Hella Good, Dude","Dude, this movie, its like, cool, dude. Like, This movie sucks... when hell F@#$in freezes over!! And as long as hell boy is here, i dont think you could get even an ice cube in there. Action, yes all the action you could ask for. But whats more... theres a little beauty and the beast romance in it too. But i wont ruin it for yea so you'll know what im talking about when you see it. Hell boy and his fish man friend are like the new batman and robin, the new super man and... fish boy. you get the point"
3,Fun Romp...What's With The Hit/Miss FX???,"Good story if you can get past the crappy beginning. The FX are awesome in most scenes and then seem trivial and pathetic in others. Don't get me wrong, overall I liked the movie. A great comic adaptation, but the average viewier is going to be picking this thing apart. Okay...you like comics??? RENT, do not buy this movie. After you see what it offers, make your buying decision. Personally, the dialogue and creaive charaters (except the main crappy villian) kept me interested enough to RENT a sequel. It's sad that SO MUCH good movie was damaged by bits and pieces of bad...Still, worth the rental."
3,It is not bad........it's also not great,"I guess I liked this movie but I don't want to see it again. I'm going to warn you that this has more talking than it does action which got me because I was expecting action, but it was good. Don't think this doesn't have any action, it has action and it is incredible because of the visual effects. I would really give this 2 and a half stars because I liked half of the movie. It's like the X-Men movies, admit they're kind of boring but you have to admit that they're kind of interesting at the same time. I'm saying that if you really want to see or kind of want to see it then see it but if you don't want to see it than you probably shouldn't see it. I think you'll think of it like my title: It is not bad......It's also not great. This is kind of what most of the critics are saying: it has more good than bad and some just don't like it. So enjoy it or don't enjoy it."
2,A hero is only as effective as the villain.,"Hellboy is a well directed and visually impressive film. My problems with it lie in the antagonist. He just isn't interesting. He is evil for the pure sake of being evil. Most of the creatures that Hellboy battles with are strange looking octopus creatures. It's hard to connect to the battles when the enemies just aren't engaging enough. They seem like rejects from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. And the final battle consists of Hellboy fighting a large cgi octopus. The best villains are those that don't believe they are evil but feel that they are justified in their actions. They also need to be organic in my opinion. The sequel, The Golden Army is much better in that the villain feels his actions are for the benefit of the world that he occupies. Hellboy is a decent movie, but for me personally, it doesn't hold up to repeat viewings."
1,Beyond Terrible,"Quite simply, one of the worst movies I have ever had the unfortunate luck to sit through. There are always loyal fans for every possible movie, however, this is so bad, that for those of us just looking for a good casual movie to view on a lazy Saturday night I felt compelled to write this to keep people from wasting time they can never get back."
1,didnt even finish it,"well, the title of my review is self explanatory. if your so dumb that you cant understand it, it sucked."
5,amazing a must have for cinema lovers,"The movie is superb, is the best adaptation from comic book to silver screen, for those who are hellboy readers they can appreciate that the dialogues, the rhythm and most of all the essence of mignola style is on the screen, Hellboy is a success, the most loyal and precise translation from a comic book ever and is also amazing how DEL TORO managed to tell a long story in so little time, and for the ones that like some more the directors cut is coming in november.The quality of the image is great, the audio is awesome and the dvd is loaded with a lots of extras, is perhaps the most complete making of in the dvd history only matched by the criterion collection and Lord of the rings extended editions dvds. I'm waiting impatiently for the directors cut dvd and the second movie."
3,"Great Acting, Lousy Story","How many times do you come away from an action movie (and one based on a comic book series no less) remembering the characterizations more than anything else? This was the case for me in watching ""Hellboy."" I was totally impressed with Ron Perlman's dry as vermouth performance,and that alone elevates this film above your standard comic book to screen adaptation. Unfortunately, the story is so uninvolving that it never puts the characters in situations that really engage the viewer,so the acting talent much of the time feels wasted.This film looks great, too, but come on, by now don't all Hollywood action films look pretty good, and shouldn't they, given the amount of money thrown at them. No, the makers of ""Hellboy"" have all the ingredients for a spicy, rich, delicious stew but only manage to muster up a mediocre broth that needs a lot of salt.Grade: B-"
4,Very good...,"I'm not that familiar with the Hellboy comics being a MASSIVE Marvel fan myself, but i did think this movie was really well shot in terms of it being based on a comic book. Now it might just be me, but when i see a movie based on a comic, i want it to scan on film like i'm reading the book. This movie achives this in dramatic fashion. I really enjoyed sitting and watching as each scene was like looking at a different panel on the page. Very good over all... enjoy!"
5,sci-fi,i enjoyed this action filled farce mainly because i am a fan of william hoylands. it will sure keep you awake.
2,Not a COMPLETE waste of time,"(...)The dialogue was stupid and the ending was just so overused that I wanted to throw something at the screen. But, overall, the movie was just boring. They tried really really hard. The special effects were top-notch, the cast was generally good (although their talents weren't used very well), and they at least tried to have a underlying moral message at the end. But the plot wasn't, well, INTERESTING enough.There's some action, a love story, and the average joe will probably be entertained enough to spend the $8-10. The violence isn't too bad for younger kids, and most teenagers will probably get a kick out of the action sequences. Adults might appreciate some of the humor (though it is used sparingly and not always with success). Just don't expect X-Men or Spiderman."
2,See this movie only if you don't care about a plot,"The movie starts out reminiscent of Raiders of the Lost Ark, but without the charm of Harrison Ford and Karen Allen. After the first 30 minutes, it degenerates into endless silly monster fight scenes. Overall, typical of action movies lately, all special effects and 15 minutes worth of plot spread out over 2 1/2 hours. Tedious, noisy, barely worth watching on cable"
4,Hella Good,"Wildly gothic and imaginative, Hellboy simply put is one hell of a good movie. In the era that very few comic book films live up to their colorful pedigrees, Hellboy fleshes out what the comic created, creating a cinematic experience that is not only action packed, but startingly human as well. Centering all of this magic is an incredable performance by Ron Pearlman as the title character. Hellboy is certainly no one's first image of a hero, more of a tragic anti-hero who is just doing the job that he feels he was put on Earth to do. But with Pearlman's excellent rendition, he gives Hellboy a heart and provides many humourous and human moments. The special effects and make up effects are top notch and the action scenes are destructive and large scale. But, in the end, it is the story and characters that win us over. An extremely rare feat in a summer film, or plain action films in general."
4,Like action? Like Comics? Like Blu Ray? You'll like Hellboy!,"I'm a action fan, and I love comics and comic movies. Hellboy is a great action comic movie in my opinion. Awesome special effects and cinemetogrophy (bad spelling). The plot is somewhat shallow, but there is a very cool villian and a good supporting cast helping Hellboy along the way. If it had a better plot, I'd probably give it 5 stars.The BluRay Transfer is great! Looks and sounds amazing on a 1080P TV. Better transfer than a lot of the others."
4,"Hellboy, what a surprise","I thought Hellboy was very good and you can""t say enough about Ron Perlman's portrayal. He was great! With an excellent supporting cast John Hurt, Selma Blair, Ruppert Evans and Jeffrey Tambourn, it all just worked. Guillermo del Toro really made the concept of Hellboy work and there was never a dull moment. Can't wait for 2."
3,x-men meets men in black,"mildly entertaining, but not in the same league as Spiderman and X-men. Hellboy has some amusing quips as he battles the bad guys, but this is a superficial movie unlike the previously mentioned movies. Although Hellboy gets knocked around, there is never any doubt he will prevail. Also, not much original here as the title suggests this is just a mix of the X-Men and Men in Black. Worth a rent, but not a buy."
3,"Entertaining, but a bit overblown","My wife and I both enjoyed watching ""Hellboy"" on DVD, even though it was confusing in places and went on a bit too long. Ron Perlman does a good job making Hellboy an interesting, even sympathetic, character, but there are too many balls in the air most of the time. The attempt to tie in every baddie of the 20th century, from Rasputin to the Nazis, seems forced.... and who built the huge, elaborate, gear-filled labyrinth under the mausoleum? Lots of unanswered questions of this type. But if you're willing to go along for the ride, it's entertaining enough. (We got an extra kick out of hearing David Hyde Pierce as the voice of Abe Sapiens!)"
4,one of the greats,"it has a little bit of everything the action, suspense, a little horror, and a little comedy everything it takes to make a great movie which is what it is a great movie. that is my opinion."
3,Hey Stinky!!!!,"I liked this movie. I never read the graphic novels or anything so I didn't know the story but when I first saw the trailer I thought... this looks cool. I wasn't wrong. I thought Ron Pearlman was perfect as Big Red and the cast was really good. Even Selma Blair who I think is a weak actress was good. John Hurt was excellent as usual.As far as the plot goes it was a bit weak in some spots but it was fun. I liked the whole premise of Hellboy. The Rasputin stuff was good and the villians were excellent. I just wish they would have concentrated more on the Nazi villians (Rasputin, his female stooge and the Nazi guy with the blades... he was cool). They kind of had too much of Hellboy battling the 'hounds of hell' thing too much. But it was still entertaining and fun and had a lot of good puns and humor. I liked the triangle between Hellboy, Liz and the young FBI guy.Fun flick and worth buying."
5,One of the best looking blu ray discs out there - and a good movie,"I love Hellboy. I have it on dvd. But this blu-ray is how it needs to be seen. The picture is stunning. I would call this blu-ray ""demo quality"". If you want to show off your high def set up, pop this blu-ray disc in. The sound is great too. But man, that picture. If you are a fan of this film and have it on dvd, and have a hi def blu-ray set up but aren't sure you want to buy this movie again... don't worry, it's worth it."
2,Lazy Blu-Ray release.,"I really like this movie. I enjoy every Del Toro film there is, he can do no wrong by me. This blu-ray is o.k. The picture quality is not the best, there was some color banding. Features weren't impressive at all, especially if you've already owned the special special edition of the DVD. Considering the capacity of these discs, I would of really liked to have seen the original cut of the film on there as well as the Gerald Mc Boing Boing shorts from the first DVD release. At the end of the day, if you don't mind the premium cost of owning a Blu-Ray, it is worth owning to watch any Del Toro film in HD. However, that's no excuse for a lazy, substandard, and costly product."
4,Good movie made better in Blu,"While not one of my favorite movies I do like the movie and story line (although the whole good guy against an occult infatuated nazi bad guy is quite re-used in hollywood) and find it fun to watch from time to time therefore a good addition to the blu collection. I had the DVD and have to say the transfer to Blu is SOOO much sharper and crisper then the DVD.Quick reply to the donk who claimed blu-ray wouldn't be around much longer... (Blue ray to bad, Updated, December 26, 2007 By Robert J. Talbot) I saw a Betamax player on Craigslist that you might be interested in..."
3,Cool...fun...and Amazing,The film was okay but good at the same time. It's hard to decipher by what i mean. You must rent the movie first to judge it yourself. It could have been better. Still Fun to watch..and cool
5,Oh Yeah!!,"Yes, finally a good movie out there like Spiderman 2. Hellboy is a movie that cannot be missed because it has every good ingredient that a movie needs to have in order to be great. This movie has action beyond anyone's wildest dreams and it has love, awesome costumes, and a totally great script. It is one of the greatest movie ever made and I give it 10 stars! See it!"
1,Dumbest I've ever seen!,"Can't believe I wasted time watching this schlock! The commercial was intriguing, and that was what brought me in. When will I learn? Cheap, and I mean CHEAP special effects, and the thinnest (literally a comic book) script. For action you can do better, and for special effects there's much better done before and after. Stay away from this waste of intelligence, money and time."
1,Boring...,"IMO, this film is like X-man and Spiderman but this one is not as successful as the other two. The story is neither attractive nor novel. The acting is boring and no character is really outstanding or special. I can hardly watch this film from the beginning to the end at once. I don't recommend this film to anyone."
3,Ron Perlman scores as Hellboy.....a great ride,"Hellboy is directed by Guiellrmo Del Toro(Mimic and Blade 2) and stars Ron Perlman(Blade 2, Star Trek:Nemesis), Selma Blair(Storytelling, Kill Me Later), Karl Roden(Bulletproof Monk, Blade 2) and Jeffrey Tambor(Teaching Mrs. Tingle, The Grinch2001). The movie is a great ride with Ron Perlman as a fantastic Hellboy giving off 100%. To me though I think the end kinda wore it down a bit but other then that it was one hell of a trip. The higlight is where Hellboy is stalking down Selma Blair's character who's with FBI guy John Myers and the little kid is giving Hellboy advice on girls."
2,What can you expect?...,"I have to admit, I went into the theater skeptical. And I will also admit that it was better than I expected it to be, but it's plot was severely weak. The whole seven gods of choas locked in crystal and the keys and random freaks were all rather confusing and silly. And the best character, ""Abe,"" did not even get into any action after the first half of the movie, which was a great disappointment. If you're planning on going to see it, just save your money and rent it from blockbusters or something...trust me."
3,"Ok but not a ""keeper""","HELLBOY features great cinematography and film-making elements and has a GREAT first 30 minutes.... but after that it just sort of plods along as a half-hearted mix of comedy, drama, lovestory, hero comic story.I was not familair with the cult popularity of the HELLBOY comic before this movie.In general I don't like the way Hollywood throws so much COMEDY into hero movies.I would like to see a ""comedy free"" Hero adaption one day.It seems Hollywood likes to toss comedy into every type of movie these days... Horror, Action, Hero, etc...It's a good rental and is better than many films these days.I respect the work and effort that went into making the film, BUT I will probably never watch it again or add it to my permanent DVD collection.It just didn't grab me enough to watch again or to remember."
2,Hellboy- Not worthy to be shown in hell,"Recently a lot of movies have been made or are being made based on classic comic book characters. My brother and I, being comic book fanatics when we were younger, went into this movie hoping to find another entertaining adaption of a cult classic. Unfortunatley, instead we walked out realizing we had just lost an hour and a half of our lives. Despite the excellent effects, the movie lacked to entertain. The dialogue reminded me of those cheezy ""bad movie"" stereotypes. I felt like I was watching a Saturday Night Live skit. The plot and casting I felt portrayed the comic book well, but the deliverance of it was not even decent enough to be put on televison. BEWARE! Do not waste your money or your time on this boxoffice junk, unless you feel like making your own version of Mystery Science Theater."
4,truster38 = moron,"ahhh ... truster38 if you would watch the DVD and the extras you would see the the ""squid things"" (as you sooo intelligently note them as and not by their real name) were not CGI but an extremely well done REAL LIFE MODEL made for the movie. Not surprised you share the same view as that other idiot Roeper who would not even know a good movie if it slapped him in the face and bought him dinner afterwards.Do everyone a favor on this site next time -- know the facts before you run at the mouth with no knowledege of your stated subject.Have a nice day."
