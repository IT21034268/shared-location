4,The Sandman: Preludes and Nocturnes,"Well, this wasn't the first ""Sandman"" volume I had read, although I should've (the first one I read was ""Season of Mists"" or volume 4). Of course it's important, since it establishes Dream as the protagonist and all that, but it's not my favorite.Personally, the artwork is iffy and is not my thing (Dream looks oooold). The stories are entertaining and well thought out, but a bit too jumpy (this is because Gaiman was experimenting with styles at the time). The later volumes are much more cohesive and, I think, of better quality.Still, any fan of the series needs the first volume, especially because in ""The Sandman"" the story comes full circle at the end, and skipping almost any part of it would leave you hanging.And it's still a good read, regardless of art or style or whatever :)"
5,enter a different world,"It's hard to review just one book of the series 'cause they are part of a larger story. Gaiman uses fables and myths and converts them to a modern story which at the same time feels like a ancient fary tale. If you have the chance watch Neverwhere, it's a BBC series about a world below modern Londen."
5,I adore this,"This series is one of a kind, and this compilation certainly does it justice, as well as helps me out tremendously in collecting all the issues."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"Don't get me wrong, Gaiman is one of the best writers alive. Most of the Sandman comic books are better written then most ""serious"" literature. This one is a tad disappointing, at least compared to the other comics. Still, you might as well begin here."
4,The Sound of Wings,"If this book only contained Issue #8, it would still be a must-have for Sandman fans. I refuse to give out ANY spoilers, and I would advise everyone out there who hasn't read Sandman to avoid seeing any. Let yourself be surprised. You deserve it.Okay, Preludes isn't as strong as some others, yada yada yada - SO WHAT? It's Sandman. It's the first issue. You have to read it, and you can't have a complete collection without it.I just finished reading World's End, and the last panel of issue 8 remains the defining image of the Sandman for me. There is a lot of powerful stuff in here, and I would suggest it to anyone who genuinely loves comics, mythology, or intelligent writing."
4,ignore the review below,this is the first 8 issues of the series. it is the starting point of all this... it also contains the sound of her wings. issue #8.which is the first appearance of death. and many peoples favorite issue.its not the best of the collected works. but its the start of them.
4,A Tantalizing Beginning...,"While even Gaiman admits that this first volume isn't his best work (some early ideas fall slightly flat...e.g. a little too much intrusion from the DC Universe), it remains a very good taste of the greatness to come in later Sandman collections. This as they say, is where it all begins. Recurring themes are introduced, character nuance is hammered out, and if you've never read Gaiman before...you will have your first experience with his tight plotlines, and clever storytelling. At its worst, Preludes & Nocturnes is still very enjoyable. At its best, it will remind you of why you love comics in the first place. By the time you reach the final chapter (arguably the best in the volume), you will be definitely be hungry for more Sandman. If you are curious about the whole Sandman fan frenzy...or simply eager to experience a truly unique comic, this is the best place to start."
2,Bad introduction to Sandman,"I had a hard time getting through this graphic novel. I found the stories to be completely disjointed and character development to be almost nonexistent. I only gave it the second star for the hell scene which is great (and which is only about 20 pages of the book). I only continued on with the series because I had already purchased volumes 2, 3 and 4 for a graphic novel class.I just started Vol. two last night and am almost done with it. It's fantastic! Volume 1 took me about 6 days to get through as I could only read a small portion of the book before getting bored. Volume two, I don't want to put down. I highly recommend that those unimpressed by Sandman Vol. 1 give the second volume a chance."
1,Sandmand is silly and pretensious,The author dwells in a world of silly feelings that a healthy individual will not be able to relate to. This whole series is nothing but immaturity disguised as intellectual deep stuff. Stay away from it.
3,Rough Starts,"Neil Gaiman introduces his spiritual entity of Dream aka ""The Sandman"" in this first of ten volumes. Gaiman himself admits to not feeling comfortable with the series until the last issue in the trade and it truly shows. Although decent and well written the beginning to this acclaimed series falls short of the expectations set by the following stories. However, this volume does set up others in the series well and I couldn't recommend skipping it."
5,No.,Read it your damned self.Why are you still reading the damned reviews.Really seven more words? Go read it.
4,Descubriendo The Sandman,"La calidad del papel es buena, la tapa es a todo color, pero blanda. Una encuadernación más sofisticada me hubiera gustado mas, pero seguramente hubiese encarecido el producto. Son 233 páginas y ya voy mas de la mitad con sólo unos días de recibirlo. Me gusta la trama de la historia, me lo compré por curiosidad aunque no soy aficionada a los comics y a veces las viñetas me marean un poco, pero si fuera una película, sería un excelente guión. El protagonista tiene esa forma de hablar elocuente y misteriosa...cada tanto dice alguna que otra frase memorable, cargada de ironía y un humor peculiar. Entiendo ahora por qué sirvió de inspiración a Eric Kripke..."
4,perfect intro,this is a great intro into the rest of neil gaiman's sandman series. it's probably just me but dr.destiney is realy funny. The part with the kids show in the cafe is hilarious. also he is so funny in the way he stands in the middle of the road with a gun to get a ride.
4,A good beginning,"So...we have dream, who has been held captive for about 60 years. We meet death, a punky, cute teenage girl. Dream seems quite appropriate, the younger brother of the nameless. I've heard so many good things about the series I decided to start it. I'm pumped for the rest and the artwork really is terrific and Gaiman's ideas are stunning. What a fabulous writer (see American Gods)."
4,Excellent on Fire HD 8.9,"I thoroughly enjoy graphic novels but never purchased a Kindle version. With the acquisition of the Fire HD 8.9, graphic novels looked more attractive. I purchased this one and am VERY pleased. As budget allows I will be adding all the Sandman novels.If you are not familiar with Neil Gaiman's SANDMAN series, I can only say that it is an extraordinarily imaginative tale. Enjoy."
4,"Works well, a little stiff","It does what it is supposed to do very well, but the connectors are stiff and you have to use a lot of force to plug your cords into it."
3,Mono Adapter; Not Stereo,"I bought this product for my PS3 so I could use my STEREO Headset. Works great if you want the Mono audio settings, but personally for me I wanted Stereo. So I messed up my order and didn't get what I wanted. So if you're buying for PS3 or 360, Pick up a Stereo adapter, not Mono. I bought the wrong product and I'll have to pick up another stereo adapter."
1,"Cheap, didn't work until I took it apart and fixed it","The title pretty much says it all. When the adapter arrived, I could not plug the 3.5mm jack into it, I could see that something inside was mis-aligned.So I took it apart, bent and stretched things, put it back together and now it works. Would have rather it just worked out of the box, but you get what you pay for, right?"
5,Works like a charm,Very simple and cost effective solution. Have not had a problem with it using it for over a year now. Highly Recommended
1,"Never worked properly, then completely broke after a few months","From the day I bought this, It only sent sound to one speaker/headphone earbud. I just learned to deal with it, but then after a couple months it stopped working all together. Out of frustration I pried it all apart and saw it is not made very well. Very thin wires completely submerged into a solid plastic mold. The slightest shift and the wires could break, which they did on mine. I highly suggest the similar 3.5 female to RCA females adapter that is 6"" long available on amazon. Much more practical design and I've had no issues. I use these with laptop speakers and headphones on a PS3."
1,defective,"The product I got does not work. you have to jam the 3.5mm plug in and even then it puts out sound that is can barely be heard. you have to press and hold the jack in a half out and bent way for there to be some sound, even with the speakers on max volume, the other reviews say it works well, however it seems i just got a faulty product and i do not want to ship it back and wait for them to ship me another one if there's a good chance that it will probably be faulty."
1,horrible buzzing,"The item has a horrible huzzing noise and after leaving a 3/5 review I was contacted by the seller. They said they would refund my total price if I removed my feedback! HAHAHAHA! nope, feedback is here for a reason. This company has sketchy tactics."
4,Works well with PS3 and computer speakers/PC headphones,"I purchased this to get sound on my computer speakers while playing my PS3. It works well, but does require you to firmly push the 3.5mm in for both speakers to output sound, otherwise it only goes in partially and you get sound out of one speaker."
5,Did it what it says it does,Not much you can say about this product expect that it works awesome as intended and definitely works for consoles.
3,Female to 2 female adapters,"Hook up is easy, size is acceptable, the picture once split needs to be amplified to keep it clear and sharp."
5,Using Adapters to cast on JTV,YO WIILUIGI CHECK OUT MY REVIEW .Great deal for 2 but i would recommend getting 3 for all the colors. overall 5 stars worked great for splitting with my rca cables.
2,Confused..,"I bought it to connect my PS3 with my computer desk speakers and I'm pretty sure I have it hooked up correctly, yet the left speaker is the only one producing audio.. Not sure if mine has a defect, but I can live with it. Still, if anyone would be so kind as to help me fix this, please do send a message my way. Thanks. :)"
1,Wow! Such a bad seller!,"Hello, I bought this to hook up my PS3 to my LCD because I bought my son a huge computer monitor so that he could play on it rather than the big screen in the living room where I watch my satellite. He loved the idea! So I put in an order for this and paid for expedited shipping. Expedited is supposed to be 1-3 days. Its almost been a full week (7 days) and the product has not arrived. This has been a waste of time for me and my son. Went to the store and just bought one of these that had good quality for $17. Price really doesn't matter at all when your son's not happy. I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THESE PEOPLE AGAIN AND I ADVISE YOU TO DO THE SAME."
3,Only one side works!,"Shipping was fast, and packaging was in good condition.The only problem is that only one output works.I tried it with speakers and headphones, but i can only hear from one sideI contacted the seller. Im still waiting for a respond..."
3,It only came with one......,"It works as it's supposed to. but i only got one and the item said ""2 x"" but thats fine...."
1,Doesn't work for headsets properly,Bought this to work with my turtle beach headset for the ps3 - it will only play sound from one headphone.
4,Does what it should,"I ordered this based on its price, I was looking for a dirt cheap adapter and that is what this is.Pros: Works as stated, I get sound out of both channels (unlike many of the negative reviews)Cons: Nothing really wrong with it. Maybe they could add a little weight to it, it feels hollow and possibly weak if you were to beat it up.Other notes: I'm not sure if I just got lucky and received a working one but what I did notice is that to get the plug all the way in takes an extra push after the initial plug in to get it to snap all the way in and without that push I did only get 1 channel of audio. Possibly the neg reviews didn't try that and left an angry review on a cheap product.TL:DR. Get it if it is what you are looking for."
5,Works as intended :),"I ordered this expecting to take the RCA audio out from my PS3 and convert it into a 3.5mm headphone jack. It does just that! Make sure the red and white cords are plugged in and don't use the yellow. Also you must set the PS3 to output sound through all ports that are connected in the PS3 settings menu. If you don't do these things it won't work. I am very happy with my purchase since now I can play my PS3 on my TV or on my computer monitor, depending if the TV is available or not. THANKS!"
3,Not good sound quality,"The one I received was mono, as everyone, and after it being mono, I wasn't expecting such a bad audio quality from the speakers/headphones. By the way, I was using this converter with my xbox 360. And I already had a good set of 2.1 ch PC speakers. And I didn't wanna spend extra bucks for a new speaker set that work with the xbox. But this product led me buying the new set of speakers having RCA input. Sorry for a bad review, but giving 3 stars for its low price, and for those who just wants low quality sound for cheap."
1,manufacturer defect,Ordered this cable to replace another one I had but got lost in a move. I opened the package and tried to plug in the audio cables from a ps3 into the two RCA female ends but found that each hole was too small to fit the RCA male ends!! I tried fitting other RCA male cables into the purchased splitter and none would fit. The 3.55mm stereo female end fit with no problem with my stereo cable.
5,Received a stereo adapter!,"I hadn't been able to find this style of adapter in stereo, so thought mono monitoring would be OK. The adapter I received has a flush mount 3.5mm mini socket, not the raised socket shown. Surprise! It's a stereo output that works great with my headphones. Perfect."
5,Cheerful Butterflies & Blooms,"I love this book for its cheerful designs. I am a big fan of applique, flowers, animals and insects in wild. In this book I have found all four. The designs have movement and seem to come alive. I plan to use the patterns on quilts and tote bags. Thank you Carol!"
3,Excavator handbook,written for an operator of same mind as author.The books requires more graphics to better explain his practical description
5,World-Class Potty Humo(u)r,"My 7-year-old son & I read this book together in one sitting, and laughed practically the whole time! Roddy Doyle builds up great suspense, and Brian Ajhar's illustrations complement the text perfectly. Any fan of the Captain Underpants series should appreciate ""The Giggler Treatment."" Lots of great shock value, and some international culture, too! I'll be looking for more Roddy Doyle books."
1,Not funny at all,"... I believe adults would getmore of a kick out of this than kids, and I read about 100 children'sbooks a year and work with children and children's literature everyday. Don't bother recommending this one to kids."
4,Poo Happens!,"Very cute book, a fun read for a little kid. Cute pictures are nice too, I have the hardback version, nice cover."
5,Hilarious book for kids and grownups,"I read this with my children last summer, but 6 months later we are all still talking (and laughing) about it. While a story built around dog poo might not seem like quality literature in the making, this is truly one of the funniest, most inventive children's books I have ever read. A clever and witty tale - highly recommended."
1,poor job,"not worth the money i paid for it. the info is poorly presented, poor picture quality, simply put in 5 words : A Waste Of My Money"
4,Unique book,"This is a very cool book, but it really is not for the average joe. You get a parts list, and some limited instructions, and then a picture of how the project should look when it's like 75% done. It is hard to follow. From parts list to 3/4 done in a matter of like a page."
5,Gift for Brother,My brother had been looking for this book for some time when I found it on Amazon. I bought it quickly and he was delighted to recieve it for his birthday. The book was in the condition promised and arrived quickly.
5,Best ever tech manual!,"If you need to build a cool high tech device, chances are it's probably in this book. This is why I prefer this book over the others. A must for any do-it-yourself guy!"
2,Misleading!,"The product shows a picture of multiple cables and says ""cables"" (plural) in the listing - but you only get one cable for the $30 or so price tag. Pay very close attention when buying from this misleading ad."
3,They Work.,What to say about a rubber cable? The product worked. Never completely satisfied with handle construction. Most manufacturers tend to scrimp. This product satisfactory. Not sure of actual resistance pounds. I think exercise equipment is a touch and experience before purchase.
3,NOT WHAT I ORDERED,"""My received package provided by Banner Therapy (aka Therapy Best Buys) did not include the ""triple grip handles"" as noted on Amazon product page. Got instead the ""single cable"" handles. Called Banner, and was told that they no longer have the triple grip handles, and the info on the Amazon product page wrt the handles is no longer valid. Now they tell me!!! Allowed a full return; which I took."""
5,"terrance mckenna "" a true shaman """,terrance mckenna is one of the most revolutionary thinkers of our time. he is a true shaman. his video as well as his books will change the way you have looked at your very exsistence.for the person that is looking for truth i recomend this video highly. watch it and make your own decisions.peacefullness.
4,Rock & Roll,"New Band, 1st CD. We will be seeing/hearing alot from these guys. Buy this CD, you will enjoy. You will listen to it over and over and over and over again."
2,Not romantic,"I've read worse but this one made no sense. Why didn't he tell her what was going on? Why even pretend he was going to marry Paola? (BTW I love that name - Paola. Like something the mob would be handing out). And the main character, Clare, absolutely HATED Guido the whole book and they treated each other terribly and then - Poof!- they were in love and living happily ever after. Good sexual tension but no payoff (or Paola - LOL) till the very end and no romance in the book."
2,good enough though it wasnt really special.........,i like the plot but the story wasn't really that great. though the book wasnt that bad or anything.
1,Zero credibility,"How can anyone read ANYTHING by this guy? He is accused of producing child porn and of paying off sources to create a story. According to other posted sources he, using a pseudonym, is one of the ""readers"" writing rave reviews about his own books!! National Public Radio just did a piece called Sex, Checks and The New York Times and said, ""The story of Kurt Eichenwald and Justin Berry is sordid in every way."" I suggest reading more about the author, rather than reading this book."
3,Enough of Crooked Stock Brokers,"Enough of the likes of Darr and Harrison. This book jumped out at me and I instantly began to search the credibililty, honesty and background of my own stock broker. Have the financial houses no shame?"
3,Ok!,"I love Disney movies and I like Sleeping Beauty but it is not my favorite classic Disney movie, I prefer Snow White and Cinderella. I'm replacing some of my Disney videos to DVD but I don't think I will buy the DVD for Sleeping Beauty I think I will just buy DVDs for the movies that I would really watch more than once like Snow White, Cinderella, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, The Parent Trap, and Mary Poppins."
3,Old Style Book,"This is an inexpensive book (under $7) done in an old style, with 'Yankee Trader' sorts of line drawings. It has a nostalgic charm, but the small format, courier lettering and low quality graphics definitely make it a bit difficult to read.This was originally written in 1976, so at the time it might have been one of the only books available. In this age of many well done, professional quality winemaking books, there are many other options which are relatively inexpensive as well."
4,good game,This is a good game.. I only gave it 4 stars because you need to have at least 3 people to play the full version of the game. The rules for 2 people isn't as much fun. So if you have at least 3 people to play this is a great game.
3,Works but can't reinstall heat shield,"Works fine but after I had it installed in my 2001 Toyota Tundra, I found that There is no way to reinstall the small shield that protects the sensor. I may be able to take a dremel to it to widen the gap in the middle so it will slip back in but for now I've just left off the shield."
3,it works but not original OEM replacement,Unit works great. Easy to install. Only drawback is that I was not able to put back the original heat shield that protects the sensor back on since it would not fit the design of the neew sensor.
3,Had to Return... So Sad About it,These are so adorable! Love the pewter color and the foot bed fit perfectly! BUT the straps that go over the top of foot were way too tight! I have a high arch & was gravely disppointed to have to return these because they were exactly what I was looking for. Never have tried this brand before & I think it would have been a very comfortable shoe. : (
3,Play some more,"3 1/2While this disc of solo piano work comes and goes pretty quickly, the well endowed mood music it supplies during the brief duration makes it worthwhile. Of course it is hampered by a covers-centric theme, but Brubeck fleshes out routines by routinely putting his stamp of genius on top."
1,The absolute worst,Not one single decent track on here. Absolutely horrible. From back when electronic was first catching on and really really awful.
2,Disappointed,"We bought this tripod to use at shoots requiring a third camera after reading it's good reviews. Unfortunately the spreader broke while setting up the second time we used it! The tripod is also very heavy and not very user friendly.Manfrotto however were very quick to replace the broken item.We have always used Miller tripods in the past which have proved excellent, light and extremely strong. We now wish we had spent the extra money on another Miller tripod."
3,Not as pictured,The unit I received did not match the specifications for the unit pictured. If you actually need a diplexer that will pass signals in the 5 to 15 Mhz range you will be disappointed. Unit I received had a frequency range of 15 to 2500 Mhz. In my case it still worked but your mileage may be different.
4,Different,This isn't the typical Spawn book. It's more dark and violent than the others. Worth the time if you liked that aspect of the other Spawn books.
2,Not the best racing autobiography,Life in the Fast Lane was repetitive and self-serving. There was nothing new about the years with Ferrari. This Irvine fan was quite disappointed.
4,Awesome!!,"I love this video, short segments but great for the Butt!! after just a week of working out my Bf noticed and complemented me on my bootie:)"
3,I was disappointed because,"each session is too short and thought buying the dvd was a waste of money, that's why I don't change Gilad, he's never disappointing."
3,Too Short,I personal felt that the tape segments were too short to get a workout. Some were less than 10 minutes. Really? I didn't feel like you could get your heart rate up at all. I would say this is a warm up in anything. If you were able to choose a few segments together without a pause maybe that would help. I would save your money!
4,Great Results,"I'm a Jillian fan, I'd read reviews that a lot of Jillian fans were also Denise Austin fans.Wow is she energetic!!!My first mistake was attempting to do this right after Jillian Michaels Ripped in 30. I have been on a bit of a hiatus from working out so I am (or was at the time) out of shape. I really had to push through the first workout.Her workouts do remind me a lot of Jillian. I've only been doing this for a week but my fiance says he can already notice a difference.Overall I would recommend it. It's 10 minutes a day. Wake up 15 minutes earlier and pop this bad boy in. What do you have to lose? Weight! That's what."
4,BestBun&Leg,"I really like this video! It was easy but I can feel it kicken it. And I was actually sore in the morning, a good kind of sore !! LOL- I so recommend this!!"
1,"45 to assemble, 5 to stop working","You'd think that a product with ""Mattel"" and ""Hot Wheels"" on the box, you'd get quality. Nope. The track took nearly 45 minutes to assemble and that was mainly because the pieces didn't fit well at all. One piece cracked as it ""clicked"" into place as the instructions say. Once it was put together, the car was charged and rolled away on the track. It took two full charges to get it to go fast enough to make the jump and then it finally started zipping around the track... for about 60 seconds, maybe. After the fourth charge, it didn't go at all.Sum it up? Cheap plastic, ill fitting, short-lived junk. (Made in China in case you wonder...)I sure miss the nice durable toys of my youth!!! Hot Wheels was my favorite back then."
3,Lots of fun but...,"This is a great toy, but the only car that came with the set stopped working after just a few uses and it's very hard to find replacements: as of this writing Amazon wasn't selling individual cars, nor was even the Hot Wheels site. Very disappointing. Even if the one car worked, you would almost certainly want to be able to buy more cars to have an actual ""race"" correct??"
5,sew clothes that fit.,"This book is fabulous. I purchased it to replace a copy that I was borrowing and had to return. With this book, and a list of measurements of any person, I can create a garment that FITS on the first fitting with only minor adjustments. I have sewn for myself and others using this book. If you already know how to sew, and want to be able to make those clothes you would like, this book if for you. You work from measurements and draw your own patterns. The book shows the basic forms, and then shows how change the style.Easy to follow instructions for making the patterns. The sewing instructions are meant for someone who already knows the basics, so they may be a bit vague for a beginner."
5,Must have book,"I am not a standard size person, so I wanted to know if it was at all possible to create my very own ""master pattern"". Checked this book out from our University library and liked it so much I bought my own. The instructions seem straight forward enough, but have yet to actually try them on my own."
1,DISAPPOINTMENT,I have to say that I am very much disappointed in the quality of this toy. I'm surprised since it carries the Fisher Price name. My 4 year old doesn't really even enjoy it because she gets frustrated with it. The sound has alot of static. The songs are way to old for little kids. Whatever happend to real kid's music? The picture is okay...wasn't really expecting a great quality.
1,back to the shop,"I have already returned this toy to the store! Sure it's a toy and you don't expect it to be professional quality; however by the time you buy all the supplies for it, it gets rather expensive. the unit about $55 and each ROM $10 and batteries. My total refund for the unit and ROM was $160. For That price I think that the picture should be clear and our voices heard. I was very disappointed. Don't buy this toy."
1,Spend money on something (anything) else!,"Very poor quality. We could hear my son's voice on the microphone, but not the actual music or lyrics very well. Even with direct lighting, the image was horrible. We ended up returning the toy because the lens selector on the microphone was broken. We were not sad to part with this one.However, I do look forward to an improved version. It could be a lot of fun!"
2,Not as effective as it claims.,"This product claims to kill and repel adult fleas, eggs, and larvae. I don't recall the time frame, but I think it was up to 4 months.We had (still have) a moderate flea infestation in our home and on our dog. We bathed her, sprayed her, and thoroughly cleaned and sprayed the house. It seemed to be very effective and lasted for about 3 to 4 weeks. Then the fleas returned. We did a repeat bath, spray, and house cleaning, but it seems to have had no effect. We're now looking for alternate solutions. If this product really did what it claimed, the fleas would not have come back.If you're looking for a short term solution until you can find a better long term solution, then this product is decent and affordable in a pinch. If you're looking for long term solutions, look elsewhere. I'll probably end up having to break the bank for a monthly preventative like Frontline or Advantage."
3,Be careful when ordering this item.,"The item I received is not what is shown on the page. I wanted the one with Pyriproxyfen like is shown, but I got the one with Methoprene which does not work nearly as well. Not sure who is at fault here, does the company or Amazon put the picture? Anyway just a beware when buying."
1,Adams Flea & Tick Mist Plus,Sorry to say it didn't keep the fleas off and didn't even seem to kill the ones on my dog.
2,Doesn't work well...,"I was very disappointed with this product. I used it on all my animals, both dogs and cats. It did not work. The next day the fleas were just as bad as before and it didn't kill them off of the furniture either. Think I'll go back to Frontline. It does cost more but it works."
1,Scary side effects,"I used this product per the directions on my 14lb tabby and he had a terrible reaction to it. 15 minutes after applying it I came upstairs to find him drooling on my keyboard and looking disoriented. I immediately bathed him, however the symptoms persisted. The next morning he was switching between slightly dragging his hind legs and walking as if there were tape stuck to them. After a few days he seemed to recover, however I would never recommend Adams Plus Flea & Tick Mist With Insect Growth Regulator to anyone with a cat. This product with certainly kill the fleas, but it might kill your cat in the process. I threw my bottle in the garbage where it belonged and have had significantly better results with Bayer Advantage II for Cats."
1,Dont use!!!,"I used this product on my sons cat as preventive care. It was the first time that we had used this product and the smell was very strong. After spraying him he started drooling very badly, was very lethargic and couldn't seem to control his bladder. After consulting our vet, I washed him off in Dawn dishsoap but he is still fighting for his life. The vet said that we will just have to wait and see if he pulls thru. It did kill the fleas but it might also kill the cat. Please just get something else, dont take the risk."
2,Not really as advertised.,"This is in no way a subsitute for Frontline or the other expensive monthly flea treatments. I find it works when the spray directly hits a flea. That is it.When I had an infestation on the pit bull, it worked well due to his short coat, but I tried to use it on the cat... not only did she HATE that I was spraying something on her, it didn't seem to penetrate her coat, so the fleas were not effected.In no way do I believe the claim that it repels fleas. Thats BS."
4,Good overview of 20th C. designers,"Well written, from a personal viewpoint. Good photos, some I had not seen from these designers. That said, more time could have been given to each designer. But it is really just an introduction to the work of these designers. Recommended."
1,Avoid Product MADE IN CHINA!!!!,"Be Careful - We bought the juicy juice apple juice for our kids and saw in light ink the words 'product of china'. I will never buy apple juice from Nestle.I live in a Michigan where apples are exported and a top crop that support many people along with meeting all the FDA requirements. By the way are fresh and taste great. How does the economics support processing apples in China and sending them here to be cheaper then made down the road? Obviously, there is something wrong - I am not anti-globalization but seriously WTF."
1,Product of China,"Look carefully at the packaging in the store. Nestles' Juicy Juice is now a product of China: China where pesticides and chemicals banned in the U.S.A. are still used. China is a country that has sent us poison toohpaste and dog food and makes use of prison labor. From undermining breastfeeding worldwide, to the implicit condoning of slavery in the production of raw ingredients such as cocoa to importing juice of questionable safety into America, a nation awash in apples; there is no bottom for Nestle. I'd rather buy juice from British Petroleum - at least they don't use slave labor."
3,For Completists,"Please compare this track listing with the (American) Universal release selling for a *FRACTION* of the cost.Then listen to the samples and decide if you feel this way-too-short compilation is a worthy investment.For my money, I'd recommend the Deluxe Edition of ""Standing in the Shadows of Motown"" documentary double-CD for the second disc, ""From the Snakepit,"" recordings.Also worth tracking down are the Motown Karaoke recordings--some are too expensive and not as well-mixed. But stripped of the lead vocals, you can hear the Funk Brothers' background arrangements in much better detail. (I was especially impressed with the background harmonies of The Four Tops, often overlooked/underheard in the shadow of the late, great Levi Stubbs!)"
1,Doesn't work,"I used to install and repair waterbeds for a living. Recently my own waterbed sprung its first leak so I bought this product. It's terrible. I have patched my bed three times now, and I awoke this morning to it leaking once again. I'm throwing away the remaining product and am going to find what I used to use (Blue Magic if my memory serves me)."
1,Expensive and not helpful,"The packet says ""45 square patches"" but there were only 6. And it doesn't stick as well as I was hoping. I would never buy this product again."
1,water bed repair kit,the water bed repair kit did not supply large enoughed patches and those that came were already precut to a size that was too small sized to be useful I suggest that the water bed patchs not pre cut and only one sheet of patches were included essentially makes this product exprensive and not adequate to repair a larger leak in the mattress.
3,Waterbed Patch Kit,"Item wasn't what I was expecting. No picture was displayed, when ordering, so I wasn't expecting what I got. I was expecting the typical glue and patches, that I've always patched my water bed with, and the item I received was self adhesive patches."
2,Too heavy,"If you like heavy, good.If you have to carry the pedal anywhere, it is just too heavy.The versatility of the tuner is very nice, along with true bypass.But how many guitarists carry just a guitar and a tuner? What about effects, an amp, sheet music, etc. Each of these adds their weight. This one is too heavy. I prefer and own the pitchblack by Roland. Almost as good and less than half the weight (and not a lightweight at that).I would have bought this pedal if it was half the weight (still heavier than the typical BOSS stomp box)."
5,Wonderful!!!,"Simply wonderful. It's impossible not to feel and find the Chrismtas Spirit in this marvelous book. I was reminded that some of the most powerful and profound lessons and feelings in life are found at home with family and never more so than at Christmas time. I will buy this book for several family members as well as a couple friends and will read it every year as a reminder of goodness during a simpler, gentler time...and try to incorporate some of this goodness in my own life...a gentle reminder to slow down and take time for one another. The lesson? Think less of yourself and more of others."
5,Christmas Remembered,I was very pleased that I received it so soon. I was wondering if had made a good choice-YES I did.
4,HoHoHo,"A good read, but not a great as his ""The Land Remembers"". Tradition, what Christmas should be."
3,Good Music. Cheap Packaging,"The music on the CD is a small group session, in a bluesy, slightly funky style. The music is pretty good and fairly well recorded. Although it is listed as a Buddy Rich session, the drums are not prominently featured. Far more up front in the mix is an organist, possibly Jimmy McGriff, since one of the tracks is co-written by Buddy Rich and Jimmy McGriff. Sax and guitar are also featured more in the mix than the drums and some of the drumming, such as on ""Alright,"" is somewhat plodding. Overall, however, an enjoyable set. Approximately 35 minutes long. Loses a star due to the cheap packaging--generic black and white head shot of Buddy Rich on the cover. No information about when the session took place or who is playing. Generic bio of Buddy Rich is the only information provided."
4,no more fleas,"Bought this for my animals, This product works well, always trusted Adams, I have 2 small dogs and 1 cat. I bath them at least once evry 2 week if not more. Our newest dog, we found, and after bathing him we were finding fleas and ticks. Used the Adams shampoo solved our problem. But when using this product, I urge you to rinse your pets well. This product is strong and may cause side effect if you don't rinse thoroughly(pets tends to lick themselves). Buy, This product works for around 2 weeks before you have to rebath your pets. That's my review.lattiketpatan"
1,made my dog sick,"Would not use again. Almost lost my dog with this product, gave her a bad rash on underside. Thought it was mange mites, kept using product and made her vomit after use, losing weight just looking bad. Saw on news WXII CH 12 Winston Salem NC where people were having trouble using this product with d-limonene. Cost me alot in the long run trying to find problem. Headed to Walmart to get refund!"
1,Did nothing to kill the monster fleas of Summer 2011,The fleas are worse this year and even Frontline has had no effect. We bathed our cats using Adams and found active fleas all over them after the bath!
4,Refreshing Twist!!,Sex therapist and NFL player travel cross country to find NFL player's estranged wife only to uncover the particulars of her past which are not too flattering. Ms. Perrin has weaved together another page turner I'm sure you'll love.
4,Romance with mystery,or mystery with romance? Either one makes this a good book. I finished it in one day. I loved Lecia's and Tony's chemistry. Each just looking for someone to love them and not relive mistakes from their past. Pick it up...and enjoy their cross-country adventure.
3,"""Fools Rush In"" or should it be ""I'm Gonna Get You Sucka""","I ordered and read this one a litle late but still enjoyed it. Kayla Perrin always writes an intriguing story and this one did not disappoint. I was however, a little put out with how little Anthony new about his wife and couldn't for the life of me understand how a rich, intelligent man marries someone and not know a thing about her past or her family. This of course almost leads to his downfall. As with any good love story, the help and love of Lecia's character results in a happy ending. What more could you ask for....."
5,Attention Corvette enthusiasts!,"For those of you who own a Corvette, or are fascinated by this legendary sports car icon, this is a dynamic book including the history and sensational pictures of the mid-year models. It was a great addition to my collection and offers information not included in many other sources. A good one to leave on the coffee table when the friends come over!"
3,It was alright,"I ordered this for my friend who has gotten very into crocheting in the last year or so. When I asked her about it she said that it was great but the directions for Eyore which she is making now is a little hard to follow. It is missing one of the beginning directions. It is better than any of the directions she found online however. She is having someone else who knows how to crochet help her. Hopefully she will figure it out. It does have complete instructions, for the most part, for all of the characters like piglet, pooh, and tigger. It is better than anything you will find for free online. I would only recommend this product to someone who knows how to crochet well and is not to a beginner."
5,Pooh & Friends Rock,"I was very happily surprised when I received this book. It was everything I was looking for. Haven't had time to use it yet, but it is on my ""bucket"" list."
5,"Excellent product, excellent customer service","Despite the fact that the estimated delivery screen indicated that his product would arrive in over a little over a week, the product actually arrived within just a few days. The product is nice. The customer service for this company is excellent."
1,Gag Me with a Spoon,"Fly Me to the Moon, yeah, sure, The worst album of all time. The poor Sinatra family to have their father's music desecrated like this! Even the hair cut on the album cover doesn't make up for the hatchet job on the inside. Pipe this into the prisoners at GitMo and they'll talk (or commit suicide). A true WMD! (This is my 1st review of an album on Amazon I was compelled to write by an overwheming sense of concern for humanity. Maybe if I can prevent one person from drinking too much or over dosing on drugs as a result of listening to this album it will be worth it!) I've noticed a number of 5 star reviews since I first reviewed this album back in June and, well, I smell a mule in the stall, so to speak, does this guy really have that many relatives or is it a desperate housewife thing. You know how drinking Budweiser gives you gas? Well I get it from listening to this cd!"
4,Glad he's 'back' :-),"I'm glad that Michael has finally released another album. I was hoping it would be new music, but I'll take this over nothing at all.As long as he doesn't over do it, he really can sing. He's sometimes a bit like a male Mariah in the respect that they both use a lot of vocal gymnastics. The only song he's done that on is My Funny Valentine (would have been a favourite otherwise). Other than that one bad performance, the standout songs are Fly Me To The Moon, Summer Wind, Girl From Ipanema and the hit of all hits, New York, New York. He really has done an excellent job to cover a talent like Frank Sinatra. I think Frank would be proud of this. If you are a fan of either great singer, then this is for you. Overall, it won't let you down - I love it."
3,Makes me appreciate Frank more.,"I'm a Bolton fan, but doing Sinatra is a mistake for him, as it was for Rod Stewart. The title, ""...Swings Sinatra"" is insulting...SINATRA swung Sinatra, for God's sake. If anything, it swings quite a bit -less- than it did in the first place. Some styles aren't meant to be combined: As Aretha awkwardly inflicted her soul riffing into Italian opera, Bolton does the same to standards. Standards,(and opera), have a fully developed aesthetic of improvisational possibilities. Artists must learn the riffs -already- available to them before they try to ""update"" the music with riffs they brought in from their signature style."
1,Bolton Desecrates Sinatra,"Arrogance reigns supreme in Michael Bolton's ""tribute"" to the song stylings of Ol' Blue Eyes. The result is a painful listening experience with a bombastic singer totally out of his element. Even Sinatra's infamous ""Duets"" albums are preferable to this vanity project."
1,"This is a joke, right?","Worst idea, ever. Someone please remove his larynx. One star gives him too much credit."
3,Everybody's doing it...,"The Great American Songbook has become fodder for all the rock n' roll singers now. Nice arrangements but Bolton ain't Sinatra and Chris Walden isn't Nelson Riddle, but a pleasant listening experience. For newcomers to this music, buy the original Sinatra recordings first!"
2,Swings?,"I don't know why this is called ""Bolton Swings Sinatra""...there is no swing. It's just Bolton singing Sinatra songs and of course, not as good as Sinatra, so I would say buy Sinatra sings Sinatra. There is really no reason to hear anyone else singing Sinatra."
1,Michael Attempts the Classics,"Sinatra's phrasing and delivery were what made him such a great singer. Bolton neither has the tone, range or depth to attempt these classics, but one has to give him credit for trying. It's a shame this man can't perform more music that is original to him but has to re-sing those songs made famous by other artists. He might at least choose songs that are NOT signature tunes... and there are thousands of those in the archives of popular music. He likes to play it safe by picking big... unfortunately his flat and uninteresting grunts, groans and falsettos just can't hack the notes. This is just a hair better than his operatic album... but that's not saying much."
5,Love This CD,"Michael does a great job on these classics, I love his style and it gives another dimension to them. I have Rod Stewart's also and enjoy their different take on the same songs."
1,hideous and horrible,"Old Blue Eyes isn't spinning in his grave, his barfing in it. Bad delivery, bad voice, the only thing I like are the songs... BY THE ORIGINAL SINGER!"
1,He should retire,"It actually hurts to listen to this guy sing (Can't believe he had the nerve to issue an OPERA album some years ago!!)Aside from his ""werewolf with laryngitis"" vocals, he has no concept of how to put these songs over, can't understand why anyone would put themselves thru the painful ordeal of listening to him.He was the worst (and the most arrogant, until he was found guilty of stealing an Isley Brothers song) of the 80s and 90s, now he's back for your listening displeasure."
5,SOULFUL & SWINGING...BRAVO MICHAEL!!!,Rhythm and timing were always key elements to a Sinatra performance along with a dose of passionate yet sophisicated soul and alot of heart...this is what I feel was captured beautifully in this fine tribute to the master! Seeing Michael perform several of these songs live on TV moved me to get this collection which turned out to be as I expected and I don't understand the hostile and negative reviews...they must not like the classics so why bother? Arrangements are first rate and Mr. Bolton sounds like he is having the time of his life and the feeling is infectious for those of us who enjoy a original singer who has his own sound in a superb setting...Bravo Michael!!!
1,bolton swings sinara,"i was very disappointed in this cd due to the fact that on the norm i really like michael bolton. every song sounded like he was singing in the same key, with no emotion or pizzazz. i will not keep this cd in my collection and would not recommend it to anyone."
1,Bolton swinging Sinatra should be considered assault...,"As if the field weren't crowded enough with washed-up howlers Rod Stewart and Steven Tyler tottering into the Contemporary Classics niche, Michael Bolton has bulled his transplant-thin charisma and ripe-cheese vocals into Sinatra's china shop, and he has indeed swung Frank - by his ankles, in a wide arc of destruction that shatters, pulverizes, and devalues all the lovely nuances of the Chairman's work.Judgement: A musical excrescence made for people who just don't know any better."
2,As bad as your old hairdo!,"I have all of Michael's music and enjoy listening. But, Michael, what were you thinking?!? Sinatra is rolling in his grave. Your NY NY version sounds like a drunk singing at a wedding. Michael, you ain't no Sinatra. This was a poor choice and I am disappointed."
2,not the Michael Bolton I came to love....,"A decent attempt at these classics, but I didn't find the 'fit' to be right. Too few songs with the passion that Michael Bolton became so famous for."
1,Somebody Make Them Stop,"After the wild success for four cringe inducing volumes of standards performed by Rod Stewart, I suppose it should not come as a surprise that others would jump on the bandwagon. The problem with recording standards is that it is a rare event that the definitive version of any one of these songs has not already been done. To make a new interpretation of these songs relevant requires a knack for phrasing and an emotional connection to the lyrics that very few contemporary artists can muster (Michael Buble can...Michael Bolton cannot.) The problem is compounded when the collection invites comparison to one of the great vocalists of all time. Go buy one of the many available compilations of Sinatra himself, doing these songs as only he could."
1,bolton doesn't have it in him,"i'm sorry but there is just nothing there, no heart and soul.rod stewart has it."
1,1 star for the nice haircut on cover,"""Great"" musicians can accurately determine when to take artistic chances...the ones who are ""great"" and ""smart"" know what material to stay away from . Recording these Sinatra songs was a huge miscalculation for Bolton. He simply doesn't have the vocal chops or flair to extract the mood and feeling of these songs. While I was never a Bolton Fan, I did hear his pop records in the 80's...he sounded like he was in his league back then with his aching and annoying ballads....that sort of worked...this cd of Sinatra covers is just a ""vanity project"". It's not painfully unlistenable...it's just not very good..sorryIf you want to hear a really good (and underrated singer), check out the big band cd recorded by FrankStallone a few years ago...unlike this Bolton Bomb, it's full of great heartfelt singing .....an astonishing surprise !"
1,Bolton Snoozes Sinatra,"This cd is a disastrous rendering of timeless classics into a stratospheric realm of insipid oblivion. Michael Bolton is not a musician. Completely devoid of any voice quality or sense of phrasing, The Chairman of the Boring weaves a tangled web of musical destruction with every note. Where Michael Bolton found the nerve to actually do this is something I will never fathom. Maybe it was the money, but I'm sorry, this goes beyond financial considerations. Mr. Bolton simply had no business making any attempt at Ol' Blue Eyes' songs. What we have here is a classic example of what could occur when massive ego is combined with infinitesimal talent. To sum it all up, this cd is a meadow muffin."
1,BOLTON BUTCHED THE SONGS OF SINATRA!,"If I can choose something lower than one star I would. This is the worst piece of trash I have ever heard. He has butchered the songs of Sinatra. Classics should not be tampered with! His voice is so shrill it makes me cringe.How this man has got to where he is makes me scratch my head. He simply can not sing. His voice gets under my skin.Do yourself a favor and do not buy this CD, it contributes to noise pollution and continues a career of a man who simply can not sing. May Frank have mercy on you!"
3,This one paid off,"I enjoy Sinatra he was truly a classic performer Michael has taken chances throughout his career this was one of the ones that paid off. taking on classics is what Michael dose when he isn't writing his own. I love these songs and I know when someone screws it up that didn't happen with ""Bolton Swings Sinatra"" every song is treated with reverence and respect and He sings ""New York New York"" like it should be sung. You don't sing that classic with anything less then perfection and Michael achieves that."
1,"Sir, you're no Sinatra","Michael Bolton should never have conceived this project. Sinatra's songs were indelibly Sinatra's. A mediocre, weak-voiced singer can't match him. If you are a die-hard Bolton fan, then you might enjoy this change of pace. If you are a Sinatra fan, don't even consider this CD."
2,"Yo, Yo Dawg. It's the pits",I will concede that my life long reverence for the greatest singer of all time would cloud all my reviews of Sinatra tributes. But give me a break. The best way for Bolton to have shown his respect would have been to cease and desist!
1,He is NO Frank Sinatra...,"Why is there no 0 stars rating?I've been a Frank Sinatra fan for virtually my entire life, and I have NEVER heard his greatest songs performed like this (nothing swings on this CD). Believe me, there are much better tribute albums out there!To all Sinatra fans...stick with the songs as performed BY THE GENUINE ARTICLE. Sorry, but Mr. Bolton is no Frank Sinatra."
2,Disappointed,"I was so excited to receive this cotton candy maker for Christmas and to my disappointment it doesn't work. The instruction manual was no help. It didn't spin so the sugar just melted and burned in the center. When I tried to go on the website for information, I was redirected to some other bogus site. I am very disappointed."
1,Maybe defective?,"I got this for my kids for Christmas. We were all really excited to try it out. I read all the reviews and researched it. I have to say I was really disappointed. I was never able to produce any cotton candy. I thought that maybe the first time I used it maybe it just didn't get hot enough or that maybe something was clogged, so I cleaned it all up and retried the next morning. I let it warm up longer the second time before adding the sugar and still nothing. It spit out some granulated sugar and the only thing that I got was a small sugar ring around the bowl. I thought, ok maybe it just needs to warm up some more, but after an hour of being on and still not producing anything but a ring, I gave up. I am returning the product. Other reviews have been good, so maybe mine was just defective. I'm debating on whether or not I want to replace it. At this point I will probably wait."
2,Nostalgia Electrics CCM505 Cotton Candy Maker,"The machine itself is cute. I don't like the fact that it put out so much hard melted bits before it actually turns the sugar to floss. Also you can only add a very small amount of sugar at a time and have to turn off the machine in between, when you add the sugar. If your using it just for fun, ok but if your trying to use it for a small party forget it. It is not worth it."
3,Makes cotton candy but very slowly,"The machine makes cotton candy, but very slowly and not very much at a time. It seems like it would have to be refilled to make one cone as large as you would normally get at a carnival. If you want to make cotton candy for more than one person forget it. But, what it does make is good. Clean up is pretty easy."
1,Awful...,"This product is just awful unless you are making cotton candy for a mouse. I'm not saying I'm looking for a whole bunch of cotton candy but come on, you can't even get enough to cover the tip of the cone. It takes forever to warm up, forever to web, and spits out pieces of sugar everywhere. Highly unrecommended."
1,Big waste of money!,"I got the same machine from Walmart for $25. I was so excited to use that, cause I love cotton candy. But this just disappointed me big time. It took forever to make a samll cone(at least 5 minutes), and the sugar spilled all over the place, it just made a big mess. I used totally three times, now it is in my trash can. Junk!!!"
2,FUN BUT NOT FUN,I purchased this cotton candy maker as a gift for my sister. She really wanted one and was so excited when she opened it. We were both let down when the sugar was flying out of the heating element and hitting us and burning our skin. The tiny amount of cotton candy that comes from one batch is hardly worth getting burned over. It is also hard to clean up.
2,I am not too happy with it.,"I cringe when the kids say; dad can we make cotton candy!This is a typical design for all low end toy like cotton candy machines. They are very slow to heat up, if your going to do more than about 3-4 cones plan on cleaning again and again. The floss head is very difficult to clean the burned sugar out of and there is no way to disassemble it (without removing the rivets). Soaking and scrubbing, shaking, plunging, dunking in hot soapy water, CLR, Clorox bleach, oven cleaner, high heat I have tried it all. You will spend more time cleaning than enjoying, but it's not about us it's the kids. 3-4cones = 1+ hrs plus cleaning time (30-45 min)fun fun fun"
3,"Slow, very slow","I remind myself that this is not a professional model by any means. My kids enjoy it, it was a birthday present for the youngest. We use it outdoors, but if you put in the right amount of sugar with the scoop, I haven't noticed much sugar escaping the machine.The machine is very slow, which can be a good thing. The kids aren't going to be consuming mass quantities of sugar all at once...which brings to mind, it also teaches PATIENCE. If you plan on serving cotton candy to kids at a party I would suggest renting a commercial model for that.In summary, it is well made, it operates the way it should, the cotton candy is good (I haven't tried table sugar with it, just the mix you can buy), and it is easy to clean. Above all the kids like it and they can operate it themselves with supervision."
3,Candy Floss Maker is OK,This machine takes a long while to make even a modest ball of candy floss - to an adult (me) it seemed a bit weak - however to the children it was a hit. They spent a long while winding the strands of sugar floss on the paper tubes and had a great time doing it.(Clean up of the kitchen was left to the adults). Interest in the new device was intense for about 2 weeks and now like many things it sits in the cupboard. The price was about right for what this machine was capable of - don't expect it to be able to make candy floss for a party of 10 - the children would be adults by the time the product was finished. On balance I think I got good value for the money I spent - if you spend a lot more and get a commercial model - I don't imagine the kids interest would last too much longer.
2,what you would expect from a toy,Not good is all I can say. It worked the first time we used it and then went out and bought my floss and not it just gets to hot and melts it before it can turn into cotton candy. It takes me about 2 hours to make half a cone of candy. By the time it starts making cotton instead of spitting sugar or sticking to the sides you have run out of sugar and need to turn it off and put more in. This starts the cycle of wasting sugar over again. Really a disappointment and I would recommend just saving up of a better one.
2,fun but challenging,"It takes about 15-25 minutes to make one like the picture. This is after hours of practice. I noticed the real floss works better than one that came with it. Still, it is fun couple times but when kids are lining up to get some this thing can not keep up and after while it stops working. For 19.99 this may work better but for $39.99, waste of money."
1,Displeased,This machine slung sugar all over the kitchen and made very little cotton candy. Would not recommend this product.
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this cotton candy maker back in Oct. 2010, to use for my daughters birthday party. We got through that very slowly. We had six girls and it took forever, they could not eat together. We used it 5 more times for two kids each time, and then it stopped working altogether. Don't waste your money."
2,"It works, not great.. wouldn't suggest.","It takes an extremely long time to heat up. If you only have one child to make this for then it's not so bad but if you have two or more and would rather spend your hour or two with your kids or doing something else, then just buy the cotton candy. If you make one it needs to be eaten soon, the humidity in the air will usually start to ""melt"" it before the machine will start spitting out anything for the second one-- and that's during winter. Either way, the first one will be completely eaten and the cone licked clean before the machine will even start putting out anything for a second cone.Save your time and money.. and just buy the cotton candy. Or get a real machine. This is just a toy that your kids can't play with alone and has the ability to melt little green army soldiers as they spin and melt to death."
2,doesn't heat hot enough for the cotton candy to come out,"We got this product for Christmas and it worked okay on that first day. After that, (the next day) the machine never made enough heat for the sugar become cotton candy. I have tried using the machine in February and now in March and will return it, even if for only a partial refund. Sad to say. It was a very cute and beautifully designed piece. Too bad the quality didn't pair up to its nostalgic design. I should also mention, in case of doubt that we used it in 80 degree weather so it's not an issue about it being too cold outside. We live in the Caribbean."
4,Fun Christmas gift,I purchased this for some friends (ages 10&13) for Christmas. They seemed to really enjoy it! It arrived on time without any issues too.
5,cotton candy maker,I bought this machine for my two nephews who I only see a few times a year one is my godchild . As a kid growing up I remember my family owning a cotton candy mach just like the one I bought for my nephews . like us they use theirs for kids parties and summer get togethers with fiends ! great old retro gift for christmas !
5,Nostalgia Electrics CCM505 Cotton Candy Maker,"This is a great machine. With a little tweaking of the spinner,( on my particular machine the top was too tight), it makes cotton candy almost as fast as my full size model. Again, well made, nice machine."
4,Fun item,I purchased this item for my daughter for christmas. She loves cotton candy and this was a thrill for her to watch as the cotton candy is made. It does need to be pre heated for a few min for optimal use. It wll shake all over the table because the little suction cup feet do not work. I would not have any child even my 11 yr old could not use this machine. It is soley adult use. It will over heat after making about 4 cotton candy. The candy itself tastes good but it is not like the cotton candy you get at a circus. This one is very lite. But it is fun to watch and the kids were thrilled with it.
3,cotton candy machine....great for home w/ kids,"THIS IS A GREAT AT HOME PROJECT THAT YOU CAN INVOlVE YOUR KIDS WITH, HOWEVER, IF YOU'RE PLANNING A PARTY AND NEED TO MAKE COTTON CANDY, THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO GO! IT IS VERY TIME CONSUMING AND SOMEWHAT MESSY. OTHER THAN THAT, YOU AND YOUR KIDS WILL ENJOY THIS! HAVE FUN :)"
2,"Does make cotton candy, but...","This item is VERY messy. I did as the directions said and the sugar flew all over the place. Also doesn't make very much... one scoop basically equals one small cone. It tasted great, though. I guess it's fine if you want to use it outside and don't need to make a lot."
1,Doesn't work at all- Manufacturer admits this! Don't waste your money,"Our family tried to use the cotton candy maker 3 times. On the first attempt in December 2009, the machine made a small spool of cotton candy (think 1/8 the size of what you normally see at a circus). On the second try that same night, the machine made nothing and same with the third attempt recently (march 2010). I finally called the Manufacturer (on 3/23/2010) and they admitted that ""some units do not get hot enough to actually melt the sugar"" and that I should instead try to cut up little pieces of jolly ranchers or lemonheads! I asked them to return the defective item and they said they could only replace it with the exact same unit, AND that it would cost me $15-25 to return it! They admitted it didn't work AND wanted me to pay to have it returned. The machine doesn't work, Nostalgia admits it and doesn't stand behind their product. I do not recommend this product or this manufacturer."
2,Time Consuming,"I bought this because I'd recently rented a cotton candy machine for my daughter's party. It was way bigger than this one but I'd figure it would work fine for picnics and such. When I used it, it took a long time to warm up and to start producing the cotton candy. It takes a while to get a full cotton candy serving. Don't think I'd purchase it, had I known."
3,Let it be known,Folks this does work and yes you will get cotton candy at home from a relatively cheap price. But be warned you will get a little cotton candy for a lot of effort. Although I don't personally dislike the unit I did feel let down with the amount of cotton candy this could make. Thanks and enjoy.
2,Cotton Candy Maker,Easy assembly and cleaning of machine. This would be best if used outdoors due to flying granular and spun sugar. My 5year old child who was standing a few feet away was pelted in the eye by sugar granules. Performed slowly and for the small amount of sugar it is able to spin this is not a product I would recommend or purchase again. The kit should have included safety goggles for kids to watch an adult operate the machine.
2,Okay- but not so great!,This machine does not make a nice amount of cotton candy. It gives out some but you could not use it for a party to makes cones like the picture. I think it is best to rent a real cotton candy machine if you really want to make cotton candy.
1,Dont waste your money.,"I received one for Christmas and am not happy with it. Does it make cotton candy, yes, if you want to take fifteen minutes to make one very small cone. It cleans up easy and is simple to operate but it just doesnt work well; as soon as the sugar starts to melt it becomes unbalanced and vibrates all over the table, the sugar capacity is so low that you have to refill it several times to make one decent sized cone, and the production rate is extremely low, even for a home use item, if you were to use this at a party, the party would be over before everyone received cotton candy. The sides of the bowl are also too low and so my entire kitchen is covered with small granules of colored sugar."
1,Lots of work,"This thing does work, but its very time consuming and frustrating. If you have more than 1 child waiting on some cotton candy, save yourself the aggravation and buy the big cart version of this made by the same company. with this you will get one cone made, give it to the first child, second child waits for theirs, 1st child is back for more before you even have the second childs done. and did I mention it makes extremely small cones? I bought the big cart and gave this to the neighbor and she still calls me up asking for me to make her some in my big machine because this one is a pain! I can fill 3 garbage bags up with cotton candy in the time she gets one full size cone done (which you have to refill the machine 3 times to accomplish!) It also flings sugar all over the kitchen because there is no clear guard over the bowl like there is on the larger machine."
2,Hmmm...not so good.,"I liked the idea of a compact cotton candy maker. However this machine did not perform up to my expectiations. First issue is once you have added the sugar and start the spinner, sugar shoots everywhere. This even happens when you slowly spin the spinner by hand to settle the sugar before start up. What a mess. Secondly, it takes quite a while to even get one decent sized cotton candy serving AND the serving is not even close to what you would like to have. My daughter replied ""is that it""? After waiting for 10 minutes. Forget serving multiple children with this machine. It will only cause frustration. The only next option is a $200 machine which is way out of our budget and much too big to store. I'm sad because we have a Nostalia Electric Popcorn Machine (tall standing one) and we love it. I guess you need to buy it big to get a worth while outcome. Oh well."
2,"Good for a child, not children!!","Did not come with instructions. Takes atleast 20 mins to heat up. Took about an hour to make a small tennis-size ball of cotton candy. Most of the sugar ended up on the counter or on the edge of the bowl. For the price, it is ok for a child at home but definitely not ideal for a party or even a small gathering. Am going to return product!!"
1,Dosent Work!!,"DO NOT WASTE your time with this product. I bought this for xmax for my nieces, Bought two of them. Neither of them worked. the heater unit does not get hot enough to melt the sugar. I contacted the place I purchased them from and they said they would not return it if I opened it.. How am I supposed to know if it works or not? In any event they wanted me to take it up with the manufacture this is complete BS...."
1,Nostalgia Cotton Cancy Maker,"This is an absolute waste of money. The most it ever produces is about an adult fist-sized colorless mess. The picturs shown would take over 2 hours to produce. The mess left behind is ridiculous. We even tried flavored flossing sugar to no success. Do not even consider wasting your time and money...your child will end up being extremely disappointed and will ask why Santa would bring her something that doesn't work. Trust me, I've been asked."
1,Unusable cotton candy maker,"I am happy to see so many people like their ""Nostalgia Electrics"" cotton candy maker.Ours is awful. The reason is, it shakes itself too much. Last nite I turned it on, went to the cupboard for sugar, heard a CRASH as it had vibrated itself off the counter onto the floor.At one point it flung hot sugar across my arms.The entire kitchen floor was covered with gritty sugar.I presume ours just has a way off-balance spinner head, but I had previously decided it was due to the lack of any kind of bearing to hold it in place, or rubber mounts on the motor to let it shake (the way your waching machine doesn't jump all over the floor)..VERY disappointed.... I look for another brand with little luck (in the US)"
3,"Not the best, but ok","I bought this as I'm a huge cotton candy lover and wanted to be able to make it whenever I was craving it. I gave it 3 stars as it is fairly easy to use, but the manual was like reading a picture book. Also, it doesn't seem to make a whole lot at one time, but I may just not have it down yet. It can get a little tiresome on the wrists. But the end results are very yummy and my 2 year old son loves it."
1,Very disappointing,"My daughter just loves cotton candy. So, I thought this would be a wonderful Christmas gift for her. After 15 minutes of the machine running and collecting cotton candy on the cone, we had very little to show for all our efforts. It would take forever to spin a cone of cotton candy as they show in the picture. Not to mention that it very messy!"
1,Candy Cotton Machine,"We have only used this machine twice since purchasing it. We are so disappointed. It only spins a very, very little bit of cotton at a time. We have tried experimenting with constantly adding more sugar, but honestly, that is more trouble than it is worth. We will probably return it in the next week."
1,Don't Buy It,"This product works poorly, you are lucky if you can get it to make enough cotton candy just to cover the stick with a thin layer of cotton candy.Don't buy it, I wouldn't if I had the choice again."
1,Not worth it,I had purchased one for my kids's party. I followed the instructions. All it did was caramelize the sugar in a few spots with no significant amount of floss
1,Nostalgia CCM505 Cotton Candy Maker,"I received cutie little candy machine, but not quite I expected was messed the sugars to the all floors! I tried to make of it and got little spot!"
2,not what I expected from this product,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my little sis who loves cotton candy. I expected the machine to be able to make cotton candy with relative ease even if not in big quantities. First couple times we tried it, it didn't even produce any 'cotton' as the sugar got stuck in the centrifuge. Once I let the motor run for fifteen minutes and then some candy came out, but the process takes so long that since then it's been sitting in the corner of her closet, because it's just not the fun toy it was suppoesd to be."
2,Almost NO cotton candy :(,"So little cotton candy was produced the first time this machine ran that I wanted to cry. I'm hoping there is improvement with the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc. time..."
1,VERY Disappointed,"I ordered 2 of this product from[...] for my grandchildren for Christmas. They were so happy to receieve this we TRIED to make cotton candy the next day. It doesn't work. I called allbrands that next Monday after christmas and explained that it didn't work (you have to leave a message).I never heard from them. I again called the following week,again never a call back. I then emailed them and still haven't receieved anything back. DON'T waste your money, its JUNK,and its companies like this that makes me not want to buy anything over the interent."
5,Fun little machine.,"This little machine does a really good job. Candy tastes great! One reviewer said to follow the instructions exactly, which we did. We had no problems. It did vibrate on the counter when we put the sugar in. We just put it on 2 of our silicone pot holders to keep it from moving so we wouldn't have to hold it in place. Definitly worth what I paid for it."
3,Disappointed with product,"I ordered this cotton candymaker for my granddaughter. NO cotton candy sugar in the box with the cotton candymaker when opened. I did order a box of GREAT WESTERN Cotton Candy Sugar Floss-PINK VANILLA 52-oz box, but we could not get that to work with this machine. Having read the reviews on the machine, we did try sugar and kool aid and that did work, but just disappointed in the sugar floss; waste of money. Didn't work no matter how long you heated the machine. Very dissappointed that the product ""was suppose"" to have sugar with it and it didn't and that the sugar floss was as waste of money! Would love to know what sugar floss works! Failure to make cotton candy was sad for my graddaughter."
3,Great if you know what you're doing.,"If you understand the process of making cotton candy and are patient, you can make great cotton candy. In about 45 minutes I had so much cotton candy, it was falling off the stick. But to get there you need to have it in a room above room temp. The machine will create just enough heat, but in a cold room it will not work. On the other hand, as stated above with enough heat and patience you can make tons of cotton candy."
4,Young Children with Special Needs,"The purchasing process went very smoothly, there were no problems with delivery. I used the book in school. The book is very informative and easy to read."
5,Like drinking good Scotch on the rocks,"I thought this CD would just be a good way to get introduced to some of the not-so-famous-as-Carl-Perkins rockabilly singers of the '50s. (To correct the last reviewer, all of the tracks on the CD were recorded in the '50s per the liner notes.) And a great introduction it is, but the sound quality is excellent, despite apparently being mono recordings, and thus the CD is fun to listen to as well as being good rockabilly schooling. ""Ain't I'm a Dog,"" the companion CD, is just as good."
1,"GREAT COMPANION TO THE ""AIN'T I'M A DOG"" CD","I GOT THE ABOVE TITLE FROM ANOTHER VENDER AND THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO SEND THIS ONE AND THIS IS ABSOLUTLY THE BEST ROCKABILLY ON RECORD/CD. COLUMBIA RECORDS WAS NOT KNOWN FOR THEIR ROCK AND ROLL IN THE 50'S AND IF THIS IS NOT ROCK AND ROLL I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS. GET THIS CD AND THE COMPANION ""AIN'T I'M A DOG"". YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN A FIVE STAR RATING INSTEAD OF ONE--IT WAS ENTERED BY MISTAKE."
4,Excellent Classic Rockabilly,This is big label rockabilly at it's finest. This disc explodes from the start with a very young Larry Collins (The Collins Kids)ripping some awesome guitar riffs with an amazing level of energy. Ronnie Self's 'Bop-A-Lena' cut is up there too. Werley Fairburn's(a more obscure artist)'Everybody's Rockin' is hypnotic and you'll be humming this song all day long. The track that get me the most is 'Hoy Hoy' from The Collins Kids - it just swings. This is great rockabilly/western swing collection from Columbia Record's vault. The follow-up disc 'Ain't I'm A Dog' is a nice companion for this disc. Buy both - you won't regret it.
3,Rock-A-Billy Review,"The song selections on this cd are not as strong as the ""Ain't I'm a Dog"" disc, but still well worth the money. If nothing else Johnny Horton's Honky Tonk Hardwood Floor and the Coop cover art are worth the price of the cd. Rock-A-Billy fans will enjoy most all of the tracks.The Mean Eyed CatKNON Radio 89.3Dallas, Texas"
5,Whistle Bait Baby,I'd have to say this a great rock-a-billy album that is a must for any fan. This broadens the spectrum past the well-knowns and shows evidence of others that are just as important to the scene. 25 songs of pure rock-n-roll endurance and power. One of the best compilations of the music style.The insert has some pretty interesting facts too that may have slipped under the radar. Quality music.
3,Whistle Bait! CD,"I Like Most Of The Songs, But Some Of Them Are More Of A Country Sound. Still A Good Party Mix."
4,"Cool record, but not entirely rockabilly","This is a pretty cool compilation, and most of these acts are worth discovering, but to call this a ""rockabilly"" compilation is really a stretch, as a good bulk of these songs are more rocking country or country swing, and not rockabilly. The differences might be subtle, but there are differences. So in someone like Werly Fairburn, who I must admit, I had never heard of before this, to call his music rockabilly when he sounds more like Ernest Tubb than Gene Vincent is to totally misuse a label.Larry Collins and Carl Perkins as rockabilly artists? Most definitely. Johnny Cash and Lefty Frizzell? Not really. Just because someone recorded for Sun Studios, that doesn't necessarily make them rockabilly."
4,Whistle Bait,"This type of music takes me back to a feel good time in my life. I heard most of these songs on a static filled radio stations.... Ahh, take me back........Mick Addington"
5,New Meaning to Multi-Tasking!,Mimi O'Bara gives new meaning to multi-tasking. I recognize her family! This book hits home and is a must read for women who think the balls in the air are hitting them on their heads too often. Order two; one for you and one as a gift to give your career colleague who is also super mom and adoring wife and thinks no one understands her plight. Nothing takes the sting out of a bad day better than a good laugh. Mimi O'Bara provides more humor than the Comedy Channel. Kick off those heels and give yourself a fun break. This book made me laugh more than I can explain.
5,The Repertory of Persian Art Music,"Just a note to indicate two things: a) this is an excellent collection of a version of the Persian Radif (collection of melodies and modes on which improvisation is based), and b) it has no connection with Java or Bali at all, although this is where it appears in the Amazon listings."
3,A good rough guide,"This is a reasonably accurate guide highlighting the more well known breaks around Australia, and a few of the less famous waves. To the author's credit, he gives away no secrets, and throughout the guide he encourages a reasonably low key attitude by the travelling surfer...The more accurate descriptions are of Victorian waves, naturally, given that the author lives (lived?) there. A good paperback to have in your car, and one that will keep disappearing as people will want to borrow it for weeks and months at a time.3 stars."
5,Really Helpful,My wife swears by it. Often she will go and find just the right answer to help her deal with some household problem
3,This is a book for Scrapbookers with lots of time.,"Although I liked the pages in the book, I found myself saying, ""I would never have the time to do that."" The pages are fun and different, but appear to take a lot of work.If you do have the time, and are looking for a book with lots of pop-up, 3-D ideas, this is probably a great resource for you. It is organized very well."
5,Great Book!,"I'm a beginning scrapper who was overwhelmed by the pages I'd seen in the scrapbook magazines. A friend recommended this book to me and boy did it help. The book is broken down by technique, which is wonderful. I was able to create good looking pages just by following the easy directions."
1,Outdated Book!,"I was very disappointed in this book. It seems to very outdated, and the ideas presented are not the most creative. Sure, the beginning scrapper could easily copy the layouts in the book, but they don't have that professional look that you expect to see in a scrapbooking book. The book does have a few good tips for beginning scrappers, and it has some patterns of diecuts in the back, which were helpful, however, I wouldn't recommend buying this book for those reasons alone."
5,Excellent trading book,This book has made me a much more consistent and profitable trader. I have read it at least 7 times.I also enjoyed The Tao Of Trading.
2,An slightly expanded set of seminar slides - sloppy,"Its not often you see a set of seminar overheads which with the addition of a chapter heading for each is then sprinkled with full quotes from ""top traders"" and hey presto a book that is not a book!! I've written books and this one is not a book - seminar compendium maybe. Koppel can do better."
5,Wow.,"It's pretty rare that I've read a book that I would call 'important'. This one is. He addresses a subject matter that I have debated endlessly with friends, family and partners and does so in a balanced and fascinating manner. The book is splendid and the topic fascinating. I'm grateful to him for writing a book and shedding some sensitive and impassioned light on a very explosive subject. You will be changed by having read it."
1,Not appropriate for kindergartener,"My kindergartener brought this book home from the school library. I was surprised that this book was made available to a 5 year old. It has very dark themes - an old woman was to cook and eat bad little girls, keeping a girl against her will, no mention of a mother or father being concerned about the girl. It has shadings of Hanzel and Grettel, but much darker. The book description states, ""The illustrations of this...book are particularly effective in evoking the terror and imaginative flavor of this old Russian tale."" I don't think any child should be reading a book that will evoke terror. I was quite surprised to see the Amazon reading level at ages 4 - 8. Maybe this would be okay for a mature 8 year old."
1,Vous serez decu,"Enrico Macias is mon chanteur favori. I was terribly disappointed by this recording. Try as you might you will find nothing of the richness of the real experience of Enrico Macias. You will barely hear his voice. There's no ocmparison between this CD and the real expeience of a live Macias concert, where he sings for hours without a break and as always continues the wonderful relationship he has always had with the audience. Which other performer remains on stage while hte musicians take a break, sits down in a chair and then declairs that now ""we"" will sing together?"
5,good toy,im learning to balance my money. thi is a good toy for anyone over the age of 13. This toy help me and my girlfriend alot.
4,Good,"We purchased this for our son to learn about money. He is still too young now but we look forward to him growing ""into"" it. Looks great, but is made from plastic. Must be handed with some care as it doesn't look very sturdy."
2,Not the greatest,"The image of the original is pretty bad, with some pages being all but illegible, inexcusably so because a perfect facsimile could be had by getting permission from the Masonic Book Club to image the pages from its Vol. 1.Moreover, the translation is inaccurate, the most notable blunder being the failure to recognize ""par charity"" in the last line as a mild oath which is properly translated as ""by charity."" The use of the word 'with' instead of 'by' shows a misunderstanding of the repetitive nature of the message intended to be conveyed in the last two lines.One is led to wonder whether the translator had any knowledge of Middle English literature or just ""made do"" with the bare bones of a modern day dictionary.Good for the reader of casual interest only. The book's cover does not match the image shown on the amazon site, but the actual cover is much nicer."
1,not worth it,I was in the 14 day free trial and quit after a few days;I didn't even finish the free trial.
4,great ideas,"I love this cookbook! Not just your ordinary chicken dishes, but not unapproachable haute cuisine either. The author puts together the most wonderful combinations using fresh seasonal ingredients. She also includes tidbits of information that make reading the book a pleasure. I have had to alter a couple of the recipes slightly, but the book is highly recommended."
3,REVIEW - Fine Filipino Food,This filipino cookbook is informative but I found that the way in which it is written is off putting. The recipe directions are not written for the everyday cook and instead seems to be geared toward those cooks who have been cooking filipino food for years.There were some recipes that were easy to follow but most of them required ingredients that one must search diligently for.
5,One Of Timmons' Best,"Bobby Timmons, who will eternally be tied to Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, had a great trio. They could swing with the best of them. Like the other reviewer mentioned, I, too, find it strange that not many people have checked his work out and in particular ""Easy Does It."" Timmons is joined by Sam Jones on bass and Jimmy Cobb on drums. This trio is very tight, but flexible, that never fails but to delight the listener. Jazz fans take notice one of the greats of jazz piano. Highly recommended."
1,I'm Glad It Was In The Public Library...,"Because I would never have paid for it.Their section on Sports Betting was kind of a joke and I can sum it up for you in their own words:""If you know what you're doing, the sky's the limit.""Wow, what great advice. You could probably apply that to anything in life.Their advice on poker and blackjack are more thoroughly covered in their other books. Their craps and horse racing sections basically had the same advice as above, yet they didn't get into any specific detail (like their poker/blackjack books) as to how to make $100,000 a year.I was hoping to see systems of play, bankroll management, guidelines for betting, how to recognize/maximize your advanatage in games, etc. etc. etc.; but it never happened.I was lucky, I got to check it out of the library. Don't even bother doing that if it's in yours. Read something else."
2,riding the wave...,"If you are a big David Sklansky follower do not buy this book. If you do, be ready for a big letdown. This is mostly a compilation book of ideas written about much more thoroughly in other of Sklansky's and Malmouth's other books. Because they touch on so many topics here, they could not discuss them in as great of detail as the books devoted primarily to those subjects-mostly poker and blackjack. When Two plus Two(their publishing company) started really taking off they put out several books that were riding the wave of their most popular and respected titles. This book has a sell-out feel to me; I felt like they were just trying to cash in on the publics' perception that anything they wrote was the definitive work on the subject. Stick with the poker titles and pass on this one."
2,Not nearly as good as their other titles,"I have purchased two other Mulmuth and Sklansky books this year, Advanced Hold Em, and Tournament Strategies for Hold Em, and they were both excellent books. This book...not so much.It's just offers basic strategy advice for a number of games, most of which I don't care about, and for none of them does it offer anything close to the understanding you would get from a dedicated book (or even series of essays) about that particular vice.I was really hoping to get information on HOW TO MAKE A LIVING, as opposed to how to gamble at different games. I know how to gamble. I needed to know more about managing bank rolls, travel, limits to play, when to give up, etc..."
2,Interesting but useles for the professional gambler,This work would be considered good if Malmuth and Sklansky had not written it. I think this is by far the most disappointing work that Sklansky and Malmuth have produced.They are the standard by which gaming books are written and for them to produced this weak mathematical work is a travsitiy.
4,"Well written, but a thin plot",As you'd expect from Lowry a well written book. Her characters seem well fleshed if somewhat idealised.The story is based around rather unlikely misinterpretations of events but does engage the reader.I enjoyed this light hearted fast paced book but this is not Lowry in top form eg The Giver
5,Absorbing Overview,"I work for a global insurance broker with an international art practice that insures many of the world's great museums. I am also an avid art collector. Unlike Christian and Doomjesse, I found this book very useful for the opposite reasons. Personally, I found the ""breezy"" style of writing a pleasant change from the scholarly style of most art books I read. This is a great overview that anyone can understand. The illustrations are wonderful. We need more books on art that entertain and perhaps, for the novice, stimulate further interest in a subject. While it is a valid criticism to say that this book is not a comprehensive history, I came away wanting to know more and I can talk to my associates in the art practice in a more educated manner."
3,A Forgotten Season by Kathleen Conlon,"Description from the book back cover:Years later, the meteorological office would contradict her memory of that summer. But Veronica remembered the blue sky a dome over the horizon, the lawns in the park turning into hay, the pavements scorching her bare feet. And she remembered Charlie ... He came into her ten-year-old life, a tall young man with black hair and a dark suit. In the space of the faded seaside resort's brief summer season, he wrought a sea-change in her, in her parents, in the squalidly pretentious Spencer family. He taught her to swim, and he taught her mother that before dreams turned into nightmares, they sometimes, magically, came true ..."
3,Tiny Handbook,"This tiny handbook, only 3.5x5.2 inches, is more of a collector's item. Information on symphonies of Bach (well, the Brandenburg Concertos really) Beethoven, Berlioz, Bizet, Borodin, Brahms, Carpenter (Adventures in a Perambulator) Chopin (Piano Concertos) Debussy, Dukas, Dvorak, Enesco, Franck, Gershwin, Glinka, Grieg, Griffes, Handel, Haydn, Ippolitov-Ivanov, Liszt, Macdowell, Mendelssohn, well you get the idea. 300 pages. Actually quite a lot of information in this tiny book although about a two pages on every work. Cute book though."
1,Did Anyone Proofread The Final Manuscript?,"I bought this book and Ricki Carroll's ""Home Cheese Making"" at the same time. Do yourself a favor and skip this book. Buy Ricki Carroll's instead. The difference in price is $5, but the difference in accuracy and professionalism of the two books are lightyears apart.Not only are there typos in this book, but true mistakes that will doom your cheesemaking efforts. A couple of examples: using 3 oz of starter in the Colby recipe; adjusting the acidity of the mozzarella to 8.6pH. What other gotchas are in this book for the unsuspecting cheesemaker?Skip it."
5,Interesting and Fun,"Had a great time making cheese with the family. We made several and all came out great. Much better than store bought cheese, for sure. Highly recommended."
3,Bare bones & basic,"I realise that I'm going against the flow, but I found this book disappointing! The overall quality of presentation was not high and its B & W pictures almost look like photocopies! Sure he explains his recipes simply, but so do other books of higher quality, available here for not many more $. I'd recommend anyone considering purchasing books on this subject buy Ricki Carroll's latest book, or Barbara Ciletti's! They are much better in presentation and Ciletti's is full colour throughout!"
1,A great source of misinformation,"Recipe books that contain significant mistakes are pretty much useless for beginners. (like checking that the pH of 90 degree milk is 8.6. If you've got whole milk with that pH, you should throw it out).You can get better information from a Google search. Don't waste your money on this book."
2,Not bad. Wildly overpriced.,"In itself this book teaches how to make cheese, however for the price you don't get much meat. The quality of the print is pathetic. With 2-3 more dollars you can buy Carroll's or Ciletti's book. I mean, it's like paying the same price for an old wreck or a brand new upper level car ..."
3,Decent Starter Book,"This book was a good primer for me as a beginner. I did find many spelling errors and inconsistencies between recipes and the use of cultures, which made me wonder how careful the author and publisher were in developing this material. But, overall I did find the book helpful."
1,Rotted through in 2 years,"This fire pit rotted through on the bottom in a year and a half. We'd kept it covered, but it ruined anyhow. Not worth it."
5,A winner!,"A charming amateur sleuth mystery with a delightful heroine! Lottie Baldwin is a treat, from her quirky personality to her talent with Tarot cards. Her boyfriend, hunky deputy Harlan Erikson, might not be completely convinced of her psychic abilities, but he's head over heels in love with her, and who can blame him?In Fatal Fortune, Lottie uses her powers to help find a friend's missing husband, and her adventures will keep you turning the pages until dawn. A masterful blend of humor, suspense and romance.I'm hoping for a sequel VERY soon! Marvelous!"
4,good product for taken the smell away,good product on cat spraying it takes the smell away and leave the area clean
3,Not sure...,"I used this stuff because my kitty was urinating all over the carpets of my apartment. It definitely has a strong odor. I think it helped to clean out the urine (along with vinegar, hydrogen peroxide, and baking soda). I don't think the pheromones did any good for my kitty. She still continued to urinate in the same places, so I ended up putting kitchen cupboard liners down that matched my carpet so she wouldn't pee there anymore. I don't think I would recommend it."
1,Most Obnoxious Protagonist in Recent History,"I bought this book hoping it'd be a decent, fun foray into LA culture, of which, being a music journalist that's been bi-coastal myself, I'm familiar with. (I also happen to be from Michigan, like the protagonist.) Instead what I got, was a reminder of the prototypical Grosse Pointe girls I grew up around--materialistic, racist, driven and wooed by fame as the ultimate goals in life. I hard such a hard time with this book because the main character is totally unlike-able and represents the worst parts of our society. When bad things happened to her, I was actually GLAD. And her cop out reason of ""I'm a terrible person because someone raped me"" was way too convenient. It figures that someone like Britney Spears bought the film rights. Oh, and the writing was crappy too."
1,Save your money,"Like others I thought this book would be about the ""hip and elite"" in the LA club scene. Instead the book is about a young woman who made me cringe with each passing page. The story tries to make Tobi and her job more glam than what they are worth which just makes for a sad read. The book jumps around and leaves a lot of question marks in your path. This book was a waste of time and energy."
3,Not Bad,"This book's not bad, it's a breezy summer read. I've read better books this summer and but I've read much worse too. It's a pretty soldily entertaining book, though some parts drag on a little."
3,Some Ideas Here,"For someone getting started in scrapbooking, this provides some techniques and lots of sample pages with instructions for copying them. The techniques include chalking, hand cut tags, vellum windows, stenciling page borders, two-toned letters, yarn-fiber writing, distressing and aging cardstock, silk ribbon embellishment and other tips.Unfortunately it only tells how to do this and shows the finished page, so the process isn't always clear.As another reviewer mentioned, the 200 pages shown are not very exciting. To my taste, they appeared chopped up with just too many square elements. The author favors torn paper and hand lettering, so the samples don't vary enough to get me excited."
2,quite pricey but i guess a better alternative..,its expensive! but it does allow you to hook up powered speakers to the dock and put ur iPod in and play it out of speakers in your home..it sure beats spending 300+ bux on a bose sounddock or some other ridiculous thing...
4,Here is the skinny,It works and does excatly what it is supposed to do. It comes with two plastic cases (one for 20 and 60G) that fit over a heavy base.For me the best part of this device was the heavy base. This means when my iPod is not in it...it still stays where I put it.
5,AWESOME,"So this came remarkably fast.It is amazing, I had hooked it up to my sound system it is perfect. No problems yet, I have noticed that you will not be eligible to change the volume on the iPod itself. You will have to change it on your stereo system if you have one, if you don't you can however change the volume on the iPod.Great Product."
1,very poor performer,Very dissapointing product. It introduces an audible hum to everything it is plugged into. I tossed the packaging or I would return both I purchased. Truely money down the drain.
2,Cheaply built,"I thought this is an oem item which mean it should be the same or very close to one made by Apple. I was wrong. Very flimsy and poorly made. Interesting, you can actually see the impression of the back panel mistakenly printed on the front of the dock! Even for $10 it's too much money."
4,Good replacement for OEM dock that failed.,"After many years, my OEM dock failed. This is a fine replacement, with one cautionary note. It comes with two plastic covers for the base. They look virtually the same, but are designed for different iPod models. Once attached to the base, the plastic covers are very difficult to remove. Don't make the mistake I did and install the wrong cover. Your iPod won't fit into the base and you'll have to pry the cover off. In the end, it worked out fine, but a little documentation or labelling would have been nice."
4,Better than a universaal dock,"If your old 4th generation ipod is still going great but needs a replacement dock, pick up one of these while you still can. The line out is a real line out and sounds so much better than the universal dock. (Not sure what's going on with the line out there, but it sure isn't direct - kind of muffled and digital sounding, in a bad way.) And, oh yeah, I can still squeeze my wife's nano onto the thing, though that means having to put up with Madonna. You'll have to proceed at your own risk as far as that goes."
1,you mean it doesn't even charge if yer connecting with usb??,"the only reason i shelled out the 37 beans for this thing is that i thought i could CHARGE and SYNC at the same time, and just leave the pod sitting in the cradle when i wasn't using it and it would stay charged. well, after a few days of sitting in the cradle i took it out, and was chagrined to see that the battery was low. wtf?? would it not take a charge? is my dock faulty? well i plugged it back into the separate a/c charger and its charging juts fine. which leads me to deduce that it does NOT charge for those of us losers connecting via usb. am i correct? (someone please check me on this.) what a ripoff. apple charges all this money for fancy packaging and design, and totally rips you off. ugh. SOR_REE for connecting with usb!!!"
3,looks cool but lacks value,"iPod looks really cool on a dock. Also, the line-out via the dock delivers much better sound quality if you are hooking up your iPod to a speaker. However, this little box is overpriced. I know a friend who made a dock from scratch for less than $10."
1,Not worth it!,"The product comes the stand to hold the 20gb ipod and the 40gb ipod along with some electric thing where it gets connected. The bad part is that it doesnt come with anything else. Although it was my fault for not thinking about this, if you have a cover on your ipod it will not fit on the dock and you would have to take it off. The product description is very deceiving about the dock kit. It made me feel like it came with the right cables to connect it to my stereo. IT DOES NOT COME ANY CABLES! Unless you want to pay $37.99 or however much it is now just to make charging your ipod and playing it a little more flashier then go ahead. Just remember that the dock kit is ABSOLUTELY UNNECCESSARY TO BUY. You can do all the same stuff without it."
2,"Nice, but overpriced for what you get...","This comes in really handy, but I was surprised it didn't come with an extra set of cords for the price. I basically paid $40 just for something to sit it up at an angle. If I had known that, I could have made my own stand. Apple really should either give you two dock kits for the price of one or include an extra set of cords (which would come in handy!) with the packaging. I wouldn't buy again or recommend unless the price dropped by about half the cost."
3,"Good, not Great","This book is fun for a bathroom read, but not useful as a reference book. Most of the information can be obtained through an internet search in 2 minutes for free. It's got about 1-2 pages on each of several topics. For example, a few pages on hummingbirds, a page on acorns, a page or two on bird baths, a page or two on Zinnias, etc.Nothing earth-shattering in this book, wouldn't necessarily recommend but it has a few decent ideas and diagrams. Just don't go in expecting a lot. Would be good for a teen or retiree maybe. Not for serious birders or bird feeding type people, like myself."
5,"Grade ""A""","Sandy Roth is a one-of-a-kind when it comes to birds. Her information is presented in a natural, vey believable manner and hers is a very easy read. She offers solid tips and her instructions are common sense and right to the point. This book is a must have for anyone interested in taking care of their backyard feathered friends."
4,"Fun, easy to read, unique ideas.","This book is great for the beginner bird-watcher or an old pro. The bird illustrations are clear and amazingly accurate. In addition, the author provides bird attracting basics and includes ""recipes"" that can be prepared as a family activity to provide a learning experience for children."
1,A Big Disappointment,"I have to disagree strongly with all the glowing reviews. It's as if no one has read a novel before Emily Barton's and now they're all excited because they think they're reading something new. But it's not. Hundreds and hundreds of writers have imagined finding Eden, and Barton's version isn't even that compelling. The story of Testament of Yves Gundron is tired (has anyone ever read Swift??), the writing unelegant, and the whole thing hyped."
4,Didn't want to leave Yves,"I thoroughly enjoyed Ms. Barton's debut. It's a fresh take on an old concept, told in such a way that you don't want the story to end. If Mandragora existed, it would be flocked to by tourists trying peer into the future and the past at the same time. It's the perfect example of how no one can observe without participation."
5,Excellent,"What a fine book! Smoothly written, well structured, a challenging theme and a wonderful imagined world. One of the best books I have read in 5 or 10 years. Impressive for a first-time author just out of the gate; I hope she lives another hundred years and gives us a book of this quality every year. I usually despair about the current state of American fiction, but this book has restored my hope."
1,Not the classic,"Although filled with lots of songs, many of the classics like ""Misty"" and ""Autumn Leaves"" are absent... replaced by songs like ""Meet the Flintstones"". Also, with two songs (in very small print) per single page, or songs that cross over non-facing pages, you can't read the songs on the bandstand. This book is only good if you've tired of the essential songs and are looking for the unique."
2,ok for practice,"I got this book thinking I was gonna learn some real good jazz,but as I played out the tunes and then listened to the recording of the original song,I noticed The chord changes were not correct..what's the use of having a fakebook with the wrong chord changes? This book could be best used as a practice guide rather than a gig book."
2,not really worth it,"Well, I bought this book cause I'm learning jazz and they didn't have great tunes. Even though it's over 600 tunes, it's still not that good. I suggest getting another book. Plus, like others said, the print is really tiny and it's annoying. My friend, who plays bass, couldn't even read over my shoulder."
2,"nice chairs, but ""used like new"" isn't","I was already familiar with these chairs and liked them enough to want a set. They're simple, don't collect much dust, and have a firm yet springy feel to them.I saw a great deal with the ""amazon warehouse deals"" and figured Amazon does such a great job elsewhere, if they say it's ""used like new"", then it must be.Unfortunately, ""used some damage"" would've been more accurate. The box, while durable, has clearly been treated roughly; the 4 chairs were stacked inside. The back corner of the topmost chair, where there was a plastic cap, was heavily scuffed where it had punctured the box and been dragged around a bit upside down. Somehow, one of the chairs beneath had damage to the same spot, but more ""crushed"" - manufacturing defect that led to chairs being resold as used, perhaps?It was a good price, and the chairs are quite nice otherwise. I just object to the somewhat optimistic description of its condition."
5,The Reality of Our Drinking,"I'll keep this short and simple. Having been in Recovery for more than 13 years, watching this brought tears to my eyes. Yes, this could be any one of those with the disease of addiction's fate....ashes spread around a tree in a shopping cart pushed by a homeless drunk.....this is a must see for any friends of Bill W. that don't quite remember what is was like, and still could be!"
2,"""Third stream"" flows into a dry well....","Early efforts to introduce modern classical elements into jazz, e.g., the work of Lennie Tristano or Teddy Charles in the early 1950s, actually anticipated Ornette Coleman and the avant garde by breaking jazz free from the chains of the chord structure. By the time the ""Third Stream"" came along later in the decade, it was debatable if the music was still jazz, as it was more like programme music, composed and mapped out in advance, with little room for improvisation. This album is actually one of the more enjoyable examples of Third Stream, with some great players on board and some masterful ensemble work. If you are a fan of 20th century classical music, you might enjoy these pieces. If what thrills you in jazz, however, is hearing the individual voices of great improvisors, this is destined to leave you cold."
2,Not so hot,"First let me tell you the batteries last 10 to 15 min max , You can order on line 10 for $ 1.87 , so you better do that also. I also bought a insert so I could sight in my 7.62 Nagant rifle. The insert is so sloppy I had to wrap it with tape to get it to produce a dot insted of a large slash. You will not be able to see the dot beyond about 75 feet unless you do it at dusk when there is less light The inserts are for multi calibers so maybe they fit others better. I havent tried it in my 308 yet but as for the 7.62 x 54 nagant it kind of sucks. All and all I would say its not worth the price. It will drive you crazy trying to get a dot that you can see. I think you would be better off doing it the old way. Spend the money on ammo. I'am sure you will be ahead on cost , and have more fun shooting your gun. It realy is a wast of money."
1,Junk,"This was the second ""Sightmark"" product I tried and both items have been returned as defective. The laser lens was off center approximately 1/16"" in the opening at the front of the boresight. I never even bothered to insert the batteries so I cannot say if the unit worked or not. Both of the Sightmark products I tried seem to be plagued by quality control issues or perhaps more accurately a lack of quality control. My advice, look elsewhere."
1,junk,do not even think about buying this item I owe one for 7.62x39 and also one for .223 you can barely see the dot. I tried it in the dark room with all the lights off and I could barely see the dot on the wall all the way across the room. Unless you want to use this item as paper weight then dont spent your money on it.
1,"Good product , Shipping charge is very very high, I really want this item but I will never pay shipping charges that high.",What a great item and a good price but take a close look at the shipping charges.How can a item that weighes a few ounces cost so much to ship??????
4,The great black train,"We got this train for our 4 yr old son for Christmas. It's much larger than we thought it would be but still love it. The track holds together well but occasionally needs to be checked to ensure the pieces are fitted tightly. We love that the light indicates the train is on. The remote is great since you can run the train without having to hear the sound of the whistle, etc. The only draw back is the smell of the smoke (which can be turned off). Otherwise we love it!"
3,Useful but a bit tedious,"These ten chapters (by nine authors) all were originally published in German academic journals or anthologies between 1959 and 1975, and to a greater or lesser degree all suffer from being excessively ""Germanic"" in style. Some are more interesting than others, especially ""Important Noble Families in the Kingdom of Charlemagne,"" by Karl Ferdinand Werner, and ""From the Carolingian Imperial Nobility to the German Estate of Imperial Princes,"" by Gerd Tellenbach, both of which name a lot of names. Other chapters, such as Karl Bosl's ""`Noble Unfreedom': The Rise of the Ministeriales in Germany,"" are unlikely to make one's heart beat faster."
1,Not Impressed,NOT IMPRESSED. Not very well made. Many gaps in the materials & joints. Feet are forced in and clearly not the right ones for this model. POOR QUALITY & WORKMENSHIP.
5,"Finally, a complete book of how to manage change!",Molitor really captures the entire process of how to manage change! Too many books on success stop short of actually tying it all together. The Power of Agreement explains how it all fits togehter and provides a step by step process for success. Great book for all leaders!
4,An Engaging Read,"""Slightly Married"" is another great offering from Mary Balogh. While the plot itself is not the most original plot ever, romance readers don't really read for plot, we read for character development. And Balogh delivers some great characters.Eve and Aidan are two people from radically different backgrounds. Aidan is the younger brother of a Duke and Eve is the only daughter of a Coal Miner made good, fit together like the final to pieces to a puzzle.The multi-book - family saga deal is really popular at the moment with mixed results. I have found that often the books are repetitive because the characters seem to be carbon copies of each other. Balogh doesn't have that problem. I can't wait to see what happens next."
2,I Hope The Rest Of The Series Is Better Than This!,"This is the second book of Ms. Balogh's that I've read in this series and I have to admit that I'm beginning to loose faith here. I found the characters to be difficult to like (Aidan is so...wooden, and Eve is just...well...seems to have no self esteem).I think that this book could have been a lot better if for not the snobby feelings I got from so many of the characters. I know that we are talking upper class, but still. It left me wanting and I found the romance to be lacking in a big way. I have since borrowed the next in this series from a friend. This is one read that I will not be re-visiting again."
1,"Lifeless, passionless, and plotless","This book is a total waste of paper. The poor trees that died for this completely lame novel is a crying shame. There is NO sexual tension. There is NO change in either character's identity. In fact, their great love development makes no sense whatsoever. My advice is-don't bother."
3,Slightly recycled,"As with all of Mary Balogh's romances, this one presents accurate history and plausible situations. However, I was distracted throughout the book by the resemblances to Jo Beverley's Malloren family romance; there were more than a few similarities between Rothgar and Wulf, and the unusual set of first names also harkens back to that series as well. I see reflections of Georgette Heyer, too. Having said that, I compliment Balogh on the time she takes to draw her main characters as more than just one primary characteristic (e.g., ""loyal"" or ""autocratic"") and as having complex motivations for their actions."
2,Not worth the time!,The charecters had to spark. I am hoping that the rest of the series is better! But it was really a boring plot and found myself scanning the book just to get through with it.
4,I liked it but...,"This book has a good plot and story but I felt the intimate scenes were a bit...cold. I was offended, and certainly not able to let my sixteen year old daughter have this one when I was finished with it. Otherwise a good book."
5,Very unique concept!,"I really, really like where the author went with this one. Twists and turns and was riveting without having to have a load of sequels. Don't let the drab cover and/or title fool you, you should read this one."
4,Intriguing story with a nice twist.,"Quite an intriguing action story with a twist ending I frankly didn't see coming. Not a profound book, just straight entertainment of the cross-country, post apocalypse sort."
3,Review of Forced Conversion,"An okay story, but very formulaic, I knew the ""twist ending"" was coming at the very beginning, there is very little depth of character development, but for $0.99 its worth the purchase for the Kindle."
3,Decent,"I disagree with the other reviews, I like this book. To keep it brief. This isn't the greatest written book I have ever read, but it is a good collection of info. I recommend it for a John/Paul fan who doesn't already know EVERYTHING, and would to start somewhere. Although the author does look at McCartney lesser than Lennon, I feel it doesn't get in the way of the reason I read the book, the info and quotes."
2,Lacks depth,"I had high hopes for this book, considering the fertile and overlooked topic of the Lennon/McCartney partnership, but it turned out to be a missed opportunity. Unfortunately, everything about the author's analysis is disappointingly obvious and sometimes just plain mistaken. John and Paul did not bond over the deaths of their mothers; neither were touchy-feely teens and it took both of them years to come to terms with their respective losses. They bonded over rock and roll and later, over their mutual ambition. Their drive to succeed should have been explored here, but wasn't. Linda, Yoko and their substantial influence were mentioned almost passingly. This book is route and superficial. Unless you're new to the Beatles, you already know more than you'll get from this book. Like the author's stance that Lennon was the real talent, the real revolutionary - well, how obvious is that?"
1,Worst Beatles biography ever,"Pure crap. This ""writer"" is that type of person that spits into the plate that feeds him. This man is worse than a vampire or a hyena. I don't know how he got published."
2,Cute but poor quality,Very cute shoe as far as color and style... I get so many compliments on this shoe but...My son is 5 months old and he loves to rub his feet together. Well I am assuming this is why the sole starting to come apart I dont want to believe that it tore all by itself..but very cute colors and unique style
2,The Smell is Awful!,"I had high expectations for this anti-aging cream; I tried it for several nights. The texture is good. However, I couldn't give a rating for the efficacy of the product due to the fact that I couldn't use it long enough to do so. Why? Because the product smells so bad it was nauseating to me. So, I have built an aversion to it.I am all for natural products and that is why I purchased this product. I have used the doctor's progesterone cream in the past as well. It would seem to me that some natural aroma therapy could be put into the product to avoid this onerous smell. I am aware, however, that perhaps the smell is something that others could tolerate. BUT, I would even hold my breath while applying; yes, the skin absorbs the cream right away; but I built up an aversion to using it - the smell is that bad."
1,ordered twice got 2 different products,I ordered this a month ago and got a great product that did not dry out my skin as many skin creams have too much alcohol. This one was great.Just got my second jar and dbl checked it against the previous product. The same name and packaging.This product is not at all the same. Totally different very acidic and dries my face right out.Am going to return it and try something different.Very disappointing.
3,Book review of Terror In Beslan,Eye opening account of terrorism in Russia and how it could affect the USA. We need to overhaul our immigration policies or we're gonna have the same thing happen here on American soil. Wake Up America..This Could Happen To You.
1,Don't support this phony,Google the authors name and you will see just how qualified this guy is to give advice...... Hope no one else buys into his BS
1,Research the author,"It is difficult to know what is fact when reviewing the work of someone who, at best, has misrepresented himself to many people in the intel, military, and law enforcement community. For that reason, I caution anyone considering to purchase this book."
5,Lessons revealed,"This book gives an excellent review of the problems with protecting schools and the children. The ideas presented by the author for school protection should be read by every school administrator, teacher, and our government."
1,Author is a fraud,Author is a fraud with no counter-terrorism experience. He claims all sorts of experience and credentials which are false. Buyer beware!
1,"Can't keep his own ""facts"" straight","I wish there was a selection for no stars. There are numerous inconsistencies in this book starting with the claim that he arrived ""within 3 hours"" of the end of the siege- he's since admitted he didn't arrive into Russia itself until the day after. And the book only gets worse. For a PhD holder this book is filled with shoddy research and nothing resembling academic level work. I saw better undergrad papers than this ""book."""
1,Credentials of the author are suspect,"While I enjoyed this book initially, and recommended it to many friends in both the MIL/LEO and eduction fields, I can no longer recommend it as a legitimate resource. The author has been accused by numerous people in the MIL/LEO community of fabricating SOF/Counter-terror credentials. Instead of responding to these challenges, he instead resorted to naming those who questioned his credentials as defendants in jackpot-lawsuits, workplace harassment, and criminal investigations. This represents nothing short of obfuscation, legal bullying, and an absolute refusal to address the legitimate question of his shaky credentials. Until this is resolved in a way that demonstrated that the author actually has any credible background in the topic, rather than merely a law degree, I cannot recommend this book as a resource on this subject. Steer clear."
4,Book Review,The purchase process worked very well and the book arrived in excellent condition. The only glitch was the fact that the book did not arrive for an extended period and when investigated I found that the seller had registered it with the postal service but never delivered it to them. Attempts to contact the seller were difficult at best and he never personally responded to my queries but then the book arrived.
1,"Author is a researcher only, do not be misled.","I am a law enforcement officer in Texas, a narcotic investigator, SWAT trained, and a LE sniper. I attended some tactical training and this book was recommended by the instructor. I was given the impression that Mr. Giduck was prior service military and had extensive training and experience dealing with tactical situations. I ordered and read the book, and while I learned about the awful attack at the Beslan School I am dismayed to find that the author is not likely qualified to advise the American LE community in dealing with situations like this.If you are looking for strictly the input of an academic researcher in planning and training for this type of scenario, I recommend the book. However, if you are looking for the perspective of a skilled, trained, and been there done that operator- you should look elsewhere."
1,I only gave it one star because they wouldn't let me give negative stars.,"The author is an total fraud. His claims of being an authority and his expertise are complete BULL. If you want the full story on this waste of air and his mountain of lies upon which he built his resume, please follow this link. [...]"
1,Incorrect facts and false credentials,"This book has already been shown to have erroneous facts about events that occurred at this incident. The fact that the author has fictionalized his personal history with random Special Forces credentials and very thin experience in law enforcement or anti-terrorism, I would definitely not purchase this book or any of the other books that he has written as their integrity has been compromised greatly."
1,Amazing,"Amazing that there are so many positive reviews considering the simple fact(s) that the author has inflated, to say the least, his experience(s). Suffice it to say the author is not an expert on the subject matter that he wrote about, nor is he a subject matter expert on the field that he lectures in currently. Allegedly he claims to be many things, including an olympic weightlifting champion, Special Forces qualified, Ranger qualified, etc.. None of which are true, therefore I would recommend caution when reading, specifically assuming that the author is who he claims, which he is not."
5,5-Minute Laugh! UAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!,"Okay, I have to say as a die-hard Slayers fan I was a little disturbed when I saw this... but there are so many great inside jokes I couldn't stop laughing! The three-episode flashback series has a slightly different feel to it than Slayers, NEXT, and TRY but it comes through. Though I don't like the alternative to Lisa Ortiz for Lina's voice, it's okay.Scary Chimera Plan is hilarious and we get to see 11 Naghas laugh for 10 mins straight, so plug your ears! There are so many slap-stick jokes I could've died.Jeffrey's Knighthood was the scariest thing I've ever seen. Nothing like an overprotective mother who will smash you with a mallot from hammarspace if you so much as say a word against her ""talented, handsome"" boy.Mirror, Mirror was hilarious. If you've ever wanted to know what a ""sniveling humanitarian"" Lina or a demure, blushing Nagha, here's your chance. I garuntee you won't be sorry!Any Slayers fans, e-mail me, gangnes@attglobal.net"
2,Songs of Ireland,Was disappointed. Singer over-powered the accompanying music rather than blending with it. Singing voice was not that good. Have heard much better Irish singers. Would not purchase Brobdignagain Bards again.
5,Blessed are the Irish,"This cd makes me wish I was Irish...I raise a glass in toast to this cd.From traditional Irish songs like""Danny Boy"",""An Irish Lullaby""&""Rocky Road to Dublin""to traditional Irish drinking songs,such as ""Finnigan""s Wake""&""Jug of Punch"".From the comical to the more heart felt,this cd has it all.You may not be Irish,but you'll be singing along with the songs like you were.One of the best Irish cd's I've ever heard."
4,Lively,I can't if these songs are traditional or not but they are realistic in a metaphorical sense. I would say that each song has something to teach whether one drinks or not. The lead's voice may be a bit overpowering but I'm sure it is supposed to. Songs of old told a story and the voice and understanding it is the most important aspect of the song.
2,Songs of Ireland (Irish Folk Songs) Brobdingnagian Bards,"I wanted some authentic Irish folk songs for my elementary music classes. Only two or three titles from this CD will be useful. I was disappointed. However, I did like some of the accompaniments."
1,Oh Dear,"A dreadful selection of material designed to appeal to third/fourth generation Irish in USA, preferably wearing leprechaun hats and swilling warm Guinness. Hopefully won't be heard in Ireland."
3,Repetative,"Since it's a 2 CD set, they should have included no more than 2 different mixes of each song instead of the 3 or more on here. They could've gotten a wider variety of songs and made it less repetative that way."
3,It's a good buy for a Wu Fanatic or collector of the like...,"...I had to get this because I'm wu to the fullest. I do have to admitt thought that I was a bit disappointed, because the back of the video says ""approx running time= 1 hour"", not even close. The whole ""domestic violence"" short film was no more than 16 minutes long, but at the end of it there are like 4 or 5 music videos which really make up for such a short timed film. It does say in the cover ""a short film by the rza"" but I wasn't expecting it to be this short. Anyway it is worth the buy because all of the actors in the movie are wu killa bees and the videos are rare and dope. It be better if this was on DVd, I hate tapes but oh well, you'll live through it. Cop this piece if you are a true wu fan."
1,stereotyped/gangbanger,"This video promotes racial stereotypes. It is full of foul language. Every other word is ""m-f'in"" and ""m-f'er."" Shows an extreme skew of very violent, racist, sexist picture. Does not include what normal domestic violence really is. Easy to dismiss it as this depicts the extreme. However, do need to give them credit for having the courage to deal with this topic and make a stand against it. It might be good in dealing with inner-city gang-banger or wanna-bes."
3,Rza's domestic violence,The tape is alright. THe movie is really short. I thought it would be longer than that. The videos are kool at the end. Its a good tape for a wu collector like myself. Adios
3,too average,This review is written for IMARAN but it also appears on other CD's - a serious mistake! I asked Amazon to correct it but they have not done it. I have most of the Touareg series on Al-Sur and I love all of it. The problem with this CD is that the music here resembles Vol. 5 (Choyly) but is not as expressive. The long instrumental piece is remarkable and I listen to it a lot - cool oud playing to desert rhythms.I recommend it only to people who have the rest of the series.
4,The Music is Good but.....,"Please note this is a Specific Iraqi Maqam a ""Historical Arrangement""I bought this album because of my interest in studying Maqam Music.Pros: Good Music and Performance.Cons: Problem with this album is the Sing Titles are wrong...that means the Maqam you listen to it is not the one in the title.The correct titles are...1- Maqm Hijz Humyn et pasta2- Maqm Bayyt - Atba et pasta3- Chobi - Goom Darajni4- Maqm Awj et pasta5- Maqm Rst Penjgh et pasta6- Maqm Awshr et pasta7- Maqm Sab et pasta"
3,Not as helpful as I had anticipated...,"My expectations were a little high for this book. It was written very well, I was just disappointed in it. It just reinforced my feelings as to how unfair parental alienation can be and how so little is being done in the courts to discourage this. I guess I was hoping for a ""miracle answer"" to this problem."
3,Good intro book,"This book gives a good introduction on hair coloring, a lot of theory and a large number of interesting tips, however it falls short on the most important topic: Formulating. The book explains all the elements to consider when formulating, but doesn't explain in depth how to combine them all and how to build the actual formula for every case you might encounter.Less important, this book is printed in black and looks as if it was designed for color printing and comes back an annoying number of times on ""how to make big money coloring hair"".Despite the shortcomings, there are interesting thing to learn from this book and it might be useful as complement to the other Milady haircoloring book."
2,A missed opportunity,"A worthwhile effort to bring together great names like Benny Carter and Ben Webster together with musician's musicians like Jimmy Rowles and Shorty Sherock doesn't really pay off in this (short) album. Two of the 4 tracks are rather bland blues riffs which are merely meant to serve as a launching pad for the soloists. They never really seem to take off, though. In a band consisting of 8 members, there is naturally little time for each individual member to make his mark, and the album bears the results. It's a pity this band wasn't provided with tunes worthy of their considerable talent. The album never catches fire and although it only last for 35 minutes, it gets rather tedious after a while and may get you reaching for the STOP-button during the first track. Carter and Webster have many albums in their catalog which are infinitely better, but it's a pity for Barney Bigard in particular that this recording must be deemed a missed opportunity."
4,Fine Form!,"One of Benny Carter's last jazz recordings before he became totally immersed in writing for the studios, this set matches his alto and trumpet with tenor great Ben Webster, clarinetist Barney Bigard and trumpeter Shorty Sherock on a pair of lengthy blues and Carter's ""Lula"" and ""When Lights Are Low."" All of the swing all-stars are in fine form, making one wish that they were not being so neglected by critics and fans alike during this era; Webster soon left the U.S. permanently for Europe."
2,Only for the Avid Collector - Like Myself,"This book is such a disappointment. The artwork is good enough, but the plot is so silly and condensending that one is either offend or just doesn't care. I personnaly like religious themes in comics because they can be used to inspire true ideas about nobility and morality; however, this book tries to please every religion and in the end, aleinates all but the New Age movement.I have collected comics from Christian themes (though rarely theological correct) and cultic themes and have enjoyed most all of them even though I am a consrevative Chrsitian. However, they had either fun or very well plotted stories. This book has neither.It is a boring story that insults our intellect as it tries to be all things to all people. Buy for the art only."
2,Batman/Deadman deserves death not glory!,"I first read Batman/Deadman: Death and Glory when I was still in high school, and I was impressed by the lavish artwork, but not by the story, it bearly mearsures up to any of the greater batman stories and alomst diminshes the story into a laughable farce, if you're looking for a good Batman story, please, look elsewhere! Peace"
4,"yes, but!","I have to agree with the general text of the earlier review, with one exception. Any lover of latin/Brazilian rhythms will love Saudade. This one alone makes the album worth the price of admission. Adderley was getting into his 'funk' stage, as was almost everyone trying to feed the family and play jazz, but he still held to his jazz roots. A far cry from the ""milked down"" pop tunes discs that so many of his peers were doing at this time. Sadly you need to get the whole enchilada here to get this one cut, but trust a true Brazilian jazz freak..Saudade swings and delivers!"
2,Not the funky Cannonball record you are looking for.,"It is naturally tempting to seek work from Cannonball featuring electric instruments - his howl seems like a natural for some of the Sly or J.B. sounds on some of the period's jazz - wrong - sorry but the piano player is a drag and sets the pace for a slow motion buzz kill of a record. We should be grateful for Cannonball's natural pull towards the funky soul he channeled on perfect records likeMercy Mercy MercyorWhy Am I Treated So Badand forget the idea that the man sat around listening to ""There's a Riot Going On"". Of course their are a few moments here and there. Records likeSoul Zodiachave their small charms but for the most part Cannonball simply swung funkier and more intensely left to his own blues, bop based sound - we all need a stack his records but maybe not this one. See you in the Donald Byrd section for the record you might of thought this one was."
1,Mystery Science Theatre 3000 Fodder,"This film was utter tripe! Wan't sure what was happening in terms of the plot, but I wasn't watching because of the story. I was hoping for some decent martial art sequences, and was denied even that. Overly stylized, weak story, poor fight sequences; it's a movie to be avoided."
2,Steer clear,"I was highly disappointed with this movie. It was almost painful to watch, but seeing to it that I bought it ($9.99) and thinking it would be good after reading the back cover, I had to finish it. The only good thing about the movie was the location/scenery the shots were filmed. Other than that, the fights were so few and far in between that it made it so painful to just sit there and ""wait for something to happen"". With all the supposedly talented cast to their own style of martial arts involved, the film never showed their true talent. Also, what was with the fake blood splatter? Was this supposed to make the fight scenes interesting? It made it quite annoying!Save your money, even if it is just to rent it. Don't say I didn't warn you."
3,"Musically excellent, sonically deficient","Smith is a wonderful musician and his interpretations are impeccable. But with the exception of the 2nd lute suite BWV997 which opens the 2nd disk, there is just no bass in the recording and even the lower midrange is effaced. So the fat plucked bass sonority that says ""baroque lute"" is missing and the bass lines and lower midrange voicings are lost. A shame."
2,So. So.,"This guide is okay but I felt it was a little tricky to figure out at times. So i played the game w/o it and I realized you can do fine w/o it. So if you're a fan of this game, you probably don't need the strategy guide, but it contains some minor hints but I think someone could do fine w/o it."
5,So what. You do a different version of Seiunchin Kata...,"So what. You do a different version of Seiunchin Kata. It doesn't matter. What's presented here in this short work will unlock your mind to the possibilities within the kata that are so much more than the standard Bunkai (applications) that you already know. Mr. Martinez definitely has some editing problems. They are English to be sure, but they are not enough to ruin the important information in this book. By utilizing the Okinawan Art of Tuite Mr. Martinez demonstrates just what can go on in the applications of the kata enhancing our knowledge and growth even more. Bravo! Buy the book."
1,"An interview, a disappointment","This tape was a disappointment to me. It sounded more like an info-mercial than a serious communication of ideas. It seemed like it was produced to promote one of the author's books, not a tape that should be sold."
4,"Not the best Greek myths book, but an interesting one","McLaren's other book ""Inside the Walls of Troy"" is better than this one, but I really enjoyed this short book.Atalanta has been raised since birth to be her a son to her father, rather than a daughter. So when her father proposes a marriage, she is furious. She outruns all her suitors in a marriage-or-death race, but one.Andromeda is betrothed to someone whom she wants nothing to do with. Her mother makes the mistake of proclaiming that both she and Andromeda are more beautiful than the goddesses. Andromeda is sent to death, but something happens that changes that.Psyche is one of the most beautiful women alive. One day, a nameless immortal asks for her hand in marriage. Psyche goes to the man's home and is never happier, until she makes a horrible mistake.I LOVED Psyche's story and I wish that McLaren had made Psyche's story a book alone. While this is not my favorite Greek myths book, it is worth reading.~Atalanta"
2,not helpful,"I guess I ordered this book thinking it would help with a pretty normal ADD kid; instead it focuses on kids who are severely disabled, is very dry reading, and not helpful unless you have a child with a true disability."
4,Very pleased with flavors and price,"Don't know what previous reviewer is complaining about. I've found flavors to be very flavorable and distinct. I like this mix because there's no licorice in it. The dark colored one you see is grape flavored. Just received my second order. Only complaint on my latest order was it was slightly stale, candy slightly hard, though expiration is about three months into the future. Compared to other brands I think this is a good buy, especially with free shipping. I will continue to buy this as long as price stays reasonable."
1,Fruit Slice Wannabe,These were awful! No fruit flavor except just a hint and I barely knew what it was. These are just corn syrupy chewy bland fakes! That's what I get for trying to save a few dollars... it all went into the trash and I had to order what I wanted in the first place. If you like fruit slices get the Sunkist brand or Haribo Fruit salad or Haribo Peaches. Those are full of great flavor and are worth splurging your money and calories on.
3,the best great expectations i have ever seen,"but i have not seen any others. in fact, i really didnt see this one but i feel left out not writing a review"
4,Very Listenable......,"in fact this cd serves as a good definition for mainstream. The opener, ""High Life"", the first of three originals, is a pretty good bop tune. The first of three standards, ""When a Woman Loves A Man"", follows next. This medium tempo ballad is my favorite because Buck displays a very lyrical aspect on both muted and open horn. The other two standards, ""Thou Swell"" and ""Can't We Be Friends"" follow. Both are very listenable with ""Can't etc"" making more of an impression with Buck opening and closing the tune muted with a nice middle solo by Tate. The last two originals, ""Birdland Betty"" and ""Kansas City Nights"", remind me, unsurprisingly, of some of the Basie small group sessions. This impression is further enhanced by Sir Charles Thompson's style, light fingered and sparing in notes.......again, reminiscent of Basie.Anyone liking mainstream, small groups, or fans of any of these artists should enjoy this cd."
5,good for the heart,"stunningly beautiful photos of amazing shirts.graphic detail makes this book a must for anyone interested in the indians of the plains.these shirts are truly works of art and by just looking at them you can feel all the mystical and magical power that they evoked then and still do today.useful text accompanies the photos,highly recommended!!!!simon mote."
1,"Tradition, But Not Much Beauty","The cover is undeniably beautiful, but misleading. Of all the shirts in all the collections in the country, the editors managed to find the most unattractive, obscure examples possible. The editors focused on quilled and painted styles. The text is not helfpul, and sounds as if the writer struggled to find something interesting to say about each shirt. One Sioux shirt is included among several blase Crow shirts and even more Blackfeet examples. This book was an expensive disappointment, and I gave it to a library, where I wish I had found it."
5,One of the Best,"This is an absolutely wonderful book and one of the BEST I have read on Native American Art. The color plates are exquisite and plentiful. The research is in depth and besides being well written, is reader-friendly. If you are thinking of purchasing this book, you have made a good choice - you will enjoy every time you pick it up."
5,weak convergence taught rigorously,"When I was a graduate student at Stanford in the late 1970s I took a course in stochastic processes from Sid Resnick. Patrick Billingsley is an excellent probabilist who has written some very clear texts on probability theory and measure theory. In studying asymptotic distribution theory for independent or dependent data convergence in probability is a very important problem and Billingsley was the master at explaining it as well as the other major probability convergence criteria. So we relied heavily on Billingsley's two books on the convergence of probability measures. This text was in its first edition and was referred to as Big Bill because it was the more detailed of the two books. The other which came in paperback was simpler and more concise. That one we called Little Bill. Although we tended to find what we needed in Little Bill, Big Bill was useful also."
4,...,"I ordered this for my 7 year old last year. I do not speak or understand spanish, but my kids are half latino. I thought I would be able to read this to them, but no. This book is half english/half spanish. I wish I known that before purchasing, but I guess that was my error. That's why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. But if you can read spanish and english then this is a good book."
2,not zombie material,i.ve watch lot zombie movie in my opinion if it gross stuff your into there couple scene guy get face rip off here there .for as been funny it like hit and miss.i definely would rent a copy not buy it.
1,AWFUL MOVIE!!!,"This is by far, the worst movie I have ever seen. I gave it one star because that's the lowest rating, but if I could give it minus 5, I would... believe me. Don't waste your time watching it."
1,Not funny,"I enjoy zombie films, but the humorous films are hit and miss. This film, which features a gay man going back to his hometown so that he can come out to his mother, on the surface seems interesting plot for a film in this genre. However, everything in the small town is so stereotypical and over the top it is quite simply silly rather than the campy hit they expected it to be.The acting was ok, nothing spectacular and the zombies were lame. An example of not so funny humor, is a woman rescues a lost little girl and starts to take her home with her, but as they are crossing the street, the girl is hit by a car. The woman is left holding only the arm. Eh. I fast forwarded to find out how it ended.I'd recommend Shaun of the Dead or Zombieland if you want your humorous zombie film fix. This neither was funny nor entertaining."
1,Zombies of Mass Destruction,"I watched this video on zunevideo, on xboxlive, because it was referred to being like Shaun of the Dead...Please, save your money and your time.. or Microsoft points...(in my case)The acting is horrible... the effects are crap as well... Its not funny...I'll be honest. I regretted wasting my time with this video.The stories basically non existent..its not at all creative.The zombies are cheap looking...This is the second one start rating I have ever given out for a product. But this video definitely earned it.The only way that you could enjoy this movie... is if you were on drugs, and looking through rose colored glasses.Now I loved Shaun of the dead... but Shaun of the dead, had better everything. Humor... acting, effects.."
1,POLITCAL AGENDA WITH ZOMBIES IN THE BACKGROUND,"THIS FILM CAUGHT MY ATTENTION DUE TO CLAIM ON THE COVER STATING ITS THE BEST OF ITS TYPE SINCE SHAUN OF THE DEAD. WHAT A MISLEADING LIE THAT WAS. THIS MOVIE IS A MAJOR SLAP IN THE FACE TO SHAUN AND ANY CLASSIC ZOMBIE FILM. IM NOT GOING TO GIVE A PLOT SYNOPSIS AS OTHER REVIEWS HAVE BUT I WILL SAY THE OBVIOUS MOCKERY OF RELIGION, GAY RIGHTS, ANTI-TERRORISM AND OTHER POLITICAL THEMES MAY HAVE THEIR PLACE IN SOCIETY BUT NOT IN A ZOMBIE FILM THAT CLAIMS ITS GREAT WHEN ITS A LONG SHOT FROM IT. IF YOU HAVE A TRUE DESIRE FOR A GOOD ZOMBIE FLICK DON'T WATCH THIS TRASH STICK WITH A CLASSIC LIKE SHAUN OF THE DEAD."
1,Zombies of lame Destruction,"You know, if a zombie epidemic did occur, you don't only have to worry about the undead but dogs, as they'd be wiped out instantly.The worst part is where the Priest tries to pray with a Zombie to help get rid of the sin that is turning him into the living dead and the zombie rips off his arm and beats him with it.I was a little on the fence about this film, on one hand it could have gone in the direction of a cool zombie ""undead"" film with some comedy elements. On the other hand it could have gone in the direction of the lame zombie comedy, where you have cheap gags like farting and dogs being thrown in your face as ""shock"" jokes.One of the worst zombie movies I have seen in a long while, undead hands down.They did make this video and it was shown at the Port Townsend Film Festival in Washington, just don't buy it."
4,If you like dogs.,I thought this was an interesting topic. This episode reflects on the historic connection humans have with dogs and how the symbiotic relationship has impacted both species. Quite good to have on while I'm doing easy hobbies that I can look away from to watch the video.
2,Download Not Mac Compatible,It's absolutely wonderful that PBS is selling it's show through Amazon. What's not wonderful is that Amazon's download software is not Mac compatible. (I imagine this is a play against Apple's iTunes). But there are many Mac users that want to download video from Amazon. This is not 1996. Amazon: Step it up and make downloaded video available for Macs!
5,Stonehenge: Answers to the Mysteries,"Really enjoyed all the information and informed speculation in the Nova episode Secrets of Stonehenge. I came away feeling that I had a better understanding of the late Stone Age people who conceived and built Stonehenge. It seems they were just as inventive and capable as their descendants and far more technical than you would imagine. Did Stone Age Britons use stone ball-bearings to move giant stones?Their religious beliefs remain mysterious, but ties to the technical material of their age, stone, seem to be religious as well as manual. If this mysterious monument and the technical skills used to build it peak your curiosity, you will enjoy the documentary."
5,What a hat!,"Best Hat ever....correct sizing gorgeous heavy high quality (I am pretty sure these are made in the USA which gives me all the ""street cred"" I need....) I actually bought this for my teen son who loves it and stores it on a substantial silver candlestick holder Wonderfully made....can't say enough about it!"
4,Nice book,Not written for North Americans but I found this book very useful all the same. This book made a good introduction to falconry and it was a pleasure to read.
2,Not impressed,"I was hoping to find a book with unique ideas for a nursery. These are the same pink and blue rooms, but with just more hype and grandeur, that are for sale at Pottery Barn Kids. Nothing unusual, just on a designer's budget. I also felt that the majority of the book was a commercial for Bellissimo's product line of crib bedding as well as photos of her family.Rather dissappointing..."
3,Murals done by Pennys from Heaven,As an artist myself I was interested in finding out about the murals. After NOT receiving any info back from the Wendy Bellissimo phone/email I did some research myself. A woman named Penny did the murals!!! NOT ENOUGH CREDIT WAS GIVEN TO THE MURALIST. (Other than maybe a mention in the beginning.) In any case I passed the info to my girlfriends before they bought the book. The Wendy Bellissimo line on it's own is nice...but the murals are what put it all together! Bravo to Penny! Great ideas from Wendy on placement of furniture and bedding materials. Certainly a book that you can get inspired from but disappointed that the muralist didn't get the credit she deserved....that was where I found most of my inspiration from.
1,not worth it,"this is just a glorified home photo album. wendy bellissimo creates the most beautiful nurseries...too bad they are not in this book.the enclosed cd shows you things like...how to mix rice cereal, and how extravagant her daughters birthday party was.a complete disappointment!!!!!!!"
1,Lower your exectations,"I found little in the way of substantive information in this overpriced publication. I was truly disappointed. Perhaps my expectations were too high. For the next reader / purchaser I suggest you lower your expectations to a minimal level, then perhaps you will not be surprised."
4,"Not totally comprehensive, but still excellent","If you have an interest in Japanese cooking, this book is a must. The dictionary does not contain every ingredient, utensil and dish that may be found in Japanese cuisine, but it makes a valiant attempt to do so. Entries are listed with a romanized pronunciation as well as the Japanese characters, sometimes with several variations of how to write the same term. In addition the excellent appendices explain in detail how such staples of the Japanese kitchen, such as shoyu and katsuobushi, are made and used. An invaluable reference for anyone who does not read Japanese at native-level fluency."
1,this song has no meaning,I think wake up is such a stupid pop song... It is poser rock. It is not rock at all. This song has no meaning and it doesnt even make any sense. What was the point of this song? Was it to wake people up???
4,DeWalt Quality (DW292 Electric Impact),"When you buy DeWalt you know what you are getting. Rugged, dependable, good value for the money. Good power. Wish I had purchased one years ago."
4,It can get a lug nut,It takes a minute but it will get a lug nut off. It's perfect for small jobs I would say.
2,Useless for lug bolts,This wrench cannot even remove the lug bolts from hand tightened aluminum wheels.Very disappointed...
4,pretty good for a corded,"Its n ice to have the cord since you dont need a battery(and the fact it cant ever run out of juice) obviously this doesnt touch a good quality air tool but i use mine alot..... to alot of these reviews out there i ask this question"" are you using impact sockets"" any type of extension,deep socket, chrome socket , universal joint is going to take alot of the power away from any tool like this. they act like a torqu stick....so you really need the right sockets for it"
5,Like walking on a cloud,"extremely comfortable, well made, nice looking (could even wear outdoors) and very well priced"
2,Too stiff and hard to be comfortable,"Sadly, these slippers were not comfortable and hard to walk in beause they simply did not bend at all. They were too stiff and hard to be comfortable. A shame, because the material is very nice. But this company needs to learn how to make an indoor/outdoor sole that is flexible AND tough enough for driveway runs."
3,OK but not as good as I imagined...TOO STIFF!,The slippers were just OK...found them to be too stiff and not what I imagined.....I am looking for softer experience!
5,Very good product,"Luxurious fleece, a rubber sole to step put side with the trash and well constructed. I would recommend this product."
4,Good slippers,"I enjoy the comfort of slippers in the house, but find they don't last long - I rather think these are going to be surpassing my expectations - they are really well made, and very comfortable, fit snugly without pinching and feel luxurious.I will probably buy another pair, for spares."
5,Great!!,"They are soft and warm.. Just be carful with size, they come smaller than your size and being slippers you want to have room."
5,Best Slippers Ever,"Wow - These are a great buy! Super soft, easy to step into, and warm. The sizing for me was just right, but I usually fall between 1/2 sizes and by choosing my larger size it was ideal."
5,My husband loves these slippers!!!!,"My husband always insists on buying inexpensive slippers, but needs more foot support than he'd been getting. I persuaded him to accept (as a gift from me) the Tamarac clog model even they cost a bit more than the Isotoners he'd been wearing (and wearing out rapidly). They are a huge success, comfortable, warm, easy to slip into. Perfect!"
2,Too small,"I gave these to my husband as a Christmas gift and they were very small. I did not bother re-ordering but may have needed 2 sizes up, not sure."
3,Real suede slippers,"I like the slippers, but with only a few days of wearing them problems begin. The stiching of the sole is pulling loose. Loops are now large enough for a ink pen to pass through. I like the shoe and would like a replacement pair. Unfortunately my size is no longer in stock. I like them enough not to return for a refund only because they are my house slippers.Aside from the stitching they are of nice quality."
2,Fleeced,"The slippers by Tamarac are very nice looking and comfortable (as long as you buy a size or two bigger than you normally wear--and for a short while, anyway). The lining is not genuine sheep skin. It is some crappy synthetic fiber that rolls into little balls and/or tubes and, after a month or so of wearing, it will rapidly disappear--resulting in very cold and unhappy feet. I will never buy this product again."
3,Size runs small,"I was excited to recieve these. They looked very nice with soft inner soles. They were too small so I had to return them.I normally wear a size 8 men's shoe and at times even size 7.5. These were marked size 8, but they were just too small.I think I would have really liked them if they had fit me."
3,Noisy slippers,"Purchased these for my BF as a gift based on, for the most part, great reviews. He is pretty big on wearing slippers around the house so I wanted something of good quality, comfortable and durable. During the winter months, he always wears socks with his slippers. So for his normal 10.5 size shoe, I purchased the 11 and they fit just right with his socks on. I can not comment on the durability, but they did seem to be of good quality and he said they were very comfy. Unfortunately, they are very noisy on hard surfaced floors. We have laminate flooring through most of the house and he sounded like he was wearing hard shoes when he walked around. They sounded uncomfortable and it got very annoying. Another issue he had with them was that the coloring from the suede part of the slippers, stained his socks. After about a week of wearing them he decided to return them. For as much as they cost, he shouldn't have to deal with those issues."
4,Nice 'n' comfy,"Good, warm, comfortable slippers with a sole that lets you step outside. Only complaint I have is the left one is a bit tight in the width--but I think that's just me with my left foot being a wee bit wider than my right."
2,"great initially, but didn't last","I purchased these slippers for my husband in preparation for his back surgery. I believe these slippers, despite a higher cost would be an excellent choice. I felt the rubber soles, slip on open back and the lining would keep his feet warm, would be ideal for his hospital stay and recovery at home afterwards. Unfortunately, within a week of him wearing them, the backs have ripped and torn. They are still wearable, but not worth the $40. I could have just purchased any pair of slippers from any department store or base exchange."
5,Very Durable!,"Ever since I was a little girl, I always purchase slippers for my dad for Christmas. My dad absolutely loves these slippers. They last until the following Christmas. He wears them all the time so the fact they last that long is great. I highly recommend these slippers, especially to those that wear slippers all the time."
5,Comfy and Durable,"The best slippers I have owned. Get the next size up. I was hoping for a softer lining like the wicking lamb fleece, but for the money I can't complain."
5,Christmas tradition,I bought these slippers at Kohls one year for my husband and he loved them. Couldnt locate them until I found them on Amazon and now are a welcome gift every Christmas for all the men in my family.
4,"Finally, warm toes!","I'm glad I read the review on this product before I bought it. One person mentioned that the sizes run a little small, so I got a 1/2 size larger than what I normally would wear (I wear 11.5 so I got a 12). It's a perfect fit. It's important to do this because of the style of shoe. If the shoe is too small, the back part WILL cut into the bottom of your heal making this experience very unpleasant. I wish there was more cushion and it's kind of awkward for me to walk around because I'm not used to these slippers...but man-oh-man are my toes warm. My basement is freezing and I was looking for something to keep my feet very warm. So because of this, I rate this product a 4 out of 5."
4,Good slippers.,"I have had two pairs of similar slippers made by the now defunct Sharper Image in the past. These are easily as good if not better, although the lining is a bit warmer (?too warm) for my feet. Still, the are very comfortable and look good. They seem well made with good soles for walking about on hardwood floors. Slippers are the kind of product that you really need a bit of time with..Perhaps I'll come back and report on these again after a few months. So far, though, so good."
4,Great Slippers,I really like the product. Very warm and comfortable. I normally wear a size 10 shoe and I ordered an 11 based on the product review. I am glad I went with the bigger size. I would not want them any smaller.
5,I bought these for my husband-I stole them back,"These are so comfortable I some times wear them to the store, they look like shoes. I will buy these again and again, if mine ever wear out, quality."
5,Slippers,"They are the greatest slippers. Warm, comfortable, and the soles are durable for going outside."
4,Nice Slippers,Bought these for my husband at Christmas. He really likes them. He said they would be 5 star but the lining is already clumpng up in the footbed.
2,Stiff outsole,"The slippers feel fine on the feet. Didnt like the outsole as it wouldnt bend with the foot, casuing the slipper to flop around my foot as I used it. Gave it plenty of time to see if it would break in, even tried over bending the sole to facilitate break in. Nothing worked and was overall dis satisfied with the purchase."
4,"Took a little bit to stretch, but love them!","I bought these for a gift for my brother. He loves them... He had a tendancy to wear his slippers outside, and would even leave the house with them on not realizing he was wearing slippers to the store :)I got him these for Christmas, with the rubber sole, he can wear them outside (in VT, even in the snow) and not ruin them! He has since told me that he loves them. I wasnt sure if I believed him, he's too sweet to tell me if he didnt like them.We went to a meet and greet at our new neighbors this past week - and when I was taking my boots off in the mud room, I noticed his slippers, these slippers, were right there next to everyones boots! I believe him, he loves them! :)"
2,Narrow,"I normally wear 10D in most shoes; I ordered these in a men's 10.They were far too narrow. I wound up giving them to an 11 year old girl and though they were a bit long they fit her ok.They were also remarkably heavy, which I suppose could be seen as a sign of quality but which I personally found annoying; why would I want heavy slippers?If you can find a size that fits you and don't mind the weight you might like these as they seemed to be made well."
2,"Very comfy for first few minutes, then not so much","I have been having foot pain and bought these to wear around the house so I don't have to walk on bare tile/wood floors. My hope was that the memory foam would provide good support for my feet - but it did not. I felt like a thin layer on top of the soles of the slippers and there was no arch support at all. After wearing the slippers for an hour, my feet hurt more than when I before I put them on. Your mileage may vary."
3,great but run small,"Great slippers, but run small. My hubby wears a 10, I bought a 10, and I have to send back for the next size up"
4,Comfortable but a bit noisy,These slippers are very comfortable but the rubber/plastic bottom is a bit noisy on hard floors.
4,Comfy and Warm,"I ordered these slippers for my brother for Christmas. I ordered a size 11 in Black. The slippers shipped super fast. My brother likes them a lot. They are warm, comfortable, and true to size. He especially likes that he can wear them outside due to the rubber sole. Great slippers for the man who likes to be comfortable, but likes his slippers durable."
2,not for me and sizing issue,"just received them today and disappointed... I usually wear a 10.5 and was going to order a 11 but read some reviews and they advised a size smaller since the lining seemed to mesh down. Well the 10's are very snug plus the fact that the back is so low cut it will pretty much rub into your bottom of your heel. Maybe I should of ordered an 11, that might of helped, but as for now I will have to go through the process of sending back and getting a different pair. They do seem nice and comfy if the size was better, but also I just not a fan of the low back heel... And yes i realize it is a clog slipper, but just my 2 cents..."
1,Made from cow hide !!!,bought these thinking it was made from suede... as it says in the description. Open the package up and right on the box it says made from cow hide. i think this is something that should be in the description. not everyone wants to wear clothes/shoes made from a cow and i do not.this item is going back to Amazon.
4,Comfortable and Warm,Great slipper. Comfortable and keep your feet warm. Seem to be well made and I like the fact that the rubber sole comes up over the slipper a little so I can wear them outside to grab the paper in the snow without worrying about my feet getting wet. I wear a size 9.5 shoe and I got a 10 and they felt a little tight at first but feel fine now.
1,Awful. Inner lining comes out almost immediately,"Hate the fact that the inner lining comes out in patches almost immediately. Comfortable, but will be searching for a different slipper shortly. :("
4,Comfortable Slippers,This product is just what I needed for the cold winter mornings and nights. Very comfortable and long lasting. My daughter bought a pair for me four years ago. I wear them constantly when I'm at home. Outside and inside. Just replaced them.
2,Not as nice as before,"I bought this brand of slipper for my father about 4-5 years ago. I just ordered him another pair, and the quality has definitely plummetted. The stiching isn't as clean, and it just looks cheaper. I was definitely disappointed. All this Made In China stuff is awful...costs go up, quality goes down. When is it going to end? I guess I'll wait and see what my dad thinks of this slippers this time around..."
3,"Very comfortable, but heal is wearing out.","I've had these now for about 6 months. I wear them exclusively around my house. The heel on the inside of the show has lost it's fur and is showing signs of splitting. I am 6'1"" and weigh about 195lbs."
1,Video is poorly done and lacks bibliographical facts.,"Although this video alludes to ""facts"" being presented, except for a few cited biblical verses, there is no bibliography to substantiate their research. You are shown yellow highlighted text from some un-named books and told these are facts. Some of the historical information given is totally inaccurate such as the reference to the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaton of the 18th dynasty. They claim this King declared Amen-Ra as the only true god of Egypt and did away with the pantheon of lesser gods. When, in fact, Akhenation did away with Amen-Ra and proclaimed Aton as the only god of Egypt. These people need to get their facts straight. This is only one example, there are many. Mind you, the basic premise of what they are trying to reveal has credence, and there is actually a great deal of historical facts to substantiate it, but Maxwell & Company have missed the mark. This video is not worth watching."
3,Gidget (1959),"This was a present fof my wife. The quality was as expected, even playing in the U.K. She was nine years old when she first watched it, and thinks that maybe memories are sometimes better than reality. All in all though a good film for it's age."
3,Aspect Ratio 1954,"This was a funny movie. I lived through those days in black and white. I looked at several studios and one that made theHarry Potter Years 1-6 Giftset (Widescreen Edition)movies sold in wide screen ratio, but really cut the top and bottom off the film to look like it is real 2.35:1 aspect ratio. These days, it is difficult to tell what is being ""ripped-off"" the original films, or when it happens. This is something that I do not have time to look for. ""It is up to you, now!"" Anyway, away with the melo-dramatic and understand that widescreen or larger aspect ratios, did not come into existence until -TA-TA-TAAAAA 1954!"
5,The Best,"This is by far the best of all the Gidget movies. Sandra Dee is and will always be ""the Gidget"". She is cute, perky, and made me wish for brown eyes to go with my blonde hair!!! Too bad colored contacts hadn't been invented in 1960.I am a teacher and used this movie several years ago with a unit on the beach. It was shown to a bunch of street wise multicultured children and they LOVED it!!! We had to rush through lunch to get back to the classroom to see what happened to the ""little tomboy""! Gidget will never grow old!"
4,Pretty nice,This watch is performing well. I bought this as a gift item and till now I did not hear any negatives on this watch.I hope it is working as its name brand.
4,Great Condition from Seller,"Once again, I am satisfied with the sellers on Amazon. I've been buying textbooks for school on Amazon and every time I am extremely satisfied with the products. This book came in great condition as if new and it came in the correct time frame proposed."
3,THinking,"THis book is okay, however does not seem to incorporate many of the more important aspects of cognitive science."
2,Laguna max-flo 800,"Yes, I said 800. You can't find the 800 series of this pump? All you have to do is order the 900, the 800 is hidden in the box. Too bad there wasn't room for the 900 too.Hagen says it's 900 GPH, the sellers say it's 900 GPH, but the pump says it's 800GPH."
5,Laguna Max-Flo 1500 Pump,I have not hooked up the pump yet as it is to cold outside to be flowing water in my pond.I hope to have it hooked up by the end of April.
5,a really good pump,I bought this pump to replace one just like it that I had run for years 24/7. i never had to clean it as it ground up everything and pumped it into my filter which took care of it. If the new one does as well I'll be very pleased
5,Works great. Low energy usage,"My pond is just under 1000 gallons and this pump pushed plenty of water to the top section of my pond for the waterfall. Even better, I barely noticed a difference in the electric bill. Maybe a few dollars per month."
2,Died 6 months out of warranty,"I have one of these in a small pond, and it worked great for the last 3 years, now the motor keeps cutting out. Of course, it's just 6 months past the warranty."
3,informations,I am looking for informations about places where I can find glory holes in Belgium and in Holland
3,Not the corgi we used to play with,"Bought this for my daughter who likes my old Corgi toys. Have the older ones like the batmobile, James Bond Austin Martin. This looks similiar but not build very well compared to the older toys. For the price, not bad but would have paid a few more dollars for better quality."
4,impala ss 2008,"hi good night, that I wonder if a spare is a 2008 Chevrolet Impala SS and I Want adquirilo thanks, and I have doubts about the product since I'm from Venezuela"
1,Sent to wrong address,"In the order, I provided my P.O. Box 696, Crescent City, Florida 32112 address. And some how, the book was sent to my previous address of 7905 Gambrill Ct., Springfield, Va. 22153, even though I had never provided that address. Shows me that brains are shut off and products are shipped wereever with out any regard for correctness."
1,Not as described,Sorry but the ad for this item said the book was in large print. It is not. I kept it because I was told they don't have one in large print. This is really the first time I have had any problem at all with Amazon. Usually everything is just great. Service and prices
2,Poor Planning?,"With the elections approaching there are going to be a lot of changes in the House, Senate and among the nation's governors. Printing this almanac before the results of the election effectively makes a large portion of this book worthless."
1,Some facts are just plain wrong,"For this type of book I would expect it to at least be accurate. This book is nothing more than a consumer rip off. It has a few interesting facts but is no where complete and certainly not accurate. In most cases the source of the facts is not given. In a few cases the top whatever was made up by the books editors. In some case actual data is given as tow different numbers on the very same page. I won't tell you where but if you should happen to have this book, one case is in the backing industry section."
4,"Good Product, Good Price, Good Vendor","The first laser I ordered was DOA, the replacement was sent quickly with an apology, includes a warranty in writing which is honored without question.The only reason I gave 4/5 is due to the delicate nature of these lasers, they have a limited temperature range at which they'll operate, although this lithium powered version had the widest operating range at the time. They also are easily damaged by an unlucky medium shock. These issues are not due to this laser alone, but all green lasers due to their design."
3,cardinal laboratories crazy dog powder shampoo,This smells wonderful...it is reasonable but the container is too small. I would recommend you sell it in larger containers.
3,It's OK so far,"Web research scared me away from ""The Bedazzler"", but my 9-year old niece really wanted one. And the research said the GemMagic was better so I decided to try it. Her mother, not a crafter, couldn't make it work and got extremely frustrated. But I was able to figure it out in about 10 minutes and my niece caught on right away and has probably used every jewel by now. It does take a little bit of strength to push down the jewel; our machine seems slightly misaligned with the bottom plate. But for $20, my niece is happily bedazzling everything in sight. Overall, not a bad buy."
5,A good book,"very good book! Has all the qualaties for a good star wars book! Very action packed! If you love Han Solo as much as I do, This book is for you!"
4,Bre's,"Firstly, I'd like to say that I really enjoyed this book. A.C. Crispin is a great writer. I felt that Han was really well represented, along with his relationship with Chewbacca. The author has done a marvellous job incorporating every single smuggling buddy Han has ever been recorded to have. The bit with the fortune-teller was a nice touch."
2,Crispin fails to reveal true Han Solo,"There are so many possibilities to create a truly interesting history of one of the most popular characters in science fiction history, Han Solo. Unfortunately, the author is shackled by what is expected of her as a science fiction author, that she doesn't allow herself to tell us who Han Solo is. Instead, we get Han and Chewbacca thrown into a contrived plot we've seen a thousand times before, with ham- fisted dialogue. Crispin also feels the need to have coincidental encounters with characters within the Star Wars trilogy. Obviously, Lando and Chewbacca are necessary, but can we learn about what drives Han and Chewbacca's partnership before we put han face to face with Boba Fett? The only interesting aspect of the book was Han's time spent in the Academy, which contained a painfully small amount of information."
5,A GREAT BOOK !!! Now I know how all this started ...,"COULDN'T STOP READING !!! A.C. CRISPIN did a great job. After reading THE HUTT GAMBIT you know how all those people met. It's even greater with the background knowledge of the movies and all the other SW books. Hope to get REBEL DAWN (Vol. 3) soon. MAYBE THE LAST LINES IN ""REBEL DAWN"" WILL BE : ... but right now I got other things to do, Chewie and I were just hired up to transport some people to Alderan. Looks like easy money ...May the force be with you ... always"
3,Midly Entertaining,"This book, though midly entertaining, is not for the old school Star Wars fans that grew up on the original Trilogy. The Han Solo Trilogy lacks the stories of a scoundrel that I expected. This trilogy also has glaring contradictions and plot holes when taken with the movies and other Star Wars books. This book is for the younger Star Wars fan, the generation that believes Greedo shot first."
4,a verry on the edge of your seat book!!!,I liked the hutt gambit because it was so exiting i couldn't put the book down. i think that every one should read it.
5,very good book!loved it!,"a.c.crispin is a great writer.i've read the whole trilogy,but this is my favorite book of all.so realistic!and in the book ""tales from the mos eisley cantina""the story about muftak and kabe is my favorite"
4,Review,In the second book of the series Han Solo loses his Imperial military status after saving the slave wookie Chewbacca. Chewie fallows Han around until Han finally excepts him as a partner and friend. The Ylesian priests also have the mighty Boba Fett on Han's trail. To make things worse Han gets a job flying for Jiliac and Jabba the Hutt. Will things turn out okay or will it go down the drain for Han?
2,"Please, no more ""kindler, gentler"" Han Solo","Ann Crispin's ""Han Solo Trilogy"" fills out some interesting details of the Star Wars universe. However, it lacks the edge and grittiness of some of the better Star Wars novels (particularly those by Timothy Zahn). Although Han is supposed to be a ""scoundrel,"" you'd never know it from these books; Crispin goes out of her way to portray him as a nice, sweet guy who might enjoy an afternoon feeding ducks in the park.""The Hutt Gambit"" feels almost like a young-adult novel; the dialogue is bright and cheerful and the characters never seem to be in any serious jeopardy. If you thought Greedo shooting first was an improvement, you'll probably enjoy this."
1,"CD ROM is really, really bad","I have my PRAXXIS 1 coming up, and I installed this disk to review with. It is absolute garbage. Totally outdated, it presents a ""flash card"" on the computer and tells you to write the answer down on paper. Then you flip the card and click yes if you answered correctly or no if you did not. Truly a waste of money, I bought a book at the same time and the book is 150% better than this crap. Buyer beware!"
2,Not what i thought!,"Bought this, thinking i could carry cards around to study on the go....its a program for computers! Very out dated too!"
4,Just OK,"This cloth can get all the smudges and fingerprints off out your guitar without fear scratching or anything like that. However, it's not super easy like they advertise it to be and it tends to smear fingerprints around quite a bit before they come off. For 10 bucks on amazon it's a pretty good buy, but at the regular price of 15 would not be worth it."
4,Cutest boots ever!!!,"I bought matching mother daughter fringe boots and they are SO cute!! The are exceptionally cute on my daughter, but I can rock them too :) They are also super comfortable, but have yet to walk many miles in them. Especially in the salty winters of NE. Hopefully they will withstand.. they are so darn cute!"
5,Beautiful boots!,These boots are very well made and my daughter seems comfortable in them. They look cute with skirts and leggings.
3,my granddaughter loved them but...,the stitching came apart in the back and now that she's worn them how do you clean them? They need directions on cleaning.
5,A Nice Fashion Treat,"I bought these for three nieces - two 11 year olds, one 8 year old - and they were quite a success."
5,WE LOVE THESE BOOTS,I got these for my daighter and they look SO cute on her feet. They go with lots of pieces that she has. They're the same color as shown and they add a nice flair to a normally boring outfit. I would highly recommend these.
5,Minnetonka boot,The fringed boots couldn't be cuter. My 6 year old granddaughter loved them and said they felt like slippers. They came on time and were exactly what I expected!
3,"Very Cute, but order with caution.","I loved these boots but they are smaller than our other Minnetonka boots and with the zipper down the back, my daughters foot that's a little on the wide side,wouldn't go in at all. So as long as your child has a narrowish foot, you should be fine and you may have to use trial and error on the sizing. Someone said they were too big and in my experience they were too small. Good Luck!"
1,Manufacturing flaw,"Bad product. I bought the Blue ones last year 2007. I was extremely happy until a couple of months ago when the tip of the back left hand glove touched the oven shelf as I was removing a roasted chicken. The Glove fused to the metal and is therefore useless. I called Silicone zone and the very helful young lady replaced them immediately. However, 2 nights ago, the same thing happened. The back of the left glove. This time the man on the other end of the phone was most unhelpful even to the point of suggesting I touched the electric element (I use propane) in the oven. I will not be buying any more of their products, period. Lifetime Warranty evidently is the lifetime of the product and not the user."
3,a chance to relive high school,"I believe that this was a great chance to fall back into the teen dilemas that we knew in high school. It you take the time to get into the book you can relate the characters to people you know and the story becomes a ""real life"" episode."
1,Why writer when there is nothing to say,"AS an individual who has made some decent money writing professionally, I cannot stand self publishing vanity presses!Thanks to pay-to-publish houses we have seen unreadable book after unreadable book from writers who didn't even seem to bother to try and go the professional route. The worst part of this type of publishing is that there are no editors to tell you your book has no story.The pretentiously named ""Road to the Heart,"" can now be thrown in this heap. With such a title the reader expects emotion and a fresh look at the human condition. What we have here is a poorly written book about one-dimensional characters that we don't care about.I have to agree with on of the reviews, which wonders how anyone, (outside the author's family),can give the book 1 star let alone 4.Please, no more vanity publishing!"
2,Slow to Dry and difficult to remove in cool weather,"I have used various car waxes over the years, but wanted a good quality wax for my sports car. I applied black magic on a cool fall day, 52 deg outside. It never really dried enough to buff. I let it haze over, but when I went to remove it, it was oily underneath and left swirl marks. It took a lot of time and a lot of effort to get this stuff off the car. Perhaps it needs to be applied at higher temperatures.I contacted their technical help and learned that the waxy residue that was difficult to remove is the silicone component. It doesn't dry well at low temperatures. Once I got the stuff off, the shine was great and it's lasted well. I'll try again in warmer weather. The shine is really good."
2,wax on wax off wax off wax off wax off wax off...........................,"wax on is easy but it never seems to dry to a haze, making it very hard to wax off. to i will admit it looks nice if you have a lot of time and many towels to polish it.it was a humid day and maybe that had something to do with it.to review, i would say this wax is too much trouble for me."
4,black magic - wet shine liquid wax,"pros : great price , shine is fantastic , lasts thru many rainstorms , it does hold better than many more expensive waxes.cons : pain in the @$$ to come off! especially when you have a black car. streaks and swirls depending on the way you applied this wax to your car will STILL definitely show unless you put on a lot of elbow grease to buff it out.* i found a great trick though to speed up the buffing process. after the wax has come to a haze and then you have buffed it to where you think it has smoothed out... i then go over the wax with a quick detailer spray like ""Meguiar's Ultimate Quik Detailer"" using a very soft terry cloth. it will totally get rid of all those streaks and swirls left over alot faster then if you weren't to use one.as hard as it was to get the shine, overall though i think its still worth it."
2,"Easy on, difficult off","After reading all the reviews, I had to try it. Well, it went on easy enough and cleaned up smudges in the paint that didn't come out in the wash. BUT... never set up well. It gummed up my terry cloth buffer to the point I had to throw it away. Used up 4 more buffers before I got it all off. The car finally had a nice shine when I got all the gummy residue off. We'll see how long it lasts... But I won't be using it again."
5,Rated Number 1 by Consumer Reports,"This, and Turtle Wax Carnauba Car Wax T-6 tied for number 1 in the June or July 2006 issue of Consumer reports."
4,Impresive,"I am really impressed after using it. Easy to apply, last long, provides nice shining with smooth layer.Recommend this product. Only thing also buy accessories to use it."
4,Good wax,"I bought a bottle of this locally (not from amazon) based off of reviews here and in Consumer Reports. I was waxing on a 70 degree day in sunlight and it hazed in about a minute. Used microfiber pads for applying, microfiber towel for buffing. Didn't have any problems using it. I was certainly worn out afterwards, but I did wash, dry, and wax a car after all.It's still on after about a month or so. We'll see how long it lasts. My only complaint is that it didn't make my car quite as shiny as I was expecting. For those with ""gummy"" problems, you might try purchasing it locally, instead of through Amazon."
3,"Buff, Buff, Buff and Buff some more","I've been a Nufinish man for years, but Consumer Reports recently rated the Black Magic tied for first. It went on easily enough, but like the guy who gave it a one said, it doesn't seem to ever set up. I buffed the car for a good hour (both with a buffer and by hand), and I still have streaks. Maybe I put it too thick... I don't know. Oh well, I'll see how it lasts before I rule out using it again."
3,"Not my cup of tea, but may be yours if you like DeMille","After reading the glowing review in Publisher's Weekly, I decided to try out this book. I'm unfamiliar with the series books by this author, but I'm finding Ask A Dead Man to be pretty rough going. I've had to put it down and read 2 or 3 other books since starting it. The writing reminds me of Nelson DeMille, who provided an enthusiastic blurb. I only read one of DeMille's books, and found it equally hard to get into. I know he's very popular, though, so I assume that some people can't get enough of him. If you are one of those people, you might like this book, too.For me, it's too much tell and not enough show. The female characters ring particularly false to me. All of the women are beautiful, striking, once-beautiful, or faded beauties. All of the men are daring and handsome, except the villains. At over 400 pages, this one is too much like work."
4,Wonderful,This was a really good book. This author makes her characters very down to earth and believable even though they are the elite members of society!
4,Slightly Series Books,Serial story of the Bedwyn Family each story in the series is an excellent read. Can 't wait to read the rest of the series.
3,Nice...,This book was pretty good except I hate the way Judith's family treats her. They treat her like a dog with such disrespect. And Rannulf doesn't like it and actually his actions say so. This book is hott and sexy but it just wasn't one of my favorites of the Slightly series.
4,Another Bedwyn Breaktrhough!!!!!!,"I have to say I found this one to be very fast paced startig at the begining. Which is just fine wit me, I hate those romance novels that have the character's wait forever to meet. Sheesh! It didn't have the intensity all through it like some other Bedwyn romances did. There were times I found myself feeling so upset for poor Judith. But eventually it pulled through in the end....Another satisfied couple!"
1,I give up,"I tried to be fair but after the first few pages of this book I knew there was no way I was ever going to pick up another Balough book.I cannot relate to her writing at all. I was not disappointed because I had very low expectations but I really resent authors who seem to make a mockery of their fans by writing incredulous stories and expect us to enjoy because it is fiction.Oh well I guess it is a good thing that I'm so terribly spoiled by the likes of Judith Mcnaught, Mary Jo putney and Gaelen Foley. All of who take the time to write mature stories for their ADULT READERS and making sure enough research of the genre is done to not have us doubt it when we pick up one of their books to read.All three copies of Mary Balough's book in my library are not fit to be on the same shelf as the above mentioned authors, therefore they shall keep the trash can company."
2,This DVD Should Be Much Better,"Censorship bars in the Justify My Love and Erotica videos. Overly compressed video to fit on single-layer discs instead of dual-layer. No anamorphic formatting for the widescreen videos. Looks crappy on a big TV.Shame on you, Madonna and Warner Brothers."
1,Shame!!!!!,"Do not buy this! Warner stated uncensored version of Justify My Love and this actually has the censored version!!! Also, has the censored version of Erotica. The remastering looks terrible due to using single layer DVD's, not dual layer and the sound mix of the Dolby 5.1 is poor sounding.....more like a matrix 5.1 track. Also, missing many key videos!!! Warner needs to recall this piece of crap and give it the proper job it deserves!!! Amazon shouldn't even sell this!!!!"
4,Come on!! It's about the videos,"In reading the reviews posted on Amazon about how poorly this DVD was made. I was like wow can it be that bad? I am a true Madonna fan from way back in the day and continue to be a ""True Blue"" Fan. First...It is not bad at all visual and the audio. I bought the Greatest hits CD first and a voice in my head said...you have all this and then some at home, just return the CD for the DVD, but after reading some of the reviews on here, I was thinking about not getting the DVD at all. HEADLINE: I can tell you I am happy with exchange for the DVD. It is what it is. No complaints at all!!!! If you don't have all main video's get it and enjoy it! Be a fan not a critic.Celebrate life not hate!"
3,Let's play a game...,"I like alot of these videos, but you know what a fun game to play while watching this is. From the beginning of disc one to the end of disc two, every time Madonna spreads her legs take a shot of vodka or any other hard alcohol. I promise you will be sloshed before the end of Lucky Star (Video 2). Or if you like, put in the second disc and start it with Music and every time Madonna makes out with someone that looks like they could be about half her age, take a shot. You'll be a full fledged alcoholic by the end of the set."
3,Half A Celebration! MISSING VIDEOS,"Where are, The Gambler, Everybody, Keep It Together,Love Don't Live Here Anymore, and the beautiful Nothing Really Matters?WARNER BROTHERS GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER! IF YOUR GOING TO CELEBRATE HER LIFES WORK, THEN MAKE IT HER COMPLETE WORKS UNTIL HER CURRENT RELEASE."
2,"Great Videos, Wonderful Sound, Terrible Video","It's mind boggling why some notable videos are absent (Drowned World, Nothing really matters, Oh Father, Fever, American Life). The videos that are here are mostly great and represent a genuine music revolution that we now take for granted. The sound has been remastered wonderfully. These videos have never sounded so good. The problem is that they have never looked so bad. Seriously they are VHS quality at best. The compression is terrible. Everything is fuzzy and there is frequent pixel problems. Warner Brothers should be ashamed for putting out such a dreadful product. You'd think an artist of Madonna's stature would warrant a higher quality release, but it is what it is. In addition to very poor video quality there are no liner notes, commentaries or background information about the videos."
5,VIDEO CONCERNS,"I HAD SAW ALL THE REVIEWS FOR AMAZON REGARDING THE VIDEO QUALITY AND I HAD DECIDED TO CHECK OUT THE VIDEO FOR MYSELF. ONE THING THAT MADONNA LOVERS REMEMBER IS THAT THESE VIDEOS WERE MADE IN THE 80'S.. IN A TIME WHERE DVDS AND HD AND 1080P'S DIDNT EXIST. THESE VIDEOS ALL ARE OF GOOD QUALITY.. YOU DO SEE A DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU WATCH THE NEWER ONES, BUT I THINK OTHERS VIEWERS EXPECTATIONS WERE WAY TOO OVERDRAWN. SO IF YOU'RE NOT A HD ONLY TYPE OF PERSON THESE VIDS ARE GREAT. ITS DEFINTELY A COLLECTION WORTH HAVING FROM THE QUEEN OF POP. I HAVE BEEN A MADONNA FAN SINCE DAY ONE AND IT IS REALLY INTERESTING TO WATCH THESE FROM START TO FINSH AND TO SEE THE TRANSFORMATION UNFOLD."
2,Censored & Poor Quality About Sums It Up,"I decided to rent this first because of all the negative comments. Well, the quality isn't very good and the censorship on Justify My Love was painful to watch. I remember buying that VHS when I was just a little kid (trust me I'd seen worse in National Geographic by then). It's a nice collection don't get me wrong, but like so many others have said it needs to be dual layer higher quality sans censorship."
3,5 Stars for content...1 Start for CENSORSHIP!,"While content of this collection has many previously unreleased videos, Warner has no concept of who this product would be marketed to. I truly love the retrospective collection. This is not a product for the casual Madonna music lover but true fans. Videos are censored...A VERY, VERY POOR DECISION if this was to be marketed to true fans. And shame on the Material Girl for allowing her art to be censored."
3,Madonna Celebration the Video Collection,"As I wrote about the CD: the song list is very obvious and nothing special about it. Some of the clips are bad quality video, no extras with this DVD."
2,VHS quality when everyone has HD TV's? Not good.,"I agree with the other reviewers about the quality of these videos, very poor! Might have been ok in the 80's but this in this day and age, everyone has HDTV's and others watch videos on their computers ... even Youtube has HD! C'mon Warner, at least TRY to give incentives for people not to download pirated material!"
2,What's going on with this video collection!!!,"Honest, what happened here? This is a great collection, I didn't want to buy the dvd's to wait for the blu-ray but no one knows anything about it, what is really weird is that warner strongly supports this format. Like someone else said, i also played it on an upscaled blu-ray player and lcd screen and the picture quality is awful. Really, we're in 2009 and i know of many people who has waited for this compilation. REMASTERED FROM ORIGINAL TAPES ""I DON'T THINK SO!!!"""
1,Horrible video quality,"I would not recommend purchasing this DVD. The picture quality is terrible. I have the 93-99 collection on DVD, which shares some of the same videos. The difference in quality is pronounced. This DVD has a grainy picture quality that would be surpassed by VHS. What a disappointment. These are some of the most notable videos in the history of music videos. They deserve a much better treatment. Hopefully a remastered video collection will be released at some point in the future."
2,Not Worth It,Whats the Point?The Immaculate Collection is better than this crap.It actually has music videos that show what madonna is about.this just shows u how good madonna used to be to the crap she has become Entering the 2000's.
1,Low quality You-Tube Footage! POOR QUALITY PICTURE!,This DVD was a WASTE OF MONEY! The quality looks like cheap bootlets recorded off TV! What a waste of what could have been a good quality product! Also - no American Life video on this collection!
2,Good Collection but picture quality is bad,Generally contains good collection but missing some. However the picture quality is very bad. I got better quality using my VCR to record her MTV on tv more than 10 years ago. The quality is grainy and looks to me more like VCD quality rather than DVD.
2,The collection is so incomplete - still 12 classic tracks missing!!!,1. Holiday (live concert version)2. Love don't live here anymore3. Bad girl4. Fever5. This used to be my playground6. American Life7. Nothing really matters8. Dress You Up9. Oh Father10. You must love me11. Don't cry for me Argentina12. Drowned WorldAnd like many many other fans have said here - the image quality is so~~o terrible! I have to think like this: Warner Bros. wanted to make a quick money with the last deal with Madonna. And Warner Bros ruined this DVD release. Don't you think so?
1,It's 2009!,"In this time of advanced DVD technology and Hi-Def, how can Warner release this piss poor transfers of Madonna Videos. This was highly anticipated and Warner dropped the ball. Why do studios keep doing this. Punish them by not buying this version and make them do it correctly. People work to hard to make money, Warner should respect their customers and do it right the first time. Send them a message and DON'T BUY."
1,madonna's incomplete video collection. but waitt theres hope,"I have read everyone's disappointment with this terribly incomplete set. I did not buy this for a reason. All Madonna's videos are available on thepoppalace.com. Its a 7 disc set. It has justify my love,erotica,and american life uncencored. It also has tons of live footage. It goes all the way to 4 min to save the world. Current vids from mdna are available in other compilations. The set is $50. The quality is exellent."
3,This is WB fault Not Madonna's,"I would bet this was WB's way of saying "" F==K You "" to Madonna, remember she left them after Hard Candy , and this was the last project with them. I have not seen the DVD but after reading all the reviews of the terrible quality, I would guess it's Warner Bros' way of saying good-bye with a middle finger. If you notice the Celebration 25 year singles the edits are absolutely horrendous. A twelve year old could do better on PC music editing software."
3,for the man with a censured heart,"Great videos in their original form, cant help but notice some have been censured. whats worse is the rather notable omissions of a few videos (nothing really matters, and american life) really? y?!?!"
4,It's Madonna,"There may be a number of videos missing from the collection, but I am not disappointed in ordered it. I have Immaculate Collection and the 93-99 video collection, so when I wanted to fill in some blanks, I was happy to order the collection. The quality is about the same as the duplicates on the other collections and some are edited (prudes) but until a fully complete collection of Madonna music videos comes out, this will have to suffice, along with the others I previously mentioned."
2,Un-Celebration,"The poor sales of the dvd and cd is proof that fans are fed up with Madonna and WB Records. Negative word of mouth and disappointed fan reviews have spreaded so fast, I am sure both Madonna and WB records heads are spinning! Even though some fans claim that Madonna had nothing to do with the quality of her Celebration dvd, I beg to differ. SHe signed off on this along with WB because I suspect they plan to release a BETTER version of Madonna videos in the future. The quality of this dvd is just T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E! The tracks sound awful! Justify My Love and Erotica are both censured (can you believe that?)!!Plus, its missing key videos!My motto is: ""If you do something, do it RIGHT the first time""! Clearly WB and Madonna dropped the ball on this release!"
5,Beware: Artist At Work,"One has only to screen Madonna's music videos to know why she is hailed as the QUEEN! Her videos all stand the test of time. No, she did not invent the music video but she elevated it to an ArtForm! No other artist has done justice to this medium. All her videos are inventive and alluring. Other celebrated ""video artists"" resort to the same old dance moves that I guess have become their signature but become tedious and repetitive, that cannot be said of Lady Madonna. LONG LIVE THE QUEEN!!!"
5,You know you love her!,"Celebration: The Video Collection by Madonna contains 47 groundbreaking music videos from the Queen of Pop. Of course not all of Madge's fabulous videos are included like: This Used to be My Playground, Bad Girl, Nothing Really Matters, You Must Love Me, Oh Father, and Drowned World. Overall, I think this collection is great - I had no problem with the picture quality or audio. Frozen is my favorite Madonna video of all-time! She looked so gorgeous and tranquil in that video. I am glad to have Erotica and Justify My Love in this collection even though some parts are censored. No matter how terrible I am feeling, Madge can put a smile on my gloomy face. Long live the Queen!!!"
2,BAD PICTURE,I LOVE MADONNA BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PICTURE QUALITY HERE??? COME ON WARNER BROTHERS RESPECT THE FANS AND ACTUALLY REMASTER THE DVD'S!!!
1,Good music. BAD VIDEO,"I bought this DVD recently. I love madonna and I have others dvd, like The Immaculation Collection and Madonna video Collection 1993 - 99I don't understand why Warner choose the 4:3 letter box format instead the 16:9. I don't understando too why Warner don't sell this colection in Blu-ray.Other point is the picture quality. It's very, very bad. Even if we compare with the DVDs IImmaculation Collection and Madonna Video Collection that were made years ago.Why Warner don't put subtitles with the music lyrics like we have in the others two DVDs?It seems that all technology invented to bring us more content in a media like DVD or Blu-ray fails when faces the economic politics of the WARNER.PLEASE MADONNA, I BEG TO YOU. DON'T LET THE WARNER SELLs S**T WITH YOUR NAME. WE WANT TO BUY THE BEST THAT MADONNA HAS TOO OFFER. THE BEST IMAGE, THE BEST SOUND.There are videos with better quality in the internet tha we can download ""FREE"". So don't push us to internet again."
5,NOT A COMPLETE COLLECTION,It's a great collection but we are still missing some video's what aboutFeverNothing really matterEverybodyDress you upBad girlI think they would have still have space on the dvds too add this videos I wonder what was the problem with not add in this great video's
5,I WANT TO RULE THE WORLD!!,"I'll never forget the first time I saw Madonna on American Bandstand and she said, ""I want to Rule the World!"" Great job Madge!! You've done just that! Highest grossing tour by a single artist EVER and she is still touring and all of this is a bad economy! I LOVE the new single and kids if you listen real close you will hear that she's singing to Jesus!! Smart, Clever, Fun, Dance Music, and she references her whole career in the lyrics. She says, ""Get on your mark, Step to the beat boy that's what it's for!"" and you KNOW she means it!! Can't wait for the album and DVD!!"
5,It took me back.,"""Know Where You Going?"" took by back to where I came from. Not city and state but cultural roots with forgotten words and phrases. When I read them, I ""heard"" them. Immediately phrases like ""Going to the country"", ""Being a 4-H'er"", ""Go outside in Grandma's front yard and play"" carried me back to my childhood.This book also gave a feel for how some of our families migrated. It was nice to have a first hand account of where they came from and where they went.Easy read with great information.Ersula Knox OdomAuthor of""At Sula's Feet""At Sula's Feet""Ersula's Essays""Ersula's Essays I (The Past Meets The Present)""Here's 50""Here's 50"
2,Not what I expected....,"When I saw Off Da Hook Hip Hop Aerobics for sale I purchased it right away...I had been waiting for a workout tape with some flava to it. But after watching it once, I have to say that I am pretty disappointed. There are some dance moves that may work out parts of your body but I didn't feel the 'aerobics' part of the workout at all. Definitely not a workout for people that are really trying to lose weight....maybe if you just want to get your body warmed up with some dance moves. But don't bring these dance moves to the club...Also, the music was not the hip hop that I expected. Overall, I think this workout lacks professionalism and did not give me the workout that I expected."
3,"Circuit, a lovely source for veneer info only","This issue is a prime example of the problem with dvd ""periodicals"": they will long outlast their necessity.Sure, I love Hooverphonic, but how many times will I swoon over Geike and listen to their acoustic performance of, ""Mad About You""? My guess, 4 times. How many times will I kick back to the strummings of Ryan Adams? Mojave 3? Hey, I'd say 3. Is it worth the $..? Actually, no.As anyone who buys real magazines will tell you, the cover may be slick and the photos hot (this one makes noise and has moving pictures) but 5 months from now, you're going to have a stack and as so many issues of Details and Rolling Stone, you're not going to know what to do with them.Purchase only in instances of extreme fandom, collector frenzy or in cases of need for ""everything"" a particular artist has to offer."
5,Captures essence of sufi music,"Another great recording by Kudsi Erguner, one of the masters of the Turkish ney. His playing is flowing and exact throughout the entire CD, and features great improvisation on some of the basic maqamat. For people not familiar with the maqamat, the middle eastern system of microtonal modes, this is a great introduction. The artist builds the improvisation in each track on a different maqam, and shows the unique mood and sound of each mode. The music is very relaxing and mystical, and the sounds always remind me of Istanbul!"
4,"Nice, basic book.","While the flushing sound is somewhat annoying, the chart on the last page was fun for my daughter to fill out. We bought several potty training type books and I would say that overall, my daughter liked this one best."
5,Seeing Castro Plain,"Montaner has written the best book of the dozens I have read on Castro's Cuba. With humor, dry wit, impeccable research, and a straight-forward writing style, journalist Montaner explains the ideological and personal demons that rule Castro, the origins of the Cuban Revolution, and the 40-plus years of disasters that have befallen the Cuban people since their ""liberation."" He is unsparing in his criticism of United States ineptitude in handling Castro's Cuba, but recognizes that Castro, and Castro alone, bears ultimate responsibility for Cuba's distress. This is a wonderful book, written for anyone and everyone with curiosity about Cuba, the Cold War, and the nature of modern political evil. I literally could not put the book down, and read it in one sitting."
5,Works perfect for 1996 grand cherokee 4.0,"when I purchased my 1996 grand cherokee 4.0 the check engine light was on because there wasn't an oxygen sensor so I purchased this oxygen sensor (much cheaper than the parts stores). It came with anti-seize already on the threads so all I had to do was remove the plug in the catalytic converter, screw this in, plug the connector in and cleared the engine codes (i did this by removing the neg cable for 5-10 mins). No more check engine light. Works great!"
3,Good but not Captivating,"Let us start with a few warnings about this review before I delve into the meat of it. First, I do not read many mysteries. I ended up stopping part way through the book to pick up another novel. I was also expecting different use of more familiar characters.The first 100 pages were used to develop the characters, the setting, and the motives of the multiple suspects. Once I pushed past my personal preconceived ideas of this book, I was able to enjoy the mystery much better. The mystery developed very well and the reveal satisfied me. All the clues were well placed through out the story and easy to bring to conclusion.The story was good but the writing seemed simple. I think the need to develop the large ensemble of characters forced the writers to use stereotypes for many of players and a few even seem to be over used. The story telling required for this story was excellent and I think that alone allowed me to drive through to the end."
4,Fusion genre.,"What we have here is a traditional courtroom drama, set in the Star Trek universe. There is only a brief cameo appearance by the crew of the Enterprise; mostly, the book centers around Sam Cogley, the lawyer who defended Captain Kirk in the TV episode ""Courtmartial"". The book is well-written and interesting, but if you read ""Star Trek"" books for the characters of the Enterprise crew, this book is not for you. Similarly, if you enjoy courtroom dramas, but don't care for science fiction, this book is probably not for you. If, on the other hand, you enjoy both science fiction AND courtroom drama, this is a definite must-read."
4,Fast and fun,"My 5 year old loves his four wheeler! This ATV is fast and needs a large room to zoom it around in. The headlights didn't work, which he was disappointed in, but overall it seems fun and hasn't broke yet. Easy for him to control. The rider comes off to play with as well."
4,Who are these guys? Doesn't matter.,"This is a great CD from a great band that I have never heard of. My dad bought me this CD in Belgum and I was shocked when I heard it. I was like, ""Damn this is good stuff."" I don't think I took it out of my player for two weeks. The guitar work is exelent as is the drumming. The singing stands out as spectacular to me as does the melodies. I still know very little about the band D.A.D. but I understand they are huge in Belgum.Good Clean Family Entertainment is a compelation CD from the band's recordings between 85 and 95.Last I checked Amazon didn't even have the song titles up so here they are.Sleeping My Day AwayBad CrazinessJihadGrow Or PayReconstrucdeadLaugh'n'A 1/2Marlboro ManRim Of HellGirl NationPoint Of ViewHelpyourselfishI Won't Cut My Hair (Live)Riding With Sue (Live)It's After Dark (Live)Counting The Cattle (""Hidden"" track)"
5,Outstanding performance,"this is the most dynamic recording of anything I've ever heard. in the March you have to listen very closely to the timpani, but don't get to close cus' when the brass comes in you can tell they've been waiting. Muti unleashes the lion waiting behind the rest of the Orchestra waiting 36 minutes to play their part. From then on it's nothing like you've heard.another thing I've noticed is that there are a lot of soft areas with instruments playing in octaves and they're perfectly in tune with each other. all the solo's and Pianissimo sections are well played.to call this recording ""flat"" you would have had to not listened to it at all... or be completely deaf one.give this recording a try, you will enjoy it. it may or may not be the best out there, but with 16 four and five star reviews and one idiot how could you go wrong???"
5,Good Old Fashion Fun,"This movie is pretty good, I bought this one with another movie on the same disc. But this one I thought was entertaining,it kept me interested the entire time. It doesn't break any new ground with complicated twists and turns but I would recommend this one to anyone interested in some good old black and white movies."
3,Somebody Certaainly Cursed This Movie,I like this type of movie. If you don't then I advise you to avoid it. It's cheap and not very good.
4,As advertised.,"Seems to be working just fine, and it's certainly a lot cheaper than the other brands."
5,Absolutely great!,"I purchased this battery several month ago because I use my old Dell PDA every day and was a pain to keep recharging the small (OEM) ones. Don't hesitate. This battery works great. The only problem you may have is trying to get the PDA into some cases. My case allows it, as it is softer leather and stretches to accomodate the PDA with the larger battery. Another satisfied customer!"
1,This One Time at Band Camp....,All this is are vague one sentence tips followed by a whole page hunting story that is him trying to relive his glory days.Learned more in a 20 min Internet search then in this whole book.
5,Very good book,"I enjoyed this book immensly. I used some of his tactics this season and it was ""succesful."" I saw more deer this year than in any other year using the tactics from the book. However, I blew my chance which is no fault of the authors.You will enjoy the book and find the tactics useful.Good Hunting!"
4,Schuh does well,"I found this book very useful. The book is targeted toward bowhunting but the techniques are useful for any other hunting technology you'd care to apply to deer hunting. It does not try to cover all aspects of deer hunting (tracking, weapon choice and ballistics) what it covers is a technique for locating, spotting, stalking, and close approaching big bucks in wide open country. I found the style to be sort of down home but not in an irritating way. And his style does not get in the way of conveying the vital information in this book."
5,El Gato con Botas,"I really enjoyed reading this book to my child. I read him the Spanish version first (they are placed side by side) and the English version second. That saved me a lot of time and effort because I didn't have to translate after reading, which takes a lot of mental effort and is often inaccurate...My child also enjoyed the story. Highly recomend it."
2,"Should have had a yellow jacket, and read ""for dumbies"".","This book was very weak in content. It provides few noteworthy pointers. It is basically a common sense walk-through, of how to view an auction business. If you aren't a complete idiot, you probably have no use for this book."
2,In need of an update,"Wow. When I bought this book, I wish I'd taken note of the fact that all the positive reviews were from 2000 and 2001. The table of contents looked like it had everything I wanted to know about, but when I got the book and started to read it, I realized that it was WAY out of date. Most of the coverage of eBay, at least, refers to features that are either no longer available or that have changed radically. It also gives you tips on things like the checkout process that eBay now does for you.There are still some useful tips in here--after all, advice on how to use keywords in your listings and how to pack for shipping never gets out of date--but I'd highly recommend getting a more recent book like O'Reilly's ""eBay Hacks, Second Edition"". I found that one a LOT more useful and relevant."
5,Invaluable Information for ANY Parent!,"As the Practice Administrator for a group of pediatricians, this book is highly recommended to many of our patient's parents whose children are experiencing social skills issues. As one reads the extraordinarily well-conceived anecdotes describing specific problems/circumstances/behaviors, parents have told us that it is validating to them to have someone describe a situation that appears ""just like my child"" and wonderful to have a ""tools book"" that enables the parent(s) to proactively work with their child to overcome their child's social ""obstacles"" with the end result being an increase in self-esteem. The format of the book is very easy to understand and truly illustrates the concept of ""building blocks"" providing both parent and child with an effective and proactive guide to implementing a program that will assisst a parent in increasing their child's people skills."
3,Not a bad book but not the best,"Not as good as ""How To Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk"""
5,A book with amazing depth.,"Travels with Annie is very special in that it is a diary of a special person, during a special set of circumstances. It is not only well written, but an honest account of her travels and travails"
5,Aunt Annie,"LOVED the book. Not only because it's written by my Aunt Ann, but because she is an amazing woman. She has done things in her life that most of us would only dream of. So if she's reading this at any point, LOTS OF LOVE!!!"
5,Blend of Feminine and Masculine Energy in one Woman,I could not put this book down until completed. Ann writes with an interesting style which captured my imagination as she adventured through different countries and also through her treatments of cancer. Ann is a courageous being and shares with us the joy of Life. Her training as a therapist and her spiritual life have given her gifts which have carried her through her difficulties with a spirit which does not accept defeat. Just loved the book.
4,Great But......,"I bought this TV in August 07 after about 3 months of research, got it at a really good price after price match, but 3 months afterward, i was watching a show and all the sudden i saw smoke coming off the ""vent-hole"" behind TV, and the picture went away and TV was just flickering, luckelu when i bought the TV i had a service plan added to it, but it will take about a week and a half for a tech to come to my house for repair, i am very much hoping to just get a replacement and be done with it but we will see......TV is great i do believe i got a lemon unit,A good advice is to get a surge protector to use with the TV, for those who wonder i was using a surge protector at the time of TV going down.Overall a great TV especially watching Blu-ray and playing PS3 games on it."
1,LG Is A Rip Off -- Product Stops Working After 45 Days!,"Purchased an LG TV on strength of recommendation from friend. TV worked fine for 44 days. On 45th day, picture disappeared and then came back only intermittently. LG takes position that its only obligation under warranty at this point is to schedule service for several weeks out. Answer should have been ""Sorry, we will of course replace it."" So, if you're looking for a TV for 44 days and don't mind spending a thousand dollars, this is for you. Otherwise, I would try a different brand."
1,2 months and not working already,"I bought that TV, less then two month later the TV is not working, I am looking at a black screen. The customer service for LG is very poor, and now I have to wait a month before the received the piece of equipment to fix the problem... Never again I will buy LG. Next time I will go with Panasonic."
4,3500 watt Generator,Recieved the generator the same day a storm knock out our power. The generator was very easy to get setup and get running. excellent generator for the money.
5,Cleans And Doesn't Stink,"Have you ever noticed most pet shampoos leave your dog smelling like you smeared urinal cakes all over it? Well, this one doesn't. For that, it gets five stars. I have no idea if it gets all the dirt out or is tear-free (can dogs cry?). It's probably not manufactured from sustainable animal lard and doesn't biodegrade easily. But dammit, the dog doesn't smell like a public restroom and for that I am thankful."
4,My wife loves it,"It smells good, doesn't seem to bother the dog and didn't cause any reactions. More importantly my wife thinks the bottle is cute."
1,causes itching,"my baby lab starts itching all over when I used this. Would not recommend this product. if you must buy it, first test on a leg or something for irritation."
3,Smells Bad,"I was very happy with the performance of the product. The scent lasts longer than the expensive colognes I was using. I was not fond of the smell though. The Baby Powder fragrance smelled like nasty perfume. My wife liked the smell so I decided I would live with it; however, my children became sick to the stomach and complained that he smelled like ""old people.""So I threw it away and I am going to try the ""Rain Forest"" scent. The reviews for that scent have been very good."
3,"Did not love the smell, but cleaned Milo up nicely","My daughter was really excited when I ordered this for her puppy, since it got rave reviews from most people. We imagined the scent to be similar to a soft baby powder-type smell. But we didn't really care for it at all--it has a slight chemical odor to it. We were hoping for a fresher more natural scent. It did a fine job of washing the puppy's hair, but every time we held him we did not like how he smelled. We'll finish the bottle, but we will keep looking for a better shampoo."
5,LOVE It!,"I have a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. She gets dirty and tangled every so often. I've tried every spray, shampoo and conditioner on the market. Nothing works as well or smells as wonderful as this. I HATE perfumey smelling dog soaps/sprays. This is a fresh, clean, baby powder scent. The grooming spray when used after the shampoo makes brushing so much easier. I think those who think the smell is too strong either didn't rinse their dog well or have a super sensitive nose. The scent is wonderful and the products second to none. Highly recommended."
3,Not to bad - but could have been better.,"I had heard that this was a really good book for COBOL programmers who were now learning Java. It didn't really tie the two together very well. The author obviously has not keep up with the innovation in COBOL over the last few years. COBOL for MVS has FUNCTIONs that would have made better examples in some places. After completing this book I felt that it didn't really tell may much more that the other intro to Java books I had read. And the last chapters really lost me. It jumped from entry level stuff to chapters that seemed to be taken from some technical presentation. To me the next step should have been how Java does external data I/O. After I completed this book, I found that the book that I really wanted was ""Java for the COBOL Programmer (Advances in Object Technology""."
3,Shooting Gallery,"Not exactly a thinking man's game, there is very little plot and each area has pretty much the same feel - get sealed in an area until you kill all the monsters there, then you're able to move on. It feels a lot like Serious Sam in that regard - there is a nominal plot but the goal of the game feels like it is pretty much to point your crosshair at monsters and click the mouse button. I really like FPS games and have played through most of 'em but didn't feel compelled to finish this one - it was just missing the ""fun"" factor. Probably better for younger gamers interested in a ""fast twitch"" experience."
4,Sleeper hit,"Where did this come from? I saw a cheap $10 version that only has 12 levels and thought it might be worth the fun in killing the devil's minions. Truly this game has amazing graphics, killer sound, and isn't your everyday shooter. There are puzzles to solve and special ways to kill enemies. You can't just shoot them in the head a million times; you have to figure out the secret to getting rid of them. This game, while giving you a feeling of the original DOOM, is truly in a category of its own. And if you're going to buy it, get the Gold Edition because it comes with the expansion. Then, after you download the 3 updates, you'll actually have the BLACK edition. Whichever way is cheapest, if you like FPS games, get this one!"
1,Missing CD,"I received the game with 6 CDs but, only that it arrived with 2 copies of CD2. Missing CD 3. I am stuck and cannot complete the installation."
3,Cringeworthy-like old cable movie,"This move wasn't even all that funny. Felt like it was intended to be made with regular people, perhaps reality show-esque. Maybe it's better if you watch it wasted."
5,Impressive!,One can see the beginnings a great occultist in this early work of Waite as he delves wholeheartedly into his mostly alchemical subject matter.
5,Just as I remembered it!,What a pleasure to listen to and remember the: Music to listen to Barney Kessel by. I had the vinyl of same when a very young man and the magic of reliving the Barney Kessel CD made and continues to make my day. Top marks to Amazon.com for enabling people like me to remember and enjoy the music of our youth.
2,Hope you're not the visual type,"If you are brand new to options and you are not the visual type (there isn't a single graph in this book) and you like cute little cartoons, then this book is for you.Most of this book focuses on various naked strategies which work great in certain markets, but can be instant death in others. Also, there is very limited information on resources to use in your research.From a literary point, the flow of the book is quite good, so I could see someone reading it from cover-to-cover. If you are a self-help person, you'll love this book, but you will still have the same issue that after you finish it, you may feel better, but you aren't any smarter.Go do some searches on the web for info. Optionetics.com, optionvue.com, and 21stCenturyOptionsEducation.com are all good places to start. _The Stock Market Course_ by Fontanills and Gentile (Optionetics) is great and for general trading info and an attitude adjustment, check out _Trading for a Living_ by Elder.Happy Trading!"
2,Too simple and selling newsletter,"This book is too simple and the goal is selling you the subscription service.I subscribed to the newsletter service and lose money on every trades, the strategies did not work."
3,Good but dated book,"Good solid information about options trading. It is indeed 'Complete'. I am annoyed, however, that this 'revised and updated' edition persists in using antiquated fractional notation in the charts and text. Thus throughout the book you see prices listed as 4-7/8 or 10-1/4. Converting this book to decimals would have forced Mr. Trester to use modern examples, instead of those from the 1970's and that would have also benefited this fine work. The option tables in the back of the book at least are in decimal form and should prove quite useful."
2,book a bit off,this book more about accepting options from an employer than buying and selling in the option market. rather misleading title
3,Where was MARTIN LAWRENCE????,"I'm getting ready to order this DVD, but in the video, I don;t see Martin Lawrence. Now, this is a problem for me, because you have Kat Williams on here, but no Martin? Martin was one of the best comedians as well and he did things in comedy/sitcoms that NO ONE ELSE did! Ugghh!! I will be HIGHLY disappointed if he isn't in it!"
1,Why We Laugh,I do not like this DVD at all...Not at ALL what I expected and hope that Amazon will take this back and give me a credit for something that I will enjoy! My first BIG HUGE disappointment from Amazon...we will see about the return policy!
5,Why We laugh,"An imformative and inspiring documentary, which puts the importance of comedy in perspective. Understanding the role that it has played in the shaping and reflection of a culture. Also it was great to see the thoughts and opinions of many outstanding leading comics. As one in the Arts, it encouraged me to continue to strive for excellence and have something to say.Why We Laugh"
5,informative,had some good comice doing commentary and very interesting on the beginnings of some of the best comics to have graced a stage
4,a brief against suburban sprawl,"If you want a fairly definitive guide to all the disadvantages of suburban sprawl, read this book. I also recommend it as a source guide, because it cites a lot of sources on both sides of the issue.It does have some imperfections: it is very focused on environmental issues, so I wouldn't pretend that it is the definitive guide on other sprawl related problems (e.g. social justice issues), though it does address such issues to some extent. Also, I think it is a bit more biased towards ""big government"" solutions to sprawl than I would be if I were writing a book on the subject. But by and large, I recommend it."
4,i like it,"i went to buy a regular paper filter for my 02 jeep grand Cherokee overland at the parts store, they wanted $25 i was like why would i do that when i can put another 25 to that and have a lifetime filter?so thats what i did. thats why i bought this, and of course i hoped for better mpg and power. i cant tell any more power. i havent been able to test mpg yet as ive been towing a trailer. my first tank is almost up without a trailer to get the #s and ill post them.bottom line i like it, i got it to have a lifetime filter regardless if i got better power or mpg. maybe when i get a catback on my jeep ill see the gains"
3,Overview of story,"When Richard Arbyght becomes a cooper in a Chicago meat-packing plant, he is made painfully aware of the poor wages, irregular pay, long hours, and deplorable working conditions of the common laborer, and of the exorbitant prices and dishonest practices of the company store. Aroused to action, he organizes his fellow workers and leads them in a strike against the company. His spirits buoyed by success, Richard begins his own company based on his theories of profit sharing, after the strike is settled. Written to expose the inhumane practices of the factory owner and to extol the advantages of profit sharing, The Other Side consists of almost equal parts social commentary, economic theory, and fictional human interest."
1,Broken,When I recived the unit it was covered in oil like substance. I could tell the box had been opened and re-shut. To me it seems like they where trying to sell an item that had been already returned. I am returning it for the same one. If this one doesn't work I am going to get a refund for sure. They also need to package the product better. It was a joke how they had this 100lb ac packed.
3,Cools great but unit arived damaged,The unit cools 2 small upstairs bedrooms well. It is quieter that the wall sleeve units in my apartment. Unfortunately the unit arrived with a cracked bottom that I did not discover until the carpet was completely soaked.
1,Don't waste your time,"The only reason I gave this one star is that there isn't an option for zero (0) stars.I bought two of these and neither one worked out of the box. Amazon did give me a refund quickly, but I was very disappointed that the product sounded so good and qas so bad.Do not buy."
3,New edition?,"Great book with lots of photos, but not all that revised or up to date if you have the 2002 third edition. New photos of some that were needed, but still missing some of the newer boats (eg Sultana). Given the rate of change within the tall ship community it's a noble effort and well worth the price."
4,"Great, but wait for the DVDs","These are two great episodes from season three and set up what proves to be an explosive story arc showcasing Faith - who is what Buffy could have been without the support of friends and family.However, DON'T buy it. Season two DVDs are going to be released in the US come June 2002 and the wait will be well worth it. See the episodes in the context of the entire season. Sure, you'll know what's going on if you buy this video, but the previous episodes help show just how Faith came to have such a chip on her shoulder when it came to Buffy and the Scoobs."
4,Good,"Good, but not great Mercer Mayer. Story and artwork wonderful as usual, but suffers compared to some other works by the author."
1,Myth perpetuating,"Biased toward the myth of the spoiled brat who *really"" didn't deserve to accomplish what he did. Good for a giggle."
5,This book changed my life!,"Not only is this a fabulous book, but Joe Cleemann and Marie Estrada are fabulous authors and wonderful human beings. It is rare to find a book of this quality that can have such a impact on one's life. I am a better person now that I have read it. ... It should be required reading for anyone planning a career in public service."
5,Meaningless. Fabulous!,"In the eternal scheme of things, nothing really matters... And you can read about all that nothingness in glowing, superbly organized detail in this book.The Our Gang Kids once studied for a test by reading Captain Billy's Whiz Bang.You, however, as a modern marvel of intelligence and sophistication, have Uncle John.Buy this book. (Heck, buy ALL his books.) If there's a real Uncle John, I'm sure he'll be quite grateful. Captain Billy, on the other hand, is probably already dead and doesn't care what you buy.I hate to appear cold and unfeeling, but that's the essence of the thing. And, if there really is an Uncle John, he will know if you click off this page and buy some lousy movie, instead.Yep, all in all, I'd say you'd better buy this book.So... It's agreed? You'll buy it?We're billing your account right now.Thank you, on behalf of Uncle John."
5,"Such a lovely, lovely story.","I can't recommend it enough. I found it the first time in a library tag sale, of all places, but since I've bought it from every child I know. It's so touching and it literally makes this full-fledged adult tear up. Happily, my daughter really loves it, too."
5,Nice Day With Buddy Collette,"This is excellent jazz. It swings without squeaking and honking. Buddy Collette can swing with the best of them and sound good at the same time. His clarinet work is excellent. Leroy Vinnegar and Shelly Manne along with John Goodman and Bill Dolney hold it all together. Pianists Don Friedman, Dick Shreve and Calvin Jackson all contribute to this delightful album. The listener can't help but recognize some Brubeck/Desmond interplay along with an intro on one take that sure is pure Erroll Garner. If you like West Coast sounds you will love this album."
3,sometimes i fall asleep,"this cd is a good recording. with great songs like ""futures"", ""just tonight..."", and ""pain"" this album wasnt too shaby. but the rest of the tracks are slow slow slow. sometimes slow enough to put you right to sleep. this cd is still good, but could have used a boost of energy."
2,my initial reaction,"What in the world happened to my favorite band of yesteryear? I can still pop in Clarity and hear and feel the lushness of that record. It is not old to me at all even today. Futures however is flat. That is the best word I can use to describe it. It feels completely emotionless to me. Clarity had emotion pouring out of it from every corner, but this...is flat. The production is flat. The music is flat. They lyrics are way flat. The best song to me so far is Kill. I honestly pray that this album grows on me, but there is little depth there. I almost even wish I was listening to Bleed American. I have continued hopes for this...and I hope they come true. At least I will always have Clarity. I encourage all of you to buy that record...and feel what Jimmy Eat World will always be to me. At least I have that."
5,Outstanding Album,"Futures is an excellent album and a great choice to purchase. Isn't that what all great albums should be?The entire CD is on point, and the bonus disc is pretty cool. Some demos showed that the songs had to be refined and polished, others were virtually complete and the band had them down pat.But what's most important is the main disc, and it's stellar. It has realistic and inspiring lyrics, great song sequencing, and a great mix of slower and faster songs. The band can play resonant opuses, but they can also turn their guitars way down and thrash.Every song is done well, and most are a breath of exhiliration. Try waking up to the title track, it's great! 5/5, one of the upper-tier albums of the 2000s."
5,Best J.E.W. CD Yet!!,This CD is by far the best CD Jimmy Eat World has dropped. You can listen to this CD over and over and never get bored of have to keep skipping the same tracks because every single one of them is amazing. This is possibly the best CD out today
3,It's growing ...,"Having heard only one song on this Jimmy Eat World CD, I decided to buy it. Not really a fan of the band, I thought I'd give it a shot. Initially, I thought it was really bad. Not one song except ""Pain"" did anything for me. Really no distinct original sound that separates good bands from the rest. However, over the past few weeks, I figure I at least get use out of the 14 bucks I paid. And quite honestly, it's grown on me. Will I listen to this CD a year from now, probably not. Will I listen to it until my next CD purchase, probably. In my opinion, a sign of a good CD is its staying power, and this one has none.For that, I give it a 3 out of 5."
2,totally misses the mark,"This album is a pretty big dissapointment. It's OK, but I can't say more than that. They sound less like themselves and more like everyone else. They seem to have lost their edge. They cannot be considered EMO anymore, they are just radio pop. On one track, they sound like they are trying to be Matchbox 20 or something and that is not a good thing. The once semi standout band is no more. They just don't have it anymore."
2,Cant polish a turd.,"All in all this album is such a let down when compared to JEW's back catalogue.All the glossy production on this album cannot disguise how weak the songs are. It sounds like a band disinterested in what they are doing and it seems like Jim Adkins spent 5 minutes on the lyrics. I mean, some of the lyrics would even make Blink 182 balk.Dont get me wrong, I am a huge Jimmy fan but this record is the work of a band just looking for one last pay day. I hate to say it but I think we have heard the last of Jimmy Eat World. I very much doubt they will release another album. By the sounds of ""Futures"", their heart isnt in it and their mind was on futures elsewhere.I really hop I am wrong."
1,No futures here,Jimmy Eat World really took a big step backwards with this album. Their last 2 albums hardly had a bad song on them so what happened? Uninspired song writing and over production seems to be the underlying theme on Futures. I could tell something was wrong after the first crunching riff than opens the horrible title track. Add to that the flat vocals and cheesy lyrics and there's not much here that distiguishes jimmy eat world from all the other emo bands flooding the airwaves.
1,5 years for uninspired music? Come on!!!!,"Don't all hate me at once but this album is pure trash. All the songs sound the same, all the lyrics are lame, and it makes me wonder why it took them 5 years to put together something that sounds like it was made over night and without much thought. After the great Bleed American album (which was poppy but catchy) I had very high hopes for this album. I have listened to it several times (with the hopes that it will grow on me) but get really annoyed with it. Sorry guys, this one is a bomb - and not a good bomb at that."
4,What the heck is going on???,"Okay, before I review the Cd, i gotta get something off my chest. To the reviewer below me, Kevin whiteman, who are you to diss Mae? They're a totally cool band (just like Jimmy Eat World) finally making a name for themselves. What kind of jackass disses a good band just to get back at some loser reviewer. And by the way dipsh*t, tooth and Nail is NOT all over Mtv, not yet anyway, and just because they have a couple videos and ads on MTV2, that gives you the right to diss the whole label? Don't even diss Mtv in the first place loser, because thats where Jimmy Eat World got their big break. If you were any kind of true emo fan, you wouldn't go personally attacking someone for having different musical tastes, even if that person makes little or no sense...As for the C.D, i thought it was good, although I wont have a totally accurate opinion until I let it grow on me."
4,Peak stand,This is a good solution for a professional needing a light compact stand with a solid back for gigs. The only reason I gave 4 stars is the bulkiness of the stand. I've been using the Peterson stand which folds into a small box shape. The Peak is sturdier.
5,It's sturdy and easy to carry around!,"This is an absolutely wonderful music stand. It's sturdy but completely portable since it can be folded into a storage bag (about 35in x 7 in x 7in). If you like portable and sturdy music stands, this is definitely the one for you."
4,Solid and portable,This is the stand I have been waiting for. The first concert I played at after receiving the stand was outside with 20 - 30 mph wind gusts. My entire folder was blown off the stand but the stand itself never budged. It is a snap to set up and take down and is quite light for its size. My only complaint is that it doesn't fold up as small as I would like but the included carry bag makes it easy to transport.
2,Flawed,"This product was highly recommended to me by several professional musicians. I cannot recommend it to anyone. I considered the top of the stand to be somewhat delicate when I received mine, so I used care when I unfolded it. As I did, plastic pieces began to break off at the hinges. Fortunately, I was able to exchange the first stand for a replacement. However, I believe the design is flawed, as I must carefully ""coax"" it each time I unfold the top and tiny pieces continue to break off now and then. Because the price is what I could afford and I needed a portable stand that would hold a large music book, I continue to use it. However, I'm never confident when I go to open it up for use that it will function as intended. The base is rather sturdy once assembled and it works well for my daughter's ""Arbans"" trumpet method book at home, but not so well on the road with my string quartet."
4,Not perfect but way better than anything else for the price,"The Peak Portable Stand is superior to just about any other stand at the price. It seems to be reasonably sturdy, much lighter than the steel desk style stands, and much steadier than the folding wire/metal strip stands. Easy to set up. I bought it because it appeared steady and sturdy enough to hold a tablet computer, and it is great for that. On the down side, it might not hold up to heavy professional use, and is a bit bulky when disassembled, but comes with a nice bag/case that make if pretty easy to carry. I'd recommend it."
2,"This is a nice stand, but there is one problem.","We have used this stand for the last few years at church. We have to set up and break down everything each week and within one year each one of the 5 stands we bought had broke in one way or another. If you are very careful with your things you may not have this problem, but we had to load ours in a trailer every week.. they didn't last."
5,Traveling musician perfect,"Other than being a little cheaply built it works great. I like the fold up into a small package idea. Room for a stand in the vehicle can be a problem for most of these types of stands. I can put this over the shoulder, carry my guitar and gigbag in one trip."
4,excellent,"I have an autistic spectrum disorder, and many autistics have digestive issues and lack disgestive enzymes. I was having a lot of indigestion at the end of each day, so I tried this. Now my digestion is much, much better. I take one at the start of each meal. If I have an extra large meal, I take 2."
5,Kids can take them.,"This is not strong one that I wanted to use, but I bought it for my kids.The capsules are small enough for our kids (5yrs and 9yrs) to swallow without problem."
1,Digestive enzymes? Really!!????,"I've been using digestive enzymes for a while. And it really helps a lot. I purchased digestive enzymes from stores and also from Amazon before (different seller). It was always effective and never had problems before until this last time. This time it is almost like I did not take digestive enzymes. I take the enzymes 10 minutes before every meal, and I feel comfortable after my meal, no gas, and no bloating. Not this time. I continued to take it before my meals, but it feels like I have not taken anything. I've discomfort, gas and bloating. BE AWARE of this company/seller. I don't know what they are selling but it's NOT DIGESTIVE ENZYMES!!!!!!!!!!!!! Shame on you for being so corrupt, and playing with people's health issues. Again DO NOT BUY from this company/seller!!!!!!!!"
3,No noticeable difference.......,I have not observed a noticeable difference in digestion since using this product. Can't tell if it really helps or not. Maybe I didn't have digestion problems in the first place.
1,Does not work! (I am writing a review based on two CD-ROMS),"First of, I purchased this game being my all-time favorite. The problem with this CD-ROM is that is does NOT work most of the time - I get an error message almost always. As a matter of fact, I asked the distributor to send a second copy, as I received the same error message in the first CD-ROM I received.I must stress that both, my PC and notebook, meet minimum requirements for this game. Out of about 10 times I tried to use the game, it only worked once. This is completely unacceptable! Suffice it to say, I'd not recommend this product even at its bargain price."
2,More an novel than reference book,The book is to my understanding intended for someone who knows and enjoys the works of Sarah McCartney. The book has an interesting topic but at some point it loses it focus and starts shifting to secondary topics like the yuppie culture in the 80's. In the end I was left with bit confusion what I actually got out of the book. Maybe a re-read one day helps me to like this book more than I did on first read.
3,Just ok,"I purchased a set of 2 of these chairs to add to an existing dinette set. From the description and picture I expected them to be a bit more substantial than they actually are. They seem sturdy, but just a tad too small and nothing really special about them. Also, one of the seat pieces wouldn't fit - it was not cut correctly and wouldn't fit. So I had to use a saw to cut off a bit of the part tha tucks between the back frame. You can't see it or tell, as it's hidden, but it was a pain to have to do. I think I'll stick to purchasing furniture in person from now on."
4,Fun read,"I thoroughly enjoyed Wendy Markham's newest book Slightly Settled. Our main character is still looking for love in all the wrong places, including her office Christmas party.Markham has a wonderful way with her words and makes you really like her characters.While the plot was somewhat predictable, there were some seriously funny moments and some not so funny ones.Great, fun read."
2,Low expectations will be rewarded,"Do some Americans lack an inner life? I would have fought you to the death on that one until I read 'Slightly Settled.' Tracey seems to think about little but losing weight, picking her dress for the party and snagging a boyfriend. Seeing her boss in his underwear in the hallway? We should all have such earthshaking crises. The book also had several typos and editing errors that reinforced the impression it was a write-to-order rush job. The dialogue is snappy, however, and Tracey gets a few good lines. With this kind of character, I guess it's a relief that no ""big issues"" were introduced. For fun, light reading, you can do a lot better, but at least no one gets an eating disorder or dies of AIDS."
3,Better off single,"We greet Tracey Spadolini shortly where we left off....broken up with Will, still friends with Buckley, Raphael, and Kate, but now she's back at Blaire Barnett as a secretary. She's got a new boss and life seems good. A sequence of events starting with the Office Christmas party leads Tracey to find a new man named Jack. Is he"
4,Slightly Settled,Very funny you will love the main character. One of those you won't be able to put down until done.
5,Perfect fit!,"This product fits perfectly in our 2000 Silverado extended cab! It has plenty of storage spaces that allow us to organize our tie downs, etc. while still giving us the ability to use our back seat without any issues. Perfect!"
1,What a joke !!!,"Lists of numbers (page 5 to page 211) and supposedly all the participant has to do is a) choose the lottery game you wish to play, b) select a GUARANTEED prize level combination set, and c) play all the combinations listed (i.e., fill in the slots on the lottery tickets and make your purchase at a lottery retailer). Imagine filling in 500 lottery tickets, standing in line as the clerk enters each ticket, AND spending $500 on those tickets BUT having ONE winning ticket for THREE DOLLARS !! **$3**!! Hey, there's your GUARANTEED win!!!"
4,Good but Complex,"A scholarly and very insightful look at the socail context of prophecy in the Ancient Near East. The book develops categories and common aspects of the prophets in the Hebrew Scripture. However, the information is not very approachable nor is it a good beginning resource. The text is complex and makes heavy use of Hebrew and other terminology not in the venacular of most amateur students of the Bible vocabulary."
5,ROFLMAO,"If you are a *serious* student of Norse mytholgoy, you probably need to lighten up. Jane Sibley provides a wonderous retelling of old tales with plenty of humor, social satire, and ribaldry. This is a ""must have"" for the well-rounded Pagan bookshelf."
5,"A Must Read If You Want To Know About ""The Other Side"" or Heaven, or Whatever You Call It. . .","Absolutely the best book that I have ever read about ""Life After Death"". I have never given a 5 star rating before. This one is worth it. Buy this Book Today!! I could not put it down. It is a book of great detail about what we can expect our spirit life to be when we pass on. I could not put the book down. It will certainly give you peace of mind about the next world, where our souls will go after our bodies have died in this world. For all our sake, I certainly hope this is how our lives will be in the spirit world. . . through the veil, so to speak. Very very comforting! I will try to seek other books by this author.FL Designer"
5,A Must Read,"...for anyone seeking what resonates as 'truth' regarding what to expect in the afterlife. Reverence comes from within and cannot be found externally. What we deem as ""Heaven"" is vastly different from reality as noted here by an earthly Monsignor. If we will break free of the illusion of religion and adopt an internal Spirituality, where we judge ourselves... souls in the afterlife will have a lot less 'work' to perform when we initially arrive there upon our earthly death."
5,Enemies/Earshot are the 2 best episodes.,"Enemies (Season 3): This is the first real Faith/Buffy enemy acknowledgement.This episode is packed with love, betrayel, hate, and a surprise twist at the end!Earshot (Season 3): This is where Buffy gains the ability to read minds. She discovers interesting secrets and a plot for mass murder.One of the funniest episodes ever!This set is a must own!"
3,Disappointed in the physical aspect of the book,I was very disappointed in the physical aspect of this book. It is small. Just over half the size of a normal paperback book. The type is also smaller than normal making it difficult to read. I bought this as a xmas gift for my 86 year old mother who loves inspirational stories. I'm now not sure she'll be able to enjoy it. (I have no opinion on the contents as I just received it and haven't really looked at the stories.)
5,Simpson Related Things To Do,"This book basically is for finding something for elementary aged children to do. The games are desribed in ways relating to the show, but many are just actually Simpson related twists of old games. This book faetures many card games, scientific tricks, optical illusions, and many other things that can be done inside the house. This book also features some great puzzles, and a area with children related recipes. Buy this book to keep your children entertained, I'm sure they'll find much of the book useful."
2,Very hard to work with,I was very excited to try this but it's a very pretentious product. If it dryes on your car before you get to buff it will leave stains. Of course you can take them out with a lot of elbow grease but it's very frustrating. I did a couple of cars and it took me twice as long than it would with other similar products. I don't recomend it. Use turtle wax brand instead . It'll make your life a whole lot easier.
5,Great and tough blowing,"Eddie Davis is really tough and hard-driving on this magnificent album and the contrast between his playing and the more subtle and ellegant playing of the organist Shirley Scott and the flute player Jerome Richardson is musically quite intriguing.George Duvivier on bass also has a great contribution, but listen how the things start cookin' when Richardson takes on his tenor sax and battles with the leader (as a contrast to the rest of the album where he ellegantly complements him)..."
5,"Great, fun bank!",I got this for my adult Vikings-fan son. He was almost overwhelmed in laughter. He loves it!
4,Osprey Air Combat Book - North American F-100 Super Sabre,"Another excellent aviation book from Osprey Air Combat and a must for any fan of the F-100 Super Sabre.Book is out of print and rare. My copy was used, in very good condition,and at an excellent price. Thank you, Amazon."
1,Horrible Product,"I followed the directions to a ""T"". After only one minute connected to my PC the Talismoon Minispy SATA Xbox 360 hard Drive Data Transfer Adapter Kit caught on FIRE. It burned the connector box and fried the adapter port on my 360 HDD Shell. I didn't even have the chance to see if I could read any of the files from my 360 HDD. Currently unable to play 360. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Minispy SATA transfer kit,It doesn't work at all. It's a waste of time and MONEY!!! Don't buy it. Instructions aren't clear and it almost burned my USB port!!!
1,Why Not To Buy It,"when i bought Talismoon ""Minispy SATA"" Xbox 360 Hard Drive Data Transfer Adapter Kit i pluged it into the pc hopping it will work i waited 1 min the pc recognized it and then ''Pop'' the conecter got damaged !!!!!!!!!!!!!!I WOULD RATE THIS 1/10 THIS IS THE Worst item i bought."
2,Fedora Core 2 DVD does not boot,OK. I am a neophite and what better book than this one. Or so it would seem until I tried to install the included DVD which contains Fedora Core 2 Linux. Insert the DVD and reboot then the get the intro screen asking if you want a graphical or textual install. I selected graphical and it started then rebooted the PC. I tried this several times. The PC I am using is based on a VIA EPIA Eden CPU motherboard and Fedora Core 1 installs just fine.
3,Puma soccer player,"The shoe is an excellent fit and is obviously of high quality. However the leather is not as soft as I expected. I have a pair of Puma King Exec FG and leather is very soft and pliable. This is the reason that I purchased the Puma King Exec TT. The feel of the leather on the Puma King Exec TT is a disappointment, it is not as soft as expected. Hence three (3) stars instead of five (5)"
1,This book is missing a lot of pages.,I purchased this book and I found out that the book is missing a lot of pages and some of the pages were duplicated. I am hoping the publisher will found out and recall this print.
5,Favor for friends,"I bought this for friends who live over in England. They had bought the 2001 edition while living here in the U.S. They swore by the 2001 edition and used it constantly. They called to report it was falling apart, and they could not find a replacement in England. I found the 2006 version on Amazon.com; bought it; and had it shipped directly to them in England. It was delivered within 10 days. They called to report it had arrived and were very pleased."
4,"Good starter book, but appears to have been written quickly","As a starter book I would recommend it, but I think that a little more explanation would be useful. A disk with the books examples would have been nice so that the reader could see where his syntax has gone wrong (as mine did frequently). I appreciate that this would increase cost. This should not have been a problem as examples are supposed to be on the web site. It would have been useful if the book had given the URL. The book appears to have been written quickly, indeed the copyright notice is dated 1998 and I bought the book in November 1997 (perhaps we could photocopy & sell it before the New Year!!!) Overall the book does gives some useful tips to the beginner and would also be useful for those a little more advanced."
5,Enhanced with full color sequence photographs,"In World-Class Tennis Technique: Master Every Stroke, Paul Roetert and Jack Groppel have drawn from some of the world's top experts in biomechanics, tennis techniques, and coaching to provide the aspiring or practicing tennis player with a comprehensive guide covering every aspect of the game as it relates to technique. An in-depth analysis of each stoke is enhanced with full color sequence photographs. If you are an amateur player seeking a professional level of mastery, or an aspiring tournament contender, give a careful reading to Roetert and Groppel's World-Class Tennis Technique!"
2,"NOT the Richard Basehart version of ""Connecticut Yankee""","This isn't actually a review of the DVD's content as I didn't get past the title screen of ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"" before I discovered Digiview had entered the wrong cast on the cover. I was searching for Richard Basehart's 1970 portrayal of King Arthur and found Boris Karloff's 1952 Studio One version instead:[...]For all I know the Studio One production could be awesome, but it isn't what I was looking for so I will have to return the DVD. Just a warning to anyone else who was looking for the version advertised on the DVD."
3,Let's get something straight.,"I DO NOT LIKE Tina Yothers. Oh, I know what you're going to say, she's cute and nice and gives balance and sensibility to the unpredictable Keaton household. But I saw her at a Long John Silver's in Encino and she snubbed me. As if!"
5,Awesome!!,Very well-made - solid straps....you can collapse it when not in use WITHOUT unfastening it. It also fits wide bottles and even mini umbrellas.VERY useful if you need an extra space bit of space on your backpack.
5,Great addition to backpack,Great componet to backpack. Can be used for extra long lens or a water bottle. Easy to attach to several areas on backpack. Built sturdy but lite weight.
5,Praise for the Unlost,"In spite of the fact that Tillie Olsen's Yonnondio has been accused at several occasions of silencing or not fully developing the women's issues sketched on it, this work is (in my opinion) a great innovation on the part of Olsen. Yonnondio is not only the typical product of the Socialist literary tradition, wherein the expected Proletarian Realism is displayed and developed: Olsen's Feminist concerns were not completely silenced and no ""lament for the lost"" feminist issues can be raised and wielded against her. By includying her Feminist interests, Olsen was as strong as to differ from the Party's established rules improving in this way Proletarian Realism.Even though Feminist issues and worries such as the double opression of working-class women, sex-roles or the mother-daughter relationship are not finely-developed or solutions granted, this work provides the reader with clues and hints which will make him/her question many of his/her pre-established preconceptions."
5,A must see for Wabash Railroad fans.,"An excellent show tracing the history of the ""Wabash Railroad"". Many interviews with former ""Wabash employees"", ""Historians/Authors"", and members of the ""Wabash Railroad Historical Society"". Some rare film footage also included. Good action shots of the Wabash F7 #1189 locomotive at the Monticello Railway Museum. Very nice show!"
3,"One more for the ""Just OK"" pile","This cd is nothing more than just ok. It doesn't suck, but there are so many cd's out there that it just doesn't stand out. I was seriously disappointed. It starts off very interesting but after the second song it just goes bland,a couple of songs are actually pretty bad. I really wish I hadn't bought it."
1,Don't waste your money,"I have owned this vacuum cleaner for 3 months. Already the self-propel switch does not work properly. Most of the time I can't get it to switch from self-propel ""on"" to self-propel ""off"". Even worse than that problem is the fact that the vacuum won't turn off! I have to unplug it from the wall to turn it off. I have used this cleaner less than 20 times and think it is a hunk of junk. It cleans ok, but the other problems make it very frustrating to use. My previous Hoover lasted me 20 years with virtually no problems. I won't buy another Hoover product. The construction is cheap and even without the above-mentioned problems, I don't think it will last very long."
2,POWER RANGERS SPD,My 5 year old son loved this toy the first day he got it. I paid $29.99 and he never played with it since. He does loves all of his Power Rangers SPD action figures. He is even having a SPD 6th Birthday Party:)
2,Came with a dead battery,This is good product (I bought one before) but the 12v battery that came with this product was dead.I am not sure how much a new battery is but it is a headache and extra cost.
1,Not Homelink Compatible,"I have a Skylink garage door operator. It works great, but the remote is not Homelink compatible. So I called Skylink and asked if they had a remote unit that that is Homelink compatible. They assured me that the 318TR would work with Homelink. I ordered one from Amazon, followed the instructions very carefully, but no dice. Checked out Homelink videos on YouTube, I was doing the procedure correctly. Called Skylink, they told me to try again and sent the same instructions. So I did it several more times, even tried it with another Homelink equipped vehicle. It does not work. Very disappointed with Skylink support on this product. Wasted $25 on the 318TR."
3,Limited range,"Easy to install, but the product is very poor. The range is very limited. I cannot get it to work more than 2 feet away."
1,DOA,"The receiver was dead, no light, no nothing, when I received it. This is the second issue I have had with skylink. I am going to try another brand."
1,Pure Junk,"First unit was DOA. Amazon was quick on a turn around. Installed the 2nd and found signal from transmitter could not make it through the garage door. It's a steel one, still the Genie remote is a able to send a signal through my door. Frustrating experience as I wasted about 4 hours on this project. I think I'll just get another Genie (expensive) remote."
5,Awesome Remote -- cheaper than OEM,"We had an older model garage door opener and had lost on of the remotes. After researching aftermarket remotes and finding out the different frequencies that they work on, the cheapest was at least double the price of this unit. The Skylink was simple to install and setup. Just plug it in next to the garage door opener and run the wire to the ""door bell"" wires. In our case, we already had a wired outside keypad for this garage door, so we sired it directly to the keypad unit. That's it -- it just works. Great product.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GPZXZ6/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
5,Garage Door Remote...,"So far, so good. Everything's working great. Easy to install and even has better range than our original one. Shopped around and checked feedback before purchasing. I would definitely recommend this item. Great price too!"
5,Great product,I bought this and another receiver to fix my two 22year old garage door openers. I lost the remote to one and the other just did not receive a signal no matter what. The skylink units only took 5 minutes to install and they works great. I have it set so the left button on the remote works one door and the other button works my other door. The best part is I can open and close my doors from inside my house too.
3,good solution,"This product is an inexpensive solution to a nonfunctioning garage remote control. I had to send the first one back due to it not working, but Amazon made that easy, so that is why they didn't get 4 stars. The second one works fine. This replaces a 318TR I had been using for over 5 years- I was happy with it.I don't know if this is a secure remote opener, but is has around 1000 different codes so if a pro wants to crack it they will. Just change the factory setting for goodness sake. Your old remote is probably not any more sophisticated, if it is you aren't really considering this anyway.I like it."
5,Skylink works Great,"The receiver and remote are small well made items that performed exactly as advertised. They installed easily and the remote works better (read that as farther away) than the original did. Good stuff, economical. I will definitely use them again if the need arises."
4,Wroks Fine,"I used this set to replace a built in door opener receiver that failed due to interference from a local military base. It was simple to install and best of all, it works fine."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed. Product was defective does not work at all. I have purchased for e-bay for years and many different idems from over $2,000.00 to several dollars and had only one problem. I try Amazon and get cheated the very first time without any follow up from seller.The product was not functioning and would not program, totally useless and and waste of my time and money, Did the manufacture even test before shiping, I doubt it!! Nothing in the package as a number to call or toubleshoot.I have learned my lesson....... I quess"
2,Analog units leave a lot to be desired,Skylink 18TR is a digital version of the 318TR that performs much better...very long range and quick response. Skylink 318TR is slow to respond and has a very low range...DO NOT RECOMMEND.
3,How does one mess up a sticky piece of plastic?,"Okay, this thing does exactly what it is supposed to do, it protects the screen. Never mind that the plastic is not exactly fitted to the touch screen, leaving a gap on at least one side, let's let that go for a second, as it doesn't really leave enough room for any kind of stylus damage. I got these filters because the ones I got the last time went up in price and I didn't feel like paying 13 bucks for a piece of clear plastic. These filters, however, are way too cloudy for my liking and they don't wipe down that well, streaking instead of coming clean. If you're willing to put in the extra cash try getting one of the ClearTouch Screen Protector sets, either Anti-glare or Crystal types, both are good, easy to apply and come with a card to smooth the plastic during application and squeeze the bubbles out. Of course one could just use a credit card for this, but it's nice to have one included."
4,Good Stuff,I used it to protect my Cowon D2 (also uses a touch interface) instead of a DS. Works great though.
5,Wonderful,I don't know why Amazon thinks this is a game... These are very nice filters They don't mess with the color of the screen or it's sensitivity. They are easy to apply and remove. And the cleaning cloth is useful.
4,Nick Cannon Does (or Doesn't) Make a Statement,"Cannon wants to make it clear that he is not making a statement about choice/life but only telling his story. Despite this ""Can I Live,"" has become an anthem for the pro-life movement. The video stars Tatiana Ali as a pregnant woman who runs out of an abortion clinic. Nick Cannon's mother makes a cameo in the video which is based on a true story. It's a different look for Cannon who is known for pop/party music. I can't really tell if he is rapping or singing in the song, maybe he is rapping, I dunno. It's an okay song but I am really ready for Nick to get back to the party jams."
3,the Lyrics are on Point.Music is alright,"I really dig the sentments of this song.the music is alright,but it's the Lyrics&the way Nick Cannon is expressing&Blessed of His Mother's choice. the Video is on point as well.the Music was alright&I can take or leave Anthony Hamilton being the R&B Nate Dogg of the Hook Moment.but the lyrics hit home."
5,One Of The Norman Granz-Pablo Label Winners,"Recorded about one year before his relatively early death, ""Quietly There"" features Zoot Sims in his most complementary setting - a small group. Mike Wofford contributes some nice piano work here and Zoot shows how extra years of practice can hone a great talent to an even higher degree than that shown in his landmark quartet and quintet recordings of the 1950's. Don't be put off by the fact that Zoot was older here - his solos really shine while playing these Johnny Mandel charts. This is highly recommended for fans of cool jazz - and certainly should be included in your collection if you are a Zoot fan.If you're not familiar with Sims- he was known as the consummate swinger. No matter the complexity of the solo, Zoot would not lose the rhythm and very, very rarely played a wrong note or inappropriate phrase. He was truly among the giants of the jazz saxophone. I put him solidly in the top 5 of all-time great sax talents."
3,Good big-band compositions.,"Here is an exciting CD of jazz composition featuring a big band. But if you're buying it to hear Anouar Brahem, you will probably be disappointed. It's essentially big-band jazz, albeit modern and quite interesting. Leader Paolo Damiani plays cello, and even he is largely overpowered by eleven other musicians plus Anouar Brahem and Gianluigi Troversi."
2,Horrible! Just Horrible!,"I bought these because they were the only thing on the market I could find besides the one I currently had from Best Buy. Unfortunately, the one from Best Buy came attached to a gift card and was rainbow colored. Well, me being a heterosexual, I didn't feel comfortable sporting a rainbow phone grip even though this phone grip from Best Buy was just amazing. It was just the right thickness and stayed on the phone.This Gadget Grip is paper thin and has barely any adhesive on it. It started to peel on the edges after a few weeks and I had to cut the edges off where they were peeling and eventually had to take it off and put another one on. After that one started to peel, I just got frustrated and put the Best Buy one back on and took a Magic Marker across the whole thing so at least it looks a little more manly.In my opinion, stay away from these Gadget Grips, they are a waste of money; even at the $5 I paid for them."
2,"worked sweet, but for short time only","My intent was to use these to enable better grip on my Samsung Vibrant (Galaxy S) phone, which is very sleek and light, and I was trying to avoid using a full skin/cover for the phone. I applied about 4 of the iGadget Grips stickers to my phone. They stuck for maybe a month, and when they did stick, they did a great job of providing better grip. But slowly and surely, they started peeling back, falling off, and as of right now I only have one sticker left on the phone. I don't know where the others are, as they fall off when pulling the phone out of my pocket, and I don't realize they have fallen off until they're gone. I could go on like this, replacing stickers every month or so if this product was cheaper, but not for the price they are charging. Thus, I will likely give in and end up getting a full-body skin for my Samsung Galaxy S phone."
2,Does not stay with your device,"I have used eGrips before and loved it - but its absurdly expensive. I was hoping for an affordable alternative in this product... NOT. It has a sticky surface like those pieces of plastic you can smack on your window for sun shades but which easily relocates by peeling back off. That is exactly what this Gadget Grips does, it peels off whatever you have attached it to easily. So it is in no way an equivalent to eGrips sticker that stays put. I can't help but suspect they are playing on the success of eGrips by naming it the way they have. Do not bee fooled - it is not a permanent non slip solution for devices."
1,Waste of money,This product is not very good. It doesnt grip well and therefore serves me no purpose whatsoever! It is flimsy at best. Other sticky grip items I have seen hold a full size laptop in place and this one cant handle a small phone
2,curling problem,"After just a couple of months the edges begin to curl on the product making it useless. Worked great initially then you have to wash it every day to get it to have the same ""sticky/tacky"" quality"
1,undeliverable??,"For some reason this item was deemed ""undeliverable"" and I was going to give it as a present, SO, when Christmas rolled along, I was unable to give this gift. No clear explanation was given to me about WHY it was ""undeliverable"" but I was disappointed. If you are unable to ship to my address, TELL ME BEFORE I PAY FOR IT PLEASE!"
4,HOW TO KEEP 'EM DOWN ON THE FARM,"This little-known thriller is not a typical ""torture"" flick ala SAW or HOSTEL. It's a chilling journey down the paths of guilt and greed, played against a terrifying bucolic background. The performers are strong and the script clever and unpredictable, loaded with enigmatic flashbacks going in unexpected directions.It's a dark journey with unsettling scenes of cruelty and violence..but it's a good genre entry."
2,And now a moral from the director...,"Both torture-porn AND a morality tale (killing is BAD!) (yep, that's the message) this film becomes downright silly (complete with glowing demon eyes and a heavy-handed lesson) and throws away an intriguing premise. Rife with hilarious dialogue (on approaching a farmhouse after a car accident a young couple has this exchange: Him: I hope someone's home. Her: Yeah, me too.) and acting replete with serious, slow delivery, this film can only be described as a complete time-waster."
5,Shocking,"I Love this movie. I wonder why it wasnt included in the 8 Fangoria's and excluded The Haunting?? lol.. This movie, is violent, and grapic, and i love it. The ending is very Haunting, Chilling, creepy, and surprising. Shoul have been in theaters. A Really good movie, and isn't a B movie, it is an A movie!"
2,Dogs Decoded,"This product had excellent information, but the DVD was scratched and unable to watch. it was returned for replacement that has NOT been received as of July 4th, 2012. Hope you can help."
2,Overwhelmingly underwhelming,"Nat Adderley had a great tone but was never really a very profound improvisor. More of a crowd-pleaser. And the very talented saxophone players on this session have few chances to shine, massed as they are in a Big Sax Section. Trapped somewhere between hard bop and big band jazz, it's as gimmicky as it sounds."
5,Proclaim Liberty Throughout All the Land,For daughter in college - saved $ over the college bookstore!
2,Not worth the orange,"I wouldn't play thirty bucks for this or even ten. With a regular knife, you can easily cut yourself some orange wedges for snacking, or stick to the half-grapefruit and spoon. The cleanup for this gadget is not worth the ""convenience"" and the device still requires as much work as a manual juicer. However, the device will end up juicing some of the fruit, so if your kids like your fruit ""in its own juice"" rather than wedges with the inner skin, you'll want this. Likewise, if you need several oranges worth of peeled pieces for a church's worth of fruit salad or jello, this should save you some tedium. The cutting blade looks innocuous, but keep it away from the kids."
5,This book is adorable! (-my wife),"I got the cow book as a shower gift and fell in love with it! I had to have this one! I'm glad they only make 3 animals, because I would probably end up spending too much money trying to collect all of them! Super cute and fun!"
3,"Cute, but doesn't last","This is a very fun book. We've bought it twice now. Unfortunately, the sound button lasts only a few weeks, even if you're careful with it."
4,happymom,Very cute book! It is perfect for my 5 month old to chew on and snuggle with while we're reading. It is very soft and comes with 1 sound (barking) which is fun. It's not very long but works for a young baby.
1,Poor quality recording,"The sound quality for all operas in the set was poor, but Cosi Fan Tutte was absurdly awful. It was recorded at a concert, and contains lots of loud coughing and performers' feet clomping around on stage. Also, the recording equipment was apparently placed somewhere weird, because the voices fade in and out, and some instruments sound louder than others."
3,"Good ""Don Giovanni""","Disastrous ""Nozze"" with unjustified fast tempi (two stars), mediocre ""Cosi"" with no insight to music (better to listen to 1955 Bohm, 1993 Mackerras or 1974 Davis) and good ""Don Giovanni"", especially Commendatore final Scene. Three stars"
4,Handy Reference,"Although I spend time looking for children's literature which I can tie into music units, this book -though a bit dated - has really come in handy. It has provided some very educational and entertaining activities relating to books that children may already be familiar with, or new lit for them to enjoy. I recommend it for the creative teacher looking for a new twist on a variety of musical topics or just wants some refreshing new ideas they can work into their classes. We all need something to inspire us here and there."
3,Lacks performance,"Finally managed to assemble Nexstar but one of the tripod legs has a missing piece, hence exposing metal leg andmaking tripod unstable. The Nexstar looks great but tripod is rather short forcing the user to kneel low to look intoeye piece. I have been unable to extend the legs. The extension pieces are rather short, hence willlook for a taler tripod for ease of use."
5,Two Sympatico Musicians,"Joe Pass and Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen are the two best on jazz guitar and acoustic bass, respectively, who ever lived. To hear them together, and the operative word is ""together"" is a treat all too rare for jazz lovers."
5,Absolutely Superb!,"The Tarantula Whisperer brought some tears and plenty of joy and laughter to me. I got the sense that Dr. Pasten is very passionate about her veterinary work and is equally passionate about sharing the special human-animal bond with her audience. Her creative writing geniously intertwines real-life stories about her clients and personal companions and gives simple, yet interesting approaches to making your pets happy...Happiness is what it's all about, isn't it?I'm anxiously awaiting her next book!"
2,What a disappointment,"Intrigued by the title and encouraged by the rave reviews, I was not prepared for my level of disappointment with this book. It struck me that Dr. Pasten was so busy thinking of a rejoinder to everyone that I found it hard to believe she actually listened to what the animals were saying to her. Or perhaps she just related better to animals. I found her sense of humor appallingly offensive for a book of this nature. I kept waiting for her to NOT have a smart comment at the end of each story which I'm sure was meant to be humorous but was often just silly. Please, save your money."
5,Great book for animal lovers,"""Tarantula Whisperer"" is not a book about spiders! It is a wonderfully entertaining, educational book on understanding animals, communciating with them and caring about and for them. With fun anecdotes from her vet practise, Pasten gives us unusual insights and untraditional advice. My dogs and I highly recommend it."
4,Super,it was a really interesting book to read and is a great introduction for anyone interested in alternative animal medicine it had some good general points about communicating with animals and brought up some issues that you would have never thought of.
4,"Together with their album ""Magic Fly"" this is the best of the french group Space.","Listen to it more than once to appreciate it, because it is not your usual predictable commercial music.It will leave a positive mark on you."
5,Every home should have one,"All my friends and neighbors want to borrow this book. You can fix literally anything within your home by yourself. There are certain situations where you are asked to call a professional, such as an electrician, plumber, HVAC person, etc - but those are only in dire circumstances.This book walks you through all the scenarios, is easy to read, and every home should have one.Now I point all my friends and neighbors to Amazon.com if they want to borrow my book. Ha ha ha!"
5,Best book I ever bought,This is the best book a own. I use it for around the house fix ups and it is great it has saved me a lot of money in repair bills.
5,Great Christmas Fun,"This CD is really fun for Christmas. I also ownMeowy ChristmasI love to play these CDs and watch my critters go crazy. What's really fun is playing the CDs a getting the music stuck in people's heads. Specially the lyrics: Ruff ruff ruff, ruff ruff ruff. Ruff, ruff, ruff ,ruff ruff."
3,A Must Have For Dog Lovers,This CD is definitely high on the humor scale. I purchased this product because I work at a veterinary clinic and we are using it as our hold music this Holiday season. Our clients have gotten a big kick out of it.
2,It's time for old Kris Kringle.,"After producer Mike Spalla had success with twoJingle CatsChristmas albums, it was natural for him to release a third one. But he must have sensed that people might grow tired of Jingle Cats, so for the third album he switched to ""Jingle Dogs"". It's the same concept, except with dogs barking instead of cats meowing. It is billed as ""real doggies sing holiday classics"", but of course it's fake. Barking dogs were recorded on a sampler and then played back with a keyboard to ""bark"" Christmas melodies. By the way, the Jingle Cats appear on most of the songs. The songs include familiar Christmas songs and not-so-familiar ones (""Pat-a-Pan""?). The last song here is an original silly song which includes actual words sung by the ""Jingle Elves"" (sped up human voices). This album is somewhat amusing for a song or two, but it gets tiresome after a while."
4,"Useful, accurate, and nasty","This book is full of deliciously vulgar phrases. I wouldn't recommend actually using them unless you want a black eye, but as far as I can tell, having spent a summer in Poland, they're mostly accurate and up to date. The author also provides many literal translations, which are usually the funniest phrases in the book.I was surprised to find that the book has almost no religious profanity. This seems strange, given that Poland is about 95% Catholic, and the author doesn't indicate if it's an omission or if there simply aren't any such curses. I also would have liked a scale of some sort to indicate which phrases were obscene and which were merely naughty. Still, it's a fun book, and if you've ever been ripped off by a Warsaw cab driver it's a useful one too."
3,Skeptical at first.,I gave the book to my dad and he did not know what to think. It started out slow but by the middle of the book he was laughing out loud.
4,"yes, sounds familiar.....","This is a good slang-type of dictionary. The phrases or words are colorful because ordinary terms are used in a vulgar meaning. Hence, most of the entries are translated into the English 'F-word.' But are funny if you think about the literal meaning of the words. It makes American vulgar-slang look so boring and limited to a few words. I don't know why the other reviewer thought there should be religious references because the book seems to be thorough (I'm not sure that any cultures have religious obscenities for that matter)."
4,Cool Car!,"I bought this toy for someone as a gift for Christmas and it was the favorite gift of the year. The only problem with the car is that the rear bumper and wheel wings are supposed to click back into their hidden place just by pushing then in, but something inside the mechanism doesn't seem to work. Not a big deal, but it would be nice if it worked for display purposes, to change the look once in a while.Still a good product for the price in my opinion."
4,"CLASSIC CAR, ESPECIALLY THE BOX IT CAME IN.","I also had this car as a kid when growing up in the 1970s. I remember seeing the movie at least 2-3 times, and couldnt wait until christmas to get my lotus corgi car, but the box that it came in is also a collectable. Box had a lot of pictures with Roger Moore at all of the many locations used in the film. Today this car along with the original box of course goes for 150-200 dollars. Again classic from an excellent movie."
2,Well...,"This is one excellent song. This single/ EP has 4 versions. A short version like the main cd, and 3 other versions/ mixes. The 3 other versions do not sound like the original at all...and tend to take Johnette's brilliant sultry voice from the original and places it in music that barely sounds like the original song..even in tone. Where as the original was an angry, haunting tragic slice of 90's goth with a crawling deep bass line, the mixes fail the song miseably, dragging it through a tune that doesn't match the vocals at all.My advice? Just buy the main album for the longer version, and only buy this if you need a shortened version. Toss the mixes away!"
2,"3 years old ""new"" blades","I'm very very disappointed at Amazon, this review is not towards this product, but worth your consideration.I received my shipment today (November 2010), but the two blades was 2007. 3 years old. No matter what technology it is, it's rubber. If you left an eraser in the drawer for three years, it becomes very sticky. 3 years window sealant begins to crack. I guess similar things could happen to these two 2007 years blades too.I was planning to return it, but mail such a big box could cost a lot.Bottom line is selling me a 3 year old rubber equals to selling me a 1 year old food. Amazon sold me some good stuff, but after this incidence I will take cautions before buying."
1,does a poor job,"This size wiper is for the drivers side of my Ion. It came out of the box with quite a curve on it (concave) and after installation, it leaves most of the middle of its wipe area untouched. I originally saw an add for this type wiper in a magazine and thought it would be great, and was willing to spend the extra$ for a really good wiper, but its very disappointing. The passenger side wiper seems to work ok though."
3,Fair wiper,"These wiper blades are okay. They are far superior to the OEM blades, but I am not sure they are worth the premium price. The driver side blade developed a streak in the middle of the windshield, which appears to be caused by a nick in the blade. Is this a defect in the rubber or caused by something from the road? I can't be sure, but at these prices I'm not going to discard it until I get my money's worth. It is too bad, I really wanted to like these wiper blades."
2,Just average..nothing fancy.,Although the Bosch 419B ICON Wiper Blade did not leave a streak but its life was just average..the wipers were worn out in just one season. Not bad if you get a deal on this wiper...otherwise just average.
3,"great at first, but slacks off after a while","+ great at first+smooth and even wiping action+low noise+nice looking+easy to assemble=works fine after 6 month, just not perfect.-the rubber chips off easily and stay chipped, which leads to...-...streaks after a few month of using."
2,NO better than any other blade,"Other than costing a fortune, I found no difference in this very expensive set of blades than the cheaper ones. Mine are a year old and I have to blast the radio to drown out the rubbing noise. THey leave streaks in the same places the cheaper blades left streaks. The only thing that impressed me was the nerve it took to charge this amount of money for these blades.Sorry, but I calls 'em as I sees 'em."
3,Decent,"They are well made, offering the hope of long service. Good sound quality. Comfortable earpads. Good length cord, but it might be a bit thin. There is NO padded headband as claimed in the Amazon listing. I got it a bit cheaper from another source, and am satisfied that I got my money's worth. Twenty bucks is a little too much."
1,the ear pieces were too big....,"the ear pieces were too big to be placed inside the ear. which means, i can only place it loosely, and hence it comes off at the slightest head movement. not at all satisfied :("
5,I eats me spinach!,"On 12/02/2006,I got invited to go to my friend's house and he had this on videotape. I watched it and thought it was funny. I especially liked it when sinbad's bird captured popeye and then popeye turned the bird into a meal. If you want to know more info, I suggest you watch the video"
3,Way Too Sweet,"The packaging as near as I could tell on Amazon was exactly the same as the zero sugar Vanilla flavored protein powder which we've bought several times now. Wanting to try something new, I got the chocolate, thinking that it too would be near zero sugar.Not used to sweet drinks anymore, this made me a bit sick to my stomach the first time I had it. I now cut it with bitter/salty flavors to drink in the morning. I won't buy it again as it's not slow carb friendly. I'll switch back to Vanilla until they change this recipe."
4,Requirde Reading,This is one of three books required by the Seminar for the Dogmatic Theology course. We have not started to read it yet.
2,"No Bling, I Got Zinged!!!!","This ring does not have a decent sparking eye catcher, it looks like plastic with some sparkle. if you get the ring it certain light.I re-ordered another CZ ring, as I am not willing to throw in the towel, as I have had no problems with all merchandise-this ring was sent by an outside vendor.George Perrier"
3,It's okay...,"The ring looks really pretty in the picture, but it's okay in real life. I guess I had a high expectation for the ring since it did cost 15 bucks (plus tax). It's just not as ""glittery"" as the picture. Otherwise, the quality is good. It comes with a heart-shape box. If you want a promise/purity/engagement ring, then I say buy the expensive rings AND it looks (at least)better in real life so you feel that you haven't waste any money."
3,Still here,I was not as pleased as I'd hoped to be when my ring came. Smaller then expected and stones smaller also. The shipping was very fast and company attitude was wonderful.
5,Absolutely perfect!,"My fiancee and I purchased this ring as my wedding band to accompany my 2 carat solitaire. It is absolutely perfect in its classical elegance and is a perfect match with my engagement ring. We had originally looked at just a plain band, but went with ring instead - and I couldn't be happier! Will post a picture in 9 days when we are married!! =]"
3,"Not bad, not great","I've waited a few weeks to post this because I wanted to see how the ring held up. I've worn it maybe 10 times and it seems to be holding up ok. However the stones in the ring have very little sparkle and don't really show up well. They are a decent size and the ring itself is very realistic looking but there is no life to the ring. It is most likely due to the princess cut of the stone which has very little light refraction. I should have stuck with the round stones and I'm sure I would have been happier. All in all, the ring is good just not exactly what I was looking for."
5,Perfect...just what I needed,"During my pregnancy, I was sad to find that my rings no longer fit. I bought this ring largely based on the positive reviews and the fact that it looks essentially just like my wedding band.I was not disappointed. The ring looks beautiful, and I feel confident wearing it. I can tell it's not real just by comparing it to my wedding ring, but I don't believe anyone else would ever guess without detailed scrutiny. I also am glad I don't have to worry about the plating coming off and the ring looking brassy since the sterling silver ring with rhodium plating keeps a shiny, white gold appearance, just like my real ring.The 4MM size was bigger than I expected but not a problem since I have slightly larger hands. The price was right, and I'm very happy with the ring."
2,Not very satisfied,"The packaging was suprisingly pretty it came in a heart shaped box with a bow. The ring in itself was very beautiful and fit perfectly albiet a few centimeters bigger than a regular 8 the only problem is the beauty only lasted about 2 maybe 3 weeks then the ""silver"" looked like a cheap imitation with no sparkle or brilliance as in the first few days.The shipper though was wonderful it arrived much faster than expected and I experienced no problems with that. Sadly the ring is sitting on my counter in its original box now and has been reduced to a fond memory."
4,Liked,Came fast was right sizeWas very nice lookingAnd the kids were very happy to give to there mom
2,OK,"Looks great and a good deal, but placing of the stones could be better. One of the stones looked like it was jammed in so the housing is scraped and the stone seems out of place. Like the way it fits and looks good, but would not buy again."
4,Wondering what kind of cut???,"Well I got this ring for myself because my fiancee and i decided to push our wedding up by four months and it is right around the corner and well lets face it i had two weeks to get a wedding band and had to afford it right now too...Anyway, I couldn't tell by the pictures what cut the stones are in the ring, but I ordered it anyway (did i mention i was in a hurry???). The stones are princess cut and i really wanted round to match the ones in my engagement ring, (even though our plan is to replace it with real) but this ring is absolutely gorgeous. You can't tell that it isn't real...looks genuine next to my white gold engagement ring...Actually it looks better, shiner cuz my engagement ring band is scratched.So if you want my advice, I love this ring and am definitely happy with what i ordered."
5,Sterling Silver Band,"The ring is beautiful!! It fits perfectly and it's very light. I love it! It took a while for me to get the ring, but it was worth it."
1,Description does not match part number,Ordered initially by a search for -8 to -4 AN reducer. As an afterthought I researched the part number through the Aeroquip Catalog:[...]According to this catalog part# FCM2160 is a -8 to -6 AN reducer. Part# FCM2049 is a -8 to -4 AN reducer.
4,Too sad,"I find this album too sad, Ella voice is just not up to it, especially on how high the moon, where her voice just can't do the magic, that it had done 15 years earlier in Berlin. This is for die hard fans (which I am). If you are looking for a good live concert, buy Ella in Berlin, Ella returns to Berlin or at the Opera House, which are all late 50's, early 60's and sound fantastic. If you are looking for a later concert, then buy Ellaa nice, where her voice is not as frayed around the edges."
4,An answer to Jonathan Livingstone Seagull?,"Godhanger is a very nice novel with a subtle religious content, very different from most books in this genre. I see it in the class of C.S.Lewis' Narnian Chronicles, and perhaps (only the author can confirm this) it was intended as an answer to Jonathan Livingstone Seagull, that New-Age rendition of Christ as a buddhist bird."
1,Don't waste your money.,Not much to write about...uninspiring. A waste of time. Perhaps back in the 60's and 70's this mysteries and aloof approach had its appeal. He is so wrapped up in his own nirvanna and makes it redundently and painfully clear he is not going to share it or reveal anything worth the effort of ones attention.
2,Not super impressed,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my neice. When it arrived it was merely 2 identical variety packs of lip balm crammed into an otherwise empty cardboard box. Not a great ""gift"" presentation and doesn't show that or tell you that in the description. I could have gone to the local drugstore and done something prettier myself for less money. Luckily my neice did like the flavors, so I guess it worked out."
1,"So delicious, my daughter can't stop eating it straight","My daughter came home from school yesterday with this product that her friend gave her. At first I didn't notice it. Then when she said she had candy I looked at it. A bunch of kids had been eating this. It's probably harmless, it might make stomachs upset, but there is absolutely no information on the individual packaging."
1,Beware Kindle Owners..Big Problem with Format Here!,"Thank Goodness Amazon Customer Service is first-rate. I just easily got a credit for this book & the book TRIPLE THREAT in the same series. Both were removed from my Kindle & my archives.I purchased both books after reading the first book of the series on my Kindle and finding it a ""fun"" read. These two, however, formatted without any quotation marks, were no fun at all. I recommend you try a sample first to see if the formatting problem has been addressed before you purchase any of the books in this series."
3,Too Much Not Enough,"This is a book that is very enjoyable to look at and if something catches your fancy you can read about it. The problenm is that there is not enough information written. Another problem is that there are too many topics covered, none in detail. If you are casually interested in the arts and crafts of New Mexico this book will suffice. This is a good starting point to do further research. The photographs are magnificent tributes to the artists work and give you some basic information but if you really want to know more you'd better look elsewhere The collection and photographs included in the text are numerous and very colorful and beautiful. If you want a nice overview and to look at pretty pictures this book will do. There is an adequate glossary and bibliography but if you're really interested in this subject you might try the Spanish Colonial Arts Society."
3,same old same old,"Too offten the exploitation of the charm of New Mexico takes a back seat to the authentic lifestyle of the Spanish people of New Mexico. Across Frontiers:Hispanic Crafts of New Mexico is a well calculated attempt to placate to status qou of many who simply want to promote tourism. Still this is a slightly better approch, since it contains some historical content"
2,too much negativity,"In the end, this book made a profound spiritual point. The problem is that there were hundreds of pages filled with negativity to get there. The protagonist is filled with angst, which Karasu describes in excruciating detail. In the end, I think this book is very much like Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist, but Of God and Madness is a much more dry, intellectual, difficult read."
3,A Mixed Bag From Aretha's Little Sister,"This really is a decent collection of soul material from Aretha's little sister. She has a great voice but the material is weak. Some songs are spot on top notch soul but it really only boils down to about 5 or 6 tracks. That means there's quite a number of tracks that are lacking and a number that sound fairly dated (particullarly the song about Muhammad Ali). If your looking for a lost soul gemm this isn't it. I'm not saying to turn away from this album either because their are some cool songs, just beaware."
1,Failure prone,"We have these as under the counter lights. They're uniformly awful. They work for a few month, if you are lucky. Then the lamps don't make good contact with the sockets and go out. New bulbs obviously don't help. Sometimes you can clean the socket with contact cleaner and they'll work for a few more days, but then they go out again. Awful, awful, awful! Replaced with the ""new and improved"" version. Same problem. Tried another brand of these from another supplier with the same result. Avoid low-voltage halogen and xenon under counter lights.Ah! I hear my wife screaming from the kitchen again. Those stupid lights must be out again."
2,Need to be an electrician,I bought this almost 3 years ago and have not used it. Feel like you need to be an electrician to hook this up. Maybe one day I will get one to put it together when I have another job in the house to do. :(
1,"Great, WHEN IT WORKS...","I installed one of these a about 2 years ago, had problems with the lights falling apart, transformer going south, and the ""touch"" dimmer switch that I also ordered going south as well.It is a good looking, easy to install set, when it works.I did not learn my lesson, and ordered another set to install in my daughter's kitchen 3 1/2 months ago, finally got around to install it, and the transformer only works on one of the two outputs. Tried to send it back and according to Amazon ""Return Window expired""Crappy product, crappy warranty,STAY AWAY!!"
1,Garbage product,Purchased the complete 20 watt Halogen Under Cabinet Light Kit plus Touch Pad Dimmer about 6 years ago. It has never worked more than a few days. I have replaced every component at least once. Now the dimmer does not work. This stuff is garbage.
1,Pass on this one,"It's just a bunch of babies making noises while Christmas music is being played.I was VERY disappointed in this lackluster CD,and I gave it away.This is nothing exciting like Jungle Cats or barking dogs-all you get is just babies sitting around gurling and cooing to Xmas music,that's all."
4,The Stuff They Come Up With...,"This cd is very unique,but isnt the best cd to listen to.I barely gave it 4 stars.After listening to about 7 songs you begin to get tired of it.But it is funny overall.Its neat how they blended and edited all those babies sounds into with the beat of the music.I saw it at the store and my wife was pregnant with our twin girls at the time,so i bought it so she would get a kick out of it.Now my girls dance to it.My favorite is ""Up On The Housetop"".Its got a cool sound and beat."
2,Why this book is confusing,"This book is confusing because 1) it often (usually?) skips several steps in its mathematical explanations, 2) it sometimes does not explain the reasons for its conclusions, and 3) some of its explanations are based on previously introduced information that the reader has likely already forgotten, which would be okay if only the book reminded the reader of the previously introduced information. Space wasted on cute comments could have been better used to include missing steps and information. Some steps require knowledge of calculus. ""The Easy Way"" is a misleading title."
2,"Not that good, in fact, a little confusing","I purchased this ""Easy Way"" because the Geometry The Easy Way is one of the best books I've ever seen as a compilation of Geometry information and practice problems. However, I think that this book would be confusing for a student. I taught high school for 5 years, and currently own a tutoring company. If you want a statistics overview, I recomend looking somewhere else."
2,Another confusing run through stats...,"There has to be a book SOMEWHERE that describes statistics for the layman. Again, this is not it."
1,Could have been 1/2 as thick,Description neglected to mention that the second half of this 700+ page book is the first half repeated. Surprised a publisher would produce such a thing and Amazon would be involved in selling it.
2,Stay Away,"If you do not want to waste your hours trying to get this thing work, stay away. It worked fine initially, but when I reconnected it some time later, it couldn't connect. I know a bit about networking and spend a lot of time trying to get it work again to no avail. Buy a wireless router instead. It is not a hardware issue, the drivers and the software is crappy and very unstable."
2,Does not perform,"In the product details for the Wifi Max for DS, it says specifically that it allows you to transfer mp3's and video from your computer to your DS. It absolutely does not do that. It does provide a DS Wifi connection, but if you're expecting the multimedia functions, do not buy this. Maybe you can use it for mp3's and video for the PSP, but it's advertised as doing these things for the DS.I'd appreciate it if whoever writes the product details for Amazon would double check the capabilities before they put an item up."
5,Best wifi card ever,Just wanted to tell you that the wifi max card is the best wifi card ever. Has the right chipset for my linux box thank you.
1,Not a very good product - at all,"Minimal instructions (for the DS) and very unprofessional looking applications make this product a waste of time and money. I got it installed and briefly saw a MAC address appear in a window, but still the DS reported an unsuccessful connection test. That was the best it ever got, after that, the MAC address wouldn't even appear any more. Even after disabling WEP, no joy. This product is schizophrenic. It's packaged with NINTENDO DS all over the box, but most setup instructions are for the PSP!! Weird."
3,don't buy this unless you know what your doing,i bought the nintendo wifimax a few months ago and it didn't work for me either the instructions were terrible its like its expecting you to know everything but i didin't i bought to go on mario kart online but everytime i tried it kept saying unable to obtain ip address i all that rubbish so i tried to swap the internet connection to my other pc by drilling a hole in the wall and putting the extension cord and hoped it worked but in the end i broke the modem and we had to get a new one but strangly enough what took me months on my old modem to set up it suddenly worked and i was online before i got all my wifi games for christmas so now im happy playing on mario kart ds and metroid prime but i would advise anyone to check if there modem is compatible or ust buy a wireless router
1,Only Broadband,"It doesn't say anywhere on the box or in the lit that it only accepts a broadband connection. I was hoping to finally be able to get to the wii shopping channel even though I live in a rural area with no cell, cable or dsl. I still can't and now I have to take this junk back to the store for a refund."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS,"This device does not make having a wireless connection as easy as it sounds. It claims on the box ""Turn any internet enabled PC into a wi-fi access point."" It fails to mention, however, that you need a wireless network card, which is lame because you can just use that to connect to the internet. If you don't have a network card and just try to plug this into your computer (as I did), it will not work. Save time and don't bother buying this."
1,"For heaven's sake, don't confuse this with opera!","Sheesh, the marketing mavens are at it AGAIN!With all due respect to the admirable enthusiasm of the previous reviewer, EMI has effectively shortchanged him with this collection of highlights. Let's be absolutely clear about this: an opera is more than an assemblage of bleeding hunks. An opera is (or should be) a large-scale work with both a dramatic and a musical arc. Both of these arcs are undercut and mangled in the process of selecting highlights, thus providing a falsified picture of what the composer, librettist(s), conductor and cast intended."
2,minimal engineering,Drilled about 50 railroad ties to pin with re-bar for a retaining wall. Using 5/8 bit. It bent after a while and finally broke. I feel it could have been made heavier but I did buy the cheapest sowasn't too surprised. Finished with larger bit. Would have bought better quality if I expected to need more usage.
3,Good cover. Rotten belt clip.,"I like the Kroo cover. It snapped right on the phone and is easy to take off and put on. It's also thin and light. Don't buy this for the belt clip, though. It's a worthless piece of plastic junk. The first time I put it on, the phone fell off and the clip stayed connected to my pocket. Not good with a phone as expensive as the Razr."
3,Nice cover but do you get it on,Ok I just received my cover and it seems like it will provide good protection if I an get it on without ripping it. Any hints from anyone?
5,Joy in spite of circumstances,"After a near death hiking fall, Tim Hansel was soon to realize that his injuries were permanent and so would be the pain. As a young married Christian guy,he was faced with questions which he couldn't answer. He didn't know whether it was hardest to deal with the pain or the doubt, the frustration or the fear.Coming to a critical place in his life, he knew he had to choose either to break down or break through. Realiizing that his pain was inevitable, but that misery was optional, he decided to live his life with joy.Using his personal journal in which he recorded his thoughts and feelings, he has written a book in which he lifts up the wonderful attributes of God Who is our day-to-day source of strength and joy.""Make me to hear joy and gladness, Let the bones which Thou hast broken rojoice. Psalm 51:8 NASB"
4,New York fan feeling this album!!!!,"Hey this album is supertight kid! Who is this guy named Tony Pacasso on the album he is one of the hardest underground cats since DMX and 50 cent. Im from New York and we usually dont get alot of Memphis underground rappers in our city and we need that cause these cats are gonna rip tha rap game up soon! If people like listening to Jay-Z, Nas, Ludacris, or any other hot artists this group Gameshootaz is the group to listen to. I looked at the editors comments and seen what they said about the Gameshootaz and I think they are absolutely right cause Gameshootaz will be the next hot act out of Memphis to be signed since 8Ball & MJG got with Bad Boy. Be on the lookout for their label Game Over Enterprise cause they are hot and they are proven their point by spitting pure fire on every track!!!!!!!!"
4,Atl Crunk,"Whats up Shawty they got tight delivery on this album. Tha production is off tha chain and they aint slippin in no categories. I seen em do a show at Tha Bounce for Hitman Sammy Sam one time and they were getting crunk and no one knew who they were then but they will soon. This is a album you have to pick up cause []its a underground classic so folks you gotta grab it. Big Yo speaks about his uncle getting killed on ""Revenge"" and im feeling all his anger on that joint. People get ready for a major come up on this 1!!! Shawty out!!!"
3,More Gangsta music tha betta,"Yeah I like this one tha song with Ferentino and Tre Levy on crushin out here, I stayed in Memphis for a while and what tha hell is Blackhaven but anyway them boys are major talented and it would be a shame for an A&R person to pass em by. You would be a real... not to get this c.d. its only $$ and that cat named Tony Pacasso has a voice like that dude from tha now defunct label Suave House Mr. Mike and that n**ga scare me just listening to em. Mississippi is feeling this album it I wouldnt mind seeing them team up with my boy DAVID BANNER. I gave em 3 stars cause I didnt see em do any promoting on this album.........I GUESS THATS WHY THEY CALL IT UNDERGROUND"

3,Good book,"The book was not as informative as I would have liked for it to have been. It was good, but I had hoped for more in depth information."
2,Too Wordy,I think this volume was way too wordy and contains too much information. The text could have been streamlined tremendously.
4,"Informative, Focus on NATURAL childbirth","This DVD is very informative and it was great to watch from home at our convenience versus attending an expensive and time consuming class. I feel that Dee does a nice job preparing expectant parents for labor / delivery and even postpartum care for mom and baby . There is a definite emphasis on natural childbirth, and Dee only briefly discusses pain relief options, such as the standard epidural, and other medical interventions. I found the DVD to be very helpful, but I would have appreciated a slightly more balanced approach to covering all pain relief techniques and options."
4,In a Pinch,My husband and I decided not to take the pregancy classes offered. This video was perfect for us to watch in our own time and in the comfort of our home. Lots of information!
5,The Developing Mind: How relationships and the brain interact to shape who we are,"A great book. Clear, precise, well documented. A joy to read. As a psychoterapist it is the book I was waiting. At the end all problems come from the brain function, and the book helps to understand why some people have problems that resist ""normal"" therapy, and what to do. I read it as a mistery novel with surprises at every page."
1,Don't waste your money,"I'm not brilliant, nor am I stupid. I am a doctoral level psychologist who has read many books on neurophysiology, memory, cognition, attachment, etc. I regret having bought and read this book. It is repetitive, repetitive, repetitive. If you take out the repetition, it doesn't say much that is new. Largely, we don't know, we can hypothesize, we need more research."
3,what is he trying to say?,The author uses a hundred words when he could have gotten the message across with ten. There are better books out there on the topic.
1,"Not appealing, not anything..........","This book was at times dull and boring, often put me to sleep during my Spanish class. I guess the parts dealing with the battles were alright, but the weddings and dialogue were horendous."
1,Junk,The plastic tab at the top which secures the phone broke on the VERY FIRST day I used it. Avoid.
1,"Broken twice during normal use, poor product","I thumb the release, it breaks. After only one week. They send me a new one, two weeks later, I thumb the release, it breaks. I bet they would send me another one, but instead I threw it in the trash. Don't waste your time and money. By the way, my time is worth more than my money."
2,Celestron8x22 Essential or Gimmic?,"I find this item to be handy & lightweight/pocket sized, but all pictures are very grainy and therefore the item can only be considered as a 'snapshot device'. More of a gimmic than an essential item for people such as birdwatchers."
3,worth what I paid!,"I found these to be well worth the $34.00 that I paid for them from Beach camera,but I would have been very disapointed if I had paid $89.95 like some of the other sites are asking!"
3,"Product definition is not high, the quality of some of the problems, and sometimes can not shoot photos.","Product definition is not high, the quality of some of the problems, and sometimes can not shoot photos."
1,Lithium Ion Battery for Audiovox VX6600,"I purchased two batteries so I could have a spare. One battery worked fine the other battery charged up okay but about 15 minutes after installing the fully charged battery into my pocket pc phone, it went dead. I put it on the charger but it will not take a charge. I guess you would call this infant mortality. As you can tell I am not happy."
1,Why?,They've butchered a favorite. I've heard better versions of Rocky Top performed by 8 year olds at Silver Dollar City.
1,Incomplete shipment,I did not receive product packaging or instructions. I did contact seller twice by email. Finally received an email after I left negative feedback. Asked if I would remove negative feedback. No way. They said they would email me product instructions. This was two weeks ago. Have received nothing. I believe I should receive a shipping credit!
3,Feels great on your eyes.,"They feel great on your eyes. Refrigerated it, and works like a charm. Old reliable solution. No unpleasant surprises here."
3,""" It's OOOkay""",I think I was just born with a line/ bags- But this does work to reduce mine- Not completely gone but at night after a long day I wash my face and cut one in half put each piece under my eye n it feels refreshing and cool. Wake up and ma eyes look a little better/ I put an entire one over my eyes.
1,not natural containsparabens,"The first 4 ingredients are/aqua (water),butylene glycol,glycerin and sorbitol. Also contains methylparaben, ethylparaben, imidazolidinyl urea. I am not inclined to put these ingredients on delicate eye tissue. Yet another item not worth returning -- may try to find another use but wouldn't give as a gift."
1,Disappointed,"I've used these eye pads many times in the past for my clients during treatment, but never ordered them through Amazon. Gave it a shot due to the lower price, but they were all dried out. BOTH JARS! Will pay a little more and stick with my previous supplier on these."
5,Mind blowing,A must see movie. How far will you go to get a job? Wait and see what these candidates will do to clinch the job of a LIFETIME.
1,Save yourself the time,This movie is so obvious and it took me all of 10 minutes to see where the plot was going. It's basically The Breakfast club meets The Usual Suspects.
4,Interesting premise; Overall worthwhile.,"The trailers make it look interesting. I didn't think I would like this film, but it was worthwhile and interesting to watch and I am glad I watched it. is different and I liked it. This is not a classic thriller in the sense it will scare you like a horror film. It isn't a thriller. It will scare you in the sense it will show you the character of people. In this film, eight persons are put in a sealed room to take an exam that will get one person a highly coveted position with this powerful company. See some at their worst and others at their best as they vye to be the last one standing. Don't expect any chills or thrills. this is a character study. Overall, a worthwhile film I have no problem recommending to others."
2,"Not my ""cup of tea"" :)","This tea just isn't for me--I thought it was a little gross. It didn't seem to taste like chocolate OR hazelnuts.I don't really think it had much taste at all, really. Pretty disappointing. I didn't add any sugar to it, so perhaps the flavor would change a little with some sweetness?"
3,Stale product,"I bought this on Amazon becuase it disappeared from real stores. In comparison with the tea that was available in regular stores, this one has a sour off-taste, presumably, due to its oldness."
3,Vanilla nut creme Tea,"It's just ok. I thought it would taste like vanilla tea that I had elsewhere, but it doesn't. I will probably use it in the summer when I make big pitchers of iced tea."
3,Decaf tea,The tea is a very mild white tea but the raspberry favor could be stronger. I like the individual tea bags. gkshorty
5,My favorite tea!,When you add cream to this tea as far as I'm concerned it beats any kind or flavor of coffee you can ever find. It makes an excellent after dinner drink or anytime of the day drink and is much more soothing with less caffeine than coffee.
1,Couldn't even finish my cup,"I was very excited to try some tea with chocolate. Maybe I don't like hazelnut, I can't really say, but I can say that I did not like this flavor-at all. This is the only time I have strongly disliked a flavor of tea, and I will not be using any more of it."
3,I've had better,"I gave up coffee a little more than a year ago, and have been, shall I say adventurous in my pursuit of an alternative. I've become a fanatic tea drinker, and find that only those with natural ingredients are worthy. Stash makes a phenomenal lemon ginger tea- but this chocolate hazelnut, although full bodied, leaves a bad taste in my mouth- an aftertaste, that is. I believe it has to do with the fact that it has natural ""flavors"". No real chocolate or hazelnut here folks. I gave 3 stars because of the quality of the tea."
5,My favorite!,I quit drinking coffee 10 years ago. Stash's Chai Spice Tea (with our without caffeine) has become my favorite substitution. It's wonderful. My day would not be complete without it!
1,just awful,Their Earl Grey and English breakfast do not come close to the quality of Twining teas.Very disappointing. Poor quality. Lousy flavor.
3,tea that is good at good price,My daughter loves this tea and so I purchased it here.It is less expensive than the other sellers.
1,Chemicals in a bag!,I honestly don't know how this item is allowed on store shelves! It's THAT BAD!I was having trouble locating my favorite vanilla nut tea from another tea company and in its absence decided to try Stash's. I cannot even express how 'chemical' and unnatural it smelled and tasted! I had to throw it out! Will never purchase Stash again.Disregard the 1 star rating... I would give it 'zero' if I could!
3,Pricey,"Enjoy the taste of the tea, however I think it is quite pricey. May buy a cheaper brand next time."
1,No thanks!,"I bought a 10 pack sampler directly from Stash of the Decaf Vanilla Chai Tea, and I am glad that's all I bought! This is not real vanilla flavor; it has very strong notes of chemicals and artificial flavors. I tried this tea chilled with milk and sugar, and it has the same qualities of brewed potpourri. I'm not sure who could like this tea. A much better tea is Stash's Organic Black and Green Chai tea, or Green Chai tea by the same company. At least try the sample pack before buying 120 bags of this."
1,chocolate hazelnut Stash brand tea,"Don't buy it. I was so looking forward to this tea since the combination chocolate with hazelnut sounded so good. What a disappointment! It tasted very artificial, not what I expected at all and nothing like chocolate with hazelnut."
1,decaf. vanilla nut creme tea review,"This is awful! I love vanilla and nuts, and was so looking forward to this tea, but it tastes very artificial, and medicine-like. The price per box was good compared to the store's price, and certain Stash flavors aren't in the stores, but it was just not worth it."
2,not so great,"I was a little disappointed... It was too mild for me.. I tried brewing stronger, but not my cup of tea."
1,Read Stash Labels carefully.,"I bought this from my local market. My husband liked it. I happened to notice this morning when looking at the tea bag wrapper, it containted PEANUTS! No mention of that allergen was listed on the outside of the box. I fired off an email to Stash already. It seems Amazon got it listed correctly. All of my tea has now been trashed.Watch out since Stash does not seem to label the outside of their boxes."
5,The Best,It's the best Vanilla Chai Decaffeinated tea I have ever tasted! I would never buy anything else or any other brand ever!
5,decaf English breakfast tea,"For a decaf tea I think the flavor is strong and I like it. On the other hand some in my family do not like the taste. Spiced tea gets old fast, but this tea type of tea is one I can drink all the time."
5,"Great taste, great aroma","I always drink decaf tea and that limits my options. That's why I was more than happy when I found this great tasting decaf vanilla tea. I don't even add sugar or milk to this tea, I drink it as it is and it's really delicious."
5,Great Decaf Tea,"I have a tolerance problem with caffein and usually decaf tea is weak and flavorless, not this Stash decaf Chai. You can brew it for a long time and it doesn't get bitter like some teas. It is delicious. I add a couple splenda packets and some hot milk and I'm set. It's very, very good.Like some of the other reviewers, I have a hard time finding it at my local grocery stores. I go through a box a week so buying in bulk doesn't seem to be a big deal.I find that it's good iced too."
1,Disappointed in STASH PREMIEUM TEA,"STASH PREMIUM TEA has little to no taste, depending on the flavor used. The Decaf Chocolate Hazelnut Tea has absolutely NO flavor even when I try 3 tea bags to a cup of boiling water. I purchased 6 - 18 count boxes. I had tried a hot chocolate tea in one of our little delis and it was wonderful. I don't remember the name of the tea. I don't know if this is common for STASH tea or if I received an old batch. I'm sitting here with over 100 tea bags with absolutely no flavor.If you're looking for a tea with flavor, I would discourage your using this tea."
2,Swampy!,"Smells like a peat bog. My officemate complains every time I drink it. And it doesn't taste all that great, so I don't often."
2,"Tastes OK, but with a slight issue","It tastes mildly of chocolate with the addition of stevia in it. The problem though is the dental hygienist pointed out at my last cleaning that my teeth are getting unusually stained from something new I'm eating or drinking. I mentioned purchasing a ton of this tea from Amazon and she was pretty sure that was the source since I don't normally have this issue. As a result, I've mostly quit drinking it."
5,Amazing!!,"I LOVE this stuff!!! Unfortunately, I can no longer find it in the stores. I also FINALLY got my picky kids to try it, and they, too think it's AMAZING!!! DELICIOUS!!!"
1,This Flavor is Disgusting,"I love some of their other teas, I'm a chocoholic, and I love hazelnut coffee. But I HATED this flavor. It reminds me of the pharmacy's first attempts years ago to flavor medicine--has a wonderful smell but a weird, almost disgusting aftertaste. It actually made me a bit sick to my stomach! I'll stick with the Vanilla Chai--very tasty."
2,Clove tea,"I was very disappointed with this tea. I love chai, and was excited to find a decaf version. However, the tea only tastes of cloves."
2,Not my favorite,"I really thought I would like this tea, but I ended up giving it away. I like white teas, but I like green even more. I also generally like raspberry, but this combo didn't work for me. I won't buy it again."
1,rasberry white tea,I threw it away. It tasted bad. It was bitter and tasted wierd. Maybe I got a bad batch or something.
3,Great product - WRONG part number,"Check with Amazon before you purchase. I ordered this tea (and it is great tea!!!)but only 1 of the boxes arrived. Note: there should be 6 boxes of 18 count each.Contacted Amazon and they gladly placed the order again for me. Only one box arrived again! Now I have two of the boxes, at least. It's clear that the part number / QTY is incorrect. The price tells me there should be 6 boxes, but ordering this may result in only a single box arriving.Good luck!"
3,Good mix of different genres,"I have a soft spot for music from the San Francisco bay area because I lived there for a period of my life and enjoyed the musical diversity. So when I was asked to evaluate this CD, I was more than happy to oblige. The CD does exactly what the title says, it cruises down a musical highway bringing all sorts of different music formats together onto this recording. I personally enjoyed the tracks, ""My Only One"" with nice vocals from Joy de Leon, ""Sorry Saddness"", with a cool latin jazz flavor and the Carlos Santana-influenced guitar on the track, ""Sirguado"". Though I didn't care for the Hip-Hop style on the track, ""Relay the Message"", Ferdinand and company still do a good job keeping the music together on the rest of this entertaining album. Recommended!!"
3,Great Music but something was missing..,"I enjoyed this one but something was lacking in the Smooth Department great Cd for breakfast, and dinners but if you're looking for bumpin and smooth sounds it's ok but not awesome !!"
3,Ohno - Danny Tenaglia,"US CD Maxi Single Track Listing for -""OHNO"" - DANNY TENAGLIA1) Danny's Twisted Realness Mix - 10:052) The Really Twisted Beats - 4:153) Club 69's Future Mix - 9:254) Sextravaganza's Tribal Dub - 6:171996"
5,Beautiful Scenery,"You will see how beautiful Alaska is and I mean beautiful. The Gaithers travel world wide and they always have a full house. Thousands of people go to there concerts. No matter where they perform you are in for a treat. The nice thing is I can see all this from the comfort of my home. I think its easy to get hooked on the Gaither bunch, all of them are so special. What a family of probably the best singers I have every heard. ENJOY..."
3,A little too contemporary,Not too sure of this one. A little too contemporary for my liking.Not what I was expecting.
2,It's all in the approach...,"I was excited when I found ""Making Babies: The Science of Pregnancy"" and started to read it right away. It read like a biology textbook, which I expected, but I still felt like it was missing something. There was a definite absence of feeling, of understanding. Everything, from sex to conception to birth and beyond, are described in a cold, businesslike manner. Never mind that this is the biggest life-altering (and body-altering) event known to humankind. A good writer can provide facts and statistics and historical context without sounding like they're sharing observations about a new, confusing species. Then I looked at the author's name, and saw that the author was a man. Maybe that was it? Not sure, as most of the pregnancy books I've read have been authored by women. There are far better books that explain the whys and hows of pregnancy. Unless you were a biology major in college, skip this one."
3,Picked this up at a library thrift store.,"From the looks of it, its a sound blaster use and programmers guide, meant for early DOS/Windows machines, it contains descriptions of interrupt calls used to program the card from assembly. I did take a 8086 assembly class, so I can say that much about the book. I can't tell you if it is still relevant, but it looks like it would be easy to read. It also covers midi sequencing and the MPU-401 interface. If you still have a serial port on your machine and dos sequencer programs, this book might help describe how to get a midi sequencer working on a old pc. Midi sequencers never need more than a basic computer to work, even some had used Commodore 64's for sequencing and composition. It's when you sample sound that a faster computer is needed."
4,Nice,"Just as expected. Attractive good journal made in Turkey, very close to 128 pages (256 if you count both sides of page like some do). Good Eccolo product, nice combination of portability and lots of writing space. Not refillable."
3,Decent,"Nice for the price. The binding is such that the book is a bit difficult to keep open while writing in it; given it's smaller size, this can really make it a bit of a bear to work with.The cover is quite beautiful - definitely the best part of the whole package.I bought it to write notes in from meetings at work. It just seems a little classier and more professional to show up with a bound notebook rather than a pad of paper."
5,Black Lether Journal,I love this journal it's just the right size for me and excatly what I needed for the purpose that I order it for.
5,One of the best percussionists in the World !,"Paulinho's name appears in hundreds and hundreds of albums of all kinds and with a huge reason, his skills and performances are requested everywhere. Regardless of his tight schedule, he's also managed himself to record about four albums of his own; this one is absolutely fantastic, with Disco and Brazilian Jazz flavors. The best cuts are: Dreamflow, Carnival of Colors and Happy People."
3,wow christian videos,when i looking for christian videos or cds i want to know the artist .you know what song are on it so i know what im going to get.
4,An Essential Tool for Understanding Naifuanchi,"Although I do not necessarily agree with all of the author's assessments, especially in the history sections, this publication is, nonetheless, well presented. The sections on anatomy were well presented, and essential reading for instructors who wish to teach their students the mechanics of the predetermined responses that a certain technique will produce in an opponent. The applications are also interesting, and no doubt effective, especially in light of the ""science fiction"" that passes as kata bunkai these days. Although the author follows a different approach to kata application than I do, this book nonetheless will provide invaluable insights into this seemingly simple kata. All in all, I would reccomend this book to all who strive to understand the practical application of the kata of karatedo."
5,My favorite Judge Dee mystery,"When Judge Dee, on horseback, tired and soaked through, arrives at Riverton one rainy evening, he has to rub his eyes, for he believes for a moment that he has run into his double. But no, he is only looking at a harmless old hermit, riding a donkey. Blame it on the dusk.What else does a mystery lover need? A beautiful princess in distress, the Emperor's guilty secret, youthful love, court intrigue, mobsters, gruesome murders, and water, water everywhere: the rain, the river, the canals that run through the summer palace, the malodorous moats that surround it.And what about the hermit? Oh, he was the mystery, and the solution to the mystery. He was no one really..."
2,Not For Me,"I found this book rather dull perhaps because I generally dislike ""period"" mysteries. A few clever paragraphs to be sure, but in between these were alot of somewhat stereotypical characterizations and forgettable dialogue. Those who enjoy period pieces and all their assumptions and artificiality may like this novel but I did not."
5,Very handy,I usually have a hard time flipping a grilled cheese sandwich while keeping the bread from separating from the cheese when it hasn't melted yet. This spatula is amazing. I use it for grilled cheese and french toast mostly. It's a really helpful kitchen tool!
4,Great Duo Music by two masters.,"I've enjoyed the Clark Terry/ Peterson Trio album for years, when I found this Duet recording. Its just the two great players having fun and SWINGING! Terry rises to the challenge of keeping up with Oscar, one of the most technically gifted players of all time. Terry has a great sense of humor in his playing and even does some of his patented ""Mumbling"". Great Fun."
5,Clark Terry Rocks,"What's not to like with this album? Peterson & Terry share a brain here. Their interaction is seamless. Better yet, you can tell they are having a lot of fun making this music."
5,"Morgan and Gervase, sittin in a tree","Slightly tempted? Puh-leeze. I would say that these two were far more than simply tempted. They were tantalizing with their very French waltzes, stolen kisses, embraces in the moonlight. Who knew Brussels at wartime held so much sexual tension? A sweet and saucy tale of two very different personalities, coming together to make a perfect pair. And the ending? How can Ms. Balogh leave her readers hanging that way without remorse? Oh- she KNEW we'd have to go out and get the next in the series!"
4,"Love the People, Love the Book","The heart of a romance is character, and Balogh is gifted at presenting that. Morgan is particularly attractive and believable, aside from a brief episode towards the end of the book where her innate nobility seems to be shunted for a somewhat contrived plot point. Still, Morgan and Gervase are compelling enough to forgive the departure. Their story is both uplifting and entertaining."
4,Another swoon-worthy Bedwyn,"Mary Balogh has created another swoon-worthy Bedwyn. Morgan's story has thrills and romance. Once again, the Duke plays a fascinating cameo role."
3,Least favorite Bedwyn book,"I am a massive fan of the Bedwyn books, but this book somehow just didn't do it for me. I liked parts of it, the part in Brussels around the battle of Waterloo and the appearances of the other Bedwyns. But as an avid romance reader the hero is very important to me and I found Gervase slightly forgettable with nothing to really distinguish him for me. Maybe if I had read this as a stand alone book I would of liked it better, but I read it as part of a marathon, all 6 books in order and I thought the other Bedwyn stories so much better."
3,3 1/2 stars,"My problem with the book was Morgan. She acts so mature in the other books. But in this one...she was a child. She really was. She threw tantrums, she didn't want to admit she loved Gervase - that's a whole issue in itself. Why did she keep resisting him? I never understood why she was ""punishing"" him. But I did like the end where she FINALLY says she trusts him. It wasn't wrapped up too quickly like some authors would have done."
3,Typical Mary Balough Romance,"I find her writing so compelling until the end of the book nears. There is never a dramatic climax to the story. The characters simply decide they love one another, get married, and have a baby. I am a sucker for high drama and this ending disappointed me.I liked Gervase and thought the relationship with Morgan was believable and touching. However, as I already stated, I felt the ending was dull and not at all emotionally exciting."
2,Don't juge the series by this one,"I have really enjoyed the other novels in the Slightly series, but this one was dull. I liked Morgan well enough, but found little to like in Gervase. Maybe it was the ""cherie""s ad nauseum, but I kept hearing his voice in my head with a heavy French accent and rather feminine, so he never became a romantic hero to me. Oh, well, the other Slightly books make up for this one and I highly recommend them all."
1,"Not as good as the other TEMPTED series, at all","I have read 100 pages and am taking it back to the store! It was painful to even read this far! You meet the guy, supposedly a wastrel, banished from England, who has wasted 1/3 of his life! Then Morgan, well, we know she is terrific already. All of the sudden, after we know that Gervase (the guy) wants to use Morgan as revenge against her family- goes totally out of character and jumps in to help the British army. Morgan, who is stuck in Brussels, displays heroic attributes in nursing the wounded...and sees Gervase, also helping. Oh, now all of the sudden they are thinking noble thoughts about each other. What happened to the revenge need and the wastrel aspect of this guy? Too unbelievable. READ the previous four books that Balogh wrote. You'll be much happier and save your money on this one. Let's wait for Wulf's story; hopefully it will be better!"
2,Slightly long and drawn out,This is the first and last book I will read from this author. I couldn't get into it and I found myself skimming the pages until I finally had to replace it with another novel. It was a well written book but not the book for me. Maybe because I like humor and romance. I look to be uplifted from my reading material and this book failed on that score for me.
3,SLIGHTLY DISSAPOINTED...,"I HAVE LOVE ALL THE BEDWYN STORYES SO FAR, BUT THIS ONE IS SO SLOW THAT I AMOST PUT IT ASIDE. I THINK BECAUSE IS ABOUT MORGAN THE YOUNGEST AND HER STORY IS LIKE A JOURNEY TO HER MATURITY, BUT IT WAS A LITTLE BORING MOST OF THE TIME, AND A LITTLE DISASPOINTMENT FOR WHAT I EXPECTED."
3,Naami's Review,"I like Mary Balogh's books, but this one is totally predictable and for me, a dull tale. Perhaps some others in the series might be more interesting."
2,Blah,"I'm probably not the right person to write a review of this book since I haven't read any of the other, earlier books in the ""Slightly"" series. BUT, having said that, I always think any novel in a ""series"" should be able to stand on its own. This book bored me with a long winded, draggy plot. I did not find any of the characters involving, nor did it make me want to read any more of the series."
1,Vastly tepid,"Ms. Balogh used to write readable books, such as 'Lord Carew's Bride', 'Longing', etc. However, the mass production of the 'Slight...' series proves to be slight in quality or emotional intensity."
3,Better Than Others,"<Spoiler Alert> There is no ballet in this production. You would think that if a company was going to commit a production to DVD, that they would do a full length production. Unfortunately the ballets are often cut. In this case, only the La Chameuse portion is presented. I've never found that particular piece very interesting. The production itself is pleasant. However, I think they could have spared the viewers the behind the scenes set changes. Seeing the sets dismantled and reassembled only serves to destroy the momentum of the story itself. The time period itself is obscure. Its definately not Egypt in the 4th century, but more likely in the late 1800's, during the Ottoman rule. That said, it was a pleasant prodution and far superior to either of the other two currently available."
5,Thais by Massenet,"Thais was everything we'd hoped for, and more! It was exqusite! We loved it, and we highly recommend it to anyone who loves opera, and who loves Massenet. Then, who could ask for a more beautiful voice in the title role than Renee Fleming's. We give it five stars and two thumbs up!"
3,Story a little too heavy for me,"Not my kind of story. The entire cast is excellent, but the opera is not to my liking."
2,Not enough detail and seriously outdated,"I was excited about hearing about San Francisco, but ultimately disappointed in this DVD. While it did cover almost every part of the city, most places were given only one or two sentences and sometimes just video with no commentary at all. This DVD is WAY short on information and appears to be shot in the early 90's. Also, too much time was spent on tourist traps that are well known and not enough was shown about the wonderful neighborhoods of San Francisco. I was hoping for more."
1,does not work,"I LOVE the Carmen San Diego products, but we purchased several that seem to install correctly, then don't work at all. This one does not function beyond the start of the game. We are VERY sad & disappointed."
5,Perfect,Perfect for my boyfriend's chair. he had been looking for these for a long time. he missed his comfy chair. I knew that i would find them on amazon. he's is a happy camper.
2,$15 for four fabric wrapped rubber bands,"I didn't order these from Amazon, so this is not an evaluation of Amazon or their seller. I ordered these directly from TravelChair for exactly the same price, but I had to pay $8.41 for shipping! I got the replacement strings today. I can't believe these cost more than $1-2 to manufacture. There were no instructions, no link to a video showing me how to replace the strings. My strings only lasted two summers, then they rotted out and broke. The webbing is still doing OK, but if I have to change strings every two years at $15/chair, that's expensive maintenance. This looks like the same material used for bungee cords, so I'm going to look at some hardware stores and online for long strings of bungee cord material that I can use instead."
1,I wouldn't recommend this at all.,I debated if to buy this book for a long time. I wasn't sure about which books were in it. I don't consider even half of these books as great children's books.
4,"Filters out the particles, keeps the air more fresh!","I bought this because there are construction sites nearby causing a lot of notable particulate matter to build up on the windowsills and come into the house. Now, there is nothing building up on the window sill. The amount of garbage coating things in the house has dropped to just a normal coating of dust from the rug.It seems like nothing and is in a small roll, but it works quite well and does exactly what I wanted. I put actual filters in the other window but this is a more simple solution. I attached it to the window screen directly. You can do that with a needle and thread. you can easily cut it away when you don't need it."
5,WORKS WELL,Living above my brother's garage in a small apartment with an old furnace heating both areas caused concern about the air coming through the vent. Since using the filters there is less dust. I have also reused the filters by letting water flow through them until they are clean and then letting them hang dry.
4,Seeing a difference,I just installed these Thurs evening and I am already seeing benefits. Not having the intense allergy symptoms that I was having prior to installing the filters. I recommend them!
3,It's alright...,Placed and cut the large sheet into pieces and I must warn that it needs adhesive materials to place the sheets in place. Luckily I had some at home and was able to stick them on the vents. It might take a while for the house to heat up/cool with the sheets installed in the vents but it will be worth it if it does it job. Can't say yet as i just got them installed yesterday but overall it looks fine for now.
1,price to high,"The price was too high for the little amount you get.wanted to cover all vents in home, only 1/2 was covered"
2,It's just overpriced batting material...,"When I saw the photos, I really should have followed my first notion that I could get the exact same item from a fabric store or any place that sells sewing supplies. Sure enough: I paid almost $18.00 (with shipping) for the equivalent of a half yard of batting material (used in quilts) that sells for $3.00 a yard. Whatever special properties they might be claiming for this to be sold as a product used specifically for vents is hard for me to rationalize for the cost. I only wish that I had thought of marketing this myself and maybe I could retire early!"
1,Dirty - don't buy!!,"This product is supposed to filter out the dirt that comes through your vents - but the product arrived at my house already dirty. Instead of being white and clean, the roll is dingy; and, more disgustingly, the edge of the roll is covered with brown dust.The roll came in a sealed plastic bag, so there doesn't seem to be an excuse for it being so dirty.After having paid $5.75 in shipping on this product valued at $11.95, I'm not willing to spend (and lose) more money on shipping it back. Guess I'll just have to throw it away. I'm not a happy customer."
5,And the Oscar goes to...,"It's gonna get an Oscar if it were to be made into a movie! Itis quite a different gay novel out of those that I've read sofar. This focuses so much more on relationship and true love, unlike most others that focus almost entirely on ""loveless"" sex and about ""sleeping around"" being the virtue of being gay. Anyone has any ideas how to get the author to turn this beautiful, sincere masterpiece into a movie script?"
4,The reality of the dream.. .. ..,"Author Corlett takes his readers down a compelling - passion over-riding reason - road, made particularly poignant by a forbidden first love that is rekindled, some three decades later, with the discovery of a box of school memorabilia. Photographs therein confront Christopher Metcalfe with a face that has haunted him for so many years. The present and the past become one as the love-cocooned Chris agonizingly emerges from the time warp of his youthful passion to some painful revelations and metamorphosis."
5,A Poignant Tale,"The novel started off without much hint of its actual readibility and greatness. But soon enough, the reader will be inextricably drawn into the protagonist's life. To keep this 2 cents worth of review short, suffice to say that Corlett really plumbs the depths of gay love and obsession - revealing in turn the innocence, intensity and beauty of a man's love for another man. It can be somewhat bleak, but the landscape that Corlett paints is indeed breathtaking. Unflinchingly, he explores what it means to grow old, being alone, and yet holding on to a love that was kindled in the protagonist's tender teenage years. I sobbed reading this book. And it surely ranks among the best gay books I've read. Certainly deserving of being ranked with great writers like Monette, Leavitt and White."
4,Beautiful story of love and loss,"My heart absolutely went out to Chris in this book of love and loss. How many of us in our youth have felt the love for another that Chris felt for Stephen, and the utter sense of loss that comes if that love is betrayed. How heartbreaking, too, that Chris had no one to turn to, no one to help unfreeze his heart when he was young. The other characters, too, were believable, like Chris's mom, who found her biggest adjustment to widowhood was not living with loss, but living with freedom, and his sister, who just cannot leave things alone. (Don't we all have such an annoying relative lurking around!) I have to agree with a previous reviewer, though, who thought the ending played out too quickly, Chris's recovery coming too fast. 30 years of keeping your heart cold in order to protect yourself cannot be reversed in one weekend. I think more of a buildup, perhaps through a growing friendship with Hobbs, might have made Chris's catharsis more believable."
2,Lacks in power,It wouldn't break the lug nuts free - simply not enough power. Your money would be better spent buying a mid-size air compressor and an air impact wrench.It did do a good job of reinstalling the lug nuts.
2,"no power, seems like a drill","IT HAS NO POWER, CAN'T REMOVE MY CAR TIRE BOLTS- tire bolts is about 90 foot pounds. and thisimpact driver it suppose to have 340 foot pounds .where is the power?"
2,Buyer beware!,Buyer beware - this item DID NOT come with the hard case as pictured. Got a soft side bag instead. Shop around! I could have had it for $34 dollars cheaper without the case.
2,No Hard Box,This is a heavy duty tool. It is capable of being bounced around in a construction environment without a hard box but a box is a necessity for storage and stacking. The description and photo indicate a box but that is not how this product shows up. Bags are for homeowners not contractors!
1,Does not do the job.,Bought this impact wrench to remove lawn mower blades. Does not work. It comes with a soft bag rather than a hard storage case.
1,Best Left in the Can,"This sounds like very very early Heat. Most high school bands practicing their basic blues changes can probably do these chestnuts more convincingly. Not too much promise here of the great boogying and choogying to come, I'm afraid."
5,A great book on economic operations,"As a professor of aeronautical science in a large aviation oriented college program, I had been searching for a text which covered the economic aspects of airplane performance. The author does a wonderful job covering subjects such as the ""cost index"" and how it relates to economic climb and economic cruise conditions. The mathematics is very basic and should be understood by persons having taken algebra and perhaps introductory physics. This is the only text that I found that goes beyond the standard performance type topics in the direction of cost impact upon operations. The book would be excellent reading for aviation professionals or students of aviation. Great book!"
4,Good read for jet tranport,"Overall, this book does a great job explaining flight dynamics and associated cost. Even those without an extensive engineering background will be able to apreciate and learn from this book."
3,"Case OK, Belt clip useless","The case itself fits the phone snugly and helps recess the side buttons a bit, which helps avoid pressing them inadvertantly. It doesn't offer any protection for the LCD screen or camera lens other than recessing them slightly.The bad thing about this case is the belt clip. The part on the phone case is OK. A bit obtrusive, but better than most with this type of attaching mechanism. The bad part is the belt clip itself. The phone case doesn't securely attach to the belt clip and the belt clip doesn't securly attach to you. If you're looking for something with a good, secure belt clip, look elsewhere."
5,a must for jazz fans,"like its title, this album is really the one to listen to if you want to relax. joe henderson's version of my one and only love is simply beautiful and the rest of the album are just equally great."
3,Disappointed in colors of discs that arrived...,"The disc colors that arrived with this toy are extremely bland in colors of gray, orange and yellow...yucky and not much fun to look at! Haven't tried the toy with my grandson yet but I don't like the colors at all..."
3,"Fun, good value, a little finicky","It's a great little gun. Got it for my daughters, along with a refill pack. The mechanism that loads the next disc is a little finicky, though, and often gets jammed."
2,Not for 4 yr olds,Granddaughter has problem getting these disks to lay flat. If they are not flat will not come out. Very disappointing . May older kids???
4,Good book overall,Great scans of autographs. Nice layout. He lists everything from celebrity addresses to talent agencies!! A good book for begginers to collecting.
1,Poor recommendation,Sent for 4 autographs; one was returned deceased and two were returned for expired forwarding order.
2,Sci-Fi James Bond,"After the gritty realism (relatively speaking) of Robert Heinlein's ""Starship Troupers,"" ""The Puppet Masters"" was something of a disappointment. The story is not nearly as memorable, and the hero seems to have stepped out of a James Bond film. The old chauvanist James Bond, that is. Overall, I found the tone of the novel entirely too lighthearted to take seriously. And it is not remotely scary, which perhaps explains why the horror film of the same name was such a flop. Unlike the classic ""Starship Troupers,"" this is science fiction that has not aged well."
3,"good story, but I didn't like the style","This novel is one of the classics but I didn't find it as enjoyable as I thought I would. The story is relatively simple. A flying saucer full of aliens from one of saturn's moons lands in Iowa and proceeds to take over the population. These aliens are slug like creatures who attach themselves to humans taking over their bodies. They quickly multiply and threaten to take over the world. Getting rid of them is tricky because killing one while they are attached to a human will kill the human as well.The story's setting is in the 21st century. I found it comical how the author depicted the technology of today back then. Also, the dialogue seems awfully simplistic and I wasn't all that satisfied with how the author explained the creatures and how the scientists analyzed them.The story was fun, but not nearly as engaging as some of the Star Trek novels I've read."
4,delightful early science fiction..,"'The Puppet Masters' is a fun read that works off familiar territory: aliens invade Earth and inhabit the bodies and minds of humans. Robert Heinlein has a very smooth writing style which enables the reader to get into the story and not get weighed down by excessive details, as is often the case with science fiction novels. The author does a good job with characterizations and building suspense; at times 'The Puppet Masters' is a real page-turner.Unfortunately the book runs out of steam in the last hundred pages or so; it's as if Heinlein didn't know how to exactly pull the story together and build a satisfactory conclusion. While the end itself is good the author comes close to ruining it by added elements which seem totally contrived.Bottom line: overall a most worthy read, .. enough so for me to seek out other works by Heinlein."
4,ALIEN MIND CONTROL,"This is the first Heinlein novel I have read and I was pleased with my choice. This book is neither scary nor quick moving but it does make you stop and think about some of the things we have that are taken for granted. The idea of being controlled by a foreign body and losing all freedom can be a frightening thing. The idea that you would like the loss of control is even worse.In this book Sam Cavanaugh is a secret agent who with Mary and ""The Boss"" has to confront alien slug like creatures who hop on spinal cords to take control over that entities mind and body. In order for humankind to be saved, Sam has to have a coming of age and become the leader he is meant to be.This is a good book and you will enjoy being taken over for a while."
3,"Somewhat dated, decent story","This isn't the best Heinlein I have read (although I have only read about four or five of his works thus far) but this novel reeks of its age. Heinlein, understandably, could only be so correct in his prediction of the future, but the attitudes between people seemed right out of the 1940s or 50s (when the novel was originally written). If you like Heinlein, it's worth reading, but I have read better."
4,A reminder that blind faith is not in itself a good thing,"A dated story? Yes, but one that can be related today. Alien invasion or commies or the fact the invasion may come from a group within your own kind when motivated by an ouside force. I have been reading Heinlein for 30 yrs and I can say that this is far above the Sci-Fi of the time and although not one of his best. ( I leave that place for "" The Moon is a Harsh Mistress"") it is easy the say that it should be palced near the top. I have been collecting his works for years and can be safe in saying that if you want to really know the mans motivations, and some of his background. You must read REQUEIM."
2,Not for Sci-fi lovers,"These extraterrestrial slugs have made a mess of a good and intense action. I waited something to happen after the first half of the story, but easy-going action was smoothly running until the end. Although there are some excellent suspense scenes, in the end whole story becomes boring. Two stars for the action, zero for the sci-fi."
4,Solid indie rock at its finest....,"This is one of those albums where you can just press play and 12 tracks later after a day of work you realize that;a) These guys are harmlessb) Their tracks have a great indie feel to themc) ...it will grow on you after a few listens to.Besides the last track ""Stop/Start"", nothing really grabbed my attention, but it's defintely a great listen."
4,danger by design,"There is a lot to like about this installment in the Nancy Drew series: great graphics, good puzzles, lots of ground to explore. There are also some problems. I agree with other reviewers who complain about the lack of interaction with the characters. After about half the game is done, there is no significant dialogue with any of the characters. Also, the historical mystery on which the story centers has absolutely nothing to do with the strange incidents in Minette's studio that Nancy has been enlisted to investigate. These are solved by pure happenstance, which is somewhat disconcerting.Personally, I thought the confrontation with the villain at the end was hysterical. I loved it.Overall, I would recommend this game, but perhaps not to those with no Nancy Drew experience."
3,Felt Unfinished.,"I love the Nancy Drew Computer game series. I have played every other one out there. I was extremely excited about this new addition. It wasn't horrible. It just didn't feel as if herinteractive really finished their idea. They put so much into the very challenging puzzles that the story line and character interaction seemed very weak. I felt as if the characters were so uninvolved. It also ended very abrubptly. You didn't really solve the case. You just accidentally win. Also, the ending was very silly. I felt as if this game had so much potential, but Herinteractive did not use all of this potential. Of course, if you are the kind who has already played all the other games, I do recommend buying this one. I don't recommend this be the first Nancy Drew game you play."
1,"Dull, dreary and disasterous","I am a huge fan of the Nancy Drew games. This was an exception. For the first time ever, I actually gave up out of sheer boredom before solving this mystery. The colours are garish, the characters are dull, the storyline uninteresting, and tasks and puzzles are mundane. Fortunately Herinteractive didn't let this affect their other games. The only mystery here is why they lowered the bar so much."
3,"Good, but not the best...","Pros:Graphics were super!Interesting and fun puzzles.The confrontation with the culprit was great!Cons:Poor character development (esp. Heather and Jing Jing)Holes in the plot (what were those electrician books doing in the cupboard???)Not much sightseeing. I had hoped that Nancy would at least see the Eiffel Tower, or Notre Dame, or the Louvre. Instead she goes to a lame flea market and the drippy catacombs...I still like Last Train and Shadow Ranch the best!"
3,Not Nancy Drew's Best,"I was very excited when I heard that the newest Nancy Drew PC game would take place in Paris and yet, it didn't live up to my expectiations. The running errands and chains of ""if you do this for me then i'll give you..."" that always appear in these games were more tedious than any before and took up most of the game. Beside that I had trouble understanding the plot, many elements of the game were not explained (like why one character had electrical engeneering books), and the motive of the criminal was too far fetched to believe. Combined with the fact that the Parisian setting was not used to it's full potential, Danger by Design is a sign that Herinteractive is running out of ideas."
3,Not the best follow up but a good contender,"This Nancy Drew has a good plot idea but probably one of the easiest. The change in countries is great idea because all the others were in the states. It has some difficult challenges but not as much suspense as previous games.Most of the things she is required to do is run aroungd the city collecting things. There are not very many chances for Nancy to die or be sent home which is good and bad. It is bad because it is sometime funny to see her die but also it makes the game to easy because you cannot mess up. The ending does not really fit with the plot and the story did not build up in which then the ending would have fitted a little better. All in all, this game has some interesting innovations, such as the metro system and the case files of previous cases."
4,This game is Great!! (Few Problems though),"I received this game about a week ago, I had a few quarks when installing it but finally got it up and running correctly. I did however manage to break Disc 2 when removing it from it's case, I'll admit I was excited and I pulled it out by the edges without pressing the little ""Press here"" button like they have listed on their website. I called Her Interactive, and spoke to a gentleman in Tech Support who was very nice and helpful - he sent me a new disc free of charge! I wish all companies could be this helpful when it comes to this type of stuff."
4,Nancy Drew Danger by Design,This new Nancy Drew game was fun to play! It was shipped on time and arrived in good condition.
3,I wish there was more to the ending,"After about 10 tries, I finally beat the game in close to 5 hours. It would've taken me a lot longer if I didn't use the online walkthrough/cheats. The ending of the game, where Minette fainted after trying to fight with Nancy, THAT was a pretty good part of the game. However, I wish that we could've played the part where Nancy takes the dress to the police and tells the police all about Minette's dealings with those two German men, one is named Gunther and I can't remember what the others' name was. Nancy was also supposed to call Lynn Manrique and tell her that she found the stained glass stuff that Noisette had hidden. When Nancy talked to Lynn Manrique the second time, she told Lynn that she would call her again if she found the stuff that Noisette hid. We never actually get to play that part of the game either. I wish it didn't end before we were able to play it THAT way. It made the game seem like it was unfinished and put together too quickly."
3,Good and Addicting,"JUst wanted to say that I bought this as a gift for my sister. She requested it because she loves these kind of games. It's like being an investigator, trying to figure out every little detail. She is 15 years old and got addicted. I dropped it off with her on a Thursday and by Saturday morning I had a message on my phone from her that said she had beat the game. She spent a lot of time and effort on it but now the fun is over. I say it's probably a great purchase but don't do it all in one sitting. Take your time and enjoy the game. I would also recommend the other games Nancy Drew has to offer. Thanks and happy purchasing!"
5,One of the besy Nancy Drew games!,I was anxiously awaiting this game and it held up to expectations. I love playing Nancy Drew.
4,Danger by design an ok ND game,"this game takes place in paris(france) You are working under cover for fashion designer,Minnet as nancy drew. This game is real easy to beat(for me) The ending was NOTHING like I expected.(and kind of STUPID) The point of this game is to find out why minnet wares a full face white mask. But you really don't have much to do in this game that has to do with fashion(1 activity and that's IT) You're mostly running errends for minnet. Well hope you like my review. And enjoy this ND game"
5,Fun and mind boggling!,"The Nancy Drew series have always been great. Although not one of the best, this game was both challenging and fun. This game only lacked a bit of a story. I was very suprised when the game ended. I was like, ""That's it?"" It wasn't one of the better ones, but it is definately worth the money."
4,Danger by Design: Fun but LONG,"I am almost 13 years old and i have played some of the ND games. In my opinion, this game was one of the longest I have played. I have only played four of them, Message a Haunted Mansion, this one, Treasure in the Royal Tower, and the Final Scene.In this mystery, you have to make many trips back and fourth. When you first start, there are many names you need to remember or things become very difficult. Although it was long, I had a lot of fun. There are many puzzles and games. You even get to disarm a bomb.The end of the mystery has a big twist that shocked me. So if you have the time to play this one, I would recommend it. But if u don't, you will have a difficult time."
2,"How do I NOW play this game since I have WINDOWS 7? Many of my games are the same, I can't use them anymore, what to do?","I am just asking if the NANCY DREW games are going to come out with operating systems that can play on WINDOWS 7? I know some do, but most of my child's games are not playing on her new sony laptop, with Windows 7...what should we do, or what should the game maker's do for us?PLEASE EVERYONE THAT READS THIS, IF YOU HAVE THIS PROBLEM, PLEASE CONTACT THE MANUFACTOR LIKE I HAVE..NUMBER'S COUNT AS ALWAYS' THANK YOU.."
2,"disappointed, to many meaningless puzzles","I have been playing these games for a few years now, but I play them out of order. This was the least enjoyable for me yet. It contained so many meaningless puzzles that I totally lost track of what the storyline was. I often use the UHS hints to help me when I get really stuck, but this time I used them just to get the answers to the puzzles just to get through this game! I enjoy being able to question people, and in this game I'm not sure Nancy has one conversation with another person in the entire second half of the game. And it seemed like there weren't a lot of places to explore; only the kitchen at JJ's house, one desk at the office......I guess I just like a little more space. I was disappointed."
5,Best ND game yet!,"I have played a lot of ND games but this one is the best one yet! This game has everything. You have to make cookies, go scuba diving, develop photos, and explore an underground tunnel! As always the graphics are terrific and there are a lot of places to explore. The characters are great and you've got a lot of people to talk to. Some of the puzzles take a lot of thought but overall the game is fantastic! I highly recommend this game."
5,One of my favorites,"This Nancy Drew game was really good!! I have always wanted to go to Paris, and here is a Nancy Drew game set in France!! There is so much to do in this one, from making parfaits to learning martial arts. Who knew? It's really interesting to me, too, beacuse it has fashion design as a main theme. I loved playing this one. :)"
5,Not the best ND but it's up there.,"Hey, I'm 43 and I love ND games. This was a good one but not one of the best. Still, it was entertaining and the puzzles were pretty easy except for the total dark room. That requires sticky notes on your monitor. LOLStill took me 2 days to get through.I have every ND game, and out of all of them, I'd rate this on a scale from 1-10, about a 7-1/2."
2,Didn't like,I wish I would have downloaded a trial of this game before I bought it. I haven't gotten past the 1st part where you have to remember all the different kinds of teas for all the moods one of the characters has. It's too involved for me. I like to play these games to relax not to remember 100 things. I have purchased more hidden object games from Amazon that I do love to play but this isn't one of them.
4,GREAT series!,To me this is the best book of the Heart series. I loved the plot and felt sorry for both the hero and heroine. They both have their secrets and by the end you want to smash their heads together when you realize how foolish they both were in their misguided beliefs even if these beliefs allowed Michael to continue in his efforts as a spy for the crown. If I had to buy one of Candace Camps books in this series this would be the one!
2,Slow read,"I read the first 2 books, in this series, and LOVED them both. And even though I love the charactors in this book, the story was so slow, I found myself skipping pages just to finish the book. The story was a good idea, Michael and Rachel were great together as strangers, she should of kept playing with that story line, but it got to boring, with to much information and not enough story ...I completely lost interest half way, and couldnt get my interest back. I do love the first two books, if you bought this one before the other two..then go back and buy them, you wont be disappointed with them."
1,Redundant,&#65279;Readers of Candace Camp have been waiting for Rachel and Michael's story ever since they hadbeen introduced in So Wild a Heart. So it is understandable that I had high expectations for thisbook. Unfortunately I was sadly disappointed. The Hidden Heart turned out to be a very boringand redundant book. Rachel and Michael seem to be one dimensional characters who for sevenyears of marriage hardly speak to one another and suddenly one day she sees him differently andfalls in love with him. Now how believable is that? Also the book keeps repeating over and overthe same thoughts of the main characters. I had to force myself to finish this book and I have tosay this is one book I will never read again.
2,A rush job,This book has a clever plot and the first half of it has so much promise but then...it's as though someone else has taken over writing the book. The actual writing becomes amateurish and the unwinding of the plot is boring. I'm still a fan of Candace Camp and I hope the next book is better.
2,Disappointing and not very useful.,"The books by these authors do not provide any sort of useful information about what attractions their kids did and did not prefer, and why. There is no explanation of why certain attractions are even listed in the books, and which seem not to be very kid-oriented. Read my full review of Kids Love Indiana, and save your money."
3,"I like Woody's Movies, but...","I like a few of Woody Allen's movies so I thought I would like his plays as well. Not so fast. It took forever to finish but I didn't want to just stop, I like Woody for his movies and for who he is. I read the book while waiting at Doctor's offices or waiting for this and that. I read Riverside Drive on Amazon sample and bought the book.Riverside drive was sort of an Alfred Hitchcock movie, yet not as interesting. I predicted the outcome early on.Old Saybrook was aggravating. A pair of strangers stop by to look at their old house, get invited for BBQ and it gets weirder as you go.Central Park West was crazy and now I know what these plays were about, really. They are about the life of affluent New Yorkers by an affluent New Yorker and their society which looks great until you put on your glasses."
5,Great reading and excellent insight.,This book takes the reader into a historic journey of the economical tranformation in New York and the implications affected by exploring different immigrant groups. I particularly like the illustrated book cover. It captures the diversity of people and culture of El Barrio in New York.
5,Very Pleased,The book came within a few days of ordering and was in very good shape - like new. Highly recommend this source.
4,col317,"This is a wonderfully inspiring cookbook. My entire family has loved each dish that I have prepared. The recipes are easy to follow and the ingredients are familiar as well. The illustrations are beautiful and the ""grace notes"" are fun too."
2,The original title is more accurate-- THE TORMENT,"No ""possession"" in this film and the first 30 minutes are pretty good. However, you should NEVER show ""the evil thing""--that's why BLAIR WITCH and PARANORMAL ACTIVITY remain so successful/creepy--like them or not.And when men ""scream"" or ""cry out in terror"" it sounds pretty lame. Better to let the ladies be terrified or tormented."
4,Nice Bra,"When I was unable for several days, to order more of the Playtex Cross Your Heart #655 bra I ordered one of these at about 4.00 less. It is alright but not as comfortable as the #655 Playtex. I have now been able to order two more of that item. I will still wear this bra as it is very nice but is not as comfortable as the #655 Playtex."
5,Love these bras,I have worn these bras for many years and they are my favorite. I just don't wear any other ones.
3,Needs a new edition,"I'm not a professional poker dealer, but I read this book because I wanted to learn to deal correctly. Although I don't question the veracity of this book's content, the delivery was a big letdown. For example, the book's authors attempt to teach you how to pitch cards correctly without any illustrations or photos! This is pretty much impossible. You just can't learn how to shuffle, hold the deck, and deal without pictures.However, I can't find any other poker dealer handbook out there so I think this one's the best. If they were to release an updated edition of this book, I'd buy it in a heartbeat."
5,The Professional Poker Dealer's Handbook,"I have been in poker for 25 plus years working in Vegas, Mississippi and Calif. Opening a number of poker rooms as Poker room Mgr. I'm now a Poker Supervisor at Barona Casino in San Diego area. I've taught at dealers schools and now teaching poker dealing to a number of new folks just wanting to get into the businness. This is the best book I've ever seen or used to teach every aspect of poker dealing. I can not begin to tell you how much I use your book and refer to it. I give each and every new student a copy of your book. Thank You for making this book available to us.Thanks AgainBob Corona"
5,The start of a trend.,"An method from particle physics uses the concept of particle number in a recursive construction of Hilbert space; --the Hilbert space named after Vladimir Fock (a contemporary of Lev Landau and P.A.M. Dirac). But both math physics, and operator algebras, have pressing needs for an analogue this fundamental construction in a continuous context, as opposed to the familiar countable discrete framework. Some examples: semigroups of endomorphisms(quantum dynamics), continuous products(operator algebras), invariants(classification), and index(non-commutative geometry)...The Arveson memoir was the catalyst forthese developments in the 1990ties, and they are still active, as evidenced by math conferences on the subject."
2,Don't waste your money,"This book was a big waste of time and money. Aside from the usual ""tips"" that most of us already know (i.e. ""get a lot of sleep."") it contained no valuable information. It's a very misleading book, and does not prepare you for what is actually on the test. It focuses on a lot of parts of speech and literary terms that aren't even on the test. The diagnostic tests are a joke, they're nothing like the test itself. The only thing I got out of this book was a lot of undue stress. It covered all sorts of topics I never thought I would have to know, and I panicked when I did really bad on their diagnostic tests. As it turns out, I did just fine on the test, and all the things I stressed out about weren't even on it. Basically, you don't need this book. It's not endorsed by the college board, and it shows. It doen't aptly prepare you for what you'll face in the test itself."
4,Very high quality,I have a 24 inch head so I should have looked for a XXL. This company does not make one. Hat is a little tight. Also it is very warm. Not to be worn in the summer. Besides that it is extremely good quality. Looks awesome with a vest and some blue jeans.
5,just what we were looking for at just the right pricr,My husband has been wanting one of these hats for awhile. This one is nice and not to pricey. He is always getting compliments on it. As a matter of fact we just got back from camping and when my husband was out on a run in this hat a Guy riding a bike offered to trade my husband's hat for his helmet. Of course the anwser was no.
5,The hit of the parade,"Actually there's no parade, but it definitely is a hit. This hat is awesome. I wear it pretty much everyday at work and everyone loves it, including me. I've had many compliments on it. Once I put it on, I can't take it off. Mostly just to cover up the hat-hair I get from it, but I'm not complaining about that."
1,so sad :(,"Well the hat unfortunately looks fake, like for halloween and the money it's too much for the hat, i'm really disapointed , i think that i could wear it every day, but this is just halloween hat, like every celebrating plastic hat for birthday party, or something like that :( i'm just sad about it....."
2,A great book if you want a Bible lesson,"Fascinating concept. The story starts out like a thriller, but there are pages and pages of preaching about God's love. I'm all for a good Amen session, but this book is is an exercise in devotion. A great book if you want the Bible lesson, otherwise not so much."
4,"If you liked the movie, you'll love the book!","REVELATION was a great movie, so naturally I had to read the novellized version, and I'm glad I did. It really rocks, and it's hard to put down. Here everything's more fully developed, at the beginning, for example, Macalousso's followers and what they're like, that's more fully developed. I really love a good villain in a story like this, and aside from Macalousso, that cat Len Parker, man, he's a fascinating SOB. Here he's more fully developed, and we learn more about his background, especially that he's a lapsed Catholic. And that title, ""Overlord"" -- cool! And the character Cindy, well, here she's more soft and innocent, not cynical and sarcastic like she is in the movie. Here in the novel she even seems to be a believer! I really enjoyed it, and so will you. Bottom line: if you liked the movie, you'll like the book. Read it!"
5,Great gloves,Great gloves. Thick enough for no rose thorns and flexible enough to be like your hands. I will keep buying as needed.
2,Gloves not colorfast,Gloves bleed a nasty yellow color onto your hands if they get the least bit wet. Hard to get off. Don't use the die in the leather please.
1,Abridged-The Good Soldier Schweik,"Recently bought this CD and once again I have been snookered. Nowhere in the description can I find the fact that it is an abridged copy.They managed to 'abridge"" it down to 6 CDs and I always wonder what I am missing with such abridgements.I wish Amazon, or whomever is responsible, would pay more attention to this phenomenon and warn custmers what they are actually going to receive!Regards,LW"
1,The print is tiny--be forewarned.,"I will have to seek another edition of this classic, which comes highly recommended by friends. The print in this edition is so tiny (6 pt.?) that I couldn't imagine making it through hundreds of pages. I have okay eyesight, too. I am sorry to register this report as the book is nicely bound and set in Bembo, very handsome but way too small. I thought potential buyers should know if print size is important to them."
3,Warning about this edition. I want to give more stars!,"This is a difficult review because I love the stories and the translation is good overall, However: It seems like the Czech oaths and swears have been bawdlerized, although in the chapter in with Hungarians, the author has relented. There's a lot of old informal British terms used in dialogue, and I needed to look these up- some of these words might as well have remained in Czech. The text itself has German and Hungarian phrases which are usually (but not always!) translated in footnotes. On the other hand, Jalocová is repeatedly noted as juniper berry schnapps although context makes it obvious its a liquor. Basically, the translation needs more editing. I like Osudy dobrého vojáka vejka za sv'tové války enough that I might get another translation..."
5,A Job Well Done...,"I remember years back when Gail and Ken where in PSP and Gail said she was going to write a book.....Well Gail ""WELL DONE"" you are on the spot and tell it as it really is.JMMZChandler, Az. and still in the sky"
2,Decent Information but an English Language Disaster,"This book contains some useful information but the majority of it is far too shallow and fague. The writing within this book is a grammatical disaster. The author's writing style is convoluted, unneccessarily wordy and repetative. While this author may know a great deal about fish she is not a great (or even satisfactory writer). Anyone who has a slight sense of correct English or the fluidity of writing will get a headache from reading this."
3,Not for everyone,"Lots of information, but not all specific to what I wanted to learn or what I needed more detail to better understand."
1,Too Generic and Shallow,This book is too generic and lacks the most important thing which is practical advice. One can find some useful information how to start a tank but lots of other books and websites can tell you the same things. The authors did not address in deapth the most important aspects the fishes and their diseases. They tried to encompass a wide spectrum of questions but did it in a shallow way. The book does not tell you anything interesting about individual fishes and does not provide practical assistance in identifying and treating diseseas.
4,Work Purposed,I think that this is a great item to carry all my confidental papers along with my laptop!
5,Don't sleep on this album,"I must admit that I rediscovered Gene Ammons in my collection a few months ago. I had the CD Preaching for years and never even cracked it open until about 6 months ago. When I did play it I could not stop playing it as it watered my soul and caused me to revisit the church experiences in my life. There is no embellished playing here, just the sincerity of a man who had truly suffered in his own life. This was in my opinion more than a recording date, it had to be a recalling date as Gene Ammons had to tell his side of the story. This is a lights out no brainer people! This CD is so good I purchased numerous copies to give to folks who I thought could understand what Gene Ammons was talking about."
3,Excellent Tea but high price,"The pack I received had 2.75 written on the package in heavy read letters ( 2.75 is equivalent to about $4.50). Of course I felt cheated to have paid $9.30 for this.However, the tea is wonderfully flavorful and the pyramid bags are easy to use.My father-in-law who worked in the tea business for over 30 years vouches that this is one of the best teas he has ever tasted."
5,Refreshing Tea,"I and my wife love this tea. PG Tips is not easily obtained in many stores in USA, and I was happy to see on Amazon, and for correct price. This tea is really different. We put mint leaves and a tea bag for two small cups, and we also put honey. It smells great. On a evening, after a hard days work, to smell this hot tea, is relaxing. The taste is really great, we love this tea much better compared to other normal ones we see in stores. They claim that they make this tea from the tips of young leaves, and that really does make a difference. Highly recommended tea."
5,Puts Lipton to shame!,"It's official, I'll never go back to tea bags such as Lipton which are pathetic. Of course, the all time worst tea is McDonalds restaurant who have their own brand of tea. This tea has a much better taste than any other black tea I've ever had and brews nicely. The strength is two times that of the cheaper teas. I put one tea bag in a teapot of hot water and it serves two to three cups easily."
4,Good tea,"Good tea, but for a loyal tea drinker like me, need at least 2 bags per cup.Good flavor, satisfying drink. Like one reviewer pointed out earlier, there is a slightleathery after-taste after finishing the cup."
2,not worth the hype,"I've been a fierce fan of Harrogate's tea for many years, but I had read so many positive things about PG Tips that I had to give them a try. What a disappointment. Yes, packaging was fine, the product arrived quickly, and I suppose it was well-priced compared to what I might have paid in a fancy shop. But the taste was bleh, at best. I tried it plain, I tried it with milk, and then I gave the rest of the box away."
2,"cheap plastic switches,","The track was added to my grandson's set. One of the switches was immediately broken because it is made of thin, cheap plastic. I would not recommend this item unless the switches are improved."
1,Poor Quality Product,We purchased the Lionel-FT Outer Passing Loop Track Pack O to expand a new Lionel train set. When received one piece on one of the manal switchs was broken. In the past 2 weeks the other switching arm broke. Its design is terrible! The switching arms arm made of inferior plastic and are not reinforced. Any pressure breaks them. Lionel should redesign these products to make them more bullet proof and useable.
3,Outer Passing Loop,No problems with the track itself. The sign posts that insert into the mechanism that changes the track is very delicate and was broken on arrival. The seller replaced it for me with no problems.
5,Lionel Fastrack purchased thru Amazon,Lionel Fastrack is a great improvement over the original O or O27 guage track of the past. It is sturdy goes together well and the trains operate at a fast speed without derailing. Super for children 8 and up to learn about a great hobby. Amazon is very competitive with other suppliers especially if you have Prime shipping - rapid delivery.
1,disgusted with price!!1,"Is this author serious??? I mean $300 for a hair color book??? 191 pages. This is an outrage and she should be ashamedto call her self an author and teacher, trying to charge a student that much. ITS A BOOK!!! A BOOK! I have never seen sucha crazy price in my life. I will not be ripped off like that. For $300, that should come with a course and online telephone help.RIDICULOUS"
1,What a disappointment,This is the worst photo book I have ever bought. The printing and reproductions are awful - the essential text could have been fitted into a 20 p. booklet book and the photo examples suck. Getting away with this kind of publishing is almost like getting a way with murder. The folks recommending this book is actually getting people to buy the book under false pretence - shame on you! This book does not diserve the one stat rating!
5,excellent product,everything about this pencil is great. it closes to a perfect size to carry in your pocket. the snap is solid both ways. very unique too. the black coloring around the eraser has rubbed off. but i do carry it around in my pocket a lot. but the wear is honest. this is just a great looking accessory and i believe it could even turn into an heirloom.
5,phenomenal pencil,"The Pentel Kerry is a phenomenal pencil. I used one for 20 years when I owned a steel company. Somehow, it got lost and I have been searching for years, but did not know the name ""Kerry"" so when I was surfing on line today, I was thrilled to find it! It will be here in a few days, and I am very pleased. My dad introduced me to this fine writing instrument. What a joy to find again!"
5,One of a rare kind,"I have been using mechanical pens for more than 15 years, and have probably used more than 20 different types so far. This is one of the best so far.In short, it combines the touch of the high quality pens with the practicality of a pencil. If you like to use high quality pens & mechanical pencils, you will love this one."
4,Smooth writing pencil - frustrating eraser,"Writes smoothly, and is a great feeling pencil. Quality design and looks good.The only complaint is that compared to the PhD pencils, the erasers are very difficult to manage.The cap clicks into place easily and protects the lead and tip of the pencil. It travels well because of this and the profile. Though I prefer to use myPaper Mate PhD Mechanical Pencil, Retractable, 0.50 mm, Black Barrel (67004)when at my office."
3,Nice,"works fine, feels fine, it's fine but the cap and body is not the same color, everything else is ok"
5,"Cute, sexy, precise.","As a designer, I am obsessed with using the best tools to sketch and draw my mockups. This pencil is not only sleek looking, it actually does the job really well. It feels extremely sturdy, and will likely last me a very long time. The pencil holds the lead in place so that it doesn't break easily.I've already bought 2."
5,Best Mechanical Pencil,"I am a CPA and write with a mechanical pencil all day long, and the Pentel Kerry .5mm pencil is the best I have ever used."
4,"Great look and feel, bad eraser",This pencil looks great but like most mechanical pencils dont expect a great eraser. the eraser wiggles from side to side as you erase. If you dont mind using a separate eraser or have a electric eraser this is a great buy.
5,Had this since 1991!,"As of today, year 2010, I've had this pencil (.5mm version) for 19 years!I got this at a store, that's right, back when there was no amazon.The store is now closed and it was built by a company with just one name, not brought out by six different companies.Still works great. I still use it on occasion.Mine is emerald green."
3,It's too small,"I think this pencil is too small. It's about half an inch shorter than standard mechanical pencils and pens. It's also somewhat skinny. It's like a somewhat miniaturized pencil. I have large hands and I don't like this small size. It's a little weird. It might be OK if you have small hands. It looks OK and it works OK. I think this pencil is overpriced. It's nice but it shouldn't cost $18. The 0.7mm lead is a little too thick and the 0.5mm is too thin and scratchy. I think 0.6mm would be the perfect size, but nobody makes that. I think someone should make a 0.6mm mechanical pencil. Another bad thing about this pencil is that the textured metal part (silver colored) is too high on the pencil. It should be closer to the tip because that's where you put your fingers. It's stupid to put the grippy part ABOVE where you would put your fingers.. This pencil is poorly designed. Don't buy it. The best mechanical pencil is the Pentel Graph Gear 1000. I highly recommend that one."
1,false advertisement,The quality of the pen I received is what I expected from the Pentel Kerry no problem there. The problem is that based on the advertisement on the display I was ordering a .7mm blue Pentel Kerry. I got a .5 mm black pentel Kerry. I went back to the same advertisement and noticed that when you enter the order a screen flashes up showing the .5 mmm pencil. That's a cheap trick in my book. I will never order anything from these folks again. I'm surprised that Amazon would allow that kind of nonsense.
5,THEEE best mechanical pencil!,Very comfortable to write with and cap keeps point safe when stored in pocket or purse.
5,Best Mechanical pencil made,"You cans spend a lot more for a mechanical pencil, but few write, handle or last better than the Sharp Kerry. The removable cap speaks well to its longevity, and it offers a marvelous feel to the hand.Pencil freaks will want to try one."
3,pretty but slippery,"It's a pretty little pencil but for my needs a bit short, even with the cap put on the other hand and also slippery.I use pencils to edit copy, so need something I can hold comfortably for long periods of time.For intermittent use I guess it would be ok.The first one did not advance lead properly but the vendor was wonderful about replacement."
4,A good but not great value,"Length:: 1:32 MinsMaybe this was a case of too much hype and I don't think so. Perhaps its a case of ""They just don't build 'em like they used to? All the verbiage aside, just considering the product delivered for the price I paid, the value just isn't there. For $15 I was expecting something with a more substantial feel and even better build quality. It's somewhere between OK and good. Closer to good and definately not great. If I could have rated it 3.5 stars I would have. Maybe 3.75...I've tried to provide a fair showing in the attached video to help you with your buying decision. For me, I like it and use it but don't see buying any more, either for myself or as gifts for others."
3,"Great pencil, picture is misleading.","This pencil writes beautifully! It's got great weight and I can write so smoothly with it. However, my biggest complaint is the color. I ordered the blue version and in the picture it is shown as a vibrant metallic blue, but what I got was a very drab dark blue. It's not even metallic. That was one of the biggest reasons I ordered this particular pencil, so I am very disappointed with it. Had I known the true color, I would have simply ordered a black one. I am considering exchanging it since I really can't stand the color. The quality is still superb though, so I would recommend the pencil."
5,Great value for money. Functional and useful [see also other review,Functional and useful and a great value.
1,They didn't ship out brand new pencil,"I purchased this pencil because I lost my old Pentel Kerry at Library, and I really love it. But I was very disappointed when I received the package. There are major scratches on the cap of the pencil, which is very noticeable, and there is no receipt in the package, so I can't even return it. The worse is they call this a ""Brand New""..."
5,Best Engineering Mechanical Pencil Made,"I think the October 2011 video review is way off base! I have had several of these Pentel Kerrys for more years than I can remember! And I give them as treasured gifts. They are still available because they are robust, reliable, and well designed and engineered, just like the T-Ball Jotter by Parker and Cross products. I would pay $50.00 for one if I had to. They are not plastic like the video says; they are all metal, probably hard aluminum with a fine finish. They are well balanced, and they do not rattle like the video says. What he hears is the spare leads! I have been an engineer longer than I care to say, and although I have worn off the finish with use, never has one worn out, broke, or failed in any way. You cannot go wrong buying one. In fact buy several-who knows how long they will continue making them? I own six, with 0.5 and 0.7 mm leads."
4,Nice,"Good pencil for writing and it is good and it makes for a great wring tool, great gift idea yes"
4,Almost There!,"I've used Pentel 5 pencils for years, and I liked everything about them except that I constantly broke the 0.5mm lead while writing with them. This new Kerry with the 0.7mm lead solves that problem. Now if Pentel could just figure out a way to keep the eraser cover from coming off so easily, they would have the perfect automatic pencil!"
4,A good but not great value,"Length:: 1:32 MinsMaybe this was a case of too much hype and I don't think so. Perhaps its a case of ""They just don't build 'em like they used to? All the verbiage aside, just considering the product delivered for the price I paid, the value just isn't there. The lead rattles inside the pencil body and the balance, for me, it top heavy. The pencil wants to pivot off the page. For $15 I was expecting something with a more substantial feel and even better build quality. It's somewhere between OK and good. Closer to good and definitely not great. If I could have rated it 3.5 stars I would have. Maybe 3.75...Obviously there's a lot of subjectivity here and more people love this pencil than don't. In fact, my rating indicates a good value. However, from what I read prior to purchase I was expecting more and wanted to provide what I hope was a fair description so others who decide to buy it will be delighted with their purchase."
2,Not A Quality Product,"I expected a lot more from a $17 pencil. The metal cap is quite nice, but the plastic barrel looks terrible (a plastic sleeve poorly fitted over a plastic body with sloppy seams and joints). This pencil does not look like a quality product. I intended this to be a gift for my wife, but I would never give her something that looks this cheap."
4,"The Best of the Best, But Not Perfect","The Sharp Kerry is the best pencil that I've ever bought. It just feels right in your hand. At first, I was a bit worried that it would be a bit large since I have smaller hands, but that turn out to be a problem.Upon opening the box it came in, I grabbed the case and simply said, ""Wow.""I upgraded from a TwistErase III to my new Sharp Kerry and now I'll never go back. I just wish that the eraser was a bit more like the TwistErase, but I'll just grab a handheld one."
4,Good pencil,"I like this pencil because it's small, compact, light weight and looks good too; a bonus is that you don't have to worry about retracting the lead before putting it back in your pocket. My only complaint would be that it does not contain an eraser. Which means that you have to take one with you or wait until later to make your corrections. The fact that I can erase and make a correction is the primary reason that I carry a pencil (along with a pen) with me . Correct this and you'll have one excellent mechanical pencil."
4,Sharp Kerry pencil works well,"I agree with the other reviews that the mechanism for advancing and holding the lead works very well, and the pencil is attractive to the eye. I do find it a little inconvenient that you have to remove a little ""hat"" to use the eraser. In that sense, some of the less expensive pencils are simpler."
4,just ok,"gave it four because it is much better than standard mix in hot cocoa. this is a cocoa powder, but it does actually melt when you rub it between your fingers. One thing i did not expect/ particularly care for, is that it has a similar taste and texture to those found in the ""mexican"" isle in the grocey store like ""el abualita"" and ""ibbarra"", those ones are ok but i prefer a darker, and more natural taste like the hot chocolate from starbucks or other coffe shops."
3,Not real drinking chocolate,"It's called drinking chocolate, but really it's just cocoa with less added sugar. Drinking chocolate is thick, this does not thicken. 3 stars because it's pretty yummy regardless, but if you're hoping for actual drinking chocolate, just buy a package of baking chocolate and do it old school."
2,A Mish Mash of bland mixes!!!,Definately not even close the In the Mix 2 in terms of memorable tracks or good mixing. The album simply lacks life and goes weaker and weaker from CD 1 to CD 2. Not a single track stands out making this album good for nothing other than background music when nothing else is at hand. A real disappointment.
4,"good, and has the classic atb cheese","The track selection is very good, the order of them is very well thought out. Atb has talent, and also this bit of cheese about him. Both are shown with this cd. If you like vocals, you'll definitely like this cd."
3,Not his best mix,"I love love love!! ATB but this is really not his best DJ Mix... I am missing DJ Mix 4 and 6, hopefully those are better.. the rest of all of his DJ Mix and CD's are wonderful!!."
5,quality mix,"this is a quality mix, great tracks and great mixing. im a big ATB fan lately. if you like this, check out nightmusic vol 1 + 2, anjunabeats (whole series), and global underground 028, 030, 024 (nick warren)...cool stuff"
5,"A great wiper, finally!!!","Not only does the Bosch Icon wiper do the job, it does it well, and quietly! After spending more money last year for a different set of ""premium"" wipers, I thought the more I spent, the better. Not necessarily. Those were excellent wipers as far as clearing the windshield but they were so noisy, we hated using them! I finally broke down and decided to try these Bosch Icons since they're rated to be quieter than most and high quality. They are slightly more expensive than cheaper brands at your local department store, but if you buy them from Amazon, you'll be quite pleased with the value, quality and the quiet operation - now we don't even hear that they're on!"
2,Not worth the premium price,"2007 Honda Odyssey in Syracuse, NY. I bought these when they were on sale and I had a rebate which ultimately made them 2-for-1 cost. At full price, I would have been resoundingly disappointed. The driver side wiper never makes complete contact with the windshield at slower speeds. From what I have read in hindsight, this is not uncommon. Would definitely buy the less expensive wiper blades and save the premium price."
1,Worst Wipers EVER,Bought these because I've always had good luck with Bosch wipers. These are simply horrible. They streak badly and sometimes will have huge swaths it won't wipe properly. I'd suggest going with Bosch's supposedly lower quality Micro Edge blades. They work much better than these Icons.
2,Cant use them on windy days!!,"I cant believe i actually spent big bucks on these things.I used them for about a week and took them off.They do clean the windshield well when there isnt any wind but the slightest bit of wind will pick these blades up off your windshield and they wont clean a darn thing.The problem with these blades is that since they are not like conventional blades that have sections with small arms on them pushing the blades against the windshield,the Icons are a closed design(kinda like winter blades) in where air cannot pass through them causing the air from driving down the road to lift the blade off the window and causing no pressure to the windshield itself.If you only drive under 35mph,these blades would be fine,but who only does under 35mph?I went out and bought Rain-X Weather Beaters which are cheap and they work awesome!"
4,Great wipers,"These wipers are more expensive than what I would normally get but I had a B1G1 offer so I tried them out. For comparison, I previously used the regular Rain-X brand wipers which worked fine for a while but never seemed to last more than 6-8 months for me. I got them almost a year ago and they are still working great. I would recommend them even if you have to pay the full price for them because they will probably end up lasting a lot longer and not need to be replaced nearly as often."
5,I CAN'T SPEAK HIGHLY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS DVD,"I can't speak highly enough about this DVD. I would recommend it very highly to anyone who, like myself, is klutzy and always has been all the way to someone who has a pretty advanced stage of Parkinson's disease. A close friend of mine does. I bought a copy for him and he is benefitting from it already! Yes the exercises SEEM too easy to really work when you first do them the first time but that's the amazing part of it. It works and works well! I had pulled muscles in both legs and getting out of my couch was a nightmare for fear of pulling them again (even though it had been a long time since I pulled them). Still within a WEEK of doing these exercises I was able to get off the couch without any problem! A lot less expensive and of course no hassle as compared to physical therapists."
5,"great program, even better support","having purchased a dazzle product a few years ago and being very much burned by the experience, I wasnt sure about VCP, until I tried it. Very easy to key (get that ""weatherman"" effect with interchangable backgrounds), powerful tools that allow you to create (IMHO) professional grade video, simple to use out the box and very easy to understand for novices like myself, I am VERY glad that I purchased this."
4,A good read,"Tim Sharman presents a contemporary photograph of the country I call home. From the czars of the past, to the modern day presidents, this work is thorough and to the point. It is a wonderful all encompassed minibiography that does not bore the reader with minute details. I further recommend James Michener's Pilgrimage: A Memoir of Poland and Rome."
4,SACRED HELIX GREAT READING,"Marty (ohi8u2@aol.com), avid reader., October 30, 2000, Absolutely Stunning! Thought Provacative and Intriguing.g Cloning in of itself is fascinating, but to attempt to clone Jesus Christ is absolutely mind boggling. I could not put the book down the more that I got into it. This book mixes Science, Religion, Politics and man's drive to understanding himself. I'd recommend this book to anyone. The ending was both Shocking and Moving."
2,Head doesn't stand up,"I was disappointed by this product, because the head would not stand up and it made my child not want to wear. I did everything to mend the problem and nothing worked."
2,"excellent idea, terrible value",Putting value in perspective this thing just isn't worth it. Not to mention someone can easily steal this off of your hitch if you don't have or purchase an additional locking pin. I returned it.
4,So far so good!,"I have a 2001 Toyota Tacoma with an after market Draw-Tite HiddenHitch. The HitchSafe fit without issue, the cover fits securely and all needed keys fit inside with room left over. I cut a piece of foam to put over keys to avoid any rattling...worked perfect. I spend a lot of winter weekends in the snow, and for me that will be the real test. I will update this post to reflect how it held up."
5,Perfect For Hidden Key,"We have a car at the condo where we visit once a month or so. Before this product, we were always having to remember to bring the extra set of keys when we left home for the airport. Now, we have an extra car ignition key and condo key in the trailer hitch safe. It works great. Looking from the outside, you would never know there is anything behind the rubber hitch cap. The 4 digit combo lock works smoothly, and has a nice sized compartment for the extra keys. If you need to keep a set of keys hidden, this is highly recommended."
4,good fit,I installed this on a Draw-Tite receiver with no problems. It comes with enough foam spacers to adjust the depth so the holes line up to the retaining pins. The rubber cover seems to fit well. I put my spare key in a zip lock bag because I don't see how you could possible keep moisture out of the vault box. It is well made but I think the price is a little on the steep side.
2,Good concept but has it's quirks.,"Works well if you never need to remove to use your hitch very often. Water leaks into compartment,might rust over wet season. Extremely overpriced. Availability of replacement (and cost) of rubber cover unknown. When they tweak the design and lower the price to $29.99 it will sell like hotcakes."
1,Make sure your hitch's receiver hole is drilled close enough to the mouth of the receiver.,"As the tile states. The hole in which my pins install is too far back for this contraption to fit in. That was very annoying, the company needs to state (maybe they do and I did not read) how far the pin hole can sit from the opening. Make sure the (front of the) hole for the pins is less than 2&1/4"" from the outside of the lip of your hitch opening, mine was about 2&1/2"" which made this unit not fit. Any thing greater than 2&1/4 means it will not fit. The company should drill the back hole 3"" and then also include a larger 1/2"" spacer for these kinds of trucks. Sorry if there are typos, I am doing this review from my phone."
1,Toyota Tundra requires extra long pins,"The extra long pins required for installation on a Toyota Tundra are not provided with the HitchSafe, must be ordered at an additional coat.That information should be included with with the product information. The unit is overpriced plus two additional pins for $9.95 is a total rip off."
2,why the extra charge ???????,i own a toyota tacoma why do i have to pay extra( 9.99) for the pins that fit my truck ?????? doesn't seem fair those pins should be included. other than that seems like a well made product a little expensive.
5,Great product,Great product!!! This is the perfect gift for a surfer! I also have a spare one that I haven't used yet. I will be willing to sell for $50 if anyone is interested. Send me an email at pnuuge@gmail.com for more info.
1,OVERPRICED!!!!,"I saw this thing locally for about $30. Thought it was a good idea, but figured I'd get it for about $20 on Amazon. The point is, shop elsewhere."
3,Unusual use for your hitch.,"The product arrived in good shape. Well made and installation was easy. Not impressed with the cover the fit was not secure and it got lost in a short period of time. Ordered another one for nine dollars plus. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5."
3,The Chrome Nubs Rust :-(,"It's a great idea and a lifesaver for someone always locking themself out of their car and house, but per title, the chrome plated nubs which hold the hitchsafe secure rust very quickly (my home town does not use salt of the roads). Were it not for the rusty nubs, this product would be perfect..."
3,"MICHAEL ROWE, OPUS ONE","I really like how Michael Rowe describes the solitude of the megalopolises by following 29 days of the life of Laura in her room. The second main theme, the couple death and sex, is a more classic theme perfectly used here. Two Mexican Ariel awards (Best Actress and Best First Work). Recommended."
3,My review,"I believe this is good movie not a great movie. I like how the movie used only two locations, it showed the loneliness felt by the main characters."
2,"Beautiful voice, disappointing music","Having heard Little Willie G do vocals for Los Lobos on The Ride, remembering Malo and Thee Midniters from the past, I was expecting a rocking CD. While he has a beautiful tone to his voice, most of the music on this CD seems like schmaltzy 80's smooth pop. Just not interesting from a guy who got his start rockin' in East LA."
4,This off-beat spy movie is an overlooked gem.,"This off-beat spy movie starring a pre-Rockford James Garner is an almost forgotten, overlooked gem. The movie co-stars George Kennedy and Eva Renzi and centers on the search for lost diamonds in South America. Garner is a fashion photographer sent to South America to do a shoot with model Renzi featuring a new lipstick, ""Pink Jungle"". They get involved with Kennedy and a variety of other characters looking for lost diamonds. The whole time, Garner is accused by the local police of being a CIA spy. The movie is funny and charming with Kennedy practically stealing the show. Although the movie is more than 30 years old now, it holds up well. If you are looking for some light hearted entertainment with some good performances, check this one out. You will not be disappointed."
2,cheap quality,"the key chain was pretty cheaply made, and it does not look like the picture. Although the design does match the one in the picture, the one I received was yellowed and old looking, as if it had been sitting in a warehouse for years."
4,Cooking Encyclopedia,"This book has great illustrations on an wide assortment of ingredients. With great pictures it goes into detail about the hows of cooking, storing and the taste and texture of the items discussed. It also discusses the differences in varieties and purchasing. It is broken down into 12 different sections 1)Eggs and dairy, 2)Cheese, 3)Fish and shell fish, 4)meat/poultry and game, 5) Vegetables, 6)Beans, lentils, peas and grains, 7)Pasta, noodles and wrappers, 8)fruits, nuts and seeds, 9)herbs and spices, 10)condiments, flavorings and oils, 11)tea, coffee, chocolate and sweeteners, 12) equipment. I highly recommend this book for the food enthusiast or for people that just want learn and have a better understanding about the food that is around us. I had purchased this book before and lost my copy I was glad to see I found it on amazon. I only wish this book had the health benefits for the body included in its descriptions. I hope this review helps."
4,Great disc set!,"Both blue ray movies on the same disc and two separate discs for the DVDs allows us to have the movie in multiple places. Also let the family move right on from the original to the sequel. Great story, characters and family friendly movie!"
5,worth watching,Great family movies. Good story line with enought comedy to show what happens in real life. second movie give a look into what might happen in a royal family.
4,great for girls movie night,This is a light hearted set perfect for girls night at the movies. Julie Andrews is wonderful as the queen and the unlikely princess is absolutely spot on as a nerdy teenager .
5,Julie and Anne,Yes... I am a guy.No.... I am not gay.Yes... I love both of these. So what?Watch and fall in love with Anne.
3,This movie is an insult to the book series!,"This is a good movie, but it is not similar to the book series. For those of us who read the novels, then watched the movies, most of us were disappointed. It is a good movie and they did a good job, just I'm upset because they changed everything from the book including they eliminated characters and events. They should remake this series."
1,Worst Poker movie ever!,This movie blows! The only good part in the entire movie is Shannon Elizabeth's 5 minutes of fame. If you love poker and texas hold 'em movies then don't watch this one! If you want two good ones to watch then definitely check outRounders (Collector's Edition)orLucky YouRounders is a really great Poker movie and Lucky You is a good 2nd place finish. Don't waste your money on Deal!
4,"Fun, Fun, Fun...Till Daddy Took the Girl Away","Great fun for card players and solid acting makes this an enjoyable movie. It's all about risk...love...and trust. The plot is predictable as it unfolds, but this flick hits the mark. Bret Harrison and Burt Reynolds hold this film together. The rookie and his mentor square off in the world of gambling and within the world of reality. Shannon Elizabeth's brief but poignant role glues the storyline together. Four stars for the pure entertainment value."
2,Compare to Rounders?,"First I'd just like to say that Mr. Charles Durning is a cast member on this movie.I think Mr. Charles Durning is a tremendously talented actor who incidentally has led a most interesting and adventurous life.His Mr. Healey in Captains and Kings was incredible! Now,to the movie. Comparing Deal to Rounders is like comparing apair of roller skates to a Rolls Royce because they're both vehicles. The cast seemed to try but it just didn't work."
2,2 stars for 2 minutes of Shannon Elizabeth,"Yup. I gave one star each for each minute of Shannon Elizabeth's screen time. Otherwise it would have been zero stars! Basically ""Color of Money"" remake with tired old poker clichés."
2,Sending the wrong message,"Someone has to point out that the moral of this story is: ""Don't go to work. Go play poker and you'd make millions (easily; almost everybody does)"". Or: ""Playing professional poker is a productive contribution to society"". Or: ""If you show them you bring enough money, your parents will forget their plans for your future and support you"".There is a minor lateral message: ""Prostitution is ok, as long as you tell your customer that you are a pro, so he does not fall in love with you. The problem lies in lying, not in prostitution itself"".I cannot imagine what kind of influence could this movie have on impressionable kids.It is entertaining all right (one star goes for that), but it certainly cannot be ""very very good"". After all, it features Burt Reynolds, an actor with a long career of making bad, irrelevant, white-trash movies."
1,This book is not for every child!,"We bought this book with high hopes that it would help our two and half year-old daughter sleep through the night. We got her ready for bed and started to read the story. However by the end of the book she was quivering and started to cry saying ""no sleep fairy, no present!"". I think the thought of some strange thing coming into her room at night was just too much for her. Too bad because the illustrations are nice and the sentiments are sweet. This might be a better book for someone a little bit older."
1,Not what I had hoped,"This book uses gifts to keep kids in bed. It is only a step away from bribing. (it's not the parents giving the gift it's the fairy). After reading it to our 4 year old, we explained that no one was going to be leaving a toy under his pillow if he doesn't come out. We also told him he is expected to stay in bed anyway. As a parent I am not going to give him a toy for something I expect him to do. This book does not work for our family. Very few books are removed from his book shelf, and this is one of them."
2,Wish I would have read more reviews,I read the first few reviews & got really excited about this book... but I didn't realize that the sleep fairy leaves a present every night under the pillow. I had to return it because we simply didn't want to go down that road - we have enough 'stuff'. It would have been much better for the sleep fairy to perhaps leave a quarter or something like that under the pillow that can just be added to the piggy bank each morning LOL. We bought The Sleep Fairy audio CD at the same time & that has been working like a charm for my 2 year old & 4 year old.
5,Great book!,"My son is 4 and has a habit of getting out of bed 5 times for water, potty, kisses, whatever he can think of. This book works great at keeping him in the bed on the first try!!"
5,sleeping solutions,"Our kids refused to sleep but the sleep fairy did help. They're older now but still talk about ""when the sleep fairy will come back."""
3,too old for two,"The book is very well written and beautifully illustrated, however my 2 year old wants nothing to do with it. Either it's too old of a read for her or she's smarter than the average bear!"
5,It's a miracle!,"This book is amazing. I have two children ages 5 and 2 1/2. My 5 year old normally goes to bed by himself but calls down to us 3-5 times a night wanting something more to drink or another hug and kiss or whatever. And my 2 1/2 old has never gone to sleep without me sitting beside her. Well those days are gone! I read the book to them, answered a few questions about the sleep fairy and then stepped out of the room and shut the door. My Husband and I waited to hear them cry out for us but not a peep came out of the room until the next morning when they woke up. They immediately felt under their pillows and found that the sleep fairy did come to their room last night. They were so excited it was like Christmas morning all over again. My Husband and I are shocked and SOOOOO happy. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!!"
5,Great book!,"This book is a great find. It's not 100% working JUST yet and I'm not CRAZY about giving little gifts every day but it does seem to be working. I've been stocking up on dollar store finds, etc. and my daughter is so excited in the morning to see the Sleep Fairy had visited. Cute book and hopefully she'll be sleeping in her own bed, every night, very soon!"
5,Ron's voice is rare and wonderful,Love this music. It can change you -- in the most positive ways! Thank you!
5,Wonderful cutaway drawings,"If you enjoy cutaway drawings this is a book to get. It is absolutely full of extremely well done cutaway drawings that do a great job of explaining the concepts being presented. While the text accompanying the drawings is quite good, you could get 90% of the information presented by only looking at the illustrations. It is also a great book to pick up and open to any arbitrary page to browse. You will inevitably learn something you didn't know on almost every page."
3,I've,never had time to watch it yet. I was hoping to be able to buy it and download it to my computer.
5,Spare Tire,Wheel seems high quality and matches the two on my trailer perfectly. Im using it as a spare so not sure how it rolls down the road.
3,Testing theories on Easter Island,"As there isn't much but oral tradition left to tell us about Easter Island, people have often wondered: how did they move those big statues around? This program attempts to explain this oft-asked question.Several engineers and scientists who have studied how other cultures have transported heavy items convene on Easter Island to test their theories; some work, and some don't. Tempers flare and conversation gets heated as each seems to think of his or her own theory as best. In the end, they settle on a few workable but time-consuming methods. Was this how the island natives moved the stone? We may never know, but it was interesting to see nonetheless.Three stars."
4,"Bible-based look at ""near death"" experiences","A fascinating, Bible-based look at life after death and the true meaning of the much-publicized ""near death"" experiences. By presenting the very latest scientific, philosophical, anthropological, ethical, and theological evidence on the topic, the authors confirm the timeless truth and validity of the Bible's teachings about life after death."
4,Fresno's Finest,"Snake Eyes is a great rap cd. Killa Tay has a style that is unlike anthing you've ever heard. In this day of mcs that either sound the same, or do the same thing that others have already done, it is always nice to hear someone come with some originality. Tays got a crazy rhyme style that sounds perfect over the hard West Coast beats and smooth tracks. It is a whole new sound in rap. There is a very distinct sound created by the background vocals that are laced in and out of Tay's rhymes. As soon as you hear it, you'll know what I mean. The production is pretty solid. Of course its all Cz up on this album. The guest appearances are sicc- C-BO, Mac Mall, Brotha Lynch, FedEx from Mob Figaz, EDI from Outlawz, Set Shakur- Pac's younger sister, and a few more underground mcs. All in all it is straight West Coast funk for your trunk. Bump it in a system- it sounds tight. Pick it up or check out Killa Tay on one of the many West Coast compilations out there-"
3,????,"Tay's raps are on point,but the production is lackin.Personally I like Tay's production,but he only produced a few tracks this time.I give his first album 5 stars though."
3,killa tay needs to stop yelling,This cd would be four stars If killa tay didn't yell. Every word he says he yells. I like most of his lyrics but I dont like how he raps it.As far as beats go it's a mixture of hardcore and the bay area sound. Best track in my opinion is so serious.
3,Inspired but not accomplished,"Very interesting work indeed, and certainly inspired by the Author's personal ghosts, but not entirely accomplished. It could have been a literary achievement, but it would have probably needed more time to grow, as the House, with more care given, more pages and tortuos dreams. The graphics are an original contribution but should have been used with spare. Just a small part of the pictures published would have been enough and should have been chosen with superior delicate attention and put at the proper place, which is not always the case.ALL THIS DOES NOT MEAN I DID NOT LIKE THE BOOK: it is a very entertaining and compelling story, very close to ancient occult ideas about space and time. And the Author is someone I would like to meet to convince her to write a new, definitive version which I would be very glad to print."
1,"Basically, it stunk","Basically, it stunk. The DVD cover made it look like it might be really good. But I had a hard time making it to the end, and felt tempted many times to hit the ""Stop"" button and almost fell asleep during some of the slow moronic scenes. It came off not like a movie, but more like a bad horror music video, but without the music and loaded with incoherent freeze-frame scenes. Makers of ""Thriller"" need not worry.Now what made me watch it then, aside from the DVD cover? Well, Victoria Maurette is hot. I kinda liked the final tag line, something like ""Vengence will exist until there is no reason for it anymore"", as Maurette shoots dead the ""can't die"" bad guy ghost vengence-killer, after he kills off all the evil prostitutes.There was a kernel of an idea for a story in there somwhere but it got mangled up and trashed in all that junk of a movie."
3,NOT AS BAD AS YOU THINK...,"At least it is not as bad as the many other reviews here on Amazon. The one main problem with this film, IS the many constant freeze-frame shots. They do become a head ache after awhile, and are over done and over used. As for the acting, well it is something to be desired... but I've seen worse. The FX's are somewhat low budget, but passable. The biggest problem, beside the constant freeze frame shots... was the scene with the dead impaled baby... pretty gruesome!In the short, this is not a bad movie... it is not a great movie... it is a decent film. It could have been a awesome movie with different actors and director... but, what do you want from a b-movie? Citizen Kane?"
1,I THINK THIS WAS FILMED IN MY BACKYARD,Complete Garbage. I love Horror movies and Westerns. This REALLY isn't either one. I'm not sure how this got out of the can. Somebody knows someones Uncle in the business or something.Watch this only if you like watching the paint dry or if you like to watch water boil. If so then this is for you!Negative stars x infinity.
1,AWWWFUL,"I don't even recognize this as being a movie. Its garbage and I feel bad for those who paid to see it. I could only take 20 minutes of the bad acting, sound, lack of story development except on the back of the cover and it looks liked it was filmed on the side of the road or anywhere where they found a few trees. Not a western or horror, not even good enough to be a music video. Sorry, but I don't like being ripped off!"
3,watchable. freeze frames gave me a headache,Watchable western genre. in the vein of the jonah hex film. not sure on budget but ok especially for comic book fans. freeze frame action was unexplainably used often and gave me a headache.
2,Disappointing,"I love all of Cresswell's books with only this as an exception. I must say that it is so un-Cresswell. Maybe because it is co-written. I saw the movie He Said ,She said and it was so funny and entertaining that I thought this book would be the same."
3,Basic Introduction,"This book provided essential -- but very basic -- information about Basset Hounds in a well-illustrated media. It barely skimmed the surface of Basset Hound ownership for a book, but was par for the price paid."
5,Mind-Expanding,"This is one of the best books I have read in recent years. It takes a firm stand against a culture that encourages young women to flaunt their sexuality in a counter-progressive manner, but manages never to be prudish or conservative. One of my favourite parts about it is Levy's ability to earnestly confront counter-arguments and acknowledge shades of grey. She doesn't want you to give up your bikini; she just wants you to consider why you're wearing it."
2,From a 1970s feminist - I have something to teach you,"Levy's arguments sound all too familiar - women were once told that we were playing into a ""false consciouness"" meaning that we could not trust our own judgement. Women are not victims. We are equal players. There is no male-centered sexuality as Levy purports. When are feminists (of which I value myself to be) going to stand up, stop crying victim and denounce books like this? contrary to what Levy says in her book, I am no victim of some evil male world. I did not raise my daughters to be victims either. It is telling that this book is garnering the support of the neo-conservative agenda - it is the same old tired story of the powers that be dividing women so that we won't fight the real powers that be. Enough already!"
2,Can't we all just get along?,"This will sound simplistic and philosophical, but I think most men and women in our culture are both mis-treated equally in different ways. Most of it in my opinion relates to a poor upbringing, possibly abuse, and emotional immaturity. We learn this behavior and it's almost too complicated to figure out. It's sad and I hope someday we can mature and evolve to respect each other to reach an optimal quality of life."
