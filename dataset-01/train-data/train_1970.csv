5,Great purchase,Good business with Amazon. Got the same product and saved $30 if I would have baught it in a store. Add free shipping and you can't lose.
5,The Best Coffee Made,"This is the third Krups Coffeemaker that I have owned. I keep buying them because Krups makes the best tasting coffee of any coffeemaker and I have tried many leading brands. My only complaint is that after brewing, and about 15 minutes, the coffeemaker beeps and then shuts off. A good feature for most people rushing off to work, but as I am retired and love that extra cup (2+), I sometimes have to turn it back on again (and it stays on after that). In other words, it's a damn near perfect coffeemaker. In the future, Krups may have to add the ""retired person hold button"" to the control panel."
2,little annoyances,"I really wanted a thermal carafe, and this looked perfect- good name and good price. But there are some problems- first no measurements on the carafe, so you can't tell how many cups you have, and when you use the gauge on the machine, it gets the air bubbles and you still have no idea how many cups you are making. And if you should put too much water in the machine, it just pours out the back. Also, in order to get really hot coffee, you have to prepare the carafe with hot water before it brews, which kind of makes the auto timer useless. other than those problems, if you can get the measurements right and prep the carafe, you will get a really good, hot cup of coffee. It does stay hot for about 2 hours at least once prepped."
4,A little wary of this produxt,"This machine makes good coffee. But, I don't trust the spring latch for the filter/grounds. All in all though it was a good price and it does make good coffee. It just seems that Krups could do a better job than this."
2,something is wrong,"Something is wrong with this product. There is a chemical smell and taste to the coffee that makes it undrinkable. It has happened more than a few times and I'm ready to give up and try to return it. I have been making coffee in my house for 20 years, with the same water and coffee beans, so it isn't a chemical in the water. The filter holder seems to have a smell, but so does the inside of the pot at times. I don't know what this is but it's not good!"
1,Java Problems,"I bought this Krups to replace a beloved Krups thermal carafe that sadly passed on. This new model features too many flaws. For one, the swing-open filter door doesn't always engage. Minor issue. If you pour your water into the machine too quickly, bubbles can form in the window, so you're never quite sure how much is in the machine. Further, my model always seems to leak both water and brewed coffee from the bottom of the machine. Granted, it's only the size of a quarter or half-dollar, but you don't expect this from a Krups. Finally, the carafe, itself, pours so broadly that leaks are inevitable. Sadly, this product does not live up to the Krups' reputation."
4,"Makes delicious coffee, not very durable","This coffee maker makes delicious coffee. I love the thermal aspect - it stays warm and toasty longer. The timer is quite useful.The whole thing just seems a bit cheaply constructed. Lots of plastic parts that don't seem durable. It hasn't broken yet, but one wrong move may change that.PLEASE NOTE: I purchased the gold filter to go with the Krups FMF5 10-cup programamable coffeemaker - since on Amazon, it was something that people purchasing the coffeemaker were also buying. I hadn't had anything but a ""paper filter"" coffeemaker before. Anyhow, this filter does NOT FIT inside the filter holder on the Krups FMF5 10-cup programmable coffeemaker. Paper is the only option for you."
5,Finally a good cup of joe,"I had a Krups (white plastic with glass lined carafe) that lasted about 15 years. I was disappointed to discover there was little improvement in the R&D dept. I bought a Cuisuinart that lasted less than 3 months before the element burned out. Then I found this one. While not a great improvement over my last Krups, it does the job. I love it and hope at lasts as long as the last one."
4,"Good coffee, takes getting used to","I have had a Krups Programmable Coffeemaker for ages. My old 12 cup with glass carafe died and I thought I'd try a thermal carafe to save the energy of keeping the coffee warm. I have learned to pre-warm the carafe with hot water and it does a good job for a couple of hours. I admit that I like my coffee hot!What takes getting used to is that the basket that holds the coffee grinds does not always stay shut and the coffee drips through anyway. This creates a huge mess of coffee all over the counter and floor. The first couple of times, I didn't know what the problem was. If you don't carefully lock the lid on the carafe and make sure it is completely inserted, the coffee basket can appear to be closed, but then open and not work properly. We seem to have the system down and are happy with the coffee maker, but I do think that it is a design flaw that the coffee runs through when the carafe is not in position."
2,Disappointed,"While the product looks very nice it fails at keeping coffee hot for more than an hour. It also claims to have a no-drip spout. That is totally incorrect. I have to make sure to pour a cup for myself over the sink. I am already in the market for a new coffee maker, but I can promise that it will not be a Krups. This maker might be worth $10-$20, not $90+."
4,Krups quality coffee,"I love not having to worry about breaking the pot, early mornings before I put on my glasses that is a risk!But, I did take off one star because of the lid. Just a little contrary but not a deal breaker. Does make that signature Krups taste, just drink it fast as it's not super hot."
5,Excellent coffee,"The coffee is brewed quickly and the coffee tastes delicious. This is our second Krups FMF514 and this one will be used at our vacation home, the original has given us many years of service and is still in use at our home."
1,Just Returned,"I too, Had the problem with plastic taste even after about 15 pots of water or coffee. I E-mailed KRUPS to give them a chance to recommend a solution. 2 days with no reply. I am now seeing the other problems that I read in the other reviews including big bubbles in sight glass, coffee doesn't stay hot for long unless the carafe is preheated with hot water and the carafe is generally not user friendly along with the filter basket. This was too many strikes against it so I was lucky enough that I could still exchange it. I replaced it with a Cuisinart. No more KRUPS for us."
3,A Hassle to Use,"- Bubbles in the window, so to offset this I fill the carafe with the clean water to where I want it and use this to pour into the machine but, the machine design makes it very difficult to pour into without spilling over the side.- The basket keeps popping open towards the end of the brew cycle, no matter how well I try to latch it.- It is very difficult to pour the last cup of coffee.- The brewed coffee does come out weaker.+ I didn't notice any plastic smell or taste.+ Coffee stayed warm enough for a pretty long time.I definitely would not buy this machine again."
2,Was a great coffee maker for 1 year and 15 days,I really enjoyed this thing while it lasted. Excellent tasting coffee and a very effective thermal carafe. I would give it 4 stars if it hadn't died exactly 15 days after the warranty period expired. Think I'll try a Zojirushi next.
1,Rubbish,This coffee maker has made exactly one pot of coffee and then died. A completely useless piece of junk that I would not recommend to my worst enemy. Do not buy this product. If someone gives it to you as a gift -- return it.
1,Worked less than 2 months,"The machine worked great, for about 2 months. Since Amazon's 30 day return policy had expired I am now dealing with Krups, who are telling me to ship it to the service center at my own cost so they can inspect and repair. I can hope to hear from them in 6-10 weeks. NOT a happy shopper."
2,filter tray swings open,"I am not loving this coffeemaker. While I don't have trouble with the taste, the bubbles make it hard to tell how many cups you are brewing, the coffee does not keep the temperature very long, and it is difficult to pour. Also, and it might just be mine, but the coffee filter tray swings open and lets steam out when it is nearly done finished brewing. Is it supposed to do that??"
2,we're returning it and exchanging for Cuisinart's Brew Central 12cup,"Yes, there is a plastic smell. It is coming from the base, which sits on the burner (why?!). Heat plastic, plastic burns, smells like burnt plastic - duh!The carafe is a terrible design - the collar around the top prevents you from pouring the last half a cup, so you have to turn the thing upside-down to get all the coffee out. Dumb.Looks great, makes good coffee, but these are fatal flaws. Bummer."
1,Luke Warm,"Like everything in the world, this coffee maker is lawyer approved. In other words it does not get hot enough to cause any harm. Unfortunately one minute after poring it is not hot enough to be considered a good cup of coffee.Every day I have to warm my coffee up in the microwave."
1,Plastic smell,"We've had this appliance for over a month and cannot get rid of the plastic smell. I tried cleaning the pot and lid with vinegar, but the coffee it brews still has a stench.Save yourself the money and don't bother purchasing this coffeemaker."
5,Glad i choose this one,"After a long week of reviewing coffee makers, i choose this one, mainly due to the fact that i love my coffee, had a Krups for years before buying this one, (glass caraff)and the on off switch broke on the last one. I was willing to pay more for GOOD coffee but have found that Krups makes a wonderful cup compared to commercial brews. (have family in the barista buisness) While nothing will EVER compare to a quick stroll through Starbuck's, I use and love this coffee maker every morning, and it keeps my coffee fresh tasting for hours while staying hott."
4,"Overall, a very good coffee maker","I read a lot of reviews on Amazon before ordering this product. Overall, I'm very satisfied.First, the size is great and fits under my kitchen cabinets without taking up a lot of counter space. Second, the brewing temperate is very good. Most coffee makers use very hot water (not boiling water) to get the best coffee taste. People who like boiling hot coffee should not buy this coffee maker. People who like ""regular"" hot coffee will like this coffee maker.Third, the carafe keeps the coffee near brew temperature for several hours. Finally, it's easy to use and clean.The only downside I've found with this product is that the getting the last half-cup of the coffee out of the carafe requires a lot of wrist twists and gymnastics. Since we don't usually finish the complete pot anyway, I just rinse the last bit of coffee out and leave it to drain."
4,Its a matter of which one,"I recently bought this for my son and daughter-in-law while visiting with them. They are so in love with this coffeemaker. They said its the best coffeemaker they ever owned. Then when we returned home, our own Krups finally gave up. We hoped to find this same model to replace our old one, but it wasn't available in our local store. Shame on us for not using Amazon. We bought the KT4065 model instead and what a major mistake that was. If you are trying to decide which Krups to buy - this is the model to go with. Don't pay attention to all the negative reviews because this is truly THE best brand of coffeemaker out there and this model is almost like our old one which is quite a compliment. You will be disappointed if you go for the KT4065 or other models. Sadly Krups shipped their production to China. Too bad. It definitely has made a negative difference."
5,Would not Change!,"I will keep this short. I have bought the most expensive of the expensive coffee makers thinking I would get a good cup of coffee. There is no coffee pot that compares to this Krups. It is perfect coffee every time. There is not one coffee maker I have tried that provides the taste this coffee maker is able to produce. Every other coffee maker on the market leaves a taste in your mouth. If you can't work through any hiccups you may be experiencing with this coffee maker and you move on to another coffee maker, you will be drinking coffee that is far less superior. BEST COFFEE MAKER! BEST COFFEE! COMES OUT HOT BUT NOT TOO HOT! STAYS WARM FOR HOURS! BREWS A POT OF COFFEE IN LESS THAN THREE MINUTES! QUALITY!!!!!!!!"
1,The Defective Coffeemaker And Silent Merchant,"A week after the coffee maker came, it started blowing a circuit in the house. I contacted the merchant and was able to get the required paperwork for replacement. It was ""Fedex'd.\,"" from Office Max in Auburn, on Saturday, October 31. We have heard nothing since!When we got the coffeemaker, we could never get the clock to work, but thought that it would be okay until we could get the paperwork to get a replacement. It started blowing the circuit a couple of days later.My wife would like our money back, but we would lose 15% for restocking a defective coffeemaker.We have purchased 2 Krup coffeemakers - from different vendors and they were both defective."
1,leaky piece of junk,The coffee does not stay hot; and after six months the coffee maker has developed a leak and there's always water on the counter under it. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money.
1,a BIG disappointment,"My previous thermos carafe Krup coffee maker was great. This new Krips stainless carafe coffee maker has a carafe that is hard to pour and absolutely does NOT keep the coffee warm. Also, the carafe is hard to clean.When I contacted Krups, their representative just seemed not to really care.Krups no longer makes a truly insulated carafe coffee maker that is easy to clean and will keep your coffee warm.A very BIG disappointment!"
2,Krups Coffee Maker,"The coffee maker made good coffee, however there is a fundamental defect in the electronics of the unit, since we went through 2 coffee makers that stopped working with the first unit that the display showed empty when the coffee maker was full of water and the second coffee maker that the display was stuck blinking and would not make coffee."
1,Not a Fan,I have had this coffee maker for a few years and it just now died completely. I have not been a fan almost since day one.I do like the thermal pot and that is about it. The programmer is confusing IMO with a lot of features that are just dumb. I have had the programming guide next to the machine since I bought it and I am not usually an idiot when it comes to this sort of thing. The clock has always run slow. Just today it decided not to bother brewing and I am on the hunt for a new pot - I won't be getting this one again
1,A Krummy Krups,"I have now ordered two of these coffeemakers, and they've both had the same problem with the opening/closing mechanism. The door to the coffee filter basket does not open properly or stay closed. Also, the water measuring tube often fills with air bubbles so you are unable to read accurately how much water you've poured in. I was very disappointed in this Krups product."
5,Perfect !,"This may be the last gas grill you'll ever purchase. It's that good. If perfectly cooked steaks to smoked salmon and succulent roasts have eluded you in the past and your culinary efforts failed to impress your family and friends, this may be your answer. Six independent burners that start effortlessly at the push of a button, an all stainles steel large cooking area that can accomodate enough steraks hamburgers and hot dogs to feed an entire garden party and not take you all night. Flavorizer bars and a smoker box below the cooking grates that give your BBQ meats a taste and flavor to remember. Quality construction throughout. Looks great, outstanding quality and perfect outdoor cooking. I use it 3-5 times a week now and could not be happier."
5,the perfect grill!,"I got this grill for my husband and we absolutely love it!!We've grilled everything on it from our Thanksgiving turkey (on the rotisserie) to ribs to mackerel. Maybe the other weber grills might have been adequate but we don't regret getting this beauty. In the summer, we used it 3-5 days a week. Since we live in northern California, we use it often in the winter as well.Clean up is a breeze. Turn on all 6 burners on high for about 30 minutes and the grill is clean. We've had this grill for about 8 months now and it is wonderful."
5,Hate Harry the Singer? Then You'll LOVE This One (I Do),"Personally, i'm not fond of Harry Connick the singer. He's a good singer but that's not my thing. I'm into jazz and if you want to hear a solid album of piano jazz, buy this. It's good. I'm reasonably sure this was his FIRST EVER album. I remember hanging around with someone who worked for Columbia records when this came out in vinyl and they said 'you might like this' and handed me a copy. I did. I still do. My thing is mainly Blue Note/Prestige classic era bop and I like this."
1,Did not like.,Stories did not interest me. Many had no closure to the story. I would not recommend this book to my friends.
2,I like Thorpe- but get the import!,"If you happen across this cd, although it is now listed as out of stock by Amazon, steer clear! Buy the import instead! While there is an additional track and the last 2 songs Free Enterprise and East of Edens Gate are good (especially the uptempo Enterprise)it is not the original COTS which can be found in its entirty on the import. This is trimmed, and not as good.But this album, in general, is really cool spaced out music, much like Billy Squier meets Pink Floyd!Way ahead of its time for a late 70's release!"
3,Children of the Sun,"Honestly i have only listened to the song ""Children of the sun"" off this album but if any of his songs are even compareable to that one it might be worth taking time to listen to the entire album. Billy thorpe captures the wonder,awe and mystery of ""aliens""in america 20 years ago all the way up until today!He portrays them as peaceful celestial beings with a desire to communicate their knowledge to us. To SHOW us!"
5,Thanx,"Thanks for the high quality of product, & service, I've come to expect from Amazon. Top notch Product. Smooth, uncomplicated transaction process.Look forward to shopping here.TRS."
2,Bunk,"This is the end result when a brochure worth of useful material is converted into a nearly 300 page book. The useful tips in here can be easily found for free over the web. The rest of the book is useless anecdotes, irrelevant passages from various sources, snake oil type exercises that are first described, then drawn into illustrations, the re-explained and this ploy is repeated ad nauseum.There may be a good book out there that truly teaches the art of rapid reading. This is not it."
3,A Little Faster Please!,"This is one of the best ""speed reading"" type books I have seen in a long time. It is full of practical exercises that are easy to practice on your own even after finishing the book. One advantage is that you use your own materials to practice various techniques. This helps the content be more interesting which in turn helps to ensure the reader's success. The techniques are presented in a very easy to follow format which means it is easier to accomplish the task of increasing reading speeds."
3,"Wonderful content, but format feels more like class notes turned into a book","The book has helped me save time on my reading. However the content is sometimes ambiguous and confusing, leaving me wondering which drill exactly it was talking about. If there's a more updated version, get that.If you're willing to deal with a little ambiguity though, it is worth your time to read and run through the drills. The approach seems more comprehensive than several others I have previewed prior to choosing this book.Topics covered include: linear reading, visual reading, strategies for understanding and structuring different kinds of content. The main value is in the week by week drills, which step you through practicing comprehension and speed independently, then bringing them back together.Although the format could use some revising, the content has been invaluable. Good luck!"
5,"Quick, effective, and astounding","I started this book only two weeks ago and have quadrupled my reading rate. I was a very slow reader and it caused me many dificulties. I tried many computer aplications and other books, but nothing truly helped like this book. It tells you exactly what the problem is and exactly how to fix it. Although its a fairly large time commitment, I found myself looking forward to the time I set aside to drill, just because I was so amazed at the improvements. It used to take me a month to get through a book, if I didn't get so tierd that I put it down, and now I can get through a 200 page book in around two hours!"
5,Can work wonders for your speed!,"I didn't find the comprehension tips very helpful, but my speed simply skyrocketed. I'd never been a fast reader before, averaging only around 300 words per minute. But more and more I found out as I move on to college, reading would become an invaluable skill. I started to read many books that claimed to ""triple"" your speed, but to no avail. However, when I read this book, my speed jumped from 300 to 500 within ONE WEEK. And after 5 weeks I could read as fast as 1500 words per minute. It was a miracle! All the drills really push you to sweep through material FAST - and with lots of practice you get used to it and speed reading becomes a part of you. I'm so thankful because not only does that take a huge burden off my shoulders for future reading, it also impresses my friends when I can go through an English book within 2 days while they work on it for 3 weeks!"
3,Outdated but adequate,This book covers the basics but you have to look hard to find them. This book came out in 1998 so it is a bit dated especially with the new training software that is available now. Reading pages in a book and timing yourself is a pain. I would say go with some newer software like Speed Reader-X or Ace Reader (just search amazon to find them) which is much easier to use and has newer updated information.
4,Yes - This Works!,"I was amazed tha after reading only a few chapters, I was reading at double my former speed. The approaches presented in this book worked so well I finished one selected book in a matter of hours. Something I've never done before since I'm generally a very slow reader.However, one thing to keep in mind is that you have to be consistent and dedicated with practice readings over a period of of many weeks & months or you'll lose the ""momentum"" of what's being taught. Overall though, I'm quite pleased with my progress.Oh, and you should acquire a reliable, easy-to-operate stop-watch for the practice readings as you'll have to adjust allowed reading times regularly during sessions."
2,Not Much Use Without the Forms,"I liked the reviews on this book and was happy to see there was a Kindle version. One problem, though. There are multiple forms in the back of the book used for the exercises. I searched all over the 'Net and could not find an online version of them. Now I have to either buy the print book or create the complicated forms myself. Too bad there isn't some standard that Kindle books must be as functional as the print version in order to be accepted."
1,speed reading isn't better reading,"I gave up half way through this book. I was completing the objectives for the drills and doing 3-4 drills every day afterwards, plus I read a lot.I've always been a slow reader and thought this book would help me, but I'm interested in reading fiction and the reading style this book teaches is ""speed reading"". I simply get less out of the books I read at my leisure using this method and I don't read any faster.Once I got to the chapter on ""dusting"" I had had enough.This book was a terrible waste of time for me."
2,This is a joke.,"I'm a university student with top grades from my university in Canada. I find that with complicated material I tend to be a little slower reader so I set out to improve my speeds. I picked up this book and was very enthusiastic about becoming a better reader, however, I was disappointed. Using your finger is to say the least, annoying. When you increase speed you can surely understand what your reading but I find it very hard to maintain retention. If you're reading a newspaper or magazine, fine, but if it's something saturated in information it is not realisitic that you can improve your reading speed by 2 or 3 times with resonable retention with this text. Maybe if you went to the courses that the author offers over a few months you could improve, but I think it is a joke if you think this 10 dollar book will do the trick."
2,only recommended for people who are problem readers,"I don't think that these methods really work for people who are already competent readers. Rather, they are intended to assist people who have problems concentrating on a printed page because they watch too much television.This book makes reading much more difficult. I read very quickly before the exercises and didn't see much improvement in my speed. The effort to use my finger as a pacer was not worth the slight improvement in speed.If you read slowly, I can see how this book can help you. It will train you to concentrate on a printed page and give you a method of retention that will become second nature. However, if you are fairly intelligent and have no problems reading or retaining, the book is more or less a waste of time."
1,Over priced kindle edition 17.99.,"At the time of this review, this book on kindle cost 17.99. It is over priced. you can get the same info in a 4.99 paperback or in more up to date books. all of these rapid reading programs are common knowledge now and written about by many authors. This book was first published in 1979 and this revised edition includes words like email and computer."
3,More of the same,"This is my 3rd book on this topic. For the most part, the first part of the books are all the same. The main difference being how much time the author spends telling you how wonderful they are and how strangers at bus stops come up to them and kiss their hands. The basics are here; pacing, no re-reading, and learning to see groups of words. Bottom line with speed-reading - If you want it, you will have to work for it and consciously practice it until it becomes 2nd nature (It took you years & years to get to that level with normal reading, guess how long it will take learnig to read this way?) Happy trails."
1,Scary heater,"I am originally from Maine and I now reside in San Antonio, Texas, where we are experiencing some very unusual cold weather and I felt the need to break down and buy a heater. I just bought this heater at Target based on Consumer Reports recommendation. Scary. I plugged it in, billows of smoke appeared, and a small flame shot out from one of the heating elements. I immediately turned it off and inspected the heater. One of the elements was broken in three different places. This is a brand-new heater, folks. I read another review listed here of someone who had the same problem. It sounds like a serious safety recall notification is in order from Holmes. Be careful."
2,Electric Heater,The Holmes HQH319=U Quartz Tower Heater was nice except only one side worked. I had to send it back for a refund.
4,Holmes HQ319-U Quarts Heater,"I didn't realize how big it was. It is an excellent heater, but I would have liked a smaller one that put out the same amount of heat. It heats quickly, and the thermostat makes it easy to control"
3,"Reasonably quiet, good heat for a small area only","This heater works well in a small area like a den or a small bedroom, but in my 14 x 14 kitchen it just can't put out enough heat to make a big difference. It is better as a heater to put near your feet in a chilly room or in a room that needs a ""boost"". But a grat deal for the money, and I'd buy another if I needed a space heater for another small room. Not too noisy and I feel better knowing it will shut off if it tips over."
5,Love it!,Sandy flooded me out and these heaters really did the job. When we got the power back we bought more.
4,A good heater,"We use this heater in our basement. The heater is a little louder than I expected, but it warms a person very well, even in a large area."
1,lasted about a month,"I bought this online (a great deal directly from Holmes for only $25) because I had a similar quartz heater made by another manufacture but without the digital thermometer.When arrived, the Holmes model looked otherwise identical, but within a couple of weeks it began to shut off unexpectantly, and after a couple more weeks, stopped working totally. I unplugged it for a couple of hours and it still didn't work, despite shaking it, etc. It's dead, except for the pretty digital reading lights.Into the trash it goes, and I definitely won't buy a digital Holmes model again. (In the meantime, my non-digital Patton Quartz heater keeps is still going after 4 months)."
1,Shuts off all the time - junk don't buy!,"Like many others I bought this thinking it would be a good addition to provide heat to a small room. The unit turns off all the time and it has to be unplugged and reset to get going again. It must be the overheat feature but the unit comes on for a just moments and then shuts off when the room or unit is definitely not that hot. The buttons are silly, you have to cycle through a series of times to set it. They definately need to put this one back on teh shelf and try again."
3,Too noisy. Returned it.,"I bought this to use in my office and bedroom at night. The heat is very nice and warm. But when it turns on, the noise is very loud and disturbs me while working and wakes me up when sleeping. It's also fairly noisy during operation, but definitely that start-up is louder than I want to deal with. So I returned them today."
3,"Good Heat, but Hot. Not good with Kids or Pets Around","I was satisfied with this heater in terms of it's heat output and good design, but if you have kids or pets, I'd look for something that isn't hot to the touch."
1,Electronic one touch has a glitch.,Try electronic one touch control has a glitch that causes the caution light to come on and that shuts the heater down automatically. Reset does no good as it just continues to react the same way.
4,"Does its job, with only a few minorly annoying quirks","This product, corresponding with most the reviews I read for the product before purchasing, does a great job at heating small- to medium-sized spaces, and has great safety features that make using a space heater much less worrisome. However, the heater is quite loud and does glow red, which can be annoying if you are planning on using this in a bedroom. The front of the heater also does get quite hot so children and animals should be kept away. I am using this heater to heat the back area of my house, which our central heat does not reach. It is great, and I love the easy-to-use thermostat which turns off the heater once it reaches the specified temperature. I only wish that it had more flexible thermostat settings that the user could adjust. But overall, a great product and definitely worth the price."
3,I really wanted to like this better....,"but unfortunately I don't. There are some moments of ""coolness,"" for lack of a better description, disbursed within the songs, but overall it lacks fluidity. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for mixing it up, but it just doesn't work...also, a lot of the songs sound way overproduced, like she was trying too hard. Oh yeah, and one more thing...I love Sophie's voice, but there are some strained moments here and it was like fingernails on a chalkboard - track 11 for one. It starts out beautiful and then halfway through...yikes!"
2,Whaler II,"I think the subject line says it all, but Amazon won't let me leave this part blank, so here goes... Wilderness is a sequel to Whaler. If you like the Whaler side of Sophie, then you'll really love this one; its a logical evolution of her pop & jazz elements. But if you're more of a Timbre/TAT fan, you might be disappointed, because this album doesn't showcase her dark, explosive passion, nor does it highlight her musical/rhythmic innovation. Vocals, however, are excellent as always."
3,Sophie is no longer the Darkest Childe,"Based on the style of her latest release ""Wilderness"", it sounds like Sophie has begun a new, happy chapter in life. Songs are bright, rhythms are crisp, and instrumentation is clean (no distorted guitars). She sings in her upper octave register the way she did for much of ""Whaler"".Of course, the downside is that you don't get to hear the angst and grit that defined most of ""Timbre"" and ""Tongues and Tails"". The Wilderness Sophie doesn't use profanity, nor does she scream, nor does she whisper provocatively, nor does she shred a mean electric guitar, nor does she explode on the drum set. This is the kinder, gentler Sophie."
5,the one,"I have this tv and it has a better picture than my friends 65"" mitsubishi, 40 to 45 for hd is optimal."
1,Not as it seems.,I bought this dvd because the info said that it had in it the coverage of Charter Hospital leading you to believe that it is the story they aired on tv. Not at all. I watched the entire dvd and they showed a 5 second segment on the hospital and not the 20-30 minute segment they aired on tv. That is why I gave it 1-star. The info is very misleading! A waste of money!
5,Absolutely fantastic!!!,Great work about Indian history. I loved it so much that I bought a second copy after I had to give my first one as a gift to my mother in law.
1,Blechhhh!,"I confess. I bought a copy. I try to buy all productions of this favorite G&S story of mine, simply to complete the collection as much as possible. Despite the inclusion of Anna Russell as Katisha, it is a rather dismal adaptation. Made in 1972, it is done in the style of Saturday-morning cartoons of that period, and the music rescored to reflect the pop music of college days. I didn't like either, even then. I didn't expect a whole lot, and I was not disappointed. Mikado fans will perhaps enjoy it as a curiosity, but it is one of those things you watch one time, and then put quietly away."
5,Very Satisfied,"This shipped out very fast, and was well packaged. Now I just can't wait to use these dies. Great deal!!!!"
4,Great Blade - Terrific Deal,"ATS-34 steel holds an edge, is tough and stain resistant. Knives featuring ATS-34 blades can cost hundreds of dollars - not my idea of an everyday knife. The ATS-34 EZ-Out is the first production knife using this superior steel, and Gerber has ground and finished the blade to a high production level. It is an attractive knife at its suggested retail price ... At this price it is a terrific deal.My first impression of the ATS-34 EZ-Out was surprise at its lightness. It opened smoothly and locked crisply. The handle felt thin - much thinner than my Buck and Case knives. My issues with the handle disappeared when I checked its edge. I've used it for a couple of weeks now - cutting up old cardboard boxes, working with leather, cutting nylon straps. It's still razor sharp.This is not a comfortable whittler's knife. It is a serious knife that cuts when you need it, stays sharp, won't rust, and disappears into your pocket."
2,NOT like the image,The product is fine... it just isn't what I ordered. The color scheme AND design is different. I would not have ordered it as it came.
5,Happy,Gift for grandson. He was sooo happy with the suite. Has been it more that out of it. Now all his buddy's what one:)
3,Looks good but very delicate,"This costume looks good once it's on, but the material is fairly thin and the tie straps and face cover are virtually useless."
3,ok for the price,this out fit will not last long due to the material. however my kid likes it. worth the price paid.
2,Just okay,"The costume material wasn't what I thought it would be. I was thinking it would be cloth, however it was a very thin nylon.The overall look was cool and my son liked.If you live in a cold climate your child will have to wear a jacket and that defeats the purpose.So in summation, look is cool, material is crappy.You can probably do better."
4,Perfect for Halloween,"I bought the size Medium (ages8-10) for my 10 year old son. He is on the shorter side and pretty much a beanpole. This costume was perfect for him. He loved it. He cared that it was comfortable and looked cool. I cared that it held up in the washing machine (but line dry). Only con was that the ties at the bottom of the legs were frayed and tangled prior to first time wearing the costume. It is not necessary to have them tied, but makes the costume look better. My son just made it work, but it was frustrating that they came like that. Overall, very happy with the costume itself (top, bottom and headpiece all good quality)."
4,Worth it,"Got this for my 5 year old daughter who is going through a ninja phase. It's thin cheap polyester as expected but she loves it. We think this basic black ninja costume is far cooler than the ones with colorful flair and designs on them. She's an assassin, dammit, not a Broadway show extra."
4,My son love his costume!,"We love the look of the costume. The ribbons around the arms and legs are not very practical and some have already come off. Perhaps the ribbons could be replaced with material that is sewn in place as opposed to ribbon which does not stayed tied very well. Other than this, the costume is great!"
1,NASTY book.,This book paints LLoyd as being an immature creep. Dardis can't seem to handle the fact that Lloyd was extremely wealthy and had a relatively trouble free life with no scandals- he also seems to have something against his membership in the Shriners. A must-miss.
1,Zen arts researcher not impressed!,"Kuck's work does contain excellent descriptions of Japanese gardens. However, after researching Zen gardens, Kuck stands out as an uninformed Westerner perpetuating stereotypes about Zen Buddhism. Without more than a textbook knowledge of Japanese culture and Zen Buddhism, this is an easy mistake to make. There is a reason why this text is so difficult to find - it is outdated and contains many academic errors! I suggest looking for scholarship published more recently."
3,Not looking so good now,"Anyone having trouble with this set? My grandmothers looks very dim now, whereas I believe it looked much better in the past. I guess she may need a new bulb"
2,"not the best choice,perhaps","When my sister, and neice and myself went to Egypt in 1997, we took three guide books. The Fodors, Lets Go, and the Rough Guide. We threw the Fodors, and Lets Go out in Luxor, and used the Rough guide. We loved Egypt, and are planning another trip, Culture Shock would have been a good book to have read first. If you go to Luxor, go stay at Abul Kassem's place, just show up, its always empty. We also loved the Three Corners on the beach at Hurgada. Now i am dreaming again ......."
2,Don't bother,"I am from Texas but live in Chicago and anyone from Texas usually will always rep it, so when I ordered this cd I thought it would have some great Texas hits this is more like some underground cd but it was so weak that I listened to it once and threw it in the back seat of my truck. There was no really good Lil Keke, Bun B, Pimp C, Paul Wall, Lil Flip, or Chamillionaire songs just don't bother."
4,Great Buy,I purchased this for my son and he loves it. You have to figure out the puzzle in the book then enter the code into the game. It gives him hours of fun.
3,ENJOYED,THIS WAS A PRETTY GOOD BOOK. IT KEPT ME LAUGHING. DISAPPOINTED WITH THE ENDING. AND SURPRISED. ENJOYED IT TIL THE END.
3,Slow,"I don`t know why this movie garnered all the raves it received. I found it rather tedious. Perhaps in it`s day it was considered great but not by me today. I`m a big John Barry fan with many, many of his soundtracks including this one, but I don`t think this is one of the better ones so I won`t rave about it either."
5,Cool Mug!,I bought this to make a first fathers day mug for my husband with pictures of our daughter. He loved it! It's been holding up really well... no water has gotten in and the mug is a nice quality. I do handwash it as it says to do so. Very happy with this product. Will buy more in the future.
4,"Good product, templates could be better!","Good product, overall...would be nice if there were some easy way (online?) to insert photos for the sleeve. Do they really think people want to do it the old-fashioned scrapbooking way, with tape and scissors? I ended up making them in a drawing program, took a while to set everything up since the backgrounds you can download didn't work for me."
4,Good Buy,"Bought this item for my wife so she could have a coffee cup with some pics of the kids. Works great, but getting the pics in the cup can be somewhat difficult even with the template. Otherwise no complaints."
4,Marjorie shares her life with the extended family,"As a member of a wide extended family, within whose ranks Ms. Sandor grew up, I found this book delightful in its woven tapestry of mysticism and real-life meditations on life's ebb and flow. Her stories evoke a gentle tug on one's spirit, while discussing things as disparate as gardening and fly fishing. I look forward to more of Ms. Sandor's work."
3,"Beautifully written, but self-absorbed and ultimately sad","First the good points. She's an excellent writer. The stories are well-told, interesting, and her style is interesting. The personalities of many of the key characters remain obscure, yet we learn a lot about her father, Uncle, and a woman who helped raise her. I thought this was an interesting approach.But the story is ultimately a sad one. For no apparent reason she leaves her husband to take up with another man. The writing starts to get very dramatic and maudlin. ""The summer I fell in love and shouldn't have,"" is a phrase she repeats often. ""But that is his story to tell,"" she writes about her ex-husband, as if he has the opportunity to write books explaining his side of the story. She ultimately wants to see a woman who once helped raise her, in part because this woman won't judge her.The whole book left me feeling very sad. Sad for her daughter, he ex-husband, but not for the author, who did it to herself."
5,Great resource,This book is a great resource for common data patterns. We plan to use these patterns in all future programming.
1,Not Worth The Money,"I fell for the hype about ""never losing suction,"" but I found that it didn't have much suction to begin with. After using it several times and being dissatisfied with its performance on my carpets, I decided today to test it against my other vacuum cleaner, a Bissell, that has great suction. Starting with an area of 5 feet by 5 feet, I thoroughly cleaned with the Dyson, going over and over the rug. Then I went over the same area with the Bissell, and I was amazed at what the Bissell pulled up that the Dyson missed. Lots of cat hair and lots of kitty litter tracked into the room by my 7 cats."
1,Dead Animal,"I LOVED everything about my Dyson Animal but after perhaps 6-10 uses it started making a HORRIBLE noise and the beater bar would not turn. Turns out Dysons have plastic gears and they wear out prematurely. I would not buy another one - I loved my Animal but was sad (and ANGRY - they cost a FORTUNE!!!) when it died. Must be made in China - ??? I looked at Consumer Reports reviews on bagless vacs and I did not really find one that met all my ""wish list"" items - ease of handling, great cleaning, bagless, DEPENDABLE. These seem like simple needs - why are they so hard to fulfill?"
3,Depends on what you want,"Bought for a bottom of my front pants pocket (not cliped to the top). It comes with a clip (removable), but what I didn't notice on-line are the rubber pieces on the handle. They make it bulkier than I wanted and not as smooth as I wanted for a loose in pocket knife. Other than those things, it's fine. The knife handle is plastic and the blade can be opened and closed with one hand."
2,Not Worth Ordering,"I've have a lot of Gerber knifes, the one in my pocket is over 18 years old, so I thought I'd get a couple of these junior knifes for my 2 grandsons, All I can say is ""Do Not Buy This Gerber Junior Knife!"" Their are other Gerber knifes the same size, much cheaper, much better buildt and at half the price of these JUNIOR knifes. They are a real piece of junk!!!!! The price is much to high and the Gerber Quality Is Not Their! The clip is none removeable, even though it say's it is. I would have sent these knifes back, but we were pulling out of our driveway to go visit them in Wisconsin, just as they were delivered. I guess they thought they could get more money for these knifves by adding the word Junior on them, well they got me, but never again. Not even worth the cost of postage!"
4,Good Intro of Hellenism and Roman Period,"This book covers four broad areas of ancient history: non-Greek eastern Mediterranean civilizations, the Greek world, the Roman world, and late antiquity. It's a very ambitious project, especially since this is a slim volume (some 200 odd pages). I found only the Greek and Roman sections to be sufficiently detailed to make it worth reading. The other two sections were way too superficial and brief. I mean, how do you adequately cover the Hittites in two pages or the rise of Islam in a page? Why even mention them at all? That being said, I thought for an introductory work, the Greek and Roman sections were full of interest and engaging analysis. I think the authors were smart to focus on broad themes rather than a blow by blow chronological account. Overall, I would recommend this book, but only for its Greek and Roman histories."
3,For the learner preferring the concise.,"This is a book that provides a very concise picture of the ancient Mediterranean world. That may be good for some people, but it wasn't good for me. I'm taking a class on western civilization and I need a narrative, less encyclopedic style of writing--a book that would draw me in and help paint a coherent story.This book provides a concise overview. It is also very conceptual. Most of the interpretation is already done for the reader. I prefer information and data presented in a style that allows the reader to draw his/her own conclusions and make his/her own thoughts.The sample pages posted on Amazon gave the false impression of a thought-provoking and stimulating book. However it turned out to be a book organized around facts and a hierarchy of headings and concepts. It's hard to grasp history and concepts when it is spoon-fed. This is true because reference points are lacking. The reader has a hard time relating to the information."
1,"Sugar, Sugar, Sugar and Spice...But INot Everything's Nice","I purchased it at an anime con, just because I thought it sounded interesting. I mean, who wouldn't want to transform at will from a child to an adult or vice versa? However, I found it so boring I fell asleep. Also, the sweet nature of the anime as a whole would be enough to send a person into a diabetic coma or diabetic shock. There's angelically good, but this anime takes ""sweet"" to a whole other level entirely. It's like trying to eat an entire bag of sugar by itself in one sitting. Wanna try it, be my guest. But don't say I didn't warn you!!!!!!!!"
1,Questionable Manufacturing,"When my first TST240SS' center heating elements (both) didn't work, I returned it to Amazon (who were wonderful). When the second one arrived, I tried it in my office, before bringing it home. IT HAD THE IDENTICAL PROBLEM. I am willing to give Amazon one more try, as the toaster is cool looking, and if I get one that works, they apparently work well."
3,WE HAVE HOPE!,"This is our third Haier digital toaster. Our daughter gave us our first one many years ago (1996 or so) when we retired to the Outer Banks. It worked along nicely and then after a few problems, flung it's innards about the kitchen and died. We had liked it, and since it had worked for more than ten years, we bought a new one. But, this one went into collapse within two weeks. However, we felt that perhaps we had not read the rules, and so we invested in - ""Haier Digital Toaster III."" So far, we like it just fine. However, do not fail to read the rules.Haier TST240SS Stainless-Steel Long-Slot 4-Slice Digital Toaster"
5,A great toaster!,"I originally wanted the single-slot version of this toaster, but Amazon no longer carries it. So I got the two-slot. And I'm actually glad I did. I frequently toast breads that would not fit in a normal toaster and this one accommodates perfectly. The temperature control is nice, giving you a few seconds to adjust after starting. While it will toast more quickly once it has been warmed up, I have had no problem by just reducing the setting by one to prevent over-toasting the bread.The appearance was a big part of why I picked this toaster over any other long-slot toaster. While it does not stay on the counter all the time, when it is there, it looks sleek and nice. There are no unnecessary buttons or knobs and the lights are on only when the toaster is on. The warming tray is a nice idea, though I've yet to find a need for it. It is unobtrusive if not unnoticeable regardless. Highly recommended."
4,Like it,I read the mixed reviews about this product but liked the sleek design and thought I'd try it. We are VERY please with this toaster and hope it lasts for years.
2,I would not buy this toaster!,I bought this toaster for my husband this past Christmas 2010. We did not start to use the toaster until February and it is already broken. The elements are burnt out in one of the slots. We also had trouble getting the correct amount of toasting it either was too light or burnt. I was very disappointed in the toaster. It is a nice looking toaster and takes up little space but does not do the job!
5,Best toaster in 60 years of life,"Love it--perfect toast. Attractive. Just the features you need. I've owned them all. Kicks butt on Cuisinart, Black and Decker, etc."
4,Next best thing to calrods,"Wanted a long slot upright with calrods. Seems like all the upright calrods have gone out of production.... This toaster looks good....Blue ""countdown"" lights allow for time management with cooking other items. Considering it's a wire heating element, I'm satisfied.....relatively even browning. Long slot much more flexible for uses other than single bread slice toasters."
2,Do not buy this toaster,"Amazon has been a great source for many books I have needed for my sewing classes. I purchsed this toaster thru Amazon on 9/11/10 . Item was shipped from Edison NJ, via Abe's of Maine. We are not happy. Thought this would be a beautiful gift for my daughter's family with two teen agers, BUT we are very unhappy with its performance. Toasts uneven --brown on one end and almost burnt on the other. We are unable to regulate the degree of toasting and its bagel performance is not good. Tried to e-mail Haier/ Abe's of Maine and got no response, phone calls and messages not answered. Customer service very poor. Will never buy from them again. Do not wish to pay return shipping and am stuck with poor product. Want very much to purchase an Oster 6330 to replace bad toaster. Who do I go to for help.?????? Assume that I must rely upon Amazon for further assistance. Please help my solve my problem. A new toaster would make a great Christmas gift.Carolyn Steenson Dallas Ga"
2,Stop working in 3 months,"Purchased this toaster for good looks and price. After lite use the toaster just stop working. Followed Haiers instructions for a replacement which includes getting a case number, cutting off & sending in the cord along with $15 and never heard back from them. Have followed up twice and apparently my request got lost in the mail. I did not send it with a signed receipt because that was another $7.50. Haier now has instructed me to send in another check along with proof of purchase and they will honor the warranty. Seems reasonable but I wish I could give them a CC# and get on with it. Pretty losey warrantee if you ask me. I would be hard pressed to purchase Haier again."
2,"One Year, four months ....toast!","Nice looking, worked reasonably well, lasted 16 months then died. I expected more from a $60 toaster. Called Haier where the polite customer service seemed to be designed to take so much time that you just go away. After three calls they agreed to send me a credit toward a portion of the purchase price of a new toaster. But they could'nt tell me how much the credit would be, or when it would come. One would think that maybe they would want to make the customer happy or maybe find out what went wrong with their product. No more Haier products of any kind for me!"
3,Toaster Review,"This product is no longer supported by Haier, they no longer market toasters or even reference them on their web site.Toasts same as my 20 year old Philips did before it failed with a loose internal connection I have subsequently repaired.Burns edges of normal slices on darker settings, but does great job on the long slices which is what I purchased it for.Does not have a setting for toasting a single side of a piece of bread which my old Philips had."
5,Best Toaster ever,"Chose this to accommodate longer slices of bread. Who knew you could have bread perfectly toasted, edge to edge, the first time...four slices at a time? Loved it so much, I bought a second one for our vacation home. Highly recommend Haier stainless steel long slot 4 slice digital toaster."
4,Great toaster,Great toaster. Browns not completely even but what toaster does? It somehow knows only to brown on one side of an english muffin. Pretty happy with it overall.
3,Long-slot toaster,"After returning an Oster toaster because the inner elements didn't heat or toast, I had high hopes for this Haier. Why is it that no one can make a toaster that toasts both sides of the bread at one time?? I like the Haier features very much. BUT...it also browns the bread just on the sides facing out. The inner elements heat very little. I have to turn the bread around to toast the pale side. This is a pain but I won't return this toaster because we need one."
1,Doesn't last,"I would give it a zero, but that's not an option! It worked decently initially, but blew after only 4 months. Don't waste your time and money."
2,Works fine....while it works,"After 18 months, the spring mechanism is broken and the thing is useless. Expensive, nice looking product that doesn't last long."
1,Terrible manufacturer. Don't buy. Electric shock.,The thing stopped working on one side after six months and then one year to the date of receiving it...it caused me to get electrocuted... not fun. We unplugged it immediately. Don't buy to save your life a Haier product.
1,Was great until it broke after 14 months,"We shopped, read reviews and decided to go with this toaster. It had everything - style, price, performance and the promise of other good reviews.It always seemed a bit flimsy, but it did work fine. That is up until last week. It started jamming moving up and down and now it won't stay down at all. I figured I would take 20 minutes to try to fix it, but it has special screws on the underside that need a special bit that I do not have. So, yet another product in the land fill. I would gladly pay an extra $20-$50 for a toaster that would last me for years. Too bad the majority of America just wants the lowest price, so most manufactures build things as cheap as possible to last through the warranty period, then it is off to the dump."
3,Pretty although inconsistent,Toaster looks great on my counter and is very durable. However we struggle to get consistent toasting. I love the warming bar and the lights to tell you what's happening.
1,Haier TST240SS toaster,"I purchased this toaster as a Christmas present in 2010. Recently, the toaster ""exploded"" with an electrical arc shooting out from the end that is pushed for starting toaster. The owners contacted Haier about the issue and were told that ""yes, there is a danger of electrical malfunction."" The owners were instructed to fill out paperwork and return the toaster and they would receive a replacement toaster. However, Haier has no toasters available and instead sent a check for $21 which was less than half of the original price of the toaster. I would think that since they are aware of the electrical danger, they would at least refund the entire purchase price. They were very fortunate that there were no injuries which resulted from the malfunction. Quite a serious problem, I would say."
1,burnt toast,"I purchased this toaster in July 2011, I basically bought it because I liked the look of it. It was sleek and the proportions fit in my kitchen. It actually worked well for three months and then the end of October, the lever did not work and the toaster would not go on. After several attempts of looking through the brochure and trouble shooting, I contacted the company and as other reviewers stated, it was a hassle.The cost of sending it back, outweighed the cost of a new toaster.I was hoping to find someone in Philly, like Luis from Sesame Street to fix it. But I didn't want to take it on the Megabus to NYC. I think fixing toasters is a dying profession.Anyway, Don't purchase this product.DeeDee M.Philadelphia, PA"
2,Works Great - For One Year,"We spent a lot of time looking for a decent toaster (since our previous electronic toaster died within a year), and we were very pleased with this one. But - after one year (just after the warranty expired), it stopped working. We're now using a mechanical toaster from a second-hand store, probably 15 years old, $5. Don't waste your money on electronic toasters until a manufacturer makes one that will last."
2,"It works, but...","I was looking for something that I could put bread slices into, choose how dark I want it toasted, push a button and it would make toast. I wanted a simple toaster and the only factor complicating my choice is that I have a large family so I need one that can toast 4 regular slices or 2 large slices. After scouring the internet this seemed to be the one closest to fitting the bill without getting ridiculously expensive - we're talking about a toaster after all. I got and it works - 2 stars so far. It browns one side more than the other - no extra stars for even toasting. It will return to the default browning setting after each toasting - no extra stars for the convenience of being able to leave the toaster on the setting that you like. It will toast the next batch of toast differently from the first even if you set it the same - no extra stars for consistency. It takes a long time - no extra stars for speed."
1,DON'T DO IT,"I purchased this toaster because of the good reviews - don't believe them. When I received this toaster it did not work (the center coils did not heat). YOU CAN NOT REACH THIS COMPANY - when I tried their email, it rejected it saying wrong format (what????). When you try to call, the system hangs up on you or tells you this product does not exist. When I finally found a number to call after an hour of searching the net, they told me they would send a call tag and replace the toaster - never received it (I didn't actually think I would!) - I returned this to Amazon and told them I would'nt trust this company and I want a refund. I went out and purchased a $24.00 toaster that works perfectly. And one more thing - when I went to look at this again on Amazon - there was a message saying it wasn't for sale any longer because of trouble with the product - now it's for sale again. DON'T BUY IT"
1,Do not buy this toaster,"I purchased the toaster about 6 weeks ago, it quit working yesterday and we don't even use it that heavily.Called Customer Service - horrible - have to pay for shipping and quality of service is unacceptable. company obviously has lot's of quality issues (after googling the company) and doesn't stand behind their product. To pay about $25 in shipping to get a new $55 toaster back, is not customer satisfaction.when it worked, it worked ok, but not great. overrated!"
1,Still Hunting for a Great Toaster...,"After reading all the reviews (and you expect a few lemons and unhappy customers)and doing exhaustive research (toaster nerd!), I ordered this Haier long-slot stainless steel model. It worked perfectly for the first couple of months, and then slowly started showing signs of slowing down...(started toasting unevenly on one or both sides, never consistent toasting for a level, etc.) This morning was the last straw! I had it on ONE light, and it burned the waffle black to a crisp. I tried a second waffle, and put it on the two light level, just as a test, and it was pale as a ghost. What the heck! Also, this toaster is VERY hot to the touch. Sadly, I am going back to my hunt for the Holy Grail of toasters. I'll let you know when I find one. Is it too much to ask to have a decent taster that toasts relatively evenly and consistently for less than $500? Sheesh!"
2,mediocre,I had higher expectations. The toast do not come out even - the element are spaced apart so the toast have patterns of grilling. It takes longer to toast than my old toaster. As for the look of it if you bought it because its narrow and want to place it perpendicular to your counter at the end all you will see is the rather ugly black plastic end of the toaster - not the stainless.
2,It works.,My only wish is that I could turn off the back slot when not being used. Why heat up both for only one or two small pieces of bread?Otherwise it works pretty well.Edit... it stopped working (1/15/12). So there it is... Gotta look for a new one now. It should have lasted a lot longer. Changed my review from 5-stars to two.
3,Very good first impression,"We liked everything-look, work, features. However, in two weeks, heating element on the second slot stopped working. Haier promissed to send us a new one, after we send the cord and proof of purchase. We will see. I really hope the other one will work at least 3 years."
1,toaster doesn't work,"Right out of the box, and plugging the Haier TST240SS, the center heating elements failed to heat up. Looks great but it can't toast. Review asks me to give it one star, but really, zero is what it deserves."
4,Cool Toaster,"Hmm.. what does one say about a toaster that works... Well, it looks snazzy, it has pleasant blue lights. Hope it lasts..."
4,Good toaster. Handles bagels and home baked bread,"I like it. This toaster handles wider pieces of bread. Easy to store and clean. I wish it had the option to toasted 2 slices at a time instead of 4 all the time. Couldn't identify another toaster quickly enough so I went with this one and we're happy. Not sure how an LED light is ""digital"", but hey - it looks ok and we weren't planning to connect it to the LAN or anything.Good toaster."
1,It was great until it stopped working.,"This toaster worked well until, after 3 months it stopped working. Now I find that the company is out of business."
2,Will Never Buy Haier Again!,"I purchased this toaster about 4 months ago after much research. It worked great. Toasted evenly, allowed for large bread, and bagels even fit in with ease. All of a sudden after a low amount of use over the last 4 months, the toasting lever will not stay down. The only way to get toast is to manually sit there and hold it down. I called Haier customer service and they stated that they would replace the unit for free - great I thought. But at the end of the call, I was told that I had to pay shipping of the old unit to them and include a check for $14.99 for return shipping of the new unit to me. Why am I paying about $25.00 because of their defective product??!!!! Horrible customer service. Will never purchase another Haier product again."
1,Didn't last,"We bought this toaster about 6 months ago and it is serving us very well. The controls are easy to read and adjust. We have people who like their toast closer to warm bread and people who like it close to burnt and this toaster works for every one. I especially like the feature that allow bread or buns to be set up above the elements and heated through or mildly toasted.July, 2011 update, the toaster has stopped making toast. It now makes warm bread, very disappointed that it only lasted 1 year and 4 months."
1,worked for ~4 months....,"I purchased this toaster in June. It started out great, but over time one end of the toast was always getting burned so you had to rotate it half way through. This morning it just stopped working. Needless to say, I will not purchase another one. I haven't tried their Customer Service yet, but from the reviews it does not look hopeful."
1,Broken out of the box,"This toaster was completely broken when we took it out of the box--didn't heat up or turn on, level wouldn't stay down, nothing. Looks pretty, but complete failure out of the box."
2,Dont buy this TV for the following reasons.,"As mentioned in another review, the lamp has a limited life, I got more than the other reviewer, 5yr, but its still $200 and some inconvienence to replace, not the replacment itself but getting the part to the TV.Another problem I've noticed is that the audio quality is very poor. Either too muffled or female news comentator voices too tinny. I always though Sony audio would be outstanding but this is not. I have to run the audio through the stereo to get acceptable sound.It's very unlikely that this TV is available anymore as Sony dropped it ASAP."
3,A Great TV with a catch!,The TV is great great picture quality and great features. It's everything you want plus more. There is one catch through which is that because this is a LCD tv the lamp burns out and you must replace it every year which i have to do. The lamp costs 200$ which is alot of money so unless you dont want to pay that and go through the trouble of buying a lamp buy another tv
5,Must have for philes or just fans.,"I have been an X-file's fan for just over two years. When I saw these episodes for the first time, I was hooked; not only for their signifigance in the mythology of the show, but for their theatrical value. They are briliantly written and portrayed in a way that will blow you away. Definitly give them a shot, you won't regret it."
1,You Can Find Cheaper Elsewhere!,"Keep in mind there is 2 different types of IDS LIQUID PROTEIN. There is 42 and 25 Grams. This seller is selling 25 grams at a price that is either the same, or higher then other companies. So don't even bother dealing with their garbage, because your not getting a great deal. It's $23 for the 25 Grams, and you can get 42 Grams for just a bit more elsewhere. And DON'T TAKE 3 BOTTLES A DAY! Do you have any idea how much that would cost you?! It would be at least $160 a month! Use this stuff sparingly!"
3,Get the Gringo,I liked it It was funny and action packed . Mel Gibbons always delivers a good movie even if he is not that good in real life.
2,Get The Gringo,"I love Mel Gibson for his many top notch movies.I just didn't think 'Get The Gringo' was a good movie. It had the setting to be a special Movie, but I feel it was far below Mel Gibson's standards. I think Mel was fine but the screenplay was below average."
4,good,"What's to say it's Mel, He has made this movie for 30 years just in a different package. If you like Mel and acton you will like this"
3,Intertaining,"Another reason not to go to Mexico. After San Francisco, Mexico and Mexico City were my favorite places. Not worth the risk anymore."
4,Mel being Mel,Mel plays a gringo locked up in a Mexican prison and has to survive and make plans to escape. It is an earthy but violent movie yet it does have tender moments. You will not check your watch during this movie and you will probably not be able to figure it out before the ending comes. I rate it a two bagger on the popcorn scale.
4,Good service.....,"Everything as expected, however can understand why this feature went straight to the video market. Was a bit rough in areas and the story line was a bit ""same oh. same oh."""
4,Do I like it??,"I like Gibson so I may be biased a little, but I enjoyed ""Get the Gringo"". Plenty of ""action"" which I always expect from his stuff. His helping a mother and child was good, the ending reminded me a little of ""Payback"", another of my favorites by Mel.All in all, a good, action show."
2,"A Notch Under, Next!","The director of this film was Mel's assistant director on ""Apocalypco"". Mel acted in his directorial debut indicates Mel's loyalty to his crew. This is a well-directed crime (does pay) film with a large unfamilar-looking but impressive Mexican cast and boasts one of the nastiest prison commune ever put on a film. Mel as usual gave everything he has to his film and always a joy and exciting watching him act. This film has a problem. It could be the script. Even with a ""happy"" ending, it doesn't give the viewer a sense of fulfillment after almost 2 hrs of car chase, blood, drugs and gritty life in a Mexican prison. Don't stop Mel, we look forward to your next one!"
5,Very Good.,"If you like Mel Gibson, and a funny show, then this movie is for you. You must watch closely to keep up with the plot, but you will be entertained by this movie. I would recommend this movie."
3,Get The Gringo,In a way I liked this movie but I was disappointed that Mel Gibson played in it I hope he gets his act back like it was.I have almost all of his movies.But this one was not like him.I would have liked the story if some no name played it but I still have it and will show it to who ever wants to watch it.
2,Wanted to like it but didn't.,"Gibson. I really like PayBack and read somewhere this was similar or something like that. Well yes and no. Wanted to like it, really did but it was ""tired"" and just did not hold my interest. Guess it takes more than just Gibson being Gibson. I do not recommend."
3,Just ok,"this is the kind of movie that you watch at home.Very predictable, not very funny, weird plot...Too bad because I like Mel Gibson's work."
3,good movie,Not the best Gibson has done but it had good story line and good action. Streaming quality was excellent and sound very good.
4,The Return of Mel Gibson,"This was the film I was waiting for from Gibson. He had made a couple of interesting turns, but this movie was pure fun. I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this little Mexican romp. It was an interesting story and had plenty of humor and action. The opening sequence really sets the tone. I'm not sure why this didn't not get a national release, because it was one of the better films I saw this summer."
4,Payback II,"I'm slightly annoyed that I wasn't able to finish this movie because my rental time ran out… I got about 80% through the movie, and from what I can tell, it's more or less a sequel to Payback. Not literally, but his character in this movie is nearly identical. I loved Payback."
1,horrible,It was so bad that I couldn't even finish it. Way too much violence & drug use. What happened to great movies like Lethal Weapon?
5,Great fun for older viewers,"Mel Gibson is over the top great in this movie. Lots of action, good gritty story and just plain fun!"
3,Much better than his last detective movie,"Everybody knows the talent Mel Gibson is, Gringo was very good alot of fun to watch in a way reminded me of Payback this is no Payback but it is still good entertaining, very few are worth the 5-6 bucks anymore, this one was worth 5.00. Give it it a not brilliant but better than his last. maniacdog oh yea if you have not seen Payback rent it one of his best."
4,Darn Good,"This is a darn good movie. Get The Gringo is an action flick, with some sort of love interest thing going on there too, but in a criminal sort of way. Mel Gibson has proven well suited to leading man roles where he expresses bursts of pure animalistic rage, and this movie is no exception. The film takes place south of the US border, in a Mexican prison that Mel's character in the movie asks, ""Is this a prison or the world's crummiest mall?"". Splashed with plenty of violence, intermingled throughout are many light hearted moments, comedic angles to an otherwise gritty and hard edged storyline. You've got to hand it to Mel Gibson, he's a superstar for a reason. There is a little bit of Espanol spoken throughout, with subtitles, and in my opinion this movie would also have good appeal in Mexicano households. I liked it a lot. Not as good as Braveheart, but quite a bit better than Lethal Weapon."
2,Get the Gringo,"The seller was excellent, and it arrived on time.The movie wasn't at all what we expected. Was not the Mel Gibson we are familiar with.Would not recommend the movie."
1,Awful Movie,"The story was weak, the filming was very poor, and the acting was not all that great. Not a good choice for me."
5,Another great Gibson flick,This is another great Gibson Film in the spirit of Payback. I am saddened that this never made the theaters but glad to own it.
5,This is a good flick,I think this movie is really good. I thought it was going to be a junk-food-big-stupid-action movie but I was surprised. The action really only starts at act 3 and the first two acts are all character stuff and expanding on the idea of the main character being a 'fish out of water'. I loved Mel Gibson in this and this is a flick that I will be re-watching because it was so fun to watch.
5,Outstanding,This is a great movie. It really puts you in touch with a little reality. It give it two thumbs up. Superb
2,dont recommend,I did not watch all of this movie. The Roku quality was very poor and I became bored quick with the storyline.
2,Too dark,"It was pretty dark and violent. I didn't love it. I thought PAYBACK was much better, it was violent but it was so well done I didn't mind. This one, not so much."
4,Good post breakdown movie,Gibson has a 2nd decent turn after his 'breakdown'. Good story and Gibson brings back some of that old charm. More in the Action genre
2,Payback missing something,"I think Mel Gibson tried to recreate his movie Payback, but this movie was definately lacking something in the entertainment value. I walked out of the room about 20 minutes into it and hubby turned it off about half way through. We just couldn't get into it."
2,Smallest subtitles!,"This movie would have been better if you could easily read the subtitles. If we weren't are on top of the TV, we couldn't see what the characters were saying."
4,"Payback, but older","Payback is probably my favorite Mel Gibson movie, besides Braveheart. This is essentially the same thing- a superb, crafty, anti-hero survivor. Of course, while he doesn't have a whole lot of humanity left, he does find his reason to do something good, and does it. I would say this is better than Payback in a lot of ways. If it wasn't for the fact that it's sorta formulaic for a Mel Gibson movie, I would give it 5 stars."
3,Got the Gringo,"The movie ""Get the Gringo"" wasn't bad, and if viewers like the ""Mad Max"" antihero type, then they may enjoy this feature. I wouldn't necessarily run out and buy the film, but "" Gringo"" is worth a look or two. And if you value your eyesight, don't write a review on an iDevice."
3,"Yeah, get the gringo...",Good Mel action flick. A little slow in the middle and a little unbelievable as far as some of the stunts. But it wasn't the worst action movie I've seen this year.Worth the rental.
3,Good movie too much Mexican dialog,"The movie story line was very good. I had trouble understanding some of the dialog. A lot of the movie dialog is in Mexican (spanish) and that is all right but the subtitling was small and weak in color and all that made it hard to read, other than the weak subtitles I enjoyed the movie a lot even at 3:00am, i did not sleep,The movie kept me awake."
3,If you like Mel,This movie starts of kinda slow but then picks up towards the middle and turnsnput to be a entertaining movie overall. The story is actually good and the acting is also good.
5,Mel Gibson making the kind of movie he does well...,"Great movie. Lots of fun. I'm sure that if you have seen ""Payback"" and liked it.Then you'll like this one. It's way out there but lots of laughs and plenty of action.I don't give a crap one way or the other about Mel's politics. If I did, I wouldn't beable to find any actors I could stand to watch. Face it Hollywood is full of nut jobsbleeding heart liberals and socialists.I liked the movie."
4,Gibsons return!,"Good fun movie, easy to watch fromanywhere. It has funny dialogue, good action, and a fun cast. Interesting enough plot and its not to long, get the gringo is a Mel's return to action!"
3,It's okay,Dragged on a little bit. Mel Gibson did an okay job but it seems like he'll take any acting gig after watching this movie
2,Sub-titles,"I'm sure I would have enjoyed the movie more if I would have watch it on a larger TV. the movie has sub-titles and they were very hard to read on a 21"" TV. I missed a lot."
1,Simply not good,"We tried watching this... got about a half an hour in and just couldn't watch another minute. bad writing, bad directing, bad acting. Sorry, but this one was a flop."
1,Bad,This had to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen Mel was terrible. Maybe the story was true don't know
1,Horrible Movie,"One of the worst movies ever! Gory, graphic unnecessary details. Story line was slow and unclear, bad language, do NOT waste your time like I did watching this movie. Very disappointed in Mel Gibson who used to be one of my faves."
1,No suspension of disbelief,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Poor directing, horrible writing (have you listened to the dialogue?), poor cinematography and an idiotic story.Prosecution rests."
1,Unable to watch,It wouldnt let me watch the movie wheather it was a bad connection or something but i was unable to watch it
1,it stunk,"this movie was so stupid and boring to this day I have not been able to finish watching it, it is time in my life I will never get back. Thanks Mel Gibson."
4,Decent show for one time rental,"I like most of the movies Mel did, not a super original movie, but will keep you entertained for one evening. It has good action scenes and not too much drama."
3,Gringo,Not up to what Mel can and has done. It seemed to me that it lacked a believable story line. It is not a movie that I would ever watch twice.
4,Gibson Is Back,"Did he really ever leave. The guy may be crazy in real life, but I must admit that his films are a guilty pleasure. This film is very entertaining and had an interesting premise. It is always good fun to root for the bad guy."
5,great,love the books give them to little kids.really a great gift thanks so very very very much. Thanks thanks thanks thanks
4,Children's books,"Nice large type & easily understood text & instructions. There weren't as many experiments as I'd hoped, so that was a bit disappointing. Overall it was a good entry level book for a young person (7-10 yrs old) wanting to learn more about rocks & minerals."
2,Take your shoes off,This product is for the ones who likes to take off their shoes to keep warm. So take off your shoes and stay warm the Foot Warming Pad.
2,burns the house down,"The description fails to mention that it can only be used on cement or tile floors or you risk a fire. I think they should have mentioned that, seems important."
3,Not for carpeted or wood floors,"Product works as advertised however there is no hi/lo switch as indicated in at least one review and the description on Amazon does not mention that the device is for placement only on concrete, stone or tile floors. There is a clear admonition found only on the instruction within the box (Do not use on carpeting or wood floors)that leads me to rate this product at only 3 stars for the absence of clarity. If I had known of this limitation I would have looked elsewhere."
4,No Odor - No Problems,"I bought and used mine all last winter, under my computer desk. No smell - happy with the product. But they have recalled an optional Hi-Lo-Off switch for it. Several months ago, long after I received the warmer, they sent me this switch, which I did not order or pay for (to my knowlege) -- puzzling. Now they've sent me an envelope for mailing back the switch for a replacement, at no charge, postage paid."
5,Very Nice Foot Warmer!!! Chazzzzz,I bought this for my Mom. She has always had cold feet. She is toasty warm all over NOW! The winter in Colorado can be very cold and the cost to heat a large room is not cheap!I read the other comments and worried about the rubber smell. Well I plugged in the unit and a little smell on high heat and soon the smell was gone. She never smelled anything and was so happy about her feet/legs >> WHOLE BODY WARM ! HIGH HEAT WAS TO WARM SO I AM GLAD I BOUGHT the $15 switch that allows you high/low and on off settings! BUY it if you know someone that has cold feet!Soooooo glad I found this item!
4,Just warm enough,"My office is on ground level with a concrete floor. During the winter, my feet would be cold to the point that they would ache. A regular space heater was too hot when running under my desk - my feet would sweat when it was on and freeze when it was off. This product is a great solution for me. It keeps my feet warm without making them too hot (I'm using it with my shoes on).I was concerned about the rubber smell others reported being a problem (my wife says I have a bionic nose). There was a mild rubber smell for the first day or two, but there is no smell now.The only minor complaint I have is that the on/off toggle switch is a bit difficult to use with my foot - a larger push button switch would be ideal.I woud recommend this product without hesitation."
3,"No Smell, Could Be Hotter","The manufacturer must have responded to the smell/odor criticisms of this product by turning the heat down on the mats. I purchased two of these for our office, with the temperature controls, so that I could regulate the heat and smell, if necessary. We certainly didn't need to order the temperature controls, as they only stay on high, and even then produce at best a moderate amount of heat. We do keep our office pretty chilly, so if yours is on the warmer side(+65deg.) these may work out just fine for you. Only a very slight hint of a rubber odor when we first used them."
4,Quite pleased,"I was a bit concerned about the odor' issues that some users reported with this electric footwarmer. There were absolutely none, even when accidentally left ""on"" overnight.The rubber surface has shed water (from melting snow) and given my office a significant comfort factor. I am confident that it is a durable product.The price is a touch high. An off/on switch would be nice. These are my only ""less than perfect"" comments."
4,Just right,"I read the reviews that others had posted about the rubber smell but also read what the manufacturer said about fixing this issue so decided to try it anyway. There IS a smell at first but this only lasts a day or two. This mat offers just the right amount of radiant heat for under my desk in the winter. I absolutely love it!!! I sit in a reception area with a lot of incoming traffic and blasts of cold air. A space heater not only gives off too much heat...it's unsightly. I can't say enough positive about this mat. I definately recommend it. If the smell bothers you, you could always put it in the garage or basement for a couple days until the rubber smell ""burns"" off before you put it under your desk."
2,Indus Electric Foot Warming Pad,The mat does not have the odor that so many purchasers experienced ..thank heavens! It is somewhat useful but does not warm your feet in any type of shoes (only bare feet or in socks. It does take a little longer than expected to heat up and the heat appears to be coming mostly from the end with the cord. I use it while sitting at my computer in the basement and I turn it on and off as needed. Without trying another one it is hard to say if this is defective in any way.
2,No Thermostat!!,"This pad heats up nicely but will get too hot if room conditions are too warm, It does not have an adjustable thermostat or an on/off switch. On some winter days it will be to hot to be confortable. Also I've been using it for weeks and it is still giving off rubber fumes!"
2,Smells,"As a foot-warmer, it is top notch.But as other reviewers have mentioned, the product also produces an extremely pungent odor.The smell reminds me most of cat pee. I actually suspected my two frolicsome felines before I was able to conclusively track the source of the smell to the foot heater. The smell is also quite lingering.This might be a great product for a garage or an outdoor work area, but I don't think I'd recommend it for use in bedrooms or other living areas. I wouldn't mind a rubber smell, but this product does not smell like any rubber I've run across in my travels!"
5,Footwarmer,"This product is just what we were looking for and at a price we felt we could afford. The only thing I would like you to think about is...the type of shoes you would have on your feet when using this. It does get very warm...almost to the ""hot"" stage and if you are wearing rubber soled shoes then they may become ""soft"". I recommend that you put a rug under the map and a towel on top of it. This will help to keep from getting even bare or socked feet from getting too hot.There is a ""smell"" when on and it's first new but after a few days of useage it goes away. Just be sure you unplug it after you use it. You don't want to start up a fire if you walk out of the office or if using in your home...go to bed and have it on.All in all....it is a great ""foot warmer"" and we love it on those cold winter days and nights when we are at our computer."
2,Smells like burning tires,"I got this for my wife, and was really looking forward to it. We have different ""temperature preferences"", and she spends much of her time at home complaining about being too cold. That, or I complain about being too hot.Anyhow, the Indus does warm up. In fact, it gets downright hot -- you need socks or something else between you and it once it's going at full tilt. It's a very effective foot warmer.But then there's the smell. Once it gets warmed up, it gives off a powerful smell of hot rubber. The smell doesn't go away very fast once it's turned off, either. In fact, I had to wash the comforter that we'd had over the Indus repeatedly to get rid of the burning rubber smell. The house still smells faintly of hot rubber, and it's been days since we used it.If I had no sense of smell, I'd love the Indus. Unfortunately, as it is, we can't use it. With luck, perhaps Indus can find a material to use that won't react this way upon heating."
1,BEWARE of this product!,"This is the worst product I've ever purchased. The unit, whenever plugged in and used, gives off the most horrible petro-chemical-solvent based fumes I've ever encountered. No one in our household can tolerate the intense fumes, which permeate the entire house within 30 minutes of use causing burning eyes and throat, and intense headaches. Hoping that these odors would subside with time and usage, we plugged the pad in out in the garage and let it ""season"" 24hrs/day for a bit over 3 weeks. Tried it inside again, with the same results as before. Even after a month of aging, the solvent odors are intolerable. I am discarding it, as the health risks to anyone breathing these vapors are unacceptible. To those reviewers who stated they noticed no odors, you must have received a unit manufactured by some other vendor, as this made-in-China heating mat is the most unacceptable -- and dangerous -- consumer product I've ever seen."
1,Not until it arrived did I read anything about NOT putting it on top of carpet,How was I to know that? It was going to be used ontop of indoor/outdoor carpet. The literature that cameWITH the Pad said no to any carpetting. This information did NOT appear online when I placed the order. The product was successfully returned.
1,Not appropriate for in-home use,"This heating mat produces a decent amount of heat - certainly too much to be used without shoes. However, the instructions that come with the mat warn to not use it on wood or carpeted floors despite the fact that the Amazon product image shows it being used on a wood floor under a desk. No warnings about the floor types appear on Amazon. Furthermore, the rubber odor is awful and the mat out of the box was quite greasy. This produce appears to be more suited to an industrial environment and is not suitable for in home or office use. I'm going to follow up with some of the other reviewers' suggestions and get a heated pet pad instead."
4,Second one of these for me.,I have enjoyed one of these under my desk for a couple of years but it stopped working so I purchased a new one. I hadn't remembered the smell so I ignored some of the comments from other purchasers. It was definitely a stinker for the first week. A very intense hot tar like smell.The smell has disappeared now and it's still working so I am happy with the product.
3,Gets the job done,"I have a basement office so I wanted something that would keep my feet warm under my desk in the Winter when the temperature at floor level is coldest. This is the only item I found that allowed me to wear my regular shoes, not have my feet tethered to something and had a reasonably large size for foot placement. The drawbacks: The On/Off switch is on the cord and will be on the floor and under the desk unless you plug it into a power strip that you can reach in a more convenient place. The device after awhile will make your feet ""to hot"" . You will likely find that you need to manually cycle it On/Off to keep your feet truly comfortable. Finally, I have some question as to the long term durability of this item. This is the second one I have purchased. The first one simply ceased working during the second winter. I have purchased a second simply because I could not find anything else as convenient to use."
1,Acrid smell!,"I opened the package and left the box in the house, to run the mat in the garage as another reviewer suggested. Later the smell from the box alone wafted through 3 rooms, and I had to put it in the garage. I left it running 12 hours, by which time my garage smelled absolutely awful, and the house was permeated just by opening and closing the door. I just had to unplug it - we couldn't stand it. I actually thought that maybe I had hit a skunk with my car, but when we unplugged the mat, boxed, and bagged it, the smell went away. It heated up really nicely, but there's no way to live with the smell. Maybe they use different rubber sources for different batches??"
5,Indus-Tool Cozy Electric Foot Warming Pad is worth EVERY CENT,"If your floor is cold and your feet are cold and your shoes are cold this will help! The pad doesn't run Hot like a space heater. If that's what you want, buy a space heater. It should be used to boost comfort in an area with cold floors. Specifically under your desk or computer desk.1. Use this foot warmer (if very cold use a space heater till you warm up some.2. Take off shoes and put on pad - upside down3. Put sock feet on pad4. Wait till feet feel warm5. Wait till shoes feel warm on the inside6. Put shoes back on (if you feel you must wear shoes)7. Turn off space heater and continue using foot warmer padRemember-- The foot warmer is NOT A SPACE HEATER. If you want a space heater BUY A SPACE HEATER. If you want to maintain or warm up your feet, USE THIS PRODUCT and you will be very happy!"
3,"Fantastic heat, can't use on carpet or wood floor!","The unit heats amazingly. Actually it gets too hot and really should have 2 heat settings. Also the instructions say do not put it on a wood or carpet floor? Really?! It's really designed to be a shoe drying unit which would work well in a mud room, garage, or entry with a tile floor. But I need a foot warmer. My unit did not have any smell issues that others had, and am very sensitive to smells. Good unit but the description should state it can't be used on carpet wood."
2,too hot,My main problem with this heated mat is that it does not have an on and off switch. It also tends to get too hot when left a while.
3,Stinky Stinky Stinky like a skunk! But it works really well,"I wonder if the smell will ever diminish as the rubber ages. Perhaps, but the rubber will probably dry and crack by that time, too.Meanwhile, you have the choices of: (1) ignore the smell, (2) open the window (sorta defeats the purpose of having a heater), or (3) use another heating source.But as for its intended function, it works just fine. And if your feet are comfortable ...."
4,Keeps feet toasty,"I wanted something to keep my feet warm when I sit in front of my computer. I don't like wearing socks, and my dog won't sit still long enough to help keep my feet warm. I've kept my eye on this product since last year and finally bought it a few weeks ago. The best price I found is right here on Amazon. When you first plug it on, the gradual warmth is especially nice. After it reaches the maximum heat, it gets pretty hot with bare feet. Most people, I would think wear socks and they should feel very comfortable. I'm happy with the product, bare feet and all. It doesn't give off any smell that some complain about. Of course, the main reason I'm especially happy with this product is the low wattage. I wish there was a switch to turn it off and on instead of plugging and unplugging. It would be nice too, if you could adjust the temperature. Nevertheless, overall, I'm happy with this product. I give it a four star."
4,It has its place,"This is the second foot warming pad I have purchased from you. The first was four years ago. Both have worked perfectly and kept my feet warm while working on a cold floor. The only drawback is the skunky, burnt-rubber smell. If you are in an individual office with limited air flow, it will be unbearable. I now work in a cube farm, so there is no detectable odor at all. Previously, I had one in a 9 x 12 office with a high ceiling and good air flow. In that situation, the odor was noticeable (but not objectionable) for about a month, then went away. My mom wanted to try my new one in her small shop that has almost no air flow--she couldn't breathe. Your cold feet will love it in any situation, and your nose will be happy too, if you work in a large airspace."
3,"Works Great, But Could Be More User Friendly","If you are in a place where the general air temperature is fine, but the air down around your legs and feet is quite cold, then this is the product for you. It gets warm and stays warm. (In fact, it gets really warm - I put a piece of carpet remnant under it to protect the floor and 2 hand towels on top of it to protect my feet!)But, it could be better. It must be turned on and off by plugging and unplugging; this is a pain. I cut the cord about 6 inches from the pad and installed a simple rotary swich like you find on some table lamp cords. If I did it again, I would install a foot switch like you find on some floor lamps.Also, there is no pilot light so it is easy to go off and leave it turned on; not good.Maybe I can find a cord switch with a little neon lamp.Still, it does what it is supposed to."
2,stinky warm,I should have respected other reviews but was hopeful the smell problem was fixed. It's not. I'm not overly sensitive to odors but this actually makes my eyes burn after a while. It's bearable for a quick warm up but not to leave on more than 5-10 minutes. Probably not good for my already feeble brain.
5,"WOW, really nice","I got this for my 84 year old mom to keep her feet warm when she sits in front of the TV. This is soooo nice, I am ordering another one today to keep at my work table for my feet. This just makes you FEEL GOOD, in this cold winter weather."
3,It's OK,"Maybe my expectations were wrong, but I expected to be able to feel the warmth radiating upwards from under my desk. Without my shoes on, it is quite warm but with shoes on, I am at work afterall, I barely feel the heat.And, as to the smell? It has not dissipated at all. I thought the building had been sprayed by a skunk when I walked back into my office after lunch. The first few days, I figured it would go away, but two weeks later I can still smell it. Ick!"
4,It is what it is -- cheap and functional,"Heats up your feet and employs basic laws of thermodynamics (heat rises) to keep the rest of you reasonably warm. It's ugly and strictly functional, but uses about 1/15 the energy of most space heaters. I use it in an unheated home office, and periodically find myself putting my hands under the desk to keep them comfortable on very cold days, but for the price -- both initial and long-term (considering energy consumption) I have absolutely no complaints. Smells like a rubber mat, which is what it is."
1,Eau de Gas Station,"I just bought one of these and I really regret it. Reading the reviews I thought, ""Oh, well, some people say they smell and others say they don't.. Maybe I'll get lucky.""I smelled the stinky smell - no joke - before I even opened the box. Now the room in which I have it smells like a gas station.If you love the smell of tires, then this is the product for you!PS: The photo for this product is not what I received, which is bigger and worse-looking, though still, yes, a black rubber mat, and roughly the same idea."
4,warm feet at last,This pad is ugly but really does the job. It exudes a little bit of a rubber smell when it is first turned on. All worthwhile. It doesn't have an easy to read switch so its hard to tell immediately whether its on or off. But soon it is quite warm and wonderful for the feet.
2,Skunk smell is right!,Nasty nasty nasty. This thing smells exactly like a skunk. We couldn't figure out the smell at first as it filled a hallway and a second room with the stink. The thing is now three weeks old and despite being washed several times with 409 spray cleaner and left outside for a week in the sun it still stinks to high heaven. What were they thinking when they came up with the formula for this rubber?It does keep my feet warm so one star for each warm foot.Two years later and the smell still lingers! My wife will not let the thing in the house.
3,works ... gets pretty hot,Instructions said not for outdoor use. It's being used on an enclosed outdoor porch to keep the water from freezing. It works for that just fine.
3,it is helpful but the setting is too high,This is a helpful product and I have not detected any smell from it so far. My only complaint is that the thermostat it claims it has is apparently set too high and there is no way to change it: in about ten minutes it gets too hot for a foot in a sock and I have to turn the thing off then wait till it cools off then turn it back on and so on. Kinda frustrating to keep doing that.
4,It works,The pad works just fine; it's a simple device that can be easily moved to where you are sitting. I bought the Hi/Lo switch many reviewers mentioned. It also works fine and I think you need it especially if you are wearing just socks.It's not complicated - it works!
2,good for the outside,"not for inside use, IMHO. It stinks, like a skunk. but outside, to melt the ice on a front step, it's great"
1,Cozy Foot Warmer smells terribly,"The foot warmer produces terribly strong rubber smell. My office and surrounding hall area stunk when the mat was in, so that I was requested to remove it from my office. Looking for an odorless alternative."
2,Sweet n' Sour,"It's a cold winter, and I'm sick of dealing with cold feet. It has really started to effect my quality of life. I decided to try out the cozy footwarmer. It does get very warm, indeed. It gets too warm to leave your feet/socks on it. It works very well with your shoes on, making it ideal for the office. The heat is strong enough to warm the entire shoe. I can feel the radiant heat on my lower legs through my pants. It does heat extremely well, and I love it for that. I give it a an A+ for function!However, it does emit a very strong odor. The fumes in the rubber are quite potent. I had it under my desk, and the fumes would irritate my eyes, nose, and sinuses. My office mate and I got mild headaches, as a result of the volatiles in the rubber. The fumes should dissipate after time. I plugged it in at a ventilated area to let it vaporize the volatiles in the rubber. I will revisit this thread to give you all a progress report. It gets 2 stars for now...Hope this helps."
2,smell is already getting better BUT ...,"this thing is too darn hot! I just received this as a gift, and I definitely needed it - I'm always cold and I sit at my computer alot, so my feet get cold, too. As a person who likes to be really warm (hot showers, snuggle up by the gas heater, etc), I was surprised to find that this mat gets too hot for me. Even through rubber-bottomed bedroom shoes.It's got the right idea, but a way to adjust the temperature is needed. Prehaps I can wire this up to a dimmer switch or something. If not, I might end up sending it back.Currently, I've got my digital candy thermometer between my foot and the mat and it's reading 127 degrees F and climbing. 129 ... 133 ... 135. Merely a bit warmer than body temperature should suffice! I'd guess 110 degrees should be plenty warm. Now I'm up to 136 ... 138 ... 140 - maybe I have a defective unit?!? I should probably get up before I melt my bedroom shoes!"
3,Requires a lamp dimmer for reasonable operation.,"I have used this for almost a month in my basement work room and have nice warm feet when I sit at the computer.Having read the reviews about the smell and being too hot, I have used it with a lamp dimmer from the beginning. I set it about midway, and the warmth is about right with shoes and still not too hot with just socks. Also there is very minimal smell. It heats very slowly, so turn it up gradually. If you are into electrical work, you could use a wall dimmer in an electrical box, and that would give you a switch, too.Three stars may be a bit stingy, but this would be a dynamite product if it had even a simple thermostat and a switch.I recommend it IF you use it with a dimmer."
1,Dangerous. Overheated.,"I bought one of these heating mats and it worked pretty good, so I bought a second. The second had a serious overheating problem. I had on slippers and two pair of socks and it got too hot. I tried it without the slippers and could only put my foot with the socks on, on the mat for 1/2 second. Likewise my hand.The mat needs a breaker or a fuse on it to prevent such overheating if the thermostat or design of the heating elements fail as they did on the 2nd one.Again this mat would be very dangerous for an older person, a sick person, someone who fell asleep, etc.I can not stress the danger enough enough."
1,Either I got a completely different product or those 5 star reviewers all live in Florida.,"This was a total waste of $36. Maybe in bare feet this would be **slightly** warm but even if I put my bare hand on it after it has been ""warming"" for several hours I still can't feel much heat.Go find some other product to buy if you really want your feet warmed, this is useless for that purpose."
4,Heated floor mat,Keeps your feet nice and warm. I use it under my desk at work. I just wish it had a temperature control switch - it actually gets too hot. There is no odor what so ever. No one at work knows I have it.
1,disappointing solar product,"I bought this fountain and live in CO where sun is intense most of the time. It clogs easily and stops working. I did solve this by wrapping the bottom of the pump with leftover filtering material from our cut to fit furnace filter, but it only lasted about a year and the solar panel no longer works. When it works it is a nice little fountain...but be prepared to have it die after a season."
2,lily pump,"i bought several of these from various dealers, at one time. i have one left after 1 yr. pumps went bad, solar panel goes bad. the unit when working is cool. but for the money, not so cool! i do believe the problems lies in the solar panel.these were brought in over the winter also.le"
1,Hey Mr. DJ won't you turn this music off?,"Sometimes I feel I've got to (clap clap) run away I've got to (clap clap) get away from the pain you drive into my ear canals.Okay, here's the formula:Pop tart that sounds like Miss Cleo trying to sing stealing a title from Bjorn and Benny's canon as well as a Vanilla Ice caliber wholesale lifting of one of the melodies of one of the greatest songs of the 1980s? Probably go down a storm with the Radio Disney crowd, but not this cynical old b@st@rd. I can't forget what I know and I know this is a joke.I cannot stand the way you tease.Signed,Marc Almond, er-- epsteinsmutha"
2,Help This Song,"There are just so many songs now or days that sample great music from the past, and seems to turn it into pudding. That has been the problem with so many acts like Jennifer Lopez, Ashanti, and now Rihanna. Her latest single, S.O.S., samples the 80's classic Soft Cell's Tainted Love. Rihanna's track doesn't really have the feeling of a great dance song here. It just sounds terrible. While her last singles Pon De Replay, and If It's Lovin' That You Want were fairly welcomed guilty pleasure tracks, this song doesn't capture a new singer in their prime. I think she needs to try to find better songs to make her appeal more known.Song: D+"
1,below generic singer,This Rihanna girl can't sing. I can't believe this song is a hit. The sound isn't even hers. The whole sound of S.O.S. was taken from another artist who did tainted love from the 80's. This girl is just an airbrushed fake musical artist. The funny thing is when a black male/female singer borrows (which happens a lot with black singers)the sound or vocals from another artist's classic hit no one says anything but when a white artist does this (which doesn't happen frequently) everyone is all over the white singer from the media to buying consumers. What's the deal with that??? This needs to stop.
1,Give me a break!,"Rihanna? How about Barf? Try re-winding 15 years to the 1991 hit from Soft Cell. What a horrible attempt at a knock-off. Sorry, club bangers."
3,I like SOS!,"My rating is only three stars, because this is the only song I've heard by Rhianna.I am in my 40s. I remember Soft Cell's version, which of course, they took from an even older version. So what if this song samples Soft Cell's rendition? I think there's room for both! Both songs are good in different ways. People need to be a little more tolerant."
5,JASON NEVINS!!!,"Rihanna's ""SOS"" is THE summer anthem, and Jason Nevins turns it into an 80s-styled stomper! W2G Mr. Nevins! Oh, and the album version's good too."
4,Nice Product... Here's More Description,"...This is a special adapter that allows someone to mount their existing Quick-Grip vise mounting plate to a Workmate. So, you need to use the mount that comes with the vise and attach it to your workmate with this adapter. It screws through one of the dog holes in the Workmate. On my Workmate, I needed to drill a new hole for this purpose as the existing holes were a *little* too far from the edge to mount the vise without forcing it.It is well made of black, fiber reinforced plastic. It is an adapter plate with a threaded plastic bolt that goes through a hole in the Workmate and is held on with a textured nut made of the same material."
4,Loved the movie. Happy to have gotten a tape.,"This movie is kind of a cult classic, just not enough for a DVD issue :(There was a surprisingly wide variety of prices I could have paid for this tape, from ~$10 to >$100.I went for one of the least expensive offers and got a tape with slight audio muffling and some videofuzz at the top of the screen. For what I could have paid, I am satisfied."
3,Not enough!,"I always wanted to know if there was a film made from the classic novel ""One hundred years of solitude"", and this is it! The only problem is that this is only a part of the book.This film was not what I expected, but it kept me entertained."
5,book,"excellent reference for both professionals and parents who need exercise ideas. very clear, simply illustrations. must have for OTs/PTs who work work with kids/infants"
1,I received a used set.,I'm very disappointed that Amazon sent me a very used set. Finger prints everywhere and dull with scratches on the handles. Dirty oil/grease in the creases. Can't give this as gift because it is used.
3,Nice gift,Since the price was low on these the other day i picked up one for me and my father. they make a great gift he loved it and they sure are well made.My problem with the screwdriver is that the finish is so slick that it slides in my hand. quick fix is i used some 80 grit sandpaper to rough it up alittle.as for the knife no problems there other then it is heavier then the blue sheffield knife i already had so i will be carrying around the blue one and leave this in my truck.
3,"Nicely done, but the knife is hard to open","These are really nicely finished, but opening the knife is a 2 handed affair. Oil didn't make a difference either. If you've got to pull it out of your pocket and then tug with your other hand on the blade holder it makes the tool much less useful. (I bought 2 of these sets and neither knife can be opened with the opening stud alone).I do like the screwdriver. Reminds me of my grandfather's tools."
2,Not heavy duty,I got these as a free bonus with a purchase. At first I really liked them and I thought they were decent quality. The bits on he driver were very cheap and ended up chipping without alot of use. I figured oh well the knife is still nice. Well after about a month of light use ( mainly cutting tape packing tape ) the knife broke. It started to spread apart and then the rivit that holds it together just fell out. It was nice to be able to carry it around in your pocket but I just wish they made it a little better. It may look antique but it was definatly not of antique quality more like dollar store junk.
3,Tools that do what they're required,"These tools work well for their intended purposes, though there are some markings on the metal and wood of the handles. Unfortunately, they do not come with protective cases like the other 3 piece Sheffield Antique Tool Set. Great price for solid tools."
1,shoddy on the inside,"Received the screwdriver as a gift.. Great to look at, brass and wood, but the insert that holds the barrel of the screwdriver is low grade potmetal and fell apart, leaving the screwdriver wobbly and unstable. A couple of pennies spent on better materials would have resulted in a beautiful and enduring product."
5,Outstanding Value!!!,"This is a very good set especially for the money. The knife is rock solid and has a feel of top quality. The screwdriver has the same feel but has less moving parts so it is less apparent. The knife has a very good belt clip that holds it securely on a belt. The blade is very easy to change but is held in securely. The knife had a few very light surface scratches that you can hardly see. They can easily be buffed out if you plan on using it for a display model. My screwdriver had a few larger scratches on the little name plate that says ""Sheffield"". I plan on buying another just to leave in the garage and maybe buy one for each of my brothers."
3,Enchantment or Disapointment?,"I've finished reading this book yesterday and only today i read this critics trying to find out more on the book. I must say i now have a mixed feeling in a sense of being cheated, because i really liked the book, assuming from the beggining that this was a real journal...There are several events Hollywood type (like Estance), but since they are mixed with believable descriptions, i must say i fell for it... The thing that surprised and at the same time enjoyed me was in fact the ""modern"" mind that Roger had, and to see what where the thoughts of someone in the Crusade, even if he was ahead of his time, i only can say it is sad to find out that its only fiction. Anyway, its a good book to read, i only wished like other readers expressed here, that the author shouldn't have adopted this marketing strategy to sell it..."
4,Gripping story,"I half expected a documentary style, historical novel siting dates, times, references. NOT SO. Unexpectedly, I was drawn into a real life story that I JUST HAD to finish. Very much a 'page turner'. It is a very believable story, and I, like others thought it might be true. I don't know... Very detailed, day to day life of a crusader. Excellent non Hollywood finish - more like real life. A good read, highly recommend."
4,great fiction,"As a history buff, I found this book extremly engaging. I thought the book at first to be nonfiction, but it is not. Even as a work of fiction, I believe it gave a halfway decent picture of the times and what the soliders may have been feeling. I thought it was a great book!"
5,Fact or Fiction,"I really enjoyed this book, it was gripping reading from the start, at first I believed it was a true account of the period but as I got further into the book it became obvious that it was only a story, there were many historical facts that at that time would have been impossible to achieve especially the time of travel they must have all been marathon runners, But all in all a good read alot of time and energy must have gone into the research."
4,"Fact or Fiction, Really an Issue?","This book had me stuck in my room for several days. Like other readers, I am intrigued in Roger's genuine background. Unfortunately there is no mention of him in any academic texts, and Stephen Runciman denies knowledge of this gentleman. That is not to say whether he is factual or not. Was is factual is the author's brilliant analysis of the First Crusade and his attention to detail is astounding, even to the point of mentioning the devinely inspired goose. Fact or fiction, this book paints the best picture of the crusades I have come across, bringing the era to life in a way that other authors have failed to."
4,A good though imperfect read,"First, I have to address the ""is this real?"" question. Does it not state on the cover of the book that this is a NOVEL of the Crusades? By definition, a novel is: A fictional prose narrative of considerable length, typically having a plot that is unfolded by the actions, speech, and thoughts of the characters. So there's your answer, right in the title.Anyhow, back to the book. I finished it tonight and mostly enjoyed it. I agree with others who found the couple of plot twists a little Hollywood. I did find Roger's struggle with his faith, morality, etc. realistic and disagree with those who feel that everyone from a certain age behaved and believed the same way. If that were true, we'd still be living in the middle ages. For a great non-fiction read, I recommend William Manchester's A World Lit Only By Fire; for more novels, try Cecelia Holland's Great Maria or Jerusalem."
1,History with an agenda,"Maybe it's premature to review the book(e) before I actually finish it--- but I might not finish it at all. I just wanted to let potential buyers know that, beyond the author's moral agenda (the first crusade was a shameful and horrific event---GRANTED, already. Who defends it?), he plays fast and loose with history and chronology. Much is out of place and out of character with the historical record--- and I'm only a third of the way through it.As to the agenda, I don't need a heavy-handed Hollywood-type history lesson. Give me the facts; I'm qualified to make up my own mind.Cecelia Holland and Judith Tarr have told this story better. For history, I'll stick to Runciman or the newer guys, like Asbridge."
1,Truly dreadful,"You have to ask yourself what the point of this book is. It isn't a faithful account of the events, the people or the emotions and motives of the people who went on the crusade. It grates as a story because it reads like 20th century man (with all his preconceptions) dropped into smack into the middle ages. It fails as a novel because the only imagination on the part of the author is to corrupt the historical reality. There are several genuine historical accounts that were written by real people that actually went on the crusade. If you're interested in the story, read them first."
1,This book was a HUGE disappointment,"I have read lots of historical fiction. This was extremely vile historical fiction. This was more of one man's excuse to write about his fictional ancestor's sexual romps through Europe during the first Crusades. Lord Roger observes sex, has sex, talks about sex and thinks about sex. Oh, and there's also some references to the Crusades. Excessive in lust, violence, and carnal language. Lots of great research on the author's part, I'm sure, but all wasted as it's sandwiched in between very gratuitous descriptions of every type of sex! Some historical potential in there, but dusgusting to read."
4,"I loved it, but....","This book is probably one of the best accounts of the First Crusade ever made. I devoured it as it took me on the long trip from Western Europe to far-away Jerusalem. I sympathised with the characters as they treaded on territory totally unknown to them. I do have some complaints which I believe many have against this book. That is, that some parts of this book are just so unreal and, I think, could only come from an author's imagination. Roger, the main character seems too much of a tolerant, faithful, honest, goody-goody two shoes. Not to mention when his dead friend appears in the guise of his servant; that, I thought, was a bit much. I consoled myself by thinking that Roger was slowly slowly becoming mad, thus causing him visions or some sort of hallucinatory experiences. Or he could just have let his fantasy take flight, after all, it is HIS book. In any case, fact or fiction that it is, I read this book with much gusto."
3,"Would you like to be cheated, Mr Rivele?","As many arround the world I bought this book as being a genuine diary of a lost crusader for there is nothing in the book indicating that one is actualy reading a novel.Therefore I went on with my reading presuming I was facing an incredible important historical document. Roger had a very peculiar mind for a midlle age man, but one must assume that there have always been some men ahead of his time, but there are limits... And what about the many mistakes? Boehmund was not a short man he is described in arab chronics as a blond giant and they should know because he was captured and held in prison for a few months. And what should we say about that poor arab woman that was about to marry the emir's son? Please! Mr Rivele you haven't done your homework properly and in your next book will you please be so kind as to state clearly its nature?"
1,Why confuse fact with fiction?,"Like the other reviewers, I'm having trouble deciding if the story is really fact or fiction. I was convinced at first it was fact, but the further I get in the book, I'm not sure.If it is fiction, why the factual ""ruse""? I think I would have read it either way, but I, too, am distracted by trying to figure out if this is really how someplace looked or someone acted.If it is fiction, are all the professors, etc. acknowledged in the preface also made up? I don't like this trend (I first saw it in ""The Bridges of Madison County"") where a preface claims a book is true, but it isn't. I much prefer books like ""My Antonia"" which claims to be a recollection but we know from the beginning it's not.I think Mr. Rivele has been working with Oliver Stone too much. <g"
1,a piece of junk,"if you're interested in a skype/landline phone that works forget this. we literally threw ours out. on the landline, calls came in so low in volume one could not hear. using skype, calls were bearly acceptable and one incurred a huge hum & distortion of the audio on every call not applicable to skype. another negative is you must go through your pc to utilize skype.we replaced this piece of garbage with a philips voip8411 b37. it operates flawlessly without requiring a pc."
3,Not for family use,"The Good: Links with Skype and your landlineThe Bad: The controls are sluggish, everyone has a hard time dialing numbers and screams at the poor thing.If you don't use Skype that often and have a landline phone, don't buy it. My family doesn't like it, so shouldn't yours."
1,Horibble,"I got the phone and set it up with ease. To find that it needed a usb cable and software was unexpected and only complicates things. When you want to make a call you need your computer on and skype running. I had to set my skype settings and use the skype program in my computer to select who i wanted to call, And was unable to find my skype contacts in the phone to call someone. It made my computer and internet very slow and having a Quad Core, 4 Gig's of ram, etc this isn't normal. When i unplugged the device from my computer, everything sped back up again."
1,Returning to headset on Skype,"This product needs more work. Mine was purchased in February 2008. Loading the software on a Vista OS machine (which may have contributed to the problem), the 2 in 1 never fully connected with Skype; example: my contact numbers did not make it onto the handset viewing screens. On Telco standard phone lines, the handsets noticeably clipped the low-volume portions of inbound calls, to the point that folks would have to repeat statements to be understood. Using the handset speaker was a partial work-around, but not always appropriate. Not effective in my judgement; I returned my unit."
1,Don't waste your money,"I received this for Christmas. After letting the batteries charge for a day, we installed the software and plugged the phone in. The handset would not talk with the base unit. Basically, the phone was defective. After a very disappointing/frustrating conversation with ""tech support"", we ended up giving the gift back to the person that gave it to us. Don't waste your money on this phone."
2,GE 2 in 1 Internet Phone,"I bought this phone a couple of years ago. I had absolutely NO problems with the Skype portion of the phone at all. Everything worked beautifully. The issue with the phone was the landline portion. I found that regular landline calls made with the phone were not very clear. I couldn't always hear what people were saying to me. It's like the volume would drop on its own. So, I stopped using the phones. Today, I decided to give them another try with Windows 7 OS. After downloading a firmware update the Skylink software and the hardware were recognized. Again, the Skype portion works well. The landline is still doing the same thing it always did. I can't hear some people very well at all when making a regular landline call. So, I guess I'm putting them away again. Too bad. It's a great looking little phone and works well in every way but making regular (landline) phone calls."
1,I DO NOT recommend this.,"I bought this about 2 years ago. I really regret buying it. It is the worst item which I have bought in Amazon. I can not believe it is still in sale, even with that price! When you call by using Skype, you should turn on your computer. How stupid this is! It has 2 functions, Internet phone & standard one. I really hope it can just have an average 'STANDARD PHONE' performance. Though I gave up the internet phone just after I bought it, it didn't work good as the standard phone. Too noisy! I couldn't hear the caller well. I should buy another standard phone at BEST BUY with my wife's severe complaint. I will never recommend this!"
2,poor choice,"This phone is TERRIBLE!! I mean the voice quality is okay, but if the phone is plugged into the USB port on your computer it disables the sound....which defeats the purpose. I'd rather use my headset than this phone and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Unless you don't mind not having sound on your PC. I'll give it one thumb up and one thumb down."
1,Zero stars,Can't review the product since I never received it. Seller did not reply to second email. Filed a claim with Amazon. Still awaiting an answer/refund. Perhaps seller can reply to my review.
1,Unoriginal and Overrated,"I don't know why most people adulate this book and even its predecessor. I read both this book - More Effective - and Effective C++. Ninety percent of the materials in this book can be found in Stroustrup's The C++ Programming Language. This book is like a summary of Stroustrup's aforementioned book. After reading this book, I gained no new insights on C++ programming. If you really want a good C++ book, read Modern C++ Design and Exceptional C++. Don't waste your money on this Effective C++ crap. It's unoriginal and overrated. I wish that I can give this book zero stars."
1,A crass attempt to sell a book that people don't really need,"Why do we need to buy Two books on effective C++ tips (the version with 35 tips and the version with 50 tips) when one entire book would be more practical. Worst of all, Scott Meyers could have remedied this with his 1997 version, but instead he merely revised his 1992 version according to the new C++ standard."
4,Excellent book which is up-to-date with the latest C++ Std.,"This book differs from '50 ways' in two primary ways: First, it is much more up-to-date with respect to the C++ standard. Second, its topics tend to be of a more ""strategic"" than ""tactical"" nature and are discussed in greater depth.Where it is similar is in the way that Meyers makes liberal use of example code to explain not just the ""doctrine"" but the nature of the problems which need to be overcome and the various less suitable alternative approaches.As a c++ neophyte (but 20 year programmer), when I first read this book after having read its predecessor, I felt that it wasn't as useful or as immediately applicable. However, having acquired some months of experience putting to use the excellent advice of the first book, I find myself re-reading this book for more detailed discussions of the language and its use.I would very much like to see a third volume from Meyers dealing solely with the new C++ Standard Template Library."
5,"Good book, easy to read","I find Scott's books to be very easy to read and also very insightful as well. If you like reading about programming and C++ then you'll enjoy his writing style and topic selection. Many of the code examples are a bit too simplistic and underdeveloped but they otherwise convey the message author intends. I've read all three of his books and found this one to be the best one. Although 50 tips may seem like a lot more than the 35 offered in this one, I believe you'll find this one to be more useful."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK!!,"Scott meyers covers quite a few ways to stop yourself from hanging yourself. He shows you what you might be tempted to do, then shows you why you shouldn't do it! Tons of examples on how to fix the problem areas of C++!! GREAT BOOK!"
5,SImply the best book on advanced C++,This book is a must if you want to take yourself from a beginner to a more intermediate C++ programmer.
5,"It's Meyers...if you haven't read it and you're programming C++, you already should have read it!","Effective version two-point-oh. Meyers' authoring style is as sound as his advice. Learn it, live it, love it. You can't go wrong with this book."
5,"Excellent product, easy to install","I have lately got to the age where I am a bit unsteady and need safety bars in my bathroom. After breaking my foot slipping while getting out of the tub, and having to wear a cast for a month, it was time so I finally bought this product, the 32"" bar in white, and also two smaller bars, two of the 12"" bars. Easy to install with my cordless screwdriver. Plenty of screws come with the product and also gaskets to keep water from getting under the edge of the bar. The bars look great (white, in my green and white bathroom) and I feel more secure holding onto my bars which are mounted so securely that I can put my full weight onto them. My conclusion is that these safety bars are a wise investment and they look fine as well. Recommended for all. Get them before you fall and break something like I did. I'm lucky only breaking my foot."
2,"not 1 1/2"" grab bar","Contrary to the description for this item, the box for the grab bar is clearly labeled as 1 1/4"" and the grab bar in fact is 1 1/4"" not 1 1/2"", which does make a difference. Otherwise an okay grab bar."
3,Basic Grab Bars,These are straight forward grab bars. The do not come with any instructions for installation...especially a problem for ceramic tile or fiberglass.
4,Grab bar solution for the bath,"With my wife coming home from physical rehab, I needed to install some grab bars in the bathroom. I looked in the big box store, and the little box store, and found a bewildering assortment. They were all high priced.Decided to check Amazon. Of course, they had them. I bought one 32 inch barMedline 32 Inch Grab Bar, Knurled Chrome, and two 12 inch bars for a fraction of the price that the box stores wanted.Installation was simple. Just find two studs and screw in the screws. The 12 inch bars were mounted vertically, so I didn't even look for the second stud.PRO: High quality construction with a knurled grip surface. Well made, well thought out.CON: Mounting screw heads are soft. They will strip out if you aren't careful.NEUTRAL: Mounting screws are exposed. Not a problem, just a preference thing."
5,A must have safety device,I installed these in the bathroom of my weekend get away so my mother could get in and out the tub safely. I feel much better knowing there is less chance of her or any of us falling.
3,The picture is misleading!,"The grab bar seems to be of fine quality but beware of the photograph and, for that matter, the description of the product listed here. The photo shows MULTIPLE grab bars and the description refers to BARS, plural.In fact, only one is delivered once you place the order.That said, the bar that came seems to be of high quality. I just felt as though I'd been misled."
1,Miserable customer service experience,"This is the only less than pleasant experience that I've ever had with Amazon. This item was shipped without installation hardware, although the 16"" bar in the same order was complete; furthermore, the shipping paper work included in the package was for a totally different order, placed by someone else at a different address. I sent an email to customer service and received a reply from someone in India whose command of English is apparently borderline. He totally misunderstood the situation (in three different ways!) and I just decided to forget about it and mark it up to experience. Incidentally, if he/she had done the logical thing I would have been sent the needed hardware, but, as the confusion even involved thinking the problem was with the wrong item the solution would have been useless."
4,A visual book,"Medical Terminology is a great book for visual learners, It has a lot of pictures labeling important terms. It's a well organized book. It has exercises at the end of each chapter, which are really helpful. The only bad thing is that is written in the form of a dictionary. Other than that is a great book to learn rudimentary medical terms."
3,pray befor you order!!!,"the book is ok it was the condition the book was in the add said, it was in very good condition and it wasn't the book was over $20 and it had writing all in the book the outer pages were torn...... this was the 2nd time i had orderd the book, the first time i orderd the book it never came i waited almost 2 months.... thank God my teacher showed me mercy the first week of school!!!"
4,A good handbook worth to buy,"This is a well-structured and very useful handbook for practical engineers at all levels. It provides quick references to the important information and commonly accepted methods in the geotechnical engineering.However,the handbook has no or little information in the following areas: soil dynamics, seismic hazard analysis, numerical modelling, geoenvironmental engineering."
5,Tammy's Best,This is the best compilation that I have found. It has all of her best songs and they sound great! I am so glad to finally have this cd. She truly was the best! Anyone who likes Tammy will certainly enjoy having this selection in their collection.
4,4 Stars from Scribesworld for Women's Fiction,The author keeps the reader entertained and engrossed with the lives of these women. The writing is concise with just the right amount of description. This was an enjoyable read and the book highly recommended for fans of women's fiction. -Reviewed by Shannon Bigham
4,"Monti ""Sweeps"" the publishing industry with first novel!","I thoroughly enjoyed Dean Monti's first novel. His writing is superb, the story of Malcolm is extremely funny and quite believable, which makes this an easy read ... once you start you can't put it down. Monti uses nice transitions from chapter to chapter, so there is a good flow to the story. Almost everyone can identify with at least some of Malcolm's neuroses. I'm anxiously awaiting another Dean Monti story!"
4,Great read.. want more!,"I laughed... some of it the kind of nervous laughter like that part in swingers where Mikey kept calling his ex-girlfriend and leaving messages. You just want to grab Malcomb and tell him to stop. I can totally picture the theater, 2-flat apartment and characters in this story. Really enjoyable. Thanks!"
2,"Lasted less than 1 hour, and my Cocker Spaniel is no big dog","My dog absolutely loved it but he destroyed it in less than 1 hour. The material is not strong enough, and my dog is not a destroyer (or so I thought), he is very gentle most of the time. There is something about the smell of the material that made him want to chew it all the time. He first bit the toy's ears, then the tail, and to finish he removed most of the filling. He also removed the squeaky thing inside the toy which I thought could be somewhat dangerous if swallowed. I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Ripped off by shipping!,"I can't believe shipping was so expensive! I tried to cancel the instant I got the confirmation, but it was too late. :( I would have saved $4. buying it at my local retail store. As for the product itself, my dog loves it.Subtotal of Items: $1.89Shipping & Handling: $6.15------Total: $8.04"
2,2 seconds,"This toy lasted two seconds with my older German Sheperd who is not a big chewer. We were looking for a softer toy to encourage her to chew but she just descimated this. Then, we got another one for our Great Dane puppy and the same thing happened. No good. Get for ancient dogs or don't bother."
1,NOT GOOD,does not tell you how many you get it shows you all of them but you do not get all of them you only get 1
4,Mini loofa dog toy,I (and my dog) love the toy but the ad is misleading. It gives the impression of getting several toys and this is NOT the case. You only receive one. I would suggest rewording the ad. Thank you
4,got for free,"only one, I got the blue one, got it for free on amazon add onsSo cute! My chihuahua puppy loves it she is teething and it keeps her entertained! I would buy this again especially since it is less money than petsmart!"
1,Misleading Picture,I purchased this product thinking I was ordering a package of dog toys instead I got one toy for 3 dogs. The picture is very misleading and bad advertising. I could have purchased the same cheap toy at Wal-Mart for that price! What a rip off.
4,my Shih Tzu loves this toy,"I believe this is the ""bobo"" toy from the petco commercials with the dachshund weiner-dog. Regardless, my dog loves it. it squeaks and throws easily. Though I'm not sure what they mean about a back scratcher. It's not that rough. It's too small for most larger breeds though."
1,Misleading Ad,"When I initially ordered this item, I was lead to believe that I was paying $4.43 for the 5 mini-loofa dogs. I find it is very misleading to put the 5 little toys in the product picture, have the ""product features"" say assorted colors, and the description say it ships in assorted colors. Please specify that the consumer is only getting one random colored toy! I would not have ordered this disappointing single pink toy for my two male dogs had I known that that's what I would be getting for almost $5! :("
1,Misleading Rip Off,Description is misleading-leads shopper to believe that they are getting 5 toys. I could have gone to the hardware store in town and got a bigger one for $1. I am thinking about returning on principle.
2,Do You Want to Be My Friend,"I ordered a hardcover copy of this title as a baby gift to go with an Eric Carle stuffed elephant. I love the story, but was very disappointed in the size of the book. It was approximately 3""x5"". I didn't think I had to ask about the size of a hardcover book. I just assumed it would be much larger. Couldn't get in touch with anyone at Amazon to see if there were larger sized books available. If I had known it would be so small, I would have at least purchased a board book which is easier for a baby to handle."
2,PAY ATTENTION TO THE DESCRIPTION,Pay attention to the description of this item. I quickly bought this for my classroom without reading the dimensions of the book. It is TINY and completely useless for what I was going to use it for.
2,To small of a book to share with a class,"I was planning on sharing this book with a class of students, but the size of the book is so small I do not believe I will be able to share it with a class. I was disappointed when I opened the package and saw the small size. I had only seen the bigger of the size of this book and that was what I was expecting."
2,Will you be my friend?,"Loved the book,was dissappointed in size.I got it to read to my classroom.Book showed up the size of a postcard, was not able to use. Wish that would have been specified on description."
2,Not Exactly What I Thought It Was..,"I was throughly disappointed when I received a rather small package instead of a bit larger package that I expected to receive. When I ordered this book, I had thought it was going to be the large, hardback copy of the book that I had imagined it would be. Instead, I received a tiny, hardback copy that was about 3 inches tall and 4 inches in width. Needless to say I was not very pleased. I planned on giving several of the Eric Carle books to my nephew for Christmas and now I am going to have to go out and purchase the actual normal sized books!"
4,tiny but powerful,this book is SMALLER than i was expecting but my son adores the little mouse asking to be everybody's friend...very cute...(hopefully teaching him about rejection - either that or it's just bumming him out)
2,"Tiny Tim's book (i.e., very small)",This book is small - it's pocket sized. I was surprised to see this because the other books I've bought from this series are larger - they are at least six-eight inches in one direction.
1,Is it just me....?,"or was anyone else confused by this book? Now don't get me wrong I don't expect War and Peace in a children's book, but a little more dialogue would have been nice. As it is, there are 2 possible conclusions I can draw from this book:1. The mouse is asking each animal to be his friend and they are all saying 'No', which makes them all very mean and not worth talking about or,2. The mouse is only asking the other mouse at the end of the book, ignoring all the other animals completely.Either way, here is the message I walk away with: Mice should only be friends with other mice (people should only be friends with their own kind). Is this what we want to teach our children?"
2,There are better editions of this title,"We decided to purchase this book for our toddler after she enjoyed the copy we had checked out of our local library. She had loved turning the pages and looking at the large pictures of each animal. Sadly, this copy was smaller than a postcard. When we read the copy from the library, I liked the idea of a book that tells a story with very little text, encouraging the reader to create his or her own. The way each animal's tail appears on the page teaches little readers to turn the pages in a book to reveal the narrative. I was disappointed that this edition has dialogue in which each animal rejects the mouse. I would have prefered the larger, textless edition. When ordering, pay attention to the dimensions!"
1,compared to hungry caterpillar a disappointment,"yes this is a book about friendship and i realize for child at times simple is better but this book i thought really lacked especially compared to how great a book the hungry caterpillar is(i personally think just about this authors best book)it has at the very start of the book the question ask by a mouse ""do you want to be my friend?""and then at the end a yes from another mouse no other writing between yes you can teach your child a little about the other animals the mouse is apparently asking though not in print.I personally thought this could have been laid out a little different"
4,a classic story,The story and pictures are in the classic style of the author. The book it's self is a lot smaller than I had invisioned.
1,TINY BOOK,"Bad, Bad, Bad! I get this book and it's TINY. It's the size of a 3x5 card. My mistake for not realizing I had to look at the size dimensions for every book I buy. I thought it would say something in the headline, but all it said was ""Do you want to be my friend"" (Hardcover). So upset! I teach children with visual and mental disabilities and I can hardly see the book myself. Darn!"
2,Too small for the price,"This book is smaller than a postcard, it is very hard for any early reader to decode the words with such a small print and not even talk about reading it to a group of children (that is what i wanted to do). I'm returning it."
4,Totally exhausts AIDS as a social issue,This work has fully lifted the veil on AIDS. It has focused on the various dimensions in which mankind has had to cope with a disease whose method of transmission transcends cultural barriers. The addition of a Resource Directory highlights the need for networking in today's global environment.
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"After reading the reviews I expected an entertaining and funny book. What a disappointment! I have never disliked a main character as much as I disliked Connie. The pretentiousness and self-absorbtion she displays was quite appalling. After a few chapters of hearing how good looking, funny and intelligent she thought she, as well as her friends, were I couldn't endure anymore. (And the reader is suppposed to believe she has a low self-esteem???) I honestly couldn't finish reading the book."
2,Not Worth It,"I got this book on the words of the other reviews here, plus it looked like a fun read . I am an avid reader of the 30 something Brit stories. I have to say this one is a bomb. I only read the prolouge and chapter one and I'm done, thanks! I can tell I already am not fond of this author's writing style. She doesn't seem to have it together enough to hold my attention and I can already see that in the first chapter. Plus, the main character seems way too high on herself.Not Impressed! I can tell this was a first novel...the novice writing style shows."
3,Disappointed,"I have tweezerman tweezers and they are fantastic. Expected the same from these, but they are mediocre. Not as crisp or sharp as I hoped. It takes too much pressure to cut. I will keep looking for a better one."
5,Bride: Show No Mercy,Track Listing: (Audio Cassette)Side 11. Evil That Men Do2. Now He Is Gone3. Fly Away4. Forever In Darkness5. Follow Your HeartSide 21. Show No Mercy2. I Will Be With You3. Thunder in The City4. No Matter The Price5. The First Will Be Last
4,Seems to work well,Seems to not leak on the art inside the cup which I have had problem with cups like this before. Keeps coffee very warm.
1,In a word - LEAKS!!!,"This cup is not of the quality you'd expect. I've had similar cups from Starbucks that I loved, but this one leaked, leaked, leaked, leaked!I never used it in a dishwasher, and still, the artwork inside was never safe for more than a couple of washings. The last time it got wet, I didn't remove it right away. The paper eventually must have swelled, dried, and warped. I could not remove it and wound up throwing the whole cup out.The paper used was brochure paper (glossy, but not as thick as photo paper). Each time I tried to get it out (by hand, skewer, or tweezers), the part that had been wet was now too weak, and it just ripped off in little bits."
1,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!,"We bought this item because advertisement says it's dishwasher safe. However, according to instructions that come with the mug when it was delivered, it is for hand washing only. THE ADVERTISEMENT IS MISLEADING! If you're looking for a dishwasher safe mug, DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT."
3,Blank Canvas Travel Mug,"I really love how my mug turned out, but that being said, I wish there would have been more ""space"" to slide the insert in after I got it made...one of my die cuts was a little on the thick side and a I had a terrible time trying to get it in place. All in all, I'm happy with this product and how it turned out in the end, it just took a while getting there."
2,"Nice, but fragile","I purchased four of these. I had carried one for a couple of years until I left liquid in it that froze and broke the mug. It is easy to insert pictures and they remain dry fairly well as long as you check the tightness of the seal occasionally. However, when I recieved the mugs 3 of 4 were broken. They appear more fargile than the one I had before. Though I have not found a better photo mug yet."
5,Great mug!,"I can't believe I found this mug here! I bought one at Wallie world years ago (more money) and have been using it every day! Very sturdy--except when you leave it on top of the car--fell off--outside cracked but still continued to use it! I really like the handle aspect--main feature for me and it fits in my old-car-small cup holder. I am replacing it now (buying two) only because it was in another accident--beyond it's control (don't go there). I love the picture placement thing! Love to show off my photos and this is perfect--just have to only use single layer sheet or it won't fit (no scrap booking in there) and do not put in dishwasher. All in all, a great mug. (I use a straw with it, but it was good with not spilling when the top is closed). Yay! Thanks Amazon!"
1,"Good cup, but the lid needs some work...","The lid of this cup is in the sliding tab style, which I never like, because old coffee and coffee mixed with creamers collects under there creating what my aunt has dubbed 'coffee cheese.' Also, the turn tab in the middle tends to bump your nose a little if you do anything more than sip.After less than a week of use, the handle on the mug caused it to slip out of a cup pocket on a bag, fall to the ground and crack! Cracked so bad that even coffee would leak into the space with the pictures inside. I'm very disappointed, as their tumbler's without the handle tend to hold up to years of wear and tear before needing to be retired."
2,tough to do,the cup is a great idea but it is really tough to actually slide the pictures or paper into the tiny slot with out making it wrinkle. it is really only good for standard paper width so picture paper doesn't really work. I was very frusterated and ended up making a mess of the project.
1,Don't waste your money,"It was very cool to be able to personalize the mug. However, the mug is just ashoddy product. I actually bought two. The first one fell off the top ofmy refrigerator and the bottom of the clear part shattered. ""Oh well,"" Ithought, ""probably just a freak accident, and I should be more careful."" SoI went back to Wal-mart and bought another one. Keep in mind that these are notparticularly cheap. I hadn't had this one a whole week when it fell off the workbench, a mere thirty inches off the ground, and it shattered in exactly the same way. That's not the worstpart. When I complained to Aladdin, they told me, in effect, ""Tough"".Bottom line-- a plastic mug should be able to take a thirty inch drop. If Iwanted a mug that would shatter, I would buy porcelain. Add to that thelack of concern by a formerly reputable company, and I just have to givethis product a big two thumbs down."
1,NOT dishwasher-safe,"In contrast to the listing, this product includes documentation stating it is not dishwasher-safe. I am returning the ones I purchased as presents."
1,31 minutes poor production,"There is a minimun of production on this 31 minutes tape. It does not reveal anything interesting to the topic. This was so far the worst documentary I have ever seen. It was boring to watch this, and it does not prove anything. It only shows again some poor footage that the goverment provided. Quite expensive for such poor production"
5,Easy Replacement,Several years ago the dealer for GE replacement parts doubled the price of this filter replacement set. I couldn't find this model in any hardware stores in the area. I've been ordering this through Amazon ever since. The various suppliers are efficient in delivering this product to me.
4,Ethernet cord,Ethernet wire was very good i am very pleased that i have a home network but just be care not to punch holes into the wire with a staple gun or anything or it will not be able to be used
3,panasonic handset speaker,I purchased this item for the handset speaker feature. It works just OK. The speaker volume on the handset is too low and a little distorted. I've heard cellphone handsetspeakers much louder and clearer. But overall its still satisfactory.
1,Don't Have a Clue,Do not have a clue to the properties of this item as it has been about 45 days and I still have not received the item. :(
5,"Psych-Out Garage,Hillbilly,Country,Thrash music from the 50s","Great album. There were 3 of the series released that I know of. I have the first 2 on vinyl. I would like to find the 3rd one. This album is comprised of music from people making those records in the booth to some people just cutting one or two songs at the local studio. The music ranges from true country to some sadistic-romping rock n roll. This is for fans of roots rock,garage and esoteric music. have fun, EVL."
1,STALE,Very disappointed to receive a case of food product with a freshness expiration date of only two months after purchase. It is unrealistic to expect that a case of Jiffy Pop would be used by a single consumer in two months. I felt cheated. I did not return the product as it seemed an excercise in futility.
3,"Good, but too many packs, and they could have been fresher",How about selling a six-pack or 12-pack instead of a 24-pack? Mine had an expiration date about four months in the future; that wouldn't have been so bad (though it's still unreasonable for a high-volume merchant like Amazon) if I had been able to purchase a smaller quantity.
4,"Good, Not Great","I bought this organizer to corral my kids c.d.'s in the car. However, this one wasn't big enough to stretch over the visor in my SUV. I am just throwing it in the driver's side door compartment instead. Not quite as convenient to use, but it works fine."
4,A sizing problem,The coat was very nice for the price but the sizing was really off. I ordered a Large and it did not fit me. I gave it to my daughter and it fit her great except for the sleeves being a little long. She wears between a small and a medium size.
4,Not as warm as Navy Peacoat,This coat is cut roomy enough for the mature figure but the shoulders were too large. Removing the shoulder pads and resewing the seams helped. I was disappointed that it was not as warm as the old Navy peacoats but I can wear it during autumn and moderate winter weather.
5,Great Pea-Coat,"I wanted a short carcoat that would be light enough to travel in hot buses, hot cars,and hot trains. I travel in all of these for my job. I chose this because of the double breasted front and back belt. The belt in the back gives the coat a touch of class and style that a plain back just would not do. Also the cut was done in such a way that makes me look slimmer and just the right amount of curves. You can't say that about alot of coats. Also, It looks good with sweaters underneath."
4,Kristen Blake Wool Blend Peacoat,The color is perfect and the overall look is very nice. It is not good for cold days.
3,110V for your car,"Xantrex is the number one inverter maker in the Americas. It's cheaper than buying all kinds of adaptors to power devices in your car. You can charge your laptop or phone while you drive, even re-charge batteries or power devices. (How to get more out of a gallon of gas.) The power cord on these (they make the duracell branded versions too) is proprietary. They have them in their online store but guess what. It's cheaper to buy a close out unit and throw away the charger to get a new adaptor cable for a more expensive unit."
3,Nice inverter,"Nice little inverter. The only bad thing about it was that when it arrived, it plastic packaging was scuffed and covered in dirt. Where are they storing these, in someone's garage??"
4,Works as advertised,"This works great on those transatlantic flights. I used it on AA and it powered my laptop and charged my iPod. Gets a little warm after a few hours of use, though."
2,Not good filters because they fall apart,"I bought this filter for my six gallon tank, they seemed to be falling apart already so I put it into another bag, went ahead and bought another filter, because of these bags, the last one I used, not from this seller, also fell apart and some of the inside particles got into my tank,what a mess! I didn't return them b/c they are so cheap."
4,62x90 Tavern Check Tablecloth,"This is a high quality tablecloth that lays flat without ironing even after a wash. The only drawback was the major shrinkage (approximately 10 inches off the long length) after a gentle wash in cold cycle and a gentle dry. I would definitely recommend ordering the larger size! Otherwise, a beautifully crafted tablecloth for the most discerning eye!"
2,Not A Reputable Company,"I own several homespun tablecloths so with the holidays coming I ordered a red one from this company.After washing one time in cold water and slow drying, it shrank about 15% and no longer fits the table. When I wrote them to complain they told me that 5-6% shrinkage was normal and that apparently 15% is within that range!Buy from a reputable company like homespuntablecloths.com that has true sizing tables and is willing to stand behind their product."
2,Not Worth the High Price! BEWARE!,"Crazy expensive and we knew up front, thanks to other reviewers, that hot water would shrink it drastically. Unfortunately, a gentle wash on cold does the same too. 90"" long and it ""barely"" covers the table length (with NO overhang at all). Shame on the company who must know this happens, but can't preshrink before selling. Too bad to as it is a beautiful tablecloth otherwise."
4,Classic Falco-- Falco and Petronious Longus Clean-up,"Falco returns to Rome from a road trip (""Last Act in Palmyra"") to help his pal Petronious Longus clean-up a crimewave started by an underworld power vacuum.This novel is a classic Falco, with Davis's witty dialogue, winding plot, established cast of characters, and Roman setting. This is Falco at his best.The story does suffer a minor problem with an all-to-quick wrap-up.Finally, I think Davis's long-term plot lines are getting ""long of tooth"". Its long past time for Falco to be elevated to equestrian rank, marry Helena Justina, take-over his father's business, and get into politics. Falco is getting too domestic to play the gumshoe.A joy to read for those who love Falco."
2,Slow and uninvolving,"I picked this up for some light reading after the recent tragedies, having read several of the author's previous books. This one is not up to par. The plot is uninvolving and a chore to get through. There is little wit and fewer surprises, and Falco seems uncharactistically heavy-hearted. Even the ""Roman"" details have gone missing; essentially, this mundane tale could have taken place anywhere. Looks like this series has run out of steam."
4,used to buy cartridge world,I go to cartridge world for my personal plain jane hp printer but grandma's mfc didn't seem to work well with the refurb cartidges. Hp cartridges are more expensive but they are name brand. alot of the cartridge world ones don't have the same amount of ink in them or the ink coagulates or something. buying a new hp cartridge every time is the cold calculated safe way out - this is what i get for grandma when i just want it to work untill i need to change it.
4,"Good Quality, Fast Service","I ordered this through Amazon 'MarketPlace' it came with free shipping. I didn't expect to see it arrive three days later, arriving on a Saturday and I didn't ask for expedited shipping. I've been using alot of black and decided on a 'double pack.'. Same quality you would find buying it in a retail store, at much cheaper price."
1,yield (pages) is omitted in the specs on purpose,the yield (190 pages max) is omitted from the specs. better to get HP 54 which yields three times more (600 pages) yet cost only 30% more. one can think that they omitt the yield in specs on purpose so you buy more of this one... unfortunately here like most other cases the consumer must be educated and well informed to save money. and that is what they (HP and the like)don't want....
3,For even better value...,"Buy the HP 21XL high capacity cartridge to get more ink for your $$. You won't be bothered with changing cartridges as often, either. The color cartridge is also available in higher capacity as the 22XL."
5,HP ink,Always a very steady product. Never had any problems with it. This order especially. I will order over and over until my printer dies
4,Excellent product,This two-in-one printer ink option is great for my HP printer. I usually use way more of the #21 (black) ink than the #22 (color) ink.
5,HP 21 Black Retail Twinpack,"A good value for this high quality HP product. What more can I say, ...always reliable, great results and fast printing.HP 21 Black Retail Twinpack"
2,Did not function acceptably.,"The price was right, the packaging and look was professional, but the performance was lacking. After using each of the 2 cartridges they would seem to dry out overnight. The 2nd day after installing the print would be light and have light streaks through word lines. Did not improve much after following instructions to clean heads with q-tip and alcohol. Company was very prompt in sending a postage paid return mailing label and offering to refund. Mailed both cartridges back the other day. Yesterday installed locally refilled cartridge and prints dark and crisp even after sitting overnight so the problem is not with my printer."
1,"Bad Service, Bad Service","I never received the item, was arbitrarily given an incorrect refund, even though I requested the item by email. Any attempts to contact the seller have been ignored. I will not buy another item from Amazon, because of this shoddy, unprofessional treatment. I will share this experience anytime Amazon comes up in discussion.Robert Toole"
5,Nice Ink,"These inks are great and long lasting. I have been using these on HP3915 printer. I don't use the printer much, and replace them once every year. No smudges/marks and well designed. I have been using HP printers and inks since 1999. Definitely recommend!"
1,Product Failure,"This product malfunctioned. The problem appears to be with the electronic contacts in the cartridge, obviously a manufacturer's defect. Returned it for credit."
5,Just what I need,"I love ordering ink from Amazon because I hate going to Walmart! This is about the same price as in stores and with Prime, it comes super fast. I works great in our printer. We print maybe 3-4 times a week and it usually last us anywhere from 4-6 months. Good quality. Can't beat it. Our printer is a Hp Desktop F4135."
3,Vendor Good Product mediocre,"Product was received on time and was as advertised.The HP21 Blk ink cartridge does not have enough capacity.No high capacity substitute is available.HP, if you are listening, we need a Hi Cap cartridge in this size."
3,Original HP 21 Black Ink,I sent these to my daughter at college. No complaints. I would hear if there were.
3,It will give a print out,"I believe this is a refilled cartridge. It is connected electronically to to printer. It did print just fine. But if you like to see ink levels as I do..it won't show - not on my printer. But again, it will print."
5,Quick Priced Reasonably,Arrived early which was good as last cartridge had just run dry. Price was best available. Packaging was minimal in keeping with green policy.
3,It works.,"Gets the job done. It is just printer ink so I don't really know what to say about this product, other than ""it works"" It is price-y considering the number of pages I get for a single cartridge. Do I recommend it? Get a newer ink-saving printer with newer printer cartridges instead, this is outdated technology already."
5,HP 21 Black Ink Cartridge,The ink cartridges are performing perfectly. They are a good product at a bargain price. And they arrived more quickly than I expected.
1,Disappointing.,"Like the other posters, I too was given this book as part of our homestudy for adopting a child from China. After reading the first chapter I found myself insulted. This book assumes all who read it are adopting because they cannot get pregnant, which is not my case. While infertility is something that should not be ignored, and I appreciate the fact that most adoption books I read address the matter, this book would have been much more respectable if it did not direct its text to the reader as a person who cannot conceive. I was so insulted that I returned the book to my social worker with these concerns."
3,Exhaustive and exhausting. As exciting as a textbook.,"This book has it all, including too much information on adopting the older child. There are books out there that deal specifically with this issue. This is an excellent guide for parents who are seeking international, transracial, special needs, or older child adoptions, but has little information for those adopting same-race infants ""fresh from the oven,"" so to speak. A little too much information and a little too clinical. Reads like a textbook."
2,"Useful info, holier-than-thou tone","Despite the fact that Melina makes the comment, ""in many respects being an adoptive parent is no different from being a biological parent,"" it seemed to me from the tone of the book that she doesn't believe that statement at all. While she criticizes biological parents for ""minimizing"" the differences between raising bio children and adopted ones, she does a 180 and interprets almost every single child-raising issue (many of which seem quite universal) as uniquely adoptive child-related (which is just as bad).While there's a lot of useful information in this book, especially the ideas about creating meaningful scrapbooks/lifebooks for children, I found the ""it's an adoption thing"" tone very grating after a while.If parents of adopted children ""adopt"" her tone, they're very likely to alienate everyone around them."
3,So-so,"This book has many valuable points, but also has many I do not agree with.I will use my own critical thinking process to discern which aspects I want to hold onto, and which ones I want to throw in the trash.I recommend ALL readers be critical thinkers and apply what they find best to their personal situations."
2,"Christmas Martinis,...","Only one good is Santa Baby, Twistmas is like a Shakin' Stevens song. Really nothing special. I bought this cd in 2001 and I've listened it maybe five times. Production is bad and keyboards are obnoctious!"
4,Shweet knife,"This knife isn't very pretty. Either closed or open the knife just doesn't look ""cool."" However, this knife is very practical. It's size and Gerber quality make it a wonderful all purpose knife. It is impossible to fling the blade out, but, with practice, you can get used to gripping it correctly to open the knife with just your thumb. This is a knife you will have to take time to get used to using for some of the more general purposes of any pocket knife, but for a job that requires a lot of effort and control for an extended period of time this is the most comfortable knife I have ever used. If you take the time to get used to it, you can do some cool spinning tricks with it too. Of all the knives I have ever owned, this knife was my favorite."
1,Do not buy without seeing it in person,"I personally find the finger hole to be very uncomfortable. The inside is a thick tube shape, so it isn't shaped for a finger very well. Maybe it will work for you, but it sure didn't for me.The bolt lock is a neat idea, but the opening and closing is kind of rough. It just feels like a low quality knife.You should definitely see if your local ""discount retailer"" that starts with a ""W"" and ends in ""al-mart"" has one in stock so you can try it out before buying."
5,Solved my problem,I wish I would have replaced them sooner. They were quite easy for my husband to install (with the right socket tool) and now when I pop my trunk from inside it unlatches and I can lift it easily. If you own this car you know the lid is quite heavy. Simple easy low cost for what use to be a very annoying problem for me. They work as well as the originals did when my car was new.
5,Strong enough for stock spoiler,I installed these(buy two) on a 2000 eclipse and they fit and work perfect. You might be able to find them for cheaper at Autozone but I wasn't able to. As from my title the struts are strong enough to raise the hatch with a spoiler. It's nice when you can pop the hatch from the release inside or use the key and the hatch will actually disengage enough. If you have had problems with your hatch only working in the heat or have had the hatch fall on your head i highly recommend getting these.
4,Works Great with 2000 GT,After buying the struts I ran into a problem installing them as the Eclipse has bolts welded inside the frame. When the first strut was removed the bolt broke loose making it impossible to install the new strut. I got lucky and found a body shop where they had the tools to install a new bolt without having to cut the frame. The best part was the repair was only $60.00 and took about 10 minutes. The new struts make it possible to use the hatch again.
1,Item description incorrect!!,Item listed DID NOT fit auto listed. Purchased part and it did not fit. FULL REFUND including return shipping is expected. Anything less is unacceptable!!! The buyer should not be responsible for ANY return costs when products are mislabled.Listing needs to be changed to keep from misleading future customers!!!
4,Works well,"These work well and get the job done. A little wobbly when full but nothing you can't handle. Good value, I highly recommend these to someone like myself - not much room in the house, getting started with wheat grass, keeping costs low."
3,OK but flimsy,"For the price, these trays are OK, but by no means a 5 star product. You get what you pay for; not much. If you fill a tray with soil and then water or soak the soil and then lift the tray by the ends, the sides will bow and be at real risk of buckling. You will have to be very carful how you handled filled trays. I reinforced the edges my new trays with trellis sticks.By the way: the delivery process was excellent; easy and prompt."
1,Picture is misleading,Part arrived on time and fit and worked well. The picture however is misleading. No boot or bellows was shipped with the part as the picture would seem to indicate.I've provided feedback to Amazon.com regarding the incorrect picture and received a reply that they reviewed my comments and did not feel any action was necessary.I would have bought the same product for a lower price from another on-line source had I known no bellows would be included. Hence the single star....Would recommend not buying on Amazon unless the offering has explicit text regarding what the packaging contains.
2,Does'nt ever take-off...,I was hoping the book would get where it was trying to go - but it never did. Marginally funny. An excellent first effort and I wish the author success in the future. But I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone.
5,ge fx12m membrane,"very nice, the product is match with my original type. and the product is new with no damaged. it function well with no problem so far, and the price is reasonable. shipping is also in time. it is good overall."
5,"great buy ,high quality! crossbow case","very good buy,outstanding quality, a convenient and easy storage bag for your crossbow and accessories."
5,Fantastic case,I love the Kodiak crossbow case! It fits my crossbow perfectly. The fabric is of high quality.
1,Panasonic Big Button Phone Review,"I purchased this phone for my father-in-law approx. 3 weeks ago. It is NO LONGER WORKING as of 1 week ago. His last Panasonic big button cordless phone lasted approx. 10 years. Why is it so difficult to find a phone with bigger buttons, without all the extra unneeded buttons, and long lasting quality. My 85 year old father-in-law would be hard pressed to find a good quality phone to suit his needs. I went to 5 stores locally and then went online to countless sites to find this and then it did not last."
3,It's a average phone,It's average phoen with average performace.I couldn't use it in the next room hardly 20 ft away.The receipient was not able to hear few of the words inbetween.I myself tested by calling from my cell and yes it is eating-up some of the words.
3,Hello...Good Phone for the Price,"Good quality phone; no caller ID feature; easy to use; good range from base; voice enhancer makes calls clearer; for the price, this is an excellent telephone; large buttons with lighted keypad make dialing easy."
5,nice sunglasses,I bought these for a xmas present for my husband and he loves them. They are comfortable and light but not cheaply made.
5,Christmas in Camelot,"This book was wonderful! I loved the way the author alter view every couple of paragrahs! While it may have been a tad confusing at first, in the end it helped me to gain a better understanding for the characters."
2,A Snooze for the Season,"The only feeling of Christmas you get from this book is that they are decorating the house for the season. That's it - not really mood-setting for the season.Besides that, the story was slow and the writing stilted and the characters boring. The author tried to make it magical by adding characters like Merlin and King Arthur, but it just doesn't seem to work, there was very little authenticity. I wouldn't reccommend this one at all, there have to be better stories out there to celebrate the season!"
5,"Big Bag = Great night sleep if you are a ""mover.""","I move around way too much in my sleep to be able to sleep well in a mummy bag or even a regular sleeping bag. These bags are giant (my wife has one too)!!! At first when they arrived, I thought the outside shell material felt cheap to the touch but after using them for the first time, that image vanished as they are comfy, zip easy, and look great.NOW - remember - this is a +5 degree bag, but... The size makes it hard to heat up. If you can do a regular or mummy bag and really need a low degree bag, maybe something else would be better. We slept in low 40 degree weather and I was fine (though my wife was cold). If you zip them together it is about the same size as a queen bed. Also - I recommend if you get this oversized bag to make sure you also get an oversized sleeping matt."
5,"Great price, warm and cozy, nice color too!","We bought four of these Wenzel Oversized sleeping bags to replace our old generic sleeping bags, and took our family camping with them in late October. Although the night got down to 30 F, we slept cozy and warm. We love the woodsy colors of these bags, when so many other sleeping bags are bright colors and patterns that don't look outdoorsy. They have durable plastic buckles on the attached straps, to secure them when rolled up. Their large size is also great, since it traps warm air inside with you, and leaves enough room to move around comfortably. The only drawback to these bags is that the outer cover is fabric, and without a nylon stuff sack they will get damp or dirty quickly. But they are machine washable and dryable, so even this isn't a big negative.Overall we are very happy with our new bags, and look forward to many more years of sleeping in them. A great value for the money, and great looking too."
5,Large Enough,"Excellent product, the only one so far that is as big as stated.Being used as a covering for a memory foam mattress. Sleeping on topor outside of bag during the warm periods and inside with a flannel linerwhen it gets cold."
3,Tweezerman Ingrown Hair/Splinter Remover,Tweezerman Ingrown Hair/Splinter Remover: They changed the design from past product I have owned. Not as sharp & thin as what I had before. Not as well performing but will get the job done. Prefer old design though!
5,Sounding great!,"Used these to replace our Mazda Miata headrest speakers.Two per headrest, almost like a set of headphones, L & R channels.Sounds super. Old ones were totally shot. Amazing improvement."
3,The price is what you get,I bought these speakers about 1 week ago i got them in. They look pretty nice but they don't sound as good as they look don't get me wrong there not bad if your just fixing up your stereo but if your gonna be using an amp/sub then you are gonna wanna look for another set of speakers that cant actually handle thw power of the sound or bass but for $11 you cant expect to get the best 3.5/5
1,junk,"wow, these sound horrible. words cannot express my displeasure. i expected these would suck as they were cheap as hell but they really really suck. how could anyone post a good review?!?"
2,"OK speakers for the price, but only one speaker worked!","I bought these speakers to replace my stock speakers in my 1989 cavalier. I installed them both with ease, but when I turned on my music the left speaker worked and the other one was making weird sounds like something was virbrating inside the speaker. I check everything make sure I didnt do somthing wrong, but everything was good. The speaker that did work sounds alright, not amazing or anything. Over all I wouldnt recommend these. I would suggest paying for a more expensive brand. Its only like a 25 dollar difference. Well hope thats helps."
3,You get what you pay for.,"The Legacy LS328 3.5"" speakers are pretty good. For $15, they're worth picking up to replace your old blown or stock 3.5"" speakers."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"Had 2 blown dash speakers, bought these because they were cheap and had good reviews. There terrible. My 2 blown speakers sound better than these do. First day having them installed and I ordered Boston Acoustics already. Don't buy."
2,Not Flush!,"These speakers may be GREAT! But, I will never know, because the tweeter extends outside the grill! It is not recessed! It was not compatible with my installation."
3,not what I ordered,"I ordered 2 sets to put in my '92 miata's headrests, but when the package showed up it had two sets of ""Pyramid"" speakers in it, not the legacy ones listed. Not a big deal for me, cause they were the same size and specs as the legacy so i installed them anyways. I therefore don't know how the legacy speakers work, and keep in mind that you might get something else. The pyramids I got do an alright job, but I'm always wondering a little if these legacy's might have been a little better...."
3,OK Speakers,"These are OK but nothing great. I was dissappointed that they did not come with speaker grills for them. Not sure where I will find those now but it does make what you thought was a good deal, not quite so good."
4,Shock Lube great for airsoft guns!,"I used this product as gearbox oil inside my airsoft's gearbox. It works great! I use it on all the gears, piston, everywhere. Low price and good quality."
2,Too simplistic,"I love science shows. I love everything physics / astronomy / space. I hate this series. It seams lately that the Science Channel, The History Channel, and others try to make complex subjects simple by using moronic metaphors and annoying examples. It has been a while since I STOPPED watching this series so I can't cite examples, but they are many.I suppose this type of show makes science more understandable to someone who would never watch science shows to begin with, but then, whats the point. I hope the producers of these shows get a clue, because for people like me who actually like the subject matter, this is painful. We can handle straight science without insulting our intelligence."
3,"LISTED AS NEW, DEFINITELY NOT NEW","I haven't yet played the DVDs - they arrived only today. But the item was listed as 'new' - and they cannot be new because they are repackaged and the inside casing is terribly worn and not clean...the discs themselves have been cleaned and the cleaning fluid is streaked across the DVDs - I don't mind buying used items but state that they are used...state that they are 'like new' but when they have been played, when the INSIDE casing is worn down at the edges and along the sides, it's obvious these DVDs have been played...I will never purchase from this company again: ABC-DVD (the DVDs may play beautifully but that's not the problem -the problem is stating that something is new when it obviously is not!)"
2,Disks were scratched!,"Product came in a timely manner and was packaged nicely. However, more than one disk was damaged. I won't buy here again."
2,Picture/description DO NOT match item.,"I purchased 2 of these thinking they were female IEC to male IEC turnaround extensions as pictured. in fact they are not that at all. these are 3 prong 15amp NEMA FEMALE on one side, and IEC male on the other. only useful for turning a standard power cable into an extension cable. I had to use them regardless of their being wrong due to time constraints. was not pretty. Seller should change the picture to the same one that belkin lists on their website (search ""F3A101"" on belkin.com). Wish I had checked it beforehand."
2,Dora the Explorer Shoulder Bag,This item was a Christmas gift for a 3 yr. old - it was huge. My fault for not paying attention to the measurements given. I gave it to her anyway and she loved it. She'll use it as luggage when going to Grandma's.
5,My Daughter loves this!,"As with all of the products that I bought my 6 month old daughter for christmas, I read all of the reviews before purchasing. I noticed that many of the reviews indicated that this book was intended for 12 month old children due to safety. However, my daughter LOVES this book. I make buzzing noises as the bee goes through the book and she just giggles like crazy!"
4,More fun now he's older,"Our son didn't care much for this when he was under the age of two, but now that he's older and knows the animals and colours, he has a lot of fun with this book. He also enjoys ""reading"" it to his baby sister. He likes to poke the bee in the flower, and other places in the book. It's a well made book."
5,Love this book!,"This book is so cute. I got it for my granddaughter and she loves it. It's so bright and colorful and the little bee going through from page to page is very cute. It's made of such a soft material, so if my grandaughter puts it in her mouth she won't get cut or hurt. Thanks so much! This book is different and we love to read it!"
4,"Not the book in the picture, but a great book!","Oddly, the book I received was not the book in the picture, but I still gave it 4 stars because the book I did receive is really good! It's got lots of fuzzy clouds and a mirror and crinkly flaps that my 4 mo. old daughter loves to play with, and attached stuffed animals she can grab. I honestly didn't notice it was different until the request to review it popped up on my e-mail (I ordered 3 cloth books and received 3). I didn't report the mix-up to the seller because it turned out I was happy with the replacement."
2,Too Busy,I bought this book for my 7 month old daughter. It tries too hard. There is way too much going on and she gets overwhelmed when reading it. At 9 months she would still rather read the more simplistic Squishy Turtle book.
3,Like it but don't love it,"Our 2 1/2 year old granddaughter has so many great books that will be shared with her baby brother so it was a little difficult to find something nice that they don't already have. I chose this book because of the soft pages and the hide and seek aspect. Both the 5 month old and 2 1/2 year old enjoy it, but not sure it is worth the price. They have a similar soft book (Jellycat) with lots of tails to grab and more pages that make that crinkly-sound that babies like. If you are choosing between the two books, I would go with the Tails one."
2,Never Played With,"Bought this for my daughter at 6 months and she showed no interest in it. I purchased it for a plane ride where we could sit and discover the book together but she was unimpressed, even now it remains in her toy bin untouched. She enjoyed other cloth books but this one was a dud."
2,Why the World Needs Editors,"The author clearly has great knowledge of a fairly arcane subject on which there are few books. Unfortunately, he is an atrocious writer. The text is rife with bad punctuation, mangled syntax, subject-verb disagreements, and words utterly and egregiously misused. Reading it -- or trying to -- is a painful and punishing experience.I don't expect the author of a book of this type to write like Tom Wolfe. But his failure to enlist the aid of an editor who could bring the text up to minimal standards of literacy is a major act of contempt toward readers. Prose this bad should never, ever be committed to print."
5,The Ship's Chronometer--some reviews should be discarded,"This is an excellent reference and text on marine chronometers. While I have only browsed sections of the book, I have found it interesting and valuable. It covers topics ranging from history, to design, to maintenance, to repair, to background material for those interested in time and its importance in navigation. I highly recommend this book AND I highly recommend that the review by Charles Morse be relegated to the obscurity it so richly deserves."
1,Crap,"Don't waste your money. I unfortunately assumed that like most photo frames there was an insert in the back. This is a cheesy piece of ""metal"" sticky tacked to a piece of glass & it's too big for a 5x7 photo so the photo sits lower than the top of the frame. Bad design."
3,Interesting ideas but sometimes tedious,"I bought this book because somebody recommended the chapter about soul ties and it was good, but the rest kind of get tedious."
2,"Repetitive, formulaic...","I'm a guy who reads a lot. It's extremely rare that I haven't finished a book that I've started, no matter how bad it is. This is a book I put down half way through and, oddly enough, have shown no interest in picking it up again. I felt no attachment to the characters and no sense of intrigue about what was/is going to happen next.Basically, it appears as if the author read Michener and decided to copy the ideas and plot line without adding soul or the kind of depth that Michener could. Each chapter was the same story repeated: only the names were changed to protect the banality of the story.I do not recommend this book."
5,great for a trip to Brazil,"I bought a Kindle right before a vacation in Brazil specifically so I could read this 700+ page monster without the weight - and I'm glad I did. One of the Amazon reviewers criticizes Uys' characters, but the true characters here are the different historical eras we pass through. These become so real that we can easily imagine what it would have been like to be alive in each of them. This is a significant achievement considering the novel spans 500 years. I confess to skimming some (to me) overly detailed battle scenes, but aside from that the book held my interest from beginning to end, and I learned a lot along the way. In addition, two seven hour flights passed quickly."
3,History as Fiction,There are remarkably few books in print that give a comprehensive overview of Brazilian history so this was one chosen almost from necessity. The author does a great job of highlighting major events in the development of Brazil and brings it right up to date but unfortunately from my point of view the way in which the plot is put together as a focus on a few individuals means it was not the book I really wanted. In spite of not achieveing my objective it is a worthwhile book to read .
2,too long by half,i normally really enjoy reading books that cover history with fiction mitchener is a master of this and i have read most of his books but this one i got half way and couldnt work out a reason to keep reading as i had lost interest and went and ordered some better reads glad i was able to easily get another good read
1,"Trying to be Michener, falling short","Uys cites James Michener's magisterial historical novels as the inspiration for his work, and indeed, worked as Michener's research assistant during the production of 'The Covenant'. Michener himself wasn't an outstanding writer at best, technically speaking, but he was a master storyteller. The tales and situations that he crafted drew readers in- Uys, unfortunately cannot match the master's alchemy. Brazil is just rather turgid. It's not outstandingly bad but it's just rather boring."
1,A Music is missing!!!,"The original record had 5 music, If you charge 65USD at least put them all on the CD!!!!CD 1 (total time 39:55) :1. Fire and Rain (11:35) [James Taylor]solos: Hubert Laws, flute; George Benson, guitar2. Red Clay (14:31) [Freddie Hubbard]solos: Freddie Hubbard, trumpt; Stanley Turrentine, tenor saxophone; George Benson, guitar; Ron Carter, bass3. Sugar (15:51) [Stanley Turrentine]solos: Stanley Turrentine, tenor saxophone; Freddie Hubbard, trumpt; George Benson, guitar; Ron Carter, bassCD 2 (total time 36:36) :1. Blues West (20:40) [Eumir Deodato]solos: Stanley Turrentine, tenor saxophone; George Benson, guitar; Freddie Hubbard, trumpt; Hubert Laws, piccolo; Johnny Hammond, electric piano; Ron Carter, bass2. Leaving West (15:51) [Stanley Turrentine, Ron Carter]solos: Stanley Turrentine, tenor saxophone; George Benson, guitar; Billy Cobham, drums; Airto Moreira, percussion"
3,"Lotsa pep, skimps on the laughs","I so much wanted to like this. Small show, fun campy premise, possibility for social commentary on the 1950's ""Atomic Cafe"" nuclear naivite. To be honest, it fell short for me. The music is servicable, but nothing sticks with me after a couple listens (except perhaps the catchy opening number). Didn't make me laugh. Fun arrangements and an energetic cast help make up for the lukewarm material."
1,Save your money. Don't buy from this seller,"I ordered a CD. When it didn't arrive in the expected time frame, I contacted the seller. I got a canned message saying I should wait 30 days. I waited 30 days and still no CD. I contacted the seller again, and got the same canned message I had gotten before. I then asked for a refund. It has been 3 days, and I've gotten no response. Not good business.I wish I could comment on the CD, but since I never got it, I can't."
1,Listen For Yourself (but try not to pay for it),"To compare this show to FLOYD COLLINS and RENT is a breath-taking bit of hubris. FLOYD COLLINS was an original piece of theatre, and RENT was at least ... slightly unusual. This show just didn't have anything going for it; it was a little cute, a little tuneful, but mostly dull and familiar. The producers probably hoped that would insure success, since Broadway audience generally love the unchallenging and familiar. But if, even with Cameron Mackintosh's money behind them, the writers can't get their shows to succeed in America, there doesn't seem to be much hope of their becoming the hope of the musical theatre."
3,Tracklist,"Maxi EP single featuring some songs from her Metamorphosis album.1. So Yesterday (Remix) Exclusive track2. Party Up (Remix) Exclusive track3. Why Not (Remix)4. Sweet SixteenNot sure if the remix of So Yesterday is the Thunderpuss Mix or the Squeeze 18 Mix. Could also be the GoodAndEvil Remix. The remix of Why Not is probably the McMix which sounds a bit like a Metro remix and it's pretty decent. Haven't heard Party Up (Remix) or Sweet Sixteen but they're probably nice songs too.This remix EP would be perfect if it had the Chris Cox Flood Mix of Come Clean on it, that would probably make it a collectors item. But it's not bad, if you're a fan of Hilary, I'm sure you will enjoy this remix EP."
1,Bon Dance NOT!,"There are sixteen selections on one CD. The first selection sounds like a Japanese melody in the style of the '60s, a mixture of traditional intruments with an orchestra. The other fifteen selections are modern westernized Japanese pop-songs with the singer backed up by an orchestra and women backup singers. The title is misleading, if you expect Bon Dance music you will be very disappointed! This a collection of what sounds like lounge music with a few Latin numbers."
2,Over hyped,"To hear some people, it's the greatest movie ever... Poor quality, not very professional. Some good stuff on Lopez and the Hawaiian crew, but way too hippy influenced. I expected so much more."
2,"Not so new, not so good","I never saw the original film at the movies, but I have to think that Greg MacGillivray and Jim Freeman would not have filmed something that looks like it was made by sitting a camera in front of a TV set. The station identifier was even in the lower-right corner of the screen. For the price, this was a very disappointing purchase. The only reason for the second star was because of the content. Great movie, great soundtrack, but the quality was terrible."
2,No Beach Boys,"A wonderful film, however without the original Beach Boys sound track, the film lacks at least half of its beauty and value. Disappointing."
3,"Great picture, short lamp life","The other reviewers wrote great things about this set. I had it for 2 years and I agree. The picture is great to stunning when watching HDTV, good to very good with DVD (in cinema mode), and OK to good with analog NTSC signal.The real problem is that the bulb/lamp does not live the advertised 5000 hrs. mine blew at 1600 or so. Many people on the various forums fume about those unexpected $300 expenses every several months.Check this for details:http://www.petitiononline.com/panbulb/"
1,"Lamp life 10 months, $300 to replace","Prepare to spend $300/year on this product. They say lamp life is 5000 hrs, it's more like 1000-1500. It is guaranteed for only 12 months by panasonic."
2,Your basic cheap Taiwanese ratchet kit,"I bought this as an emergency kit to keep in my trunk...I had fairly low expectations, and this purchase met them ""Fullerly"" ;-).It should be fine if you need to assemble IKEA furniture and the like.Even at $9, I would say this is still a bit overpriced...it's more like a bargain-basement item...probably should sell for half the price. Two stars for the decent case ;-). No complaints...it is what I expected...just informing you, the potential buyer.NOTE: There is no ""quick release"" on the 3/8"" ratchet...in fact, I will be lucky if it does not quick-release itself and fall apart [it appears to be loosely held together by a plastic ring, as opposed to quality ones that are snug and all metal]. However, the 1/4"" spinner handle for the samller sockets may last longer.Also, while they do have a small compressable ball on the ratchet spindle, like the big boys, the sockets themselves do not have corresponding holes for it to slide into...kind of useless."
3,You get what you pay for.,This light weight set is great for around the house but not for serious automotive or mechanical use.
2,"not 3/8""","most of the sockets in this set are used with the 1/4"" adapter in the kit, not what i wanted at all, i only use the 3/8"" sockets, and was shocked to see that i had to use the supplied adapter when i wanted to use the smaller socket sizes."
3,Alli results,"Product does aid in excretion of fatty acids, but haven't really seen any substantial weight loss, but I realize that it's a marathon and not a sprint."
1,disapointed,Medication was not effective. What i suspect is that the capsules are either fraudulant altogether or much older than stated on bottle as the pills were not effective and i have substantial experience with the drug to know what to expect. Would like to hear from other purchasers who have experience with this drug and did not have the experience they expected. The drug Alli and xenical have been around for a long time and purchasable in Mexico as well as other countries and these drugs (for me ) have always been the real thing.
4,"alli weight-loss aid, Orlistat, 60 mg Capsules, 120 Count Refill Pack Review","I have used alli for about 3 months and I am kind of glad to be off of them right now because of the many bowel movements that it caused me to have, not to mention the treatment effects as well. My weight just yoyo-ed up and down, not getting anywhere."
3,OK,"I have used these in the past and had mixed feelings. These are not a miricle cure! The only thing these helped with was constipation! The thing is if you buy these and don't change your ways, then you will loose control of your bowels. Yes, I learned the hard way. However if you watch what you eat it shouldn't be an issue. So with all things considered, don't waste your money, just diet without getting the runs. I did loose 2 dress sizes, but it was down to the diet I was on, not these tablets."
3,No results yet on scale-using consistently for one month now,"I've been using Alli for one month now and haven't seen any results on the scale yet. I haven't had real bad side effects like in other reviews. But I do sometimes see the ""fat"" in the toilet (which took me by surprise the first time I saw it). It definitely teaches you to eat better (or you will be going to the bathroom very urgently and frequently afterwards..happened 2x to me after giving in to a temptation). I even took it Thanksgiving day and felt fine that night and the next day (but I was conscious on what I ate and didn't eat a lot of fattening foods). I rated this 3 stars just because I haven't seen results yet on the scale...but with seeing the ""fat"" in the toilet I'm hoping that it's doing something...it just may not be reflecting on the scale yet."
4,"great product, works if you are in a diet",this product is great and only work if you follow a diet and the information on the booklet on how to use it propertly
2,BUMMED; JUST DON'T GET IT!,"Kudos to ALL of the people that Alli has helped. You guys make me wonder if there is something wrong with me! :) Alli has done nothing for me----I have been on this for 2 weeks now and when I do go have a bowel movement I do see some orangy stool BUT that is it---key words here ""when I do go"" Alli doesn't seem to make me go and there have been times when I have had more fat than suggested What makes it so bad, is that I am probably taking twice as much as the people are on here that have left reviews. My doctor presribed me Xenical and when they told me how much it was, I asked for the generic. What did I receive? 2 BOXES OF ALLI with instructions to take 2 before each meal. I was hoping this would help me along but I am not as confident as I was before getting the meds filled. Any advice would be appreciated. :)"
4,Great Buy!,"Excellent price, took a little longer to get than I had hoped so I had to contact them. The product arrived 2 days later."
5,Fat absorbing.,Alli does just what is claimed as you follow the directions and I also found if you don't overload it on the your first few uses with an extremly high fat meals.
1,Not reccomended,"I took Alli for a a little less than 10 days, stayed under the recommended fat grams. I did experience slight side effects but nothing bad where I was constantly in the bathroom. I started experience stomach pains, I stopped taking and figured I just had a stomach bug. After a few days and the pain was just getting worse, I finally went to the ER and had to have my appendix removed. I don't know if it was from the Alli or just fluke, but I wont take the Alli again especially after I have done some research (which I should of done beforehand) and seen how many people are having diverticulitis and other issues."
4,My Wife Results,"I bought this product on behalf of my wife. No ladies, it's not what you think, I didn't tell her she was getting fat, she wanted me to research the best product on the market. Although Alli helped her to lose a few pounds, it wasn't without it's side effects. She didn't really start losing weight fast until, I put her on a stack using both Alli and PhenTabz Weight Loss Appetite Suppressant Diet Pills (30 Day Supply)"
2,ALLI is not for ALL,"The reviews on ALLI seemed favorable so I gave it a shot. It didn't work all that well for me. It made me feel less guilty about eating certain foods but it also worked to make me more aware of how many foods I should avoid. It's an aid, not a cure."
1,LOT: 13411 EXPERATION 11/14 NOT WORKING !!! SECOND BATCH OF ALLI NOT WORKING. SENDING MINE BACK.,LOT: 13411 EXPERATION 11/14 NOT WORKING !!! SECOND BATCH OF ALLI NOT WORKING. SENDING MINE BACK. BAD BATCH. CALLED GSK AND ARE SENDING A PRE-PAID ENVELOPE SO I CAN SEND THE PRODUCT BACK. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS FOR NOW.
3,good only for those who eat a diet high in fat,"This is a great product for those looking for a little extra help in the weight-loss department. It didn't work as well for me since my diet is much higher in carbs than fat, and this product is up-front explaining that it will not help in this scenario. So if you eat a diet high in fat, this product may be able to provide that little extra boost; if you eat a diet higher in carbs, this will not help you."
3,weight loss,I recommend this product for anyone who has tried to lose weight & lost. I have tried many diets & products & this one works. Just read the books that are included & you will lose weight.
4,Great Price-Works Great,"I have to be thrilled at the saving I received with this product. There was a $16.00 saving and no shipping cost either. WHOOT!And in the last month of using Alli to help with my diet and exercise program, I have lost 21 lbs. DOUBLE WHOOT!Since I am using Alli as recommended there has not been any adverse side effects either.So this was a win-win situation for me.Promise I will be back to purchase more and continue on to my weight loss goals."
5,Great Product,I use the Alli pills and I feel like they work. They help me maintain how much fat I consume. It is a good product.
5,Good Stuff,I like it because it gives the incentive that I lacked. I pay 40 dollars for one bottle and it gives me the incentive to watch what I eat. But it does allow you to splurge more often and still not gain back your weight.
2,What Happened?,"I have purchased this product before and lost about 10 lbs and did have most of the side effects but they were bearable as long as the product worked. I purchased this product again from a different seller (the price was alot cheaper) and started taking it. The caplets appear to only be half full and i'm not sure if they are supposed to be full or not. I am not having ANY of the side effects that I had before and haven't lost a single pound ( I mean, even when i eat really greasy, fatty foods, there is nothing whereas before there was) I'm just not sure if the product is as its supposed to be. Be careful who you order your products from."
4,working for me so far,"just like everyone else says, it is not a miracle drug. for me it is a psychological thing - eat bad now, pay later. it helps you realize just how much fat is in the foods we eat, and the realization is what they so nicely call ""treatment effects."" it's a learning experience, and is producing nice results for me. i've been on it for about 3 weeks and have lost 5 pounds. a slow, consistent loss which is a result of adjusting your diet and exercise are key to keeping off the weight. i'll stick with it."
3,It wasn't like befor!!!,"I've used this product in the past, and now that I have to take pain-killers, this product doesn't work as well!!! I just wish there were ways to contact the Rx company and ask them questions. Moreover, there should be a place to ask such needed questions, while purchaseing on Amazon...live & learn... ;("
2,Alli is back on the market,"Alli is back on the market now so don't pay these outrageous prices you see on amazon. This stuff is great, I know it is working cuz I can see the fat deposits in the toilet. Gross huh? But at least the fat is not in my body."
2,ALLI,"I have bought alli through Amazon.com, it is not working as expected. I have used alli in the past and it worked for me, but this one is not working for me. I wish, I could return the purchase, but I didn't get the sellers contact or anything, this time I will just goto walmart and buy the bottle instead. I have a doubt about this purchase"
5,GREAT WAY TO LOSE A FEW POUNDS!!,"I started taking this item 30 days agao and Ive lost 11 lbs. Eat right, eat smaller portions-nothing fatty or greasy and you can too."
2,Rip-off,"Outrageously expensive !! Twice what can be paid in the stores. If not for the Re-call and unavailability, I would have never spent that kind of money."
2,The number thing i learned while taking Alli.....,"Never trust a fart. Took the pills for one month and lost zero weight. It simply did not work for me. But it gave me terrible gas, with oily discharge. I think i will try something else. Glad it works for others, but just not for me."
1,Does not work,The only way to lose weight is calories in and calories out! If you exercise it will speed it up! If there were a magic pill to lose weight it would be prescription and possibly expensive. In which case.... There would be no fat rich people!
1,Alli Weight Loss capsules,"This product is possablly a great weight loss capsules, if you can handlea lot, and I do mean lots of bow movements, you will go till your rear end is so sore you can not sent down.I guess it is because it is removing the fat content of a meal you just ate."
1,Problem with Alli capsules,It appears that many Alli capsules are actually empty of contents. I have cut open numerous capsules and found inconsistencies in the amount they contain with some actually completely empty.
1,Watch Your Pants,If you cheat on this diet and have some taco bell for lunch you pay for it by realizing you just shat in your pants. I would suggest a 'man pon' till you know how your body will react with this product. Dont forget that extra pair of undies..... you`ll need them!
3,Alli - one week review,"Trying it for past 10 days. I had already started exercise (Curves), and watching my diet, and was beginning to see progress - slowly.I think the ""treatment effects"" are exaggerated as ""worst case"" - ie if you are stlil going to eat pizza, french fries, and fast food you will see the ""effects"" of that menu passing through you. And, frankly if you are on that type of a diet (I was) you were likely having similar ""effects"" already (I was)!I don't know yet whether Alli will give a boost to my ongoing weight loss, but I have not experienced any of the horror effects discussed. Occasionally some orange oil in my stool - which lets me know I ate something with fat that didn't absorb - and that is, oddly, comforting."
3,Side Effects,"I took Alli from July 6th to Sept 5, and lost 15 pounds. Love it EXCEPT I have now developed one of the side effects of Orlistat (ingredient in Alli) which is Arthritis ;(I have to stop taking for a month to see if it clears up, if so then it's 1 month on one month off. If not, I'm done with Alli. Sad too cause this is a great product."
5,alli weight loss aid.,"I THINK ALLI IS GOOD FOR ME,I HAVE LOSS 12LB SO FARE SO GOOD AS LONG AS I LOSS THE WEIGHT I WELL CONTINUAL,I AM HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT.The alli Diet Plan"
5,"If you correct your expectations, than this product is excellent","I give Orlistat aka Alli an A++It is one of the best tools that help you along with your weight loss. Granted that you MUST change what you eat or you will experience tons of side effects. One of the best websites on the side effects is here:[...]I have lost 150 lbs and want to lose another 20-30lbs. Alli was one of the tools i used. I say it boosted my weight loss plan by about 5%. This is my own calculations of course.WARNING! do not depend on it as your single source for weight loss and if you order this be sure to order multivitamins along with it, because the reduced amount of triglyceride will reduce absorbtion of important vitamins."
2,embarassing...,"I bought this product when it first came out because it was claiming that it was fda approved and there is no side effects etc. However, I did not lose weight. Well, my stool did become oily and there was gas all the time. It gave me so much embarrassing moments. I do not recommend this at all..."
1,alli weight loss aid,"this product did not work. I didn't experience any of the side effects the drug warns about. It mentions you will have ""oily"" discharge and loose stools. I didn't have any. Could this product from amazon could be counterfeit?"
3,Got to stick to the rules or else!!!,"It is a good product IF you follow the rules exactly. No more than 15 grams of fat at each of 3 meals. The Alli will absorb about 1/2 of the 15 grams. Make a couple snacks fat free and you can easiily eat 5 times a day. However, if you go off Alli, you will probably gain a little back.If you stick to the 15 grams per meal (you were only getting 7.5 with the Alli), then you are eating twice the fat you were before, so you will gain. If you go off it for a binge, boy will you gain it FAST!!! I think once I finish my bottle, I'll save myself a ton of money and just do my diet the right way. Senisble eating and exercise. Yes, it may be slower, but I stand a better chance of keeping the weight off and I'll save a bunch money towards the gas tank and healthier food."
3,Be sure to have a toilet brush handy,"This product does just as it says. You WILL regret those fatty foods sooner or later. Don't think you can eat what you want because the pill will get rid of it. Once you take these pills and have a meal of fried chicken for example you will regret it. Run to the bathroom (if you make it) and get ready to spill out foul smelling orange oils. The oils are visable in the water and once you flush it tends to cling inside the toliet. It will make you want to eat less fat, that is for sure. If you are an emotional eater I do not suggest this for you. You will be in the bathroom most of the day. Get the toliet brush and some bleach ready......you will need it! You may also want to take a vitamin. I felt rather weak and ill just 3 weeks after use. I did lose a few pounds. You should also get some woist wipes because the oil likes to stick to your..um hind quarters. If you don't your underwear may get stained."
1,Gross side effects,Nasty side affects and no results you will fart and grease will come out of your butt so discusting would not buy again
5,Works Great!,I've used this for a while and it keeps working as long as you do. You cannot expect miracles overnight but it helps you lose more than you would with diet and exercise alone..
2,So-so,"I found Alli only moderately helpful and not worth purchasing again.It only seemed to work for me sometimes, only occasionally workingagainst the fat in my system."
3,The item i never received,"I never received the item. I had to get a refund because the seller never responded to my inquiries. I have used Alli and it worked fairly well for a few months, but my system got used to it. I ordered it to see if an abstinence would allow my system to rebound. unfortunately, i'm still waiting to see."
1,Will no longer spend $60 & up for sugar pills?,"This product worked wonderfully for me before it came off market in spring of 2012. I gained most of my weight back & was thrilled when it was back on the market in August of 2012. I saw the weight come off the first two weeks & then nothing. No oily residue in my stool, nothing! I bought another bottle in October & same thing. I am through paying money for sugar pills & I hope others will stop as well!"
3,Alli,"Can make your muscles sore from straining! Blocks some fat absorption, but hasn't had a significant effect on weight loss."
1,Alli. Price gouging! Shame!,"There is a nation-wide shortage on Alli. Why, I do not know? It has been out on Rx since 2000. I visited England in 2000 and the physicians were angered by the company trying to market it there for weight loss, because it did not work well. It is the only med that has cured my constipation side of Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Because, that was life-changing for me, I paid hundreds of dollars per month per Rx for years. I never lost weight! Finally, it went to over-the-counter and there has been a run to purchase Alli, causing a nationwide shortage? (So, say the pharmacies.) Now anyone still having Alli is selling it at a much higher price! Why? People can we never learn from our mistakes? We have a bad economy so let's just cheat people is how this appears to me!"
4,Gives Incentive To Eat Right,"I have been taking Orlistat off and on for a few years. I think it does give you a big incentive to eat low fat foods. Because when you do eat meals with a lot of fat, these pills will let you know, by means of going the bathroom thing so many have mentioned. My advise is cut down trying to fart like you use to. The people that mentioned leakage occurred at the worst times like at a meeting. My advice is don't fart when your in meetings. The only time I ever had that happened is when I got fart happy and let em rip forgetting that these pills aren't going to allow that"
2,eeew grose,"make sure you read the side effects... yea it happens... where a maxi... Ladies, front to back..."
3,"Worked before, doesn't anymore","I used alli for a year- before it dissappeared from the market- and saw great results; I lost over 20 pounds. I've just bought my first bottle since it became affordable again and now I'm not seeing any results. I will acknowledge that I have only been using it for a month so far, and maybeI will see some results in the next month. But I'm wondering if something is different in the formula now that makes it not as effective. All in all, alli is more effective than any of the other popular weight loss aids on the market, but I'm still disappointed by it."
3,it's ok,"It helps somewhat, causes a lot of stomach aches and nausea. Havn't lost any weight, but havn't gained any either. Too expensive for the little bit it does."
1,rellenas de polvo blanco....,"Mi problema no es con las pastillas alli,es con la distribuidora Bargain OTC,que me mando capsulas llenas de yo no se que mugrrero,pero no eran las alli originales,porque yo tomo estas por mucho tiempo y las compro en Amazon y es la primera vez que no me trabajan y para comprobarlo fuy y compre unas ala farmacia y las abri y no tenian el mismo contenido las capsulas y estas si me empezaron a trabajar,solo cuidado con la compania,que escojan porque hay algunas que nos pueden matar."
1,a total waste of money,"I bought this product after reading various medical reviews, that it was reasonably safe, and seemed to work for lots people, not just the 10 people hired by the company to promote the product. I followed all the directions, and even signed up on the website. I have been eating the number of calories they suggested, started walking for an hour a day, and taken the pills exactly as directed. I guess a good thing is I haven't seen too many of the side effects, but bottom line, I have lost 1 pound...in a MONTH!! I probably could have done this without spending money on these very expensive useless pills."
3,I did not lose any weight.,"I could see the fat coming out in my poop, but I guess it wasn't enough to cause actual weight loss."
2,Don't Pay the Expedited Delivery Fee - Seller uses Post Office,"This is more a seller review. They use the post office for delivery - even the supposedly expedited 2 day service for a hefty $20 fee. Of course, delivery is not within the 2 days of normal Amazon shipments that come via UPS or FedEx. Rather, the delivery is within 2 BUSINESS days. Well, that yields a delivery time of 4 or 5 real time days if the order is close to a weekend.I feel cheated for paying the expedited fee. I could have purchased the same product for less money but with an upcoming trip I could not wait the 4 or 5 days quoted for normal delivery (for $5 shipping fee).Amazon should also include the method of shipment in the order details. Given my individual situation of having different delivery addresses depending on the method of shipment it would make things much easier."
4,Ali purchase,"I was able to match my best purchase price and the product was shipped to my home address. I would have loved to have free shipping as an option, but still a great price"
2,Doesn't seem to be the same,"I purchased ALLI last year around this time (getting ready for bikini weather) through drugstore dot com and I am not sure if ALLI changed it's product (doesn't show change on label) or if the seller is not selling a real ALLI product. Either way I am very disappointed in this product, doesn't seem to have the same effects that it did last time I took it when you have high fat foods. Anyone who has taken ALLI knows exactly what I am talking about. While no one wants these effects, it's part of the whole ""make sure your eating heathly or else"" plan that makes people on ALLI sucessful. NO ONE wants to have the side effects, so you do what you need to do so that this doesn't happen. No such luck with this product this time around. Need to buy from another site to see if it's the seller or the product."
4,Great if you can follow directions,"I hear a lot of people complaining about the ""treatment effects"" of this drug. But if you have a little willpower and can follow simple instructions, the fact is that it works. I have been taking it for 10 months and have lost 75 pounds. Obviously, you need to exercise and you should be doing that anyway."
1,save your money,"I could not tell any difference at all in using this product. If there is not a lot of fat in your diet, nothing changes."
3,Not that great,"It does block fat, I'll give it that. However, I have weighed myself once a week and I have somehow gained 4 pounds eventhough I eat less and excer. daily. I don't get it? I don't really think it helped me at all."
3,Undecided about Alli,"I have been taking Alli for about 4 weeks (I started my lifesyle change a week before I started Alli)and I have lost 18 pounds. However, I can't say that it is because of the Alli since I've had these same kind of results from Weight Watchers. I weigh and measure everything and keep a food journal. My calories never exceed 1200 per day and fat grams are always less than 15 PER DAY. As a result, I have never had treatment effects; and I think those that are, are just eating too much FAT. This is not a magic pill. You have to make the commitment to change how you eat and how much. This is hard work and Alli is not going to do it for you."
2,Alli OTC Weight Loss Medication,"I purchased this the day it became available over the counter in hopes it might help me finally lose a bit. I've taken it exactly as the directions state. Yes, there are very unpleasant side effects which can almost be hard to control, which are described in their literature, but luckily I was able to. I also take Metamucil pills with each dose, which lessens the side effects. I've taken them religiously for a whole month now, but it doesn't seem to be having any affect on my body losing any weight. I do know it works for many people, but I guess as with any drug, everyone reacts differently."
1,Got a completely phony batch,"I read a couple reviews saying there are phony batches out there, but all the reviews seemed to be from a few years back, so I took my chances. Well, the pills I received did absolutely nothing, despite coming in a sealed bottle in a sealed box, complete with that little ""Getting Started"" booklet and everything. Whatever the hell was in mine has actually made me go to the bathroom LESS than before I started taking it."
2,New Release NOT Working! Anyone Else Experiencing this?,"I've been taking Alli daily since 2009! With the product being hard-to-find, I stopped in February. I've since waited anxiously for its return. I, also, while waiting anxiously, kept busy by gaining 20 lbs back :0( I've been taking it since it's been back on the shelves and doubled the dose to use it in its prescription strength form. I can state, as someone who's a firm believer in it, that it is NOT working at all like it did. Is anyone else experiencing this?"
4,Walmart.com has this for $75 with free shipping!!!,"Don't let these amazon sellers steal your money! Walmart.com sells this for $75 with free shipping. That being said, this product works well and you do have to be careful about what you eat or you'll suffer the consequences :)"
1,FAKE Alli product?,"I purchased this product and have been taking it and working out and doing all the right things. I have not seen a result. I have also not seen any side effects. So last night I had a VERY high-fat meal and would not normally risk taking one of these pills with a meal with such high fat. But I ""tested"" it and NOTHING happened. Therefore, I'm going to assume that the pill either is fake (a placebo) or is only half-filled. I opened one and it was NOT filled to the top. So I've basically wasted time and money on this product and it's too late to return it. I don't think it's ""Alli"" itself but just the batch that I bought."
4,"Like most things, Alli is what you make of it","I've used the Rx version of Alli, Xenical, on and off for several years. If your willing to deal with some of the ""treatment effects"" of orlistat, it works reasonably well. Personally, I didn't see as much benefit of 60mg (1 capsule) as I did with 120mg (2 capsules). You need to be careful what you eat, since the worst treatment effects come when you eat meals with too much fat. If you're willing to make some changes to your diet and exercise patterns, Alli will help you loose weight. My suggestion is to stick with Alli for a while. Alli will help you loose weight if you're willing to follow the Alli plan."
4,good product,"I have been using Alli now for about a month. I have hashimoto's disease and no thyroid gland so my metabolism is almost zero. I have been on a low calorie diet for a couple of months now. Even though I am slow at losing weight I have been able to lose six pounds with the help of Alli. I haven't had any side effects yet, but I am on a really low fat diet. I make sure I don't eat any high fat, so as not to experience any of the side effects of Alli when eating more than 15 grams of fat. At the beginning of this diet I only lost two pounds the first month and then I began talking Alli. This month I lost four pounds and that is a lot for me. I am sure someone with a normal metabolism could do much better.I believe this to be a good product based on my experiences so far.Carol A. Moore"
3,orlistat,"Not as strong as the prescription weight loss pill(xenical), but I have lost 2 to 3 pounds already. Some cramping, and bloating but not severe as long as you are prepared for it. Some of the gas will stain your underpants!! Be aware of that. Overall a good safe product, which does not affect mood, and with minimal interaction with other medications. I intend to reorder it."
5,Wacky!!!,This book is absolutely hilarious. It only takes a couple of sentences to figure out what it's about and a couple more before you're thinking of your own entry. You'll laugh. Alot.
5,La Cucaracha!,"I highly recommend that any person interested in politics and Latinos take a look at Migra Mouse, a collection of editorial cartoons by Lalo Alcaraz, the artist behind the daily comic strip La Cucaracha. The cartoons cover politics from the last decade with an emphasis on Latinos and immigration. Alcaraz has a simple but effective drawing style that says more with a few pen strokes than a political pundit with a book contract. Alcaraz is one of the sharpest political cartoonists around today. By the way, I'm Anglo and I don't always agree with Mr. Alcaraz's point of view, but I'm here to say that regardless of your skin tone, political bent, or favorite flavor of Christmas tamale, you shouldn't ignore this wonderful cartoonist."
1,Second worst DVD I have ever seen.,"If you are wondering, the worst DVD I've seen is ""The Ultimate Space Experience."" This movie is still pretty bad though. I bought it invisioning a lot of big atomic bomb explosions. How could I be more wrong. One. Only one atomic bomb explosion happened during the entire flick. This DVD would only be useful for some kind of research paper, or maybe skeet shooting, not that I've ever tried that. Anyway, if you are planning on buying this, think twice, it's no good.Unlike the Ultimate Space Experience, I give this a one star rating, as opposed to zero. Screw Flanders. End."
1,Really Bad,"A big disappointment.The images are not very excitingWriting is horrible, Narration will put you to sleep, Picture quality stinksI suggest Trinity and Beyond on DVD. Of all my DVD's it is my favorite and includes a 3D extra."
5,Confortable,I have gifted this shoes to my mother thinking in her delicates foots. She said feel confortable and happy whe used this sandals. We recommend it to every bady who wants take care her foots.
5,Cruisin' Route 66,"I didn't know anything about Route 66 when Amanda and I left Chicago bound for Las Vegas. This book was very informative and the precise driving directions were a real help. Rt. 66 CANNOT be traveled without a guidebook of this type.The book led us to all sorts of interesting people and places. We stopped and chatted with Lucille Harmon in Hydro, OK and Juan Delgado at the Sno-Cap in Seligman, AZ. These were places that I would have never known about were it not for this book. (12/7/2004: God rest their souls.)If you choose to travel Rt. 66, be sure to have this book and stick to the two-lane original road all the way."
3,A good general guide,"This is a good book to people who want to have an overview at a glance about call centers features and problems. But, according to new economy habits, it is not a technological issue. So, if many points are discussed, such as human resources, real estate, organisation, hardware and products, none of them is focused in a detailed way. It is surely a very good introduction to people starting a new job in call centers environments, but do not expect too much by readin it."
2,Call Center Review,Very theoretical. Not much help for daily operations. It's more a strategic book on call center planning. Still was useful on some equipment buying decision.
5,A Classroom In A Book,"The way Keith Dawson handles the materials is well-written and concise. He does not waste much time going into more than just a couple real-world applications for the technologies he is explaining, but he does set your mind spinning about how they can be used to suit your needs. The information on VoIP and IP Telephony are a little dated and an updated edition would obviously expand a lot on those technologies (which were just emerging when the book was written but have become very popular in the industry now). Not only does he discuss what technologies are available (like AVR, IP-PBX, Recording, Call Queuing, etc.), he goes into a brief discription of the more traditional PBX system, if only to point out their flaws compared to today's newer technology but not failing to point out their merits as well. A good book for someone who is just beginning to integrate themselves in the field and the tech."
1,Baloney,Just an FYI that the previous reviewer's reviews are all for the same company - must be skeptical of all reviews!
2,Sticks,"Didn't like it all! The waffles stick and pull apart when trying to remove them (Yes, I sprayed with oil first). My hope was to make a batch of waffles and freeze some to pop in the toaster later (Saving time in the morning). Well, of course, they were so small the toaster ""swallowed"" them. Had to dig them out with a fork (After unpluging the toaster). When I stood it upright, the top kept falling open etc.etc.etc. Anyway, returned it and ordered a different one. Much happier with this one....and it's cheaper. It's the T-Fal Avante. It has removable plates for cleaning and also has plates for sandwich melts etc. Sooo... good luck!!"
4,Works great but one little problem,"I loved this waffler from the first time I saw it. It works great and the waffles are excellent. My only problem is that when it arrived the little plastic pieces that cover the ""on"" and ""ready"" lights were broken and had fallen out. Now this could have been faulty shipping or faulty design...I am not sure which. You can put the plastic pieces back over the lights and they will sit there, that is until you turn the waffler over to put in or remove the cord. Other than that...this product rocks."
5,Great Product,"In an age when there are so many shoddy products being sold, this unit is a stand out. I have used it for over two years, almost every week and it has consistently produced great waffles. It is easy to clean and the nice feature of storing the cord under the body is most useful."
4,Love this little waffle maker!,"My family loves this waffle maker. We liberally spray it with Pam before each batch so we have had no problems with sticking. My only complaint is that the top of the waffle does not fully form so it does not look perfect. But this may be the waffle batter I am using- we just got it so have only tried one kind. I also love how quickly the waffles cook- it's really easy to make enough for a family of four, quickly. The chirp is a little annoying, but oh well! The small size is so nice."
5,Awesome Waffle maker - Use mine for Gluten Free Waffles,I got this waffle maker from my daughter for Christmas. It makes perfect waffles everytime. Use non-stick spray and heat it up it chirps. Put your waffle mixture in let it cook and it chirps again when they are ready. I love the crust gauge so you can decide it you want them lighter or darker.It couldn't be easier. It is a high quality waffle maker. I have an old one of another brand that would only work proper every third time. I love the little baby belgian waffles. I make some to eat immediately and I also freeze some for later.I use mine with Pamela's Gluten Free Baking Mix and follow the recipe on the package. They are the best waffles I've ever eaten. My adult kids ate them before I told them they were gluten free.
2,Tedious with Gratuitous Obscurity,"I wanted to enjoy this book. The premise is interesting. The author is fascinated by Ibn Battutah and his travels. He sets off to follow in IB's footsteps. The author draws references from many bizarre sources presumably to help clarify or explain some of his experiences, but what it ends up being is gratuitous obscurity. I carefully sought out his references, but I did not feel rewarded. I noted with interest how often the author clarified that he was not married and did not wish to be and that he is not a Muslim and did not wish to be. These two issues arose many times. I was interested in the Eye of Joy and a couple of his jokes, but overall I felt the author was trying to impress the reader with his wide knowledge of obscurity rather than share an experience with his reader."
2,Ibn Battutah couldn't have been this dull,"I've spent some time in Tangier, where Ibn Battutah is still a well-known name after a lot of centuries, and was happy to see that someone had produced a new look in English on the subject. Regrettably, the focus of this effort is more on the author, Timothy Macintosh-Smith himself than on the intrepid traveler Ibn Battutah. I've no doubt that Mackintosh-Smith is a well-educated and experienced Arabist, but his writing style in this short book is not only stilted and pretentious, it's frequently closeminded and (to my mind) unfair to the alleged subject. There are occasional insights worth having here, but overall, this is not a book that I would recommend."
1,How bad can it get ?,"I am very literate, educated and well traveled.I have read over 40,000 pages a year for twenty years, and have written a book. I never made it past page 85 of this messy manuscript. The overuse of prentious words was amazing, and the whole book, which could have been intresting was boring beyond belief. Give it a skip!"
5,Very Entertaining!,"I bought this CD based on the audio samples and when it arrived I was not disappointed. Henry Rollins is very funny very obnoxious at times but overall a great story teller who keeps you interested throughout the CD. My favorite tracks are, The Gay thing, Marius , Airport Hell and Russia. He definitely has a style which draws you in. I wish I could see him live. In the meantime I will buy more of his Albums. I wonder how his poetry is like."
5,Brutally funny and inspiring,This is an album that i'd given out years ago to be passed around to everyone I know and beyond . Henry is a master storyteller and able to make a person laugh as well as think . Not for the easily offended though .
5,Hank returns with another great collection of wisdom,"In a day when Baz Luhrmann is considered a poetic genius to the soccer moms of the nation, it is to everyone's advantage to seek out the spoken truths of Henry Rollins, especially as featured on his latest release, Think Tank. His anecdotes and travel tales alternate between the hilarious and the profound, from self-depreciating stories of forgetting song lyrics,to a touching encounter with a terminally ill fan, Henry's experiences, masterfully told, will crack you up and make you think. This is one of Henry's most diverse spoken word albums, and worthy of everybody's interest!!! A Beat poet for the 90s!!"
1,What was the production team thinking?,"There were some really good fights on this event. I only wish they would have shown them in their entirety. For some reason the production team decided to run a graphic announcing the round number for the first fifteen seconds of each round - meaning you don't get to see the first fifteen second of the round. During many of the rounds you are missing opening punches and kicks, and in one case they are on the ground when the graphic goes away. However, and this is what sent me to my keyboard in a rage, there is a nineteen second TKO in one of the fights (I won't spoil and tell you which one). Basically what you see is the graphic announcing Round One for fifteen seconds with the commentators going crazy, then the graphic disappears and you see the ref running in to stop the fight. I'll probably regret this hasty review at a later date, but right now I'm furious. What could they possibly be thinking by doing that? Arrrgghh!"
3,ONE PERFORMANCE...MORE?,"I have no live CD's in my collection, mainly because i tend to see them as a second-rate greatest hits compilation, not sounding that good and with all of the possible live mistakes vocals get into.Obviously some of these objections do not relate to Barbra, that's why i have all of her live CD's, still i do not think she really outshines here.Sure, the album and performance took place to campaign for good causes - and that only should be worth the price of the CD alone... - but if she wanted to put a live CD on the market after all those years of self-hiatus from stage, she should have gone for a longer program at least...There are positive aspects nevertheless fir the die-hard Streisand fans : she performs very nicely three songs not appearing on any album before (OVER THE RAINBOW, IT'S A NEW WORLD and AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL) and gives you the chance to testify via your cd player what other VIP's paid very dearly to see live on stage by invitation....what better bargain?"
3,One voice,"I just bought this CD for $11.98 from Amazon.com. The list price is now $7.99. Does that mean I was overcharged or was shipping cost hidden in my price? I did not see it was a recording of her concert so there was clapping, etc which I don't like. I would be more careful before purchasing something again."
2,I love Barbra but this stinks,"Barbra is fabulous no doubt about it, however its clear to the listener that this was her first major concert in 20 years, because she sounds totally unprepared for it. She cant hold any of her long notes without screeching them, or merely cutting them short. Her breathing is irregular even with teh first number she sounds out of breath. Her nervousness makes her voice wavery, and her high notes thin. I mean Barbra, the ultimate perfectionist, even hits some flat notes, it was shocking she NEVER hits flat notes. The only moderately good cuts were Somewhere over the rainbow, send in the clowns and People, but only because those songs didnt require any heft. All the songs that required some effort she manages to blow. If you want to her real concert magic buy ""Barbra: The Concert Live from Madison Square Garden"", its absolute brilliance and shows how many of the songs on this album should have been performed."
2,Hitch not for Toyota Tacoma,"Reese Towpower / Cequent Consumer Products, Inc. says that this hitch is not recommended for any Toyota Tacoma. It does not fit 2004 Toyota Tacoma, as the convenient product usage verifier says. Instead you should buy Reese product 33025."
3,Before they were stars.....,"P-Funk fans beware. This was when George Clinton and crew sounded like a mix of Jimi Hendrix, Motown, and the Beatles and it goes down (for the most part) like mustard and ice cream. ""Don't Be Sore At Me"" has a kinda quirky appeal and stays in your head longer than you want it to, though."
5,Books should be like this,"This is a great book (as good as the rest in the series). The kind of book that is part of the solution, not part of the problems of the world... Excellent for kids and adults."
4,Great Book,The Mystery Of The Green Gohst is a good book about 3 boys that are after a mystery and it only seems to get worse! When the boys go out for the day on horseback it could never get worse.And a wonderful thought that a ghost is creeping around the house. A wonderful book and a good storyline. I am guessing It should be read by older elementry students 3-6. I enjoyed It!
3,haven't watched it yet..lol,Sorry folks. Haven't watched it yet so how can I?I'm just being honest...ok?I'm also looking to watching it
1,Kick Boxing dud,The sometimes animated or recorded at slow speed and played back fast kick boxing provided some super action. While 90% of the movie was one kick boxing/fight after another there was very little story to fill in the remaining 10% with the poor acting and sound. This is a low budget failure. Sorry but take no-doz when watching this movie.
3,A Substitute if You're Waiting for the next Stephanie Plum,"The similarities between Pauline Sokol and Stephanie Plum have already been discussed by other reviewers. The book on the whole wasn't bad although I did get tired of the constant stupidity of Pauline -- she was a nurse for years, she can't be that dumb. What eventually annoyed me the most though was the constant (and I mean CONSTANT) inner monologue about Jagger (Ranger) and how she could neither function or utter an intelligent sentence in his presence."
3,Well....,"Unfortunately, I wasn't too impressed with this title. I muddled my way through chapter five but was unable to finish. Although the premise of the book was a good one (burnt out nurse becomes a P.I.), something about the character of Pauline Sokol just irritated me. Others might find it a lot more enjoyable than I did, though!"
2,"""Ack""","Too many similarities to a Stephanie Plum book for me to get past and enjoy this book. Maybe,if I had never read the Stephanie Plum series...maybe, if Pauline didn't say ""Ack"" so much...maybe, if Pauline wasn't so dumb...then maybe, just maybe I would have given it 3 stars. The story is ok. It's just too close to something that is much better to deserve much interest from me."
1,"No mystery, no plot","This is a lesson to me not to buy two books by the same author at once until you have read at least one first. The only mystery here is how it ever got published. The plot is on the back cover. If you read any more, you get 305 pages of a narrator/character who can't manage film in her camera (film? in 2004?), charging her cell phone, and finding her keys. This from a woman who is supposed to have been a nurse for 12 years. Find the medication? Find the chart? Find the patient? To some people may be funny. Perhaps I have just spent too much of my time sorting other people's chaos to find it entertaining or relaxing. If you like a good mystery try something by Catherine Aird. Or spend the $6.99 on lunch. Wish I had."
3,EEK! ACK! EGADS!,"If 1/2 stars were possible my rating would go up.This was my first book with this author and it won't be my last. I disagree with another reviewer as I thought Pauline's bumbling around as an apprentice sleuth made for some interesting situations. She reminds me of a beginning Stephanie Plum and her cast of supporting characters.However, the author needs to get rid of ""ACK"". It was used way too much and took away from the flow of the story. Beyond that I think with some seasoning Ms Sokol's adventures will become even more entertaining."
2,Not sure if I want to read more faux Plum,"As many others have said, this is a poor clone of the Stephanie Plum series. Almost every Plum character has a match in this book, and it was disappointing. The book itself had a good story line. I enjoy laugh out loud books; this one didn't provide much, but did have some amusing scenes. I had to mentally stop myself from reading ""Ranger"" when the character was ""Jagger"".Overall, I was very disappointed. I will read the reviews from her future books to see if she has managed to get over her Plum fixation, and has expanded the storylines to include other characters."
4,Entertaining and Fun,"An interesting, amusing book with well-developed, likable characters. Pauline is looking for a new career and switches from nursing to medical insurance fraud investigation. In the process, she encounters some interesting personalities, among them her roommate Miles and his friend Goldie, as well as two attractive men. Pauline begins to learn her new trade but not without mishap - there are several humorous incidents. I liked this book well enough to start right in on the second when I finished it. If you like the Janet Evanovitch Plum series, you will enjoy this book as well. It is well-written, quick-paced and fun and gives you enough insight into the characters to make them seem real."
3,Like Reading a Stephanie Plum Book,"Pauline is another Stephanie Plum. She's an inexperienced, blumbling investigator. While Stephanie is a bounty hunter, Pauline is a insurance investigator. Both have families that figure in the book. The father in both is a quiet man and the mother cooks all the time. Stephanie has a Grandmother and Pauline has an uncle. They both have gay men who help them. They both have high profile men in their lives who they really know nothing about. Stephanie has Ranger and Pauline has Jagger. It's like Stephanie has stepped into Pauline's body and took over. It's an enjoyable read except I kept comparing it to a Stephanie Plum book. Think maybe the author had read a little too much Stephanie Plum and couldn't come up with a plot totally her own. Not sure if I'll read any more of her books."
2,Stephanie Plum slums.....,I searched the reviews and was glad to see someone put into words exactly what I was thinking the whole time I read this book. The whole story read like a Plum imitation from dinner at the parents house to the mysterious stranger/perfect man! I don't know how Ms. Avocato gets away with publishing a book that she hardly had to write!
2,A Stephanie Plum wannabe,"Although Sokol attempts to develop a comedic character, I felt it was a POOR imitation of Janet Evanovich's ""Stephanie Plum"". She even has a ""mysterious, handsome man"" (hmmm.. Ranger?), it just isn't working. Her characters are not well-developed, as well as the plot. Sure, there are some funny moments in the book, but all in all, I was not impressed. I will give her another try since this is her first book."
2,A big disappointment,"While the main character, Pauline Sokol seems like a fun character at the outset of the book. - she is an incredibly incompetant sleuth that makes you cringe with every obvious mistake she makes. She is supposed to be a medical insurance fraud investigator - but not a very good one. From sitting plainly in front of the person's house she is watching - to consistenly forgetting survellence cameras - it is infuriating. It is hard to concentrate on the story line when the main character is doing everything in her power to place obstacles in her own path.I did enjoy the supporting characters alot - but the heroine was just not believable at all."
4,Standard Folding Utility Knife,I have purchased several different brands and they are all about the same. Great price on this one though.
3,"great idea, lousy execution","prosit was inexpensiveits a lockback folding knifeeasy to storeeasy to change bladesconsclasping mechanism doesnt always seem to want to stay put, you can tighten and adjust as much as you want but it still falls open when it wants to.blade holder swivel very stiff at first, now too loose"
1,If You Can't Change The Blade...,...The knife is not worth having. Other brands are much better and blade changes are simple and quick.
2,Sub-par,"Cool looking anodized and switch-blade-style handle, but the hinges and the grooves made for replacing the blade is made poorly. The blade will stay in place but the blade cover won't lock. The switch-blade style doesn't open-up like a real switch-blade would using the thumb. Very stiff. but since it's not a *weapon* who cares?"
2,Blade Changes Ridiculous,Don't buy this thing. Changing the blade is just nuts. People who review this favorably likely have done so before time to change a blade.
5,Very Good - Very Durable - Very Nice Looking,"This is a very good utility knife. I have been using for about a month now - every work day. We have been working outdoors (Carpentry-Framing) its been very cold and wet. Have been using for cutting a lot of exterior sheetrock, sharpening pencils and cutting Tyvek. it hasn't showed any signs of rust, wear or stress.Design advantages:Its very strong.Nice looking.less than half the size of all my old Stanley knives.Tool-less blade replacement.easy to handle... at least for my small hands.Disadvantages:Doesn't hold spare blades... But does come with a small separate box for replacemnet blades.Opening and Closing knife requires both hands.All in all best utility knife I have owned for the last 7 years that I have been framing houses."
2,Nice when it's free,"This is an OK utility knife, but if you are looking for a quality tool, buy the original, the SuperKnife. The only reason I got this knife was because it was a freebie, and that's about the right price for this knife.As far as reviewing the functionality, the action is very stiff when trying to open the knife and requires the use of both hands. When I try to flip it open with the thumscrew, I frequently open the blade change mechanism. And on that note, blade changes aren't that easy to perform, either.If you can get this knife $5 or less, then it might be worth it; otherwise, go for the SuperKnife."
5,"Thought it'd be cheap and junky, but it is pretty NICE!!!","I got this in a ""3 tools for the price of 2"" deal. I thought it's be fairly junky given the price. Boy was I wrong! The quality and finish is REALLY nice. Good secure lock in the open position, and folds down to a FRACTION of the size of a normal utility knife. It has the feel of a small pocket knife, yet you can go ahead and trash the blade, since it refills with standard utility knife blades. I ended up buying a second one, so I always have one in arms reach."
3,"Great knife,but hard to open with one hand.","Just as the title suggests.I do like the fact that they supply a good amount of replacement blades.The lock is incredibly strong.Ijust wish it would be easier to open,it is a cut risk."
1,This player eats my tapes,"I agree with Judge Judy...This thing eats my tapes when I hit play, and then it keeps turning itself off..grrr. I bought another player today at the local Walgrens."
2,Misleading technical details,The technical details are wrong. This product absolutely does NOT have an external microphone jack. It was a great inconvenience to find this out after I had received the product.
1,"THIS IS ""NOT"" A MINI CASSETTE RECORDER, BUYER BEWARE","This recorder is NOT a mini recorder as sellers advertise, it is in fact a small recorder but takes conventional large cassettes, not mini cassettes.feel free to look at the rca link to see for yourself. It only says tape recorder, no mention of mini, sellers add mini to the listing.http://www.rcaaudiovideo.com/product.aspx?product=5&post;=51"
1,Doesn't Work,"Maybe if you buy the formula Works, I try many times the formula used in the book, but i didn'd any good result.I try the web site, but .....the same"
1,ISBN 978-1479125777 A terrible edition,"Survival in Auschwitz is, of course, a crucial work that does not require my praise in an Amazon review. This edition, however, is shamefully bad. From the obscene, exploitative cover photo to the misprintings and typos on nearly every page,everything about this ""independently published"" version is terrible. I cannot stress enough how wretched the ISBN 978-1479125777 edition is, and how offensive it is that such an important book by such a brilliant writer should appear in such a brazenly sloppy edition."
1,Textual Errors,"""Survival in Auschwitz"" by Primo Levi is an important book for many reasons. It was therefore disappointing to find so many textual errors. This is a careless reprinting and does a disservice to both the author and the first-time reader.If you wish to understand human nature, ""Survival in Auschwitz"" is mandatory reading. However, avoid purchasing this edition."
3,A little more philisophical than facts,"I can't give a low review on someone's holocaust survival story. It just isn't just to grade one's experience over another. I can however state that I didn't care for the manner in which this book was written.I have read a TON of holocaust books, as I enjoy researching this horrible time in history, but this story was not very organized. The author did state that the story was not sequential, so one should be aware of that fact.The author went on many tangents and seemed to philosophize small insignificant detail. Perhaps, this is a fault of my own, the reader?If you are a first time holocaust story reader, don't read this, yet. This is just my humble opinion."
1,Terrible edition of Levi's great masterpiece,"This edition of Levi's book is an insult to the memory of a great writer. Not only is the translation inept, the editing sloppy (multiple typos), and the format kitschy, but--and this is unconscionable--the publishers have excised Levi's Introduction and his great poem which precede the text. This is a disgrace. Hayden White"
1,Don't buy this edition,"This edition appears to be a Print-On-Demand situation where the publisher has had a computer perform a very bad spelling and grammatical check, making the experience of reading this classic quite annoying and inappropriately laughable.(One example of many: ""We saw a large door with assign above it. Brightly it illuminated (its memory still strikes me in my dreams): Arbeit Macht Frei."" (p. 17)Buy an edition where a publishing house has actually paid a HUMAN to copy edit and proofread the text. Even if it costs more. I wish I hadn't gone for the bargain on this one."
3,Primo: Still a Man,"I'm not a fan of Holocaust narrative, mostly because I've read and been forced to read in school many of this type of novel. Primo's memoir, however, sticks in my mind unlike any other. What makes Survival in Auschwitz, aka If This Is A Man, unique is the complete objectivity he writes with. He records only fact, expressing no emotion whatsoever. The effect is unsentimental and wholly horrific. His role is a recorder of events for posterity, and asks the reader to judge for his/herself the morality of what took place in the camp, not only the actions of the Nazi guards but also the prisoners themselves. He lets the reader decide whether he retained his humanity in the face of complete dehuminization. If all you know of the Holocaust is contained in Anne Frank's The Diary of a Young Girl, it might benefit you to pick this one up."
1,unprofessional edition,"The book I received was an unprofessional reproduction of Primo Levi's classic work (publisher: Classic House Books) - the book contained many spelling errors, improper formatting, and missing footnotes. I'd stay away from this publisher. (The book itself - the writing - is excellent and highly recommended)."
5,A Truly Important Work,"Because this is one of the most important books of the 20th Century, it grieves me that the publisher couldn't even bother to check for spelling and typographical errors (e.g., recieve, openely). It's also too bad that the title had to be changed from IF THIS IS A MAN, because the original title better sums up the subject. The writer was a great man! I feel privileged to read his account of how men were willfully denuded by their captors of everything that makes one human. No one may fairly judge those who did whatever it took, merely to be able to go on breathing. I am thankful for Levi's courage in writing this book; all we have to hold on to is the truth."
5,Loved it!,"I love this book, I have read it in other languages as well. I must say, You have to be ready to cry and picture some terrible things. don't buy if you can't handle."
2,Good Levi; irksome title change,"I can't stand publishers (who could it be but the publisher? no honest translator would dare) who change perfectly good titles in an attempt to pander to a certain market--in this case to the mass market for Hollywood Holocaust fare like __Sophie's Choice__ and __Schindler's List__. Nobody who knows Levi would need a title like __Survival in Auschwitz__ to know what his book is about, and those who don't know him are likely to be put off, as I was for a long time, by a title cooked up by a bunch of idiots in a marketing department.I recommend reading an edition that translates the original, much more evocative title word for word: __If This Is a Man__. And don't forget to read __The Truce__ as well. Its last chapter is all the more powerful after a reading of both books."
3,Tragic Story... Tragic Writing Ability,"Primo Levi's Story tears at your heart, but so does his ability as a writer. His tale is informative, and truthful. It gives us deep insight into the world of Auschwitz, the most terrible Concentration Camp in Nazi Germany... Levi just isn't a writer. If you are a fanatic of this period in history, and particularly this aspect of the war, give the book a try, it will add to your knowledge, it just wont be a fun process."
1,Get the touchstone edition instead!,"This edition is a cheap OCR edition with frequent, deeply embarrassing typos and a faulty layout made by a machine rather than a typesetter (no human ever proofread this edition). Get the Touchstone edition instead for more or less the same price. It has a great introduction and--as a bonus--a conversation between Primo Levi and Philip Roth."
4,A clinical memoir of the Holocaust -- and that's good,"A touching, but not mawkish or dramatic, memoir. One realizes the randomness and happenstance by which he survived, and easily accepts the moral dualism of the life of thievery and connivance, within bounds of common decency and collective group self-interest, that kept any survivor alive. Some reviews seemed to fault the book for being unemotional, but one sees how Levi's essentially scientific and objective personality became a key to his survival, and necessarily informs his voice."
4,Brought a new aspect on how the Nazis treated others,"This book really brought a new aspect on how I see the Nazis and how the treated others in their concentration camps. There was a part that really stood out to me, when Levi was standing and watching the kids play and hang their clothes on the barbed wire fences. This showed me how even through the worst of times people can still live their life and be happy. This book was very good and how it went into great detail of how he lived his life and how he had to work to earn anything in the camp. It is very ironic how a young chemist in his prime could go from living in a normal life to not being able to do anything or make any choices on what to do. This really shows how one must have high tollerance to get through almost anything."
5,Details we take for granted,"What makes Primo Levi's account of life in Monowitz so amazing is the immediacy of it all: he speaks in the present tense, as if all this is happening again, now. For Levi, it's not in the past, was never in the past.That, and the little things that we take for granted. Here, the water is not drinkable. And the fit of one's clogs can be a matter of life or death. One must not talk.One finds oneself in the blue and icy snow of dawn, barefoot and naked, with all one's clothing in hand and one hundred yards to go to the next hut, where one may finally get dressed.Another thing Levi understands: it can always be worse, and that for most everyone, it does get worse. When readers finish this book, they understand an iota of what Levi suffered, what all the vanquished innocents suffered.--Alyssa A. Lappen"
1,This edition (Classic House's) is a failure,"This is one of the great books in Western Literature. That being said, the edition published by Classic House is absolute junk! There are typographical errors all over the place. Every other page has a mistake. Additionally, the way that the text is justified is terrible; there are large spaces between the words-making it difficult to read. This edition offers an object lesson to always go with a large publisher, as they have the means and experience to create a book that is an accurate and well laid out version of the author's original intent. This book looks like it was printed by a ninth-grade student and I urge you not to buy it. I will be returning my copy for a refund."
4,Survival In Auschwitz by Primo Levi,IT IS A VERY GOOD BOOK FOR PEOPLE TO LEARN ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST AND THE CAMPS AND WHAT THE JEWISH PEOPLE WENT THROUGH IN THERE LIVES TO BE ABLE TO LIVE. I DO SAY THAT EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK FOR SURE.
4,Not bad for a white guy.....,"Maybe enough data was not submitted to whomever Amazon employs to provide thier informational blurbs for the albums they sell,but this two cd set is fronted by guitarist Lex Vandyke..He's no Muddy Waters,or Albert Collins,but he ain't bad for a white bluesman...32 sides,offering about two hours of material are contained on these two cds,ranging from very traditional items to a few that aren't really blues at all,but are instead pop tunes that have been given a sort of blues update...If you are expecting real gritty down-in-the-dirt blues then pass this item by,however,if you like your blues on the light side then this package is for you"
5,Wow! Don't need another book!,"When we went to London, we bought several other guide books. We should have saved our money. This book was outstanding! The book told us about all the sights everyone knows, and many many more that I would have never thought of. This book is the best. The map in the book is great. Don't buy another! This book sold us on the Time Out series. We will never buy another guide book. Neither should you!!"
4,A little guide with alot of information,I really like the look and how compact this book is for travel. You don't need another book. It's packed with information and you almost don't need to buy the Time Out London Mazagine if you plan ahead.
4,Better than the rest!,"I've purchased Frommer's, Eyewitness Guides, and Time Out. Time Out is absolutely the best guide I own. It really gives you thorough ideas of what to really DO in London, instead of just seeing the regular old touristy stuff. If you're going to London for a second or a third time, or you're going to be there for a long time, I highly recommend it.It's the only guide I pull out every time I travel to London."
2,Not very useful,I found this book to be lacking in really useful information.Better guides are available free from many travel agencies or on-line.Hotel info mostly coversmore expensive places and I found the maps to be particularly useless. Muchinformation on British history but little help to a novice tourist.
5,Wonderful Brakes!!!,The Hawk brake pads are excellent. I was impressed by the craftsmanship of the brake. The braking distance is so much greater than with the OEM brakes which these replaced. I will by these pads again.
3,A little disappointed,"I put these on my 2005 Honda Civic Coupe. Stopping distance was about the same, these will absolutely stop your tires- the only real problem I had is if I brake hard at high speeds my tire will skid, but that just goes to show how great of braking the pads are. They have definitely lasted longer and still appear to be going strong, I took it in and the mechanic said they look practically new, although I installed them 8 months ago.My biggest annoyance with these brakes is the screeching sound every time I brake, I've had it ever since they were installed. It basically sounds like 1,000 finger nails scraping across a chalkboard, however it doesn't affect braking distance or anything else. I still get some decent brake dust but not nearly as much as my other pads. However I still prefer the OEM pads to these because of the noise."
3,Not impressed,"The first time we tried this oil about 10 years ago, it was great. This time our experience is different and disappointing. The recipe must have changed or something as this fails to meet our expectations. It does have a great fragrance and is edible with a pleasant flavor. However, the oil seems to have lost its warming characteristics and gets sticky quite rapidly during an encounter. There is no production/mfg info to determine if its old stock. We will not be buying again."
1,Hated It!!!,"When my son got to heavy for me to comfortably carry him in his front carrier I started looking for a carrier that would allow me to wear him on my hip instead. I bought this carrier when he was 6 months old and about 18 lbs. The day I bought it I tried it out at the mall. After about 30 minutes we were both miserable. It had dug into my neck and into his armpit. We both had marks from the carrier. I took it back the same day! I ended up buying The Ultimate Baby Wrap and liked it much better. The soft fabric never dug in to either of us. I now us that and I also bought an adjustable sling, also only made of fabric and LOVE IT!!!"
4,white fang-a thriller,"go on an adventure whith a wolf named white fang.climb hills,travel miles,and have a great experience with white fang-a thriller that will keep you on the egde of your seat.you will not want to put this book down!"
4,COOL,I read it in 3rd and in 4th. It's a great book and I enjoyed it very much. It's kinda funny that White Fang goes from wild to domestic. He is a great wolf and I wish he was real. The book took me to the life of being a sled dog.I reccomend it to grades 4th and up
4,nice hat for $10,"nice fitted hat, $10 with prime shipping.Too bad amazon will start collecting Tax for NY, good deals are going to be hard to find"
2,"Great looking cap, but the sizing is off...","This is a great looking cap but unfortunately the sizing is off. Not sure if it shrunk while getting that ""washed"" look but it's a little on the small side."
3,Mets garment wash hat,This cap was correctly sized and 100% cotton. The illustration makes the product appear stiffer than it actually is. The cap isn't really stiff it's a fitted garment wash cap.
1,Basball cap,I bought a New York Met cap from this vendor and it arrived on time but the washed look made it to worn looking and the size I normally wear is Med to Large and this hat I ordered was a large but it was so tight it felt like a small. Wound up giving it to my nephew to wear and no but I wouldn't buy again.
4,Book Content and Errors,"This is an excellent reference for the practising engineer. However, some serious revision need to be done by the authors to correct the numerous spelling errors which make reading some parts of the book difficult."
2,An excellent book but LOADED with errors.,"An excellent book but LOADED with errors. I bought this handbook for the civil engineering licensure exam, but after some serious review, I don't think I'll use it. I found numerous equations and conversions that were obviously wrong. I like the book and appreciate the vast amount of material covered by it, but would not recommend it until subsequent revisions corrected the many mistakes."
5,Phoenix heat,"Let me start off by saying I LOVE this fan. On low it moves more air than any other box fan or stand fan that I have ever had. The tilt is great because you can put it on the floor and tilt it up to hit you in bed or put it on a table and tilt it down to hit you. On low it feels like the high setting on a normal stand fan, on medium it bliss and on high it's like your outside during a really windy storm. We live in Phoenix and just now going into our evil godawful hot summer season and I hate turning the AZ lower than 83, even than the air still kicks in ever 20 minutes or so. I'm hoping that with two of these fans it'll keep it a little cooler in the house so I can either turn the AC up to 85 or it won't kick in so often. Also I purchased these fans off of Walmart.com and saved $9 and only paid 97cent shipping. There is a version of this fan with a remote but I think having remotes for the tv and dvd player is bad enough."
4,Good fan,"The fan moves a lot of air and we dont need AC (in Pittsburgh summer) with this fan around. However, I was disappointed not to find any information on energy usage of this fan. Neither the amazon site, nor lasko site or the manual included lists how much wattage this fan takes."
1,"Bought two, both burnt out within a week of use.","For nearly 10 years I had owned a windmachine fan very similar to the 3300 model I am reviewing and while the original is still going strong(!) I decided I wanted another, in fact two more since they were so reliable (right?). Well, both of the new ones I had ordered burnt out within a week of use. Basically I would smell ozone and the fan would either be stopped or moving very slowly. Basically I wasted my money on these two new fans. I am just glad I still have the 10 year old one to keep me cool this summer."
3,"Cheap, has problems, but works","It's very cheaply made and has a very cheap look but indeed makes a good cup of coffee. I think I'm going to keep it for a while before being able to afford a better model. The biggest pain to me is the cleaning. Coffee continues to drip even you think you've waited long enough so if you don't have a cup in place all the time, it'll stain the pad for sure. Cleaning inside is extremely troublesome too. Permanent filter is not a problem to me. Just rinse and drop in dishwasher. It's started looking brown but it's ok."
1,coffe maker,"the coffe maker was good, but, the cup that came with it was broken. i don't have an more to write."
1,u get wat u pay for,"not good to use the filter is useless, coffee grinds drip into the water but its 10.00 so its up to u"
4,Pleased as punch,I love it. When I wake up at night I don't like to disturb the household. With my one-cup I can have a cup of hot tea or cocoa and no one else loses any sleep. It is quick and easy to use and cleans up readily. My only suggestion for improvement would be a slightly longer cord. In my room I had to use an extension cord.
4,Great for work,"This item I ordered it for at work, it works great the only thing I wish was a bit better was the filter. I am currently buying funnel shaped ones and cutting them to fit because the reusable one lets fine particles of coffee though. For the price it is very good."
2,Short Lifetime,This was a Christmas gift. Started using it late January. Worked as described. Made excellent cup of coffee. Stopped working first week of March. Two and a half months is way to short a time for this little machine to work. Very disappointed.
2,Get What You Pay For,"Basically a piece of plastic with a heating element - water never fully drips through, still needs paper filter to avoid ""coffee cup sludge,"" keeps dripping long after you turn it off. Still better than instant from the microwave, as well as wasting coffee from a larger pot."
3,Coffee is never hot enough..and it can be messy.,"The best thing about it is its size and it's white,not black and steel, which I do not like. It takes up very little space on the counter. I like that you don't need filters (but I plan to try using cut-down regular filters, napkins as suggested in other reviews.) My complaints: The coffee is not hot enough, so I have to put it in the micro-wave for a minute. Also,It is quite slow. My last complaint is the messiness. The brewing stops, but if you don't cut it off right away, after a few minutes a bit more coffee comes out and messes the counter and the cup stand. I have to check that all the water is out each time I make a cup because it usually isn't. Still,It is convenient and small and until I find a white or cream-colored TWO-cup maker that is not much bigger than this one, I will continue to use it. Over-all I would recommend it, especially if you don't like counter clutter. It's the only appliance I leave out all the time."
1,Avoid this one!,"This is very very very slow. It makes medium hot coffee, but it takes so long for the entire cup to brew the coffee is cool by the time you can start to drink it. I have had it about six weeks. Starting today, it will not pump and entire cup of water. I put a cup of water in the maker and turn it on and about 10 minutes later I have 1/2 cup of cool coffee. I have just ordered a new Black and Decker."
2,ralph hall,First cup was great. Second cup was bitter. coffee grinds got in cup. Filter doesn't work acceptably. Looking to find out what size disposable filer will fit. With a good filter this would be a great product.
4,No more wasted pots of coffee...,I don't have to waste any coffee now if I want to brew just one cup to enjoy when I'm home by myself. One star off because it is made out of el cheapo plastic and doesn't look too durable. But it fits my purposes just fine.
2,You get what you pay for.,"I really wasn't expecting much more, for the price. But after the first use, while washing, (by hand) the lid comes off,,sure it goes back on but it is not secure, and the little spout (where the coffee comes out) pops out and will not stay in. It all so takes at least 5 minutes to make a cup of coffee. I am sure I will end up selling this, at a future yard sale, or just giving it away."
5,Dreams of Australia,"This is a wonderful little book. It sweetly tells the story of one man's family, especially his mother and grandmother, and incorporates the locales and dreams and legends of the Great Southland, Australia. It is a very moving story which reads very true, although the author states that it is fiction. I am hoping that his obvious love for Australia continues and that he will write more about that great country."
1,huge loser,"what a rotten cd. if you enjoy really stupid, silly lyrics you'll love this cd; trouble is i expected something more serious like del amitri. don't know what justin currie was thinking but i think this cd is a ripoff and i would encourage you not to waste your money like i did. i rarely get rid of cd's, even bad ones, but this doen't have one decent song on it, so i'm donating it to my local library so i can at least claim a tax deduction for the sorry thing. p.s. do not believe the glowing review below mine which i assume must have been written by a friend or relative of currie's."
4,Es bueno!,"A mi en lo personal me ayudo mucho, aunque confieso que esperaba un poco mas de este libro. No puedes llegar a un autoanalisis completo con el, pero si te ayuda a encaminarte hacia este sendero."
3,I've got some swampland to sell.,"Their are 28 films in the ""Blondie"" film series (1938-50).This is the 23rd film.Blondie (Penny Singleton) made breakfast, but boys will be boys. Alvin (Danny Mummert) came over in his football uniform to tempt Alexander (Larry Simms) outside. Daisy tries to wake up Dagwood (Arthur Lake) on his day off. Some day off. Blondie wants him to varnish the floor and boy does Alvin have an idea.Dagwood's boss, Radcliffe (Jerome Cowan) drops by to have Dagwood buy some property for him in his own name as a proxy. So when Dagwood does as instructed and buys from Platt Realty, Dagwood sure does cause a swamp of a mess.Alvin decides he wants to build muscles to become stronger by buying a dumbell. The mailman replys, ""...and I have to deliver it. I knew their was a catch"".The next three films are:BLONDIE'S SECRET (1948)BLONDIE'S BIG DEAL (1948)BLONDIE HITS THE JACKPOT (1949)"
4,Does the job.,"This coiled phone cable is neither flimsy nor heavy duty. It's middle class I'd say, and it is working perfectly."
3,Might not work for your phone,"We bought this cord for a new phone that resembles the old style wall phones, but this length cord reduced the volume on the phone significantly even though the handset has a volume control. The wire is a lighter gauge than the normal old AT&T cords we have used in the past. Although we had no complaints from those we called about being heard, the level on our end was very weak. We replaced it with a 12 foot cord and the volume is very strong. I don't know if we got a bad cord or if the phone just can't handle a 25 foot cord."
4,"Good cord, but does not get full extension with desk phone","This product does exactly what I expected it to do. However, buyer beware, with a desk phone, after you extend a ""25 foot handset cord"" about 12 feet, it will pull today's light desk phone from its spot on your desk. If you buy a 12 foot handset cord, I expect the same result would occur after you pull it about 6 feet. Be guided accordingly in making your purchase."
5,phone cord,this telephone works great. it stretches 25 feet as it said it would. it connected easily to the phone and the price was good too.
1,Awful... Would never get it again!,"About a week into having the item... it stretched out, tangled and became just as bad as the one before... WOULD NEVER BUY AGAIN!"
1,Not recommended,"the cord looked worse than the one I replaced after just 1 week, so I bought the AT&T cord which works very well"
1,DID not work,This phone cord did not work. I could hear the other party on the line butthey could not hear me! To ship it back would cost more than just orderinganother.I ordered a GE from another seller. It works great.
5,Perfect,I'm not real sure how much you can say about a phone cord but I needed a long one in black and this one fits the bill. Very happy.
1,Not the Tampa Band,"Sad to say, this isn't the Tampa band I grew up with. Knew the guys. Was here when they recorded the albums, and they only had two before breaking up."
1,rockfan,"This joke of a band does not have the ""power"" of the original White Witch band who's music could be heard at any party I attended in the 70's. Those boys had talent.These imposters even do a bad cover of Alice Cooper's no more mister nice guy. Do not buy this joke of a CD instead grab the Original White Witch or A spiritual greeting. You will not be disappointed."
1,Pathetic,"I am constantly amazed that today's musical groups have such little imagination that they have to cop the names of yesteryear's bands who have already earned their niches in the music world's history.... and that they do it so very badly.Bands like the People, Touch, White Witch, Armageddon,(and the list goes on and on)were extraordinary one-of-a-kinds.And yet, modern bands continue to take those names for themseles, then release inferior, common, boring music, and expect no one to notice the difference while they attempt to suck in $$$ on the names of others.Pathetic!"
3,Usefulness varies on topic and purpose,"Contracts (9 hour lecture) completely worthless as to Multistate, focus almost entirely on California essay with no bullets as to multistate materialOn the other hand, Property, Crim Law, Crim Pro and Torts are essential for nuts and bolts of multi-state, by passing need to read outline and permitting you to go straight into practice questions with great success. Good purchase for those w/ limited reading time, allows effective study in MOST multi-state topics study while in commute, but will NOT suffice alone, and will NOT suffice for Contracts multi-state."
3,NOT SO MUCH FUN FOR 8 YR OLD,"I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A WONDERFUL TOY FOR MY GRANDSON BUT DIDN'T HOLD UP WELL, BAD GRAPHACS, ATE BATTRIES AT AN ALARMING RATE"
3,"Intentions are great, but old","This book reviews Open Office 1.x(OOo 1). This is great for those who work with that itteration. For the rest of us who cut our teeth on M$ Office, OOo 2 is much more M$ like. While many of the features and descriptions will translate from ver. 1 to ver.2, you are better off with the ""Sams Teach Yourself"" series which now cover version 2. Best bang for buck too, since it includes the program on disc. Program includes most features average user will ever need for a price that can't be beat."
4,enough for your needs?,"Horst demonstrates that the OpenOffice suite is easy to learn. You can quickly get started on any of its applications with minimal reading of a manual or text, like this one. The authors of OpenOffice spent considerable effort ensuring that a new user could rapidly do useful work.Of the applications, possibly the most heavily used is Writer. It does not have all the features of its Microsoft analog. But the basic operations of changing fonts, colours, etc, are present. If you have any previous experience with the Microsoft application, then Writer's abilities will be very familiar.Likewise for the other OpenOffice applications. None of these can match Microsoft's offerings for sheer quantity of features. But perhaps Horst shows that you can get enough for your needs."
4,StrongArm 4361 Lexus LX470 Hood Lift Support,"It took me hours to have it installed because I made some mistakes and kinda stupid in doing this sometimes, also the instructions are not clear to me.After the installation, I use the same way to close the hood by lifting the hood struts a little bit so that it would close by itself and this is the way of the original Lexus LX470 hood works. This won't work and I wasted time to remove one of the installations. Study and ask from the clublexus forum. Finally, get it to work by pulling it down to close the hood.So, it fits my 1998 Lexus LX470. The quality of the material is not as good as the OEM but the price is like 1/4 or 1/5."
2,Not the best recording quality,"I love Groucho but this particular recording is not up to the quality of the other DVD's of Groucho's shows. It's jumpy and jerky while playing, which is a great distraction."
5,my forbidden lover...,"nice cd... my favorites are fobidden lover with carl anderson as a duet, deeper, a quiet storm favorite, puttin my trust another one, and at the end a song for you, a remake from donny hathaway, she did a beautiful job, nancy's way..."
5,Forbidden Lover...Nancy Wilson,"This is Nancy at her very best. There are songs on this cd that are not included on any of her greatest hits cds. This is a must have for Nancy fans. She is accompanied by Carl Anderson, a great in his own right. You must hear I Was Telling Him About You, the lyrics are the bomb. Nancy with Carl is a dynamic duo. This cd is out of print. So sensous, so Nancy. I was elated to find it on eBay."
3,It is Not Contemporary Research,"I just bought this book and found that it should have been titled "". . . in Research up to c. 1993! It is a festschrift in honor of Metzger. I gave it 3 stars because I had to give it a rating to post this. I'm not sure what my final rating will be."
3,"Not the most comfortable, not machine washable",The medium cuts into me a bit too much for all-day wear and the large doesn't provide enough support. It's also not machine washable; my wife washes mine in the washing machine anyway and they're all fuzzy now. I'll be throwing them out when the rest of myJM Skinz Thongarrive.
2,Not 12 feet long or off-white in color as pictured.,"I was really excited to receive this in the mail yesterday. I recently got the OBI 100 to use with my Google Voice account (my most fulfilling purchase this year!) and a corded Panasonic to go with it, but the telephone cord on the phone wouldn't extend any more than 3 feet. I decided to give this telephone cord a try as 12 feet seemed more than sufficient for my purposes. However, I was disappointed upon opening the package and realizing that it wouldn't extend any more than 6 feet. Also, the color that's pictured is misleading: it has a distinctive yellow tinge to it, and is not off-white (or creamy), as pictured."
5,It just plain works well,"It's hard to get excited about a phone cord, but when your friends tell you it sounds scratchy on your phone, you've got no choice but to move or improve. Well, I improved and it worked instantly! With the no brainer RJ series connector, replacement was literally a snap. Now, I can keep my 30 year old phone running against all odds. Who knows? maybe it will see forty years. PS: This is a business phone and my third cord so it sees rigorous usage almost every day. No muss, no fuss, just good sound!"
1,"Belkin Pro Series telephone cord, ivory,12ft","This cord is ridiculously short and at best I would say it only stretches safely out about 5ft from the phone set. My previous cord may have been from AT & T or another well known phone mfr. and it stretched twice as far. If you are really in need of a long cord that stretches comfortably from the phone unit then DO NOT purchase this one or at least get one much longer than this one. The color was correct, however and the connections fit snugly."
2,phone cord,"This should have been a simple purchase of a replacement handset cord for the 'house' phone. Unfortunately, the cord is apparently defective because the handset is unusable with it. Not worth the effort to send it back."
3,Good inexpensive set.,"Pros: Inexpensive and easy to use. Two people can speak at the same time. Background noise level is better than another cheap system I have used.Cons: Not enough microphone ""reach"". With voulme knobs on receiver turned full up and amplifier volume up to where background noise is tollerable, you have to almost put your mouth on the microphone for it to be loud. Even moving the mic small distances away from your mouth drastically changes volume. Also not enough instructions or specifications. Not sure if receiver output is low impedance or high impedance but it did work with a low impedance amplifier input."
3,Worth The Money,"Caveat....really...really inexpensive for a 2-channel mic set-up. Sound is better than expected for the price. Set-up is straightforward and the only user settings needed are the level out dials. Fairly quiet (low noise/hiss) and good frequency response.....again, for the price. The fluorescent display has little info, but looks flashy while operating.The mics are somewhat cheap feeling in the hand, and the hard textured plastic can cause mic handling noise. Indoors, the range is 20-30 feet; less than the stated range, but fine for home karaoke, and with no interference. Order processing was fast and efficient....typical Amazon.The major limitation is low dynamic range, which causes distortion when singers belt out a particular range or hold it too close to their mouth, common with amateur vocalists. This is the primary reason I will be upgrading to a higher-end system."
5,pretty cool,"i have allergies to every kind of earring except surgical steel, which is hard to find, and gold, which is expensive. this ear cuff is a convenient way to wear jewelry in the ear. it's cute. and bends to fit your ear. more comfortable than many ear cuffs i've worn. cute, looks like the picture. sturdy enough to hold up."
4,black magic detergent,"i originally saw this product in lucky magazine and thought id give it a try. the bottle is small for the price, but my black clothes seem to be holding their color longer. it doesnt, however, restore black clothes that are already faded...fyi. i intend to keep purchasing it because i wear alot of black clothes."
1,Proposition 65,Did anybody here check out the California Proposition 65? apparently this product has ingredients that cause cancer....any comments?
1,Won't try--Participates in animal testing,I was looking forward to trying this product until I researched and discovered that Persil/Unilever still participates in animal testing. Caring for the environment means all of the environment not just the things we put in our mouths and into our water. V. uncool and much too out-of-fashion for this fashionable gal.
4,Love it but pricey,"I love this stuff, haven't used it long enough to know whether or not it preserves the ""blackness"" but, amazingly, it does seem to defintitely enhance black clothes that already have some fading from washing.Unfortunately, for a regular load of laundry your supposed to add well over 2 capfuls and the bottle is not that big. This stuff is a little on the pricey side and won't last long which means I'm not likely to buy it with any regularity.I would have given it 5 stars because I am impressed with what it really does but the price made me give it 4 or maybe even 3 stars."
5,Fantastic sweater wash,"Perwoll will save you buying new sweaters for a long long time.I thought it was just for black items, but after I ran out of my regular wool wash, I decided to use it on all my sweaters, including a white sweater.I have never had my sweaters come out not like new, but new.They smell delish.Nothing I've used can touch these results.Woolite was never an option. Complete junk."
2,smells nice,The fragrance was captivating but I am not sure it made a difference on my blacks. Not sure if it's worth the expense. I am using Woolite or shampoo for color treated hair.
4,Black Magic really works,"Black Magic has a fixing agent to set the color on black and dark color garments. It works better than I was expecting. I used to use Woolite For Darks on my dark colors. After buying a front loading Miele washer, I needed to change to HE type detergents. I don't know how it works, but my blacks actually look blacker after using Black Magic on them. (The actual product is a creamy white color.)Only two things keeps me from giving this product 5 stars. The fixing agent mentioned above makes your clothes come out smelling like hair dye. (An extra rinse cycle will remove most of the smell.)The other problem is that Black Magic contains enzymes to help it clean. That means it can't be used on wool, silk and other fibers that are damaged by enzymes. I'm very disappointed that I can't use this product on dark silk which always fades rapidly in the wash."
2,Boo... this book ain't that good.,"I really enjoy a good ghost story, which is why I gleefully bought this book (very cheap, thankfully). Long ago, when a mere teen, I read a book or two by Holzer, and can still remember having the feeling that it seemed contrived. So I can't say I wasn't prepared for it. Still, I'm disappointed. Holzer's accounts are quite simplistic and at times downright silly. If they are based on actual events, then they are written in such a way that makes their plausability so suspect, that it's impossible to take the book seriously. Therefore, it's mere fluff, simply a means of wasting a few hours if you've got nothing better to do. And if you're in no mood to get spooked."
5,If you are at all serious......,"....about Kepler, you must have this book. Period.By the way, Arthur Koestler's Sleepwalkers (and the Kepler chapterswhich were published under the title The Watershed) rely heavilyon Caspar's book."
4,Music for sabbath,This disc includes lively renditions of songs in English and Hebrew to celebrate the sabbath. It is similar in style to other recordings by this singer.
5,As real as can be!,"I grew up near Margaret and had always heard about her flying in races every where, but never gave it much thought. She was just a local lady who flew. I never suspected the stories she had to tell. I find that she is an inspiration to anyone who really wants to do something. Don't let any one stop you. The book reads really well and brings smiles, chuckles, and a few tears.Thanks Margaret for sharing you amazing life."
4,"Good, but there are no new songs","This is a great live cd featuring songs from their cd Spiritual Black Dimensions. All the songs are played very well, and I can bear witness that it captured all of Dimmu's live energy fairly well. But if you want a real good live album from Dimmu, track down the Spiritual Darkness: Alive In Europe bootleg. It's from just before they released SBD, and features a greater collection of songs, including the rare Inn I Evigehetens Morke."
2,Good Live Recordings... But a Rather Pointless Release,"The performances and sound quality on this live EP are actually very good. I have a few beefs though. For starters what exactly is the point of a live EP? The album clocks in at about 25 minutes. Why not just release a live album? Or at least include a new studio track as an incentive. Also why in God's name did they put ""Puritania"" on this? That is positively the worst track from ""Puritanical Euphoric Misanthopia"" and one of the worst (if not the worst) tracks they have ever done. Also, where is the guitar solo in ""The Insight and the Catharsis""? If Galder can't handle the solo's why not get a better guitarist. As such this album is for Dimmu fanatics only. Newcomers and moderate fans should buy ""Stormblast"" (original version), ""Enthrone Darkness Triumphant"", ""Spiritual Black Dimensions"" and ""Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia""."
4,Do you like comedy/horror movies?,"There are great comedy/horror/mystery movies out there- if you like the genre, you will enjoy this oneThis is the B&W; movie you used to see on Saturday morning or late at night when you were a kid. Strictly fun"
5,"great reception, easy to use, not to large","Love this phone - have a similiar fax machine with the same cordless phone and it gets hands down the best reception in the house - you can plug in a headset, but this desk phone set actually came with a shoulder piece that is really comfortable to. very easy to use and it's so nice to have the speakerphone available for when the phone is ringing and no one can find the cordless phone handset! highly recommend."
1,Cholestsure - did not work,"I bought the product based on a recommendation at a big vitamin store (Willner) in NY whose salespersonseemed to be very knowledgeable. I was looking forward to find a natural substitute to theStatins that I have been taking for years (40mg) and which kept my cholesterol level low.Let me note that I am watching my cholesterol diet as well as weight and I exercise almost every day.After one month of using Cholestsure instead of the Statin, my LDL went up from 81 to 191!!!!Nothing changed in my diet, stress level etc... only substituting one pill (statis) to 3 pillsa day of Cholestsure. A side note: The Cholestsure pill repeats and does not taste very good - whichI would not mind if it actually worked."
2,A Pilgrim's Progression,"The story is great. The production is not. The artistics were very weak, and it really distracted from the story itself."
5,Great music for the blues fanatic,"If you haven't heard this album you are in for a surprise. The Fab. Thunderbirds were at their best, music-wise and line-up-wise when they recorded this one. Listen to ""Wasted Tears"" on an evening when you are a little melancholy, and it will tear your heart out. Or how about ""How do you spell love?"" No truer words were ever recorded, listen carefully to them. Top them off with ""Sofa Circuit"". These guys were in their element on this album, it is too bad that they were to only record a few more and then personell changes weakened their impact. All told, this is an essential album for Kim Wilson and Jimmie Vaughn fans. The Duke Robilard era is okay, but this was the Thunderbirds at their best."
3,Do Your Research,"Yes, this makes good waffles; HOWEVER, I have subtracted two stars - one because it is hard to fill the shapes in the waffler and I seem to end up overfilling to get in the whole shape (animal's head, legs, etc). I guess if you use a very thin batter it might be easier to fill. The second star I subtracted was because this is VERY hard to clean. It doesn't come apart and it is hard to get in the crevices to get all the gunk off. It doesn't just wipe clean with a paper towel, as stated. I always make ""tester"" waffles the first time and throw them away, just makes me feel a little better, but sure a waste of good batter! I will be on the lookout for a waffle maker that is more ""user friendly""."
3,"Cute, but not efficient","This item was adorable and my daughter loved the idea, however, the iron's performace was weak. The shape turned out okay, but the top part of the iron doesn't cook the waffle completely no matter how many times you put the lid back down and the chirping sound it makes when it thinks the waffle is done gets annoying fast."
4,Makes good waffles!,"It's a good product, love that it chirps when it's done, easy clean up, easy to store, and tasty waffles! The only thing is - I've noticed the corners of the waffles are a bit less cooked then the centers - I believe it can be resolved by spreading the batter more evenly."
3,OK!!! if you dont forget to oil/buter the device first,"I was happy with everyones reviews so i bought it.Yes its easy to use and looks very stylish, BUT many times have i forgot to brush the insides with butter or spray oil first and even on setting 2 or 3 (goes up to 8 i think) they are BURNT!!! The waffles are a good size but i guess i just have to remember to grease. Also the back waffles are always darker than the front two??? I'm a bit dssapointed :-("
4,VillaWare V2001F UNO Farmyard Waffler,"Well, ya, we like it. But to be honest we don't actually use it ourselves. . .a good friend does who is a gourmet cook. That's how we got the waffler in the first place. . . she ordered the wrong model. My wife and I were unable to resist the idea of cute little animals appearing on our plate as waffles, so instead of returning it, we kept it. Now, implicit here is the notion that VillaWare irons are for experienced combat pilots. You need to know what you're doing when you make the batter and when you run the iron. So, if you understand waffle batter and you like little animal-shaped waffles on your plate, this might well be the machine for you. As regards the product itself: it's good and sturdy and looks like something that will last a long time."
4,i have the uno circus waffler,got it to make waffles for the grands. best waffler i've ever owned. only one that i've ever been able to make waffles with. subtracted 1 star because the unit does not come apart and can be a bit of a pain to clean.
5,Our favorite waffler!,"This is our favorite waffle maker! My kids absolutely love the fun shapes, and the fact that it ""chirps"" when the waffles are ready. Plus it makes four waffles at a time, which is a bonus when cooking for the whole family. Browns very nicely, and incredibly easy to clean. I've never even had to use non-stick spray.I've found it's best to use slightly thinner batter to make sure the shapes are evenly filled and come out looking like the animal intended."
4,Phase 10 in a tin,I was first introduced to this game while on holiday in America.It was then given to me as a Christmas present and the whole family has not stopped having fun with it.I have spread the Phase 10 word and there are now many houses around Ireland enjoying the game too!
5,Great game!,"I love Phase 10. This edition comes with a handy scorepad. It does take a little longer to play than other card games, but it's definitely a lot of fun. My husband and I play it alot together and also in slightly larger groups."
3,Phasing it Out...,"""Phase 10"" is little more than an Uno knockoff--even sharing some of the same ""special"" cards: ""Skip"" and ""Wild"". Then, there are the so-called ""phases"", which can ultimately be frustrating for both young players, and new players. Example:Phase 3 is a set of 4 cards (4 of the same number) and a run of 4 cards (a straight). You may have the following cards: (g=green, r=red, b=blue, o=orange) 2g, 3r, 4r, 6o, 6g, 9b, 11b, 11r, 12b, wild. Ultimaely, the player before you draws a ""wild"" card, and completes their phase. You, however get stuck with 85 points.With all the flaws, the game can still be competitive and fun. If you want something educational though, buy a Leappad."
5,Wonderful gift,"This was purchased as a gift for my 89 year old Aunt. She and two of her friends play Phase 10 three or four times a week and the old cards they were using were getting hard to shuffle. They looked in the stores in Texas but did not find any on the shelf. When I saw these on Amazon, I ordered them sent to her. She was so excited with the tin box but most pleased with the card tray. This helps keep the cards in the proper stack. At Christmas I plan to send another box to one of her friends so they do not need to carry the cards from one house to the other to play."
4,Good card game,I bought this thinking it was different from the originl Phase 10 but it was just in a nicer box. We really like the game so it wasn't a disappoint.
2,Tying to make the boring into the palatable,"What to do if you're trying to make something as stupid and boring as the bible into something that a poor gullible child will accept? This is the problem faced by the authors, and they do a half-way decent job of presenting bible idiocy as something partly entertaining as a comic book. Should be useful for gullible, brainwashed parents attempting to produce gullible, brainwashed children. Start them with Santa, and if they believe that, move on to the bible in comic book form."
4,The Magic Box,"I really like how this book explains various artistic techniques and children's development in the begining. In the back, all of the holidays and festivals are explained as well as a map of Israel and symbols for the various cities and tribes in Israel. The projects are farily simple, but if planned in advance could be made more difficult for the older age groups."
2,Missed opportunity,"Please be advised that the layout of this book is riddled with jumbled double print in varying type sizes overlaid over other print, making it impossible to read. I suppose that this was done in a failed attempt at being ""arty"". Make sure that you peruse a copy prior to buying it and then decide if you want to spend the money on a book with illegible text. In fairness, there are some interesting representations of surfing and art, presented chronologically. It's just a shame that the material wasn't presented in a format worthy of the subject."
1,pretender,i surfed with david carson a couple of timesfor all his talk the guy is a total fraud!he sat on the shoulder and didnt catch anything for hours
5,"solid, catholic theology with profound and personnal experience","Cardinal Journet is a giant in theology and his work about 'the meaning of grace', a translation of 'entretiens sur la grace' from the French language is one of his biggest achievements. Why so? his other books are often quite longer (eglise du Verbe Incarne)but isn't the question of nature and grace the most important one in catholic doctrine? Which part is God's and which part is Man's in a human act? How can people of other religions belong invisibly to the Holy Church and be saved by Christ the Universal Saviour? Difficult questions but clear answers. Thank you, Cardinal, and requiesce in pace."
3,Fun for a few minutes,"Good quality, limited excitement. I bought this toy for my 16 month old son. He likes playing wiht the animals and calling out their names and putting them in their respective houses for a few minutes but quickly gets bored. I was hoping he would like opening & shutting teh doors b/c hes very into opening & shutting but he wasnt with this toy-perhaops b/c its plush. The toy is very cute and very durable - I'm hoping he'll get more into the counting and sorting as he gets older."
3,small,"I was shocked at how small the pieces are. I bought this toy for my 1year old son for christmas and so far he has no interest in it. I am hoping that he will play with it when he gets older. On the plus side, it is very cute and great quality. I enjoy playing with it!"
3,So - So,I bought this for my son when he was around 2 years old and he never really showed much interest although I thought these farm animals are adorable. I kept this toy for my daughter who turns 2 next week and she's done with this toy. I just went on amazon to check the age range and I agree with another reviewer that it should start at 18 months. My daughter played with this toy from about 16 - 20 months and that's that ... and not for very long either.... I guess I'll keep it for a little while longer but it's just taking up space. Too bad. These animals are so cute.
2,Not what I expected,"The beans I received were dry, split and only a little fragrant.I had not bought any for a while, so I bought some others to compare and these are definitely inferior."
5,Great taste fresh,Really like these beans - I get lots of compliments on what I have made with them. Will order again.
1,FREDDIE HUBBARD'S WORST ALBUM!,"I don't know what the recommendations are about since this is clearly Freddie Hubbard's weakest album. His playing is sloppy and the arrangements are run-of-the-mill jazz fusion songs with no soul or feeling: It sounds like this boring mish-mash was quickly put together in just one take haphazardly. If you want to hear his best album, which really puts this garbage to tremendous shame, then listen to his 1961 album ""Ready For Freddie."" Otherwise, don't waste your money on this trash."
5,Mellllow,"This is jazz at its best. I remember first hearing his music on the famed radio station WHUR, early in the 1970's. One ""listen"" was all it took to hook me.I remember walking into the One Step Down Lounge in DC, plunking some coins in the jukebox, and traveling throught the smoky haze of the bar and into the convoluted nuances of Hubbard's fine fine rythms. (Since OSD also had the volume turned up on their jukebox, most of the bar patrons almost jumped off their stools at the first few notes of Red Clay - LOL)Hubbard's beautiful trumpet riffs were dark highways leading to a never-ending horizon at dawn, or a dark alley filled with secrets that whispered way up, beyond any confining walls, up into the mysterious constellations and late into the pre-dawn hours.The heartbeat pulse of his rythm and the exceptional fluidity of tone, volume and syncopation lent a timeless, eternal richness to his work.Freddie Hubbard, RIP -- I know there's a combo waiting Up there just for you."
3,not so special edition,"I'm rating this lower only because of the horrible packaging. The label should be charging about half the price for this CD. It comes in a cheap cardboard sleeve with zero extras; no booklet, liner notes, or essay, just a basic track listing with musician credits. This is the 40th Anniversary Edition? There is nothing special about this package at all! But this music found within is very, very pleaing. For the tunes alone, I'd rate it 4 stars, maybe higher. The classic title track and the jammin' ""Cold Turkey"" are my favorite cuts on here. I like the Blue Note period of Hubbard, but this jazz-funk fusion sound was mighty fine too. If you can pick this up at a cheaper price, go for it, or find an older version on disc, not this lame reissue."
3,Only one man's opinion,"A very thorough and well researched book, but a bit ""heavy"" for my tastes. I think the message could hve been delivered quite well in a lot fewer pages. It strikes me as a history book for historians, rather than a general interest book for the ordinary reader. Having said that, it infuriates me to see how incompetent the political and military leadership of the United States was to have let the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor be the surprise that it was. If the information in this book is accurate, and I have no reason to doubt that it is, Roosevelt, Hull, King and Marshall had to know that war with Japan was imminent by the last week of November, 1941. Given that, it is absolutely criminal that they let so much of our Naval force sit like ducks in a shooting gallery on December 7th. What could they have been thinking? Then, they turn around and ""hang"" Kimmel for incompetence to deflect criticism from themselves."
3,AN OPPORTUNITY MISSED,A WELL RESEARCHED BUT CLUMSILY WRITTEN WORK THAT WAS DIFFICULT AT TIMES TO FOLLOW. I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED MORE BIOGRAPHICAL MATERIAL ON ALL THE PARTICIPANTS. THE ENDING LEFT A GREAT DEAL TO BE DESIRED AS IT DID NOT COVER THE LAST FEW DAYS OF THE DIPLOMATIC EXCHANGES BETWEEN THE US AND JAPAN BEFORE THE ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR.
4,Thoroughly enjoyed this book,"Heinrichs successfully zeroed in on the months before World War II, actions, interactions, and results of decisions without being drawn into overpowering side stories, which is usually the downfall of such books. I strongly suggest this work to students of the period as well as those of us who just want to know more. WW II is not a focus of my reading habits, the subject just looked interesting to me, but I thoroughly enjoyed this experience. I went through the 284 pages quickly and at the end felt like I had learned quite a bit and wanted to read more by this author."
5,Lots of fun!!!,My kids love the puppet Capo and sing along while I learn how to play the guitar. I have tried different methods and this is the first that works. Very easily explained. Awesome work. Thanks.
4,"Part II In the Saga of ""Judas Priest Live"".","There are 2 Judas Priest live albums (we shall NOT acknowledge ""Metal Meltdown '98"" or whatever the hell its called, that is not true Priest), and this isn't the better of the two, but it certainly isn't horrid. ""Priest...Live!"" covers everything that ""Unleashed in the East"" couldn't: the 80's Priest, including the nauseating ""Turbo Lover"". Really when it comes to reviewing this record, it depends which Priest you prefer, the 70's Priest, a young band which fused blues, metal, and deep, penatrative lyrics with its music, or the 80's Priest, a ""great sometimes, horrible sometimes"" leather metal band which occasionally strayed so far into ridiculousness that it isn't funny. Which school of thought do you come from? Here's the way to tell: Have you ever heard a song by Priest called ""Deciever""? No? Ok, then you probably like 80's Priest. Get this record, then."
2,Good but unfortunately below Priest standards,"THis CD has only merit: contains the classic line-up of Halford /; Tipton / Downing / Hill / Holland, who recorded the great albuns "" British Steel "", ""Poinf of Entry"" and "" Screaming for vengeance"". But this same line-up recorded the infamous "" Turbo""... THe trobule with this live CD is that it has the TURBO "" soul"": cold, flat, heartless. COmparing it with with ""Unlleashed in the East"" is impossible."
4,"Not as good as being there, but...","In '87 I was trying to get out of high school (finally!), & this was definitely getting 5 stars from me cuz it was like, all the best from British Steel to Turbo. It was about time to hear all the classics live, you know? Like what more could you want?Now I wish I could hear more of a real set list including some of the earlier material. Maybe the band would be kind enough to dig into the vaults & put out a prime show from like, '83? But anyways I still say 4 stars cuz all the material rocks today as much as it did back then (including the five(!) songs off of Turbo). Definitely required for fans but not an all time great.Some have commented about the flat sound. I think I agree when played @ lower volume levels. But it shreds when you crank it. This goes for a lot of JP albums, actually. Just remember, this music is meant to be listened at TOTAL MAXIMUM ROAR!"
2,Stick With Unleashed In The East,"This dull, flat as a pancake sounding live outing should be avoided out of respect for what Priest once was. All you get here is their later years commercial shout alongs including one too many cuts from the godawful Turbo release. False metal by my standards any day."
4,"No frills, but does the job","No issues with this splitter. When two devices are plugged into it, the volume will be decreased, as should be expected.Volume controls would have been nice, but they are not advertised, so should not be expected."
2,Poor performance,"I bought this splitter because my new computer monitor didn't have a jack for headphones. I plugged the splitter in the speaker jack on the back of the monitor and then plugged the speaker wire into one side of the splitter and my headphones into the other side. It worked well for a couple days, but the headphone plug-in is now so loose in the splitter that the sound comes through the headphones and the computer speakers at the same time which makes the splitter useless to me."
1,Cheat Product,"The item I got is different from the image. And the quality of the product is poor. There is no Belkin label on the cable, it looks like the product I got is fake."
3,Not so good but ok for the price,Since the day one the product it is not working well. I need to keep on adjusting one connector to listen to the sound. I bought this especially to watch movies by me and my wife so that my son wont get disturbed when he is sleeping.My both of the headphones are from Sony & Apple and they work superb when Iuse them independently.Overall i could say i am not much satisfied with this product.
1,Beware: Item pictured is not what is shipped!!,"Before you order this item be aware that the picture shown here in the product description is not the actual item shipped. Although it accomplishes the same result, it is a totally different product. If you want the item shown, and are willing to accept a black version, then consider ordering the Belkin Y adaptor from Amazon instead:Belkin F8Z359tt06INCHP Y Adapter; Mini Stereo Plug. That's what I did. This item can be found on the Belkin website and what is pictured there is what is pictured here on the Amazon site. So, bottom line, what is shown is what should ship. I returned the original item to Amazon because it is definitely not what I wanted."
3,Does not work with iPad cases,"I bought these hoping they'd work with my classroom iPads, but the jack is too large for the Trident AMS iPad 2 case opening. I also tried them with the iPad Kraken case, and they didn't fit on that one, either. I sincerely wish either the makers of the cases would make their opening larger and/or Belkin and other audio cable companies would make their jacks smaller."
1,Didn't Work & No Response,"I bought this splitter so that my wife and I could both listen to an audiobook while at the beach. One side did not work. I contacted the vendor, iFlash, Inc., but got no response. I didn't bother shipping the defective $2.39 splitter back to them, but simply spent more money to buy one that works. It is interesting that the accompanying order sheet asked me to post a positive review! No usable product plus no service equals no positive review, iFlash."
5,Great splitter for the price.,"What I really like about this splitter is that it is nickle plated, which enhances conductivity and is it rare to find on audio equipment bought these days."
1,Volume control,yes it does what it says.. you can use two head phone at once but you cant hear the sound thats different story...
5,Belkin Speaker and Headphone Splitter,"I like how flexible the splitter is. Easy maneuvering,easy plugging in. I do like the color, the splitter works well on my smartphone and my computer.I am happy with the purchase.Thank you"
1,Doesn't work every time. Don't even use it!,It cost $2 for a reason. I don't even use this product anymore because it is not reliable. I do not recommend this product if you plan on actually using it.
5,Works Perfect,"Not much else to say, it splits audio as intended and is incredibly cheap for what you're getting. Would recommend"
5,Simple Enough,"Bought this for long trips on an airplane so that two people could sit and watch one monitor, works great."
2,Needs figiting,"Cheap product that works sometimes, often requires a little fudging with the cords to get the sound through. Great for occasional use but not reliable"
4,Straightforward and functional,"This product does exactly what I wanted it to. I honestly don't have anything bad to say about it. If you want to plug in multiple headphones to one jack, this is the way to do it. My girlfriend and I can listen to the same music when we study in coffee shops now, which is wonderful. I recommend it."
2,Loss of Sound Quality and Intermittent Connection,I ordered three sets. I have only tested one but on that one the sound quality is brassy and tinny compared to my earphones and one of the female connectors has a bad connection and is intermittent.
1,Total Crap,"First off, the item I received is Belkin but looks nothing like this photo.Secondly, I purchased them for use on a trip that didn't happen, so, this stayed in my drawer, in the unopened pkg. for several months. Have another trip coming up, found the pkg., opened it up and tried the splitter...DOESN'T WORK! Sounds like your listening through a tin can! TERRIBLE SOUND QUALITY."
5,great,splits sound so you can send it to 2 sources. doesn't separate left from right which is great. make sure to buy an extender.
1,Not as described,"I recieved the headphone splitter and it was not as described. It did not split the signal into two stereo outputs, instead it split the stereo into separate right and left outputs. If two people want to listen then each set of headphones will only get one side of the stereo signal. On a positive note, the seller quickly refunded my order and I didn't even have to send the product back."
1,misleading information,I bought this product assuming that the positive reviews would be correct and that the negative reviews were people who were mis-shipped the wrong item. I received a cord in the mail that looks identical to the one pictured and it does exactly what the negative reviews say it does. it doesn't split one audio source into two. it takes a 2 channel audio source and splits it into right and left channels. If you really need an extra connection and spot to lose audio quality to split your output into left and right channels for your receiver this will work wonders for you. if you are just trying to split an audio source into two duplicate connections steer clear of this as you will only wind up wasting your money.
1,Misleading,I ordered this thinking that i would get a splitter so that i could use two headphones for one jack. All the product did was split the audio into a left and right channel. I could only hear the left side of my headphone that was connected to the white side and vice versa.
1,Incorrectly labled and sold - does NOT split a stereo signal to stereo headphones,"The item is unusable as a splitter with 2 sets of stereo headphones - the white jack connects to left channel (tip) only and the red jack connects to right channel (ring) only. Yet a careful look at the jacks provided shows they are stereo jacks.Frankly, I'm not sure what the application is intended to be...I'm unable to come up with any use for it, unless you're a couple who happen to be hearing-impaired in opposite ears."
2,Was this transaction a bait and switch?,"Well, at first this seemed like a deal, but when the package arrived, they sent a no name, generic brand piece of crap, that wasn't even close to the specs of the belkin, it was corroded and looked like some Chinese made reject that was originally partially submerged in a floating ocean going storage container, well to say the least I flipped out! I contacted the seller and they said it was a mistake, that someone must have grabbed the wrong item ( because they sell both) and then sent me the Belkin, which I have to say is real nice stuff, that came sealed and works great... SO, my question is... Are they doing this to anyone else, and moreover, why in the hell are they even stocking the non working garbage they sent to me in the first place???? So, if you buy from this place, make sure it arrives in a sealed package that says BELKIN!!! Otherwise, get ready to be pissed off!"
2,Inconsistent after a few months,"Worked perfectly for the first week after I bought it. Then I put it in a drawer for 4 months until I needed it again. The next time I went to use it, I found that the sound would cut out unless regularly to wiggled my headphone cord in the jack. Can't recommend it for longevity."
3,Works fine but too thick for iphone bumper,"This splitter works fine, but be aware it won't fit if you ned a 'slim' plug to fit in your iphone case or recessed jack."
4,"Good splitter, but I purchased the wrong one :)","Splitter is great, but I meant to purchase a splitter that went in the other direction... (i.e. two male 1/8"" audio to one female 1/8"" audio)Oh well. This is great at what it does."
4,Belkin head phone splitter,There great came new in box. They work great. I use them to watch movies and on a long trip with family or friends.
2,Poor Quality,"First of all, I'd like to start by saying that this product does in fact work, however, it does not work well.When connecting earbuds or headphones to this splitter, you have to ""wiggle"" it a quite a bit until it gets in the correct orientation. The sound quality will be poor if you have it rotated the wrong way.I expect devices like this to be plug and play, I do not want to sit there and play with it for a minute before I can use it."
5,Works perfectly,"Works perfectly, splitting the sound between two audio cables. I have had not problems with it and is great for the price."
3,"Works, but not perfect.","The adapter works, but not perfect. Everything plugs in tight and there is a signal but the connection is not 100%. The main line works well, but the splitter plugs for the headphones have a crappy connection. Once plugged in the headphone plugs would have to be rotated within the connector to achieve a good sound signal. Otherwise the sound is not clear and somewhat tuned down. When you find the perfect position the signal is good. Works and cheap, but I expected better!I used in for a laptop watching a movie on a plane. Would have been happier if the connection worked well.The packaging does say Belkin, but sometimes I question these cheap products which are in many cases counterfeit fakes."
1,Not worth a darn,"When I'm using this splitter, the audio only comes out of one side. Going to see if i can have it replaced for free."
5,Works great.,Read some other reviews that it split the audio from left to right but that was not my experience. It worked perfect for my trip so that my friend and I could listen to the same MP3 or Ipod. We used both and it worked great on both. Noise level was great. Highly recommend.
1,Doesn't work,Dead On Arrival. One of the two female ports doesn't work at all. Tried with multiple sets of headphones. Will continue searching for other products...
5,Great for airplane movie sharing,"I bought these for watching movies with my hubby on the airplane and they are great, simple to use, cheap and best of all, we could both hear and see the movie at the same time-I've also used these in stadiums while tuning in to the local sports channel...very good little gadget"
5,"good product, good price","my son needed it for his phone - says it works fine, just as expected. very reasonable price, good product"
2,bad,"the audio works, but if u turn the 3.5 mm jack, the sound cuts off. kinda annoying. i ordered from Bastexwireless. very timely for shipping, but beware"
1,"NOT Belkin, cheap knockoff made wrong!","This is not a genuine Belkin item, or at least it wasn't from the seller I purchased from.Here's what it does: it takes a stereo signal, dumps the right channel, replaces it with a copy of the left channel. AND ITS LIKE THAT ON BOTH OUTPUT JACKS!There's nothing weird about the shape or size, and it all plugs in completely, but totally screws up the audio channels.The NSI splitter I ordered from a different seller was very similar to this one, because it switched left/right channels. It was an obvious fake item too, not like their standard stuff.I'm getting real tired of all these bootleg, knockoff, cheap imitation, counterfeit cables! They're all being assembled in the dark!"
1,very low quality,"when you plug in both, speakers and headphone, the speakers` laudness automaticly going down ! NOT RECOMMENDED ! Very low quality !"
3,3.5mm splitter,"I gave this splitter 3 stars because even though it works ok there is a lot of static in one of the output lines. It's difficult to hear anything when using it for music etc. Overall it's build quality is good, it doesn't really feel cheap. I probably wouldn't buy another one in the future unless I really needed one."
4,does what its supposed to,it splits a headphone jackso if you need to split a headphone jack-buy this.pretty practical. is what it is
5,Cool,"This item was shipped promptly, looks just like in the pic and works perfectly plus cheaper than in stores. Thanks!"
3,Gets the job done,"This device does what it says it will do. I returned home to find it irreparably damaged, but discovered it was my older brother's mistake. Easily replaced for just a dollar or two."
5,Audio Splitter,"A very good item to have. I have a couple sitting around at all times for several uses. Whether it's for speakers, earphones, or just patching sounds to a recorder!"
5,Does exactly what it should,"Pretty straight forward. It splits 3.5mm jack two ways. M-FF connection. Pretty cheap, I'd buy them again if I had to."
3,"Not what I was looking for, but...","I was looking for an adapter that split the stereo signal into two separate monaural signals. I've since learned that the description for what I want usually refers to ""tip and ring"" outputs"" - those types of splitters are hard to find.The description led me to believe it was what I wanted, but I should have read it more carefully. As a stereo splitter for attaching two headphones I suppose it would be fine."
1,JUNK!,I hate the fact i even had to give this a one star it doesnt work all this product is is junk please dont buy it your wasting your money it is JUNK!!!
1,Cheap and Awful,"I bought this product to use with my Astro MixAmp, my Xbox 360, and a pair of Beyerdynamic MMX300's for gaming. They are awful. The audio quality and volume are greatly diminished and there is NO SURROUND SOUND. It is worse than listening to a pair of Beats at full volume from 10 feet away. (Beats are just bad, please don't say different. They just look cool)Do not buy this product. It is overpriced for what it is."
1,Head phones work fine but microphone doesn't work,"The splitter works fine for the head-phones but couldn't get the microphone to work. It seems to be some contact issue with the splitter and the socket on my laptop. If I pull it out a tiny bit and hold it, I can get it to work faintly. Otherwise, there's no microphone function. I wish I had a solution for this. This one turned out to be useless."
1,DOES NOT PRESERVE STEREO SEPARATION!!!!,"This device sums both channels and creates a mono version of whatever you are listening to, sending this new mono version to the two pairs of headphones. Stereo separation is LOST. If that doesn't bother you, buy it. To me, it is essentially worthless due to this limitation."
3,Good but not great,"I finally tried it when my cousin and I wanted to hear the game I was playing when everyone else were talking loud. Although, there were some loss audio in terms of volume but I think it can be tweaked to have both in its own individualized sound. Also, we used it on the computer and that's because I play my PS3 on an 720p HD monitor connected to my eMachines computer. I bought an Amazon Basics HDMI to DVI cable to make it happen. Anywho, sound can be diverted in so many ways when it's connected to a computer, I didn't have time to figure out how to have us our own sound volume and preventing the loss in sound volume. All in all, this is a great cheap device and if anyone is looking for a good headphone splitter, you should get this."
1,"Awful product, hardly works","This is truly an awful product. It was delivered as pictured and on time, yet it does not work properly. It's almost as if I have to hit a sweet spot when I plug it in for it to operate. This is a horrible product. I would return it if the return shipping wouldn't cost so much. I guess that in this case you get what you pay for."
4,It works fine,"Nothing fancy, but it get the job done! It works just fine. I would recommend this product. Not to mention it is very cheap!"
1,Cheap JUNK,These people show an item thats not even close to what they send. TOTAL RIP OFF. Buyers beware. Don't be fooled by cheap prices.
1,Bad Connection,tried to use this splitter with a Macbook pro - it failed to connect to the port properly. I do not recommend this product for that reason.
3,Okay but...,"I've only used these a few times after having them for a while. I've noticed when plugging in two pairs the sound quality changes and isn't as clear as it is without the splitter. They were inexpensive and do their job so I can overlook that aspect. If you really want a better sound quality from a splitter I would consider looking for another product. If you don't mind that then, for the price, this product will do well."
1,defected,"not packaged ,open product or not Belkin, kills the volume control! don't waste your money on this product.not new as stated..."
3,only splits w non-microphone ear buds,Does not work with ear buds / headphones w built-in microphones. May be OK with plain simple buds / headphones.
5,Works great,"Works great, saved the day - just make sure you or your friend has a volume control on the headphones, my husband listened to movies at a higher volume then i did, but he could adjust it on his head phones so it all worked out. But they make the keychain splitters now, so i'd be interested in trying one of those, that way its less 'cords'"
4,Nice and Simple,"It does the job. I tried this on MacBook, iPhone4, ipod 4 and on a Dell PC. It works fine except that there is a drop in volume."
3,Does the job..,I bought this cable for a recent trip so my wife and I could both listen to movies through our headphones on our Galaxy Tab. We initially had some trouble getting the cable to work properly. At first my wife would hear music while I would hear the voices. After playing with the cable for a little bit it ended up working and we were really grateful that we bought it.
3,buy it if you don't see a thicker one;,"The price should maybe be lower because the wires seem just average. Some days i have to wiggle the jack for a second to get one side to work. But it is not that annoying and it might be the computer jack's fault, in which case i would say 4 stars not 3. I'ld buy it again just cause i did not see a better made one in the short time i looked on amazon."
1,"Very, very disappointed with these.","I bought this to unify my PS3 and computer sound cables into one to my sound system, so as to not have to change from one input to the other each time. Well than god it's dirt cheap cos this product is terrible. The sound quality degraded a lot and even the volume did weird things: with both inputs plugged in, the volume went down like by half, and just disconnecting one of them restored things to normal. Weird.If you're looking for good quality sound, stay away from this crap."
1,Less than one star!,"This item did not work right from the stzrt. I ended up buying another one from Radio Shack instead, and no problems (fromt that one)."
4,Good Product,I bought this for my iPad so I can listen to music or watch movies and shows with my wife without having to share one earphone. It works great. The only issue I have with this is that the sound quality decreases just a bit and sometimes I have to plug in my earphones a certain way for it to start working. But it gets the job done so I'm satisfied.
3,Has its problems,"Works, but the female ports are quite stubborn. Those who are experiencing problems getting stereo audio are probably not pushing in their connectors all the way into the ports. Once they are in completely, stereo should be working. It's still problematic though, as it is also difficult to pull the connector out of the ports once they've been pushed all the way in, so this would not be an ideal splitter for headphones as there's a possibility that you just might pull the jacket around the connector for your headphones off or even damage the connector permanently. If you don't plan on inserting and removing connections to this splitter frequently though, it should be sufficient for your needs. Just know that you're not paying for the best here."
1,Useless,Timely shipping but the product is useless. The female ends are too small and sometimes the audio is inaudible in one of the channels. $3 down the drain.
4,Does what it needs to do.,The product does what it needs to do and it works well at it. I would recomend for people with girlfriends who don't like sharing earphones while listening to music together.
2,not worth it,Has a buzzing noise and one of the lines doesn't makes the right speaker not work. Was hoping these would help split the speakers for my tv and pc.
4,"Cheap and cheerful, but caution the volume drop","As other reviewers have noted (and I've taken this into account for purchasing), the volume drops across both outputs since the signal is split -- not a big concern for me, but on some setups this may result in an unhappy amount of line noise when you have to crank source volumes to compensate.I use this because I have a stereo deck (with high-quality Sony MDR-V900s attached) and a Plantronics headset I use for recording video tutorials and such on my computer. I didn't want to actively have to toggle back-and-forth, since that'd impede my workflow: my use case is swapping between headsets quickly, and this Belkin splitter is a tidy little solution!"
5,Great,"Exactly what you are looking for, dont hesitate or spend more money than you have to for a simple splitter"
2,Sound is spotty,Connection is touchy. Have to twist the plug in order to hear both ear pods sounds. I would've expected better from Belkin.
1,"sprout and then, soon after, die","pretty much all of the seeds I planted sprouted and then died. They just don't seem to be very stock. I would not recommend, and next time I will try another brand."
4,Seems like a good buy,"Seems like a good buy. Haven't planted yet. If they grow, they are great! They were delivered quickly and packed nicely. I cant wait to get them in the garden."
1,No good,Followed the directions. You must soak these over night as per the directions. I didn't get one plant to grow. I used the Jiffy 5032 Professional Greenhouse 25-Plant Starter kitBig waste of $. Lesson learned.
4,Makes a nice Gift,"I just got my order today via Amazon Prime, right on time. Package was neat and informative, a ziploc bag with two helpful booklets, the 12 seed packets (most containing what appear to be 100 seeds), and a personal note from the seller who owns the operation. Very colorful, has all the right information, not too complex. VERY good value for the money.This would make a nice gift to a budding gardner (pun intended), especially since it contains instructions about starting from seed which are hard to find on the internet."
3,Ok,"Some grew, some didn't. Not sure if the seeds were too old or what.. May try again if I can't find the seeds any place else."
4,Good Quality Herbs,The seeds arrived well packaged and in a timely manner. Mine did not come in little plastic pouches (as pictured). They arrived in what looked sort of like pill boxes with the name of the seed in each section printed on the tab. The pill boxes were shrink wrapped and delivered in a padded envelope. I planted them a few days after they arrived and at this time most of them have already started to sprout and grow. The only reason I did not give 5 stars was because they did not arrive with any planting instructions so I'm not sure if the ones that haven't sprouted yet needed something done to them prior to planting or if they are just slow to sprout.
5,Herb seeds,"The seeds were packaged very well and they had detailed instructions on how to plant them. Very nice product and prompt delivery. I would highly recommend these seeds, they are already sprouting."
1,Seeds were old.,Seeds were old. It took forever for them to germinate. Some seeds didn't germinatre at all. You'd be better off buying seeds at local stores.
3,"Not sure, because it was a gift",I gave as a gift and am not sure of their satisfaction at this point
1,Very disappointed,"I will never order from this company again. The amount they charged for shipping such a small package was outrageous. When I placed this order, I also placed 2 other orders, book orders, with other vendors; their shipping rate was much cheaper and I received both book shipments the day after my herb seeds arrived. You pay this huge shipping cost to be sent FedEx yet I received my book order via postal service at a much better rate and almost as timely manner. Plus I placed my ordered because of the reviews, others wrote stating that their seeds arrived in small pill type containers, my ordered arrived in plain white seed packets. I was giving this as a gift and very disappointment. I would have been better off if I had gone to a local nursery and purchased seed packets. Again, I will never use this company again, a huge rip off!!!!"
3,Caution needed,"Haven't received the herb packets yet, so just put in a preliminary 3-star rating. But noted several people saying they were happy with the free pack of California poppy. The latest issue of Horticulture has this in the list of invasive under certain conditions, it will out-compete native plants in a natural area. So please be careful. For more info: [...]"
3,It's only seeds.,"Purchased for my daughter. Gives many different seeds. You need lots of room to plant twelve herbs. Not sure if the seeds grow yet, she hasn't planted any yet."
3,"Good, organic seeds",They come in cute little hard plastic boxes (kinda like pill boxes) for easy and dry storage.
5,"A nice assortment of herbs,",This is a very nice assortment of cooking herbs. I am looking forward to planting my kitchen garden this spring.
5,Good product,More than what I expected. Comes with great tips for growing and uses.Some herbs are not readily available in stores. This is perfect for someone who wants a variety of herbs at there fingertips.
1,Dated and cheap,"Some of the rhythms are not bad on this album, but the production techniques and the quality (or rather, lack of quality) of the songs themselves are embarrasingly bad. ""1-2-3"" is a prime example. It sounds like it was written in about 2 minutes, if that. No amount of production tricks, cheap or not, can compensate for a tune that is just plain BAD. And others follow suit. This is not well-crafted, durable music for all time. It is dated '80s junk that has not aged well. ""Let It Loose""? More like ""Let It Alone""."
5,A Helpful Analysis of the Cell Churches in America,"Joel's latest book is the application of years of watching and processing what is happening in the Christian church in America. Many have been attempting to apply Cell church methodology to the U.S. context, but few have been able to distill the driving elements and principles for success like Joel has in his latest book. It will undoubtable become a central tool for churches attempting to adopt a Cell Church approach."
3,Alladin travel 16oz coffee mug,The service from the seller was great--the product is just OK compared to the ones we usually use
3,mug review,"I was disapppointed that the mug is not insulated and not microwaveable. I like the design, and will use it for other beverages."
2,Good Idea--But Not Functional,"I had reviewed this earlier and thought it was a great mug. I had only had it a few days. I was very disappointed it could not be microwaved.Now, after having the mug for a long time I am even more disappointed. I have not microwaved it and only use it for very hot coffee. Well, the cup is slowly cracking apart. I don't think it can handle the temperature of boiling water. I think it might be OK if you drink everything tepid.Sad, sad, sad. I love the look and the design but the functionality stinks."
3,Rosie strikes back!,"Rosanne Cash's career reached it's commercial peak with this album, which featured four #1 Country hits (""The Way We Make a Broken Heart"", ""Tennessee Flat Top Box"", ""If You Change Your Mind"" and ""Runaway Train""). It's a solid album that should appeal to fans of female country singers."
4,Dnascardaddy,Good product for the priceonly wish it had handles on the sideother than that great prouduct!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"Good cheap bag, but thats it","If you are concerned about the quality and need this to protect something expensive, invest in something else to protect your stuff. I used this for pillows and blankets storage for camping. Plastic locking buckle feels cheap, material is thick. Remember this is a large bag that can fit a lot of stuff. Cant beat the price though!"
3,Hard to handle,"These bags are roomy, but lack a top or side handle or some way to carry them more easily. This makes a bag full of gear to be very difficult and cumbersome to handle. Otherwise, the bags are huge, protect well their contents, and since they're see-through, it's easy to locate objects inside before emptying the whole bag. The yellow straps on the body of the bag are to tread some rope and secure it to the roof rack or another piece of equipment."
4,big bag,"Bag was exactly what I was looking for, except it was just too big for what I needed it for. I am looking for the exact bag except for smaller (for scuba diving) because it is great you can see exactly what is inside it and it seemed very durable."
1,Coleman Dry Bag,This bag is enormous and not flexible like some of the other materials dry bags are made of. I didn't like it.
3,Same as the content of many other books and a little out of date,OK but as with many other books like this doesn't mention that succeeding in any business takes a awful lot of hard work.
2,be aware,"that this also contains 150 IU of vit E and the recommended daily dose is 90. if you take a multi your already getting 100% of E not counting what you may ingest in your diet. long term excessive doses of vit E are not heart healthy, not sure why Tishon formulated it this way."
4,"Yes, I'm a fan already","First off, DO NOT START with this disc!!! If you haven't heard or seen Dillinger Four before you will probably not like this. If you have seen them...well, mabye you will. The disc is about bootleg quality and that's at the high points. Personally, I think they're amazing. And this is very much like a Dillinger Four show. So if you know what you're getting in to then you need this otherwise grab a studio album instead. By the way, I just saw them play a punk house in Minneapolis called The Alamo and, even though I've seen them tons of times, it was one of the better shows I can remember. ROCK ON D4!!!"
5,Forced Democracy,"If anyone wants to know the result of America's invasion of Iraq, he/she should read this book. The author, a renowned journalist, writes about the personal tragedy of Iraqis during and after the invasion. This book gives the reader much insight about an unjust war and the actions of the occupier that reflect on the aggressor nation. Does forcing democracy on a nation work?"
5,night draws near,I got this book new from amazon. Great condition. I bought new books from amazon for less than used books at the bookstore!
4,A Note of Caution for Those Considering Buying the Audio CD,"I read the book and thought it excellent, so I purchased the audio CD for my mother. Unfortunately, after trying to listen to half of NIGHT DRAWS NEAR twice, she gave up on the book. According to her, Shadid read his work at such a quick clip that he was difficult to follow. After listening to a disc myself, I agree. Because of the complexity of many of Shadid's sentences, a listener needs lengthier pauses than Shadid gives one in order to digest and truly appreciate all that has been written."
2,I've been spoiled by better books,"The first half of the book is boring and the second half is too detached.And by detached I mean I couldn't quite tell what he thought of all the madness he saw. As for his account of the American presence, its a little too rosey. I suspect one doesn't win a Pulitzer by upsetting the powers that be too much. I do believe Mr. Shalid has feelings for the Iraqi people he interviewed but it hardly came across in the book. There are much better books out there about Iraq that moved me: Patrick Cockburn's ""The occupation"", Aaron Glantz's ""How We Lost Iraq"" and by far the best is Paul William Robert's ""A War Against Truth"". These books deserve the attention that this book has gotten."
2,No Balance,"This book covers the author's interviews (and other experiences) with several Iraqis. If you are interested in a psycological study of ""Dead Ender"" Iraqis and their family support network, you will like this. There is very little positive and little balance to the book. Though the author is just ""reporting"" and not trying to overtly prove specific points, the gist of this book is that the Iraqis are too screwed up and stuck in the past to live outside tyranny and that the United States should realize that but doesn't."
5,He loves it,My boyfriend bought these for work since he has a bad sweating problem and they work out great for him.
4,great product,"This is a great product. I use it when I run or do other activities that make me sweat lots. I have a shaved head, so it really helps keep sweat out of the eyes. My only negative comment is that when it gets wet, it looses a bit of elasticity, so it could fit a bit tighter. Even with that, I would definitely recommend it."
4,Great for cooler days,Works great when I sweat less on cooler days. My Headsweats Beanie is preferable on hot days because it wicks away more sweat than my SweatVac.
3,Good sweat cap,"It helps keep the sweat out of your eyes like it should, it's a little warmer than I would like around the forehead but cooler on top. I think headsweats has a better skullcap.http://www.amazon.com/Headsweats-8804-201-Skullcap-White/dp/B002LV0ABA"
2,Just another rerelease,I just bought this as a present for a huge springsteen fan. I didn't know that this is a rerelease of a previous dvd with a different name. Be careful when buying this item.... You could already own it under a different name.
3,When it worked...,"When it worked, it worked very well and I was happy. Resolution was excellent, low light excellent, really all was perfect (I did not use it wireless, mine was wired into my network and used outdoors with the D-Link outdoor heated housing). About 1 year later it stopped taking any commands and then stopped working. So, it was great while it lasted. I replaced it with the lower level D-Link DCS-5300. You can read my review on that one if you like."
1,Purchase something else,"The first one I received was defective. That can happen with anything manufactured. The replacement(very fast, Thanks Amazon) was not a problem getting it to work, keeping it working was a problem. Camera would just quit working for no reason - black screen. Let it set for some time (cool) and it would come back on. Unit did get very warm, but not to the point it would cause a fire. Zoom and focus was OK, along with moving the camera. Forget about wireless! After hours of attempts, even with a person that works in that field, we could not get it to work unless it was hard wired. No support from company. Some have stated it needed a firmware upgrade. That may be the cause of most of the problems. Something that cost as much as that camera should do a much better job.I did what I thought was the best action to take, return for refund. Best thing to do is look at other cameras."
1,Do not buy this camera,"I'm a software developer - believe me when I say - do not buy this camera. It freezes up constantly, loses its wireless grip, doesn't return reliably to location settings... All in all a great concept but D-Link doesn't deliver. No tech support. I had to return mine to Amazon. Funny, I then tried a 3220G and it died as soon as I applied the latest firmware. Don't waste your time with these cameras."
4,Video Security Camera,"This particular Cam has some issues but as long as you understand how to configure it, it will blow you away. I've heard people complain about Dlink and they do have to get on the ball with tech support, autually their tech support sucks but I don't need them. This is not a plug and play device so study the online manual carefully. When you actually learn how to use it, you won't buy anything else for the price. If you are tech savey, you will really enjoy the product. I have nine cams installed at three locations. Using their IP software you can view upto 16 at once. The reason I'm back, on this site, is because I need to order two more. I did have to return my first one but it was a pre-production unit and somebody forgot a timing gear. Dlink sent my replacement direct. The oldest cam has worked flawlessly for a year now. One last comment, the next closent cam is a panasonic but for equal quality you will pay 50% more with less features."
1,What a piece of junk,"I have many cameras, network and otherwise, PTZ and fixed, and this is by far the worst one. It has difficulty focusing, it's noisy, doesn't hold presets well, and the image appears to start ""melting"" every few seconds, then snaps back to clear. The wireless connection is pretty reliable, but that's about all I can count on. The API support for this thing is nil, along with the options they give you. Tech support is usually no help at all. I just purchased an Axis 213 PTZ, and it completely blows this thing out of the water. No more DLink for me."
4,Very Good!,This product is the must have for those who want to write exams or test. I tried different books before with no significant result. This one is really helpful.
2,Scary Magical Ewoks,This cartoon focuses on Ewoks and their magic. It is more fantasy than Sci Fi. I found the episodes which are strung together without separate titles hard to follow and a bit inane. I think Lucasfilm could do better in the Star Wars universe.
2,No way to search for Kindle version,"The information in here is pretty good, but I bought it for quick reference use with my Kindle App on the iPhone and there is no way to look up something quickly. You have to go through page by page or guess with the slider ""progress bar"" to get to the letter of the term you want so it is not easy to use."
3,Moroccan Textile Embroidery,"Beautiful photographs of authentic embroidery and black and white's of 1930's Moroccan life. Very well researched. However, not a 'WOW' book."
1,This pamphlet contains no monologues...,"This title is a stapled pamphlet. It contains a wealth of one-act plays and scenes for 5-6 children, most of which require props. Unfortunately, there are no monologues to be had in this title."
5,The Peace Book,"This is a least the third copy of this book I have bought. It is a beautiful, simple book with a wonderful message. If you like Todd Parr you will love it. A lot of friends of my daughter are having babies and I knit a sweater and then enclose this book for either the new baby or the siblings."
4,"Beautiful Colors, 3 year old likes it a lot","This book is really nice because it isn't just about peace between people, but also the peace you find within and with the world around you. The colors are bright and pictures pop. Well done book."
3,"The book is wonderful, but beware of the binding!","This review pertains to the paperback version. This is a lovely book. My 2 year old asks for it all the time. I love the underlying message of being kind to ourselves, others and the planet. However, the cover fell off the second day we had it! The glue just didn't hold the pages in. It wasn't my toddler's fault; she wasn't being at all rough with it. I highly recommend the book, but recommend springing for the hardcover if you can."
5,scott hahn,"His books are easy to read and understand, and his perspective in insightful. Reading his books has helped me tremendously with my diaconate studies. I have used his material in some of my RCIA classes when explaining certain aspects of Catholicism."
4,deep stuff,"In his prolouge Professor Hahn warns the reader that this book is not going be just like his previous popular works. Letter and Spirit is a deep, scholarly work and is more in line with his journal pieces. None of the famous Hahn humor is on display here and I missed it.This aside, however, the book is very good. It gets deeply into the ancient beginings of our liturgy and would make an excellent gift for a seminarian."
3,Over The Top: A Bottom Up View,"When the Great War broke out in Europe in 1914, most Americans were convinced that the fighting had nothing to do with the United States. There were precious few with the foresight to demand that America enter the war on the side of the allies. Arthur Guy Empey wrote OVER THE TOP to show his countrymen that the battle that the allies were fighting was our battle as well. His book, which reads like a novel, is more of a personal narrative in which he describes his volunteering to join the British Army and fight 'over there.' Much of his book deals with the daily dreariness of the horrors of trench warfare. Empey skillfully draws a composite picture of the average Brit soldier, whom he nicknames Tommy. His book is at once brutal, comic, and mundane--much like trench warfare had to be. By the end, the reader becomes convinced with the justness of the British cause, which true enough and soon enough, became the American cause. A very fine book."
4,"A Work of Propaganda, but Still Worth the Read","For all the horror the narrator experiences as an American fighting for the British in World War I, he has a surprisingly sterile view of things. Author Empey spares no time to dissect his circumstances. He only lays out events as they happen in a blunt, journalistic fashion, detouring only to make some chest-thumping comment about defeating the Germans.Make no mistake, this is a propaganda piece. It wouldn't have been used to rally the American war effort otherwise.However, there's still plenty to take away from it. Life in the trenches, weaponry details, tactics and gallows humor pepper the narration. That's what kept me interested the whole way through.This isn't the quintessential World War I book. But given the role it played as a propaganda piece, it's worth a read for its historic value."
3,Works fine,Delivery was fast. The 12' length is a little deceiving. The cord hangs from the phone about 1 foot. The 12' is when the cord is stretched out all the way. Still it works fine.
3,It's OK,"I needed a new telephone handset cord and purchased this one based on some positive reviews. My previous cord was knotted and twisted and got to the point where I couldn't get it detangled.Was hoping this cord might be different and not have the knotting and twisting problems most cords do. It's definitely a well made cord, but after a few weeks I found it slowly starting to knot and twist....Comes with the territory I guess, was just hoping to get lucky and find a cord that would hold up better than most. This is a decent cord, but I will probably end up replacing it soon."
4,12 foot Pro Series phone cord,We got to where we needed a new cord on one of our phones. I didn't want to buy a real long cord and I wanted a dark colored cord since my phone is dark green. All they have at the stores here is the long tan cord so when I saw this on Amazon for $3.00 with free shipping I jumped all over it. Now I am a happy camper. Lynn from Saint Louis Missouri.
4,works,"Does what it's supposed to. Nothing else to say. C'mon, what can you say abt a phone cord?? It works."
4,I like it,"It;s a cord not much to say, other than it works as indicated and is long enough so I don't pull the phone off the table."
2,More like 6 feet,It was longer than the cord that came with the phone but if you need a 12 foot cord you should buy the 24 foot cord.
2,Not As Advertised,"While it works fine, it is NOT a 12 foot cord as advertised. It's not any longer than the cord the phone came with. I'll keep it, but would never buy it again."
3,12 foot is a stretch!,Cord pulls phone way before 7 feet! You might get 12 feet with phone mounted but mine is on desk.25 feet might be to long but an 18 footer would work.
2,"6 feet long, NOT 12 feet u","6 feet long, NOT 12 feet unless you stretch it to the breaking point. Just a regular length cord. Decent quality"
5,May Knot,"I find this product purchased at Amazon to be well worth the price. The 12 ft. cord was delivered quickly. I'v used it several weeks, am very satisfied with this item and would recommend it. Just remember it is tightly coiled so it doesn't look to be 12 foot long."
3,Telephone handset cord,I purchased this to replace the much too short cord on the new telephone. It is purported to be 12 ft long; only if two able bodied people can apply enough tension to stretch it to its full length. All other aspects are satisfactory. The price was low and shipping relatively fast for US snail mail.
3,It doesn't seem 12 feet to me,"I ordered the 12 foot cord to accompany my land line phone. The cord is good, no static sounds, but I can barely span the length of my 42 inch kitchen table without the phone popping off the wall. I don't think it is 12 feet, but maybe it will stretch out a little bit. Otherwise, it is a great cord."
2,Pro series 12ftr Telephone Handset cord,I did not much care for this product. It seemed much too short for 12 feet. I guess if you stretch it full out it might measure the 12 ft. So I gave it away.
5,Phone cords and other items,Absolutely an excellent company to deal with. Fast service. Received items in perfect condition. Would deal again. Very satisfied with our first order.
4,good if used with detangler,"A good value in a handset cord (the one between the handset and the phone, NOT the phone and the wall). You need a detangler with this cord or else you will end up with a giant knot of wire in very short order. The detangler costs nearly as much as the cord but IMHO you need it. You can get them both from Amazon."
2,Short on cord,"Telephone cord is shorter than that stated on the label. I measured the cord be 6 ft only and NOT 12 ft as stated on label of package. I needed a 12 ft cord. The telephone cord, however, does work."
2,Length of cord,"The product description was a 12ft cord, but it was nowhere that long. They should be more accurate in stating that 'unstretched and measuring from where the curly part begins and ends ' would give a better indication. Connection to the phone was fine as was the sound quality."
4,"Good quality, shorter than you think","This is only slightly longer than a stock cable. Next time I would go with a 15'. I know that sounds excessive, but the usable length is really much less. I would estimate the 12' cord allows you to go 4-6ft away from the phone base before it pulls the phone off the desk.In summary: Its a great product, just know that 12' isn't its usable length."
2,Ugh.,"I returned this item. A cassette recorder/player that does NOT have FULL AUTO STOP is pretty lame. The comparable Sony machine is waaaay better; I just wish it weren't so hard to find. Personally, I would not recommend this item. Hey, RCA. It's 2009. Get with the program. FULL AUTO STOP, please!"
1,Stopped working after two months,This worked wonderfully for two months. Then it just stopped working. Not worth it! I should of checked the other reviews more carefully..
4,Great little microphone with this unit,"The tape recorder was okay for the price, but I was very happy to get the stand microphone and use it a lot for gaming. It's hard to get a desktop stand microphone for this price and this one has very decent quality, much better than those included with cheaper gaming headsets. The cord is a bit short to plug into a sound card at the back of the computer but very usable up front. Thanks RCA!"
1,Included external microphone didn't work,"Title speaks for itself.I tried out another working microphone and the recording worked well. The internal(built in) microphone seemed to work alright. Over all a very low quality tape recorder. Expect to find it at an All For A Dollar store. Wish I had. I suppose it gets the job done, not all is lost."
3,Cassette recorder review,"The original cassette player I ordered was very nice, but after listening to two tapes, it quit working. The seller replaced it right away with no problems and I now have the new unit. So far, so good!"
5,Great Tape Recorder,"This is a great tape recorder. I like the Mic that comes with it as well. I would tell a friend about it if they were looking for a tape recorder.And as a total plus, the price was right!"
1,Stopped Working after 2 Months,"I loved this product, when it was working, then one day, less than 2 months since I got it, it just stopped, went dead.Checked it, had someone else check it--but no, it's just not working anymore.It's inexpensive, yes, but when it stops working so soon, it would have been cheaper to have paid a little more for something with higher quality.RCA used to be a reliable brand... too bad..."
1,DO NOT BUY.,I purchased 3 of these units. I had to return them to manufacturer because they did not work correctly. I received 3 new ones....they did not work either. I am sending them back again and was told they would send me new ones again.
2,RCA Cassette Voice Recorder,"This product is lightweight and easy to hold. I do a lot of tape recording (voice recording) as a hobby and I found this recorder has poor quality in recording. It does not have a strong output either. I need a recorder that does not make me ""lisp"" when I speak and that will record without holding it up to my mouth."
1,wow this thing is bad,"This thing is an utter joke. You pick up just as much motor noise and buzz as you do what you are recording. The built in mic is terrible, and the external mic is exactly the same, just plugs in. There is no recording level adjustment, no features whatsoever to make it worth the $24. Cassette isn't digital, but man it's not this bad. Don't get it."
3,Adequate,"Bought this cassette recorder as an alternative to more expensive digital recorders to use as a scratch pad in my studio.Pros:Familiar, simple use.Reasonably clear playback.Mic works pretty well as an area mic, picking up guitar and vocals while positioned next to my computer keyboard.Cons:Shuttle buttons are flimsy and don't always move the internal mechanical linkages.Mic is top-heavy. I'll probably epoxy a small piece of cardboard to the base to stabilize it.Summary:Considering the cost of tape, effort of archiving/cataloging, it might make more sence to get a digital recorder for 100USD."
3,Can't agree with author's view of the viceroy,"Enjoyed the book and learned from it. However, in my view, Lady Mountbatten was the real hero. Lord Mountbatten no doubt performed as he was told, but I found very little that was admirable in the way the ""occupation"" of India was terminated. A great tragedy for the country and it's people."
1,sucky phone and battery,"This phone has sucky performance and the battery life went away fast. Now it hardly keeps a charge. The caller ID takes too long to come up and if I am in my backyard the phone starts ringing way too late. I have people tell me it rang three or four times before I pickup, except that I pick up during the first ring. I am throwing this away."
1,Killing me with this battery life,"I too am a victim of consumer reports. The battery life after 7 months is about 20 minutes of talk time and 3 hours off the charger. I even made sure to let it fully charge and die the first 3 or 4 times when I bought it. And what kills me is the batteries cost just about as much as the phone itself. Otherwise the phone works, stupid phone. But now I have to get another new phone to replace this one which replaced another GE piece of crap. Technology!! They put they can put a TV in a Refrigorator but they can't make a battery."
1,Save your pennies - get something better,"This phone is decent for awhile, but then slides into a downhill spiral.The battery life is pretty bad. I found that I could only talk for about an hour (or leave the phone off the cradle for a few hours) without the battery giving out.Awhile after I bought this phone, it started getting random static on the line. At first, I could switch channels and solve the problem, but then it became so bad that conversations were almost pointless. What's worse. I wasn't a hundred feet away from the base unit. I'd be sitting less then 3 feet from it!All in all, this product makes me wary of Panasonic phones. Clearly poorly designed and not well built."
1,worst phone ever,Battery is close to dead only after three months. The volume was never good. The worst phone ever bought.
2,thumbs down,This phone didn't last long at all - like everyone said - poor battery life is my guess. I've had a VTech for much longer and it is still working. I would not buy again!!
1,The most annoying phone ever!,"I got this phone two months ago after having another Panasonic phone, that I loved, for 7 years with no problems. But the battery does not work right! I get cut off in the middle of conversations all the time! And that's after having the phone hung up all night. I don't even get 30 minutes of talk time before the battery decides to cut out on me. I am throwing this phone in the trash. I'm very disappointed. I know it's a cheap phone so you can't expect much, but I have had cheaper corded phones that have lasted for years! Don't buy it!"
2,"Great phone, horrible battery","Phone works better than any cordless we have had, battery is now nearly completely dead after only 6 months of use. Trying to decide whether to spend $12 for a new battery or $20 for a new phone."
2,Battery no good; phone kaput.,"The battery supplied with this phone failed to sustain a charge about four or five months after I purchased the unit. I replaced it with a GE battery which worked properly thereafter. The phone itself stopped working about three years after purchase, although I never once dropped the receiver. I'm replacing it with a different brand."
1,You get what you paid for!!! Cheap = Cheap!!,"This was a cheap Panasonic phone that I picked up!! When they say you get what you paid for, it is true!!! The battery doesn't hold a charge!! Missing a lot of functions!! No light to blink when you have voice mail messages, no key pad on base, need to edit local incoming caller id to remove area code, etc. Low price = Cheap!!"
1,Waste of money,I started having problems with the battery within 3 months. It is a real dud. I would not advise anyone to buy this phone regardless of the inexpensive price.
1,No Captions!,"I was very disappointed in this DVD. I love Ellen and her sense of humor, but was not able to enjoy it since I am Deaf and this DVD has NO CAPTIONS or Sub-Titles. A waste of my money!"
2,"""These Friends of Mine""","The first series of Ellen is nothing like the others.This series features different characters. It is also not called Ellen it is called ""These Friends of Mine"".Truth be told the first season was a below average show. Without many likeable characters.If you are like me and love Ellen you will buy this boxset just so you can own the complete collection when the other series are released on DVD.Spence, Audrey, Paige and Joe are not in this series. Truth be told this is completely different from the other series including the humor.The only similarity is Ellen Degeneres."
3,"Funny, but lacking.","I grew up watching ""Ellen"" back in the 1990's when it was still a hit show, then ratings crumbled once she came ""out of the closet"". After buying the DVD of Seasons 1 and watching all of the episodes, it just didn't seem as funny or enjoyable as I had remembered it being. Don't get me wrong, Ellen is a hoot, but something seemed lacking. Maybe the show got funnier as it progressed over the years. Season 1 is a 3 out of 5 stars for me. It's definitely not one of the modern classic sitcoms I have on DVD that I can watch over and over again, like ""Will & Grace"", ""The Golden Girls"", or ""Roseanne""."
4,I enjoy this..,"I enjoy this show. The adorable Adam and Page are what make this show so good, and Jeremy Piven does not comeonto the show untill later.. Maybe season two is better, as this is when these characters arrive with the actors we know. .Page is played best by Joely Fischer.. the Desperate Housewives star. .Ari Gross is unreplaceable.. Ellen is also not replaceable, and what a powerful and wonderful person. The shenanigans of these actors make this a classic. No hardcore issues at this point with Lesbianism and whatnot. Easy to watch with your mom. Ellen will always be a genius and the beloved ""Lucy"" of ""I love Lucy"" is evoked for inspiration for this series. Ellen will always cheer me up, Vanes"
2,Spoiled by bad laugh track,"I don't think I've ever said this about a show, but what spoils this for me is an extremely bad laugh track. Not the way you think though, where there are giant guffaws over the slightest things...no, the thing here is it's so badly mis-timed. It's like whoever was responsible for this had no sense of humor or timing. Great jokes get nothing, mediocre jokes get big laughs. It's very strange."
2,Little disappointing...can't wait for the rest of the series,"The DVD set of the first season of 'Ellen' is a little disappointing. There are all the episodes but commentary only on the pilot episode (and not even a good commentary) -- not even closed caption subtitles in English. The first season is a little weak but the show gets much better in later seasons and I am anxiously awaiting them, hoping that the 'bonus' features will be much better on these later DVD releases than they were on the bare-bones season 1 DVD.Also, the Amazon description of Ellen as a ""Lesbian Bookstore Owner"" is a little misleading. It's only in the later seasons (4th ?) where she comes out."
2,Don't Bother.......,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE Ellen but the first season was soooooo disappointing. It got so much better the following seasons withAudrey, Joe, .....and of course the book store. These "" friends"" just don't cut it. The story lines were just not funny ."
4,Great Ellen!,Fun Ellen from the past! Her character friends and parents add to the fun. It is before she was so famous and it is a hidden gem!
3,Just above average,"Ellen Degeneres is the best, and this is the only reason why I am buying this dvd collection. The humor is NOTHING like the other seasons, actually it isn't even ""that"" funny at times. But I know that by buying the first season the other seasons will be released as well. And THAT is what I am aiming for.So please if u r a fan of Ellen Degeneres buy this box and allow the other ones 2 come out of the studio's closet."
2,Disjointed Story,"The illustrations are the best part of this book. Beautifully detailed, in rich colors, they do a better job of telling the story than the text itself. The text is disjointed at times, and when I have read this book aloud to children they often get confused with the story."
3,this is some strange music,"I ended up with this recording because of my habit of buying random releases of unfamiliar music from the cpo label.This is some strange music. It is generally rather sparce, with delicate, chamber-music textures pervading, with occasional use of the full orchestra in all of its sonic splendor. The music mostly consists of free, chromatic counterpoint. I do not know if the music is technically atonal, but harmony seems to be employed mainly for color. I find it interesting, but miss a sense of momentum. I will be listening again, and perhaps deeper insights will come, but at the moment I find it rather baffling."
2,not specifically stone/brick house restoration,"Although this is a nice picture book, it doesn't really deal with the restoration of stone houses per-se. Some info. on interior restoration which applies equally well to frame houses, some sketchy information on general building with masonry. HOWEVER, if you're specifically looking for a reference on repairs/restoration of structural stone/brick problems, look elsewhere. I've got a stone/brick house with bowed walls, collapsed foundation, collapsed arches above windows, etc., and none of these items was touched upon in the remotest fashion.If you're searching for something similar to what I'm looking for, look elsewhere. If you find something good, LET ME KNOW!!!"
1,Lacking real insight,"I was looking for a book that got into real details on how stone was quarried as well as on real construction techniques. My interest in in local buildings from the 1800's in the eastern US/Canada area.For me I find more value in books from Charles McRaven. And am still looking for a good book on historic techniques on quarrying, working with & building with stone.No need to waste your hard earned $$ on this one."
5,I think this book is a must have for every woman.,This book is one I recommend to all my friends. I have completed this study 2 times and have learned something different each time. It has helped me learn to write scripture based prayer and improved my diet. This is a book every woman should own and complete. Many thanks to Donna Partow for such a great Bible study.
4,Only on Day 4...,"So far I love this! A person needs to look at it to make sure that they will be able to completely submit to this though. There are several things required or at least recommended (foods, vitamins, exercise equipment). It is all in the front and there are no secrets."
4,Great for Small Groups,I was so excited to have this book available. It works well for individuals or small groups. Right now I have a group of 12 who are going through Becoming the Woman I Want to Be together. We also have implemented a Facebook Group page to stay connected in between meetings. Partow makes it easy to stay accountable to yourself by easing you into lifestyle changes. The number one focus of this book is as it should be--on God.
3,Nothing really new or interesting ...,"If you're totally clueless about nutrition, this book is for you. Since health, diet, and fitness are hobbies of mine, I'd like to think that I know a bit about each subject. There wasn't really anything new or exciting for me to latch on to and say, ""ah, maybe this will help with infertility problem"".This is why I found The Infertility Diet book quite bland and a complete waste of money.Monica, San Diego"
2,"A Disappointment, Overall","The only novel information in the book was on the studies linking a heavy yam diet with increased birth rate. I'd like to try the (true) yams (not sweet potatoes), but I haven't been able to find them (though I've gone to three health food stores). For people with already healthy diets and a reasonable understanding about fertility, the book will probably be a disappointment. Almost half its pages are devoted to recipes for yams, whole grains, tofu and the like. Your money is much better spent on Taking Charge of Your Fertility by Toni Weschler. Good luck to all who are trying to have a baby!"
2,Overated,"I expected this book to have solid information and backing as why you should or should not eat certain foods. I expected there to be scientific information and there is very little in this book. It is a very strict vegan diet with no junk, if this is not what you were thinking, do not bother wasting your money."
2,Not the best resource,"I questioned a lot of items in this book to my acupuncturist and neither one of us were impressed. When struggling with infertility women often grasp whatever information they can get and run with it. Take caution and do your research first... for example, a true ""yam"" as mentioned in the book is difficult to find in the US (google it!) and is often mistaken for a sweet potato. And kelp can mess with your thyroid if you have a thyroid condition (common in infertility). There is also some good research about the use of wheat (ie: NOT eating wheat) in infertility. DO YOUR RESEARCH."
4,A good how to!,This is a great book to get you started on improving your nutrition.Eating wholesome foods and supplementing with the right nutrients are critical for fertility and successful pregnancy.
3,Still not sure if I agree...,"I have the same feelings of many who gave mixed reviews on this book. After the frustration of being unable to maintain a pregnancy, I am desperate and will try just about anything, but now I am feeling MORE stressed because I am feeling too overwhelmed by this diet. Many of the suggestions are easy to incorporate, but I just realized I have been eating sweet potatoes, not yams and they are not available by me. I wonder by the recipes she suggests if she is using true african yams. From what I have read, they are huge! I think I am going to return the book and get something that suggests a menu that is healthy AND practical."
2,To complicated,"I was looking for different explanations how to achieve pregnancy after almost two years of trying with medical help. I always have thought that what we eat is what we get and so I bought this book.But I am really dissapointed by its advice. It is to complicated to follow! The ingredients are not common and if you have to work and eat outside your house every day, this diet is almost impossible to follow. Even the book becomes boring after the first chapters!I really think after this book that the best way to achieve pegnancy trough food is to have a balanced meal and that's it!All the rest has no value!Please save your money, other books are better."
1,Useless,"This book is useless to the average American. You have to give up several basic American food groups: junk food, fast food, instant food, restaurant food, to name a few. Oh, yeah, meat and dairy also. When you're all done with the dietary restrictions in this book, you'll buy all your food at a health-food store and cook all your meals from scratch from recipes in the book. And if your family doesn't want to do the same thing, you'll still have to feed them, since these meals don't resemble anything that Americans typically eat.Maybe the typical American diet is the root of a lot of infertility. But I think the book description and introduction should be clearer on how much work and sacrifice is necessary to follow this diet.I didn't actually try this diet. I could tell after reading the book that I wouldn't be able to do it. I barely cook, I eat most meals at restaurants, I travel a lot and my husband has hypoglycemia so is unable to eat this diet."
3,Good nutrition is important for improving fertility,"This is a very detailed book on types of foods women should eat and also avoid to achieve pregnancy. Many statements are backed up by research. I do not remember the author talking about the importance of keeping balance between proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.Dasha Trebichavska, licensed acupuncturist treating fertility issues in San Francisco"
2,Better be willing to overhaul your diet!,"This book had some valuable information, I'll give it that. But, for the most part, the diet is not something that your average woman will be able to follow. I want to have another baby very badly, but some of these changes are just not realistic. Several of the foods in the diet are close to impossible to get a hold of in your average small town grocery store. And your food choices will be very limited while on this diet. The fertility content of the book is basically verbatim from ""Taking Charge of Your Fertility"", so if you've read that (a must read!) you will not garnish much else from this book except for the actual diet and recipes. Overall, unfortunately, I felt the money I spent on this book would have been more well-spent on a different book."
1,where are the yams!!,"One of the KEY food items this instructs you to eat, is yams. No not sweet potatoes, which are often mislabeled as yams, but true yams. I have checked my local healthfood store (Whole Foods) and they don't sell them. Neither does my local supermarket store (Safeway). How are you supposed to follow this diet, if you can't even acquire one of the main items. There was some helpful information. However since the diet states you must eat all of the suggestions items and not just one or two, then I guess I can't do it without the yams. Thus, it was a big waste of my money."
5,Often Imitated an American Icon and Original,"A toast of Tennesee Whiskey to the man, the voice that is often emulated, but never duplicated. An American C/W icon in the timeless league as Hank Williams, Sr. No one can croon, belt out a song or touch a heart nerve like Ol George. He can take a song like ""He Stopped Loving Her Today..."" and take the enrapurted listener to his first love, last love or present love on the rocks. Few entertainers EVER have this power over listeners. Even if you aren't a C/W fan, this will change your mind....! Thanks, George.......from a loyal, grateful fan."
5,StonedAge,"Its the Flintstones!How could be anything but good.A total deligh!I needed it,I was burglarized over Xmas and lost thousands of dollars in top quality tools(They all have my name on them so if you see em please call the gendarms)."
2,Worth the prices,"We got this as a free download and it was worth every penny, if you know what I mean."
5,solid 5 stars,"There's only one word to describe this album: SICC. There's only one way to know what ""sicc"" means: listen to the album!"
3,Too many bad copies of this lens being produced...,"I got a bad copy. I read a ton of reviews online about this lens and knew that it was a crap shoot as to whether you'll get a good copy or a bad one, but the more you look it appears that there are quite a few bad examples being produced; so many, in fact, that it makes buying this lens a real gamble. For such spotty production the 1 year warranty from Sigma is simply too short and makes this lens a risk.I'm sending my copy back to Amazon (free shipping both ways and a 30 day exchange period are a real bonus with Amazon) and am getting a Tamron 17-50mm, which I hear may also have some quality issues, but at least the Tamron has a 6 year warranty.May luck be with you if you're ordering this lens, and don't throw away your Amazon shipping box/packaging until you've thoroughly tested it out. Mine had back-focusing issues at the wide end, fyi."
5,Nice quality,"Since I got this Cable, it hasn't been a single time that connection has dropped. The made quality is high for it's price and I'm happy with it."
4,Stupendous!1!,"It was epic! It was phenomenal! It exceeded every expectation I could have fathomed! Your life will never be the same, and neither will the consequences!1!!"
5,Works as expected,This cable is 50 feet and definitely snagless. We use it to put the office in another room from the company supplied cable splitter. We have not experienced any loss of speed or loss of data using this product.
4,Faster than expected,"The cable was a 'custom' build and I expected some delay, it was the first item of my order to make its way to my home. It is very flexible Works as expected."
3,Not able to use it,"We bought this to use in conjunction with Netflix. We thought our old cable was defective. For some reason, we still could not get Netflix going, so the cable is not being used."
3,Just OK. Good Price. Not Snagless!,"Works fine. Inexpensive. But it is NOT snagless.It can snag easily if not careful.It has some protection from snags.I prefer the ""Snagless Boot"" type of cable, with rubber boot to protect cable. Linksys cable, or cables sold by Ultra Spec on Amazon is better choice. Get ""Snagless Boot"" design!"
5,Belkin is BEST!,"My old cable wore out. Well, the plug did at least. I got pretty good use from it and it lasted a long time for a generic cable. Thing is it was just ""temporary"" until I could get a Belkin. But Temporary lasted 5 years. When it gave up the ghost I got what I intended to in the first place and just in time too. Our ISP offered us a higher speed connection and this new cable handles things like a champ. Streaming is great and no latency or lag. You can't beat Belkin for quality."
1,works sometimes.,At times its ok but other times it wont work at all. Must be a loose wire in there somewere. Fist time plugged it in and it didn't work thought it was just an abnormality because unplugged it and worked fine. Now however a couple months later it gave out completely. Should have sent it back than but o well its not expensive.
4,It Gets the Job Done,"This cable will do the trick. It gets the job done at a great price. Plug it into a computer, plug it into a router it works the same as any $60 priced cord you'd find at Best Buy."
5,good wire,this is a good wire. wont tangle. also it came it 2 days even though i wanted 3-5 day shipping!
5,Great cable for the price,I brought this cable because I was having trouble with my wireless signal with my Verizon DSL. I needed a long cable for my labtop in another part of my home.For only $12.90 this cable worked great. Now I don't have spend time playing with my network settings to try to get a signal.
5,Very good cable.,"Its a cable, it connects computers to routers, it works. Hows that for an indepth, cover all bases review? :)Seriously though, good cable. Would purchase again."
4,FILTERES WORKS GREAT,"The product is functionally fine, works great, cleans the water and you can see the difference.It is the great buy. It is money's worth."
1,WARNING: When wet this book smells like harsh chemicals,"This book was a gift from the grandparents and my 6 month old seems to enjoy playing with it HOWEVER, only a few minutes ago I began to smell a Really Strong Gas-like/Chemical Odor and after walking through our entire house I realized that this smell was coming from THIS BOOK after my son had drooled on it. I took a few sniffs because I was in shock and disbelief and am now washing it on a gentle cycle.Parents should use this item with caution because I cannot imagine what chemical is making the materials in this book smell so awful. I seriously feel like throwing it away just to be safe.Considering how babies put everything in their mouth I would be careful."
5,Wonderful book for Baby's First,I always have one or two of these on hand to give as baby gifts. It's a cute first book and one size fits all!
2,"Disappointed, one bottle not two","I was disaapointed to pay so much for one product, as I thought i was to get two. Quality of product not different than a much less costly brand at the local stores. Will not buy again. I do still like their nail polish."
1,Not the same scent,"I love the first one I ordered so much that I decided to re-order the item before I ran out. My second order from this company came in the same bottles, from the same company BUT it was not even close to the first scent I ordered. it was a different color and much, much thincker and smelled pretty bad. smelled more like cooking oil than anything else. I will not be ordering this agan."
2,Not the same,Received the Nag Champa. It doesn't smell like the Nag Champa I bought elsewhere from the same company. It smells like old aftershave. I'm not happy.
1,Nag Champa Oil,Wasn't impressed with this item only ot one use out of it cause liquid leaked thru the bottle. Didn't have no smell either. Love the fragrance of the Nag Champa but this product isn't worth the price.
3,nag champa oil,Received in record time in good condition....the only problem with this oil is it doesn't really have staying power when used as a body fragrance....smells wonderful but doesn't last long on skin..
3,Nag champa oil,"I love this oil and it is wonderful. When I recieved it however it was laking out in the bag, and a 1/4 of it was missing. This is crucial for me as I depend upon all and every drop of it to be there. I use this oil to make my natural products. I am somewhat dissapointed with this. I would love to continue purchasing the oil from this compant if they could possibly figure out a different way to ship it so it wouldnt arrive to me in this manner. Thank you much..."
1,if you want to stink out everybody around you...,then put a little... (and i do mean a little!) on and nobody will come near you! smells nothing like neg champa!
1,COMPLETE 2nd Season?,"I'm going to review this one in a nutshell as was done with Season 1...the only plusses here are Sabu vs Terry Funk and the few complete matches that are found under the episodes/bonus features. However, the majority of the set is made up of over 10 hrs of poor quality, bad scripting, bad acting,and more garbage(attempted drama) than actual wrestling. Considerably worse than Season 1...and not the end, unfortunately.If you're a fan of action/hardcore...stick to TNA, ROH, or even old school ECW. Here...you'll find more Rivera and Kris Kloss than anything else. Thumbs Down."
4,Cool controller,I bought this for my husband who is a gamer and also a dragon lover he loved it it was a super Christmas present.
3,Great headphones for music- bad for noise cancellation,"I ordered these headphones sight unseen from Amazon. The sound quality for music is incredible; however, the noise cancellation is sub-par. I ordered them to block (or help block) the ambient noise quality of the office, so I am rather disappointed. The price is astronomical for the quality of the noise cancellation. They don't drown voices or any other noises at all, so if you are looking to purchase them for noise cancellation, don't bother. I tried the Bose noise cancellation headphones but went with these because they were cheaper; needless to say I should have stuck with Bose. For all you who talk about low frequency vs. high frequency, I don't discriminate; I just want the noise stopped, and these didn't do it. If you are a professional DJ then these are the headphones for you. If you are an employed at an office- keep looking."
4,"Great noise cancelation, bad sound quality.","This headphone cancel out alot of sound especially on trains, buses, and airplanes. I liked this product but the sound quality is not worth the price, you can get a headphone that sounds a lot better at this price. I'd recommend this product only to people who like to travel frequently, and if you're looking for sound quality go buy the HD 595 or other non noise-canceling headphones. thanks for reading."
3,Not worth the money!!!,The Sennheiser PXC 350 headphones did not live up to the reviews posted about them. I received the headphones and unpacked them. They seem to be built good with quality materials. The problem I had was with hiss and the left speaker would make a loud buzzing sound sometimes. I tried changing the batteries and using the headphones with different music sources but still had the same problem.I have a wood stove with a blower on it. I used them to cancel the noise from the blower. They seemed to do the job. But I returned them because of the hiss and buzzing. I ordered the JVC HANC250 to replace these. The JVC headphones perform much better then the PXC 350 and they are very comfortable to wear. The JVCs get my vote. And they were $130.00 cheaper.
2,Average But Expensive Headphone,"I do not consider myself as an audiophile but I am into listening and creating music as a hobby and can differentiate between different products. I have Sharper Image (they are out of business now) headphones and PXC 350. Both are noise canceling. My review is based on difference between the two. I paid twice for PXC 250. It is tighter on head, bigger on ears, leather pads are less comfortable. Both cancel noise almost equally though Sharper Image does a better job. PXC 350 flattens all sounds, while in Sharper Image I can clearly hear bass and treble. I was carried both of them during my two 14 hrs trans-atlantic flights and tested them for different sound tracks. I would advise the readers to try few of these first in a store before you buy."
2,Made in Communist China,"I have been involved in the electronics industry since the mid 1970s. Considering the price of this product, there would still be plenty of profit if this headset were manufactured somewhere in the ""Free World"".Seller will not ship this item to a PO Box. This can be an inconvenience to many buyers.The plastic shell for the 3.5 mm plug is very large and I found that sometimes the protective cases for various products do not have a large enough opening to accommodate 3.5 mm plug.These protective cases have a hole in them so you can plug in ear phones or a headset. I tried two different cases for my iPod classic but the Sennheiser PXC 350 plug was to large to go through.I also found that the Sennheiser PXC 350 can't be used with a iPod nano when the Dock connector is in use do to the large size of its 3.5 mm plug. (Apple's 3.5 mm plug fits fine.)This headset has a power ON LED that is the correct color (Red, not Blue)."
5,Great phones,"Had to decide between Bose and Sennheiser, and decided for Sennheiser.Very happy with the overall quality of the headphones, very nice, balanced sound and a nice case including all the adapters you'll need when traveling on different airplanes."
4,Excellent choice for airline travel,"I bought these for air travel. If you want to eliminate 95% of the drone from the jet engines, these are great. They cover the whole ear and are very comfortable. They come in a large case but can be folded smaller. I found a canvas organizer at Duluth Trading that holds my Itouch and the headphones plus extras. They are well worth the investment."
2,Try a pair for fit before you buy,"These headphones have a rather strange fit. The cans are HUGE, and I just couldn't get them to fit nicely over the ear. They left a gap at the bottom of the ear, along the jawline. If I pushed them up (so that the bottom of my ear was touching the bottom of the can), then they didn't fit well at the top. I ended up returning them, and buying Bose QC15s, which fit my head perfectly. Maybe I have a small head, but I would recommend trying a pair for fit before buying."
3,Ear cushions inadequate,"The ear cushions on the headset do not fully seal around the ear and do not provide as much background noise cancellation as I would have thought. Boise headset cushions are much better at providing a full seal. Otherwise, the sound quality is good in active mode."
3,Where's the Bass?,"I just got my Sennheiser's out of the box and I have to say that I am pretty disappointed. The mid-range sound quality is awesome, and the Noice-cancelling works pretty well, but the headphones just die on the lower ranges. If you keep the music somewhat quiet, you won't notice anything wrong with a song that has a fair amount of base in it, but if you dial it up at all, you get that awful farting noise of a bass without enough depth for the song. Buy something less expensive."
2,"Good, while it lasted...","The headphones worked admirably for just over two years. Then, one day, they just didn't work any more.I'd be reluctant to buy Sennheiser again based on such a short service life."
4,complete noise canceling solution,"bought it from marketplace as refurbit has battery inside, that I can use it right awaythis headphones is actually HD380PRO plus noise cancelingthe sound is pretty good, but I notice bass goes down by 1-2dB with noise canceling enabledas some poster mentioned, it has some ""airy"" sound, I notice that when even moving my head, but it's not big deal for methe noise canceling is pretty good, tried on the subway, and I notice the big difference, it can surpass the roaring noise from the train effectively, that other noise canceling headphones can never achieve (PXC150, NC40)the headphones is HUGE, probably it's the biggest headphones I ever had, but it's pretty comfortable, I just don't understand why it has slanted screen design, which is not close to the speaker unit, that my ears touch the screen when putting on (this minor design flaw lost half of the star)great sound, great noise canceling, that makes it the best noise canceling headphones I ever had"
4,good product,"I took these headphone on several flights, Including 2 10 hour flights. They were comfortable for the shorter ones but the longer ones a little bothersome. I also have big ears so that may be why. As far as sound quality they were good not great. The noise cancelling worked very well they made the trip alot more enjoyable."
1,Nice-Looking But Not Comfortable,"These shoes are just adorable -- they look great on! But, even the first step was horribly uncomfortable. The straps rubbed my feet raw and caused them to bleed. I have worn many strappy sandals and the like and have never had this happen. These are the most uncomfortable pair of sandals I have ever had....what a shame."
2,nothing so far,"These seeds were inexpensive, but: I sowed these seeds in well-prepared soil on the central CA coast, and have watered them regularly for several weeks. So far not one seed (of thousands) has come up. I know germination varies with a lot of factors, but I am disappointed so far."
5,"Intelligent, adult fantasy","Genuine human moments; tense, realistic action scenes and a logical but completely surprising ending make this one of the best books I have read in the last couple of years.I'm not usually much of a fantasy reader, and the cover of this book almost made me set it down. But the author came highly recommended, so I took it to the counter and bought it.I couldn't be happier that I did. This is an intelligent, well-written novel that also tells an exciting story. I recommend it highly, and will search out the author's other works."
1,Fantasy Fanatic,"BORING!! The plot was implausible and improbable, not up to his usual standards. The writing was flat and uninteresting. I plodded through the book hoping it would get better--it didn't and I wasted alot of time (not to mention the price of the book). Too bad, the Ethshar series is MUCH better."
5,"SWEET BOOK, WOULD MAKE A SUPER MOVIE","ITS AWESOME! GREAT BOOK, SEQUEL IS NOT AS GOOD, BUT I THINK IT SETS UP THE PLOT NICELY FOR THE FINAL BOOK. I CNAT WAIT TO SEE HOW THE SERIES TURNS OUT."
5,Five stars,"This was my first Lawrence Watt-Evans novel, and I liked it. Smaug would've run whimpering from dragons like these (and so would I, for that matter!). Very cool."
2,Not worth the money,"I get a lot of use out of my Bose, moving it room to room easily, and getting decent quality sound. But, for the same price, I also got some audiophile speakers and receiver. This is not worth the price. For the same total price, buy a decent clock radio and a nice stereo and speakers on Ebay or Amazon instead."
5,Bose Wave,Fabulous compact music system. Unless you're going for a sophisticated component set-up this is your best bet.
4,INCONVENIENT IN THE BEDROOM,"No doubt, Bose makes a good product and I thought I'd be very happy with this purchase. I was planning to put this Wave System in my bedroom but wasn't happy for the following reasons: the clock was too small to read, inconvenience of having to use a remote control for all functions...think- alarm goes off, you want to turn it off but can't find the remote in the dark or see the correct symbols to control the system, and not having a full rich sound at lower volume settings. For these reasons, I returned the Wave System. For any other room, I'm sure this would be a great sound system but not for the bedroom."
2,Big bad bass,"I got this radio/cd player for my wife who is the primary listener. She seems to like it, but I am hard of hearing and don't like it at all. There is no way to alter the bass/treble of the sound, and as delivered the bass is very strong. I like to listen to voice radio and because the radio is so bass-heavy I cannot understand what is being said; it's all mooshy. Likewise, the bass ""thump, thump, thumps"" in popular music overwhelm the melody. But my wife, whose hearing is better than I'd like it to be, thinks it's fine."
5,Protect your system,"Make sure you use a surge protector with this system: I owned this system for several months when the CD player started behaving ""strangely."" It would play for a short period, and then stop. Fortunately I was still covered by warranty. Bose repaired the problem, and strongly recommended power-supply protection. I've had no problems since. Amazon would be wise to include such a recommendation to prospective customers."
1,NO HELP FROM BOSE,Was so happy to get a BOSE...then within a year the CD player reads unplayable and spits all CDs out. Unplug and it works hit and miss. Now doesn't work ever. Bose says send it back for $100 processing fee and they will DIAGNOSE it. WHAT??? I thought they had a good reputation and good follow-up service. Why did I pay 499.00? Piece of crap~very frustrating. Now I have to pitch the thing because after the $100 I don't know how much more it will be to repair the DEFECTIVE CD player! Very disappointing. In retrospect not worth the money.
2,Great Sound-Not so Great Otherwise,"I purchased the Bose Wave Music System for $499.95, after comparing similar systems. I think the audio quality is top notch - as claimed by Bose. However, their commitment statement that they ""use only the highest quality parts and the latest assembly and quality control techniques to ensure the reliability and long life of their product"" doesn't stand up. After about two years of infrequent use (less than once per week), the CD player suddenly stopped and was unable to read any disks. They did try to work with me over the phone to diagnose the problem, but were unsuccessful. I had to pack the unit up and send it back to them, and pay $119 for them to rebuild the CD player. I am surprised that the quality of this unit is so poor, and would not recommend anyone to purchase it if they plan on using the CD player."
4,Bose Wave System radio/CD,"WE are pretty satisfied with our Bose Wave System purchase from Amazon. However, the unit we bought was reported to be new, but was actually slightly used, and the package did not contain an operator's manual. That made us feel a little bit taken by the dealer.The unit itself works very well, and Bose deserves its great reputation for great sound from a small apckage. The CD drive has given us some fits as it rejects many disks that are in good condition but it will not load them. Don't know why, but some have worked after using a disk cleaning system on them."
1,BOSE = Buy Other Sound Equipment,"Ugh - I can't believe this thing doesn't cost $20, because that's the sound you get out of it.Even the most well-produced CD's from the mid-eighties when they still knew how to use the format sound like 128 compressed-to-hell .mp3's on this garbage.BOSE is a giant marketing scam. This little thing costs $499 for which you can get a half decent Yamaha receiver with Polk 5.1 system (or JBL, Paradigm, Klipsch, Infinity, etc.) which gives you roughly 30Hz - 20kHz frequency response (+/- 6dB)This Wave radio is about 280Hz - 13kHz +/-12dB which basically means it's rubbish.You're better off just burning your money that spending it on this nonsense.http://www.intellexual.net/bose.html"
1,"Save your money...buyer, BEWARE!!!","What a disappointment.In the mornings, I like to listen to talk radio on AM. With this product, forget about it!!! The AM reception is a joke (seriously). The Bose techs give you a couple of ideas...1)rotate the entire unit until the reception improves or 2)purchase a Terk ""Advantage"" cordless antenna and rotate that until reception improves.Both were ineffective. Unacceptable.The second problem I have is their return policy. Trust me, if you're not happy after 30 days, you are OUT OF LUCK - Bose will not accept the return or issue a credit.So, I say, don't bother. Who needs the hassle of an overpriced product backed up by professional techs who know how to get you off the phone and out of their lives, while feigning unawareness of the product's obvious deficiencies?"
3,After years of wanting....,"...a Bose Wave Radio, I finally invested in it only to be very disappointed. Unless you are a fan of heavy bass, this is not worth the money. The higher range is muffled and flat. Certainly not what I expected for $500. Aside from that, the CD player has no memory, no auto repeat, and the radio has no search or scan function. It bothers me that the only way to play the thing is with the itty bitty remote control which will probably be lost by the end of the week. I have 30 days to buy it or return it. Right now, I'm leaning toward returning. I'm so sad."
2,plastic box,This item sounds just like what it is--a little plastic box. It is extremely overpriced. It would be worth the value for about $150. I recommed putting your money into a traditional stereo system. I think you are paying about a hundred for the system and four hundred for the label.
4,Great Sound,This item was received in perfect condition and quickly. Just plugged it in and we had great sound for the holidays. I'm sure there are other products with higher fidelity but for us this item was perfect. We connected it to the big screen and listened to the star wars movie. I thought the storm troopers were coming in the doorway!
5,Bose the best,"Great sound, great looks, pricey but worth every penny! Replaces the large component system that took up a lot of space and block the window view in our dining room. It's like going from the large back breaking 500 lb big screen TV to the large plasma and HD flat screen TVs. I have purchase three Bose music systems in the last year - two radio/CD players - one for my 74 year old Mom and one for my dinning room and one entertainment system for my husband's Jazz room to go with his 52 plasma TV. My husband now wants to purchase another radio/CD player to replace the stereo component set and enhance our 42 plasma TV in our bedroom."
2,Very Disappointed,"I just received the Bose music system. This is the large unit which has a separate 5 disc CDchanger and a ipod docking system. I just got it this afternoon, hooked it up and popped in a CD. I couldn't believe what all the hype is about. I popped in another CD and the same thing. The sound is not that great and especially for over a thousand bucks. Just to compare I went to my present system and played the same CD's and my current system made the Bose sound like a cheap boom box. I'm a musician (for over 30 years) so music reproduction is something I really listen to and the Bose is not at all what all the advertising proclaims. I'm boxing it all up and sending it back to them. Save your money folks and go to a good stereo store and bring your favorite CD and listen to different systems and choose the one that sounds best to YOU. Don't fall for the advertising, infomercials and marketing schemes. It's way overpriced for what you get."
3,Slighly odd redesign and missing some features in the original Bose Wave,"The sound quality is still good, but the Wave II is missing some features the original Wave had - for example:1. Unlike the original Wave, there are no buttons on the unit - just try using the fiddly remote when you're half asleep. Impossible!2. You can't program CD track ordering.3. There is only one alarm. The original Wave had two alarms. Oddly enough, if you look closely with a torch, the front panel display on the Wave II has available digits to show a second alarm time, just below where the (first) alarm time is shown; the display also has alarm 1 and alarm 2 indicators as well. But the remote only has buttons to set a single alarm. Odd!4. The original Wave, via a special key combination, would show you how much power was left in the backup battery. The Wave II doesn't do this.Also, for UK customers, the DAB module is an ugly plastic separate box. At this price it should be built in."
4,Bose Wave Music System - Graphite Gray,I'd purchsed a $50 boom box from Sony that has severe distortion. The Bose unit seems overpriced at $5450 but at least it delivers decent sound.
2,Bose Wave System,"I bought the bose wave system knowing the reputation of quality and sound from Bose. Unfortunately, they system just stopped working after less than 6 months. I unplugged it several times and it still did not work. You can only operate the system with the remote. The sound is great, but there is something wrong within the system. I have seen numerous reviews expressing problems and disappointment with this system. I am very disappointed that Bose would charge so much for a product that does not have the quality to match the price. Reminds me of the recalls on the Toyota's. Reputations are going down the drain these days. The technician said he would send a new system and the old one should be returned. He didn't even put up a fight."
2,1 year warranty inadequate for a clock radio at this price.,"The sound is very good for its size...but for 500 dollars I would expect at the very least a TWO year warranty. The auto disc insert/eject is just asking for trouble. How would you feel if the disc starts to ""skip"" one day after the first year?My preferred alternate solution is to buy a Bose Concept 2 pair of speakers (100 dollars) and attach a cheap (i.e. disposable) portable cd/mp3 player to it."
3,Bose Wave Radio disappoints,"The Bose Wave Radio (with CD drive) has its good points and some not so good points.On the good side, it is very portable, simple to operate, and produces decent sound.On the not so good side, it is rather heavy and if you dropped it, goodbye. The remote control is the onlyaccess to functions, so do not lose it. For a $500 piece of audio equipment, IMO the sound lacks good midrange responseand the low end is too tight.I bought this for my wife, who likes it, but I would not buy it for myself."
5,bose wave music system,i think it's a great and loud system. i use it in my garage - workshop and it's quite a loud system. you can check my review here: [..]
2,No manual controls,"Never mind the hassle of misplacing the remote or it breaking down, Bose saves money on parts, but the customer does not.I read a few reviews and although I was sizing up a bose system, I have decided to not do it. The two stars is for sound quality."
4,Bose Wave music system,"Convenient size, easy to use. I like the remote. Stereo sound not quite as good as anticipated. Would be perfect with a set of external speakers added."
4,my review for bose wave cd/radio,got this as a birthday gift.out of the box in was easy to hook up. the design is a classic although to some people it could be plain. my motto is the simplier the better.its small enough to fit into a tiny space. sound quality is not too disappointing considering the size of the unit.overall I like the unit. its easy to operate via the remote.am/fm radio comes in handy too. so far the cd has been playing all original cd I have put in. I havent tried the cdr yet.
1,don't lose the remote or you'll have a great big....,"paperweight.What a piece of junk: the wave is completely useless without thee remote control.Lose that and there's no way to control the unit...it will just sit there.Here's a great way for Bose to increase revenue...the customer can either overspend on a new remote ($50)!!!! Or just get a new unit.I also have Bose speakers and while I paid for Bose quality I got the same quality as a cheap chinese knock piece of garbage!Good bye Bose, you're legacy is dead."
2,Don't get caught up in the hype !!,"Man, I fell into the hype about the BOSE WAVE RADIO ~~...For the $$, it is NOT worth it. It is an overpriced radio. I say that because I have not gotten one cd whether a personal mix OR COMMERCIAL to play, in its entirety.Each time I try, it skips or gets stuck. Oh, and when I purchased the multi-disc changer..that made the worst clunky and cheap sound when shifting between discs - IT WAS AWFUL! I returned that, but am stuck with a $500 radio.The names of the tracks don't play across the screen as touted by BOSE. I would sell it if I could. I WOULD NEVER BUY another BOSE ITEM. In fact, I very well may donate this one to a church.Now BOSE has a Wave radio with an ipod connector...Good Luck !!"
3,Sounds tinny,"I bought the Bose system because I want something compact with very good sound. I was expecting a much richer sound for the price. I am accustomed to inexpensive but adequate systems; ""inexpensive but adequate"" is about what this baby delivers. Except with no sub-woofer and no way to adjust levels. Also, and this would be true of any self-contained system, I discovered I prefer my sound diffused between speakers, not coming from just one source. So it's back to the inexpensive-but-actually-sounds better no-so-sleek nest of wires and components I've been using for years.I gave it three stars because it is neat and tidy, easily moved, and it does sound good--just not good enough."
1,SHOCKED!!!!!!!!!!!!,"SHOCKED!!!Satellite TV advertises this thing to death-all night long!!I suppose this is an o.k. product for anyone who has never heard a ""real"" stereo radio!Shocked at the price for a glorified transistor radio/clock radio/desk radio???""Room full of sound""?? Yeah, so will a transistor radio from the 70's!!Shocked-that a great American icon like Bose, would kick out junk-and at these shocking prices."
4,Seems fine,"I suppose I could have given it 5 stars, but I am not a big sterio guy and I didn't feel like this thing was the best thing since sliced bread... as it was advertised as... so 4 stars... works well, plays decently loud without distortion, although it won't blow your ears out or anything."
5,Good Bang for the Buck!,"I am no audio enthuasist and this is the first Bose product I have bought, but for my needs it is ideal. I have linked it to my TV/Cable box and it has made watching movies and listening to music ten times better. Set up was simple and the customer service people at Bose were great. I call the wave system a ""poor man's Bose"" but like I said, for me and my space and financial constraints it is great."
4,No Buzz Alarm,We already owe a Bose in our living room so when we redid the bedroom I was looking forward to replacing our cheap alarm clock/radio/cd player with the Bose. When it comes it sound quality its great and we already knew to get an extra remote....however my biggest complaint (and this is key in the bedroom) the alarm clock only wakes to music (radio/cd) what no old fashion alarm buzz (it never occured to me to check the literature on that and we never used the alarm on the living room model). So ifs important to you (and it is to me) be warned.
4,sounds nice but keeps turning on by itselrf,"I was very excited to finally get my own wave system. I bought the extra remote and got the ipod charger/player conncecion for free with the unit. I very much like the system overall but once in a while, it just goes on by itself. I dont know if it is possibly a neighbor using thier own remote and accidentally triggering my system or whether my system is defective. that is my only complaint however; I am very happy with the unit otherwise."
4,Great product,Love this product a great buy. I would have given it 5 stars but I just feel that BOSE charges too much for radios.
3,Little know fact about Bluetooth accessory,"If you intend to get the Bluetooth accessory for your Bose Wave system, Do not waste your money on the CD changer accessory. After speaking to a Bose representative and being told that I could add the bluetooth accessory later (if I chose to). I now have a radio & CD changer that Bose tells me is NOT software compatible with the Bluetooth device! My intent was to be able to utilize my older technology(CD's) as well as newer technology(Blutooth technolgy). So Please be careful. Bose software is not technologically advanced enough to deal with it's own products! It is obvious what Bose's number one goal is, regardless of the consumer. It's a great sounding radio. You just can't use it the way the Website suggests."
2,"Service great, product no so much","The product did not perform as it was supposed to and did not eject cd's, in fact it still has one of my wifes favorites; however, in the returning of the product the people on the phone were very professional and courtreous. They sent me a return Fed-X label for shipping and the refund was prompt."
4,Skeptic tries Bose....impressed by the sound...durability remains in question,"Ok, this is a compact unit, to look at...big clear sound....overpriced? Perhaps...but, Damn...it plays some great clear and honest music, at volume...I always like that about a stereo."
3,Bose will not turn on,"I purchased a Bose Wave Music System last year. It has played fine except for reception.I have not played it for about a month, and when I tried to turn it on this morning, it would not work. I changed the battery ( CR2032) thinking that maybe that was the problem. The radio still will not turn on. I unplugged it for a while and also took it to another part of the house and a different plug outlet. It does the same thing. The clock comes on and a ""please wait"" message flashes, but the radio will not turn on. There are no buttons or controls anywhere on the radio, so I cannot try to fix it from there. For as much as I paid for this radio/CD player, I am becoming very upset."
1,No Buttons - Big Hassle,I can't believe Bose has replaced a very nice system with one that you must control with a tiny remote. I have both their older models and I can't stand this new design.
1,Don't buy it,"I bought wave music system couple years ago. Sound is great. But I was upset that unit does not have any buttons on it to let you set desired option. Two remote controls, which come with it look really cheap, hard to manage and in two years does not work at all. I even cannot change the time.You would think for the price you can get something better. My advise don't buy it. Not worth it."
4,TAXES,I have never paid for taxes from the state that bose is from until I ordered this will never order from Bose again.No online taxes from there state to mine but they still collect the tax
3,0 degree rating is questionable,"Had a chance to use this bag in 22-25 degree weather and thought it would keep me warm, yet my feet were so cold that I could not sleep well. There were also cold spots here and there. I fell asleep in 29 degree weather (pretty comfy) and woke up when it was 22 and could not fall back to sleep. This is a mummy style bag, so there is not much room to move your feet around to get them warm up. There is also not much room to move your arms. It seems that after few times using this bag, the zipper is starting to get jammed up. At $30, you can't go wrong as long as you know its limitations. I will keep using this bag for 35ish and above weather."
4,Overall good bag,"The bag is of good quality, but a little bulkier than I would have liked. But with a compression sack the bag will work well for backpacking."
4,Warm and comfy,"This sleeping bag is very comfy and VERY warm. It is excellent for cold weather. I used it recently used it, but not for the right weather. It was too warm outside (about 40F) for this sleeping bag and I was rather hot the entire night. It is a good sleeping bag for camping in cold weather, but not for backpacking, or for warm weather. It is too big, bulky and heavy. It is hard to stuff it back into the stuff bag and it puts a lot of weight in your backpack.Apart from this, it is a great bag at an even greater price."
2,Not a 0 Degree Bag . . . more like 35 to 40 Degree Bag,"You get what you paid for with this bag. In the Fall of 2006, I took this bag to Flagstaff, Arizona for a weekend outing. I was cold on a 36 degree night when dressed in sweats. My feet were especially cold as there is not a ton of fill near the end of the bag. The next night it was 40 degrees and I was comfortable. For twenty dollars, it is a good 40 degree bag. However, I think you can find them cheaper elsewhere."
2,heavy and huge,"cheap but unfortunately not light and not small, if you planning on backpacking it's not a good choice."
1,"Wow, 0 Degrees?!","I recently purchased this sleeping bag to do my hike through the sierra nevada mountains. I am used to a very warm weather, I own a 400 dollar -15 degree sleeping bag, but I thought that it would be too heavy for my 214 mile walk and also too warm. I purchased this bag for around 35 dollars, which is a very good deal for a bag. But to my surprise, I was sleeping in pants and a sweatshirt inside the bag! It was a very comfy bag but I don't believe it meet my standard of a 0 degree bag. I should have spent the extra hundred bucks to get something that is actually a zero degree bag. Overall, it is a nice bag for someone who is just a recreational camper or just out for the weekend, or would also make a great gift maybe for a gag gift. Buy the bag, but use it to sleep indoors."
4,Probably wouldn't use in 0 degrees,"I like the bag. I've been out camping in northern Arizona a couple times this September (near Payson for those interested) and the overnight low gets to the mid 40's. I was most definitely kept warm but I got the feeling that at 30 degrees or colder it might not be so cozy. Looks like other reviews have pretty much said that this is not enough for sub 30 degrees let alone 0. However, if you aren't typically going to be cold weather camping I see no reason to spend a bunch of money on a bag unless it's just to show off that you have a bunch of money.I can also see where this bag could be cumbersome if one is backpacking/hiking. It is a bit bulky. In that case you are better off getting a bag specialized for those activities.Final verdict: Great for casual camping. Not for the serious hiker or cold weather camper."
4,"Stayed warm even at 12,000 ft in Colorado","I am very pleased with the Wenzel 2007 Windy Pass 0-Degree Mummy Sleeping Bag. I went on a week long camping trip in Colorado at the end of August and I stayed warm every night. Slept one night at 12,000 ft with the wind attacking the tent from time to time (temperature hit the lower 30's), and I was still cozy and warm. Slept one night under the stars at 9197 ft and never woke up cold. Hiked two days with it tied under my back pack, having never hiked before with all my gear it seemed all right to me for size and weight. The shoulder collar and the drawstring hood worked great. Having never used a mummy bag before I am very pleased with the performance and cost of this bag."
5,THE BEST,I saw this rated in The Week magazine. the best. small enough heart shape so not soggy.. buzzes when cooked to taste. We all love it.
3,classic wrestling,"jesse the body ventura is shown in his early career and doesnt speak which he is known for,washington state television wrestling action and mic promos."
5,More than stories,"Ed. Friedman told the ""story"" of how difficult it was to get his publisher to publish these ""fables"" because, as I remember him saying, ""they did not end right"". The publisher wanted to send an editor to Washington to help rewrite most of the stories. Ed asked the Editor (at Springer Press) to send the book back and he would find another publisher. The editor rethought his decision and asked if Ed would write a preface to the Fables, which he did. To read FRIEDMAN'S FABLES without this little edition (guidebook) leaves the reader without the tantalizing thoughts of the meaning of the stories. I have used the Fables in teaching, counseling, and for my own meditation on the twist of life."
5,Well worth it!,"This is a book that stands the test of time. It really speaks to multiple generations and can be used to teach multiple generations. I had a colleague say he used it for teaching youth and I recently used it in an adult study. One of the reasons the book can be used across many generations is because the writing it simplistic but does not talk down to the reader. The stories contain great lessons that everyone needs to hear and many of us need to hear over and over again.There is one thing that anyone contemplating purchasing this book should be aware of, that I was not: it comes with a study guide! The study guide has the morals listed as well as group questions. The study guide is a great addition if you are going to use this book for group study, a lesson, or just to have for your own edification."
4,A Narrative of the Principle,"Friedman takes the concepts from ""Generation to Generation"" and applies them in some of the oddest and most interesting stories. These stories prove to drive home the overarching points of Family Systems Theory and allow the reader to understand better how they fit in context."
2,disappointing,"This may benefit some parents but it just seemed like common sense to me, nothing new or exciting. Some of the things he wrote appeared to be only from his own experience and perspective and not supported by any research as far as I could tell."
1,Poorly written,"Here is an excerpt:""When I get back we'll talk. But right now I have to go."" said Marge. She picks up her luggage again and walks out of their home, leaving John standing there.The Dalmation comes up to John and sniffs at his hand and barks lightly. John, with tears streaming down his face, looks at his dog.(end excerpt)This is just a little snippet. So if you like poor grammar, POV mistakes, and verb tense confusion--hey, I ain't stoppin' ya."
4,Good Cat5e,"I am using this to run a wired connection to my new Roku XD from my router. So far things have been running fast and smooth. The packaging was annoying, but not impossible to open."
