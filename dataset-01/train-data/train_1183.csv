5,Really is as good as they say it is.,"Best desk mount your money can buy. Holds my 24"" wide-screen dell with no problems, took about 15 minutes to install. Very solid, adjustable, yet easy to move."
4,"No mounting bracket included for 24"" monitor","I'd give the arm itself a 5 star rating. Not disappointed in it at all.I just want to warn people that if they have a large monitor that they may need an adapter plate (bracket) that is NOT included with the arm.I have a Samsung SyncMaster 245bw that needs the wide bracket. The Ergotron company's suggested retail price is $50. Amazon charges $43 (if this is even the correct part) ""Wall Mount Bracket Kit"" found at the link ""Other products by Ergotron""...or if you have a few tools, you can do what I did and make your own out of a piece of scrap metal for $1."
5,wonderful gadget.,"This is an excelent product. Once you have the monitor mounted you can move it anywhere you need it to be. The arm requires a minimal amount of adjustment, but once you have tuned it you can push the screen into any positon you like with 2 fingers. It also frees up a lot of desk space. I highly recommend this product."
5,This is a great monitor arm.,"I have two right now and a third on the way. The current two are holding a pair of Samsung 226BW (one each) and the third will hold a Dell 20"". There is approximately 20-30 mins of setup for each arm as there are various pieces that need to be assembled. Assembly directions are only OK, they could be much more clear. Be sure you have enough lip on your desk or mounting surface to hold the entire assembly, this can be problematic. Once completed, be sure to tighten the torque bolts at all the joints to achieve the right degree of stability and mobility. (The bolts are sort of hidden, look carefully.) The cable holders are not too much help given their placement. Overall these arms look great and are absolutely functional. My back and neck thank Ergotron every day."
5,splendid ergotron,"i could say that i am more than satisfied with this product. it's material and quality are excellent. there is nothing less than it is described on the ergotron site. in fact the package contains ""more"" than i have expected. it contains all the accesories and tools that ate needed to mount yor monitor on the arm.(2 sizes of vesa mount and 2 types of desk mount[on the side of the desk or through a hole]). some may say that it is expensive but i dont believe that i could find something cheaper but that good.top quality.top buy"
5,A purchase for a lifetime,"I debated about which monitor arm or mount to purchase for a Samsung 20"" monitor, finally deciding to spend the extra $$'s for this Ergotron model. The arm is solidly constructed and extremely smooth in movement. Up, down, left, right, rotate 90(I especially like this option for full page work), draw it in close, push it back, tilt the screen up, tilt the screen down... it does it all. Another unforseen advantage is the wide open space I now have on my desktop ... room for more personal clutter!I can see eventually buying a new improved monitor, but fully expect this arm to last me the rest of my days. I am glad I spent the extra."
1,w31 Front Mats Scion tc Coupe bad design,We bought these mats for my Scion and the holes do not line up with the tabs that hold them in place and keep them from moving under the gas petal. We thought by buying these expensive mats that we would have a perfect fit. Customer service says they don't make custom mats if so why do you have to tell them exactly what car they are for. I could have spent 20.00 at Walmart and had a pair that would have fit the same or even better. Why do they put the holes in and sell them to you if the holes are not in the right place. What car do they fit? Not mine.Customer service is usless. No satisfaction. BUYER BEWARE.
3,Ok front worst back,"I ordered Weathertec floor mats for my F150 4 door they came quick about 5-7 days. The front fits okay not perfect could have more coverage, like over the front hump, online had no option. Back mats are so bad, must be for another truck. They do not lay down at all, sticking up everywhere, and do not cover the whole floor. BACK MATS ARE WORTHLESS. Would try to send them back, but after all the other reviews and the problems, I'm weary."
4,Digital mats,"I purchased a full set of the digital mats for my 2011 Subaru Forester. They fit perfectly and just slipped in. The grey matches my seats great. They do only cover the floor and up the sides about 4 inches. I am very happy EXCEPT for the cost. In my opinion, way over priced. But, I am still glad I bought them. Took about 10 days to get."
2,Lower your expectations,"My experience was similar to others who have reviewed/purchased these mats. One side fit fine but the passenger side was kind of off everywhere. I emailed Weathertech and they were a little defensive offering an explanation that they can't create an exact match for every vehicle out there and in the end they will send you what they believe to be the closest fit possible. That would be O.K. if that is how they marketed their product but they lead you to believe that each mat is a custom fit mat to your exact make and model. I would give them a break on their claims if they didn't charge top dollar while giving you a false sense of security that you are buying an exact fit mat. A good example of getting what you pay for as long as they used your exact model car as the prototype. If not, expect a poor fit."
2,"Cheaply made, way overpriced","I ordered a set of WeatherTech laser fit mats for my 2010 BMW X5. This product is really disappointing. The passenger and second row mats fit okay. But the driver mat is about inch too small all around. It constantly slides around. They are all made of thin shinny plastic, with no grid underneath to hold them in place. I called their customer service and I was told that I had to use Velcro to hold the driver side mat from moving around! Really? How about producing a mat that actually fits? McNeil never misses an opportunity to tell Americans that these mats are made in the USA. Sorry to say that the quality of this product couldn't compete with cheap Chinese knock offs.Bottom line, this is a cheaply made product that is way overpriced."
1,weathertech.com,"I bought two sets of mats. Set for Ford Escape fit okay. The rear Mustang mats fit terribly. I called and was told to cut to fit. I measured and even if cut, would be too wide, so mats were returned. It took forever to get a credit, multiple emails and excuses! I finally put an amount in dispute with my CC company. When credit was given, it was for the original cost but did not include a refund of the ""original shipping cost,"" as promised by Maria Z.Never again will I do business with WeatherTech!"
1,"They do not fit 2013 Ford Explorer, they do dot protect the carpet on the rocker Panels (the area as you get in).","They do not fit 2013 Ford Explorer the carpet by the front doors is unprotected, the area that gets the most abuse as you get in (rocker panels) You can buy cheap mats that will give the same un-protection.And customer the service manger is the type of person that give companies a bad name.They look good, but I would never buy from Weathertech again."
4,Very nice,"Very nice, high quality floor mats. Only 4 stars though because the passenger side mat has a tendency to slide around some since there is no locking attachment on that side like there is on the drivers side. I'd have designed the passenger side mat to have some spikes on the bottom to keep it in place, hence the 4 star instead of 5..2006 F150 FX4 Super Cab"
1,Terrible Product,"My dad, a mechanic of 30+ years, ordered a set of Weathertech custom fit floor liners for my mom's car. They arrived and they did not fit at all. When I called customer service, they were very rude and claimed that my mom had ordered them incorrectly. After being incredibly disrespectful, they offered to take them back if we paid to ship them back to them. My dad paid $150 for a set of floor liners that were worse than a $40 set from AutoZone. Do not waste your money. Terrible product. Terrible customer service. Terrible company. (My dad has never negatively reviewed a product like this before, but he asked me to do this because he was so disappointed.)"
3,Nothing surtom about it,Weather Tech Floor Mats. Granted these are for a 10 year old vehicle but The specific make and model and year were on the list. Narrow by an inch. Will either have a gap by the door or a section curling up under the gas pedal.Wrong cut out for the wheel well. Nice material but so unimpressed with fit. Not worth it.These were available on line only. But arrived with a display hanger. I think I got substituted with generic.
2,Overpriced and Bad Service,"Ordered Weathertech floor mats for my mom for Christmas (2004 Prius). It took nearly 1 month to receive the mats. Don't bother calling customer service as you will likely be on hold for more than a half an hour. When I finally received the floor mats, I was not impressed with the quality when considering the cost (over $120 for just the fronts). Wouldn't purchase from Weathertech again, that's for sure."
2,Improper fit on product,I just received the front floor mats for my 2005 Honda Pilot. The passenger side mat fits great. The driver's side mat does not fit well: the molding for the driver's footrest does not match my car. The distance between the attachment pin and the start of the footrest ramp is off by three inches.
1,The all weather mats don't fit and customer service is lacking,"I purchased a set of WeatherTech all weather mats for my 2002 FJ Cruiser. If you own a FJ DON'T BUY THESE MATS. They don't fit, the formed well for the stock mats is smaller than the WeatherTech mats and as thus they leave a pocket just in front of the accelerator peddle. This pocket is where you would place your foot and cause the mats to lift up under the peddle. Remember the Toyota Recall for floor mats interfing with the accelerator?I contacted the company and request to return the mats for a full refund, they indicated they will pay only one way,I have to eat the shipping cost for the other direction. I find this completely unacceptable, I thought I was dealing with a quality company, regretfully they are lacking in this area. I will never purchase from this company again."
3,Poor Fit / Overpriced,"Ordered a set of front mats for my 2005 Ford Sport Trac. Quality is average, price above average. Fit is poor. Took out old mats as told, but floor clips are in the wrong places to hold down new mats. Directions say to make sure to use floor clips so new mats don't move around. I could have just gone to any auto store and purchased a much less expensive set that would have fit the same way. Oh well, another lesson learned."
2,Cheap material,"Bought those for my Subaru. Very cheap material, poor design. Especially considering the price WeatherTech is selling it for. Front mats do not have carpet spikes underneath. It slides around, making it difficult to get in and out the car. Most likely you will be much better buying from a different manufacturer"
1,"All Weather, Bad Fit","I ordered the All Weather, Weathertech floor mats for my Audi A3. While they look good, they don't fit. The notches to stop the mat from slidding onto the accelorator and causing a bad accident, do not fit. Weathertech would not pay the shipping to send these mats that don't fit back. They offered to sell me the digital ones for $169 that might fit. Do not buy Weathertech. They do not stand behind their products and they do not fit the car."
5,Came quickly....fit great,"These floor mats are great. Yes, they are pricey, but they will keep your carpets (and original mats, since they are removed) clean and looking new. Got both front and rear digitalfit liners and the cargo liner. The front seats fit almost exactly right from the start. The extremely minor variances in one or two spots look they will fit once the mats sit for a bit in the car. The rear seats fit perfectly. The cargo liner fit perfectly also. As opposed to some other reviews, we ordered the digitalfit liners on Sunday and received them on Tuesday. Two days! Fantastic. Will definitely buy these for my other cars."
5,weathertech mats,"ordered from amazon i received front,back,cargo mat in two days fit perfect looks good wife's car she's happy. thank you"
1,Misleading imagery save your money,I bought these for my husband on our wedding anniversary so can't return them but definitely would otherwise they are not worth it. The image shows a close fit and how they fit over part of the door sill this is not correct it gaps at the side by the drivers door. I rang Weathertech and there answer was ITS ONLY A REPRESENTATION well it's a false representation my hubby's car was a 2010 Lincoln MKS so not an older model. DON'T BUY U WILL B DISAPPOINTED
1,Impossible to clean,"Bought two set, one for my Pick Up and one for my Mustang. The order form asked what cars they were going in. The Mustang set didn't fit (no hole) and are really hard to clean and the pick up set fits good but are impossible to clean. Always dirt left even using a power washer. I would have been better of with a cheap set for $20 instead of over a $100.00. Oh well live and learn."
2,WeatherTech All Weather Floor Mats (False Advertising),"I bought a set of WeatherTech All Weather Floor Mats for my 08 Honda Element.The picture on their site shows what looks similar to my floor board of my car with the floor mat fitting perfectly.I go to put them in and they DO NOT fit at all!I called to get an RMA# so I could send the product back, I explain I felt mislead about the product from the picture on the site and the rep acted like I was stupid for buying the product.I feel they MISREPRESENTED the product I bought, the mats do not fit and I am out $30. in shipping fees to get my money back!I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER PRODUCT FROM WEATHERTECH.COM!"
2,"Good contour fit, but texture could be improved",I purchased a set of these mats for a Toyota RAV4. The contour fit is very good and they appear to be of good quality. The texture could be improved to provide better foot traction when wet. Climbing in and out of the vehicle with wet feet causes a lot of slipping. This is the only reason I would not give the product 5 stars.
3,Shipping took forever!,"I got the digital fit floor liners for my 4Runner, I like the product but I feel that they are way too expensive. $177 for front and rear liners. It took nearly a month to even ship the product. I called customer service and they told me everytime that they were behind, though website says that I should allow 7-10 buisness days for shipping. I patiently allowed 22 days!!! I will not be purchasing anything from this company ever again."
1,Dirty,"I am very disappointed in the Weathertech floor mats for my F-150. The fit is not perfect and I cannot get them clean. I scrub with soapy water and then rinse with clean water and when dry, they still look dirty. 2 months old and they look old and shabby. For the money, $200, they are very poor value, I feel I was ripped off"
2,Expensive garbage,"Bought these mats for my subaru, the fit and finish is very pour for the price I payed. The front mats fit too loosely and do not have carpet spikes underneath. The mats slide around and make it difficult to get in and out. I should have bought husky liners like my husband has in his truck. They fit good and do not more, oh yah and they are alot cheaper. Knowing what I know now I would never buy these, so dont you make the same mistake."
2,Franklin disappoints again,"The advertizing for this item says that it 'Speaks over 200,000 translations and 12,000 travel phrases in high quality synthesized and recorded speech.' It doesn't explain that all of the spoken material is in English only. This is at best highly misleading. I purchased this item so that my daughter would be able to learn French. (She already speaks perfect English). I decided to return this item."
2,"too much material to cover in time allotment,casting misses","not only too much material trying to cover but wrong casting.Love mr. Hopkins but get real.the back and forth,flash backs made it seem that the film was more like patchwork.Sort of left unfinished just seemed not quite able to pull it together."
4,explosive and extrodinary,"Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal, Hearts Of Atlantis) and Nicole Kidman (Dogville, Birthday Girl) deliver yet again more explosive and powerful performances to their list. Ed Harris (The Rock, The Hours) delivers a ferocious and in your face role and Gary Sinise (Snake Eyes, The Big Bounce) is just fine. Wentworth Miller (Dinotopia, Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer) who portraits Hopkins in younger form does his best as well. Despite some moments of lulls this movie sends the goods with its rich characterizations and atmosphere. Though everyone in the god awful earth should know its difficult to adapt a novel into a script...derrr..idiots. Finely directed and it extremely pulls you in. Also starring Harry Lennix (The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions) and Clark Gregg (We Were Soldiers)."
2,An appalling waste of talent.,"The Human Stain has a dream cast, but each star is shockingly miscast. Anthony Hopkins and Nicole Kidman lead the list of Oops, I shouldn't be here, but are closely followed by Gary Sinise and Ed Harris. So mujch talent, so sadly wasted. i actually felt embarassed for Hopkins. Better luck next time!"
2,"Big artists, mediocre work","I was really anxious to see this movie. I have aleays loved Hopkins and Kidman and Harris is a great supporting actor for every film.But this film is really disappointing. Not only for the actors, but for the story which is too confusing and plenty of flashes-back. The accident in the first scene is also a failure, because the film loses all interest. Sinise's part is really strange: he appears in the beginning till Hopkins refuses to continue writing his book; in the middle of the film (I had forgotten of him) he appears in a dinner with Hopkins and Kidman and, then, forgotten. At the very end of the film, Sinise's character is again in the screen and now he plays the main role.Hopkins' play is really decent (I was fed up of dangerous-minds characters), but I think he is over-exploited. Kidman's is really not her best acting: extremely bitter and unexpressive.To sum up, a really boring film and, sometimes, uncomprehensible."
3,"Leave the ""Love Story"" out.","This movie started out excellently. I thought they should have shown more of the young Silk with his family. It also seemed that Jacinta Barrett was trying to stay with him until she realized his mother would never approve. They should have shown him trying to decide whether to embrace his blackness and see if he could still keep his job or at least go to court and fight the charges while still remaining undercover. The love story was totally unnecessary to the development of the plot, and the ending seems like they ran out of ideas. I would have liked to see more of Wentworth Miller (his performance is worth watching the movie for) and Anna DeVere Smith. And yes, Anthony Hopkins was truly miscast."
3,"Watch for the flashbacks, not the present","This movie would have been wonderful if the focus was on Coleman's flashbacks to his college years, not on the jumbled-up present of his life. While the segments with Nicole Kidman's character drag on, the flashbacks present a wonderful picture of what it was like to be of a racially mixed background during racial tumultuous times. Wentworth Miller is wonderful as the young Coleman Silk (a role that should have given him more movie clout), and Anna Deveare Smith is stoic and touching as Silk's mother. Gary Sinise and Ed Harris shine in their present-day roles, but Anthony Hopkins and Nicole Kidman are by far the weakest links in this movie. Or, perhaps, their characters are by far the weakest links."
3,Moves you along,"I knew nothing about the movie before I saw it. I Thought it'd be some thriller, and I was wrong. Even though it's no thrill, it's still good. Good acting and an interesting plot. A little long, but it moves along smoothly."
4,Could have been better,"The part of the film dealing with the professor's mixed race background, which he hid from everyone, including his own wife, is riveting and educational. It's hard to believe that some Americans felt so ashamed of their backgrounds that they allowed racism to lead them down the path of rejecting their own flesh and blood to give the illusion that they were ""White"". Especially moving was the portrayal of the professor's Black mother, when he makes it clear that she is to have no part in his future.The part of the film dealing with Nicole Kidman's character and the grown up professor was less satisfying as it included scenes of gratuous nudity. We could have done without seeing Ms. Kidman's body once again.Also, the ending was not all that great. But I'll still give it a ""four"" for a good effort."
4,The old goat,"I was finally able to view this movie on DVD. It only had a limited theatre release.Although it was based on a novel; It is based on real situations.I personally knew a college Instructor who was let go for failing an afro-american who did not come to classes.Being involved in relationships with the baggage of violence by exspouses are practicly a daily occurance anymore.I would hoghly reccomend this for a must rent or buy. Anthony Hopkins is a great Actor and Nicole Kidman is a good actress.This movie could have as a subtitle ""a history of 20th/21st century america."
4,"Too many ideas, cluttered but worthwhile","Enough ideas for a dozen ordinary films, with some great sequences, and terrific acting from all concerned, I was engrossed from the beginning. No satisfactory artistic resolution as in a three act drama, but stimulating nonetheless."
3,Worth a Rental,"A 50 year old secret kept hidden from everyone is about to ruin Coleman Silk's life. Slow to get going, it does finally show a couple brief skin scenes near the end, notably one of Nicole Kidman. It was a worth a rental."
3,See This Film For Ed Harris' Performance,"""The Human Stain"" is very watchable. It does have flaws however.Not the least of which is the miscasting of Anthony Hopkins. The story is interesting, and holds one's interest for the most part. The acting however is extraordinary. You must see this film for the outstanding, right on the mark performance of Ed Harris. His intensity as an actor never fails to amaze me. Equally brilliant is Anna Devere Smith as the mother. Her subtle and underplayed role is nothing short of heartbreaking. Rent or buy this film if you're interested in seeing great actors at the top of their game. I haven't mentioned Nicole Kidman because I am still not sure she was right for her role. Nevertheless she does a commendable job with a difficult part. It was obvious that turning the book into a film was a challenge. It almost makes it. If only they had found someone other than Hopkins for the lead. He's a fantastic actor, but is never believable for a moment in this role."
3,Just a touch draggy...and a bit too vulgar for my taste,"Anthony Hopkins plays a man that is forced to deal with his past, and realize that no matter how much he wanted to hide it, he had to accept it, and move on! Enter Nicole Kidman, a 30-something year old woman, who herself has to deal with her past, a past that is riddled with pain and suffering. The world that these people live in is very separate, but in the course of the film, they suddenly collide.Overall, the film was prety good, but in my opinion, the content was a bit over the top in vulgarity. Some of it was very unecessary...and very unwanted...yes it was rated R, but it has been a long time since I have heard the ""f"" word spoken more than ten times in a row within a 2 minute span...utterly embrassing in my book.All actors involved in this project did a great job with the material. Very dark drama indeed."
4,Human stain...,"Very thought provoking.It is about a man leaving his family (and color) to start a new life. For some reason he only falls for white women. Supposedly, he is so light that no one else can tell he is black. He only sneaks around to see his family.It is a strange movie but still thought provoking and deep."
2,The Human Stain,"A professor notes that, five weeks into the semester, two students have never appeared in his class. He asks if they are spooks, as in ghosts. But they happen to be black, so this professor (Anthony Hopkins) is sacked. You lost me that quickly. There is no credibility in this premise.Furthermore, he happens to be a black man masquerading as a Jew, and he later falls into an affair with Nicole Kidman, who is a poor young janitor illiterate. Or so I've read in a review somewhere.Which boundaries are stronger? Old and young? Rich and poor? Educated and uneducated? Black and white? People who watch this movie and Michael LaRocca?Yep. I gave up in 10 short minutes. This is too heavy-handed, obvious, Hollywood, blunt force trauma. Give them a good cause, and a novel by Philip Roth, and they can ruin it in a hurry. Damn."
1,This dvd is defective!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,"""The Human Stain"" was recommended to me by a friend from Atlanta Georgia. When I was scanning amazon's web for dvds, I was so happy to see that they had this dvd. When I inserted the dvd in my player, I received a message saying please eject, not for this area. I was so dissappointed,and trying to get credit is like trying to pass a congressional act. I will never order anything through amazon.com again and have advised all my family and friends of my experience.The Human Stain"
5,The Human Stain,This is an excellent movie that speaks to a problem that we often have as human beings--- an inability to accept who we are and where we came from and the consequences of those decisions and choices that we make as a result.
2,"No, No, No!","***SPOILER ALERT!***Anthony Hopkins, with his distinctive Welsh accent, plays a black man(!) posing as a Jew (huh?). I guess he developed that Welsh accent as he got older, because it was totally missing in his younger years. Then there's the exquisitely beautiful Nicole Kidman, who does her best to look plain and bedraggled. Both premises are essential to buying into the movie. Both premises are also utterly unbelieveable. Hopkins and Kidman are superb actors, but I could not suspend my disbelief. There is simply NO WAY to believe that Hopkins is even the lightest-skinned black person ever to walk the earth; nor can Kidman hide her radiant beauty behind a frumpy look. No, no, no!"
3,Intriguing but disjointed,"This story explores two very different characters from opposite backgrounds, both of whom are estranged from their families and suffer terrible losses before finding a degree of contentment with each other. The Anthony Hopkins character is very intriguing: a man who has reinvented his identity, only to endure the poetic irony of persecution for being who he is not. The other characters are more one-dimensional and don't quite balance out the story; I wonder whether the book on which this is based is more nuanced. Despite a good cast, good production values, and some strong scenes, the film feels like a jumble of unrelated episodes that never really meld. Still, I found it fairly thought-provoking and reasonably engrossing."
2,Disjointed and quick transitions,"After trying to do several of the sessions, I became frustrated and disappointed especially after the reviews I had read before ordering. The transitions between the exercises were quick and disjointed making it hard to follow. My husband also found it difficult AND boring because the transitions were so quick. Just when we were doing the stretches, off they would go to another position. I returned it."
1,"Zero stars: not as pictured, broken, and shoddy.","This item looked nice enough, though the price was perhaps too good to be true-- ordered it, and the one I got was nothing like this (black box, not a silver rounded thing) A piece of plastic was floating around loose in the case, and the contacts which are supposed to charge the battery are loose and crooked. I don't trust it to charge my batteries, so now I probably have to pay to have it shipped back. Very sad, but now I've learned my lesson."
5,Smokin',"This cd featuring Paul Cotton on lead vocals and other musicians like Steve Lukather,Michael Landau,Christopher Cross Ect,is an absolute must for any Lukather/Toto fan.It features excellent tracks such as From Across A Crowded Room,Jamaican Rain.The sound quality is supurb and Paul's voice flows like water. A rare piece of work indeed worth more credit than it ever recieved.Two thumbs up!!!"
5,Poco,"Grew up listening to Poco.. Paul Cotton, or ""King Cotton"", as George Harrison called him, was a big part of that group. His solo stuff is even better. Highly recommend his stuff. Wish he had more albums."
4,An interesting perspective,"As with Shaara's previous books, 'To The Last Man' brings the readers into the battles through the eyes of its characters. Ienjoyed this book and the interesting perspectives from the different characters. However, this is a historical work of fiction. Even though, the characters are based on in depth research and existing letters and family accounts, it is still the author's views and interpretations expressed in the book.I have read a couple of non-fiction books on the war and still found this book to be very good. I enjoyed the first part of the book that deals with the Lafayette Escardille, and the Red Baron. Shaara spends a good amount of time with the Red Baron, but I would have liked more on Ludendrof.I do recommend this book, it opens the readers eyes to a war that seems to have been forgotten, yet changed the way war was waged. It was a time when the romance of war was shattered by the misery and efficiency of how battles were fought."
4,Mick,A very interesting book I know so much about WW1 after reading this but its tough reading in places due to all the detail he provides. I would still recommend though.
2,A Disappointment,"Those with no knowledge of World War One might learn from this book. I found it to be basically a (partial) textbook about the war in which Mr. Shaara had inserted either fictional thoughts for real figures or created fictional characters to flesh out the story. I didn't find the characters believable at all, and much of the time I felt that Mr. Shaara was ""talking down"" to his readers. If I want to read about dates and actions, there are a great number of very well written non-fiction books available on the subject. In fiction, I look for more. I was very disappointed."
4,review of To The Last Man,This is a very well done historical fictional story. The author did a very good job using real people to build the story around.
4,great read,"not many books on ww1 and the people that faught. great story of th men in the trenches, the leadership, and then the flying aspect of the war."
5,The book to end all wars,World War one comes to life. I was exhausted marching with the marines from one battle to the next. I am still doing loops with the Amercan flyers. I still don't see how Pershing kupt his cool dealing with all the political infighting among the allies.
4,excellent,"Reading Shaara is such a great way to learn history. I picked up ""To the Last Man"" specifically because i felt I didn't know enough about World War I and what an entertaining way to learn. Highly recommendend."
4,Good effort on overlooked subject,I am a big fan of historical fiction and have always enjoyed the books written by Jeff Shaara. If you are familiar with his style you will not be surprised to find the story unfolding through the eyes of select individuals all of whom bring a slightly different perspective to the conflict. If you are new to Jeff Shaara I believe you will find his style very approachable and enjoyable. This is no great departure from other books written by Shaara but resonates with the same depth as his other books. I am a big history buff but admittedly have not studied World War I in detail and this was a great way to learn something and enjoy a good book at the same time.
3,Last Man is a little too much novel -- not enough strategy,"I am a great fan of Shaara's books and found the books about the wars I knew less well (the Revolution and the Mexican War) incredibly instructive and interesting. I found the blend of history, strategy and humanity irresistible. I was hoping that ""To the Last Man"" would be equally great. Unfortunately, I saw this book as a real departure in form. It was much more of a novel and less of an exploration of strategy and big picture analysis. I felt lost in the trenches. I think this was part of his objective; but it worked too well. I'd rank this book as good, but not worth the page length. Its only for real fans who are already established as fans -- not a good first book for reading Shaara."
4,A Terrific Book,"WW I is one of the least known events in our history, and Jeff Shaara really fills us in on it in a very, very interesting way.Today when we hear of 3 or 9 Americans being killed in Iraq, we are troubled. In World War I, thousands were killed on a daily basis during huge land battles but it wasn't on TV.Shaara's book is history in a novel format, and he does it superbly."
5,Page Turning Narative,Presents the horror and heroism of WWI. Brilliant writing makes this hefty volume go quickly. At times I was astonished by how this story puts current events in perspective. At times I was unable to keep tears from my eyes.
2,Dissapointing Effort,"Uneven effort by Shaara on this one. Starts well, but the section on the pilots really drags. Not compelling. This takes up half the book.I almost didn't finish it, but glad I did. The latter parts about the Doughboys advance against the Hun were well done in true Shaara style. Even his plot about Pershing and the high commenad was fairly engaging.My recommendation: Borrow it, don't buy it."
5,Excellent. A history teacher's review.,"Shaara's writing just continues to improve as far as I'm concerned. Like many people, I was led to Jeff Shaara by way of his father's book ""The Killer Angels."" While he has never achieved that level of mastery, this is a very strong book - at times poignant, at times repugnant and always interesting.Shaara's opening is strong and serves as a tremendous introduction to the vast devestation and inhumanity of the war. He focuses about half of the book on the new world of air power and the other half on an average foot soldier in the war. Pershing and other generals are thrown in from time to time to give the reader a wider view of the war. Those are essential as a plot device, but are not nearly as interesting as his portrayal of the fighting.I give this one an enthusiastic grade of A."
4,Very Good Reading,"I enjoyed this book. Shaara gave personalities and humanity to people who, to me, were merely names in history books. Black Jack Pershing, the Red Baron, George Patton, Eddie Rickenbacker, and Billy Mitchell are all here and I now have a better understanding of who they were and what they did. I also learned how the armistice which ""ended"" the first world war was actually part of the circumstances which led to the second world war. Shaara provides vivid descriptions of early aviation and trench warfare. If you like history and human drama then this book is well worth reading."
5,Superb fictional history,"WWI was the bloodiest war to date and a harbinger of things to come. For most people, WWI is remote and incomprehensible, its origions linked to imperial expansion and monarchies. It is difficult, if not impossible, for modern people to relate to such an environment.Through the fictional narrative of several real people, both major and minor players in the actual event, Jeff Shaara does a wonderful job of explaining the era, the causes of an idiotic war, the naivete of the people doing the actual fighting and dying and the corruption of the European leaders who couldn't stop the monster their own stupidity created.For anyone trying to grasp early 20th Century history, this is a must read. For those familiar with the period, it is a masterful recounting of the era through the pen of a master of historical fiction.Jerry"
2,Save your money,"Let's quantisize..1 lb. of wheatgrass berries at health food store: $1.952 10x20 trays at garden shop: $3.50 or less1 bag of organic potting mix at garden shop: $2.50 (approx)_____7.45Fertilzer? Don't need it. Vitamins for initial growing are in the berry.Instructions: just surf the web.I'm not even sure if I need the soil, but I compost it so nothing goes to waste.Cheap(er) and the juice comes out great!I have 3 trays going all the time so my wife and I can juice each day with no pause."
3,"sufficient, but take care","It had been several years since I'd sprouted grass at home, so I thought a kit would be an easy way to get back into the swing of things. I'm glad I went ahead with the purchase, but not because the product is really any good. The instructions on the card were different from the method I had used in the past (and strongly contradicted at several points by the contents of the book that came with the kit, which I thought was odd) but I gave them a try for my first tray... and lost that batch. Go ahead and ignore the instruction card.It was nice to start with everything arriving together; it helped commit me to the project, but for the long term the kit really isn't necessary."
5,kansas rocks!!,"A great CD. I went to high school with these guys and their live performances are great. This EP is excellent, the song ""looper"" is great. If you like REM, you should buy this album because one of their main influences is REM."
5,American Directory of Writer's Guidelines,"I received this book in just a few days after I ordered it and it was in stellar condition. I haven't received anything from or through Amazon yet that wasn't in good condition, as stated in the advertisement of the product. One book I purchased came from an obvious heavy smoker, and when I opened the envelope, the smoke was overwhelming. After immediately airing out the book, I've had no problem with it. I love using Amazon because it saves me bundles of money I can spend on other things - like more products! Good job, Amazon, and all its sellers!"
5,Outstanding Book!!! Highly recommend!,"I really enjoyed Isles of View, and highly recommend it. The author uses beautiful descriptive language, and provides fascinating insight into the life of a deaf person and the formidable challenges of marriage between hearing and deaf."
5,BEAUTIFUL!!!,AWESOME SELLER!!!! SUPER FAST SIGNATURE!!!!!! THANK YOU FOR A SMOOOOTH TRANSACTION AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS SELLER TO ANYONE DUE TO THE PRODUCT EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED ON THE SIGHT AND THE COLORS IN THE BRAVES RUGS ARE VIBRANT ABND DETALIS ARE AWESOME
3,conair slicker brush,"Product would probably work fine on long-haired cats. It sems to be a little rough on our short haired cat. Brush works well, we just have to be careful about pressure."
2,you get what you pay for...,Just do yourself a big favor and spend a little more for a better product. The mute is too small to be effective.
5,My New Bible,"I'm a gun owner and a gun rights advocate. I'm very fair-minded, consequently I've always wondered if my interest in gun ownership led me to be biased against gun control advocacy (i.e. ""I like 'em, they don't. Therefore, they must be wrong.""). Now that I've read ""Armed"" I no longer have any doubts that I've made the right choice on this topic. I found myself getting very angry with the medical society and the media while reading this book.This is the fifth and best book on this topic I've read. I only wish that everyone in a position of power, from government to the media, would read it. If you buy it and read it, maybe they will!"
3,Duplicates a better book,This book is almost the same as The Great American Gun Debate by the same primary authors (Kleck and Kates). You probably don't need both (and I prefer The Great American Gun Debate).
5,You can't run from your past forever...,"Boeshaar has outdone herself in Precious Things. She flawlessly mixes the past with the present in a story that deals with tough issues such as Forgiveness, a Hidden Past, Rekindling Friendships, and of course, Romance!The twist at the end really threw me. A terrific read that you won't be able to put down until you finish!You HAVE to get this one!"
2,Came in a month late,"Funny thing, I got the product a month late and then complained about it so the company said they would give me some ridiculous percentage off on my next purchase. Wake up morons..... there won't be another purchase"
2,Bad choice,Very outdated and boring to sit through. Looks to be early 70's style and gives very dry blah narrative. Almost no actual scenes from the train.
3,Lots of info on stops,"I was interested to see the train, and views from the train. There should be a lot of beautiful terrain on this trip. This shows some of that, but focuses more on the stops the train makes. Interesting info on a number of Canadian cities and attractions... but not as much train as I had hoped for."
5,Exceptional Reference,This is an exceptional book covering passenger service during the post war period. Photos are great and the author is known for his detailed research. If you study the ACL this book is a must have for your library. Allen
5,Atlantic Coast Line Passenger Service : The Postwar Years,"A major work on the passenger trains and streamliners of the ACL.A wonderful mix of art,photos,and history on the ACL. Anyone whos an Atlantic Coast Line Railroad enthusiast will treasure this book!"
4,Track listing,This is one of those wonderful singles that has some lovely B-Sides1) Caught a Lite Sneeze2) This Old Man3) Hungarian Wedding Song4) Toodles Mr Jim
1,Destination? Trash Bin,"I am a huge Elizabeth Bevarly fan, but this was not her usual fare. This story was missing the humor and wit that is evident in every one of her stories. But, this was her very first book - something I didn't realize when I purchased it. A businessman, Silas, finds himself on a remote island in the Caribbean after his plane goes down. He meets (and within like 4 days) falls in love with Hester, a woman who also escaped the city life for an island lifestyle. The `romance' is superficial and uninteresting, and the characters - both the primary and secondary ones - are undeveloped. The book is bad. I would recommend sticking to modern Elizabeth Bevarly stories and staying out of her archives!"
4,Wonderfully reminiscent of John Hughes earlier work,"I absolutely loved this film. There were brilliant performances all round but best of all was Seth Green. He definitely lives up to the promising performances of his early career and will, without a doubt, go far. This is one film that should be a part of everyone's video collection. I thoroughly recommend it and those who have not seen it yet should get themselves to their nearest video store sharpish!"
5,This movie was unreal and the soundtrack is just as good.,"This movie is one of my favorites cause it goes back to the 80's kind of movies. This movie has the best soundtrack i have ever heard also, who ever blended the songs in the movie deserves to be in every movie. Plus jennifer Love Hewitt is in it, god damn she is hot."
4,"Great Movie, With scenes destined to become Classic.","Top Movie. This film is funny, smart and intelligent . It's great too that theres not too much sentimenality. Top birds in the film too. Jennifer love etc. This film rates with all the great comming of age flicks, Fast Times, Dazed and confuzed,Animal House etc."
4,Okay Flick,This movie is sort of slow and kind of immature. It is a great movie for a girls night in I would have to say. And you guys would all probally enjoy to sit around and droll over Jennifer and brag about that is how you acted in high school. Over all good movie for both sexes!
4,Surprisingly Entertaining,"I rented this movie thinking that it was just going to be another one of those stupid little teen flicks that nobody ever talks about after the week that it comes up. I WAS WRONG! I found this one of the funnier movies that I have seen in a long time. Even though it had some stupid parts, I really enjoyed this movie and I reccomend it."
4,VERY entertaining!,"This film could bring out the humor in just about anybody. I thought Jennifer Love Hewitt did an outstanding performance (considering that this is, so far, her only good movie). Seth Green was a riot! Special K was da bomb!"
3,Funny but no oscar.,"This movie was funny where it didn't mean to be. The guys were cute but, Jenifer Love Hewitt seriouosly bothers me. I thought Kenny was the only genuinely funny charecter [except the foriegn exchange student.]"
5,I LOVED this movie!,"I absolutley loved ""Can't Hardly Wait""! The entire movie was good, but the scenes that I really liked were between Kenny and Denise. I have seen it probably 10 times and ""can't hardly wait"" to buy the video."
5,A great movie about teenage life!,I thought that Jennifer Love Hewitt was great! She told all the guys how she felt! She doesn't want to strip her clothes off and do them! Women shouldn't be treated that way!
5,I loved this movie!Isaw it 3 times. It was so funny.,"This movie, about teens and thier problems, was great! It was funny and yet still had a story line to it! I also like the characters along with the actors! This movie is funny for the ages of 12-22 I think!"
5,Met and exceeded expectations,One of the most tragically underrated movies ever made.The bonus content is outstanding. Both of the commentaries as well as the reunion special are hilarious.
4,Pretty Good,"The movie was pretty good I liked it, probable because I like Jennifer Love Hewitt. I don't think I would have liked it nearly as much with so other actress, so if you like Jennifer Love Hewitt you will like the movie."
3,So-so BD transfer,"I expected a little more from this transfer to BD. I know it's an aging flick, thus a catalog title, but it's also from Sony. Sony has a history of hit & miss BD transfers of catalog titles so this was a gamble. I doubt something like this will see a re-release so if you're switching your library over to BD as I am, you may as well pick this up, it probably won't look much better in the future."
5,Stonking (and Tense),"This Is one of the best feelgood films i have seen in a long time. It was one of those films with the tense feeling all the way through. with the will they, wont they, moments all through out. if you liked ten things i hate about you, fast times at ridgemont high and films of a similar ilk then this is for you It is about a boy who has loved the same girl for 4 years. when she is finally single he makes a pact with himself to show his true feelings. Along with many other plot lines and a spectacular cast (especially Seth Green In his Best role to date) this is a must see movie. see it before it is too late."
5,Seth Green is Hot!!!!,"I think this movie is really good because all of the actors have different personalities, on and off the screen. They kind of counteract each other making the script even more explosive. Seth Green's really hilarious when he's talking all funny amd stuff, and he's really cute too."
2,A Stinker.,"Can't Hardly Wait starring Jennifer Love Hewitt leaves nothing to the imagination. Predictable romantic teen comedy, you know what the ending will entail and the acting is pretty lame. Seth Green is pretty good but doesn't he always play the doofus? Ethan Embry is soooooooooo annoying, he acts like a little lost puppy, you just feel sorry for this guy. I really wanted to like this film but it's pure silliness, don't waste your time people."
2,"""Can't Hardly Wait"" for What?","The graduation party is here! Let's all cheer and jump up with joy! If there was any kind of realism to this movie, the guy wouldn't have got the girl. Trust me. In ""Can't Hardly Wait,"" a doofus wannabe writer had a crush on the most popular girl in school and he prepared a love letter for her so she would be his. Oh Mandy (Jennifer Love Hewitt), since the quarterback on the football team dumped you, you're no longer with the 'in-crowd.' High school drama smells. You have the two friends who drifted apart and got in touch with their feelings in a bathroom. You have the nerd who tried to get back at the quarterback and have his dweeb friends hang out on the roof of the house. Oh yeah, Jenna Elfman is an 'angel' and tells Preston (doofus) that she kissed Charlie from ""Charles in Charge."" What an accomplishment. This movie is for dreamers. Don't sit through this one."
2,Funny but seriously immature.,"I love Seth Green, and Jennifer Love Hewitt in most movies because they are such fun but this movie was so pathetic. The only thing I really liked was when those two ""geeks"" were sitting on top of the roof and playing with their flashlights, when that other ""geek"" said that the stars were god's salt and he was waiting to eat us, the part where the one ""geek"" is singing that song on the stage (he's so drunk!) and that crazy girl with the scissors ""You're all sheep. BAAAHH!"". I love that part...But the movie isn't the funniest I have ever seen and I was seriously dissapointed. If you are going to make a comedy it should be stomach aching funny not ""heh heh heh"" funny. The entire bathroom part was boring, along with anything to do with that guy obsessed with Mandy. The ""geeks"" were just hilarious."
5,"Can,t hardly wait","I love this movie it is one of the greatest movies that i have ever seen. I have had the movie almost a year now and i get it out to watch quite often. NJennifer Love Hewitt is definitely what makes this movie so great. She is definitely the greatest actress and and she definitely has the sweetest voice i have ever heard. I have 15 of her videos plus 3 on dvd,s. And i also have all of her CD.S plus 1 single.And she is definitely the most beautiful woman in the world. So i guess that makes me a great big fan of hers Harry Webb"
1,BORING!!!!,"Can't Hardly Wait is a really awful film. I recommend you to go watch the movie, American Pie which is 1000000000000 times funnier than this junk. You'll thank me later, if you did. PG-13 teen movies just can't work."
3,"Jenifer Love Hewit, what more can you ask for?","Cute movie, and Jenifer Love Hewit has a smile that lights up the world. When I give 3 stars, it's a movie that I would actually own. I reserve 4 stars for movies that are exceptional, and 5 for movies that are all time greats."
5,The Best Movie Ever,Can't Hardly Wait is such a good portrayal of what happens gradutation night. I thank God that someone actually had the guts to make a movie about it. This movie is hilarious thanks to so many jokes from Special K (seth green) and romantic from Ethan Embry. If you want a movie that you can watch over and over again then this is it. I've seen it 49 times
4,"Not bad, but $90 is too much for a ""ditz"" movie!!","I love this movie, it's hilarious! The only thing is: Why anyone would pay 90 bucks for a dumb little video casette, I don't know."
2,Weak movie,"Out of all the highschool films from the last couple of years, this one is the worst. Jennifer Love Hewitt and the boy who is obsessed with her are the most uninteresting characters here. The best character was Seth Green, in the ultimate fly4awhiteguy role. The film was boring, boring, boring. How can it have a 4 1/2 star rating? See ""Clueless"" or ""Fast Times at Ridgmont High"" if you want to see a real high school movie. This film has too many cute people with too little talent."
2,THE 'ANIMAL HOUSE' FOR TEENAGERS OF THE 90s,"When teenagers party, boy do they party. This is probably one of the top 5 films in this genre with great performances from Ethan Embry formally known as Ethan Randall ) Jennifer Love Hewitt and the always awesomely watchable Oz man himself, Seth Green. With the party underway you can easily excuse the poor script because there is enough hilarity to keep even the most hardened party pooper rolling on the floor."
5,This movie is totally awesome,I loved this movie.Mostly becuase I love Seth Green in this movie .He is soooooooo Fine in this movie
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I love the characters, music, plot-everything! It is really funny, but heartfelt at time without being cheesy. It's just...GREAT!"
4,Get rid of the other review. 'Nuff said.,"This movie should not be considered the thinking man's movie, but rather the drinking man's movie. Jennifer Love Hewitt is gorgeous, and plays the role of the girl who lost, or never had, her four years in high school beautifully. All of the other characters went to your high school in one manner or another. Not a movie to recommend to the 'rents, but one of the best movies to see to get some of the hardest laughs with some buddies possible. (recommended ages 17-26)"
3,CAN'T HARDLY WAIT,"THIS MOVIE IS GREAT, SERIOUSLY... IT'S LIKE ONE OF THE ""GOOD"" TEEN/YOUNG ADULT MOVIES. EVERY CHARACTER IS PLAYED WELL AND THIS MOVIE HITS CLOSE TO HOME NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF KID YOU WERE BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL. CHECK IT OUT AND NEXT TIME YOU GET A ""PRETZEL"" GET IT WITHOUT THE ""SALT"" MAN- FOR BOTH OUR SAKES."
2,Skips,"This movie skipped in all the DVD players I tried. It also wouldn't work in my ps3 or computer. It's fine because I didn't pay much for it, but I would have liked a working product... As I really wanted to watch this movie."
4,Lighthearted 90's Say Anything,"Loved it, being in my latter 20's I did not plan to like (or even watch) the latest farwell to high school flick, but it was on our cable so... All the different stories told at the FINAL party where everyone is together is so on. I reminded me of MY last big high school party. PS. The soundtrack is awesome too."
5,This is a great movie for the under twenty crowd.,"Jennifer Love Hewitt and Ethan Embry are great in the movie. While the movie may be a little confusing at times that seems to be the idea. The supporting cast is also great. With a lot of well knows playing small parts. Seth Green also brings his insane personality to the film giving it a kind of edge. So if your under twenty, you have to see this movie, because you will love it."
5,This is my alltime favorite movie!!,"It is extremely funny, yet at the same time it is also a good love story, and all of the actors are so good! I strongly suggest this movie!! ( Today I watched it at least6 times and it is still funny!"
3,a feel good party movie,"this one you can stand if your paying attention to the leads. the extras nearly trash this one. Seth Green is the scene chewer as Kenny Fisher, the kid whos a wannabe gangsta and his scenes are the highlights. Ethan Embry is wonderful, Lauren Ambrose is bitchy but thats sorta hot, Jennifer Love Hewitt is a bore sometimes but shes easily good, Charlie Korsmo as the geek is hilarious when he stands up and dances and sings to Guns and Roses Paradise City and Peter Facinelli is the mbodiment of all jocks. the party scene is nice but some extras like the annoying Melissa Joan Hart, Jerry O'Connell, Jenna Elfman and all the other jocks nearly burn this one into the ashpahlt.favorite lineKenny Fisher(Seth Green)- are you crying.oh no baby please!, you are far to fine to look so sad."
3,Thought I couldn't hardly wait to see it...now I wish I had,"I was also a graduate of the class of 1998, so I thought that I would check this movie out and see if it was something that I could really look back on in the future. NOPE! There is nothing in this movie really about how things were in those 12 years of school that I could watch this when I'm 45, and go, ""Oh, yeah, I remember that!"". It's just a bunch of drunk teens trying to deal with issues that should really mean nothing at all to viewers of this movie. My mistake was I bought the video before renting it. Take my advice, if you want to get an idea for yourself of what the movie is like, RENT IT FIRST. Better to spend a few bucks than about 10 or 15. I do give it the 3 stars because I have to admit that there were some funny scenes, and a select few situations that I could relate to. Other than that it was rather goofy and almost a waste of time."
1,Not worth the price for.,The books contains not only errors but brings no new information about security on Solaris 9 and procedures. It simple does not show you any news besides man pages and Sun .pdf books. You must find all information on to-do's other place.If you are looking for SC300 course and Security Cert on Solaris 9 this will disappoint you.
1,Are you Kidding me. ?,I dont usually take the time to write reviews. This product does NOT even deserve 1 star. The older version was ok but these Morons at Sage software must be smoking weed all day. There are problems and stupidity to many to mention. I seriously hope that someone comes out with a new database management tool. I went back to my OLD version from 2004 whaic is superior to the new one in many ways.My recomendation. Deloiver Pizza before you depend on act.
2,Dissapointed in Florida,"The title would lead one to believe that there is actually an audio portion to this book. What there is, however, are 74 pages that are of absolutely no use because there is no tape or CD included. For those of us who do not speak Spanish and have children trying to learn it this book is a waste of money."
1,Misleading Title,I also purchased this workbook expecting a CD. There isn't even any reference to a CD or how to access any audio material in the workbook ?? The audio activities of the workbook are useless.
2,Less than adequate,"Having been to many of the places covered in this book, I was saddened to note that the writers appear to have not done their homework. The information is the sort that you could obtain by writing to the countrys Embassys. The book also appears to be aimed at the High End Market. The main reason for living in another country when you retire is to make your retirement income get ""more bang for the buck."" All the authors dialog about $700 to $1,900/month rents made me wonder what their perspective on retirement haven's is. Their internet resource guide was off and needs to be updated. Buy this book for general information purposes only."
1,Out of Touch,"Having lived and visited many of the the countries reviewed, I was amazed at how little effort went into checking the reality of the cost of living. Also I found a huge lack of enthusiasum about most countries, sad if these are the best retirement havens. Mexico and France seem to be the only countries were some research was done. I thought this book would help with my decision, on which country in europe to retire. I favor Italy. I found I already knew more than this book had to offer and had more realistic information regarding living costs."
3,"Good for General ""Wishing"" or to start planning","This guide has general tips and contacts for what are the top overseas retirement destinations for Americans. For each country there are suggested locations and real estate options that would be of use to retirees. Locations that have substantial US/UK populations are also noted, for the not-quite-so adventurous. As stated above, this work is most useful for someone who's maybe thinking about living overseas, and wants to look at the pro's and cons. OR, convincing your ""Significant Other"" that yes you can actually live at that great vacation spot on Crete....Anyone who's already deep into planning for such a move, or has spent considerable time overseas would probably already know most of the information provided here."
2,Not much to go on,"While this book provided some general information about lifestyle and local culture, it lacked any serious details required by someone looking to retire abroad. In particular the tax information was at best irrelevant and at worst incorrect and misleading. Many of the Additional Resources and Useful Websites are out of date.Overall this book provides a useful starting point for those considering retirement abroad, but lacks sufficient detail to make it a truly useful resource."
1,Failed Twice,New cartridge was installed and I immediately found ink smudges on my pages. Company replaced cartridge during the first week and new cartridge failed again. I give up. Will purchase cartridge from a different firm.
1,Filled printer interior with toner!,"I installed this cartridge in my older HP 4+, hit print for a 60 page document and left the room. The document pages printed out gray. When I open the toner door - there was toner all over the place! I ended up tossing printer, cartridge and all the paper left in the drawer. I rate this zero stars."
2,Toner Cartridge Review,"Toner cartridge below standard. Ink remains on roller which ends up printing shadows on copies. Toner goes on too thick and smudges. This cartridge was a good price, but with shipping costs, it would have been worth it to have paid a little more and gotten better quality. Overall, definitely wouldn't try this vendor again."
1,poor quality,"I ordered 2 of these and they both worked fine for about a month or so, then they started leaving streaks all over the pagesnow the printouts are almost illegible."
5,Great quality and great price,"I was very happy with this product. The quality of the toner is identical to what I would have expected from HP OEM toner cartridges, but at a fraction of the price."
1,Put your money tword a genuine print cartridge,"Bought 2 of these. Both immediately came up with the ""toner low"" error message. The 1st one printed 5 pages, then failed totally. The company said they would refund the item cost and return shipping costs. But first I'd have to pay to ship them. Then I'd be crossing my fingers they received the returned items and followed through. I'm simply recycling them (return for recycle costs are covered) and buying a genuine HP cartridge. These things are junk...you get what you pay for."
1,Don't buy it,"Do not buy this toner. The first few pages printed nicely. But then smudges started appearing in the white areas, as if words from one page were bleeding onto the next page. There were even smudges on the back of the page. And they kept getting darker with each page I printed. Who knows how much toner was wasted just on the smudges. I have already disposed of it."
2,More of a pink than peach.,"I had purchased this product to use on some cupcakes I was making for my grandparent's 60th wedding anniversary. The color on the food coloring is what I was going for- a creamy peach with brownish undertones. What I got using this was pink (More like the swatch next to the bottle, only much brighter) I wanted to cry after having made a huge batch of cream cheese frosting pink, but was able to correct it a more acceptable peach by adding yellow food coloring."
3,Nose army landmine? Smell sign!,"Every now and again a movie comes along which throws out the rules of movie making and reminds us that anything is possible. ""Schizopolis"" did this for me last year, as did Sogo Ishi's ""Angel Dust,"" the Brothers Quay's ""Institute Benjamenta,"" and Philip Ridley's ""The Passion of Darkly Noon"". A wonderful movie."
2,"Soderbergh's best, which isn't saying much...","I do like parts of this film, which is unusual, as I feel Soderbergh is one of the most overrated filmmakers working today. Here this film has a bit of a free form feel, and it works well in spots, but in others it just falls flat. Soderbergh is not a particularly good actor, and he doesn't have much screen presence. Casting himself was a mistake. Many of Soderbergh's films are remakes (Solaris, Traffic, Ocean's 11), and not very good ones at that. Here he tries to emulate Python and Bunuel, and he has some success, but overall the film is a mess, and a lot of its jokes don't quite cut it."
4,feverish spontaneity,A refreshing blend of satire and surrealism that showcases a crazy cast having rather bizarre adventures.
2,This is NOT a good movie.,"While I certainly can't argue that this movie isn't unique or surreal, those qualities alone do not redeem this film. Definitely worth renting twice (the first time you are just trying to figure out what the hell is going on), but it is not worth owning. In fact, after the second viewing you come to the conclusion that one viewing and the total confusion it invokes would probably have been better than watching it the second time."
2,SODERBERGH GOES NUTS,"Put Monty Python, Mad Magazine and Kafka in a blender, add celluloid and you'll get Stephen Soderbergh's comedy SCHIZOPOLIS (Criterion).This paranoid pastiche of skits, visual puns and verbal riffs has no story but attempts nothing less than making sense of reality via dentistry, doublespeak and corporate espionage.Besides directing and starring in a dual role, Soderbergh wrote the screenplay, edited the film and interviews himself on the commentary track. He says:""If you don't understand this film, it's your fault and not ours.""No, Stephen, it's your fault."
3,Not a successful book,"I had read the author's previous book ""The 100 Simple Secrets of Happy People"" which I found to offer practical advice, and it was also fun and interesting to read. I had similar expectations for ""The 100 Simple Secrets of Successful People"" which has the same format of providing a research finding along with advice and an example. The 100 secrets of the ""Successful People"" book do not seem as practical and concrete as the secrets in the ""Happy People"" book. Also, I felt like the examples often did not directly relate to the research finding. I would read an example and find myself more perplexed than enlightened, wondering how it was supposed to illustrate the current ""secret"". Overall, the book provides numerous research findings that could contribute to success (and provides a reference to the published research), but the reading is tedious--not a successful book."
2,Good Bathroom Reading,"The key to understanding this book is right in the title, ""simple secrets"". There is nothing complicated or deep about any of the 100 short stories, complete with a moral and lesson of the day. Most of the ""secrets"" seemed a little forced and within the 100 there was a bit of redundancy.This book also focused about 75% of it's secrets and stories on work/business related experiences. The lack of variety made this seem more like a ""how to do better at your job book"". Really one-dimensional.I was dissapointed, but kept the book...the short stroies are trite but offer some tiny gems of western culture wisdom. Nothing really new, but a good 5 minute read."
1,Lifeless and trivial,"These are indeed simple ideas--and hardly secrets. If you have never thought about success in your own life, perhaps you may get something out of this book. But if seeking success and achievement is a part of your life this book will be nothing but dull for you.The stories are not at all inspirational since they lack any real meat. They were more like a set of facts which may have sometimes been derived from a really good story, but left me thinking ""So what?"". The stories are too simple.The ""science"" consists of a quick statistic. E.g., ""The productivity of employees who score high in dedication to their career is 33 percent less likely to be affected by the quality of their managers than is the production of low-dedicated employees.""So, in short, the points are trivial, the stories don't work, and the so-called science is presented in a way that is generally useless. Very simplistic."
3,Concise common and practical tips for Happiness,"This paperback is a very quick refresher. Perfect for subway rides or long commutes. It reflects on very easy steps we can all take to live happier less stressful lives. Honestly I think most of these items we all know about, but we get distracted by everyday life to put them in practice. This is almost a cheat sheet reminder to remember. Like this author and his other books too. Very similar to Carlson's Don't Sweat The series..."
3,I agree with Tom,"The original tribebook for Children of Gaia was very well done. This one has horrible. The original tribebook made you want to play a Child; this one drives you away from it. As Tom says, the dialogue was lame and the Children just seem like a bunch of slackers. The back of the book section, with new gifts, feats, etc. has very little of worth to add.If you don't have the previous book, then sure, get it. Otherwise, avoid."
5,GOT HOSCLAW????,I have an older hosclaw boat trailer and these shocks fit perfect and work perfect.Absolutely worth the money to have new working shocks on the boat trailer.
4,Fits my Holsclaw trailer,"I bought these shocks to replace the ones on a 1969 Holsclaw boat trailer with coil springs. They fit perfectly and thankfully they came with two mounting bolts. Unfortunately there was only one spacer and nut in the mounting kit for each shock. It would be nice if Monroe packed two nuts and spacers in each, but I guess my trailer is odd in what is needed to mount the shocks. I would have given them 5 stars if I hadn't had to buy an extra nut and find a spacer substitute.I have always had good fortune with Monroes and I expect this to be no different. The old shocks were Monroes and they had been submersed in salt water often and they held up well.Amazons price was the best and the shipping fast."
3,Hot time? More like lukewarm,"If you like ""Disney's"" odd-ball take on Hades, you injoy thisweird look at mythical Greek threw the eyes of Hades/Pluto, the King of the Underworld. Hades had got a new stuff stuff from the BOOK-OF-THE-MONTH guy--the BIG-FAT-BOOK-OF-GREEK-MYTH--and discover that Zues is fixing things--he decides on getting a ghost to help write the truth. It's not as funny as book 2, but it's pretty good. Roman numbers replaces the usually normal numbers in the book."
3,Where's Wallace?,"Most of them are for use in very thick material, and there are a lot of rubber plugs for which I have no use.However, since you can't get rubber grommets anymore, this is as good as it gets. Some of them are useful.Maybe someday the Chinese will develope the technology to make rubber products. In the meantime, grab anything you can find."
5,ABCs of Vocal Harmony - Finally! - Thank you!,"""Your Vocal Harmony Course is great! It's fun and encouraging too. For the first time we have something other than just a book for the kids. Having both male and female voice to listen to and match makes all the difference ... and filling in the missing notes of intervals and chords and getting immediate feedback is just what we need. Thanks."" Jayne Campbell - Westlake - Harvard School"
3,Quality was okay...just too small for my head.,"I received the hat quickly, and the quality was fine except for the fit. I must have a big head since it was too small adjusted to the maximum size."
2,Flap Hat,"The flap hat was too small for one size fits all, it did not fit. I purchased and style of flap hat at the same time and it fits fine."
3,"If you like Max & Ruby DVD's, this one's for you!","My 2 yr old loves Max and Ruby bunnies. I like this Collection, but did not like the book that is included. The DVD's are very good. I would have preferred 3 DVD's, instead of the book."
5,Boston Legal,I love this show and can not stop watching the DVDs. If you love intelligent yet quirky comedy you will love this show. If you're already a fan of Boston Legal then this set of DVD's is a must.I live in Australia and was so pleased that the delivery time was fast and shipping cost was really quite reasonable.
4,Boston Legal - Seasons 1-3,"This is a great value for the $$$'s. We laughed so hard as we watched this funny and entertaining comedy/drama that touches on nearly every topic making headlines today. The acting is superb and the writing is amazing. The only thing that bothered us as we watched was that some of the disks stall and must be ejected and re-played before you can proceed. This only affected one or two episodes each season, but was still annoying since it was a brand new boxed set."
3,Written for a younger audience,"I am extrememly curious about the deaths of the Romanov's, but this book failed to satisfy my intrigue. It was written in a first person point of view. And the Anastasia in this book didn't know much about what was going on in the world of her father or mother. She was kept guessing most of the time. I can see the literary tragedy of the poor girl being blindsided, but it leaves the reader in the dark as well. It would be a great read for someone younger, but I was looking for a book with more substance and detail."
4,20th Century Fox-Tainted,"This book was a nice, laid-back read that gently informed one about what the Imperial Family was going through before and during WWI. However, I was very annoyed to see that a few things that had been made up and stated in the 20th Century Fox animated movie 'Anastasia' were re-hashed in this book. Reading about the author at the end of the book, you see that Carolyn Meyer had indeed seen that movie and loved it. It was incredibly annoying to see the same fabricated material twice. It's taking fiction a little too far; children reading this book and seeing the movie would think that because both books mention a possible trip to Paris with Anastasia's grandmother and a music box, those things really occured/existed. Books should influence movies, not vice versa."
4,Anastasia Story,I find it a shame that the last months of any of the royal diaries princesses are always the most interesting and sad. That being said I still like the series because I don't know everything about every princess except this one. Anastasia story is very familiar to me as I have read everything I can get my hands on about the Romanov. Out of the the four girls of Nicholas and Alexandria Anastasia was the most lovable for having a great sense of humor and being artistic.This book captures a little of Anastasia's life but I would encourage those who are interested in her history to read other books because I believe that many other book grab the essence of Anastasia better.
5,Another interesting Royal Diaries novel,"""Anastasia: The Last Grand Duchess"" was a great book that gave a much more realistic version of this young girl's life than the movies made about her!12-year-old Anastasia has a wonderful time with her family, playing with her younger brother and father, reading her sisters' diaries, and visiting relatives. However, after her 13th birthday, her carefree life begins to change, when war breaks out with Russia. Continuing until she is almost 17, you will be amazed at the changes, generally not for the better, that take place in this teenager's life.I really learned a lot about Anastasia, who lived not very long ago. The only thing I'd say against this book was that some years of her life were covered pretty briefly, but other than that, this first funny, and then serious novel was a great read! I'd definitely recommend it for ages 11 and up - I think this exciting book would appeal to a wide audience!"
4,GREAT BOOK about the LAST GRAND DUCHESS,"When I bought this book, it looked so interesting. This was my first contact with the country of Russia. Anastaia told about how to find her sisters diaries and all fun things to do. I could actually picture all the beautiful places Anastaia went to. But, when I came to the end, I learned about what happened to her family. At the site of the words that said Anastaia and her family were DEAD, I would have wept. When it said how they died, I wanted to stop reading. But, there was a myth saying she survied her family's death and still alive. And guess what, I BELIEVE!! So, read this book and find out for yourself."
5,A five star must read!,"Anastasia's Diary is a great book! Anastasia was the last Grand Dutches of Russia. This Diary tells the life of Anastasia from January 3, 1914 to May 6, 1918. These four years of her life are very exiting! Once, her father went to war and was gone on and off for 3 years! Anastasia even finds her sister's diaries and writes what her sister's had been writing like their secrets and stuff! This book is too exiting not to read!"
2,Terribly Boring!,This book wasn't very good. It was quite boring up until the part when they were taken away from their palace's. It was the same thing day after day after day after day. This was not a good book.
4,It was a fun way to look at history!!,"Anastasia gave me an insight about how people might have thought back then. When I read this book, suddenly, Anastasia isn't just someone in history, but someone who had feelings, and thought, and opinions. It was truly a great experience to read this book. I learned about history and still enjoyed the book at the same time."
5,Wonderful Book!!,"I love this book, when I was reading it I couldnt put it down for anything, even for school. I love History and I love studying the Romanovs especially the two younger Grand Duchesses Marie and Anastasia. This is a very special book and I recommend that people who love history to read it."
4,Anastasia: The Last Grand Duchess,"The book is about Anastasia live. At the beginning of the book everthing is going well. But on the first of August 1914 there father anoust that they were going to war with the Germans.At first they were a lot of battles. Then as time went on they startded to lose more and more battles. People of Russia were starting to get very angry at the Tsar so he had no choice but to give up his Tsar. But family still had to be pertected. Sothey moved to small village of Inglad. But one night the guards told them to go down stairs in a room. And a few min. later men came into the room and started shooting. So the royal family was killed.The charcters in this book are the roal family. Alexandra,Tsar,Olga,Tatiana,Maria,Anastasia and Alexei.Over all i think the book was great .But it was Anastasia dairy which a got to read her thougts.And I would read it again if I'd had the chance."
5,An Interesting book,Anastasia: The Last Grand Duchess is a really good book. Anastasia is the 4th Daughter of Tsar Nicholas II & Tsaritsa Alexandra.Anastasia has four other sibling. In this book it explains her life and the many places where they lived. It's really interesting learning about their big family. Anastasia is about 13 when she writes in this diary and is 17 when it ends. Young Pre Teen girls would like this book. I think it's an interesting book especially in the end. Read this book and you'll find out about how this Anastasia and her family's life ended. It's a must read!!
5,A door to History,"Anastasia is my door to history. I saw the diseny movie when it came out and it spurred my intrest in Russia for a while. Then, that facination died as I turned 12. When I was 15 I picked up this book, remembering the movie. Although the true ending to Anastasia broke my heart, it again fueled my desire for knowledge. If you give your child this book to read you may find them developing a passionate interest in History, a passion that may last all their life."
4,A Grand Duchess to the end.,Anastasia was the youngest of the imperiol romanov children.But alot of times in the book they called her a princess but teqniqually she was an imperiol grand duchess with was higher than a mere eoropeon princess.But no biggie.That is why i only gave it 4 stars.But other wise it was good.
3,Pretty good,"For some reason, this book didn't suit me. I suppose I should reread it, but i didn't like it as much as the other stories. Good effort!"
4,I thought this Royal Diaries book was pretty good.,"I have always been interested in the Romanovs because I live in Russia, and Tsarkoe Selo is just an hour from my house. But this book was good but I thought it could have been written better. It doesn't have enough detail about the Romanovs' privates lives, and it mostly deals with the characters and that's it. I am a Russian, and my cousin in Chicago, USA, sent me this book to read.I thought the very ending was touching but heartbreaking. But the the whole book needed some more details about Anastasia's life."
2,An insufficient read,this book I think is more suited for a younger reading audience.I think that there is insufficient factual facts submitted in the read.
4,The true story...,"We have all seen the movies about Anastasia , the disney one , whch was extremely fictional , makes this books something you want to read. The disney movie refused to day how they really died, but this book told the truth. The only part I didn't like was that they didn't mention Rasputin enough."
3,Ok,This book was a little boring in my opinion. This book is basicly about how Anastasia went from a wealthy person to a poor and deperssed person. The book didn't have good enough discription. It also lacked adventure. Maybe her life wasn't that exciting but I think the author could have done a little bit better in this book. The thing I did like about it was that had some good history info in it.
3,Anastasia - A dry and dull read,"This is not the best.It is dry and dull.This book written by Caroline Myer is about a silly little girl who wants to go skating and having picnics.It is SOOOOOOO boring.I couldn't even finish it because of the same boring and tedious entries Anastasia put in her diary every-day.Anastasia, is about the last royal family in the Russian Dynasty.This book is about the holidays they have,the celabrations they celabrate and the luxuries they enjoy.At the end the Tsar of Russia[Anastasia's father]starts a war and the family are doomed.This book is also deppressing.Even though i wasn't very strong with the characters in this book,i still got very upset.This book is not at all the best.It's one of the boring ones."
2,Not that good,"I do not think this book is as good as I thought it would be. It is a very boring diary and definitely the Marie Antoinette book is better.I do not like the book about Cleopatra much either.The book on Anastasia just talks about when she goes to picnics and other palaces and when she went on yatchs. Since I heard so many good reviews on this book, I thought on buying this book, but it turnes out it is'nt that good. I cannot believe people actually like this book even. Anastasia led a boring life and she recorded it in her boring diary."
2,Anastasia Romanov,"This book gets only exciting at the end when the Romanovs get arrested. 'till then, Anastasia led a boring life. I do not recommend this book to anyone, and do not be fooled by the other reviewers, this book is definitely not good. ( But gets slightly better at the end)"
2,"Great ideas, poor instructions","The purses in this book are all variations on a set of basic patterns. The color pictures are great and show a lot of great ideas. The text is written in an entertaining and humorous style that is fun to read. Where this book starts to fall apart is when you go to actually make one of these purses. Vague instructions and errors abound. One one page, the instructions list the size of one pattern piece as different than what the pattern piece is drawn for. The author glosses over how to insert anything but a fabric handle. There are no instructions on how to put in a magnetic clasp or bag feet. And the measly section on how to put in a zippered pocket was so vague that I had to rip out the pocket three times. I finally went to another source to get clear instructions. The book also doesn't give guidance on when to add the extras. Should trim go on before sewing the lining together? Handsewn on afterwards? If the author knows, she's not tellling."
5,BEST Beginner to Expert Hangbag book ...,This book is the best handbag design book I have found to date. It provides 7 designs (with patterns and instructions) with various alternate bags based on these designs. The gallery of other designer bags is awesome (even a stain glass bag!) and it also gives tips for embellishing pre-purchased bags.This book is a definite winner!
1,disappointed,"I start sewing a year ago and I started with bags. So this book really appeal to me. Let me say that I was really disappointed when it arrives from amazon. Actually I didn't even bother to keep it and return it a couple of days later. They're better books on the subject (Make Your Own Handbags)There's seven different patterns in this book and a few variations on each pattern and embellished bags. For my taste, the bags didn't look great and some of the were overdone (too embellished)You can have a look at some of them if you google the book on google books."
2,NOT a book for beginners.,"I have been making clothes for about 47 years so am quite experienced and therefore feel qualified to give an opinion.This book has some great ideas, but the ""instructions"" and ""patterns"" are dire. For beginners attempting to make one of these bags could be an absolute nightmare. What a shame that proper instructions for cutting a pattern are not included. I see that thanks are given to a host of advisors, even a technical consultant...I wonder how much time she actually devoted to the so-called ""technical consulting"", or anything else for that matter.Suffice to say, I think a beginner should stick to decorating a purchased bag, or getting professional help if attempting to make a bag from scratch, especially any designs from this book!"
2,handmade handbags,I was not too thrilled by this book. It has some good basic ideas and a few embellishmet ideas. But most were just not my cup of tea.
4,Well worth buying!,"I first got this book out of my local library and was very impressed with the majority of the patterns (not all but then that's to be expected!), good instructions and the range of alterations to the basic patterns they explored in more detail. Impressed to the extent that I had to buy it. I'm in the middle of making one of the bags and the instructions have been good and to the point. The only downside is that the patterns aren't as exact as I would like and there's a bit of figuring out to do before you can cut into your fabric."
5,Lots of great patterns,Love this book! Lots of great styles and patterns that can easily be adapted and changed to create truly personal and unique handbags.
4,A little disappointing in a great series,"Bloody Secrets, the third book in the Miami PI Lupe Solano series, is not quite up to Garcia-Aguilera's high standards. The setting was, as usual, superb, but the plot was thinner than in the previous two novels. The author used the word ""honor"" so much that it lost its meaning. The relationship between Luis and Lupe was never fully developed, and her attraction to him leaves a reader wondering, ""Where did this come from?"" However, the relationship between Lupe and her assistant continues to grow and evolve. Worth reading, but the first two books (Bloody Waters and Bloody Shame) are superior reads."
2,"Not much ""mystery""","I really enjoyed the earlier books in this series. But ""Bloody Secrets"" did not live up to that standard -- the mystery was thin, the writing repetitive and tedious, and at the end a few areas remained unclear or contradictory."
3,Diary of a sourpuss,"When a reviewer calls Coltrane's playing 'possessed continually by an almost Scandinavian unloveliness', and questions Thelonious Monk's sense of rhythm, you start to get a feel for what kind of jazz he'll go for. And you'd be right: nothing ever seems to please Larkin quite so much as old-school big band or dixieland, and he's not afraid to say so. Still, he's a good writer and all, so if you're looking for a collection of jazz reviews from the 60s written by a slightly stuffy guy who never really got over Woody Herman, this is the book for you."
3,"A Useful Biography, But Little Else","Marian Anderson was certainly one of the finest singers America produced in the 20th Century, a fact made abundantely clear by this book. If you want a good biography, this one will do. Do not buy this book if you want a discography of her, however. What is provided is utterly wretched. The title alludes to a real discography being part of the book, but this is not the case. What is here is a list of LP relases. There is no systematic and researched listing of the records she made, when she made them or where or with whom. Neither is there a listing of her many broadcast appearances or the extant recordings of same. All of this data so dear and necessary to a genuine record collector is absent here. The biographical section is not at all bad, and shows the work of a careful researcher, but the real Marian Anderson -- like the real Callas -- is found on her records, and those are given the short shrift in this book."
1,WRONG C.D.,"I ORDERED THIS CRISTY LANE C..D. BECAUSE IT HAD SONGS ON THERE I LIKED , BUT WHEN IT ARRIVED THERE WAS A DIFFERENT CD IN THE CASE.THAN WHAT THE CASE INFORMATION WAS SHOWING. IN OTHER WORDS RIGHT CASE WRONG C.D."
4,Listen to it all the time in my car,I bought this because I like good Christian music and like listening to it in the car. I am often driving alone and find and find myself singing along. It is very good for me emotionally and spiritually. If you like good Christian music you will like this album.
5,She left a thorn in my heart,I first heard this in a 12 passenger van with no seatbelts travelling NASCAR fast on a two lane road through the moutains in Honduras. I had to laugh once I got over being scared. The bridge starting 2 minutes and 36 seconds into the song will absolutely make your heart soar!
5,Works better than expected,Bought this toenail clipper because of the size of the handle for easy grip. Was impressed it cut my toenails with ease. Very happy I purchased this product.
1,Returned and haven't received credit yet,"I thought these were fingernail clippers and they were toenail clippers. Because they came from one of your ""associates"" I had quite a time returning the product. There was nothing on the enclosed paperwork except an order # and when I went into Amazon to return, I input the order # and got a message that it was an incorrect #. Finally, I got your phone # from google and they contacted the associate who contacted me. I have sent it back over a week and a half and have not yet received my credit. I doubt if I would ever order from Amazon again."
4,Conan continues,Anybody who likes Conan will enjoy these reprodutions of the original Marvel comic series. My only complaint is that they did not reprint the covers.
3,what I think,"Take my advice, do not do a book report on this book. for one thing this book ends without completing the jouney of the book. And if he book doesn't complete the journey how are you suppose to understand it? And, because of this, I didn't understand the connections of the puzzle that ""Cheyne"" and the other characters were trying to solve. Also part 1 was suppose to help you understand the plot of the story better but it didn't help as much as I needed."

1,A fair back rest if you are a petite woman,"This is one of four backrests I bought from Amazon in hopes of getting one or two that help support my lower back, providing a natural curve to the lower spine. The ridges on each side of this support are way to close together for my back to fit into so what I feel is my back resting on the ridges which in not comfortable at all. Now, I am 6' tall and weigh 165lbs so I should be able to fit into a support built for the normal- sized adult male. This cushion would appear to fit a petite woman's back.I don't recommend this support for most adults."
1,Celia,"I did not care for this product.The picture looks great, but the strap was not large enough for my chair and the product itself is very small (not wide enough).It was a waist of my time and money, since it actually made my back pain worse."
2,HP Printer Toner Cartrdige,There were broken pieces of plastic falling off of the printer cartridge when I took it out of the box.The cartridge IS working okay but I am concerned about its integrity and longevity.
3,I like it alot but I'm not in love,"Pros:Fits well with good adherence and little peeling; nice feel to touch while typing, not like hard plastic or stiff vinyl; great metallic gold color, more muted than this picture showsCons:Function keys and top row keys DO NOT MATCH macbook pro 15 unibody model keyboard, and not just by a few keys.... The solid gold-colored background means that the backlighting for the keys can't be seen but neither can the grey of the aluminum body behind the keys. You get a solid gold covering for the entire keyboard area for better or worse. Less clacking when you type makes it less noisy for public consumption. However, I like the sound and tactile crunch more like a typewriter so I miss the noise :(GO TO ISISGEAR DOT COM AND BUY THIS FOR ONE THIRD THE PRICE LISTED ON AMAZON. THIS PRODUCT IS NOT WORTH MORE THAN $5-10 EVEN FOR THE NOVELTY OF THE GOLDEN COLOR!"
3,FALLA EN EL SERVICIO DE ENVIO,EL PRODUCTO ESTA BIEN SOLO QUE NO ME LLEGO A MI DOMICILIO POR QUE VENIA CON OTRO NOMBRE Y TUBE QUE RECOGERLO 65 MILLAS DE MI CASA
2,Product works but packaging was ripped and stained,"Received product on time. UPS box was in fine condition. Inner box of HP toner received in HORRIBLE condition, both ripped up and with stains. Half of box was open. Enough of box seal was unbroken so product could not fall out, so we opened it up fully. Plastic packaging had not been broken through. Installed toner and it works fine. Concerned it may not be original and may not last as long as it is supposed to. Will keep it but will probably order from someone else next time. If a product box is damaged and stained, seller should be clear about that so there are no concerns for customer receiving what they believe to be a new and unused product."
3,HP LaserJet 03A Toner Cartridge,"HP LaserJet 03A Black Print Cartridge in Retail PackagingThis product worked acceptably, nothing special. Upon first use, I experienced large ink dots stuck to the paper which could be scraped off with a fingernail. The cartridge leaving these ink dots gradually faded away with use; it now only happens occasionally. On most printing, the print is light, but I am not sure if this is not due to the printer as the print quality is no worse with this cartridge than on any of the others that I have used, so I'll reserve judgment for now."
5,exactly what i needed at the best price,"I bought a knockoff cartridge a while ago, and when it came time to use it, that cartridge gave me gray type. So I had to work fast. I could've gone to some well-known stors and broken the bank at outrageous prices. But this was reasonable, and the type was BLACK. Yay."
5,this is amazing!,"holy moley. this thing is amazing. i have the white 2008 macbook, and this thing fits perfectly. i've tried a few other keyboard protectors, and they were either very sticky/tacky in texture, ill fitting, flimsy, or unable to stay in place. also, the majority of these products were ugly and cheap looking.this jimmy is very attractive against the gold, and fits seamlessly. it looks like i painted my keyboard! it's easy to put on, as the key slots are super defined and well matched. the texture is almost silky, but it doesn't slide around.i love this product very very much! i would have it just for the look even if it wasn't a great investment for the protection of my computer."
1,The product never arrived!!!,"I never got the product!!!; I e-mailed the company and also, didn't got and answer. Is there a -5 rating???IG"
3,Good but after a while it seems to cause paper jams,"For some reason with my 5P using ""genuine"" HP parts and toner after about 2,000 sheets printed my printer seems to jam all the time. This is even if I use the good paper and the genuine HP toner.I always wonder if HP has this in mind when they say it can print 4,000 sheets with 5% coverage but they don't mention the fact that you will have to clear a paper jam for each sheet after 2,000.Each time I replace the toner the system is happy again for about another 2,000 sheets."
1,NOT an original HP Cartridge as stated and pictured--BAIT AND SWITCH,"Ordered cartridge and it came quickly, but product received is not what was described or pictured in ad. Just a Chinese refilled cartridge in generic packaging. Don't know the quality of it, cause I won't use it since it's not what I ordered. BLATANT BAIT AND SWITCH."
1,Bait and Switch,"Received a refilled cartridge in a generic box, not the ""Original HP LaserJet Black Print Cartridge in Retail Packaging"" as advertised. I guess the price was way too low to be HP original, but I assumed that anything advertised on Amazon would be legit. (HP does not sell refilled cartridges.)I'm too lazy to ship it back, so I'll install it and start using it.Amazon should pressure the seller (Target, I believe) to be honest with it's product descriptions. Simply say, ""Refilled Cartridge"" and don't show HP's original box."
1,Target - Company Review,"This company completely misrepresented their product. This is not an 'Original JP LaserJet 03A Black Print Cartridge in Retail Pkg"" as advertised. Its a 3rd-party copy made in China. What a waste of time ordering and waiting for a product that is needed. We will NEVER do business with this company again. Surely many other customers have experience similar circumstances with this company as we. Thanks for listening."
5,One of my favorite movies,"I love the songs and the premise of the movie. Excellent remake of Pygmalion story, including superior actors and environment."
4,One of the most practical books in this field,"Jerry Minchinton's book gave me a lot more than I expected from 79 pages. It is a very practical book, one of the best that I have read in this field. Its thoughts and ideas canbe applied to anyones lifestyle. This book shows us how past experiences and thoughts relate to our present self esteem andit gives us steps to take to improve our selfesteem for our benefit."
3,Not what I was looking for ....,"Well .... the description of this product was somewhat mis-leading, at least for me ... in that it said it was soft which is what I was looking for to ease my movements when fishing; instead the flotation is too rigid just like all the others ( that sell much cheaper !! ), but not too bad at that so I kept it. Also, I expected it to be slighly longer at the waist, but I guess Stearns wanted to save on material, so I would judge it to be about 3-4"" too short, although it comes with leg straps to eleminate it riding up towards your head. All and all for $65 I think it's way overpriced for was you get, I think!!! Good thing there was free shipping or I wouldn't have bought for that much money !!"
5,Smooth haunting,"I have to say that I enjoyed this book as well as all the other reviewers did. Moloney's style is tactful and liquid. I am a big fan of horror, shock, splatter and the like, but I especially like haunted house themes. Nice and creepy..........that's what I'm talking about. The kind of creep that stays with you even when you're not reading the story. The kind of creep that freaks me out when I have to shut all the lights out and go to bed and think to myself, ""Now could I handle hearing something like and stay in my house?"", or ""I wonder what I would do if something unseen just touched me like that?""I put myself in the characters positions and give my over imaginative mind a work out.You know it's a good book when you can put it down and freak your own self out."
5,Masterful,"This is a welcome throwback to the well-crafted horror novels of the 1970s. This novel richly deserves the accolades it has earned. The writing is evocative and well-crafted. Creepy, understated, and surprisingly good. This novel is a page-turner to say the least. I can't recommened this novel enough. Susie Moloney is a wonderful writer.I sincerely hope this novel does very well in the mass market. It's a much needed ""shot in the arm"" to the horror genre. It's the best horror novel that I've read in a very long time. Highly-recommeneded."
4,READ IT!,"A successful and enjoyable entry in the ""haunted house"" field. Susie Moloney is a whiz at character development. The only bone I have to pick is the ""epilog"" or last brief chapter which explains the obvious. No matter, this is a great read and I am a newly converted Susie fan!"
4,Watch out for Plot Spoilers!,"Be careful of reading some of these reviews! The best thing about a scary story is not knowing what will happen next. Fortunately I read ""The Dwelling"" BEFORE reading the reviews posted here, because far too many plot details are revealed."
4,Good introduction to The Colorado Trail,"This small format book gives a taste of what The Colorado Trail has to offer along its 470 miles. This should not be used as a guidebook, but rather a primer to single day trips along the trail. The information is good and will have the reader wanting more.Happy Hiking!"
1,Not posable,I'll keep this real simple. The doll is not posable. I have the Kermit the Frog doll....that is posable. This doll? Just a regular stuffed animal.
4,Gift for a friend,I bought this as a gift for a friend whose favorite muppet is Miss Piggy. She loved it.
4,change of pace,"This movie has been long waiting for any Olivia and Errol fans. It is a shame these two did not do more comedy together. They are really fun to watch. The movie is typical 30's screwball comedy, so popular at that time. it is fast paced and witty humor though out. What i don't like is there are no extras of the making of it, and Warners did not take the time or care to restore this film as much as others like ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"". Still this is very much worth watching. Olivia and Errol out of their usual costume dramas, and into something contemporary for its time.I highly recommend it. Also look for the little terrier in the movie. It is the same dog who played Asta in all the old Thin Man Movies, Bringing up Baby and many more"
1,Four's a Crowd DVD,"This DVD was manufactured to be played on a ""play only"" machine. It will not play on a ""play/record"" machine. It states this fact in small print on the back cover. This should be made known to the person buying same to avoid disappointment and the necessity of sending the DVD back. I would have wanted to know this before I purchased the product."
3,"no, i'm not in love","olive's cover of ""i'm not in love"" is a mediocre attempt to update 10CC's original. if you want a good cover of this tune, check out tori amos's version on ""strange little girls"""
3,British espionage caper,"The New Avengers was a British espionage series that ran for two seasons, updating the original Avengers series for a 1970s audience. With lead actor Patrick Macnee already in his fifties, his role was redefined to be a mentor to the younger generation. Always suave and unflappable, he imparts his wisdom and experience to two new agents in their twenties. Joanna Lumley, then nearly unknown, brought a combination of intelligence and sensuality to her character. The late Gareth Hunt played his role with a blend of ironic humor and steely determination. The scripts were often clever, although at times too fanciful. The direction was outstanding. The main limitation of this series was the small number of episodes actually produced."
1,"'Twas ""MOTHER"" killed The Avengers...","...But it was Clemens & Co. that tried to resurrect them from the dead, just like Dr.Frankenstein. And just like in the classic story that sprang from the darkest wells of the mind of a famous poets young bride so very long ago, ""The New Avengers"" '76 and '77 came crashing down in a blazing pile of rubble and heartbreaking agony! - ""The dead should remain dead."""
5,If there were 6 stars this would get it,"Dusty Springfield was a singers singer and this box of 2 cds is a testemonial. It also has such diversity and continuity it is a wonder. Now what is it that Dusty has that none of the others have? Well intelligence and emotion in equal doses. Her mastery of french and italian, and the aid of some hand picked producers. This set includes some of her best and most obscure late 60s work Buy it, you'll do well by it! My favorite cuts are Wasn't Born to Follow, and I am Your Child."
2,Not quite what I was expecting . . .,"Well, first off, this thing is tiny. The 7"" mentioned in the product description is measured diagonally, from beak to tail. Second, the color isn't anything like the picture. Instead of grey, the wings are a sort of mossy green. I think my 18 month old won't mind, so I might keep it, but I'm disappointed."
3,sound advice,"I bought this book because of the author and I found it to contain sound advice, although it was a bit dry at times. I would suggest this book if you are thinking about using CGI math and are not convinced yet!"
2,poor packageing,Was very disappointed in the way this was packaged.I have the ultimate collection 1 & 2 and there is a little booklet with it that tells a little about each episode. The official season 2 does not have a booklet it just has it UNDER the dvds. This is NOT worth more than 14.99 if it is worth that.The Beverly Hillbillies: The Official Second Season
3,Beverly Hillbillies tv show,"I hope all seasons for Beverly Hillbillies, Petticoat Junction, and Green Acres are released.Where is season 1 of The Beverly Hillbillies?All three series are inter connected in one way or another."
1,Bad Packaging.,"There has been speculation as to when The Beverly Hillbillies would reappear on DVD. However there are two ""Ultimate Collections"", Vol. 1 & 2 and Paramount is starting with ""The Official Season Two"". What exactly is ""Official""? Is it the ""Complete"" season two? After waiting a long time for this, the packaging alone is disastrous. After reading a few of the reviews regarding Paramount, I'll pass even though I love the Hillbillies. They obviously need a new graphic design artist."
5,wonderfull,another clean classic comedy show from the 70s.the kids and watch and you dont have to blind fold them.great show
1,No support at all,"This was advertised as the most popular nursing gown, bra-less but with some built in support. It had no support, and if I chose a size to fit my breasts, the rest of it looked like a deflated hot-air-balloon. Very oddly constructed, and certainly not enough support, even light support for night wear."
3,Pretty gown - little bust support,"I found my breasts would fall out of the cups at night while I slept, if I turned on my side. Also, there is little support - I had the straps shortened and still found myself hiking myself up. The fabric needs more memory - the lack of support was due to the fabric quickly stretching. The gown was pretty though, and the fabric was nice and thick. It was rather form-fitting... so be careful when you walk by the mirror sideways 3 days post-partum!"
1,Terrible Customer Service,"I ordered two nightgowns, same size, same color, a few weeks ago and only one arrived. There is no indication the other item is on back order. I've been calling for over a week, trying to get through to someone, but there is noone available to accept calls. You are put through to a machine, to leave a message, and noone returns your call. I'm very disappointed and wonder if it's a matter of neglect or if I'm being ignored purposefully. This company lacks responsibility and integrity. Deal with them with extreme caution."
3,Not so satisfied,"This nursing dress is good in that it holds nursing pads in place without a bra but the sizing is difficult to figure out (I ended up getting the wrong size) and it is very snug around the stomach. After all these gowns were designed for mothers who had just had babies and are working on reducing their tummys, so you'd think the designers would design the dress with extra room in that area. I found the dress to be just like any old basic stretchy dress, and was a bit disappointed because it was nothing special for the nursing mother."
1,Disappointed,"I received the night gown, tried it on, and actually hated it. The built in bra was loose, as was the top and there was just too much fabric up top. The straps are too wide. The rest of the gown was okay, although it too seemed too drapey and long.I sent the gown back 3 weeks ago, now, and have STILL not received a refund. I am very disappointed with the whole transaction/product."
5,Great gift for nursing mom.,This Aimee Gowns Original Bra-less Nursing Gown is a great gift for a new nursing mother. I recommend it highly.
2,disappointing,"I bought this gown and the robe (Aimee Gowns Robe) at the same time, and I was surprised and disappointed about how different the fabrics were. The robe is soft and drapey and comfortable; the gown is thicker, stiffer, and somewhat scratchy because of the fabric's bulk. I don't recommend this product at all. As soon as I started nursing and my breasts became tender it was unbearable to wear this garment. I wish they used the same fabric they used for their robes, because the cut of the gown is fine. It's just awful fabric."
3,Nursing Nightgown,"This item is made from nice material but is not accurate size-wise. In addition, when I attempted to return the item, I learned that no refunds or exchanges were allowed after 14 days. This seems like a short period of time for returns. It did not fit and now I'm stuck with it."
3,comfy but not amazing,"I have to admit I was a little disappointed when I tried on this nightgown for the first time. It is very soft and comfortable, which is good, but its main selling point for me was the label ""bra-less nursing nightgown."" That must be wishful thinking, because it definitely does not work without a sleep bra (and I am not a large person by any means). I kept it, because it is still a good nightgown, just doesn't actually work the way it says it does. Save your money and get a nightgown somewhere else--this one is not worth the price."
3,"Ok, still need a bra","I am 3 weeks postpartum, and I've worn this dress at least 15 days out of the 20 days since I gave birth. Very, very comfortable dress! I've even worn it out and about to pediatrician appointments (had to cover up my chest though).I don't understand why it says ""Bra-less"" nursing gown. There is not any padding or anything that would resemble a bra to support what most post partum women have - a size D or more. Elastic to hold nursing pads in place, or even padding to cover larger nipples would have been more representative of the name ""Bra-less"".I was expecting a nicer material (not just plain cotton), but I've found that the cotton is a LOT more comfortable and comfort is my top priority right now. Overall, this is a Nice dress, but a little too pricey for the quality."
2,How is this a nursing gown?,"I wore this nightgown once. It is too hot due to the thick material. This is not a good thing postpartum because you get hot and sweat a lot when you sleep. The biggest problem is that it is simply a low v-neck gown. It is impossible to take a breast out without taking down the shoulders and I can do that with a regular nightgown. I also purchased an Expressiva gown at the same time and like that much better. It is also on the warm side, but it has slits for the breasts and is easy to nurse without getting half undressed."
5,Best night gown ever!,"I purchased my first 2 Aimee nursing gowns when I was expecting since I planned to breast feed. I cannot tell you how great and useful these gowns proved to be for sleeping and breast feeding. Some nights I move around alot in my sleep and regular night gowns bunch and get twisted and I have to straighten them out throughout the night. With the Aimee gown, this was not the case. I can move freely and not feel constricted. Plus, the fabric is soft and the support added for the breasts is great. Even though I quit nursing over 6 months ago, I still wear my aimee gowns, which are very flattering and slimming. My sister commented on how much she like the gowns and I ended up buying her one for Xmas even though she's not pregnant and does not plan on having children anytime soon. I highly recommend these gowns whether or not your nursing."
3,My thoughts,Was great for use after the birth of my baby. I was comfortable walking around the hospital floor because all body parts were covered.
5,Best Ever,This book has amazing recipes and super helpful tips and ideas. Anyone with an Aga needs this book!!!
5,The Gold Standard for pocket knives,I love this knife. It is a great all around knive. It has enough gadgets to get me through most situations. Granted you are not tunnelling out of prison or surviving on Lost with this knife alone but it would be an excellent compliment to any tools you would have. I back up the Swiss Army knife with a Gerber Multitool for real heft with lifting or wrenching needs. This is my third knife. The first fell into a fire and the plastic handles metled but the knife still works; that's now my car knife. The second is my work knife and this one is my camping knife. I enjoy it immensely.
5,what i wanted,"wanted to get a multi-tool, but they were either too expensive or had tools that i didn't need. this knife was exactly what i needed."
4,Satisfied,"Showed up on time, no issues with the shipping.Been using the knife for a monthish and no issues, I purchased this along with Victorinox Swiss Army Classic Pocket Knife for my key chain.Only issue with this is the wrench tool thing is close to useless. I have found uses for everything but that.I'm sure it may come in handy someday, but certainly not for trying to tighten or loosen a nut, even a small one.I have had the most use out of the small blade for opening boxes and packages."
4,out of the shadows,"Enjoyed this doco immensely. Loved the subtlety and the tension created by the shadowy black and white cinematography - the art of suggestion over the in your face style of much of todays cinema offerings. A reminder of what can be achieved on a low budget, with a little imagination and a lot of talent.Garry Stewart- Melbourne , Australia ."
2,Don't Buy This!,"Instead, spend ten dollars more and get this documentary WITH the 9 movie set.The Val Lewton Horror Collection with Martin Scorsese Presents Val Lewton Documentary (Cat People / The Curse of the Cat People / I Walked with a Zombie ... / The Seventh Victim / Shadows in the Dark)"
1,badlands,"too verbose and uninteresting,tiresome and dull. I thought I would try out this author, his ebooks are too expensive and the content tends to not want you to read ahead. Will continue with previous author like Louise Lamour, Johnston etc"
3,camping journal,"We have been looking for a log for our avdentures, did some surfing and found this item . It seemed to fit the bill. The ring binder is a nice feature so the pages stays open to the one you want. Not enough fuel milage log pages only enough for 40 trips if you would only have 2 gas stops per trip. The trip log (campground pages) are great with a checklist and any info you can imagine that you would want to keep. The 2 things I did not like was the front and back covers they are too thin and could have been laminated (I can see my Wife and general use taking a toll on these real quick) and smaller dimensions the size of a book would have been nice instead of a small atlas."
4,Love NBB - Hate how they do their releases.,Second season is missing the 2 concert episodes. Previously they have chosen to release alternate DVD's sold only at Wal-Mart that have extra features. I hope that isn't the case this time. They should not punish those who pre-order a set or force people to shop at Wal-Mart.Only thing that could make this right is if they include the 2 concert episodes on the season 2 music CD release as a bonus.
4,great,exactly what he thought it would be. arrived quickly and was perfect. my son has watched it at least 50 times already.
3,thumbs down on the shipping,It took a really long time to receive this product. We ordered it on 03/14 and didn't receive it until the first week in April. Our daughter had given up on receiving it at all. Very disappointing. We expected to receive it in one to two weeks.
2,No Big Winner in My Book,"I purchased this book because of the very positive reviews. After reading the book I was quite disappointed. The very positive reviews were not accurate. This is not a four or five star book. Its marginally adequate, nothing more. The information is very generic; narrow in scope, with no great insights.In addition to being informationally weak, I felt the author was subtly pushing several internet poker sites. Parts of the book read more like an infomercial than an unbiased informational book. Upon finishing the book, I was left feeling disappointed. The book did not deliver.As an alternative selection, I highly recommend ""Winning at Internet Poker for Dummies"". Although I find the title ""for Dummies"" offensive, the book is excellent, offering indepth, thorough discussions of the various topics involved with internet poker."
3,Hanoi Stories,Good book to dip into to get some ideas about life in Hanoi. Not a lot of overview on Vietnam but amusing stories. Good to read on the plane as doesn't require a lot of concentration
1,IT'S 1 BULB and NOT 2-PACK AS ADVERTISED!,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER - RIPOFF FALSE ADVERTISEMENT! ALSO CHARGED $5.30 TO SEND ME 1 LIGHTBULB ON regular USPS ON TOP OF THE INFLATED PRICE OF $10.99!BUYER BEWARE!
1,Isn't it the light bulb that I ordered,"Once I open the box, the model number is not the same. The light output is 1659 Lumens (not the 1800 Lumens). I can't see anything on the box saying that it is for photo shooting. The box clearly says that this bulk is ideal for table lamps, floor lamps and other open indoor fixtures. Hence I am not getting the right product, which by description is a ""27 Watts 5500K Color corrected day light fluorescent lamp photo bulb"". You can see anything in the box telling you that you receive the right product. DONT BUY IT ....."
1,SINGLE BULB -- Nice House Light; Poor Studio Light,"This is absolutely mislabeled as a 2-pack but was sent as a single bulb (seller sent the 2nd upon request). The bulbs are nowhere near powerful enough for studio lighting and are, in reality, daylight-corrected household CFLs you can get at Lowes for half the price. Nice CFLs but not suitable for the listed purpose."
4,I need more power captain.,Works fine (it's a light bulb - what's not to work?) but if you're gonna shoot thru a diffuser spring for more watts.
3,A disappointment in comparison to the Spanish version.,"It is a beautiful song, I can't disagree with that, but in Spanish everythign flows, in English, it just sounds a bit awkward. I like the song, but if u haven't heard the whole thing in Spanish adn the rest of the songs on the cd u are missing something."
3,Add a dash of...something,"Very good by conventional music standards -- deep, rich, rhythmic, well-engineered and superb as background music for parties, studying, or turning inward. If you are bored with mainstream (or even the top layer of underground) music, check this out.But, as alluded to in other reviews, a bit homogenous for Laswell. He has a killer formula, but it's still a formula."
2,"Shiny, but still scratched","I bought this product in order to remove the scratches from my iPod. After using it exactly as directed, which involved large amounts of scrubbing with an unpleasant smelling goo, the scratches were still on my iPod. The iPod was shinier, I admit, but if you want a shiny iPOd you could probably use a wet cloth and get the same results. The miracle sounding 'gets rid of all scratches' is competely untrue. Not even the small scratches disappeared."
2,Was not good,"I do not recomend this product. I bought it and I tried cleaning off the scratches on my ipod for 1 hour. I repeated the applications, used a lot of pressure, I used both the deep scratch remover and the regular polish. By they end only a few minor scratches were gone, the deep ones no matter how hard I tried were still present, and the cloth that came with the icleaner left new scratches on my ipod. I have a new 30g 5th generation video ipod, and I heard that the screen is very sensitive, so that could be the reason for the icleaner not working."
5,Excellent Bible,"The print in this bible is a good size 12pt., but what makes it even better is that the print is dark which makes it easier to see. The bible is large so it's not the best bible to carry around, but great for home or teaching so you can lay it on a surface. It's nice to have the word definitions on the same page. I also have this Bible in the medium print 10pt. And because of the dark print it is even easier to read. The medium is a good size to carry around. I personally think this is a wonderful Bible and recommend it."
2,Thanx for the explanations of the archaisms but ...,"... why not use a modern version that uses modern terms in the *main text*? It would save a lot of *unnecessary* work, which could be better spent on learning the original Hebrew and Greek.Alas, both authors are known KJV-only advocates, with all the misinformation that this entails. Even if they were right about the Textus Receptus vs. the Alexandrian textual family (which they are *not*), why not produce an updated translation? Jay P. Green Sr., a strong TR advocate, has done just this with the ""Modern KJV"", and Dr Kouric has done this with the KJV-2000, but apart from this kept the rhythm of the KJV (search on the Internet). Even the NKJV is based on the TR, despite a lot of misinformation to the contrary, e.g. their use of footnotes -- which is exactly what the *real* 1611 KJV did, as opposed to the Blayney revision of 1769 -- which this work is."
1,Need for Newer Translations,"i bought one of these when it first came out. I have met D.A.,on quite a few occasions, and he is truly a fine, educated gentleman. But, I feel he is dead wrong. What amused me no end is that I counted approximately 35 times from cover to cover, where the name 'Waite' is mentioned. I don't understand the whys of printing an entire Bible(which is well-made, by the way), defining antiquated KJ language, when a modern version speaks modern English. If you have to have hundreds of definitions of these words, then, indirectly, D.A., is advising the use of a modern translation where any sort of dictionary is not needed. Thank you, D.A., for in your own way recommending a modern version!"
4,Gokd costume for the price,Was worth as much as I paid (which wasn't a lot). Some areas werent sewn right but it fits good.
3,english book,The book was received in very good condition as noted by the seller. I have been using it for an English class. Very satisfied with the purchase.
4,This is a CD with heart,"I first heard this CD on a public radio station and promptly went and ordered it. Cosy sounds like Shawn Colvin but is a little bouncier and less sultry. My favorite tracks are the title track (which is reminiscent of the child's book Harold's Crayon) which is irresistable but sadly very short ; George and His 88 Keys (I can't listen to it without crying - it's the grandfather equivalent of Butterfly Kisses) and an absolutely beautiful song that says everything about the life of the heart in a nutshell: Some Fires. There is one track called Bad Cliche which is almost too painful to listen to, a disturbing account of child sexual abuse and recovery - but it's a compelling song. Another is the thought provoking Don't Go In the Water - for those of us who live with uranium tailings, it's a fact of life. Over all, this is worth your money - I hope she gets more and more exposure!"
3,Quivers A Life,"I am a big Howard Stern fan and I just had to read this book. I found it to be enjoyable in the begining (Robin's early life), but I got bored about three quarters way through. The book is written by her, so we miss some outside views on how she really is in her life outside of the studio.I found the book a little self serving and you get the impression she thinks very highly of herself.I would recommend the book if you get it for a good price on the used self."
1,Unintentionally hilarious.,"It's a sometimes sad tale, though lightened by the unbelievably pompous and juvenile prose style of the author. Her desperate attempts at pretentiousness are undermined by her lack of facility with language. This would be a fine title for anyone interested in learning how not to write."
2,Indulgent,"Wow! It's funny but not for the right reasons. You can really see how Robin scored so highly on the narcissism test. It was kind of hard to get through, but i love Robin!"
5,The Hardest Working Woman in Show Business,"I have but one thing to say here for anyone who thinks that he or she does not like Robin Quivers: Buy this book and read it from front to back and then form your opinion. Robin is a wonderful human being and if you are lucky enough to meet her, you will know what I am talking about. This book brings you up to date on whatever you wanted to know abut her and more. Its a fun read and a well written one at that. Even if you are not a Stern fan does not mean you cannot enjoy his book as well. There are plenty of Stern moments in here but as I said it is about Robin her name alone is enough to keep the reader enthused and impressed.Paneeks/Boston"
3,Good background Knowledge,"If you like to listen or watch Howard Stern, and you love his side kick Robin, then this book is a must read. It gives you insite to her life and helps explain a lot of things. While it was not the best book I have read, I did enjoy it."
2,The best book I've ever read??,"Robin Quivers tells it all in this exciting book. The responsible news women has a soft and sexy side, not shown on her daily talk show with Howard Stern. You must read this book to learn all the secrets and myths that dwell in Mrs. Quivers."
2,Mislead,"I purchased this book as a gift under the impression that it was ""new"" however, I was extremely embarrassed when it arrived at my sister-in-law's home... it was a used library book. Very disappointed."
3,Not as good as Hilside Airstrip,"This album isn't as good as Hillside Airstrip. If you are new to the Plant, get Hillside first. That being said, I havn't gotten a chance to hear their new album yet.Also, did anyone notice that the song Sweet Country is the same baseline recycled from Let The Music Hit? I was listening and thought ""is my player on repeat"" but nope, they recycled the song. Very unoriginal, I was not impressed.Check out the track Chanting Nyabinghi, a very cool dub track."
3,"Fox Searchlight Spotlight Series, Vol #3","This is the third three disc set being released by Fox Studios under their Searchlight Spotlight Series. This set contains Boys Don't Cry, Antwone Fisher and The Last King Of Scotland. Vol #1 contains Napoleon Dynamite, Little Miss Sunshine and Juno. Vol #2 contains The Full Monty, Bend It Like Beckham and Waitress. Vol #4 contains Garden State, Sideways and Thank You For Smoking. All four three disc series are being released about the same time."
5,Knit Fashions in Motion is AWESOME!,"The holidays are com'n up and if you're looking for trendy project ideas to give as gifts or keep for yourself then you should definitely check out this DVD. I knit my grandkids socks every year so I thought I'd change it up a bit now that they're a little older and w/ the help of this dvd I learned to make a purse, fingerless gloves, a cellphone holder and a scarf set=) Knit Fashions in Motion is a ""must have"" for gift ideas and the patterns you'll learn are soooo cute!"
3,Lots of Cookie Jars,Book was o.k. but I felt it was a little outdated. The pictures could be update to look more visually enticing. Still great as a reference tool.
4,Good book for users new to the Windows enviroment.,"The eye-catching cover yields to make the forager for WinCE books. It starts with a realistic scenario, and goes step by step into the CE world. Every built-in program is covered in here, and even some third-party software/hardware. It is a good book for newbies, and for people who know a bit about Windows 95, 3.x, etc., (the Windows CE OS is pretty self-explanitory) there is a share of advanced things. The biggest downfall is that for the many people who use Windows CE for compatibility (and know the Windows 95 enviroment,) it is a bit too basic. And, for people having 3-4 years of Windows use, there is really nothing REALLY important in this book.Overall: Good introduction of CE books to the shelf."
1,Don't purchase if you occasionally print,"I rarely print - perhaps a page or two once a month on average. These cartridges appear to dry up and/or clog if you don't regularly print. I'd get one use out of them, then nothing. I tried cleaning & deep cleaning multiples times to no effect.Genuine Canon cartridges don't suffer this problem; I can go months without printing and come back and print with no issue. Don't buy these cartridges if you're an occasional printer; you'll regret it."
5,Canon BCI-24 Compatible Ink Cartridge,"The black ink works almost exactly the same as the Canon brand. I did have some difficulty trying to get the color ink to work though. The colors never came out exactly as they were supposed to so it never looked quite as good as it should have. However, there is a big price difference for the compatible cartridges and if you can get them to work it is well worth it."
2,Black's are having some problems,I have noticed a small problem with a couple of the Black cartridges. They seem to run out quick but in doing so they have no ink streaks. Then I clean the heads and their fine. The problem has occurred 2-3 times already and I am only on my 2nd cartridge. I suspect the quality of the ink is poor and is clogging up the print head.
3,Nice price but...you get what you pay for,The color cartridge just doesn't last very long. Should have known considering the price on these. I will say the OEM cartridge doesn't exactly last really that much longer.
5,Very good deal,This is the best price for the ink cartridges for my printerand the shipping was fast. It's the best deal that I have had.
2,fun da mental,"This is the book I wanted, it's in good shape, it arrived quickly, and the price was right.Thanks!"
1,"Awful, both in topic and execution","This is NOT the book to buy if you are looking for a sexy tale to get you revved up. Topics covered in this book include, drugs, prostitution, rape, incest, murder, child abuse and a host of other dark acts. Even if you are into things being rough, nothing in these situations is ""Safe, Sane, and Consensual."" There are two SHORT scenes of healthy sex, but not enough to temper the other content. Furthermore, the scenes are not written in a way that draw the reader in; they are trite and unadorned. Much of this book seems to be shocking for shock's sake. Overall, there are no redeeming qualities. There are better erotic stores out there and there is better urban fiction out there. This book did not accomplish a realistic and effective telling of either."
2,I FOUND THIS DISAPPOINTING.,"I found Noire's book The G-Spot to be well written but disappointing.It was sort of like reading The Color Purple or one of those badViking romances where the heroine is raped repeatedly, then somewhere around page 395, the hero decides he loves the person he has treated so cruelly. Also, what was with the Disney ending after all the brutality? Did Noire wimp out with this sweet little ending which seemed to have no relationship to the rest of the story? I read this and every time Juicy has any hint of happiness you know she will be whipped down for it later. The sex scenes seemed too mechanical and made me wonder if Noire is a man. I'm sure some readers will enjoy this glorification of drugs, power and violence but it just didn't do much for me. And erotic? About as erotic as dirty dish water."
5,G-Spot . . . Better Than The Coldest Winter AND Addicted,"Noire takes you on an unforgettable and unimaginable journey with her characters Juicy, Granite, and Gino. The hot and steamy sex scenes leaves you wanting more while the violent sex scenes make you steaming hot (MAD).Money and love makes these characters take life-threatening risks that leaves you holding your breath and your breasts. Juicy is a beautiful young woman with needs and a possive older lover who goes ballistic whenever he feels he's not man enough to satisfy Juicy's sexual appetite or if he suspects Juicy is cheating on him.Granite McKay, despite his abusive ways, isn't man enough for Juicy. With all of his money, power, and threats, Juicy still falls in love with Granite's son, Gino.Is blood thicker than water? Will Granite choose his relationship with Juicy over his relationship with his son? Or will Granite McKay kill both of them?You MUST read G-Spot and find out!"
5,Whoa!,"I have to say that when I first say the books title that I was a little thrown, but once you read it you will be shocked. This is the best urban fiction that I have read since ""The Coldest Winter Ever."" This story had the elements of it all, Drugs, Strip clubs, Ballers, junkies, and murder. It captures the essence of the streets, without glorifying the drama.I finished this book in a few hours. I'm happy that I decided to read it on a lazy Saturday because if I had to read it during the week I think I would have been caught reading at my desk, or I would've been up all night trying to take it all in. After I finished I grabbed another novel and began reading but this morning I got up and re-read the ending of ""G-Spot"" and I was floored by it all over again.The erotica in this book is very well written. Kudos, to Noire on her first ""urban erotic tale."" I look forward to many, many more."
4,Raw & Rugged,"This was my first book by Noire and it was a great read. Not quite as erotic as I had been expecting but plenty of sex, violence and action.It is easy to see why Noire is an Essence Best Selling author. Well written and worth buying."
5,G-Spot Is The Spot For Real!,"This was a very interesting book to read. This definitely wasn't a romance. This was truly an urban erotic tale to the T, and it starts at G-Spot. Most of my reading experience with this book, I couldn't put it down. At times I would try staying up reading this book as long as I can from having a long day. Its a good read. I definitely recommend G-Spot, and don't forget G-Spot 2 Pride: the first deadly sin which is told in seven different parts. Its a must read. I know Noire has many good books under her belt, and this is my second book I read, and will have all in my possession. She's one of my top 10 Authors in the literary world. I love Noire. Noire, me personally, you are worth 10 stars baby. Keep blessing us for what you do. So urban readers go get G-Spot, G-Spot2 Pride; the 1st deadly sin, and others under Noire. Go to AskNoire.com Twitter.com/AskNoire Facebook.com/NoireBlack - Readers make Noire your favorite."
5,HOOD ROMANCE,"THIS BOOK WAS INTERESTING FROM THE TITLE YOU JUST EXPECT IT TO BE ALL ABOUT SEX BUT IT'S DEEPER THAN THAT ONCE YOU READ ABOUT JUICEY AND GINO'S LOVE FOR ONE ANOTHER IT BECOMES MORE OF A HOOD ROMANCE THAN JUST A BOOK ALL ABOUT SEXING. I LOVE HOW NOIRE PORTRAYS EACH OF THE CHARACTERS FROM G, THE COLD-HEARTED BALLER TO JIMMY, JUICEY'S ""SOUL"". THIS IN MY OPINION IS A MUST READ!"
1,waste of money,i got sick to my sick reading this book and the only reason i finished reading it was because i paid 12.47 for it
5,nelbo,"I absolutely love love this book. I would recommend anyone who has had not read this book to please do. It was well written, props to Noire.I read this book in one day I would read it all over again. Juicy the main character shows Mind, Body and Soul, and how much her brother meant to her. This is a must have. It made me laugh, cry and fall in love with Juicy. She has endure so much pain but she managed to overcome and find happiness. I cant wait for Noire's upcoming book am sure it will be the bomb."
3,Keep a Paper Trail...,I enjoyed this one. Keep the characters in mind when reading the ones to follow because it's going to work your memory. This is where it starts..and a good start it is....
4,MY SPOT,"I REALLY LIKE THIS BOOK. I LOVE JUICY BECAUSE AT ONE POINT IN MY LIFE I COULD RELATE TO HER SEX LIFE. SMH!!!! THE BOOK BECAME A LIL PREDICTABLE AT THE END, BUT OTHER THAN THAT, IT WAS GOOD"
3,A decent read but could have been a lot better & hotter,"Despite my luke warm opinion on this book I still have love for my girlNoire.I have read a lot of the reviews on this book & it appears to be a large amount of mixed feelings on G-Spot,some good & some bad.The maincharacter Juicy basically goes to hell and back in a violent and abusiverelationship with her pimping,drug dealing,hustling boyfriend known on themean streets of Harlem as Granite ""G"" Mckay.I have so many mixed opinionson this book I dont know where to start,it's a decent kinky read but notworth getting excited about.This book does point out one very importantand sad fact that to many young girls are in these violent & abusive typerelationships.It shows what some women have to go through just to keep aroof over there heads,food in there stomachs & clothes on there backs.Thisbook wont win any awards it is what it is an urban erotic tail of physicaland sexual abuse,torture,pain & terror."
2,It would have been great if these characters had a brain,"Although I enjoyed parts of the story, it really bothered me how stupid the main girl was and how she let herself be the victim rather than doing what made sense; she should have gone to someone to get her a gun, waited till she was in bed with G, blown him away, and taken her brother with her before things got so out of hand. But no. She had to sleep with the man's son and was actually surprised that she had been set up and that G would kill Jimmy. [...]"
3,First time reader of this author....,"It's an easy read. If you're entertained by urban erotica then it serves it purpose. Its has all the elements of an urban fiction novel plus a bit of detailed sex scenes. However, I think Zane has the most detailed sex scenes. If you don't want an author to skimp out on the nitty gritty, try her out. otherwise, Noire isn't a bad choice either."
3,Over The Top,"While the book was certainly an entertaining and quick read, for me, the book did not qualify as erotic. Eroticism is more about the thought and emotion behind an encounter and less about the explicit sexual details (i.e. I don't need to know the graphic details of every single sexual encounter to get the point). No, I'm not a prude, I enjoy explicit sex scenes, but not at the expense of the story. Thus, the story was not as tight as I would have hoped, but I must say the danger and intrigue Noire wove into the tale did keep my heart pumping."
2,FOR MATURE READERS ONLY!,"THIS BOOK WAS VERY WELL WRITTEN. THE TITLE WAS VERY MISLEADING AS WELL AS THE GENRE THE BOOK HAS BEEN PLACED IN. THERE IS NOTHING EROTIC ABOUT THIS BOOK. THE RAPE AND PURE VIOLENCE IN THIS BOOK WAS A BIT MUCH. AND FOR THE MOST PART SEVERAL CHARACTERS COULD HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT OR EXPLORED MORE TO GIVE THE READER A CHANCE TO KNOW THEM. I THOUGHT HER BROTHERS ILLNESS SHOULD HAVE BEEN EXPLAINED MORE IN DEPTH. I WAS DRAWN TO THE TITLE G-SPOT, AS A WOMEN IN HER EARLY 40'S MY INTEREST WAS PEAKED BY THAT ALONE. HOWEVER, I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WAS NOT MENTIONED BUT 2 TIMES IN THE WHOLE BOOK.THIS BOOK IS DEFINETLY STREET FICTION AND PAGE TURNER, JUST WISH THE AUTHOR WOULD HAVE GIVEN US MORE OF THE SEX AND LESS OF THE RAPE AND VIOLENCE. WOULD SUGGEST THAT A WARNING LABEL BE PLACED ON THE COVER."
4,Good book overall.,Overall this book was great I couldnt stop reading nonstop took me 2 days to finish off this book. When I read I thought I was watching a mafia movie. I would love to read more books like this.
4,Too similar to Candy Licker,"After reading this book, I'm finding too many similiarities to Candy Licker. Both girls Juicy and Candy are around the same age, the setting is in New York, both have younger sibling to look after and ended up losing them toward the end, both had junkie no good mothers, both had pimps who uses and mistreats them, both of them had bigger breasts and some package underneath, they both lost close friends, both were mixed, and they eventually have lovers that would treat them with more respect. Despite all these comparisons, I enjoy the book. I couldn't help but feel remorse how these two young girls had to have it the hard way just to get through life. It's sad how these bastards have to treat them like they're not worth anything. The lifestyles that they live in is sad. It makes me want to hate guys!!!!!"
4,Great read,This book was a very good book to read I read it within a day I recommed the author to all...
3,Lead Female Character Lost!,"I found this an interesting read! I notice with Noire books the female characters are sooooo weak! As a female, I find this very disturbing. Women aren't as easily played and abused as Noire depicts his women in his books. In the G Spot and Thug a Licious both lead females are raped and denigrated and I find no reward for these characters at the end of the book. I think Noire writes one-sided and really speaks from a male voice and not a neutral voice seeing both sides of love and redemption.Angela"
4,a...hot....remarkable.....situational reading,This is truly a Zane book mixed with Sistah Soujah ideas. this book will have you on the floor with anticipation. You will have to stop everything that you are doing to enjoy the ride. the characters in the book will experience so much that you feel like your in the book with them. Words cant explain why you should get this book. Its better than The Coldest Winter Ever but they are similar.
3,It was good but...,This book was good but it turned me off a little bit. The plot was excellent just some of the things that the main character was forced to do made me sick to my stomach. The part where she had to suck her brother's **** was horrible. It was almost like torture for me to read about all the sexual exploitation that she had to succumb to. I would not reccomend this book to anyone under the age of 21 but other than that it was a good read.
3,Predictable,"The characters were good. Juicy the main character is young with a high sex drive and no street smarts at all. She is always fantasizing and the poor girl has no outlet for her sexy fantasies. ""G"" is her older drug dealing boyfriend, who is as cold as your ice box! What a pair! After reading half of this book I knew how this story would end. Never the less I did finish the book and was satisfied with the ending."
4,Read in a day,I read this book years ago...lend it out and NEVER it got back....But I put a lot of my friends and fam onto this book. I thought it was GOOD!
4,Good,This book was overall a good book. It did start off slowin the beginning but once it starts rolling you are hooked from that point on.
3,Just Okay,"This book was highly recommended by friends, but for me it just wasn't great. The plot seemed decent but I wanted more. Juicy was young and needed to be sexed good so badly that she became reckless. G was a pain in the ass and a woman beater. I did like Gino's character. This was definitely an urban tale, but with erotica I am used to more sex scenes."
1,stop the madness,this book is complete garbage I purchased this book based on ur comments...this will never happen again this book is only readible if your iq is under 90 oh my GOD !!!!
3,My take on G-Spot,I thought this book was going to be much better. It wasnt what i expected but it was a gud read.
4,THIS BOOK WAS VERY GOOD,I LOVED THIS STORY - IT COMPLETELY KEPT MY INTEREST AND THE STORY LINE WAS FANTASTIC IT WAS GOOD LIKE THE COLDEST WINTER EVER BUT IT WAS A LITTLE UNBELIEVABLE THATS WHY I GAVE IT FOUR STARS INSTEAD OF FIVEI RECCOMEND THIS BOOK IT IS A GOOD READ THAT WILL BE HARD TO PUT DOWN!
5,"Nice tumblers, nice feature!","These tumblers came with a feature I wasn't expecting: the lid has an opening for a straw, making them great for kids as well as taking along in the car. Very nice!"
4,Nice light,"I've had a number of lights that are as bright, but run on cheaper batteries. It is a nice light, with several good features. I would say you probably get your moneys worth. If you don't mind paying the extra money for the batteries."
4,Melanie's stateside fans missed a gem,"While there are a few retreads here, overall this European release from 1995 is a winner. Melanie's voice has matured, much like a fine wine. The cuts vary from folk to rock to country and even a little dance beat on the reworking of ""Beautiful People"" and Melanie's cover of ""I Will Survive."" It's too bad that Melanie has been ignored by the mainstream labels; she is a vastly underrated singer and songwriter. Those who are old fans will enjoy this collection. And if you are new to Melanie, this CD is a fine introduction. Give it a listen."
4,Hard to be perfect,"some albums are not so good some are brilliant but you cannot judge a singer with a over 35 years in the business do a number one album each time,no one can do,but is one thing that Melanie does is she sang with passion,and for this album Old Bitch Warrior,has some geat song,Something Warm is my favorite cause she sang it with force...I'd like to tell you that you're beautiful;she does make my hair stand,I don't know how to say that to someone and I wish I could just like that and make their hair stand on the back of their necks"
1,Horrible!,"I really don't get the point of this cd, does it contain music? Well, it must, there is some type of noise on it. Does it contain singing? I suppose because I hear someone growling in the background. Maybe I bought this as a mistake, hope the store takes it back, if not I can use it as a frisbee,"
3,"A ""light"" film of the British victory over Argentina",No indepth analysis or perspective of this battle. I enjoyed it as a compilation of British newsreels of their victory. It didn't show the true nature of the conflict. Worth seeing for anyone who wants to see footage of the battle.
2,A British based perspective of the Falkland Islands War,"A British based perspective of the Falkland Islands War, following their deployment from the time they leave the UK until their return. Film footage is a collection of takes by British civilian and military newsmen. Unfortunately, there is little or no analysis of the war, and there is no mention of the significant tactical and strategic consequences resulting from this encounter. It is essentially a 110 minute British military PR film, glossing over battles so that smiling faces could be shown to the people back home."
3,Cute,"The concept of this book was wonderful - Louisa May Alcott, a detective? How exciting. I did enjoy this book, but on a very shallow level - the whole thing was very prettily written but without a very intriguing amount of content.This was a charming little read, but it didn't blow my skirt up. Good light reading."
5,Charming Historical Mystery,"Journey back to Boston circa 1887 for a historical mystery starring Louisa May Alcott before she became famous. As a budding writer, Louisa has an observant nature, so when her friend Dot is late for a tea party and arrives in a disheveled state, Louisa's suspicions are raised. Everyone wonders why Dottie married Preston Wortham, especially so Dottie's wealthy family. So when Dot is found dead by the wharf, it's no surprise that Constable Cobban suspects the victim's husband of being a fortune-hunter. Afraid the officer of the law might not look any further than the obvious, Louisa determines to unmask the killer. It appears all of Dottie's relatives have something to hide, and a few near misses on her life tell our heroine that she's getting closer to the truth.This is a delightful debut for a new series. I look forward to reading more about Miss Alcott's exploits in the sequel, Louisa and the Country Bachelor."
4,Boston 1850s,"This first book in a projected series gives us Louisa May Alcott who in her old age looks back to a ""secret"" part of her life, her ""adventures...in the curious role of a lady detective."" Not yet a well known author, Louisa willingly sets forth from the protective bosom of her hard working, loving family in order to discover who murdered her childhood friend. In the process, her own life is threatened.Although the story is not particularly fast moving, it provides rich details about the required manners and dress of ""respectable"" Boston women. Find also bits of information about social issues in pre-Civil War New England, of Louisa's father, Bronson Alcott, and of Henry Thoreau, Ralph Emerson and Margaret Fuller."
4,Very funny...,this book is hysterical. we found it one night while on a dig in scotland and it passed the time at night very nicely. full of jokes about field workers and interesting shirt slogans. great to bring if your going to be with new people to break the ice
4,Great learning,"In order to appreciate this movie, you have to know that the whole Onmyoji story is not just written by someone for thistime. It is based on a true story(!) in 8th Century Japan.The charactors and stories are from the one of the oldest records written in Japanese. Those guys were existed then, doing those miracles in daily life.It is so interesting to learn about Japanese beliefs and religious activities in old times, which lead us to understand what the bases of them today.Also, you should know that the main actor is a ""prince"" of ""NOH Dance"" which is one of the most ancient art forms in Japan.This is why his movment is not at all like other actors but with a special NOH technique.Overall, this is really a great Japanese movie. Should be more introduced to foreign countries since it represents depth and difference of their culture."
5,Fantastic!,"This movie is absolutely fantastic! The main character (Abe no Seimei) is an amusing fellow and his counterpart (young Hiromasa) is just as funny to watch. I love all of the Buddhist symbols in this movie, hidden and in plain sight. This film is one of the best Japanese films I have ever seen!"
5,"Perfect ""Movie Night"" Film","If you're looking for a night on the couch with a big bowl of popcorn being passed around friends, this is the movie to pick. This film is for people who tire of Hollywood's predictable movies, remakes, and prequils with ""top actors"" who can only do one character. Between the demons and the famous Japanese singer-turned actor reside the funniest, most dramatic, most awkward glances you've been craving. Just when you think this film can't get any better, it does. I won't ruin anything for you *cough cough MERMAID?!* It's like Kung Pow Enter the Fist, except this film doesn't know how ridiculous it really is.Hint: Do not watch this movie alone. It's a more enjoyable experience if you're an audience member. Watch it with all your friends (except that one dood who broke his funny bone)."
3,Crazy movie,"I had to watch the movie in parts as I got bored, but I have to finish once I start! Crazy story line and just silly special effects. Glad I didn't pay a lot of money for this movie."
5,Excellent,"A handsome collection of childhood songs! This is like being within those times. Amazing is the word for it as if it were sports, all artists would be in the Hall of Fame!"
2,music,"Was not what I believed I ordered was looking for soul Christmas album which this was not, too much soul for me!"
4,Beautiful!,"This is a great companion book for the movie. The pictures are bright and clear! I wish it gave more background and trivia on the making of the movie, but what it has is great!"
4,Interesting read,"I thought this book was an interesting read. It probably is more for the fan of the movie than a fan of the stage play, as the history of the developement of the musical is told in relation to the birth of the movie. I especially liked the full screenplay, as there was a few parts of dialogue/lyrics in the movie that I didn't understand. There are also some lovely full page stills of the movie and behind the scenes shots."
5,A Whole Movie In One Book,"This book contains all of the dialogue to the movie and has beautiful, colorful pictures of each scene. And for all of you lovers of the stage version of Phantom, in the beginning of the book, it has pictures from the stage version and some info. on that. I own the soundtrack to the movie and whenever I want to sing Masquerade, I always look in the book for the words. It's useful and makes for great reading."
4,For the Phantom Fan,"This book to me is a must have for any die hard Phantom fan.It is interesting to read the screenplay and how the Phantom of the Opera became the broadway hit and then the movie. There is something in this book for everyone. It summarizes everything nicely.And for me, it was helpful to see the lyrics as there have always been one or two words in the songs that I was unable to understand."
4,Great for fans of the movie!,This book makes a great companion for those who love the movie. The pictures are wonderful and the screenplay (as mentioned before) add detail to better appreciate the movie.FYI for Silverpen: the cover photo is not really flipped -- it is a view in the mirror.
5,"If You Love POTO, You'll Love This Book!","Includes history of the original novel, some info on the Broadway production, and of course, the making of the movie. It also includes the script of the movie (although, for some reason, the movie doesn't follow the script exactly). The book was worth it for me!"
2,very disappointing,I read this book and was very disappointed in that it did not cover ONLY the movie version of the Phantom. I was not interested in anything about the stage version that was in the book. Considering the price the book should have been larger. I also thought there should be more pictures of the Phantom who is the true star of the film.
5,"Great unit, lots of plugs","Although it is a bit expensive, it has served its purpose well. No power switch means you can't accidently turn it off. There are two differnt type of plugs for your 208 - 240V needs. It is a Tripp-lite...what else needs to be said? :)"
2,My AP US History book,"Online the website described the book as acceptable, however when I got the book there was more damage than you were led on to believe. It said that the top corner was bent. When I got it the to corner was bent...the back corner was ripping off, and there were creases all over the cover. I needed the book, but is that what you consider acceptable?"
4,Good book - no answer keys,"Using this now to prepare for the APUSH in May. Just be aware that unlike other AP prep books there are no answers included!However, if you're a homeschooling parent you can contact the publishers and obtain the answer keys for about $6+shipping. YOU HAVE TO PROVE YOU'RE HOMESCHOOLING or that you're a teacher. For those of you at schools - make sure you get your teachers to check your work."
5,I would give it a 6 if possible,Excellent! This is the official study guide at my academy. The paper quality is very good. There are sufficient informations as well as visual aid. It is very well organized. There is no answer to the practice test though or the review questions at the end of each chapter. I think you have to get it through publisher or something.
5,Great,Great for an AP us history student to study with. BUY FROM AMSCO (the publisher)! It's $17 from there and it's new. Don't get ripped off.
5,Great resource!,We got this for our son when he was in AP-US to prep for the exam. He did a great job on the on the exam.
2,OUTDATED!!,I did not use this book because it turns out it was too old ! I was not satisfied with the quality and I do not recommend it. There is a latest version that you can buy for like 2 dollars more. I had to buy both books so please be aware that this may not be what your teacher wants. Mine is sitting at the end of my locker because it is outdated!
1,Newman book,"the book said used, but it had no pictures of how badly it was used, so when i got it i just threw it away"
1,"Bad conditions, DON'T BUY IT","I found that the book was not the condition as described, it's old and at least a half of the contents was highlighted, some pages has been painted, I did upset what I received. When I requested a return, they rejected it and said it's a Acceptable condition as described. However, the description never show ""some pages covered some contents of the book that CANNOT be seen clearly."
5,GREAT HELP,Really great study book...reads very easy and actually and interesting reading for US History! This one has got to be the best available....and get the flash cards also for an even better way to review!
3,it's great!,"i actually love this review book...my teachers get so many of their test questions from here, and it helps so much with studying. it doesn't have as much unnecessary information as the text book, which is also rather awesome. my only problem is that when i bought mine used, it was much more used than i'd have liked it to have been. it was just unexpected...the seller should've mentioned the fact that there was a heavy amount of underlining and hi-lighting in the product description. but the content of the product itself is perfect!"
4,APUSH US history book,i used this book for my AP US history class in high school and this book was helpful to me in studying for essays tests dates and amendments. the book has all of the amendments and the constitution and the preamble. remarkable.
4,I got a 4,"My teacher didn't get beyond chapter 5 in the American Pagaent? 13th ed..Ehh well... I should have started sooner, but I crammed at the last minute and got a ""4."" I doubt I would have got that if it wasn't for this book! I am giving this 4 stars because I received a 4."
4,Fantastic APUSH Supplement,"I purchased this book on the recommendation of my AP US History teacher. She recommended it as the best supplement book to use when preparing for the AP US History test in May (March? I know it's one of the M months...). So far the book has been extremely useful, providing helpful details that my textbook leaves out. It has greatly increased my knowledge and understanding on the chapters we have covered, and the practice tests and DBQ/FRQ's are very helpful.I do not recommend using it as the only resource, however, because it is a SUPPLEMENT and only that. A standardized textbook gives a better description of some of the events and people, while the AMSCO book can only do so much in the number of pages it contains. It is a fantastic supplement, but should be used along with another book."
5,The best hummingbird feeder I've used yet,"I have had this in use for about 3 weeks now. The hummingbirds seem to like it, they either hover or hang out on the perch to use it. It is as easy to clean as they state, which was my main reason for buying this style feeder. The red top snaps off and it is easy to clean both halves, and they even provide a special little brush to clean in where the hummingbirds get the nectar. It doesn't get messy and drippy like the gravity feeders, and the moat seems to be doing a good job - no ants in the nectar so far.I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for an easy to clean feeder."
2,Well built but doesn't work? Birds prefer my flowers.,"I'm not sure if this is the fault of the feeder, but the birds in my yard refuse to drink out of this thing. I have many flowers in my yard, they just ignore this thing and go straight for the flowers. I tried placing it near flowers. I even tried placing flowers on it. They just totally ignore it as if it's not there.I put the proper mix of sugar/water and everything. I guess this only works if you have no flowers in your yard."
1,Leaky Feeder,"I find this feeder to be really messy. This is my second disk hummingbird feeder, the previous one being a Perky Pets product that I had to replace since the threads stripped on the hanger rod after so many years. I wanted a disk feeder to use with our heater during ice storms and thought Droll Yankees would be a good choice since the Perky Pet product was too large for my hummingbird population. It has not worked out. There is a rim on the bottom in the middle (for screwing onto a ground post) that causes the disk to be unstable when you are filling and placing the top on. And, be sure you don't let the nectar in the feeder slosh around unless you feel like cleaning up the trail of sugar drops left behind from the kitchen to the feeder sight and on your shoes. I have tried not filling it too full (not an issue with my previous feeder) with no effective results. If you buy this feeder, be sure and bring your wet towel with you for mopping!"
5,How to enjoy our trip ! Maybe like this.,"It would be a wonderful text book for real travelers. I have reminded my trips only for relaxing with my wife. It shows different sides of world we have not experinced. Also, it could be a beautiful text book for parents. I believe her children have learned many ways of life through their travel with parent. It should be most important and valueble estate which parent can give for their children through their life."
3,nice but not many bendable parts,"This is a nice item, but you can't get it into many different poses since the legs and arms aren't fully bendable."
4,Great Deal~~Wonderful Markers,"What a great deal! Thanks amazon ..all 3 of my kiddos ages 2,5,8 are getting great use from the markers :)"
2,Meh,"These are just so-so. I bought these for my daughter over the summer and they are already drying out and not really that colorful on the paper anymore, even though I'm adamant about putting the caps on tightly after use. I would stick with the old school thick Crayola markers, as those seem to last longer."
1,Not particularly washable.,"I purchased these markers at the local grocery store, wanting to increase my children's color choices for markers. Because I had them in my hand, I saw that there were only 5 scented markers, so that wasn't a problem. We have several sets of Crayola's broad tip washable markers. When my 3 year old used them on the coffee table and made a few marks off the paper, I thought, no problem Crayola's washable markers always come off. Not this time- after several washings, the marks are still there."
4,Works for us,"My son is 16 months old. He recently became very interested in pens. Enjoys opening pens and putting the caps back by himself. Since ball pens and regular markers in our house leave stain on his hands and clothes, I searched for washable and non-toxic markers. These markers are exactly what we were looking for. I like the fact that they are washable and non-toxic. And work for my son."
3,Deceptive,"Not all 20 markers have a Silly Scent. Only 4 or 5 have a fruity smell, the rest smell like regular markers."
2,Don't buy this book if you want to raise your TOEFL score!,"This book shows you what the TOEFL is llike, but it will NOT give you any deep preparation. It does not even come close to preparing you for all the material you will see on the TOEFL. The grammar is too easy, the listening section is mostly just a list of idioms, and some of the reading passages are about topics that TOEFL does NOT put on their tests.You might think this is a good book because it is long, but don't think that! Most of the book consists of practice tests--Princeton Review puts one question on each page (trying to simulate what the computer will look like). For example, the last 150 pages of the book are ONE test.Finally, the CD-ROM is NOT a Computer Test. You will get only some listening practice.Good luck on your TOEFL!"
1,Princeton Review -- cracking your computer,"If you were looking for a real Y2K bug here is one: its drill test program contains a bad Y2K bug that forces you to change your computer setting and also manually change the settings in some test-record files, otherwise it would keep cracking your machine. Frustrating, really. And if you use a computer with the ""regional setting"" greyed out you would not be able to run the CBT drills. NT users, also please forget it."
3,Please HELP me,"Hey bro, I'm looking for this books's address. Actually, I wanna buy this book. But I've no credit card to make money. Moreover, I live in Bangladesh. So there is no possibility to get this book by cash. Would you pl help me by giving me the e-mail/mailing address, where I can communicate directly and make money by sending bankdraft. I'll be ever grateful to you. Please help me. Here my e-mail address: <haque@abnetbd.com>"
1,Large black band broke during my third use,"During my third use the large black band for bicep curls the band broke. The attachment was still intact, the band itself sheared."
5,POSTMODERN GNOSTICISM,"In this book Cioran continues to devalop his peculiar philosophy of despair. He focuses here on human obsession with history. He somewhat confirms Joyce's vision of history as a nightmare from which one wants to awake. He also knows that Utopia is - in translation from its Latin origin -a place that is nowhere. Once more Cioran is great. One more must-read for all fans of ""Tears and Saints"" and ""Anathemas and Adirations"""
1,Don't waste your hard earned money. UNRELIABLE!,"I purchased this emachines through Best Buy 1 1/2 yrs ago. I have had many computers in my lifetime and this one has been the most disappointing to me. The motherboard shorted out/blew the other day and now I am left with a piece of junk. After talking to many people I work with, I find out I am not the only one with issues exactly as this one. Now I am completely out of luck and the $500 I spent! I will never purchase an emachines again! Yesterday, I ordered a Dell, let's see how that one behaves!Luckily, customer service is nice, but they didn't fix this computer!"
4,Light in the Piazza,"This is one of my favorites. A mother visits Italy with her grown mentally challenged daughter. Due to a riding accicdent her daughter is a perpetual child in a woman's body. Enter a young Italian man who is captivated by the daughter's beauty and innocence. At first the mother discourages the romance, but she is conflicted. She has always hoped that her daughter will overcome her disability to live a full and ""normal"" life. Eventually, she gives in, but will she tell the Italian family why her daughter is so innocent and naive?"
3,Movie good... picture Quality not so good...,"The best on this movie are Olivia De Havilland and Yvette Mimieux and the wonderful location of Firenze e Roma.the Story is wonderful and Yvette Mimieux plays her part wonderful.Well, I like very much George Hamilton.. but here I'm disappointed of his acting. With his suits he wear he looks to much american and his acting as an italian young man is terrible.DVD: the Picture quality is not so good in any few scenes but acceptable.Subtitles: nonebonus: noneTrivia: on a point when Mrs. Johnson crossing the street befor she enter the consulate, we can see clearly people where watching the filming.Movie gets: 4 starsGeorge Hamilton: 3 starsDVD: 3 stars"
3,Very enjoyable movie,Good acting and character development. Thoughtful plot. Nice shots of Florence. Yvette Mimieux was always one of my favourites. Not a fan of George Hamilton.
4,Really good film,"Nostalgia: saw it when it was released. Appealing performances, some by actors with long established careers and others just starting out; great location (Florence,) unusual theme."
2,Gabriela Garcia Marquez-el otono del patriarca,"I love Garcia Marquez, he is one of my favorite writers, although I did not like el otono del patriarca. It is heavy, complicated, has no coherence. I hated it."
5,FANTASTIC!,"I absoultely LOVE this shoe. I wish now I had bought in multiple colors instead of just the one as they are no longer available. It fits well, looks great and one of the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn."
5,Microwave cookbook,"This is an excellent reference book that every kitchen should have. It is my ""cooking bible"" that I use virtually every day since my wife died."
5,glad to find the copy,when I received my first microwave this book came with it . It has been used very much and became tattered and the cover came off. When I saw I could purchase one I was elated. It is in good shape and will last longer than I will.
3,Different Cover,"The book I received has a different cover. Instead of the back of what looks like a princess, it is the side of a man with long gray hair and a beard, feeding a deer. THe castle and trees are the almost the same, and he's wearing a similar red robe. This isn't really a problem, but thought I would point it out, that there may be an error, or a second edition, or something else that's inconsistent."
4,What happened to the colour?,"Great story, but am I missing something? These illustrations would have been terrific if some of them at least were in colour, not just the touched up cover ones. Even sharp black and white instead dull midtone grey would have made a major difference."
2,only if you are a huge fan,"Forget it. I'm a big fan of FB & the Pixies, but this has got 'contractual obligation' written all over it. A pretty ordinary quality recording and the music is pretty lacklustre. I have every Pixies / FB album, including singles, and this is by far the worst. Only get if you have to complete your collection, and even then, don't expect much."
2,"Class was good, material average",Just your average case book. Nothing really to show here. I'm sure there are multiple volumes and editions. I used this book 5 years ago.
5,Wonder Pets Do It Again!,"Not only has this become my granddaughter's (almost 3) new favorite DVD, but it is also mine. There are funny and adorable subtilities which an adult ""gets""...perhaps the child does, or not...but it is high quality entertainment, a good introduction to the music of The Nutcracker, and, as usual, full of excellent morals and lessons without being preachy. I LOVE THE WONDER PETS!"
3,For selective chewers,"It is a solid product, but only for some dogs. My Golden Retriever won't touch it. The only thing he likes about it is watching me spin the jack. Another dislike is that you do not get to choice the color jack you want."
3,Not what I expected,"I was surprised at the contents of this calendar! I had expected to find one month with Walt Disney, another with Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes in Demolition Man, and so on..."
1,What was it Dorothy Parker said?,"A Murder in Mayfair: Coincidences way, way beyond believability. Character development almost nonexistent. A denouement that left me gasping at its ineptitude. What did Dorothy Parker say? ""This is not a book to be put aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force."""
3,The master nods,"Everything Barnard writes under his own name is worth reading, and this one is no exception. His weaker mysteries are better than 99% of the stuff being published. Still, Murder in Mayfair reads like it isn't quite finished. There are long static scenes of dialogue and one unbelievable coincidence (involving the location of two flats) that makes no difference to the plot. The resolution is not a surprise and, worse yet, relies on a deus ex machina. It reads a bit like a draft rather than a finished novel.Read Barnard's other political mysteries -- Scandal in Belgravia and Political Suicide -- first, and then this one."
2,better choices than this,"If you are drawn to cleverness, intellectual excessiveness, and a confounding ability to make the simple seem hopelessly complicated, then this book is for you!!!Otherwise try ""I Am That"" or ""The Science of Enlightenment"", both of which will take you down the rabbit hole of non-duality/Advaita with grace, charm and simplicity."
5,"Surprising, technical, accurate","When awakening happens, life reveals surprising things, disturbing things. Wei Wu Wei (pen name of a European guy) explains in circles what cannot be explained. Whether you already realized or not, read this book. And prepare some aspirin. Lots of it. Or maybe you will laugh at the attempt ? It's up to you. Or maybe not ;).Namaste"
2,I'm a bit disappointed,"I bought this after hearing that Wei Wu Wei gave the clearest description of Non Duality. This book is way too complex to be any fun to read. I have loved Nathan Gill and Tony Parsons etc, but this one is an excercisein little used language by folks that consider themselves ""the intelligencia"" of spiritual madness. Even after 30 years of spiritual study, I found it frustrating. After reading two chapters, it is on a shelf waiting to be donated to good will."
5,Great toy!,"I gave my daughter this for Christmas, and out of about 100 toys that she got, she repeatedly claimed that this was her favorite present. Great size for carrying and a great range of motion and buttons which kids love. Too bad she's lost it now and I'm desperately trying to find another one for sale."
1,Doesn't Work,"This was sold as a ""partner"" to the Sony Vaio AC Adapter. It doesn't even fit with the adapter as a three prong cord is needed and this is a two prong. It is a good, cheap cord but should not have been advertised as a good extension for the Sony Vaio AC Adapter."
1,BAD - NOT RECOMMENDED,"i used it not more than 2 months and the cable just broke off. totally not recommended.the copper cable inside is a thin and cheap one, it is not strong enough and make it easy to broke off. don't but this item, not worth even for a cheap price. wasting time and energy searching it."
1,how could you get this wrong?,"I never dreamed a power cord sold in the United States could be so bad.The tines at the power-outlet end of the cable are too thin. The cord doesn't stay plugged into the wall. If that's wrong, I wonder what else could be wrong with it. It shouldn't be rocket science, folks.On close examination, the tines are about 2/3 the thickness of those on any of the other power adapters in my cube, measuring ~1mm, vs the ~1.5mm thickness of the plug tines on nearly every other electrical device sold for use in North America."
3,Can't beat the price,"I purchased one of these to replace a nonworking one on my power brick. Unfortunately, the plastic ""figure 8"" that covers the plug broke off after a couple months leaving two metal 120V prongs uncovered. As of right now, I'm chalking this up to a fluke (since no one else has reported any issues) and reordering the same cable. Even if the cable is a little more brittle, it's so daggum inexpensive that it makes it worth it. Here's to better luck with my second one."
3,"Works, But the Picture is Deceptive","Although the picture clearly shows a polarized plug, this item has a non-polarized plug. Even the Cables Unlimited website has the same deceptive picture for this item. Still works for many applications, but beware if your application requires a polarized plug, because this cord does not have one. After researching the matter I understand why. The figure-8 plug (IEC C7) is by definition an non-polarized connector. A polarized power cord would have an asymmetrical (IEC C7-PW) plug."
1,Dead Cord,Lost my old cord. I purchased this item on 1/13/2012. It died on 1/31/2012. Enough said. Before it died I loved it... It was longer than the one that I lost.
3,"Some good, some bad...","Ordered 2pcs. received 2 different cables. One is good quality, one is very weak with small power plug. Works, but cheap.If both would have been like the good one, I would have given 5 stars."
4,satisfying purchase,I did get what I ordered in a timely manner. I was informed all along about the tracking of my purchase. The price was good and the item was in good shape. Will probably purchase from this seller.
2,"Cable was advertised as 6', what arrived was less than 5' by several inches.","If you want a 4'8"" cable this cable is fine. IT IS NOT 6' LONG. IT IS NOT 5' LONG. It is ~4' 8"" long."
2,wrong item,"THey sent me the wrong item, I requested the right one, and a pp for the old. I got the right but no pp for the old or disposition of the old. Otherwise it worked OK."
4,I got it as a backup,"I got this as a backup for a new computer I recently bought. It works great for what I need, but I won't use it much unless my other cable gets messed up."
3,Excellent for Northwest gardeners,"If you want to identify native plants, get an Audubon guide. If you want to grow them, get this book. It discusses cultivation methods; soils and other environmental factors; where in the region specific plants will live; where to find (and where NOT to get) plants, seeds, and cuttings; what sorts of insects and diseases harm our native plants; etc. Good reference for any Northwest gardener from Oregon through BC, whether you're east or west of the Cascades. Some historical uses for specific plants (culinary, medicinal, etc.) are also briefly given. The book's real drawbacks are its lack of color pictures (there are very few), and its sometimes slightly erroneous descriptions. I suggest coupling this book on growing native plants with a good Audubon guide if you're trying to identify what plants are growing wild on your land."
4,not a picture book,"A nice introduction (and more) to native plants of the Pacific Northwest. My only criticism about it is that it doesn't have great photos. I bought this book to give me an intro to plants in that area, as I'm designing a garden for a friend. This book doesn't give much sense of what the plants look like in a garden. I'll have to go there. It's comparable to Judith Phillip's book Southwestern Landscaping with Native Plants (for, obviously, a different part of the country)."
2,1980's revisited!,"I recently purchased this dvd. I was thinking about going to either Mallorca or the Canary Islands next year. This dvd was informative but it is very outdated. It says 2000, but the film was done back in the 1980's. The sound quality is not very good and it looks like they transferred the film from a vhs tape. I kept the dvd just because there is some good information, and it does cover the different Canary Islands."
4,Pretty good,"The 2 seperate compartments is a good feature on this low cost bag. I use it for my hair products. I keep the products in the main pouch and the Combs in the side pouch. The only thing to consider is the size, if you plan on using this as your only bag for bathroom/shower supplies, it may be too small."
3,Not one of the best...not one of the worst,I'm a bit picky when it comes to my books. This was entertaining but I've read better! I did like that there were a lot of different stories. Helps to appeal to the mood you are in at the time you are reading it.
2,"a little disappointing, why real bookstores are better than online","This book is a little disappointing, a good example of why real bookstores are better than online shopping when you're not sure what kind of book you want. Had I been paging through this volume at a real bookstore, I probably never would have spent the money and shipping on it. There are a ton of sexy stories, but really many of the same type, sort of old English bodice-rippers, which if you read Marquis de Sade or Fanny Hill, you're not going to be very impressed. Also, there were no names of authors or other interesting literary information to frame the works contextually. I guess what I'm saying is that you can have my copy if you want."
3,Tracks 17 and 18 corrupted,"I really like these albums as they have classic songs. I was happy to see them available in MP3. However, there are two tracks that do have a ""clicking"" on them which ruin the end of one song and the beginning of the next one.The end of track 17 (Father Of Lights), starting around 2:41, the ""clicking"" starts and continues into about the first 10 seconds of track 18 (Praise Ye The Lord). And they're two of my favorite tracks.I've spoken to Amazon and they'll eventually, they said, pull them off the site once they've confirmed the problem. I talked to their MP3 support on 8/20. They also said it may take months to get the new ""clean"" copies from the publisher. They'll put them back once clean copies are obtained.I just wanted to make any future buyers aware of this issue. The 3 stars I gave are due to the product and the inconveniece this has caused and does not reflect the content of the albums which I really like."
5,Awesome Album Art!,"I really like the cover on this album. The anchor-torpedoes racing down to earth. Even if this album art is'nt original,which I think it is; It's awesome because of other worlds' that just might be our friends. Willing to fight for our safety for those who respect our creator, God."
3,Never say die,This Cd is two different Albms Never Say Die & Washes Whiter than. The never say die part of the Album is great rock but the other Album does noes not rock at all It is not good at all. buy iot for the first half of the cd.
5,"I read Hedda Gabler, I think.","I read Hedda Gabler in high school and it was about a woman from Finland, or Denmark. She was an old woman, or maybe middle aged. She wore a kerchief and wooden shoes and was very sad about something. It was written by a guy named Soren Kierkegard who is a famous author. The book has real characters that held your interest, but it was so long ago that I can't remember what they did, or what they talked about. It was in English because someone had translated it from Danish, or Finnish..."
2,I read 500 pages of bore to get to 16 pages of meat,"I have been intrigued by American Empire and its ascent over the last century. I wanted to read Mr. Rockefeller's words for myself. It seemed as though he was skipping major details throughout- for example he glides right over the death of his brother Nelson, leaving out details of the circumstance. Which pretty much proved to me that the rumors were more than true.Chapter 27 was what I was hunting and in his own words on page 405 he solidifies accusations of his one-world agenda. Considering he has been a part of the Bilderbergs, CFR, and Trilaterals for most of his adult life- rather odd he only gives about a page a piece to each issue. A 500 page book and only 1 brief chapter on the bulk of his world vision. Dare I say conspiracy?"
2,Fluff piece,"Most of this book is just a fluff piece that tries to spin a good light on a criminal family. After reading this though, some things are very obvious. John D tried to take over the oil industry and now David wants to take over the world. Seeing how he and his mega banker good ole boy network of Bilderburgers have wrecked the US economy, he may well do it."
4,"Modest, brilliant and isolated man",The David Rockefeller story is a poignant recollection of an age gone by; but it is an invaluable and accurate recollection of the facts of his remarkable family and his unique time on the public scene
2,"Worth the money, but not much more.","It's a jack, and it lifts. That's about all I have to say about it.It's nice that they include a port to add hydraulic oil to the jack, because I tied it down on its side behind the back seat of my truck, and within two weeks it leaked about half the hydraulic oil out - luckily into a plastic container and not on my carpet."
5,One of the best salsa concerts in history ...,"Its one of the best, this Celia Cruz performance in Africa with the fania all stars its what salsa lovers want, not too many people know about salsa and their best singers , but to let everyone know this group of musicians were the top guys in the business and the chorus include the best salsa singer ever ... HECTOR LAVOE, all of them enter to the fania by Willie Colon and the great musician and composer (the producer of the fania) Johnny Pacheco. For those who doesnt know about Celia Cruz , one of this two guys found her performing in a bar and they need her to work a duo and there she is , the Queen of salsa and the Kings , all these guys are puertorricans except for Johnny and Celia , buy it so you can learn more about the best times in salsa in Africa ..."
1,Celia Cruz fans BEWARE! Very Disappointing!,"So, you see this DVD title, and the title says, ""CELIA CRUZ - Quantanamera"". What do you expect to see? A DVD of Celia performing, right? HA! There are 7 tracks on this DVD, and of those 7, Celia Cruz is only on 2. TWO! Very Misleading! Whomever marketed this title should not have been so deceptive, but rather call it what it is: A salsa musical concert that features the talents of some of the Fania All Stars (with Johnny Pacheco). Not only are Celia fans being deceived, but Johnny Pacheco fans are missing out; looking at the title or front cover of this title, you would never guess Johnny was on over three-fourths of this DVD. Celia AS ALWAYS is flawless & gives a TERRIFIC performance with the 2 songs she does sing. I should've known something was astray when Celia's signature song, ""Guantanamera"" is misspelled in the title as ""Quantanamera""."
4,"Gripping, but incomplete","Gripping documentary--not a feature film--for viewers who have had significant life experience; it may be a bit slow for some others.Some subsidiary facts, like that Hahn's first lover Pepi eventually did marry and did not remain a mama's boy, or that her husband Vetter believed racial-purity dogma to his dying day, are left out. These must be gleaned from the Internet. It is a disappointment that no extras are offered.Otherwise, an extremely worthwhile film that reminds us again how many amazing stories resulted from the combination of Hitler's insanity and the German psyche."
2,Bad DVD quality,"It is an amazing movie, but the quality of DVD is horrible! Way below any acceptable level. It is painful to watch."
3,Not too bad...,"It's a pretty good book. Being new to this whole ""craze,"" I found it very helpful in determining best prices and gauging what were legitimate ""beanies"" and what were garbage."
4,A Challenging Mystery,"Overall this book is quite good. Its flavor is a tad more subtle than the previous book in the series, and marks the difficult middle ground between the dramatic Emprise and the conclusive Empery. As a yarn, I place it rather high, and Kube-McDowell manages to hold onto his audience in this one, better than say, Inherit the Stars did with its sequel. The story here is quite clever: Humans went to the stars thousands of years ago, but how did they get there, and why did the initial attempts at interstellar travel fail. Good stuff!"
2,Just a collection of reports,"This book manages to say nothing definitive about training, racing, or cycling equipment. It is a nice collection of reports on recent research, but provides little practical information.On another note, the cover looks really cool in my bookshelf!"
4,"Content is excellent, binding not so much",Excellent collection (as stated in the other reviews) but unfortunately not spiral bound... Prepare to either wrestle the book into staying open or to make photocopies of the particular pieces you're interested in.
3,Accuracy of transcriptions,"These transcriptions are not ""identical to the recordings"". They have a long way to go before they achieve that. However they are a magnificent first attempt. For more accuracy, we are just going to have more patience, and listen harder. There are years of work to be done before we can claim 90+ percent accuracy."
4,OFF TO A GREAT START!,"This was a great beginning to the TALES OF THE JEDI saga. It properly followed the story outline provided by Tom Veitch in the end text of DARK EMPIRE number 5 (It's too bad that the future stories strayed from that superb plotline). Some of my favorite scenes involved Satal Keto and Aleema discovering the ancient Sith medallion and unknowingly succombing to the dark side of the force. This was a great set-up to a story that would later be ruined by Kevin J. Anderson's interference. The only reason that I did not give this a five star rating was because a certain character gets his arm sliced off and then hooks a fully functioning droid arm on as an instant on the spot replacement! UGHH! Other than that, you have a really cool story."
4,"Short, but well worth the trouble","Although the bulk of the story happens in the next two books in the Tales of the Jedi series, this is a good setup with enough action to keep you waiting to read Dark Lords of the Sith. Those of you who may be looking for the story of Exar Kun (freed thousands of years later by students of Luke Skywalker) can start reading here, also if you're looking for early tales of Light Side vs. Dark Side, this is a great starting place. But I wouldn't suggest reading this without its sequels."
3,Nomi Sunrider and Ulic Qel-Droma together.,"This TPB comic seems to take place after TALES OF THE JEDI, THE COLLECTION so I am placed it in Timeline year 3998 before NH. Released in dec 1997 we get about the same quality art and coloring as TOTJTC (about a C) but dave dorman did the cover art, and he it great! The story also rates a 3. It has good action and is more tightly written than some of the other Old republic era comics. This one is a worthwhile read, but not as good as Darkhorse will start putting out in the future.The binding on this comic is good and can handle some abuse. Some of the new TPB comic binding since production was moved to China is inferior. I have had a comic fall apart in my hands while reading it."
1,misinterpretation of jain religion,the author basically failed to understand what is jain dharma.neither in digambar or shwetambar it is written that women can't achieve nirvana. digambar word itself says that when you attain nirvana your cloths automatically disappears. that means you reach such a level that you are away from worldly things.shwetambar is a panth which is seperated from digambar because they are not ready to part away with the wealth they have generated over the years.
5,valuable tips,for all that wish to improve the saling skills and achiev better regata performance this book will guide you between the teory and practical. Very good.
5,Sailing Lessons from Buddy,"Many books cover the fundamentals of sailboat racing, but few do it with the charm of Buddy Melges, the Olympic medalist and America's Cup defender from rural Wisconsin. The lessons on tactics and boathandling are all here, interspersed with tales of races won and lost (mostly won) by the author. The book is well organized and clearly written. A short story from Melges' early career touches on the importance of sportsmanship without being preachy. Over the years I have read this book again and again as much for enjoyment as for instruction."
5,Read Smart to Sail Smart,"We just got back from the 2010 Performance Race Week at Steve Colgate's Offshore Sailing School with North U. Bought the book by Buddy Melges looking for something to reinforce all that we learned in Florida. This little book did all of that and showed how a world class sailor takes his skills and the skills of his crew to the next level. There are other authors who offer great insights from their experience on the water, and we are reading them too, but before the season begins we will re-read this book by Buddy Melges one more time. Highly recommend you do too."
3,Made in CHINA!!!,"My Internet search was, ""Half Finger Gloves"" AND ""Made in USA"". The search results included these gloves. I ordered them, and it turns out they were made in CHINA! Shame on ACE HARDWARE for selling out America, and shame on Amazon.com for not listing the country of origin in the product description! As for the product itself; it is exactly what I was looking for, but is made in the wrong country."
5,It's hard to put this book down,"I first read the book about Kathi's life probably at least 20 years ago. It is a book that is hard to put down. I was so drawn to Margaret's story about her relationship with her daughter. It certainly created a new awareness of the brevity of life, and to seize every opportunity to serve the Lord, because tomorrow is not promised. I was very inspired by this story. Excellent reading!"
5,God never makes mistakes,"As dear friends of the Johnson family for many years before Kathi's Homegoing, we were eyewitnesses to the heartache and ultimate blessing God had planned for them. After the accident that took Kathi, Mike and John, young and old came to know the Lord through the testimony left behind by these three young people. Through the years I've read ""Eighteen, No Time To Waste"" dozens of times, and tears fall each time...not for Kathi for I know she is more alive now than ever - but for the awesomeness of God which is made so clear and evident in the book. The story of Kathi's life and death will strengthen your own faith and cause you to reflect upon God's amazing grace. This is a must read."
5,Great Story! Couldn't put it down.,This was a wonderful story to read and a great inspiration. I hope that the way I portray my love for God is evident and that I can influence those around me the way that Kathi's life as well as her tragic death influenced many.
2,Bad design,This cover appears very nice. It looks very sharpe. But the holders for the iPad do not work properly. The device continually comes out.
1,boxwave does not give 30 day money back guarantee,"I wanted to warn customers that boxwave does not honor what they advertise in their website that they give a 30-day money back guarantee. I tried to get an RMA (a form they require so that you can get a refund) as soon as I saw the product in the mail so I can return it and I have not gotten a reply from them. I think their modus is that they make you lose your 30 day window so in the end, they are not obliged to give you the refund. So if you are not sure about the product they are selling, don't buy it! You might end up not liking it and you'll be stuck with it. Also, I think that companies who make false promises should not be patronized. It just shows that they do not practice professionalism."
5,Great product and price!,"I love this case! When I travel with it, I always get compliments and asked where I bought it. The only defect it was is that the snap is on the back which for me seems counter intuitive. I want it on the front.It protects the IPad well. Not once has it falling out or come off the elastic holding it. My two year puts this thing through the ringer placing it on top of water or making scratch marks and it has withstand.Seriously for the price, its a great cover!"
1,Disappointed with condition!!,"OK, this is going to sound like a small thing, but not to my 7-year-old son.He and I looked through all the sidewalk chalk available on Amazon. He specifically wanted a chalk package with a handle (like the one he used to have, before his little sister got hold of it.). Say what you will, but tote-ability is a priority. So he chose this one.In spite of the picture, our item came without the handle. He was really disappointed, but didn't want to send the thing back, and be without his new chalk. I get that.Perhaps more importantly, I don't see a way to contact this seller now that I've received the package and have no idea how to contact them to see if they can just send me out a handle. The only option I saw on Amazon was a review.Here's hoping they read them. I'd love to be able to just add the .04-cent handle to the box my son already has ... and thereby fix the toy he expected."
4,U-Knighted,Bought this set for my daugher. She uses it outside and it has great color and durability. It is a great value compared to what you can buy in a store.
1,Regarding Mr. Burke,"I have not read this book, but was so offended by his racist textbook ""History of England"" that I must ask Mr. Burke: Are you not aware that the ""macho"" males are genetic mutants, attracted to XYY males?. When you give snide endorsement to Edward being thrust with a hot poker, you define a culture of gays and bi-sexual lesbians. I hear that this is what has become of England since my last visit in 1974."
5,Good read,I'm a Jackie Collins fan and found this short story to be a very good read. Fast paced but kept my attention :)
3,One of Collins' two best,"""Lucky,"" along with its prequel, ""Chances,"" are the two best novels that Jackie Collins ever wrote. Collins will never be mistaken for Toni Morrison any time in the near future, but in her day she excelled in the fast-paced glitzy beach read. Of course, as in all of her novels, Collins wastes minimal time with character development and plot lucidity, but when she is on the ball, as she is with ""Lucky"" and ""Chances,"" you're being pulled along so fast you don't really care. Unfortunately, the pop novel has changed, and Collins hasn't. But in her heyday in the mid '80's, no one could touch her."
3,Good While It Lasted,"I purchased this to go as a tag along for my laptop. Wanted to add extra USB hubs. I purchased this about a year ago maybe a little longer and lasted maybe about six months. It just blew out on me a circuit or something. It was still under warranty but I decided not to go through the hassle.(Im sure Targus would have sent me a replacement)The light feature is nice and the four hubs are nicely spaced. It def. is ergonomically designed but that doesn't cut it if it cant LAST! Which was the issue. Other then that it would be a great product. I just been using the three slots I have on my laptop but in the future my purchase another brand due to this just dying on me. If you read other reviews and they sound similar to mine, it shows to avoid this product. Again maybe it was just my hub but it doesnt seem likely. Had similar issue with durability with the Targus Chill Pad. Buy at your own RISK."
2,"Slightly funny, but.....","Anyone who knows ANYTHING about baseball should NOT waste their time on this movie. Bernie was slightly funny at best. Foul-mouthed humor throughout. The plot...VERY predictable. The ending....well, if you know anything about baseball, you'd realize that the ""sacrifice"" would NEVER have happened in the real world. The play would have come to the PLATE because ONE run ENDS the game. So instead of ""sacrificing"" to advance the runner, Bernie would have been given first base on a ""fielder's choice"" and the ball brought home to save the run and prevent the loss. It would have neither been a ""sacrifice"" or a hit. I know I'm diving into technicalities, but my ""suspension of disbelief"" CANNOT get past this one. Big disappointment."
3,Cool,"I'm not really into sports movies, so I may not be a very good reviewer for this one. The movie is about a baseball player (played by Bernie Mac) who is upset that he isn't in the Hall of Fame, but thanks to spiteful media, they find that one of his games was canceled so he now has three more homeruns to make before he can be eligible for the Hall of Fame. Ofcourse there's the usual new I-know-everything players, a bunch of working out, and a love interest (who's a reporter--Angela Bassett) that makes the movie interesting. The movie wasn't bad at all, just not really my thing."
2,Predictable but entertaining,"An enjoyable-enough comedy about a jerk who gets jerked around and reforms. You know the entire plot already and you dislike Bernie immediately, and the pace could have been faster, and the romance is inconsequential, but it's a feel-good misty moment at the end."
4,Not what your expecting,"I think they marketed this movie wrong. It was marketed as a laugh out loud movie, but it's anything but that. It is a chuckle comedy, with slight sly humor, and Mac is so good at it. The comedy is just enough, and not too much, to retain a empathy for the main character and his redemption story, but keeps you light hearted throughout. It's just a great little feel good movie, it delivers just what you want from a movie in it's genre.I really was impressed with the cinematography work in the film, I was not expecting such great atmosphere from a light movie as it is... but the cinematographer , at times, captured the magic of baseball better than I think I've seen it in many great baseball movies.Watch it for what it is, and I think you will really enjoy it."
2,Mr. 3000 isn't a homerun but it isn't a strikeout,"Mr 3000 isn't a ten, but it isn't that bad. Bernie Mac saves the movie and it does get old towards the end. There are few sports comedies that can carry the entire movie, and baseball comedies have been overdone since Bull Durham. Still, if you rent this, or buy it, knowing you are going to get an ok movie then you should like it. The plot is predictable, and you are able to see some of the jokes minutes before they are delivered. Mac does his normal quick talking thing that has made him a star, and the supporting cast are funny even if they are forgettable. Overall, I would say it isn't the best sports movie ever made (Tin Cup), but it isn't Major League IV."
1,Wake Me Up When It's Over,"Last summer, I decided that Superbabies was the worst movie ever made, if not the worst form of human torture ever conceived. Mr. 3000 appeared in theaters shortly thereafter, but (fortunately for me) I wasn't able to see it at the time. Turns out that this flick gives the talking babies a run for the money, which is a shame, since the whole theme of the movie is such a clever idea. This is one of those movies that is embarrassingly unfunny. To make matters worse, I seem to have received a defective copy from Amazon, since it stalled without explanation several times in a rather expensive DVD player. Maybe the player (unlike me) was smart enough to fall asleep."
3,Review of Mr. 3000,"Good movie for baseball fans. A little dated, but what the heck. Good entertainment before the steroid scandals were thought of."
3,"Mr. 2,997","The late lamented Bernie Mac plays Stan Ross, a Milwaukee Brewer who quits the team midseason after attaining his 3000th hit. Ross retires on the strength of his reputation, marketing himself shamelessly as ""Mr. 3000.""Years later, the stats gods discover that Stan is actually 3 hits short of the coveted goal, and the out-of-shape baseball jock returns to the game to hit just one more and one more and one more. Mac is perfectly cast in his role.This is a mildly funny, though entirely formulaic film that doesn't really leave much of an aftertaste, except for its probably unintended critique of how utterly mercenary the present-day game of baseball has become. MR. 3000 is worth watching every now and again just to get a die-hard fan's dander up on that account."
2,One-Time-Movie,"Bernie Mac is a funny character, however the trailer of this movie was better than the actual movie itself, which is why i would refer to is as a ""one-time-movie""."
3,Plesant but predictable,"A nice little sports/date movie about a self centered ball player who is good and knows it to the point that he is royal pain.Classic redemption story of both himself and the prima-donna on the club when he rejoins.Bernie Mac makes the picture and it is worth a watch, don't know if it is worth a buy."
3,Mr. 3000 Barely Makes 3rd Base,"There is nothing really wrong with this movie. Bernie Mac is perfectly cast as Stan, an arrogant retired baseball player who discovers he only hit 2997 runs. His fame is ruined, his pride destroyed. What I didn't care for with this movie is it isn't anything special. Within 5 minutes you know exactly how it was going to end. Also, baseball bores me to tears. For Bernie fans, its worth renting, but is it really worth owning? I know I won't be watching it again anytime soon. Not many laughs either. Sorry Bernie, you have too much talent to do mediocre movies like this one."
2,Ugh.,"Could somebody please find a great movie for Angela Bassett to be in?No, really. She's great and this movie really doesn't do her justice. In fact, it does no one justice.Charles Stone - a great director making bad project choices. You can definitely miss this one unless you want to take one for the team to be sure that Hollywood doesn't ignore ALL African-American led films."
4,Mr 3000 is a good storyline,I like the development of the storyline and how Mr 3000 is able to inspire the teammates that are following in his footsteps
3,Comic Strip Grammar Review,The students I have are Special Education students but I think that the worksheets may be a little too young for my students who are 7th graders. Although I do think that it would be a good resource for teachers with younger students.
2,So-so magnification mirror.,"I have had a long line of suction cup magnifying mirrors...I tend to accidentally leave them in motels when I travel. This one is the worst that I have owned. There is something slightly off to the magnification so you really have to focus and not move to be able to see. Also, it is about an inch smaller in diameter than what I would prefer. On a positive note, the suction cups work great and that is not always the case."
4,A rare jewel...,"This is the kind of travel book that you hope to stumble across! A few years ago,I spent 3 weeks in Paris following the ""Mega-guides"", but falling in love with smaller finds not grand enough for the mega-crowds. This book not only lists my favorite finds, it has a tantalizing list of ones yet to discover. It speaks eloquently of soaking in the ambiance of an overlooked public square or visiting a tiny musuem of an obscure writer. Of course, all of the big attractions are included as well. Written with an understated voice, this is the book I will be taking with me to Paris next month!"
4,I got an A in this guy's class !,"I have to give this book a good review because I got an A in Dr. Lyman Johnson's (the book's co-author with Mark Burkholder) Colonial Latin America class at UNC Charlotte - of course he made us buy this book as the required textbook! Johnson was a fasinating storyteller and quite a funny lecturer, and he really knows his stuff. He's one of the best professors on the UNC-Charlotte faculty.The book is full of information with a simple and concise organization. Latin America's colonial period was long and complex yet simple at the same time, and this book explains it well. The Spanish conquest of Mexico has to be one of the most interesting events in human history.My complaint is that Dr. Johnson was such a joy in the classroom, but the humor and wit did not translate to the book."
4,I wanted to give this five stars... but,"I am impressed and wanted to give this book five stars, but I had one problem. This is an instructional complete with lesson plans. I give it four stars because it provides a very, very, very good foundation for teaching the Wiccan religion to the little ones. It lost that last star of excellence because I object to the format the lessons are given to children. Any parent who interacts with his or her children should purchase this book, but to teach ones children in a structured system such as presented here just is not my thing. In short, GREAT BOOK... just not my own personal style of Raising Witches.So give it a read because it might be your style and even if it is not, it lends itself greatly towards personal adaptation."
3,"Good, but not excellent","Here's the thing with this book: it's VERY Wiccan, which I am not. And she seems to be lacking an editor; I've found at least 10 editing errors just by reading along. I'm not perfect, but I like to think that something I pay money for would be. Also, the lesson plans are incomplete. She just left blank spaces instead of at least stating (N/A) or whatnot. Makes it look like she was in a hurry to get the book published. Also, it's such a small little thing; I really wish there were more in-depth books out there on this subject.Now that THAT'S out of the way... Ashleen's books are very homey and welcoming, even to non-Wiccans. I really like her ideas on family camp-outs and such, since I've been working that into my own for a few years now. That in itself is worthwhile to purchase to book. I wish there was a book dedicated to Pagan camping and festival-going! All in all, It's a nice, quick read for Pagan parents."
3,It's a start....,"This book, personally gives you a push- a jump start to teach the wiccan faith to children. It's a good start, but I thought it would do more of the leg work--- Like a workbook outline for adults.. It has inspired me though to create my own childrens workbook, but I have alot of research ahead of me...I also think someone should be writing out a moon-scouts book for wiccan children!!! I've tried, but I tend to get lost in work and family... Bless'd Be... ^_^ ..."
3,We Are Aliens...Walk by Faith!,"This album starts and finishes with an instrumental track but other tracks are quite good songs. ""Not of This World"" and ""Grave Robber"" are the most famous ones in this album. They are quite good but very peaceful. Greg X Volz has a great but different voice from two other singers Petra has had. The style was more peaceful but still they had such rockin' songs as ""Blinded Eyes"", ""Pied Piper"", ""Lift Him Up"", and ""Not By Sight"". Still, some songs sound too plain for me, like ""Occupy"" and ""Godpleaser"". The next album, ""Beat the System"" was very different from this one...Stars: Grave Robber, Not of This World, Not by Sight"
5,My 2 favorite Petra songs on this CD,"I still have my original Album that I bought back when this was released somewhere, but I just ordered on CD. This has my two favorite Petra songs on it - Bema Seat and GraveRobber. I'm amazed that Bema Seat did not make it onto the greatest hits album. Really can't figure that one out. Anyway, I enjoy many of the other songs as well. I also liked the More Power To Ya album by Petra as well."
4,Jesse [VHS],This movie is out of print and is only available on VHS. A decent Lee Remick film worth watching again. My wife liked it.
2,"Cool pix, but where's the beef?","Lots of cool pictures. I've spent hours looking at them, but I really wanted more info like how I can place a value on matchcovers. Also looked for tips on how to take care of matchcovers, but I didn't see much. I think this stuff is important, so I had to buy another book by someone else. To bad this book doesn't cover that stuff. If you don't care much about reading and just want the pix, the book is OK."
5,Matchcover Widow,"I purchased this book for my husband who is a collector of the old matchbook covers, primarily those that have the striker on the front. He tells me this is an excellent reference book for collectors of matchbook covers. We are both retired so he spends hours a day with this book and his thousands of covers, cataloging and putting them in binders for safe-keeping and viewing."
3,Handy Bag,"I bought this to store my screws, works great, nice wide pockets so you can see in, pull cord closes all pockets with the exception of the outer ones. Handle allows for easy carrying.Only negative - outer pockets need something to keep there mouths closed, elastic, pull string, flap etc."
3,bucket bag,A little small and not very rigid..its ok for small parts but don't over fill it. Its a little shallow
1,Swissco knockoff from China,"I do not write reviews often. But buyers should beware that this is not a genuine Swissco product. I bought this one to replace a genuine Swissco product (made in Germany) and when this arrived found that this is a copycat product that is made in China. The wood is rough around the edges, and the cushion that the pins sit in are not soft. As a result, it feels like you are using a steel yard rake to brush your hair. If I could, I would give this product zero stars."
3,"ok, just not what i was looking for.",Was looking to replace an old Beautique brush I have had for about 15 years. The Beautique's pins/bristles are slightly larger and have a slight ball at tip which helps to keep pin/bristle from scratching scalp. Look continues.........
5,David Meece CD Learning to Trust,"This cd came in the mail immediately, and is in very good condition. I've been looking for it (for my daughter) for ten years. I finally learned how to use the internet!!!"
4,great,mineral is the best emo band i have ever heard... to the guy who was asking up top about bands that sound similar to mineral:Pop Unknown (some members of mineral are in this one)
5,Incredible.,"Incredible, but you all should already know that. I have both of mineral's full lengths, and I am wondering if there is another band out there that is as wonderful as mineral has proven to be. I am completely amazed by how mineral's lyrics and sounds make me feel. I would LOVE to know if anyone out there has any suggestions as to a band that has a similar sound and/or lyrics as impressive as those of mineral. PLEASE let me know if you know of any band like this. Email me at fakeplastic16@yahoo.com. THANK YOU!!!!!"
3,Earnestly trite,"This is a brief step above your generic mid 90's emo, holding at least a few powerfully distorted moments which transcend limited confines, but still comes stacked with overreaching, refried melody and stereotypically frail vocals. Bands like Sunny Day and Cursive do it and do it better, even if those fans are probably the tiny demographic this would only completely work for."
5,Unbelievable,This may be the best album I have ever heard....I love Sunny Day but Mineral is 80 times better....This CD is so...I cannot explain...Each track touches on a different part of life..it's so good.
3,Harimaya Bridge,"Had never heard of this film, but I am so glad I decided to take a chance on it. It was a beautiful film and it was a cinematographic feast. I mean, I watched it a second time right away just to look at the beauty of the scenery. The story is quite an interesting one as well."
5,Good Stuff!!!!!!!!,"I have listened to rap for ages, its good stuff but Kanye, MAN HES AWSOME, if uve ever seen crict's reviews on this album they say that his song ""the new workout plan"" takes the album down BUT MAN THAT IS ONE OF THE BEST SONGS has a real catchy beat and rythm. ALL OF THE TRACKS ARE AWSOME, the skits are funny, and the beats ARE GREAT. This CD is real if u like rap THEN BUY this CD u HAVE TO HAVE IT its a classic. If i could i could give this a 6/5 stars. One of the best CD's ive heard in a long time. Also if u wanna hear a good RnB CD get the Mario Winans ""Hurt No More"" CD its awsome. And if u wanna hear an artist thats gonna be big soon u mite wanna listen to John Legend hes good."
5,About time...Hip Hop has been revived.,"Hip Hop wasnt looking too good until Kanye West ""College Dropout"" CD came out. I was blown away by how the beats didnt sound like Lil Johns last song. Kanye has given Hip Hop what it needs to survive, some awesome beats, some of the most lyrically intelligent lyrics ive ever heard and some positive messages. All of the songs are great on this CD except maybe ""Workout Plan"" but if you listen to it enough, youll wanna listen to it some more. One of my personal favorites is ""Jesus Walks"" which has one of the coolest beats ive heard in a while and great lyrics. Im not a real big religous guy but i enjoyed this song alot. Another great song is ""Spaceship"". When i first saw the title of this song i thought it was a joke but its one my alltime favorite songs. I suggest picking up this CD immediately folks you wont be dissapointed!"
4,Thank God He Quit School,"I'm a woman in her early 30's and I grew up on old school rap in the 80's but after awhile I got tired of the tacky sexist lyrics that took over the airwaves in the late 90's. So, I stopped listening to rap. Fast Forward to 2004 and I hear Jesus Walks on the radio. The song moved me in a way I hadn't felt in a long time listening to a rap song. I went and got the album to see what this young brotha was talking about and I was moved.This whole album is amazing. The cussing is low and the lyrics made sense and told a story. He didn't have too many guest (which is nice because too many rappers can't carry a song without help nowadays) and he wasn't just talking about sex and rims. Overall I would recommend this album to anyone who wants to hear real rap with a meaning"
3,ummmmmmmmm ok,he has so much potential but he does not unleash his talent this album is soooooooo over rated his beats was good but not all of them and he did lack on lyrics
1,Kanye West? Who ?,Is Kanye in here writing these reviews cause everyone has the same reviews using big words to describe his songs like he is greatest thing since Tupac himself...And by the way Slow Jamz is Twista song not Kanye's...The ROC felt pity for you thats why they let you in with Jay Z leaving...
1,YEAH!,"I AGREE! F*CK EDUACATION! WE DON'T NEED ENGLISH TO TEACH US HOW TO PRONOUNCE WORDS! WE CAN SAY ""DAT"" INSTEAD OF ""THAT"" OR BE LIKE NELLY AND SAY ""THURR"" INSTEAD OF ""THERE""! F*CK EDUCATION! THAT'S THE AMERICAN WAY!"
5,"Mayonnaise colored benz, I push Miracle Whips!!!","Kanye's beats are hot. He's made jay-z's beats. Heart of the city. And his lines are hot. The skits are good for a laugh. The final track ""Last Call,"" tells us how Kanye got to where he is now."
3,College Dropout,"When I look at mainstream hip hop these days i am either seeing jumping around telling me exactly how hardcore they are and how much sex they have or a man crying his heart out and telling me how he lost his girlfriend.Then theres Kanye West. Long known as a producer for many hit singles that jay z came out with, kanye decided he wanted to be a rapper and a producer on his album. With many well respected guests such as Talib Kweli, Mos def and Common, kanye pulls of a well produced album while lacking on rhyming skills that will most likely improve as he develops as a rapper. All in all a solid release from the mainstream."
4,Ehhhhh,"Kanye is definetly a skilled artist, but his album is geared toward white people, kinda pisses me off."
3,Not a good lyricist; stick to producing,"Kanye, Kanye , Kanye this album would have been tight if you didn't rap on it at all. He is probably the best producer out right now, I mean, he's a genius when it comes to beats. Now don't get me wrong there is a couple of hot bangin joints on this LP. But lyrically not talented at all. But if you like that non-complex, simple bull than this is the album that is for you."
1,The album is wack- don't buy the hype,"The Wackness is spreading thru hip-hop like the plague used to spread thru Europe. Every few years, an album gets all of the MTV and radio hype and is labeled ""the next big thing in hip-hop"". This is what happened with Kayne; unfortunately for the listener, his music is simply no good, devoid of any skill or lyrical ability. The man, to put it quite bluntly, simply cannot rap and the fact that he has some decent beats cannot compensate for his inability to put more than three or four coherent sentences together. But fear not, my fellow hip-hop heads, Kayne will soon be collecting a welfare check after his 20 minutes of fame are up!"
2,i didnt like it,"I really didnt like this...It is so over hyped it aint even funny..the only songs I was feeling was Through the wire, Jesus Walks, and All falls down..everything else is just ok..and too many skits..it was a little childish..should have been called high school drop out..cause some of the lyrics are childish."
2,"Good Album, 2.5 stars, not classic, don't get confused","I like this album better than most of the commercial rap albums out now, but Kanye's lyricism is nowhere near KRS-ONE's or Rakim's or even Jay-Z' for that matter, he should get off the mic and just produce, I like the messages that he gives but I think even Will Smith has more skills on the mic and he's just as positive as Kanye West is, I like ol' school hip-hop better, but this album is as much of today's hip-hop that I'll listen to 'cause the rest today sucks, if you want some real hip-hop buy ol' school albums."
3,it's a decent album but not best of the year by far,"This albums just alright. It was gassed way to hard by white cats. The beats save the album, but honestly i think he was nicer back in his Blueprint era. I'm really surprised he got all the grammy nods, especially since he's so racially biased. Also i can't believe any of the stuff he says about selling drugs, he's a clown... the only song i really like is we don't care and never let you down, but jay-z really makes that song....i guess people only say this is the album of the year cus all the others were whack, but i'd reccomend ""Purple Haze"" or ""Street's Disciple"" as album of the yr over this"
3,Heh...i really dont see this as classic.,"No doubt Kanye West had a tremendous influence in this years rap scene, some for the better and some for the worst. I dont think his rapping style is new enough or innovative enough to be considered classic yet. his production style is too repetitive and those dam chipmunk noises get on my f---ing nerves! Through The Wire is pretty wack. Come on people. He re-named an old school song with the word WIRE in it?!?! Anyways, as a plus-he raps about the hood and things besides the typical rapper, which is refreshing. He also dresses like a college prep student, even though he is a college dropout. The best song is by far ALL FALLS DOWN. There is a reason why he didnt win best new artist, and yes... Maroon 5 was overrated and shouldnt have won either."
3,Kanye West is the next super producer!,"Kanye is definitely a better producer than he is an mc. His sick beats are what bring him up. His production credits include Twista, Ludacris, Alicia Keys, Jay Z, Dwele, Slum Village, The Young Gunz and many many more.I wasn't feeling ""Through the wire"" when I first heard it, but then when I heard ""Slow Jams"" I was impressed. This young man will be the next top producer in the game. Right now it's the Neptunes and before that it was Timbaland. But Kanye will probably be the next one in line to win the award for producer of the year."
2,Overrated,"Talk about too much hype. The sample thing has been done before (did he go broke paying for all those beats??) so I wish people would stop acting like he's the 2nd Coming. Also, I'm mad that the radio stations are playing his entire album. No need to buy it, just grab a tape and record!Oh and that whole, ""I hate college stuff"" is really annoying and it only back up Bill Cosby's rant. Sure, Kanye is not responsible for kids educating themselves, but he could show a little responsibility. He may not have liked it, it is definitely not for all, but why does he add such a negative connotation to it? Young kids are so impressionable these days. ""College was not for me"" is a FAR cry from "" College sucks!""He's not that hot. And if I hear him featured on ONE more person's track, I will SCREAM!!!Yo ""Music Biz"" stop shoving these people down our throats!!! We're choking!!!"
2,a Producer no matter how you cut it,He has some interesting skits&Guests does Kanye West have on His album. He touches on different topics but what Hurts Him are some of the Material drags on&also the Cat ain't much of a MC.He has some Moments but more or less He is Better suited at Being Behind the control Booth.I dig His Bongo vibe through alot of His Productions.but I'm tired of the High speed Vocal Smapkes He does.that was cool back in 85 but now that is so Predictable IMO.this Album to Me is about a 2.5.
4,Yep...,"This CD is definitley one of the hottest albums I've heard in a while, and will probably be the hottest of 2004. Kanye's lyrics are just as impressive as his producing ability....although he's still no Pharrell Williams or Chad Hugo. He definitley gives Timbaland some competition. As for the songs go, I enjoyed every track on the album, including the Bernie Mac skits. I reccomend this album to everyone."
5,It's Tight!,"Yo, I just gotta tell everyone that this album is tight. Not to put the album down or anything, but it's not for everyone, I'm sure there will be some haters out there, but it's all good. It's something different, you know? He raps about some serious social issues as well as some of the usual hip hop rhymes about money, girls, etc. My favorite tracks are Get 'Em High, We Don't Dare, and All Falls Down. If you're into the soft stuff, Family Business and Last Call are tight too. Family Business is tight because I can relate to a lot of the stuff he raps about."
1,If I was as worthless as this guy....,"Id drop outta college too. He will never amount to crap . This isnt music. Soilowrk, Killswitch engage and Shadows Fall are what you should be listening to."
1,Poetry for Thugs and Thiefs,"OVER HYPED! Kanye West is being heavily promoted only because MTV is trying to push in a more 'serious' rapper with a pretentious name (I am sure his real name is either Tyrone or Jamal) like Kanye West. If you want rap, real rap, listen to Eminem, Vanilla Ice, Marky Mark, Beastie Boys, Kid Rock or Limp Bizkit. Those are real rap bands not LOSERS like Kanye West.Highlight: MTV uses this loser as a tool to show everyone that they care abou underground ""real"" rappers. BS."
1,THE WORST CD EVER,There was a lot of hype over this Kanye West album and I thought it would be good so I bought it. When I listened to it I was very disappointed. First of all this guy can't rap and he can barely even rhyme. I don't know what Jay-Z was thinking when he signed this idiot to rocafella. Kanye Wests style is terrible and he is a hypocrite. I also think he is very racist and his lyrics are offensive. This guy is a joke so don't waste your money on this stupid crap. If you want a great album I highly recommend Twistas new album Kamikazi and forget about that retard Kanye West.
5,Hip Hop Is Back!!!,"Kanye first and foremost is a genius. The album is packed with socially concious, funny, and overall good music, (similar to Mos Def) whether he's spitting witty wordplay (""Get Em High"") or plucking at your heartstrings, (""Family Business"") the roc's lead producer has made an extraordinary album sealing a future in rap music. If being universally critically praised and being deemed a classic album by rap magazine XXL hasn't already made you believe in ""the Louis Vuitton Don,"" take my word for it. The College Dropout was released well over a year ago, and fans all over the world including myself are still listening to it. The future of rap has arrived, and for all those that say hip hop is dead, how can it be when Kanye is still alive? Buy this album immediately, listen and love it, and then wait impatiently for what is sure to be another musical gem...Kanye West's follow up, ""Late Registration."""
3,coo,"I GIVE IT 3 STARS, I LIKED IT, IT WAS COO! NOT GANGSTA ENOUGH THOU!!BUT THE GROUP ALBUM SPICE 1 DID WITH MC EIHT ""THE PIONEERS""!! NOW THAT'S A CLASSIC ALL THE WAY THROUGH! I GIVE THAT ONE 5 STARS! WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!"
2,nothing special,"His sound is no different from the musical production of hip hop music 10 years ago from Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul. And just what kind of name is college dropout? Is that the kind of message to send to young listeners of his music? African Americans in the past have fought to be granted post-secondary edcuation, and we don't need an uncle Tom to discourage todays generation from getting educated. If you want to hear his better musical works, check out The Diary of Alicia Keys or Janet's Damita Jo"
1,NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,please don't buy this. this is straight bullsh*t. this guy is killing rap and hip hop. he cant rap sorry beats and soft. he is making rap soft PLEASE DONT BUY THIS...GO BUY A TUPAC CD
5,GET IT REALLL QUICKKKK,"get this cd..no questions asked its up there with the black albym..there is not one bad song and it has showstopping beats with ridiculous rhyming by of cours Kanye West..and others such as ludacris, jay-z, common, talib kweli, and twista."
4,A Refreshing and Creative Rap CD,"I listened to Kanye's album on the subway today. Fortunately, the lyrics were so engaging that I had to stop reading my book just to listen and pay serious attention to the them. This is a plus. Although when I got to around track 15 or 16, I got really annoyed by the anti-college bent of the CD. Also, around this point, there are many anti-college skits and rants. There are several skits on the CD and they are tiring.I am impressed by the caliber of the guest rappers on the different songs. It was nice hearing lyrics from Common, Talib, Mos Def, and Jay-Z, as opposed to some rapper pulling their friend from the block who just wants to be down.The beats were varying and enticing, and I never found myself just drifiting along through the album on several beats that sound the same. This was, in my opinion, one of the most creative rap albums to come out in the past few years. I'm glad I picked up this CD."
4,Great album..interupted by skits,"College Dropout is a great album; but too many skits ruin the flow of the album. Other than that, this is definitly worth the purchase."
1,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz..wake me when it's over,"How boring...and did the whole World get brainwashed for a minute?...Highly over rated..the sped up vocals have been done to death, Kanye's beats all sound the same, he is a poor MC...I often wonder if he wasnt associated with Jay-Z how many kids would check for him...there is nothing new or original on this album Kanye is NOT a saviour a Hip Hop and this album is weak and boring, as a rap listener since 1982 I have seen too much hype over substance this is a clear case of that."
4,4.5 stars - Nearly classic,"I have lots of respect for Kanye West. In high school, he got the superlative for ""Lest Likely To Succeed"", then he dropped out of college, then he started out as a small-time record producer for Roc-A-Fella, and just look at him now. That's real inspiration to me.I got ""The College Dropout"" when it first came out, and it hadn't left my car for a very long time (I still listen to it on occasion). The production is hot as hell, Kanye's got something to say on almost every single track, and there are real good guest appearances as well.Notice how I said he had something to say on *almost* every track. Yes, there are a few filler tracks on here, such as ""The New Workout Plan"" and others, which - in my opinion - prevent ""The College Dropout"" from being a classic rap album.Overall, most of the CD is good and worth the money. Add it to your collection if you haven't yet."
4,Great Debut Album,"After hearing to ""Through The Wire"", I had to go pick up the CD. Unlike P.Diddy, Kanye uses samples well. ""All Falls Down"", ""Through The Wire"", & ""Spaceship"", ""Slow Jamz""-just to name a few. He took Lauryn Hill's acoustic song and turned it into a great hit ""All Falls Down"". ""Jesus Walks"" is one of the best songs on the CD-because he came out with a secular song about Jesus and it was a hit on radio-not gospel radio, but secular stations. He had people chanting ""Jesus walks"" and that in itself is powerful.I like how his music is so real and socially aware. It is also an entertaining CD- ""New Workout Plan"" is a funny song that really doesn't fit this album.Overall, a good debut."
5,Kanye=Savior,"The entire album is hot. The beats, the lyrics everything is positive and worthwhile. I am picky with what I listen to. Gangstarr-Moment of Truth is my favorite album of all time, but this cd finally gives me somthing else to listen to. Best Album I have bought in a few years. I listened through the whole cd every time I put it on."
4,This is How it is,"Kanye delivers through this fine album. I am a huge Kweli fan, which drew me to Kanye seeing how he dropped the beat for Get By. Personally I expected the beats to be incredible and the lyrics to be shallow but clever at best. However, it is really the other way around. The beats range from mediocre to excellent and the lyrics are surprisingly consistent, catchy and clever. I bought the CD for like 10 bucks and for that, it is no doubt worth it. If you like underground appeal with commercial quality, check this out."
4,The best thing to happen to commercial hip hop.,"Its not about shoes, its not about getting shot nine times, and its not about his chromed out steering wheel. His flow is pretty good and his content is damn good. Beat wise ""through the wire"" is the best. ""Two words"" and ""All falls down"" are also amazing. If I hadn't heard ""Through the Wire"" I probably would have given this five stars. I guess I was expecting another beat like ""get by"". What I love about this album is the cohesion. Its amazing what having a single producer can do for the flow of an album. I also love that mos def, kweli, common, freeway, and jay z appear on the same album. A REFRESHING PIECE OF AUTHENTIC HIP HOP, GO BUY IT."
2,Thats it,With all the hype around saying this is one of the best rap albums i was going to buy this cd. But when i got it i played it then quickly sold it to a friend for 2 dollars. THat is how bad it was.The only good songs where the ones he released......
1,not good,he's not mase and he's definitely not kweli this guy comes off as a wanna be intellectual he needs to stick to the beat making and chill on the rnb vocal samples it's getting a little played out
1,Lyrics are a cheap shot!,"The rap and back tracks for this CD are pretty average so it seems that the only way that Kanye could get market share was by taking cheap shots with the lyrics. At the same time we see these explicit lyrics artists rip at the system, the music really offers no hope. This CD is filled with self-righteous anger and is not very listenable. It is a cheap trick knocking segments of humanity to make millions and then ride home to your mansion in a LIMO! Disappointed that this artist has chosen the low road. Maybe Kanye should have stayed in college."
5,"Kanye is the future, thankfully.","Don't get me wrong, I enjoy Nelly just as much as the next guy, but the entire pimped-out hustla, gangsta/wanksta club anthem rap has been entirely over done. The entire rap genre seemed to be destined to being nothing more than 50 Cent, that is until Kanye dropped this album. The production values are amazing, every track could easily become a single. From ""We Don't Care"" to ""Last Call,"" Kanye takes his listeners on an awfully personal tour through his mind and soul. The only complant I might have is that there were a few too many skits. But other than that, it is a flawless album. Without a doubt, ""College Dropout"" is the finest freshman album ever, any genre or artist. With Jay-Z's retirement now offical, Kanye has stepped up to the plate and made it so the ROC will be a force in music for many more years. I can't wait for his second album."
3,Kanye has a lot of potential as a rapper,"I liked this album a lot, as a producer I love hearing kanye's work and his sampling is always tight. I thought his choice of beats that he kept for himself was interesting compared to things he's done with other artists, I didnt think he kept some of his best beats, but they were all good and they fit his style and personality. As a rapper I think he gets outshined several times by his guest artists most notably, consequence, jay-z, and twista. But I also liked that he rapped about other things and not just guns and coke cause that stuff is getting really tired. He has a good flow, sometimes his lyrics get a little basic and silly but he keeps it fun and tight and thats most important, 3 stars for quality... 5 stars for potential and production."
2,Great Album But Really Bad Pressings on these Vinyls,I've always enjoyed this album as a CD but was very disappointed when I received the Vinyl album and I couldn't even listen to it because it would change speeds and voice tones and would skip around.. Nothing against the music they just need to make a new Master Record or something to correct the problems.. Good Luck with yours Buyers
4,Pretty Tight,"I just bought this album a few hours ago at the local Target and went home and slammed it into the player.. sounds pretty tight.. no regrets buying the album.. i cant give you info on the songs cause i havent listened closely to them, but from what i can recall, all his tracks sound tight.. i recommend it.."
5,Kanye the GENIUS,"There are very few producers who make a mark as a rapper in the game but Kanye is an exception the man is pure genius. Songs like ""Jesus Walks"" and ""Through the Wire"" leave you feeling like there's no-one better. This album will definately go down in history as one of the best EVER!!"
5,Perfection,I absolutely love this cd. There is not one song on this cd that I don't like. Absolutely perfect cd.
3,Maybe this album has to grow on me,"I would consider mydself a big Roc-A-Fella fan. But this album here is just not cutting it with me. Kanye West has the potential to be a big artist, personally I think he may have tried to hard on making his debut big. Because to be honest I was not all that impressed. Maybe I need to listen to it a couple more times before it settles...."
3,ok,"this album is nothing more than okit's definitely better than most top 40 hip hop, but that's not saying a whole lot& while kanye definitely builds a better backdrop than most rap artists, his actual rapping is a bit weakif you want ""smart"" rap, talib kweli is much better"
2,Am i the only one,Am i the only person who thinks this album is weak he has the weakest flow and is lame when riding the beat. He is like a cheap Talib Kweli with an even worse flow. The album has well too many interludes and they are all pointless. Its annoying because he is about to blow and his rapping abilities dont credit him blowin. The lyrics are good but are nothing that other rappers like dead prez etc have done for years now
2,The album and artist that singlehandedly sucked all hip hop credibility into a black hole,"I'm ashamed to admit that I actually bought this when it came out because at that time everything was all ""Kanye West"" this and ""Kanye West"" that. Well, at least I'll never fall for that again. ""Through The Wire"" is one of the most puke-worthy songs I've ever heard. For KW to even think that it was a good idea to speed up the chorus of ""Through The Fire"" by the great Chaka Khan so that it sounds like the chipmunks, and let it repeat throughout the entire song, the record label should have dropped him for that alone. Pretty much every other song is as equally pathetic. ""All Falls Down"" is remotely listenable, but only because of the strong vocal contributions of Syleena Johnson. If she weren't present here, that song would suck as much as all the others. This truly was the beginning of the end for hip-hop having any credibility whatsoever."
5,This is an awesome cd!,"Dont listen to everyone else this cd is aweosome, my favorite is slow jamz which is a wicked good song. every song on this cd is good. BUY IT! its worth every penny."
4,You need this album like Kathy Lee needed Regis,"All you so-called, would-be, hip-hop know-it-alls who criticize this album for not being true can kiss this. While ""The College Drop-out"" will not resurrect hip-hop (is that really necessary anyway?), it is unquestionably one of the better efforts of the genre. Kanye's lyrics are remarkably insightful - ""we wasn't supposed to make it past 25, joke's on you we still alive"" - and thought-provoking. Y'all need to WAKE UP (as Missy and Jay would say)...and that joint with Talib and Common - ""Get 'Em High"" - is kah-ray-zee. Anybody with any sense of legit music will appreciate and value this album."
2,Nothing but a dropout,"Over all, the entire album was a great disappointment for me.He destroys the tightest beats with his weak raps."
1,Wack,There are thousands of rappers that would lyrically DESTROY Kayne on the mic:NasRakimEminemRZAGZARas KassJeruGhostfaceRaekwonScarfaceCanibusRedmanJay ZMobb DeepJinU-GodMasta KillaXzibitetc etc etcEverybody riding Kayne and his elementary school raps has been deceived by the media and wouldn't know true hip hop if it hit them in the face. Kayne is garbage and will fade into oblivion in a few years!
1,"all hype ,a shame to chicago","i dont know where to start.this album was pretty hard to even get through the whole thing without a few ""this is whack"".kanye is commercial like a mothereffer.any true fan of good music whether its rap, hip-hop rock whattever, will tell you that this is garbage.probably comparable to mc hammer's whackness,but in modern time.if you want dope ishnit buy ol skool boogie down productions,2mex,the grouch,fathead,old mos def""new danger""was a dissaster,public enemy,wu-tang,old common""before whack kanye produced him"",go underground stay away from mainsream it usually dies within months.real hip-hop will live!!!!!"
1,BLAND RAP!!!,"This album is so awful, and the bad news is that I really regret buying it... But the good news is that now it's in my garbage bin.Where do I start? the lyricism is below average. Some beats are ok, and the rest are below average. Anyway, there's no point discussing about the contents of my garbage bin anymore, so here's whats on my top shelf: (May be you should give it a try)Mobb Deep - The InfamousWu-tang - Enter the 36 chambersGZA - Liquid Swords2Pac - Greatest Hits2Pac - R U Still DownODB - Return to the 36 chambersTalib Kweli - EardrumRaekwon - Only Built for Cuban LinxNas - Illmatic"
1,This isn't real hip hop!,"Kayne is dripping with wack juice! Act like you know! Kayne gets hyped up by the media and now heads act like he's a lyrical king. But you can't fool the Gods! The fact is that Kayne's raps are completely weak, devoid of any true wisdom inherent in the 5 Percent Nation. This lack of wisdom keeps Kayne from having the ability to look out of his third eye. In fact, Kayne is promoting slander in the airtime! You want real hip hop, go cop a Nas, Rakim or Wu album."
5,Just amazing.,"Man. Do I love this album. I just got it yesterday, and I am speechless about the College Dropout. I loved it so much I signed up on Amazon to tell you guys how great it is. You won't find any ""hardcore"" rapping in this album. All the kanye West haters out there, pick up this album, or listen to a few of the tracks in it. Guarantee you, that you will love it.Everything in this album is a masterpiece. Just like what I said, pick up the College Dropout today if you don't have it, cause you're missing out on one of the best albums of all time."
2,Album dropoff,"2 1/2The relatively fresh producer debuted with a strongly sampled single in Wire, but is very inconsistent and overly assured in his weakly-rhymed album, balancing out a majority of club blabberings with a few real standouts... becoming singles, of course."
2,I am giving it 2 stars thats right,"Ok Over rating hip hop these days is the norm,I mean kanye has some nice beats ,but damn the all got some whing in the back or some stupid catch,His lyrics P-diddy type no impressive, I only gave him 2 due to a 2 or 3 catchy tracks that its people.Quit jumping on the BANDWAGON JUST BECAUSE UR FRIEND IS LISTENIN TO IT.. Not a haters just a hip hop critic so holla back"
5,This CD is hot...,"I havent really bought any cds for awhile, but this cd is definately worth it. the beats on this cd are hot and so are his rhymes. its nice to hear someone rappin about other things other then guns, hos, and ice. all the tracks on this album are solid and i can listen to it all the way through. my favorite tracks on this cd are all falls down, never let me down, family business and through the wire. go buy this cd now, its definately worth it."
5,College Dropout,"This is a great CD. Based on Kanye's other work (Lucifer-Jay Z, and Slow Jamz-Twista). You can tell this guys got talent, and he proves it with this CD."
5,"Wow, wow, wow","I was a little skeptical getting the CD even when I heard ""All Falls Down"", and loved it... but I'm glad I did. Kanye has an inane ability to rap on various issues, and it shows just how versatile he is. It's extremely refreshing to hear someone rap about other things than women, money, and cars."
3,"I'd give it a ""5"" were it not for the message...","Kanye West is a brilliantly talented producer and, as we now see, performer. However, I get a terrible feeling about the message that his CD sends out. It appears to disparage the merits of higher education, and the pro-drug references are a little much. While this CD obviously contains the parental advisory sticker, I'm afraid that some impressionable youth will get his hands on it and take to heart what Mr. West says. Perhaps a more pro-education, anti-substance abuse message might be more appropriate given the ills facing our society today."
1,oopdang wannabe,O man dis album is totally wack dis is is so not good dis guy sukz bad donkey nutz o man dis guy is a retard he is so funny sounding o man dis guy really stinks my dog kan sing betta den dis dude he is such a peee-nut wata wenka.
1,hypocrit,umm how can a so called child of god put out a explict album and play it off as if hes some big christian with that song jesus walks im sure if jesus was here to see this he would be dissapointed because it seems all that mr west is trin to do is use jesus as a marketing toolto the music its not good at all id advise you to listen to something else anything id rather listen to apples in sterio
1,This Record is Trash!,"I looked at the other reviews and thought this album might be something, I was dead wrong. I like his beats but the rap needs lots of work. The songs on this album are all trash with the exception of ""Slow Jams"" which you could probably download. I would recomend that you buy Twista's Kamikaze instead. There's way more GOOD songs on that album."
1,I absolutely agree with the Matt reviewer,"Mariah Carey, Usher, and Kanye especially have no musical talent yet they're popular. Where is the sense in that. The only reasonably popular bands today are Fallout Boy, Black-Eyed Peas, and especially Green Day. Rap-crap regrettably dominates the hit stations these days. Some of those songs aren't even worth calling music. Today's hits are absolute garbage with so very few exceptions. Don't buy this! Don't support this awful music!"
3,"NERD's 2nd Album ""Fly or Die""","N*E*R*D consisting of Pharrell,Chad, and Shay will be dropping their 2nd album ""Fly or Die"" on March 23rd 2004. Go to www.n-e-r-d.com to listen to their future hit ""She Wants to Move""."
1,Kanye Worst,This is one of the worst cds in my collection. I actually used this cd for a coaster before.
1,Overrated garbage...,"Kanye West is one of the worst rappers out there, he's just as bad or worse than P. Diddy. You're better off listening to the following instead:50 CentLloyd BanksYoung BuckLudacrisTwistaChingyLil' FlipG-UnitSnoop DoggAnd anyone that thinks any of the rappers I just mentioned suck are probably just jealous, because these rappers are so good that they can't believe it."
5,Excellent!,"Though I don't listen to near as much rap music as I do other genres, I find this release to be very focused, different, and very refreshing! ""The College Dropout"" is very different from other rap albums and for me ranks up there with the likes of OutKast's double album ""Speakerboxxx/The Love Below"". Kanye's style of rap is different, and something about it makes it unique. As well as that, the production of this album is flawless! This album resembles (for me at least) albums of the past that showcased ""hits"" as opposed to 2 or 3 solid songs. Here's my rundown of the hits on this album: ""We Don't Care"", ""All Falls Down"" (it is ashamed Syleena Johnson is as underrated as she is), ""Spaceship"", ""Jesus Walks"", ""School Spirit"", ""The New Workout Plan"", and this is just to name a few. Furthermore, the interludes are not dumb and work well with this album. Kanye, I hope your next album is just as good, if not better (hopefully even better) than this masterpiece! 5 stars!"
5,Awesome,"I bought this cd thinking i would only like two songs (All falls down and slow jamz), but when i first listened to some of the other songs, they blew me away. He has awesome rhymes and creativity you wont find in 50 or eminem (not that i have anything against them). It isnt about violence and drugs, but has lyrics that have some thought in them. The way they did slow jamz is way better than the way they did it on the radio. I know if you buy this cd, you will find yourself listening to more than one song over and over again. For those parents who cant have all the dirty language, the cd edits it out perfectly and everything i have listened to so far has been clean. P.S.- Rock on, Kanye."
5,Rap is back?!?!!?,"Kanye West is the newest and maybe most talented addition to Rocafella records. He has been making beats for everyone lately, from Alicia Keys, Ludacris, and even Britney Spears. The man is the new Neptunes, except where their beats were weird, his are beautiful. He makes smooth beats that you can sit back and just bop to. Its not music that makes u have spasms, its pretty. It has soul and it has feeling, which i think is helped by the beautifully strewn samples from Mo-town hits and such. His flow is pretty different. He actually raps about things that matter. Doesnt talk about shooting people or how many stores he held up. He keeps it real to where he is at. It reminds me of old school lyrics with new school beats, its a perfect union. Get this album!! Even if you have been disappointed with rap lately as i have been. This man brings rap back to where it should be."
2,College Dropout...ok...I guess,"I thought this was an OK album but far from a classic. It only has a few good songs (We don't care,I'll fly away,Slow jams,Last call,jesus walks) but thats about it. The rest are just fillers. And why is everyone saying he is talking about new stuff and hes fresh. The Roots and common and many other artist like this have been making music like this for years. All Kanye is doing is talking about this stuff on sampled beats to make hits. In almost every beat he makes there is a sample. No doubt he is a good beat maker but without sampling can he make a hit. I like the album but I dont think it as great as people on MTV and TRL say it is. His rapping skill is average at best. So overall an average 2 star album."
3,Mediocre,"This was a highly anticipated album, but when I listenend to it for the first time, I wasn't impressed. The best songs on the album is ""Through The Wire"", All Falls Down"", and ""Jesus Walks"". There are other cuts on the album that are fairly good too, but not as good as the 3 I just mentioned.I will say that I do like Kanye's style which is very original. His style as a producer is very original and impressive, I will say.Listening to his album it seems immature or maybe its just on the light-hearted side. It doesn't sound like it's for over 18 and up, just about 18 to maybe 25."
2,Not impressed at all,I just listened to this cd a few times and while Kanye is one of the best producers out there right now his lyrics and beats on this album are very forgetable. 3 maybe 4 tracks are really good. Too many stupid skits. I look forward to hearing his next album! Maybe he'll come with his better stuff...
3,"Great beats, superior writing, questionable delivery","Let me begin by saying that this CD is hot. It was much better than I expected it to be. Kanye West is a phenomenal producer and his rhyme writing skills are evident. However, he lacks the one element that he needs to go to the next level - and that is presentation. Kanye can write and produce - but his flow isn't quite there. Take away the tight beats and I suddenly don't want this CD. Kanye sounds like a guy who produces and writes - that's trying to rap. He doesn't sound like a rapper. Listen to how Jay delivers - or how Eminem delivers before you crown this cat the Messiah. I think we have been so starved for good hip-hop that we are taking to this CD like a starving man would take to a Ritz cracker. Doesn't mean the Ritz cracker is good - but it also doesn't mean it's the greatest thing you've ever eaten. Kanye has the potential to be right there - he just needs to work on his delivery and presentation. Just my humble opinion."
5,Oh my Lawd!,"This musical masterpiece captured the essence of what Hip-hop WAS all about. Mos Def was right, this man is THE FUTURE. College Dropout is a headbanger throughout. Clever lyricism, superb delivery, and cold production makes this piece an instant classic! Fast forward 15 years...I'll be playing this for my kids so they can experience what real music feels like. Thanks Kanye for saving the Game. Folks don't get it twisted, you don't have to be bashful to do things the Chi way! Peace"
4,i hate naming my reviews,"This is a pretty good cd. Kanye West does an amazing job of producing the cd. Surprisingly, he's a good rapper. He doesn't rap about what most of the other rappers you hear about do. He talks about parts of his life and reasons for dropping out of high school. My favorite song on the cd is JESUS WALKS. Its an amazing song that is the highlight of teh album. I would give this album 5 stars but I didn't becasue the skits annoy the hell out of me. Theres like 5 and most of them are pointless. I think he's the only rapper on the Roc that can actually make music as good as Jay-Z. If it werent for the skits, this album would be a classic."
5,One of 2004's Best Albums!!!!!!!,"This is without a doubt, one of the best cd's I've heard all year!! Like a few of the 600 reviewers mentioned earlier, THIS IS REAL HIP-HOP!!! This is real music and deserves the credit that it has gotten. What really makes me glad is that MTV is playing his videos in regular rotation. Yes, his lyrics need a little work (he said that himself), but the beats are spectacular and really help to carry the album. Matter of fact, I could see this as being a classic in about 10 years.Overall, one of the best albums of the year and should definitely be nominated at next year's Grammy's.(P.S.: Congratulations to Kanye West for recently going 2X Platinum with this album!!)"
4,FUTURE CLASSIC,"It is about time a rap/hip-hop album has been able to be this good. Nowadays, there are so many rappers who put out garbage to everybody's ears, but Kanye West changed that. Mostly every song works on this album because they show his true talent. The highlights on this album are ""Jesus Walks"" ""The New Workout Plan"" and ""Breathe In Breathe Out"" with Ludacris. AWESOME CD!"
1,It's garbage,"Kanye is the typical example of what happens when the media and MTV and radio brainwashes the American public and the consumers into believing that someone or something is the ""next big thing"" in rap music. In another few years, he (along with his pathetic attempts at rapping) will be forgotten."
1,Bad Pressing on Vinyl,"This is not a review on the album itself, just the quality of the vinyl record. I have ordered this record twice and each time side A skips terribly at the same exact spots. My only guess is that it is a bad pressing. Even my older, more scratched records do not skip. The album itself is one of my favorites, but avoid buying it on vinyl unless you want it for decoration."
2,"not for music, but quality of record","I'm really disappointed. I love Kanye West, and I wanted to have his first album on vinyl.My dad ordered the album for me for Christmas, and side A of record one was skipping. He exchanged it for me, but now side B of record one is skipping. I have ordered records from amazon before, and this has not been an issue. So, if you order this in vinyl there is a possibility you will get damaged goods."
5,Classic CD,"This CD is a classic. I respect Kanye West as a rapper.I can listen to this CD from start to finish. This CD displays the raw version of Kanye West as a rapper. Overall, I enjoy this CD. This CD talks about how it is like going to college."
4,"First producing, now rapping!","I don't know why moderators or webmasters don't delete the Kids Review that was posted 70 thousand times, as it is unfairly lowers the score of the well thought out reviews that people have been posting about Kanye's debut album as a rapper. He breathes life into the crap rap that plagues the mainstream today. After coming out with the beats for Jay-Z and the likes that made my head bob in appreciation, he steps to the mic with an interesting way of flowing, using a near death car accident as his inspiration for this album entitled College Dropout, which smugly features him dressed as a bear; sports mascot sitting at bleachers. I do agree with one review that said that the skits do interrupt the flow of the album."
4,REAL Hip-Hop,"Kanye's debut album is something that hip-hop has needed for awhile.The rapper/producer has some great knowledge and can rap about it with a lot of creativity and a great flow and well since its Kanye he has his killer beats to back him up.The only bad thing about this cd is the skits and i know everyone agrees with that.The odd skit is all right but Kanye has 2 many on this cd although they do at least fit in and has something to do with the next song on the album.""Never Let Me Down"" and ""Get Em High"" are great songs.Never Let Me Down has 2 great verses from Mr.Jay-Z and is an inspiring song.Get Em High has a killer beat with 3 great verses from Kanye,Mos Def and one of the G.O.A.T's Talib Kweli.This album was the album of the year in 2004 and Kanye's new cd ""Late Registration""could be another classic."
4,Good CD for hip-hop,"This CD is breath of fresh air for hip-hop. The thing I like about this cat is his originality. He might not be the tightest lyricist in the world, but he's definitely above average. Of course, we all know how nice he is behind the boards. I would've gave it five stars, but I hate skits (I liked the Bernie Mac skits though). Next time, just let the songs flow in sequence."
3,average,"he is an inadaquete lyricist, and his beats lost their shine after a few listens. I prefer lyrics that equally match their production counterparts. He tackles some cool topics, but he really has little depth or opinions.Good for a few listens, but after that it's quite throwaway.Recommended to download, but if you still like it after a few listen, you should buy it!"
4,Kanye finna change the game!,"I only gave this a 4 because i've only been able to listen to the CD once so far. Kanye is some deep talent comin from the ROC. He brings a whole new look to a very weak rap game. Some of these other rappers need to be watchin out. About the Album though, Kanye's got some real stuff to say and he says it beautifully and with lyrics that make you think! Big ups to Kanye and all the ROC Familia. REPPIN ///\\\ ROC-A-FELLA"
5,College Dropout a Success,"Kanye West spit it like fire Trough the Wire, taught us about a little bit of old school Slow Jamz, told us how it All Falls Down and told us how Jesus Walks. Lets face it, Kanye is a lyrical and beat genious. He's just what the rap game needs, and puts out more positive than negative messages on the CD. The best tracks on here are: The New Workout Plan which tells ladies how they should get in physical shape and feel confident, Jesus Walks and Never Let You Down sre kind of mixed together,and have a very positive meaning, Space Ship is a song that many people could probably relate to because it tells about Kanye's struggles working the graveshift and not getting paid nothing, School Spirit is short and sweet but straight, Through the Wire is a classic, and Last Call and Family Bizness have a lot of meaning to them. Bottom line, Get the CD ya'll!"
1,sucks,"kanye is a horrible rapper, all he can do is make beats and produce albums. but he needs to quit rappin!"
1,Kanye needs to finish his college degree,"His attempt at establishing himself as a hip-hop artist fails miserably much like the classes he must have taken in school. College is not for everyone, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. Don't hate. It's obvious he does not have anything worth while to say. If he did, he would not have recorded that juvenille ""Slow Jamz"" If you want to know what lyrics are, what music is, then get Cee-lo's Soulmachine instead of this crap. Kids, don't believe the hype. Get an education or else you will turn out sounding as ignorant as Mr. West."
2,pretty overated,"kanye west while a great beat maker even though all of his beats have samples from other songs they all pretty much come out good i think this album is way overated just for the simple fact that kanye is a pretty bad lyricist while not terrible some of the stuff he says just does not make sense i would tell u to get this album if u just like to hear good beats but the fact of the matter is, is that kanye is a rapper first on this album and a producer second so he should pay more attention to his rhymes and while i dont agree with everything that kayne says because sometimes he is just blatantly racist i do enjoy some of the tracks on this album i would have to say my favorite track is family business i would say download that and just dont by this album u will be disipointed by the lyrical aspect of the album unless u r just one of those people who goes along with what everyone else likes make up your own mind this is just my opionion {and thats all that matters}"
3,3 For the production.,"This had to have been the most overhyped cd of the year. Kanye West has a couple clever lines out of all his songs, and his production is good, not great like people overhype it to be. Kanye has an extremely WEAK flow, that destroys the entire album. Most people are just following the hype that has been created around Kanye, being on Roc-A-Fella alone is enough for people to hype him up. Real rap music fans, stay away from this, and stay away from 95% of mainstream garbage."
3,A little too poppy for me...,"Too many tracks for the girly girls on here. The positive songs are kind of refreshing, but have been done better by others in the past.However, I'll give 3 stars, because there are a couple of good songs on here and some of the many skits are pretty funny and even have some truth behind them.Stand out tracks include 4,6,9,18,19, and 20. (18,19, and 20 being the only truly great songs on the entire album.)Not sure why this album is currently averaging 4 and half stars though.Bottom line: Kanye should stick to producing and stay off the mic, since some of his beats are nice."
4,I don't know,I don't know how I feel about him sampling one of the greatest songs ever written (lyrically speaking). All Falls Down is a lyric from Mystery of Iniquity by Lauryn Hill which is one of the most convicting/life giving songs I have ever heard. that woman loves the LORD like CRAZINESS and her Unplugged record reflects it. Get it. Soak in what she is saying. You won't regret it. That album has brought me to tears time after time.
4,Forget the Grammy nods and to heck with the 'critics'...,"...I announced this as THE CD of the year the week it was released and co-workers and friends alike looked at me in abstract awe. Producer-cum-rapper West displays the most culturally alive and [even better] the finest beats of the year. He's substance over style, and while he's never boasted to be the greatest MC, he's second to almost none in deft storytelling - his stance on the educational system not totally arguable, religiosity juxtaposed with positivity/negativity, the faith in his lord [not mine], the war within the black community [and the lack of political interest as opposed to hot rims], humbling yet boastful. In the realm of passe hip hop thugs churning out immature bile masquerading as macho braggadocio, West offers some of the most ripened and developed lyrics in ages. But it's his truths that are the key to his proposed longevity and it's the truths that set everyone free. All with his God on his side. Ironic, huh? My grade: A"
3,nice debut,"kanye west very well may be the one artist that can merge the underground, conscious hip hop with the commercialized, glitzy facets of rap. the college dropout is his first attempt at doing so. personally, i like his content level, in that many people can relate to his rhymes (working at the gap, black people being profiled, etc.).however...the album to me either is a song or a skit...and kind of loses its energy during the middle, with questionable tracks such as ""the workout plan"" and ""breathe in, breathe out."" thankfully, ""we don't care"", ""spaceship"", ""never let me down"", ""get 'em high"", ""two words"", ""through the wire"", ""family business"", and ""last call"" are either solid or exceptional enough to hold the album up."
3,All falls down is a banging............,I love Track #4 all falls down that song is sick...Way to go Kanye and Syleena Johnson...I'm still getting used to the album but track #4 get 3 stars alone.
5,ALBUM OF 2004!(...),"(...) great lyrics, awesome beats, damn...just great man....Tracks like ""jesus walks"" ""through the wire"" ""we dont care"" ""two words"" oh my god......how can someone make such great music???...get it now(...)"
1,Unbelivable,I find it amazing that people think this CD isgood at all... This CD is one of the worst ever..Just because Kanye West reviewed his own CD 300 timescalling it 5 stars... don't believe the hype... it'sno wonder the price of this CD is dropping like a rockbecause it's terrible
2,It sucks,"This album sucks. kanye West should just stick to making beats, because he can't rap. Even though most rappers talk about money, girls and cars, there is no point of talking about something else if you can't rap. I recommend Twista, or Memphis bleek."
4,Album of the Year?,"I believe Kanye's College Dropout is a top contender for Album of the Year. He has done a great job telling his story via the media to sell records and there's an equally relevant connection between his lyrics and most likely his true-to-life experiences. With all that said, what's up with the somewhat racial ""white man"" dig on ""All Falls Down""... ""and the white man gets paid off of all of that..."" Come on Kanye, I thought hip-hop had gotten off that vibe?"
4,Different,"I been following this mans music since the beginning. Since more than 90% of you knew who he is.. & Im gonna be serious, this is not a 5 star album! THERE IS WAY too many skits! Its stupid! Now, Kanye is a CRAZY producer! Always nice with the beats, but this CD didnt show it. Some beats were boring & dull! His lyrics were good. Some was real serious & some was funny. But this is not a 5 star, my man could have done alot better! I still like this album, and say get it! Its good, but definitely an overrated album!"
4,Cop it now,"Rap has been in a little funk for a while on. Its got to the point where its almost unbearable to listen to what these guys have to say. Plus most of their albums are not even worth the bandwidth to listen to them before coping it. It is a pleasure to hear an album well done as kanye's. The beats are extremely hot and the songs are great. Although i did not like the fact that he continually made fun of people who went to college. It was masterfully done. my favorites are jesus walks, through the wire, family business & all falls down."
2,most overrated rapalbum in years,"It's not awful but not as good as people seem to think...All Falls down is incredibly annoying with Shyleenas vocals all over the track with no time to breath, & Work Outout is incredibly wack too with popcorn-production and corny lyrics...A couple of good songs though, that get up I get down -song, speceship , through the wire and maybe 5 more listenable tracks but other than that...Way to many skits, almost as many skits as songs on the album..."
1,Kanye needs to move on,"Yeah.......so an average joe like kanye west comes along and says, hey i have this original idea! i am going to preach to the world that college is not for everybody. not only that, but every song on the cd revolves around this idea. in fact, it seems as though mr. west is telling kids that going to school is a waste of time, and the only way to achieve status in society is to become a big time rapper. when college dropout first came out, i thought hey, this is a pretty good cd. but when in god's name did this man become a musical legend, a renegade of rappers? im sorry, but mabye kanye should've stayed in school to learn some modesty, because his ego is way too big as it is."
2,One good song,"Not a very good album. I'm sorry I spent the money, Gold Digger is the only good song. :("
2,This CD should be burned rather than bought,"And when i mean ""burned"", i mean that you should burn this CD from your friend rather than spending your hard earned $20 for this CD. The reason why i say that is because, yes, there are some good tracks on this disc and he does have messages in his flows that you can relate to; however, 90% of the songs on this CD are crap, and sound like they were recorded in the back of a dentist's office (while getting his mouth wired shut. lol). I won't totally diss Kanye West's style though, because if you're looking for music with messages and themes that you, yourself, can relate to than this is a good CD for that- but don't expect any hard beats or crazy punch lines in his music (instrumentally and vocally). If I were you, i'd just get the Twista CD Kamikazee if you wanna hear Kanye West do raps on good beats and rhymes!"
5,"New, Bright, and Refreshing","Kanye is a new rapper, but definately not new to the rap game as he has been producing for a while and he obviously knows what he is doing as shown in the album. The beats he uses are extremely catchy and the lyrics are are not about bling bling which is nice. Anybody who is into rap should get this album. Also ive met Kanye and he is so cool it made me want to buy a second album just because he was so chill."
2,"Good, but not Great","I've been hearing this man hyped over and over again so I decided to get this album. It's definitely got some catchy hooks and decent subject material, but overall Kanye is a terrible lyricist. His lyrics are very simple and his flow is mediocre. This album will sell millions not because Kanye is a supreme lyricist, but because it's catchy. I'm not saying that I don't dig it, it's just fluff with good beats, catchy hooks, and sub-par rhymes. This is album is what I like to call ""hip-pop."" If you're a real hip-hop fan who digs tight lyrics, then stick to guys like Nas, Blackalicious, Mos Def, Sage Franics, Planet Asia, etc."
5,EXCELLENT DEBUT,"This is the best debut CD by any recording artist in a long time. Kanye puts all of his skills to the test and passes with flying colors. It's rare that you come across a CD that truly moves you the way Kanye's does. Emotionally and spiritually it takes the listener to another level, a level that's been forgotten by most of his peers. The Gospel vibe gives it a unique flavor. This is Hip Hop at its best, the CD you've been waiting for. I encourage everyone to pick up a copy of ""College Dropout."" You won't be disappointed."
5,IT'S THAT GOOD!,"I've been waiting for this album tome out for months based on the reviews I had been reading and it did not dissapoint. Kanye has a great delivery, nice flow and more importantly great lyrics. As much as I love 50 cent and others it's nice to see someone rap with a heavy emphasis on life and society in general without the gunplay. Usually if rappers take that approach they are on small labels and underground. I mean how long has Talib been around before blowing up with ""Get By"" (a Kanye West prodcution BTW). So it's nice to see someone on a major label paying attention to other aspects of life other than the violence.Since it's Kanye you know the production is tight so I'm not even going to go into it. The lyrics and flow is what many people don't know about."
1,Too Much Channel Searching,"I had this phone for just over a year with no complaints. However, just after the warranty ran out, the channel searching began. Every conversation was broken up by the phones never ending quest for the clearest channel. This never happened until the one year warranty ended. ..."
5,Great Italian Pasta Recipes,I bought this book on a lark and now use it often with great results. The last time that I made dinner from it my guest was overwhelmed by the great aromas wafting from the kitchen. She loved the meal as well. The recipes are easy to understand and include unusual ideas that I have never seen before.
3,no pictures,"Looks like a nice book,I did not use yet but I noticed that it has no pictures, which makes it hard to know what to expect the dish to suppose to look like. I feel that would probably make my job trying to impress my wife a little harder."
2,Interesting but not useful,"Since there are very few constructs presented in the Monster Manual, a toolbox to customize them is welcome. Constructs - It Is Alive seems like it could be this toolbox, but it has some major problems. First of all, this product is for Dungeons and Dragons 3rd edition, not 3.5, so you'll have to convert your finished golem if you play 3.5. Furthermore, there are a number of mistakes that can be downright confusing. One feat's description states that it allows a golem to gain ""more specialized"" core feats, but doesn't say what those feats are, unlike earlier in the chapter where a list of basic core feats was provided. An updated 3.5 edition would be welcomed."
4,"Field recordings of group vocals, chants, clicks and claps.","The Nguni peoples from the Southeast coast of Africa encompass the Zulu, Swazi, Xhosa and other tribes: thus THE NGUNI SOUND embraces all these traditions under one cover, providing field recordings of group vocals, chants, clicks and claps."
2,too many errors,"i just finished teaching a 10 week intensive course on database administration using this book, and i found that there were far too many errors to make this an effective text. the typos were extremely frustrating for the students, and virtually every chapter had several important mistakes. these typos make the labs all but unusable, and the book is in dire need of an editor! it made my 10 week class difficult, to say the least."
2,Vic's Worst,"I would consider myself a huge Vic chesnutt fan, and I must say that this album is a huge disappointment. Drenched in Daniel Lanois-esque reverb, the texture and production is blaaaaaa. But, the blame may not lay solely on Vic's shoulders. I think the Keneipp's are responsible for some of this mess.The lyrics are muddled and embarrassing, the tunes are rambling (it pains me to write this, I love ALL of his previous albums).The album is not without its highlights--""Fissle"" is great, and ""Sunny Pasture"" and ""Haiku"" are classic Vic ...... but avoid this album. If you are looking to discover the wonders of Mr. Chesnutt, check out ""West of Rome"" or ""The Salesman and Bernadette."" There is absolutely great great Vic Chesnutt out there. This just doesn't happen to be it."
4,Soft fragrance,"This is the fragrance my cousin wears and she always smells so good. I have a very difficult time finding perfumes that I like on me. I bought some because of her. It has a soft, clean smell - not overpowering. Very nice."
2,Don't like the fragnance,"The fragrance is ""too heavy"" for me. Did not return the item because I had already opened it. Only good thing is I bought the small sized bottle."
5,Short and sweet like its subject's prose........,"This book was written in 1961 just after Hemingway's death. Because of this fact, I think it gives a more accurate and intimate portrait of the man, his life, and his work. I've read alot of biographies on Hemingway and few offered a better all-around picture. It's also a short and breezy read that informs the reader as much as it entertains. Because it was written by an author who knew Hemingway personally, it follows the advice of the master himself: ""Write what you know about."" Author Kurt Singer shows here that he knew quite a bit!"
1,"Horrible, horrible!!!","I purchased this item from Eve's Addiction and it was a piece of crap!!! That's being kind...The stones were about to fall out, the setting was very, very uneven and what really bothered me more than anything else is that included in the package there's the signature of the person who claimed to have verified the quality or integrity of the product before packaging...I don't know what word would qualify to describe such a person because this was just an insult to me as a customer.I would never ever purchase anything from them or their affiliates again. They do not even include a return sticker as most of their competitors. Please do not waste your hard earned money!!!"
1,skip this book if returning to college,"If I could give this book zero stars, I would have. There is nothing in this book for non traditional students."
2,Not Much of a Challenge,"I bought this DVD because I have a yoga DVD (All Day Yoga for Beginners) with Suzanne Deason that I like. I'm haven't done much pilates and I'm definitely not an athelete but this workout (except for a few moves) was way too easy. Since it's a DVD for weight loss I was expecting to sweat or feel a burn in my muscles but I did this for an hour and afterwards I didn't feel like I had exercised at all. I've only done the workout twice because it just doesn't seem worth it. If you're looking for a good pilates routine that will challenge you, I'd recommend The Method pilates series."
4,Just What I'd Hoped For!,"When you order items like this online you have to hope that they resemble what you're shown in the photo. This item sold as a single, so I felt it wouldn't be a waste of money if it wasn't what I wanted. Well, it was better than what I'd hoped for! This banana split dish is larger than I thought and the quality is just fine. Each one is inexpensive enough for me to order more, which I plan to do as well as a few extra for gifts."

4,Any Fan Will Love~!!,"This is a great film for the Shippuden story.It introduces the 'Zero Tails' demon. I thought it was amazing to see something so different for once.And any Hinata fans out there, she's part of this mission, but only so little, but its great.During this time, the 'Zero Tails' is giving this dude who's claimed to be 'ALL GOD!""Then Sasuke appears and helps NarutoThey win as always.The graphics are great! :D"
5,Great Movie,I am addicted to Japanese Anime and have been since 1969. Naruto is my all time favorite series. I had a hunch that it was a read along but would have been great to have known it when I first looked at it at Amazon. A great movie and I enjoyed it a lot. I will purchase the English version when it becomes available.
2,BORING,"GOOD GRAPHICS, AUDIO. WHERE WAS THE ACTION, ONLY THREE ACTION PARTS ABOUT SO, ONLY ONE THAT FIGHTS IS NARUTO AND SASUKA FIGHTS SOME MAYBE A COUPLE OF PARTS. THE LEAF NINJA DOES NOT EVEN FIGHT. THE TRAILER SHOWED ABOUT ALL THE ACTION. I GOT BORED AND TIRED."
3,Not in English,I didn't watch the movie very much since I couldn't get over it being in Japanese language. From what I saw it was the usual plot for Naruto.
1,product discription wrong,The product description of this book is very wrong. The book's female main character is the widow of a man to seduced her and then through marriage took her inheritance. The book begins with the female main character trying to escape her worthless dead husband's parents who think she aborted their only son's child. The hero is going to return the dead husband's climbing gear and rescues the female character from the snow only to bring her back to the her evil ex-in-laws. He believes the in-laws about what a horrible person the widow is but is still attracted to her. Later the hero finds out the truth from a friend about how nasty the widow's husband was and tries to reconcile with her. The rest of the story is a back and forth between the two add in the hero's teenage daughter who he has put in boarding school so he can travel. Pregnancy does not come into it until the end.
1,BAD COMPANY - DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"I finally found a wii bundle for a decent price!!! Or so I thought... I ordered the product, only to receive an email several days later stating that my order had been cancelled. There was no explanation given. I'm a bit scared that it was a ploy to get my credit card info! Whether it was or not, I would DEFINITELY not recommend doing business with this organization."
1,DOESN'T WORTH BUYING!!!!,"This is way more expensive than retail price on market, Wii alone costs 250, an additional nunchuck costs around 20, all the other accessories like point card $19, Steering wheel $20, and sports pack $19 are just unnecessary items, plain waste of money, and all these should come up to a total of around 330 on retail price. They made it look like they are selling this bundle for cheap, but actually they are making nearly $ 120 off you on retail price. want a better deal? Go to ebay, you might get them for less than 300, and trust me all you need is Wii, plus an additional remote and nunchuck. Plus Ace Photo has really bad reputations, they ship very slow, last time they canceled my item for no reason on the last of the estimated delivery day without even inform me, I waited for 5 days for nothing, if I were you, I wouldn't purchase any product from them. One of the worst companies ever!!!"
1,"VERY VERY BAD COMPANY, DON'T WAIST YOUR TIME WITH THEM",I ALREADY BUY THIS PRODUCT AND A FEW DAYS LATER THEY CANCELLED MY ORDER. DON'T TRUST THEM. I BOUTHT THE PRODUCT CHEAPER SOME OTHER PLACE. IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE AT THIS PRICE
4,very good absorbs readily calms my skin,"I've tried many other SPF moisturizers for sensitive skin. This one is probably the best that I've tried.I have sensitive skin, and rosacea.This moisturizer has a very pale green tint, but it absorbs quickly with no trace of white or green residue.I would buy it again, and recommend it."
5,Nice,Ayn Rand is a very interesting person and when it comes to revealing government actions she is right on. I do not fully agree with her philosophy of life I do understand where she is coming from.
5,Atlas Shrugged today,"I purchased the Ayn Rand video because I loved Atlas Shrugged. The video really explains what is happening right now in America with the Democratic Party's attempt to change America to socialism/communism, which is simply turning the USA into a dictatorship with only a few people controlling all the money and giving it to their cronie pals. I am old enough to remember the USSR and their rise and fall. Don't let it happen to us.Purchased from Amazon.com."
4,Fits in a particularly tight spot,"None of the other under sink pull out baskets worked for me because there is only a very small space without pipes, but it's large enough to hold everything."
3,Track Listing,Track Listing1 The Universal (4:00)2 Ultranol (2:42)3 No Monsters In Me (3:39)4 Entertain Me (The Live It! Remix) (7:17)
2,no AC adapter provided and one that fits hard to find,"This product did not come with an AC/DC adapter and when I ordered a ""universal"" adapter with four plugs, not one of them fit. Buy a product that has the consumer in mind."
3,So SO,"This is a good heater, however it doesnt seem to keep the water warm enough. It only keeps the tank to about 70-75 degrees. I was under the assumption it would be warmer. I have about a 15 gallion tank."
4,Does what it says,"One of my turtles got sick because the water was too cold. So I purchased this heater to warm up the water a little bit. It did just that, even though the light is not always on, I know it is working because it has taken out the ""chill"" part of the water and allowed my turtle to get better and swim around he's pretty happy and active now.Also, I think the shell for the heater is pretty good, I think I will reuse it when I get a bigger tank and grab another heater with more watts to put in the shell.I recommend it for tanks under 20 gallons."
2,is not durable,When this product works it is great. However the first one I bought did not work even though I followed the directions exactly. Back to hte store I went and bought anohter one. The second one I bought worked well but only lasted three days. I will be looking or a third heater made by another compnay.
2,"I had one that failed, but my replacement is doing well","I had one of these for a year or so, but it stopped working and my poor turtle was freezing. I got another one as a replacement, as I could not find any alternatives, but the replacement seems to be working better than the first one did.The suction cups on the bottom are kind of annoying, as there always seems to be one that works and one that doesn't. But then the one that works might as well be glued to the tank when it comes time for cleaning. It is very difficult to move.Edit: of course, the day after I wrote this review, the thing stops working."
3,Just what I payed for!,"Use this heater for my 40gal breeder tank, works great for now. I like Tetra products but really expensive. So I rather by it of amazon. For now the heater works just fine !!"
1,Doesn't warm water,"This heater was not sufficient to warm 20 gallons of water in my turtle tank. I would often check the water and it would be cold to the touch. Also, you aren't able to adjust the temperature which is not ideal when you are nursing a sick turtle and need the water to be around 82 degrees versus 78 degress. I would recommend the Aqueon 06107 Pro Heaters Submersible Aquarium Heater, Various wattage. These heaters are protected so your turtle can't break them. They are nearly indestructible. I bought this at a local pet shop after the tetra heater didn't work and it works great!!! Don't but this!"
1,worthless,"this heater looks good but it does not work! I will be returning it. aI wentout and bout a fish tank heater--much better. don't get fooled by the label of ""turtle heater"""
4,Good Product,Very good product and remember in the summer you can unplug heater. For the price you can not go wrong and keep in mind the name tetra is well knowen.
4,Nice heater,Good for shallow water tanks (we have a turtle). Gives gentle heat and the suction cups work very well -- we use a rubbermaid tub.
4,Turtle,"Had a lot of problems with this heater they would not work and had 3 sent to me,, finally got one that still works today,,, it was hard because it get real cool here so I was scared it would break when I was sleeping,, my turtle would have froze so far so good"
5,Wonderful!,My turtle is much better with a consistent warmer temperature. She is eating better and I feel better knowing that her habitat is comfortable.
2,Not so warm,"I bought this item about 6 months ago. It did keep the water warm, but it never got to as warm as the box stated. The heater is now working randomly, and keeps the water at about 70-degrees, which is way below the required temperature. This item will kinda work for a very short time. As the saying goes, ""You get what you pay for."""
1,Horribly disappointed,"I bought this for my turtle tank, hoping it could help keep them warm. The heater wouldn't even stay together! It kept coming apart and when I tried to put it back together, it wouldn't go back! Huge waste of money."
1,Piece of junk.,"Piece of crap, worked for a day then went south. I bought it for my hatchling turtles and it never heated the water to what it claimed it did, I WILL NEVER buy another of their products, this was simply garbage, NICE BOX THOUGH, i think they spent more on the box than on making this crap, you are better off putting a candle near the water than trying this JUNK. Save your money and get something else."
1,FIRE HAZARD!!!!,"This is a very dangerous product never mind the fact that it is made in China and they are trying to kill us! After only five hours of it being plugged in, My kids came out of their room screaming""FIRE!"" The heater had burst into flame and the glass element inside the plastic had broken and there was ash all in the water. I just thank God that no one was hurt, we were home, and the turtle were alright. I bout this at Petco but posting on here to inform more than just the store employees. I have also wrote to the company and posted it on FB. Word needs to go out that this is NOT a safe product to buy!"
2,Heater that doesn't heat,"Purchased the 100 watt heater for my turtle tank. We used the heater successfully for 8 months and then it just quit. I contacted the manufacturer who instructed me to return the heater as it was within the 2 year replacement period. It has been 3 weeks since I returned the heater and as of today they state it has never been received. If they replace the heater, then great, but otherwise, it was too much to pay for an 8 month heater."
2,worked for a week,This worked wonders for a week then stopped working completely. Not worth the money and time to wait for the item for it not to work.
1,Unreliable,"I've tried two of these since that's all that was available from local pet stores (who sell it for $35 no less!). Didn't really heat my 5-10 gallons of water in my turtle tank. I bought a second after the first one burned out thinking that I just had a lemon. Twice burned (and perusing these reviews), I think the product is simply defective. Don't waste your money."
1,Doesn't work,I bought this and tried to warm my tank with it. I have a turtle. I saw that it wasn't heating the water at all. So I contacted the company and they sent me a new one. This one also didn't work.
5,our turtle loves this heater,"We have this in a tank with a baby yellow-bellied slider and a few fish. It is preset at 78 degrees, and keeps our water around 78 - 80 degrees all the time. The lowest I have seen it drop is to 76 degrees. Our turtle has really come alive since we inserted the heater, and he spends a lot of time in the water chasing fish and diving. He is so much happier now!"
3,It's ok.,"It makes the water lukewarm. Bootleg seems to like it a little too much. He shoves himself under it and raises it above the water so I'm afraid he's gonna get electrocuted or something. He's about 8 years old so he's a bit bigger than a large mango. Am I being irrational? Maybe. It works just as it should. The suction cups are weak. This heater is best suited for very small turtles that aren't strong enough to move it around. I haven't had it for very long and I think it broke already. What can I say, Bootleg is a beast."
5,turtle heater,"Tetra is a great name in products, and once again it didn't let me down. This little heater works great, and stays put."
1,Tetra Aquatic Reptile Heater,"I purchased this item on the 21st of October, 2011 and returned it on the 23rd. I have a 40 gallon breeder tank with four RED(red ear sliders) that range from 8 months to 1 month.The directions say to plug the heater in and wait 24 hours before putting your reptiles in and this is what I did but the heater DID NOT heat up the water. In fact, it turned off after 15 minutes.I figured this was a defective device so I shipped it back and went to Petsmart and bought the same one and this one turned off in 10 minutes!Frustrated, i returned that one and bought one at Petco, only to see that this one turned off in less than 15 minutes as well.I'm not sure if this is just my luck, but I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. It was a big waste of time for me and a huge headache!"
1,Works great for 3 weeks... then try getting a refund!!,"It worked for 3 weeks, then just stopped. I called the TetraFauna people to ask for a refund and the guy told me that I needed to buy a bigger heater- it is not strong enough for a 30 gallon tank unless your room temp is 72F. So this only heats the water from 72F room temp to 78F. 6 degrees is all shes got. After that it just dies, apparantly.I've read other reviews off of amazon and this has horrible reviews-- look elsewhere for a good tank heater."
5,NIce used for baby food,Used to make home made baby food--froze the blended food in the little trays-popped out EASy--then stored the frozen cubes in one large zip lock bag
1,Disappointed with design flaws and high maintenance,"After using a vintage aluminum ice cube tray I was thrilled with the size of the larger cubes. Ice-maker sized ice is puny and not very good. I went looking for the modern alternative to the aluminum tray. Bought quite a few of these Tovolo perfect cube trays. Disappointed is an understatement. First loading them is a pain. They are pliable and there is no good edge to hold when you carry or place them in the freezer. You kind of have to hold them from the bottom and slide them into the freezer. Second, my ""college-sized"" fridge/freezer"" took forever to freeze them (more than 12 hours). Then the ice was a pain to get out. You have to push them one at a time. I was going to give them as gifts. None of my friends will work that hard to get perfect ice. The cubes are cute and do the job though."
4,silicone ice cube trays,I have really enjoyed this product. It has been awesome. No more broken plastic ice cube trays.
4,TOVOLO PERFECT CUBE ICE MAKER TRAYS,"TRULY SHARDLESS ICE, BUT A BIT DIFFICULT TO REMOVE FROM THE TRAYS."
3,Great for the RV,"I only gave this 3 stars for 2 reasons. Because there is no space for the cold air to surround the water, it takes forever to freeze solid, especially in an RV. When it does freeze solid, it is extremely difficult to get the cubes out. I do like the ice they make but I do dread actually using them."
1,Leaves unpleasant taste and a waxy coating on your glass,I have now thrown these in the the trash - they give your drink an unpleasant plastic taste and leave a residue on the side of your glass.
4,lorilena,"These trays make perfectly square ice cubes and they seem to last longer than traditionaly cubes. Once you get the hang of it, it is fairly easy to pop out the cubes. Sometimes it's a pain, but it's much better than cracking your plastic tray to get them out."
2,Leaves residue!,"These silicone ice cub trays leave a waxy residue in your drinking glass! Makes you wonder how much of the ""coating"" sticks to your gut!"
2,Not Quick Release,"The cubes from these trays are nice and cube-shaped, but this does not make up for the trouble of removing them from the tray. The trays are squishy and each cube must be individually removed from it's space. This makes for some cold fingers by the time you are finished emptying the tray. Not bad in the summer, but positively numbing in the winter"
3,Records only in 4:3 aspect ratio,"The Philips DVDR3505/37 DVD Recorder records ONLY in a 4:3 aspect ratio [full screen]. It will NOT record in a 16:9 aspect ratio [wide screen]. Rather, it chops off part of the picture on each end. I had wrongly assumed that it would record whatever was received through the inputs without modifying the aspect ratio. This information was not made readily available or I would not have purchased the unit. I found the info buried in a note box on page 38 of the User Manual. Otherwise, it is a pretty good recorder and has good video quality. But, if you are going to watch the DVD recording on a wide screen TV don't buy this unit. The lack of 16:9 aspect ratio recording is a deal buster for me."
2,Does not hold preset info,"I was very glad to find what seemed to be a reasonably priced OTA digital tuner with a DVD recorder.When it works, it works fine. BUT. . .It does not always hold your timer recording info.The firmware (dated 6/22/07) at the Philips site was already on the unit I have. It took forever (felt I had won a video game) to finally access the info about my machine to see that the firmware ""fix"" was already in and there was no fix.I will live with it, but will check the recorder before each recording :(."
2,"good features, poor function","I tried two of these players, and they both had the same problem. It's very slow to act on navigation commands, like skip chapter, FFWD, etc. It got annoying having to wait for literally 5-10 seconds every time you wanted to go to a different spot on the disc. Other than that, the features are good. It records on both DVD-R/RW and DVD+R/RW, and the editing capabilities are nice. But I opted for a recorder that is also a good player, so I got the Samsung DVD-AR650. Both are at Wal-Mart, which means a good price, cheap extended service/replacement plan, and 3 months to return it. The Samsung only records on DVD-R/RW, so you have to finalize the disc before playing it on another player, but the menus and front panel display are much nicer than the Philips, and it plays discs without a hitch."
4,Philips DVDR3505/37 1080i Upscaling DVD Recorder with Built-In Tuner,"The product is excellent, my bad experience was with the seller. I received the product with the disc tray locked. I understand that the product was not new, nor send you something in bad condition. I play apart and fix it myself. Now it works perfect. Beware of the seller that I release for me. I hope it was bad luck and not bad intent. Either way if you buy something has this Seller Ask all the questions so that it is evidence and what does not happen to me,"
2,Be carefull - this model has known issues...,"Be careful before buying the model DVDR35057/37. It has several known issues including loosing all programming when powered off. For example - ours will loose programing when left turned off overnight and requires reprogramming each morning to use it. Phillips is aware of the issue and offers a firmware upgrade on their website which can sometimes temporarily fix the problem. We did the firmware upgrade but it went back to it's old ways of loosing programming after a couple of months. Next, we sent the unit in for repairs (under warranty) and described the problem to them. They listed solder/re-solder & firmware upgrade on the repair ticket - When we got it back it worked fine for one day then the next night it lost all programing again. I don't plan to send it back in because it takes them to long to repair it and send it back. I'd recommend looking at the next model up. Hopefully they've resolved this issue."
2,no thanks,"The remote is awkward (small buttons, bad arrangement).It lost the channel setup every time we used it, and it takes about 15 minutes to scan them all back in again.The letterbox window gets smaller at the top.We were sent the older model (type 1), even though type 2 has been out for a while.I returned it (Amazon will pick it up UPS) and switched to Panasonic DMR-EZ17S."
4,Philips DVDR3505/37,Item received as advertised. Works very well; the only downfall is that it is extremely slow during channel surfing. DVD records very well; very pleased.
2,Difficult to use,"Two problems:1. The buttons of remote are very small. The feeling of contact is poor. Not easy to control and select the function you want.2. The digital channels seem not complete.In my living area (Comcast), the Sci-Fi is 75-223; FOX News is 76-330.This DVDR only accepts two digits of sub channel number. Therefore, no chance to watch my favorite channels.Magnavox has a similar model in Wal-Mart. A DVD Recorder has digital tuner built-in. It also has 80GB HDD embedded. The price is around $180.Unfortunately, same issue. This unit only accepts two digit sub channel.Probably both of them are from same supplier."
3,It was good while it lasted.,"I bought mine from Sams Club on November 2, 2008 to record the election. Today is October 4, 2011 6:15 A.M. the dam thing has officially stop working. I am pissed. When Its works it's perfect. In the title section everything started freezing up. I would not perches another Philips maybe will try another brand but, It only worked for three years. I am pissed. I have met other ppl who bought theirs around the same time. And but at your own risk."
4,"Comercial style, stunning images","A large glossy book that outstands for its pictures. Written in a cronological manner, covers from the beginnings of the rap scene until nowadays. Very attractive to look at, but composed from a media point of view."
4,Fine overview of hip-hop culture,"Fine and well-informed history of hip-hop, the music and the culture arranged chronologically and by topic/theme. Comes with a CD (fairly inconsequential)."
4,problem sets would have been useful,"This is a text on the numerical analysis of a power circuit. Common methods used elsewhere, like Newton-Raphson, Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi, are applied to these circuits.It builds up elementary circuit theory. But now explicit consideration has to be given to the impedances of overhead lines or underground cables. Because the circuits being considered can span hundreds or thousands of kilometers. Whereas in a circuit on the table of a lab, wiring impedances can often be ignored.You need some background in power systems, but not necessarily in solving these numerically. The book could have been usefully enhanced with problem sets for each chapter, to let the reader test her understanding."
3,Interesting and inspiring!,"While this was a very well-written and inspiring book, I didn't like it as much as I enjoyed Two from Galilee. I felt that the author took too many liberties, deviating from the Bible and religious teachings about Jesus's life. (One example that bothered me that before He began his ministry, the author has Him fall in love and intend to marry a local woman. I felt disrespectful thinking about Jesus as a sexual/romantic being). As I read along, I had to constantly remind myself that this is a work of fiction and is not meant to be Biblically accurate, yet I didn't have these issues with the prequel to this book. Still, it was a worthwhile and reflective book to read, because it helps us to focus on the humanity of Jesus, and adds to the development of our personal relationship with Him."
4,Pretty useful,"I ordered this for my wife during her 22nd week after reading a lot of reviews that the 'Mini' would be sufficient for shorter people. It arrived in perfect condition. The mini snoogle was very good at relieving her back pain (which was just about starting), though it doesnt go all the way through the back. The multiple positions of use are pictured in the packaging card, but lacked any detailing. We had to guess which side was up/down since it was quite hidden in the pictures.For the price, would definitely recommend!"
2,Not comfortable and weird proportion!,"I bought this snoogle mini because I was having trouble sleeping mid pregnancy and felt I need support under my growing belly. I bought the mini since I'm only 5'2'' and didn't want the regular snoogle kicking my husband out of bed. Unfortunately, I returned it. It was uncomfortable to tuck between my legs and under my belly. It felt too short. I also felt it was too hard. I tried the variety of positions but it still didn't feel comfortable to me. I prefer hugging a regular pillow lengthwise along my belly for support, or a body pillow would also be great."
3,No replacement cover available,"I bought this pillow to help me sleep during my pregnancy (works fine for that, although I prefer my regular body pillow) & to use as a nursing pillow. I was extremely disappointed to find out that you can not buy an additional cover for this pillow. I wrote Leachco & they said the only cover available is the one that comes when you buy the actual pillow. My kids spit up A LOT & I need an extra cover to use when the original cover is in the wash. I am going to have to try to make this pillow work by putting waterproof pads between it & the baby. Kind of a pain when you pay so much for a little pillow...."
1,WOW this is small,"When this came I could not beleive how MINI it was, but I tried to make it work........I ended up sending it back! This product is way too small for a grown woman."
3,Not for me,"This pillow did not work for my pregnancy, it was too firm and hard to manipulate. It was easier to put a flat king size pillow between my legs and a small pillow against my back and lay on my left side. My baby does not like it either. I thought I could use it for her to practice sitting up, but she get uncomfortable pretty fast. Not sure what I will use it for."
3,Not quite what I had hoped...,"The Snoogle mini was a tempting choice, because it didn't seem like it would take up as much space on the bed--plus it was cheaper. Well, it turns out it's just too small to be much better than a regular pillow--I can't get it under my head and between my legs at the same time very comfortably. I'm not super tall--just 5'7"". I suppose it might work out for the very petite, and the pillow aspect of it is comfortable enough. It just hasn't worked out for me."
4,Great value!,I thought this was a good price and it did what I needed it to. It provided much needed support to my belly and helped relieve strain on my back. It worked well for me (5 feet tall) and kept me from rolling onto my back while I slept.
3,A little too mini...,"I used this pillow for a good portion of my pregnancy...it worked better than a body pillow but I think it is for shorter women. I couldn't have it between my legs and under my head at the same time. Also, if you change position during the night it is very difficult to do without a lot of re-positioning."
3,Mini Snoogle,"This pillow is soft and durable but its way to small for me (I am 5 ft 8). I can't get it between my knees and under my head, it has to be one or the other. I wish I had spent the extra $40 and gotten the regular snoogle. Now it looks like I wil be getting both. I think it might work instead of a boppy so I might leave that off my registry and try this."
4,Nice huggable pillow for side sleeper,"In hindsight, I probably would have been better off purchasing the full sized snoogle. I didn't buy it because of pregnancy issues, but because of back issues. It is good for propping oneself up (with another pillow underneath) to use like an armchair, whilst watching TV in bed... it is a nice height to use as a regular pillow. I don't like the texture of the pillowcase (for me it isn't soft enough) - so I put two regular silk pillow cases over the existing cover. As such, I haven't had to try and get the cover off, so I don't know how difficult that would be to get back on."
3,Not very comfy,I am 5'4 not very tall but yet this thing did not work for me. For some reason I kept feeling pressure on my things and I decided to use it more as a back rest. Maybe I should have gone for the more pricey ones.
1,Hated it,When I was pregnant I tried and tried to actually like this pillow. I could never find a single comfortable position with this thing. It was a huge waste of money! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS THING
2,can't support belly and back at the same time,"I had the original Snoogle and was looking for a replacement since it's gone a bit flat. I figured I'd try the mini out since the original did take up quite a bit of our CA king bed. I'm not that tall (5'5"") and not that heavy (125lb pre-prego), so I didn't think it would be an issue. Unfortunately, I wish that I had just ordered another original.The mini is too small. I wanted something to support my belly and back at the same time, however the mini is too short to support both. I still use it, b/c I can't return it (since I needed to open the package to actually try it out), but if I had the opportunity to do it over again, I just would have ordered the original."
2,Flop!,"I was excited about getting this when I was early in my pregnancy and wasn't sleeping comfortably. I will say I was let down by this pillow. It made it even harder to get comfortable. However, after having my baby it was handy when younger kids wanted to hold her, or breastfeeding."
3,Good pillow but a bit cumbersome,I got this body pillow to help me during my pregnancy. I'm in my last trimester and am having difficulty finding a comfortable position to sleep. The pillow does alleviate some of the stress and strain but it is a bit difficult to get it to the right position for one to have a good nights sleep. I kinda regret not researching more into body pillows
3,Talk about MINI,"Opt for the larger version, I am 5'2 and have a hard time getting comfortable...and I am only 13 weeks. I can only imagine how difficult it will be to use, as my belly grows. It does help to keep me sleeping on my side, as pregnant women are not advised to sleep on back during 2nd and 3rd trimesters."
2,Disappointing,"As much as I wanted to like this pillow, I didn't. The fabric isn't very breathable and it sits only between your thighs, which may be fine for some, but I am preferring my whole pillow length-wise to keep my entire leg in alignment. The curve in the pillow is too short would be greatly improved if it were longer. I'm 5'4 (and plus-sized) and it was simply too short. It sure is cute and I liked the fact I didn't have to use it as my neck and head pillow if I didn't want to, but I will stick with using four of my regular pillows for now."
2,Uncomfortable & Useless,I purchased this for my pregancy and found it a total waste of money because it was so uncomfortable. After my baby came I cut it down to make a spare boppy. Save your money
2,Worthless,"I bought this pillow thinking that it would work well with my height compared to the regular size snoogle. Wrong-O. I am 5'2"" and it was worthless and awkward. I honestly can't imagine that the regular size would be much better. A regular body pillow would work much better and be less of a hassle."
2,Don't buy this product,"My husband got me the Snoogle Mini because we have a queen size bed and the total body would have kicked him out of bed. I am 5'6' but I did expect it to fit from neck to bottom as, in my opinion, the shape suggests. It doesn't fit. I have turned into every position described on the package and it was just uncomfortable. I'll try to use it to nurse or I'll use it when the baby is old enough to sit but still needs a support. If it doesn't work for either of these activities I'll come back and take another star away.Totally disappointed."
2,Can't really figure it out,"I bought this when I was in my third month of pregnancy and just starting to show. I tried it for a couple of nights and couldn't really figure out how to get comfortable with this thing. I think if it had maybe a little bit less stuffing, I would have been able to get comfortable with it, but this just wasn't working for me. I tried it again every so often as my belly grew and I'm now at 30 weeks and still can't get comfortable with it. I'm 5'4"" and plus sized but this just isn't working for me. I'll stick to my body pillow from Target, thanks."
3,A little bigger than I was expecting,"For it being the ""mini"" I was expecting a smaller pillow. It's pretty large, a bit too large for me to be comfortable. I'm keeping it anyway because I'm too cheap to pay for the shipping back."
4,Good product!,"I was using 3 pillows to try and sleep comfortably with one between my legs, one under/next to my belly, and one under my head. With using the Mini Snoogle it takes up less space in our bed and I only use this and one pillow under my head now. Don't expect for this pillow to fit under your head and under your legs at the same time b/c it is the mini and is shorter. This product is great for shorter women. I am 5'1"". I don't suggest getting the mini if you only want one pillow to use under your head and between your legs. In that case, I would get the regular Snoogle! This pillow works great for me b/c I am fine using a regular pillow for my head."
3,Not really that comfortable,I read many good reviews about this product before purchasing it. I was originally going to get the Leacho Snoogle total body pillow until I saw this mini version of it. I was afraid (like many other reviewers said) that the total body pillow took up a lot of space on their bed. I tried this pillow for 2 nights in all the positions they recommended and so far none of them are comfortable enough for me to sleep in. I am now 23 weeks pregnant and are having back/pelvic/butt tuck pains and are really looking for something that can help me sleep at night. I am having a lot of trouble sleeping ..falling asleep and staying asleep. I would give this pillow a couple more try but so far I am not really satisfy with it.
4,Definitely adds comfort,"I am not a side sleeper, so making the switch due to pregnancy was tough. This pillow helps me stay on my side and gives shoulder and hip support. You have to experiment a little to make it work for you, since you can use it different ways. It is definitely not a full-body pillow - I'm very petite (5') and it only supports me from hips to shoulders, and that's with me curled up. As I get bigger (am 20 weeks now), I think it's still pretty supportive, but time will tell. I wanted this rather than the full-size so that it wouldn't fill up the whole bed, and I think I'm happy with that decision."
4,Perfect size pillow,"I had been having severe hip/leg pain with this pregnancy, so I was looking for something to help alleviate the morning pain. This pillow is the perfect size, doesn't take up the whole bed, so I can still find my husband!"
4,Strangely enjoyable 80's style horror,"Hide and Go Shriek was suprisingly good of its type. Like Friday the 13th and its zillions of imitators, this film centers on a group of teens interested in the usual booze and sex. Gratuitious nudity is no treat for female viewers, but if you can look past it you'll find an atmospheric entertaining film. The Furniture Store is chock full of eery looking mannequins and there is a terrifying elevator scene!! Its different and pretty good for horror fans."
3,Average travel video.,Has good context and informative. Needs to be a little more informative on driving from city to city and have a little more detail per city. You can tell its 5 years old also.
3,Touring Australia or Giving a Lesson?,"This video had good and bad points. One of the good points is that the video shows many images of Australia. The video also uses actual documentary footage and recreates events using documentary style, and incorperates the older footage into the modern footage. However, the video is a little slow, and the narrator has an English, not Australian, accent. The video has more of an educational then entertaining feel. I got the idea that this video may have been made for public television, and it definitly wasn't made for an American audience. If you're looking for a video to show to a class, this might be a video for you, but I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for a travel video."
3,sometimes 4 is too many,"The suction cups work great for a camera platform, but it is hard to mount all 4 cups on a car, since most cars have curving surfaces, I recommend the 2 cup model for camera use, with a safety line. The 2 cup model can even be hard on some windshields to mount. I find that the 4 cup model sits at home a lot."
3,Nanny Diaries,"The title pretty much says it all. Young woman can't find real job, takes nanny position for spoiled kid in upscale neurotic family."
3,A Harmless Way to Kill Two Hours,"The Nanny Diaries has a great cast from Scarlett Johansen, Laura Linney, Paul Giamati, Chris Evans, and Alicia Keyes and I thought the idea of having the movie wrapped around the idea of a journal for grad school, but despite the best efforts of this cast, everything seemed like it was just put out there, Annie's a college graduate trying to find herself, Mr. X is a creepy old man, Mrs. X is self absorbed and more concerned about shopping and social engagements amid the elites than her own son. Based on the cast alone, I wanted to rate this higher, but there's something missing like another reviewer said about expecting something more about the biting realities of the upper East Side. Still it is a perfectly harmless way to spend two hours and eight to ten dollars, these things no matter how good they look on paper sometimes are lacking in practice."
3,"Fits Perfectly in The ""Okay"" Category","This movie is definitely one of those rentable, watch-it-once, be amused, and never-see-again types.It's entertaining enough to keep you interested, but it's not terribly compelling. Laura Linney does a good job portraying the character of Mrs. X, but none of the other characters are all that well-developed. It's too bad, because Scarlett is a phenom actress and she really should have passed on this movie.You won't walk away from it thinking, ""gosh that was terrible"", but I doubt you'll be inspired either.As I said in the title of my review, it's just okay. Nothing more, nothing less. Save it for a boring rainy day."
3,I preferred the book on CD,"I really wanted to like this movie. It has great actresses and a wonderful premise, but I just did not like it. The characters in the movie are so overdone and pushed too far into the satirical message so quickly that they just come across as annoying. Also,the acting was not as strong as it could have been.The Basics: Annie is a recent college graduate who incidentally becomes a nanny for the X's, a wealthy New York family. Annie lies to her mother and searches hopelessly for her identity while taking care of her charge. The movie addresses the lack of parental involvement in households where nannies end up raising the children. In the end Nanny finds herself once she is forced to leave her job as the Nanny.I preferred the book on CD read by Julia Roberts."
2,"Sadly, a flat and inconsistent film with little dramatic tension","Every supporting character is one dimensional while Scarlett Johanssen, looking absolutely beautiful, is given predictable situations and dialogue against the stoic and clueless Laura Linney. The voice over setting this film up as an anthropological study does not remain throughout some of the most important incidences in the film. It becomes a non-entity set against flat, nondramatic moments. A disappointment all the way 'round about what could be a compelling subject."
3,I Like It!,I enjoyed this movie & the performance of Scarlett Johansson. It was fun to watch. I would recommend this film.
5,So good I watched it twice!,I was a nanny to a rich ungrateful family and this story brought back some memories! I thought Scarlett Johansen was a great lead.There were some real laugh out loud moments of the book. I laughed and I cried. I didn't think the movie would be as good as the book but I was wrong!
2,Comedy???,"This is one of those movies where they put all the funny parts in the trailer. The movie itself is not that good, and actually rather depressing. I could barely stand to finish it."
4,Good Movie. Scarlett Johannsson Is Motherly And Thus A Treasure.,"The Nanny Diaries is a terrific film starring Scarlett Johannsson and Laura Linney. Ms. Johannsson has grown up since doing ""Home Alone 3"" and she is simply motherly here. I just like the relationship between her and Grayer. their scenes together are simply the best part of the movie, and-SPOILER!!!-their final scene is heartbreaking. Had I written the screenplay for this movie, I would have deleted the religious profanity (ie. God's name followed by a mild curse word) and added several more scenes between Annie and Grayer, and the lack of closure between them is the reason for my giving it four stars. Ms. Johansson should do more movies like this and a sequel to this film should definitely be made. Rated PG-13, but should have been rated PG."
2,Scarlett made it bearable,"Being male I found this movie's portayal of the sexes disparaging to say the least. It has women as honest, hard working, kind, and constantly taken advantage of. Men, on the other hand, bad men! Men are adulterous, sexist, selfish pigs, and always taking advantage. Except for the College Hottie (who I'm sure all us average Joes can relate to). Don't mistake me...I'm not obssesed with hating this movie or anything. I'll probably write this review and forget about it. But I'm sorry I wasted two hours watching it."
1,Dreadful DVD quality,"There's something very wrong with the way this DVD scans -- all sorts of shakiness and lines when there's movement, especially panning. I'm watching the ""Blockbuster Exclusive"" DVD, so maybe it's just confined to this version. But one way or another, it's inferior and annoying to watch. Someone skimped on the quality."
2,Rather painful to watch,"The beginning scenes were more of a distraction than good cinematography. Then we got into the characters which were rather painful to watch and the sad part is that there is some reality that people act and do these things. There were funny parts, but in all I had trouble wanting to watch this movie after 40 minutes, it was just too painful. Wouldn't suggest watching or purchasing it."
4,Great acting and premise,"Other reviewers found this movie trite. Perhaps the difficulties wealthy white New Yorkers face isn't profound enough social commentary for some. I thought it was great. The acting, directing, and writing were well executed. Paul Giamatti was especially good. The best thing, though, is the window it gives into the upbringing of the upper classes. Here we have a child ignored by his parents, and loved by a succession of nannies who abandon him. Of course, you might come away with some sympathy for the devil. That's the point. Why are those who've been given everything for nothing often arrogant, distant, and unhappy? Watch the movie. It isn't a touching story about how someone without hope overcomes the odds. It might tell you why those folks seem so hopeless in the first place, though.I've given it four stars to be picky. It's a really interesting piece, but not my favorite movie ever made. I might watch it again, but probably with someone else."
2,ABOUT AS ENTERTAINING AS A MIGRAINE!,"Ouch! What can I say that's positive about this film?...well...it has a good cast and you get to see Scarlett Johansson in her underwear!, other than that this film is just painful! It's not nearly as funny as it thinks it is and I found myself wondering why this young woman was putting up with such abuse!I would call this a ""chick flick"", but that would be an insult to the genre! This is really not worth your time and I suggest sticking a pin in you eye if you want a similar result! 2 stars is a generous rating."
4,Fun DVD,A great video when you want just a little harmless entertainment....with a moral. It's a no-brainer....it's just fun.
3,Like watching a Cliffs Notes version,"Scarlett J. is wonderful to watch, as are Laura Linney and Paul Giamatti, in this story of a young nanny in Manhattan. I just wish things had been fleshed out more in terms of the story, background, and people involved. Also, it seems odd that the nanny wouldn't even go back and visit the little boy who was so distraught when she was forced to leave and she wasn't even allowed to say goodbye to him.Not bad, but one has a feeling that the book is far superior."
3,Not That Bad,It's not a bad movie to rent. I wouldn't own it. Definatly saw worst. Kind of reminded me of Bridget Jones.
3,The Nanny Diaries,I kept waiting for the movie to start or for Scarlett to say something to stick up for herself somehow. At the end it was a good movie but it needed something more in the middle.
2,...a mess that should come clean.,"I don't have a problem with the movie so much as I do with the two former nannies who compiled this content into a book. I mean, wow, big deal...rich people in NY pawn off tedious work related to parenting and other daily tasks to others. What a shocker! And the ending... well, it's all a little too nice and tidy.The main character struggles with getting close to the child she is responsible for, but somehow manages to get fired, just in time for her to write a story about her ""anthropologic adventure"" - which is submitted as an application to grad school. Yeah, she got close enough just to establish a bond and generate enough content for a story. Then it's ""see you later, rich=bad people - I'm off to publish a book!""lame."
1,An Awful Waste of Time,"A terrible exercise in tongue in cheek social commentary. Scarlett Johansson stammers through every single line in the movie. She is horribly miscast in this sad excuse for celluloid. Very disappointing. The book was far superior (I know that sounds like a cliche, but in this case, it really is true)."
5,A book for economists and engineers,"This is a marvelous book on the origins of modern economic thinking and the role of economic thinking in engineering. Apparently the French engineers who developed modern quantitative engineering also developed the origins of contemporary microeconomics economics, to help them understand some very practical problems. The book offers a nice history of the engineering roots of modern economic thought and economic thinking in the field of engineering. In addition to his economic contributions, Dupuit, the major character, made major contributions to hydraulics. The origins of much economic thought in engineering is is not too surprising as both disciplines share a similar objectives. Every engineer interested in economics should read this, as should every economist interested in interdisciplinary work and the origins of economic thinking. However, others are likely to find it boring."
3,Fun game,"This game is fun. I like that it has ""special cards"" you can use to spice up the game. The only thing I don't like is you cannot save any information for the next time you play (like your name, etc.) or the game itself. Most games like this are the same way. Otherwise, it's great"
5,so much more fun than i thought,"i play this game more than any of the games that i have and i love it, it's just so fun i like to play it on teams the only thing i dont like is that it wont save your profile so you have to keep typing in your name"
5,addictive,I got this game because I had bought it for myself for my Nintendo DS and my mom got so addicted to it that she kept it for 9 months! So I finally bought myself another one.
3,Wouldn't have read it if it weren't required,"This book was interesting and well written, weaving the themes of slavery and oppression with the characters of a Shakespeare play. Although I admire the author's perseverence with the theme, I found it tiring and often hard to get into. I read it for a class and can't say I would've given it a second glance otherwise."
3,There are better Donna Leon books,"Just finished reading this book on a trip to Venice. While the context of her stories is always interesting, the plot line in this book was weak. Several theories behind the crime were explored and abandoned with little connection between them and virtually no connection to the final outcome. Her other books (e.g. A Noble Radiance) are much better."
1,Doctored Evidence,Didn't like this book. It was too wordy in parts and there was too much Italian spoken for someone who didn't speak Italian.
3,"A Great Opening, And Then.....?","Few people in Venice trust the cops who tend to be dense, crooked, and conniving. One exception is the compassionate, clever, and honest Commissario Guido Brunetti, Donna Leon's series detective. Venice is a city that thrives on gossip, corruption and petty politics. Brunetti calls Italy a loony bin.A cranky, nasty old lady is found murdered in her apartment. Her maid is suspected because she takes flight and later while running from the police is killed under a rushing train. Case closed by his colleagues--but not by Brunetti who finds a witness to disprove the maid's guilt. The detective not only has to solve the case but fight off a superior and underlings looking for a quick solution.This is not Donna Leon writing at the top of her form. It's a listless story that is a fairly long slog plodding to an ending that's a let-down. The story's pace is one that only a turtle would love. But I still like the series and especially Guido"
2,Vol. 1-Greatest Hits,"I have to say that this CD is average. It has some decent songs, but not enough for me to recommend. Also, the interludes include too many basketball highlights. They are some good highlights, but I want a CD for the music, not the talking in between. Overall, it's not a bad CD, but there's not enough good songs to recommend."
3,"Rule, Brittania, up to a point","The author did a great deal of research and believes that none of it should be lost. So we learn who went where of an afternoon, by what route, with what kind of contraption and how many horses, and what they had for tea. This book needs tightening up. Also, I find it very one-sided British. While the author mentions the Stamp Act and the Tea Party, he never really mentions where the basic call for freedom came from and how it developed into the ultimate uprising."
2,This is boring,"What looked like a new book explaining sex in our time turned out to be a disappointing collection of ""facts"" and fables covering the last couple of millenia. No attempt has been made to correlate the facts or try to sort out those which have proven less than useful or even outright fictitious. As a result you could use this book to prove almost any point you want. It seems the author wanted the book to be all things for all people and she has ended up with a book that is nothing to nobody. Obvioiusly, I didn't enjoy the book and finally quit reading about half way through when I realized there was nothing new here."
5,They don't make Walkman-type radios like this any more !,The SRF-49 antique Walkman-style radio is harder and harder to find. The AM reception is incredible. FM is solid with no overloading in the DX position. The controls are large and logically placed- well suited for an older user. Get this radio while you can!
5,These shoes are wonderful!!,"I was leery about spending 30.00 on a pair of shoes for a baby but you know, they are just so well made and comfy not to mention adorable as heck. These are our new favorites. One thing though they are a little on the wide side and my daughter has petite feet but no worry, that's what the velcro straps are for. With them tightened she wears them fine and has plenty of room to grow which is a big plus.UPDATE: Sadly I had to return these shoes. I mentioned that they were loose on my daughters feet above and tried to tighten the straps. That worked until she started moving around and crawling then they fell off. They were fine in the length but I guess her feet are just too narrow. These are great shoes otherwise. I may try another style like the Katelyn or even Lola and see if they work."
4,Adorable,"This shoe was adorable on my little girl, I had a million comments on them, however, as she wore them, the leather straps began to stretch and the didn't stay tight on her feet. I loved them, but they could improve on the straps by making them out of a different material so they don't stretch out."
4,Cute shoes,These are very cute and flexible shoes and my daughter liked them very much. They did wear holes in the soles a little quickly though since my 1 year old was wearing them on cement (maybe not made for that?). Also these do run a little wide.
4,The Mystical Language of Icons,"An excellent book for those interested in iconography.Set at a level for both the experianced writer, who wants to refresh their knowledge and yet also for the novice who would like to investigate this area.The explanations of the icons are wonderful,while the prayers from the eastern orthodox church illustrate the deep comtemplative spirit of this media."
4,The Mystical Language of Icons,Excellent explanations of the symbolic meanings withen icons. I liked it.Marguerite CulhaneEagle River AK
5,The Mystical Language of Icons,Wonderful book. One those you can't put down. Great art. And i hope he does more on the subject. Just a great book. A+
2,Good read,"This was not what i was looking for but a good read indeed, the pictures are beautiful and a good indication, but i felt it needed more."
5,Beautiful Pictures,Purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. The pictures and information were beautiful and the information on each icon was very complete.
1,Falsely described/shown,"These mats are NOT PINK!! The ones I got are a light orange color & the darker area is like a burgundy color. However, there's no way to return them! It says they're pink, and there are no other color options to get! I tried to talk to someone about the situation but was ignored. So now I'm stuck with $30 floormats that are the equivelant of garbage to me."
5,A Survey of English Christian Revivals,"Great Christian Revivals is a fact- and spirit-filled documentary detailing the movement of the Holy Spirit through Wales, the New Hebrides, and other parts of Great Britain.The film concentrates on those who were called upon to start the Revivals, followed by how the Spirit of the Lord moved throughout His people to establish His presence upon them and their community.For example, during the Hebridean revival it was usual for Coal Miners to attend Church until the early hours of the morning, leave to go directly to work, but be so still under the influence of the Holy Spirit that they would fall to their knees along the roads and pray to God for more of Him.If you want to see just how the Lord can move when we let him, then I recommend this DVD for your Spirit and your edification. Don't miss it!"
2,Great Christian Revivals,"This video was a Great disappointment. It is poorly put together and extremely low budget. buy a good book on revival instead, dont waste your money. Better yet, download some free sermons by Campbell from SermonIndex.com."
2,boring,unless you're really into these dances this movie could be boring for you - hardly worth paying much attention to - I tried but fast forward helped a lot.
5,Fantastic -- loved it!,"This is probably one of Richard Gere's best performances in a love story. We both really loved his, Jennifer's and Susan's performances -- they were quite a team. And the dancing was outstanding!"
4,"Faithful to the Original, but a Little Too Much Spice","Being a huge fan of the original Japanese movie, I had to see what America did with it. I was pleased to find an enjoyable movie that was faithful to the original story while not being afraid to add to it a bit. Some things don't translate well to an American setting, though (middle-aged guys being bashed for ballroom dancing? really???), and the intimate dance between Richard and Jennifer ruined the innocence that makes the Japanese movie so special while destroying any believability that the main character was a dancer that had been studying for only a few months. Finally, they dropped the F-bomb at the end of the movie, which I felt was crude and unnecessary. That said, I still give it 4 stars."
2,Nope,"I was not into this movie at all. My mother recommended it to me but it was lame all the way through. A middle-aged man decides he wants to do something different with his life, so he takes a dance class. Ofcourse there's a fine dance instructor, a crush is pursued, a wife gets jealous, hires a detective, and *gasp* his crush is found out. The movie was too predictable and it just wasn't for me. Not a bad movie, just not my cup of tea. Richard Gere was cute as usual, which was the only thing that made me watch it to the end, besides wanting to know what a correct quick step looked like since ""So You Think You Can Dance"" never had contestants who mastered it."
1,Feel sorry for it,"i would have given it two stars had i not watched the original Japanese version. i simply feel sorry for those big stars who took part in this third-rate copy. Watch the original one and you will see what ""elegance"" means."
4,Shall we DANCE well Let's,Seen this movie with the wife an it really is a good story that allows the guys point of view to come across. Yes this is a happy feel good movie with alittle ball room and it was done quite well. (Kind of a chick flick) but hey ya gotta take the wife to a few of these a year. Sit back and enjoy.
3,I enjoyed it in spite of myself,"This movie clearly is a big piece of fluff, but it has some warm, fun moments that make it much more palatable than I would have expected.Gere is charming here. It's nice to see him smile in movies these days. Sarandon, as is often the case, rises above the flimsy material. Anita Gillete (I know!) is kind of a hoot and Tucci contiues to be a scene stealer. Oh yeah, JLo is in it too."
2,Heavy-handed & lacking delicacy,"I really enjoyed the Japanese original and expected this would at least be fun but... Richard Gere doesn't strike anyone as an anonymous cube dwelling workaholic (ok - PLEASE - enough of the product placements in their big expensive McMansion, right?). And... that was Jennifer Lopez? I don't know what I expected, honestly. Perhaps the part wasn't really well written. Stanley Tucci put in the best performance in the entire movie. Even the dance bits weren't that exciting or inspiring... blah. Stick to the original!"
2,"If you saw the original, you probably will not like this version.","Ignorance is bliss. I'm pretty sure that if I did not see the Japanese version first, I would have enjoyed the American version a little more. The American version is very light fare. The movie has its good moments, but on the whole it isn't a great movie. All the performances were okay. I just wished Jennifer Lopez didn't look so...constipated. Yes sexy as usual, but in trying to look distracted she missed the mark for me. But I am comparing Mrs. Lopez's performance to the Japanese Version's counterpart. The Japanese version was a longer movie, and the characters were well established. Here in the American version it was like ""quicker, faster, cheaper"" but not necessarily better.But of course if you didn't see the original, you probably came away with a better liking of this movie.C'est la vie!"
2,"Enjoyable, but pales in comparison to the original version.","I feel the original Japanese version of ""Shall We Dance"" had much more depth to the characters and the ballroom dancing sequences were much more elaborate as the actors actually appeared skilled in their dancing (not so much in the remake). I would highly recommend seeing the original to see what this remake was lacking.The newer version with Richard Gere and J-Lo had a lot of quick editing in the dance sequences and the dancing did not seem as refined. Also Stanley Tucci's role was cute, but his counterpart in the original, Mr. Aoki was downright hilarious. I hope Hollywood stops trying to remake Asian movie hits....Tortilla Soup was very watered down compared to the original ""Eat Man, Drink Woman"" and the Hollywood version of ""Shall We Dance"" shows many ""missed steps"" compared to the original."
1,WISH I'D SEEN THE MOVIE BEFORE BUYING,"This is a poor, nasty, in my mind, copy of the original.japanese version. No class! No class! No class! No class!"
5,Fun movie,The whole family enjoyed the movie - it's one of my wife's favorites. Perhaps we'll see the original Japanese version one of these days.
4,Even J Lo is likeable.,"Your basic modern romantic comedy. Richard Gere is an attorney in Chicago, happily married to Susan Sarandon but confused. Something is missing that he can't confide to her. He finds something totally outside his experience, his family & wife: Ballroom dancing. Dancing can be very sexy especially with a teacher like Jennifer Lopez. She is toned down here & very modest but still beautiful. Gere is attracted to her. But there's no hanky-panky. Jusy sexy dancing. The usual complications & misunderstandings ensue & they are all worked out. It's a date movie, maybe even a chick flick, (Gere is a good-looking dude). See it with you wife or girlfriend. It won't hurt. Really."
3,I don't really feel like dancing very much..,"I will say straight off that I've never seen the Japanese version, so I can't do any comparing. This movie didn't hold my interest well the entire time. I thought the casting could have been much better. I like Jennifer Lopez, but I thought Richard Gere didn't do much for the movie. I saw no chemistry between him and Jennifer when they were dancing. I really wish they would have casted someone of Jennifer's background, I think there would have been so much more chemistry in that case (it wouldn't have to be someone of her background, just someone that Jen would have more chemistry with) The acting was average, I didn't feel much from any of the characters. Overall, I think this should be rented because it's not in the ranking with Jennifer's other movies."
3,Good Film,"This movie is not really bad at all...sort of predictable in my opinion...so you know what is going to happen and why it happened. It was a good natured film, I would recommend it for anyone...even the kids...even though it is a Pg-13 rating, I see no problem with a kid under 13 watching this film, and I am a father of a 9 year old...great choregraphy in the film as well.Wish I could have seen a better acting performance from J Lo.Blonde lady in the film is really funny!!!"
4,"Funny, Cute and a good time.","I honestly didn't want to see this movie. But it was the only movie that my friend and I hadn't seen. After we started watching it I was in love. It was cute and funny. I loved Jennifer Lopez in only one of her movies The Wedding Planner, but I think she did a good job in this movie. Richard Gere is just great although I would never say this is his best movie. And Susan Surandon was wonderful. I know there were times in this movie that it was just dumb but as a movie over-all it was a good time.The only aspect of the movie I didn't like is the hidden romance that Gere and Lopez have. Not sure why they had to add that in if he loved his wife so much. But it still doesn't take away the movies passion.I think this movie is for you if you like dancing, romance,and chick flicks."
2,Okay for a second rate remake.,"This might be a good movie if you've never seen the original. If you want to see a comedy. Or if you like J-Lo and Richard Gere. But if you have had the opportunity to see the original, you may be sadly disappointed. I loved the original. It was a very moving drama. I thought this one was okay with a few scenes worthy of a chuckle. But the scenes taken from the original was horrid at best. And there you have it in a nutshell. See the original."
1,Please,"It's two fading stars (Sarandon and Gere) and a fresh faced newcomer (Lopez) starring in the only movie I have ever walked out of. This is crap. We've seen it all before.Happily, after I left, the waitress at Denny's kept me on my toe's.Really, I left the theatre. And I was the only one in the theatre. I was so uncomfortable with all concerned I had to leave.Ergo, the Ultimate Omelette.I know that in the great somewhere some idiot thought that the combination of Gere and Sarandon and Lopez would make a good movie. It's crap. Like REAL CRAP. The whole thing was ghastly. He loves/She loves/He decides to dance to woo his wife back/the teacher loves him/he has feelings for her....It all winds up in a tasty omelette served by a tired and overworked waitress. At Denny's.More coffee?"
2,"Stanley Tucci, BRAVO!","Stanley Tucci saved this film from a 1 star rating. He & Richard Gere's other male dance students, Miss Mitzi, the detective & his hiliarious assistant made the movie fun!! Otherwise, it was a dud.The marriage of Gere & Sarandon had no chemistry. That the wife & stupid kid showed up & ruined his big day, stunk.Jennifer Lopez is mesmerizing to watch, beautiful as always, but they stuck her in a corner! It was a crime and a waste of Lopez's tremendous screen presence."
1,oh no.,"Rather than typing out a long explaination behind my ""oh no,"" let's keep this short and sweet. Basically, about half way through the movie I got bored and started surfing the net.But at least it opened up some some time for me to bookmark some stuff for my Amazon wishlist, write an overdue email to Mom and update my blog.On a side note, Richard Gere's lack of facial expression was a bit alarming.Only watch if you think you need an excuse to free up some time for internet surfing."
3,So-So,"Not particularly moving or life-changing but an alright way I suppose to pass two hours of your life. Well-acted (especially Stanley Tucci), but Jennifer Lopez's mysterious sadness act was sort of hokey. John Clark's (Gere)fourteen year old daughter is an annoying self-centered brat whose completely unnecessary actions bring embarrassment to her dad's dancing partner, and they could have done the film without her. Maybe he took up ballroom dancing to get away from this kid, not his wife.One of those ""all's well that ends well"" type movies."
2,An O.K. movie - definitely missing something,"I enjoyed the music and the dancing - not enough of it though - it was pretty to look at and enjoyed the premise of the ballroom dancing scene - However,after digesting the crux of the movie it seems really silly - True love for his wife but secret desire to dance? Why hide taking dancing lessons? Gere never came across as really loving anyone but himself - there just was not any chemistry between either women to me. Middle age women loved the end - however, to keep hidden so long from his wife the dance lessons and his new set of friends seems suspect - I have not seen the original film - perhaps the Japanese culture better explains this premise - but not in the United States -As I originally stated - good movie for the music and dancing - enjoy it for what it is - but something definitely missing in the common sense department."
1,Don't waste time. Just watch the original Japanese version,"After seeing years ago 1995 Japanese original I was willing to give it a chance. But what a horrible remake! Not to mention, dancing and music choices are even worse. Practicing supposedly classic ballroom waltz (or whatever it was meat to be...) to an Argentine Tango tune from GOTAN project just kills it entirely for anyone who has at least something to do with dancing. Solo danced by J-Lo had to be in cuts.... Is Hollywood no longer capable to produce anything meaningful and on their own?"
3,Not as good as I hoped,"It wasn't bad, I just hoped for more I guess. There were a few scenes that came across as plain silly and ridiculous thus making it hard to watch at times. Richard Gere tries hard but I thought Lopez's performance was best, really quiet and understated. Susan Sarandon's role wasn't very challenging, for an actress that talented, you'd have thought they'd have given her more."
4,"Delightful, fun, and sexy...","I have just returned from a sneak preview of this film. I must say, I thoroughly enjoyed myself, as evidently did the rest of the sold-out audience. This version is simply 'different' than the Japanese original. Not better, not worse. I laughed, I cried, I was swept away by the dancing, and all the characters were memorably charming. Richard Gere can still send me swooning, and his dance moves aren't bad either! I recommend this film, but only if you want to have a super good time..."
3,SHALL WE.....WATCH THE ORIGINAL?,"What would I do to make this a better film. Hmmmmmm let's see.....ok.....first I'd probably loose all the well known stars and replace them with unknown actors and actresses. Yes I would do that first. Then.....um....I'd probably change the language and add subtitles so I could be sure to not let insipid dialogue get in the way. This would also mask the poorly written script. Now what else would I do......I'd probably change the location to Japan and add the unique cultural aspect to help reinforce the esscense of the story. So....let's see....with all those changes what would we have......I'll tell you....the poigiant, moving, better acted, better directed, better.....better.....better ORIGINAL MASTERPIECE! Why the hell would anybody want to see this tepid, shallow, anemic copy of the original other than they possibly didn't know that one existed. Buy or rent the original Japanese version without hesitation today!"
2,Not my kind of movie,it was not my kind of movie. I guess I thought it would be more like Pretty Woman. it wasn't....
5,Romantic,I have watched this a couple of times and it is one of my favorites. My husband likes the older version. This is one of the rare movies where the husband loves his wife so much and is devoted to her. It was a very happy movie.
5,shall we dance,love richard gere- had remembered how much i liked this movie-- so added to collection- fast ship and good cd.
3,It's Great for fans of Richard Gere,"I bought it as a gift. She watches it alone, and can't get enough of him."
4,Shall We Dance? I'd Be Delighted!,"""Shall We Dance?"" should be required to include this statement: ""WARNING: This film can be habit forming"". The dancing is wonderful and the music mesmerizing - especially ""Santa Maria"", the song used in a tango sequence. The poignant story focuses on a successful middle-aged attorney who, although a happy family man, is wondering if this is all there is. Chance brings him to a failing dance studio where he emerges the star dancer in his class of three appealing adult male students.This editor is not a fan of the three major actors in this film. However, each performed well and deserve credit for helping create a film that can be likened to the Energizer Bunny: It just keeps going and going (around in one's head).For its genre, this film deserves five stars but five should be reserved for a magnificent effort such as ""Saving Private Ryan""."
3,Worthy but inferior remake,"I didn't think I'd like this movie very much since I had seen the original (Japanese version) much earlier and loved it so much. I don't think I'm being unfair in my assessment of this remake, despite my prejudice. The cast is worthy of much better, and the dance scenes, though brief, were not bad, but the overall reason I give this only 3 stars is because the main theme of the original ""Shall We Dance"" was that the man hides his lessons from his wife because in Japan public dancing is considered obscene or shameful; that's not the case in America and I don't feel they really gave a good excuse why Richard Gere would hide his lessons from Susan Sarandon - thereby negating the reason for the movie - other than trying to cash in on a Japanese success. I gave one extra star to the overall rating for the dialogue between Susan Sarandon's character and the detective when she describes what marriage meant to her."
5,Elegant and Inspiring,"This film just made me want to join a dance class straight away! Jenninfer Lopez is stunning in this film. I love the outfits, the plot, the actors. Gorgeous.If you want a film that has romance, passion, humour, this film is for you.Go on, buy it, you know you want to!"
5,I won't bore you....,"I won't bore you with the plot of the movie or the actor's names. I loved this movie, I rented it, took it back to the rental center and bought it. The alternate beginning and dance scene of Gere and Lopez are worth the price of admission, and by the way, it is a SEX scene and the reason for the plot.Gere wasn't bored with his life, he saw a beautiful face in the window and he wanted to met her. The supporting characters give the movie a huge boost, and the movie moves along as it is supposed to with only one or two moments where I felt the urge to go to the kitchen. Soon I will take up ballroom dancing because of this movie. Please, enjoy."
5,fantastic!,I found this movie just amazing i thought it was an excellent storyline about a man (richard Gere) was a loving husband to susan surandon who decided to try out a dance school with Jennifer Lopez who also was a dance teacher i just have to say it was a very warm and extremely touching movie all i can say is go see it it was fantastic and again when it comes out on dvd i will deffinately go buy it it was a tear jerker and such a warm moviego see it!!!!
4,well worth the price,Older edition but still relevant especially for a DSLR beginner.The basic information is good. A separate chapter on white balance.Would be better if there are more examples.
2,Not That Useful,"I read Sheppard's book primarily with the hope of better understanding what an SLR would offer vs. a quality point-and-shoot digital camera, and what various lens might offer, given a particular SLR. ""PCPhoto Digital SLR Handbook"" provided neither.Probably the simplest way of accomplishing this would have been to provide comparative photos using an SLR vs. simpler camera with standard settings, and differing SLR photos using various lens settings - along with an explanation."
5,SUPERB AFROBEAT MUSIC,"A rare album with excellent musicianship ,rythm and virtouosity.Among the best afrobeat recordings ever released ."
5,"Tensors, Relativity, and Cosmology by Mirjana Dalarsson",An excellent introductory book to this exciting subject. Covers all neccessary calculations to master the subject easily. Strongly recommended to all students new to this subject as well as to researchers who need to refresh the technical skills in this subject.
5,Excellent Advice,"Many thanks to Lynette Harris for making this advice available! Good sound suggestions for marketing the business, pricing, as well as advice on contracts and suggestions on how to choose your business name and much more. Good food for thought! I highly recommend this book for anyone who may be considering going into this field of business!"
1,I was RailRoaded,"I bought 6 pair, with the intent of wearing a different pair to work each day, Monday thru Saturday. I bought these in December. This means that I wore each pair about 6 times thus far. I have had to throw 4 individual socks away from total rips. I have three others with holes already. As for the rest, you can barely tell that they are even socks. They are completely stretched out, and look like an overused dog's toy....The name is very fitting!!!!"
5,I love them so much that I have 4!,"I love these Hugger Mugger pranayama pillows! I bought my first one 4 years ago after open lung surgery. I used it to open up my lungs. Even after 4 years of use (and abuse), it is in excellent condition! I use it lengthwise under my spine to relax as I open my lungs at night before retiring. I use it crosswise under my shoulders/neck/thoracic spine when I need to release muscle tension. I also use it lengthwise down the spine for reclining hero's pose!I have purchased 3 more to keep in my bedroom so that I can have a superb relaxation time in supported baddha konasana before retiring. I will put one lengthwise for my spinal (lung) opening and one under each thigh (near the buttocks) to support my legs in baddha konasana (with a 10' strap to hold my feet in place). This is absolute relaxation..IMHO!I am seriously considering buying a 5th so that I can have 2 in my exercise room (downstairs)."
5,Wonderful spine support!,"This yoga pillow is absolutely FANTASTIC. What a wonderful prop for relaxation time after yoga. It supports my entire spine and allows my chest and shoulders to open and relax.As with other Hugger Mugger pillows that I have reviewed, this one has a HANDLE on it so you can grab it easily ... woo hoo! (Hugger Mugger, you think of everything!)I especially enjoy free shipping from Amazon on these pillows, as they are quite heavy and would rack up a substantial shipping charge on other sites.Enjoy!"
5,Great for opening the front,"I used one of these for the first time during a yoga class and liked the way it supported my spine, opened my front and let my shoulders fall back, where they're supposed to be. I ordered one from Amazon and have used it every day since. Great for pranayama and savasana, especially after sitting most of the day."
5,Doesn't he always come with the greatest books????,"Carl Weber does it again. Now the bad part is waiting a whole year..AGAIN...for the next book. Then,in the mean time reading books by other authors that don't quite make the cut!!"
5,"WOW, What a book?","You must read this book. The lives of the three men depicted in this book will make you think seriously about cheating, living a lie, and moving in with men you think you know! I read this book in one evening, I could not put it down! Well written, and Carl Weber kept it REAL!"
4,Trying to find air...,"I couldn't figure out this book and I loved every minute of the not knowing or suspecting!!! I was left speechless at the end. GREAT read!!! The characters are not at all who they seem to be! I would recommend this book to anyone who loves drama, suspend and/ or who simply loves to read!"
2,Odd Man Out,"I guess I am the odd man out on this one. I thought the writing was juvenile and boring. And no every book is not to be ""literature"", but I found myself skipping through chapters just to get to the end. And now finishing, just think he had so much opportunity to write it better. He kept referring to sex as ""put it in""...I was left thinking, who talks let that, let alone, what man talks like that. I also did not like how he took advantage of larger women by almost making it seem the one way she could get a man was to pick one who turns out to be gay and then after all the drama still stuck with him. He just conjured up all the stereotypes that heavy women don't have choices for a good man and that they are always concerned about their weight and threatened by smaller women. I was surprised by the number of stars this one received."
2,"So typical, no surprises on some characters",well everything in the beginning was choppy and he gave the wrong character the longest chapters you had to be dumb if you didn't know brent was gay and jackie was a man. james was cool. it would have been nice to know more about sonny and what made him that way. james and his situation was good the story line was good. but it seems that the arthur didn't really want to write anything good about a straight couple thats what bother me the most that the married man was cheating and the other was crazy and the gay was a cover up. now i don't know that much about the arthur but thru his writing him seems gay its seems to be written all in the writing no women in this book got anything positive out of their situation/ so that kind of lets me know that he might be gay. cause he took more time describing the men to the tee. this book should be called the gay with sidekicks lmao. i would not buy this book. im glad i only borrowed it
5,Everything a book should be....,"I had never written to an artist in my life. But now, I had to write Mr. Weber himself and let him know he launched himself into the stratosphere with his latest book. To say ""I loved it"" is not a strong enough expression.I have over 70 ""black"" novels. The authors are everyone from Eric Jerome Dickey to Mary Monroe to Valerie Wilson Weslie. This book replaced previous novels off of my ""favorite"" list. ""So You Call Yourself a Man?"" was everything a good book should be. I started reading it yesterday at 5:00 and I finished it today. It was intriguing, to say theleast. The shock value was worth the price of the book. It made me laugh and cry. My new favorite author. Ican't wait until his next book."
3,Entertaining...,"I just read this book.Yes. Its well written. There are some unexpected twists in the storyline.However, I was not happy with the the characters of the movie.All the main characters face personal-problems, during the entire plot.I was kinda expecting some humour, romance and a happy ending.The feel-good factor is missing.I guess the author was trying to say, how a man screws up his married life,if they do not behave like a MAN.But the Carl Weber is very capable of writing great Entertaining stories.He narrates, very well.I have not read, ""Preachor's son"", yet. ( awaiting to read ).Vassy"
3,Why ..Why..,I got the book to see if i could get into Carl Weber the way i got into other authors boy was i in for a horrible surprise. This book had me almost into mild depression. Dont get me wrong some parts of the book was good but it was to much DRAMA for my taste and it would of being ok if it was at least one happy ending. I mean come on i wish he would of held back a little i take that back a lot more it was simply to much going on. This was not my first Carl Weber book the other 3 i read were actually ok i just dont know what went wrong in the writing process. I hope he do better in the future. I guess thats what i get for trying to broaden the authors i read instead of sticking to my 3 favorite authors that i will not name.
4,Odd Character Development,"Overall, this is a pretty entertaining read, but I was just a bit thrown off by the development of the characters. It felt like the characters' personalities just totally changed throughout the story. To the point where it became unbelievable. I think the author was going for a ""people are not always as they seem"" vibe but it was just plain weird. Other than that, Weber didn't disappoint with the entertaining drama!"
3,Huge Fan of Carl not a fan of this book (especially the end),"Like others said in the beginning this book was great, I even like the sultry side of it but end the end he really did disappoint me by trying to add to much drama and foolery. Total waste of my time reading this book. Had I known it would turn up like this in the end I would have never picked it up in the first place. But that's the thing about all of Carl's books he sucks you in but can't seem to deliver a good realistic end. Any other author would have gotten 2.5 stars but because it's him and there is no 1/2 stars he gets 3. I'm being lenient though."
4,Great read,"Carl Weber is a great writer, he's done it again!!!!!If you havent picked up any of his other books i highly suggest you do so"
3,Definitely a Twist!,This book was very entertaining and a definite page turner. It had a lot of twists and turns. This is my second book by Mr. Weber and this one was oh my goodness his most interesting yet. Don't want to give the book away but get ready for some shocks and twists you would have never expected. Way to go Mr. Weber continue gracing readers with wonderful reads like this and you'll never be broke.The Twin
4,Rollercoaster Ride!!,I am late reviewing this one. This is the second book I read by the author I believe. I could see the Mary Monroe-ness of it all throughout the book. It was engaging and had a great ending.Cop it!!
2,Unsettling....,"I do agree with the others that I enjoy all of Carl Weber's writings. The Preacher's Son has definitely earned its New York Bestseller's award. However, So You Call Yourself A Man has left me dumbfounded and speechless, and not in a good way. Having read at least one hundred novels in my young lifetime, I know that I have just read a good novel when I am left wondering about characters long after reading the last page. With this book, however, I was glad that it was over so that the intense and overwhelmingly sad drama could be over. With Weber's other books, the drama is tolerable enough to end with a good twist, but rest for the characters. This book ends with unrest for the characters, and the reader as well. This was definitely not a favorite for me. Better luck next time! Still love Carl Weber though!"
3,So Much Drama,"I have tried to read a couple of Weber's other books and was so bored with the first chapters that I had to put them down. This one though, I had high hopes for after reading chapter one and continued to read voraciously until bam! Say what? I thought the twists were so unrealistic. But buffoonery will keep pages turning and I, unfortunately, have to admit that I had to find out what happened to these guys. I remember Weber saying in an interview that his audience wanted more drama and in this book you'll definitely get it. However if you'd like a more serious take, check out my bookJERKS TO GENTLE MEN."
2,Allright........,I have read all of Mr. Weber's books. Married Men was the best.I ejoyed all of his books. I buy his books without question.So you call yourself a man was not a good read. It was so so.I know that Carl can do better. There was a surprise in the book. Overall I was let down.
5,WOW....this just reaffirms why I love Carl Weber,Oh my god!!!!! this book was off the chin...Seriously!!!!! half way through the book my much just dropped open!!!..but now i realized I should have read The preachers son first...ive had it for close to a year and for some reason its like ive been saving it. but i will get on that ASAP...cant wait until the First Lady comes out.
5,Carl Weber equals drama,This was a great Carl Weber Novel. I believe this is his best novel to date. His characters are life like and full of drama. The storyline of the crazy boyfriend was great!! I knew something was wrong with him.
5,A Literary Treat,As always Carl delivers another literary treat or snack. It's just enough and too much at the same time. He always leaves you wanting for more and more. So You Call Yourself A Man is no different. You have James who should have just told his wife the truth especially since he loved her and the boys so much. You have Brent who to me is a Dayuum fool and you have psychopath Sonny. And Jackie well that homewrecker is too much. This novel still shows us that Carl Weber is still on top of his game.
5,I Loved It!,"I loved ""So You Call Yourself A Man"". The secret about Jackie was a total shock! I read it in two days. Keep up the good work Mr. Weber. I can't wait for ""The First Lady"".N. StewartFounder/Moderator of 4 Sistas OnlyMD Book Club"
5,Good G*t Damn!!!,"THIS BOOK WAS DEFINTLY THE BOMB THESE GUYS EACH HAD THEY OWN DRAMA,THAT KEPT ME TURNING PAGE AFTER PAGE. I READ A COUPLE OF CARL WEBER BOOKS AND I HAVE TO SAY THIS ONE KEPT ME ENTERTAINED. I LOVE A BOOK THAT CAN KEEP ME LAUGHING AND SAYEN OH S**T!!! THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ!!"
5,First time and I'm hooked,"I have had So you call yourself a man on audio book, for two years and just now got around to listing to it. Omg amazing, I have a new favorite author."
3,A Very General Overview,This book was a little too general for me. I was looking for more specific information.
3,basic,If you all ready own your lab... you will all ready know everything in this book. I would purchase this for someone thinking about buying a lab.
2,Nothing here that you won't find elsewhere,"It was a good book to read, but it had NOTHING on training a lab how to retrieve. It gave a few instructions on basic dog commands, but I found similar tips in many other books. If you are looking for a guide to training your lab, this isn't for you."
3,Great Book ...Missing information,"I ordered this book based on all the reviews thinking that this was the one and only Lab book needed.... I have 2 PureBreed Labs and in speaking both with my Vet and other breeders thought I may have a litter. This book does not support the idea of breeding or yet the reproductive aspects of the Lab at all. If someone plans to own a Lab just for a pet and doesn't intend to ever think of it's reproductive health or need that information then yes..... this is a SUPER book! I agree with the author's advice about neutering and spaying to keep the population down, however feel for this to be called the only book you'll ever need... I disagree. Look else where for the reproductive information on your beloved pet! The format and layout of the book as well as the reading material is better than most books I've read. I will now be looking for yet more books on breeding."
5,Maximum Self-Esteem,Great book!It offered lots of information and shows you how to get in touch with your inner self and organize.It makes you think and take action.Teaches you how to remove self doubt and makes you realize that you are a person that can make a difference in your own life as well as others.
5,This book helped me considerably.,"I picked this book up and was very happy that I did. I read the Part One all the way through and then started to pick and choose areas that I needed to work on, as Jerry Minchinton suggested. I read the chapters that I needed help on throughly, like the chapter on Needing Approval. I have modified and picked through the affirmations and used what I need. Some of the chapters I skimmed and skipped the negative qualities of the attribute, and went on to the positive discussion and the affirmations. I found that for myself this is just what I needed and am very happy with this book and re-read sections as needed."
2,Scary for female readers,"Short and sweet. If you are a woman seeking self esteem, look elsewhere. Basically advocates the put-everyone-else's-needs-first and the feel-better-by-making-everyone-else-feel-better approach to life. I found myself thinking that this was how I got into this mess in the first place."
2,Scary for this male reader as well,"This book had some helpful ways towards improving self-esteem (particularly the chapters on Religion and Helping Others) but put a huge amount of blame on the reader for his/her problems. I could not recommend this book to anyone, because it is true that it encourages one to blame oneself for all one's problems and is not realistic. Dr. Susan Forward has a much healthier way of handling problems. She states clearly that we are not responsible for damage done to us, especially during childhood; we are responsible for taking charge of our own lives as adults. Instead of encouraging readers to disregard emotional pain and believe that they choose to accept it, Susan encourages us to get angry over what people have done to us. It is a great way to turn anger into grief and into healing. Three cheers for Susan Forward! If you are intent on improving your self-worth, ignore this book and go for books by Susan Forward and Lillian Glass."
5,ON FIRE! Burns Within ME!,"This is the absolute peak of Petra's rock career. This CD defines John Schlit's highest level of achievement as the band's lead singer.Jekyl and Hyde is a harder rockin CD, but ON FIRE! sets the pace."
2,not up to par,"with cursive's other CDs. This is my least favorite album from cursive, I just can't listen to it! I couldnt imagine that was possible after loving the Ugly Organ, Burst and Bloom and Domestica, but this CD just doesnt compare to those other albums."
2,listeners above age 20: pass this one up,"this album sounds like the radio version of fugazi. bubble gum fugazi. high school punk. their later albums such as ""Ugly Organ"" and ""Burst and Bloom"" which are beautiful and original, you can't help but loose your mind over and playing live they ROCK! but this one, sorry kids, is a flop..."
3,High highs with low lows,"The jolted introduction into Cursive's abrasive romanticism could only be an acquired taste, with Kasher's organs-on-sleeve scream/sing doing nothing to embrace less adventurous listeners. The first few songs are deceptively good and make much of the following all the more obviously strained or forgettable."
1,Used up in a half hour!,"These tubes are great and easy for my two- and four-year-old to use, but they're so little, that the colors were used up in less than a half hour. The glitter glue comes out too fast."
1,Pass on this one,"Buy some of the earlier stuff. This one is a rehash, lacking in spontanaiety and musicality.I particularly like Zenith: 1993. Get that instead."
5,Excellent hand cream!,"I have tried almost everything out there for dry hands, especially after lots of hand washings. This is the best product I've tried. I keep a tube by every sink and in every bedroom. Highly recommend."
5,My first purchase will not be my last,"I received my plates in excellent condition, and they were delivered before the set date.My current plated are about 15 years old, these new plates are somewhat darker but, I still will nothave problem placing them along side the old."
2,They don't sit flat.,"It is the pattern I have and wanted to match, but the plates weren't properly made. They were seconds sold as firsts. I needed them at the time and therefore kept them, but I'm not happy with them. They don't even sit right in the dishwasher."
5,Thrilled,"Well packed and promptly shipped, these dinner plates are beautiful with a shape that make them quite unique. We will enjoy the Nikko Christmas Tree plates this holiday season."
2,Phillips Ambi-Sound sound bar,"The remote won't control other things, including my TV. My universal remote won't control the sound bar. There isn't a code that will work. The tone is good when playing a DVD or listening to the radio. The tone is not so good when listening to TV. I didn't notice any surround sound when playing a DVD or when listening to the TV. If I had a chance to listen to it before buying it, I would not have bought it."
2,Remote does not work,The sound is actually great and at the price I paid would have been a good value if everything worked. The remote will not turn on the system. Once you manually turn on the remote it works and will turn off the system. I went to an electronics store and found that the remote on the demo model will not turn their system on either. The response from the manufactures was quick but they offered no solution that worked and it came down to either send it to a repair shop or return it.
3,"Not horrible, not great. Not worth $500 +","I purchased this system at BJ's wholesale for $500, which in my personal opinion, I expect pretty good sound for that price considering my last system was half that and sounded great for the time. This thing really never prodiced surround sound, so do not be expecting a surround sound experience too much. It was loud and the subwoofer wasn't bad, but overall I had wished that the clarity of the sound was better. Another big issue for me was that there are no video inputs on it. What this meant for me was that I could not run HDMI from my cable box and get the surround sound through it from HD cable. I was forced to use the standard red and white RCA jacks for my TV sound. The only time you will receive surround sound will be from DVD's.The upscaling looked decent, but it was the first time I had ever seen upscaling, so I don't know how to compare. Anyway I returned the system and bought a Samsung surround sound system for $200 less and am much happier."
2,sound quit working after 2 years :(,AT first it took longer and longer for the sound to come back on after powering it down. Then one day it quit working. It seems this is problematic with this device. I need something thin and long to stick on a fireplace mantel under the tv and this is it. it wall mounts. but it has a sound defect problem and most likely I will complain to the manufacturer...although after 2 years? I wish someone made a better one with the same design. I like have the dvd player built in like this
1,DVD seems to fail at 30-60 days,"Too bad. Loved the look and the simplicity inherent with this system, but really surprised and dissappointed when the DVD ceased to function after only 2 months. I was able to exchange it and hoped against hope that I had simply gotten a lemon. Sadly, two months later, my second unit (same model) is acting up again and the DVD works only about 50% of the time...think this is just a good looking dud"
2,No Optical In?,I was excited about this unit but ended up returning it when I discovered it has no optical input. Both of my HDTVs pass-thru sound via an optical output and that's really what I wanted from a unit. Next time I'll do a better job reading the specs!The reason I give the unit 2 stars is because I looked at 12 different HDTVs at the store and every single one of them had an optical out ONLY. To me this is a major flaw in the design of the unit and makes it ill suited to the designed purpose.
1,"This is one of the worst purchases I have ever made, this soundbar sucks!","I bought this soundbar about a year ago and I deeply regret buying it and I'm in the process of getting rid of it, I have nothing good to say about this machine, I mean, picture quality is good and sound is ok, but this thing will freeze 3 out of 10 times and I don't mean the DVD, NO!, I mean the whole machine will get stuck when I turn it on or when I'm trying to open the console to insert a DVD and I have to unplug it and plug it again so it will reset, I mean, WTF!!!!????, this was a $500 machine when I bought it and it works like a $10 piece of crap, if you want my advise, DO NOT BUY IT!, it may be that I have a lemon, but in all honesty, are you willing to take the risk?"
2,No sound cables,"This system does NOT play the sound from my TV. In the instructions it clearly states in step 3 of the setup guide ""Cables not included"""
1,Too much trebble. Very disappointed.,"Alrighty, hear is the thing. I bought this system not expecting great sound. You get what you pay for, and as long as it was as good as my Ipod speaker, I'd be happy. Well, it wasn't as good. So very tinney. This thing would give me a headache after just a half hour of listening. I sent it back and dropped a boat load of dough on Paradigm speakers, Oppo dvd and an Onkyo receiver. In all fairness, there is no comparing a $2000 system with a 6 hundi. It is just that, my expectations were not high with the $600 Philips, I really wanted to like this damn thing. It is beautiful in appearance, horrible in long term sound. I say long term, because if I heard this thing cranked up at an appliance store, I would be all, wooo whooo. Take it home and try and get through a couple of dvds without covering your ears. Seriously Philips, wtf? Go ahead and buy this thing if you want, then just try and listen to it for 4 hours without feeling ill."
1,Needs updating,"I do not recommend. It is in desperate need of an update. Additionally, I was told that it was compatible with Apple computers and it is not."
3,"Easy to use, but old and slow running","I purchased this cd for my 3y.o. son. He already knows how to use a mouse and knows some letters. This program will keep his attention for about 15 minutes at a stretch. I personally find the program to run really slowly, the graphics are clunky, and wish I had tried a demo before I bought it. I would recommend it to others looking for a cheap disc to keep the tots engaged for short spells while learning something useful. It works great to give me a chance to get dinner started."
1,A waste of $6.50,"This e-booklet should have been called ""Effective Listening for Managers."" Common sense dictates that listening to employees will help resolve a workplace conflicts. What else helps? You won't find out from this publication."
1,This is not a book,If you are expecting a book don't buy it!!! This a 14 pages brochure with a summary of conflict reolution.
1,How good is your PLO- apparently better than yours!,"I had to post a review because these reviews are highly suspect. This is not an analytical book on proper PLO play. The author uses very little analysis of why he made certain plays, and sometimes his answer is simply that he was bored. Yet he still docks the reader points if you chose to fold! Many instances in the book his answers are factually wrong (ex. page 97 he states that Ah, 3h, 5d, 6d is 50% against Qh,Qc,2s,2c on a board of 9h,4c,2h, your choices are 40-60% in increments of 5%, while they answer i got on my PLO calculator was 46.46%. Are we rounding everything up?). The only redeeming quality for this book is to spot obvious errors in his play. A much better book on the subject is Secrets of Professional PLO."
1,my collection,This book was short on technical information. It related how the author took long shots and got lucky
5,Great Anime,"I thoroughly enjoyed viewing this anime which adds a unique modern age twist beginning shortly in our recent past with flash backs given at the proper time to show what has occured and give more character depth; to continueing into the future and completing the story's arc. Overall a short, but a complete six episode series. As a side note, I would suggest at least 16+ for viewing this, but that falls to your culture and belief system."
4,Kids in bed?.....OK!,"If it weren't for the great story and the depth of the characters, this would have probably have recieved a more adult rating. But the story isn't about the sex and nudity. Its a horror mystery. The violence and blood flows freely. Torture, humiliation and pain is hidden around every corner. And then the mystery of why it keeps happening over and over! This ain't ""cartoons"", this is in your face ADULT anime! Enjoy!"
3,"Woah, too much guro","This anime is a thrilling modern mystery anime featuring an immortal detective babe. The plot centers on the sci-fi concept of the ""body exchange"" and the ethics of immortality. Those who live a thousand lives will have to die a thousand times. This show is the farthest from light-hearted. People die in this show in unimaginably gory methods, with profuse nudity and even guro in just the first episode. If you like this, check out the anime ""Mouse,"" which is also ""James Bond"" type anime with approximate fanservice but with much less violence."
2,"Wanted to like it, but got turned off...","I watched this on Netflix and was getting some amusement from it. The action scenes were okay, the plot was uh... I guess it was there. The fan service was typical but not unappreciated. But then I got to the torture scene. It may have been short, but I'll never know because I was instantly repulsed and decided to have it end right then and there. I can handle and even enjoy your typical action violence found in movies just fine, but I'm not one to appreciate the torture of women, or anyone really, except terrorists. Some people might be okay with it (which isn't really a good thing, but to each their own) but for me it was a deal-breaker. I'm glad I didn't pay for the DVD like I was going to a while ago.I won't give it one star because the animation was pretty decent and some of the characters were shallow but charming."
3,No Mac support,"I was excited when I saw this, but the absence of Mac support makes this one a no-no for me. I checked Kensington's web site, and you need Windows 98. It is also not clear if the USB connection is appropriate for Virtual PC running Windows 98 - this is a problem with the PocketPC, and prevents synchronising. Bottom line, don't buy this if you have a Mac, as it is probably not compatible. Oh, and by the way, no international power supply, only 110-120V.Shame, because it looks like a nice piece of equipment, and it's cheaper than the Sony equivalent."
4,Great !,"This picture frame is great. No hazzle with setup - put in the cd, a few clicks and it simply works. I took my pictures from my camera and made a nice little slide show - really cool. The only disadvatage: you cannot leave it on your desktop at work - such a cool device tends to disappear overnight..."
1,Do Not Use Kensington Photo Album,This item should not be used.People need to be warned NOT to load the software. It is NOT compatible with Microsoft and causes damage to the Operating system ('98 as well as XP). XP provides a warning but '98 does not. We have more damage to our operating system than any Virus I ever had. We are very unhappy with the product and will be returning it and possibly contacting an attorney.
3,"Good, but not great","The 5th season of Mission:Impossible was good but far inferior to the previous 4 seasons. The main problem is Lesley Warren, who is cute but way too young and unsophisticated for the IMF. She would be replaced the following year by Lynda Day George who fit in much better with the men of the IMF. Also a problem was the lack of use of Leonard Nimoy who, in many episodes, had little to do at all. Nimoy has related in various books how disappointed he was with the show and how he couldn't wait to get off Mission after this season.As others have previously said, the best episode of this set is ""The Killer"" guest starring Robert Conrad, a terrific episode.As usual I continue to be amazed by the CBS/Paramount lack of retrospectives or commentaries on any of the Mission DVD sets. This is one of the few classics of the 1960s with the majority of the cast still alive: how they can continue to release these sets with nothing extra is beyond me."
2,Update in content is needed,"Even though I was fascinated with the Mission Impossible Series when I was a child, they helped, in certain way, the government. They kept us believed on the good actions of our politics, and I think it really worked out. But now, this administration (Bush administration) uncovered out the crude reality. Lied us about the reasons to invade Iraq, torturing detainees' people in Guantanamo, miserable response to Katrina, etc. I think these Mission Impossible Series need to be updated according to the actual government actions."
4,A Fresh Look for Season Five!,"Mission Impossible - The Fifth TV Seasonbrings us fresh faces and a renewed sense of story. Gone is the portfolio of agents from which Phelps must chose, new are two new IMF agents, played by a very young & beautiful Lesley Ann Warren and rugged & handsome Sam Elliott (I think the budget didn't allow for his mustache:). As ""The Beatles"" modified their music to suit the times, Mission Impossible morphed in to the psychedelic '70's as well. This season has a very contemporary theme for its time while still carrying the intrigue of its core mantra.My one star deduction is that the DVD's are NOT picture discs as with the first four season set releases. Continuing on with picture discs would have been nice with the addition of two new members to the IMF. The discs are a plain gray, identical to 'The Untouchables' discs. Take care not to mix them up. Still, I'm very glad to have the whole season at a marketable price.~Sigh~, only CBS/Paramount............"
3,Mission Impossible Season 5 - fun trip down memory lane,"It's fun to see the old episodes and the characters. It would have been nice to see bonus features - behind the scenes, interviews with regulars and guest actors, etc. I like the episodes where you get a glimpse into some of the characters' pasts - like Jim Phelps' home town, Barney's brother trying to expose criminal corruption, etc. Peter Lupus' character Willy is strangely absent from many episodes, replaced by Sam Elliot as ""Doug"", a doctor. Seeing Leonard Nimoy in action is always fun."
1,Defective video - the ending is missing!,Only the first 38 minutes of the video are available - don't watch this unless you don't mind not knowing how it turns out!
2,The fire died out-I couldn't finish this book.,"Lisanne Norman's series had a high and a low point for me. Somehow I treaded past the first book Turning point and went on to the more interesting book after that, Fortune's Wheel. But, about 3/4ths of the way through Razor's Edge, I put the book down and never picked it back up. I was kind of sick of Leskas and when 3 person Leskas began appearing that was it for me. I guess I'm just a two-person traditonalist. Plus, the abilities of the telepaths are kind of hazy-you don't really know what they can do, exactly. I know that even they don't know all they can do, but still...Was it me or did Norman's writing get a bit mechanical? Carrie seemed to lose most of her personality. Overall, the series died out, going from interesting to tiring. Maybe her next book will lift it out of the dredge."
1,"Not beliveable, what so ever.","Romance and science fiction are fine together to a certain point, but I found that every one of Norman's books were pointless and stupid. It was like she was looking for length and got nothing but a bunch of loose ends and mundane plots. Human telepaths are not real, this ""Carrie"" chic was even less real. There was a war going on, but I saw no fighting. There was no science, just a bunch of bloody romance! The ""Turning Point"" was alright, it should have ended there though. I suggest for Norman to give it up! Somebody has to tell her that her writing stinks!"
4,"Great quality, reasonable installation, but fairly soft wood","I bought 3 sets of these closet systems and have been using them for ~2 years now. The installation was not a breeze but was reasonable. Took about 6 hours to hang each system, but I was careful about everything being straight and precise.Pros:- great customizability- great overall quality and everything is thought through well from a functionality and installation perspective- it looks fantasticCons:- the wood is actually pretty soft, so if you push too hard on it with small objects (e.g. move around hangers uncarefully on the bars), you can put dents in it. They are visible. If you have young kids, they can probably do some damage. If you're neat and careful, you won't have any issues."
4,Wall Board,"First, the 16"" model is available at Target for $479.99 (but we did have to pay a 5% sales tax)The instructions are reasonably straight forward but should be read very carefully and:(1) Make sure that you do not block any electrical outlets with the shelving by planning ahead and(2) If you can find studs do so, plastic anchors they supply are OK, but the whole system is cantilevered (that is no support on the floor) so you have to be in solid to the wall, especially at the one bracket end.(3) Finally when installing the tower brackets do make sure that they are the right distance apart AND in proper alignment to the top brackets that were the first step in installation, otherwise you might have the top shelf resting on only PART of the tower (it will work but not look ""finished.""Also, you will need a 10 foot ceiling to hang two clothes racks in the same bay, on an eight foot ceiling you will be out of luck there is just not enough vertical space to do it."
5,Pantry Organizer,"Beautiful workmanship, quality materials, the finish is smooth & sleek, all good (except the screws could be a little less brittle - heads broke off several). Easily reconfigured to fit your space/closet (if you have the spatial and design skills) although you'll need a saw (I used a jigsaw); power screwdriver is helpful too. Workmen were impressed with the solid wood and said it was the nicest looking closet system they'd ever seen (discerning female workmen, I might add). I'll be adding more systems as I work through the rest of the house."
5,The Wedding Bros,I saw this film at its New York Premiere and loved it. It is very funny and very well done. I highly recommend it.
5,Clearly Explains the Cornerstone of Real Estate Investing,"Investment alalysis is one of the cornerstones of real estate. There are many fine books on real estate investing, but this is the first one I have found that patiently, clearly explains the process of using numbers and formulas to evaluate real estate. I have been fairly successful in real estate for several years going on gut instinct, rather than using logical analysis. This book has enabled me to take that additional step to actually use concrete numbers to make decisions. Robert Goodman did not invent this information, but he clearly explains it in a fashion that is actually enjoyable to read. If you do not understand real estate investment and are ready to take the next step, I highly recommend this book."
5,A complicated field made easy to understand.,"Bob Goodman ""pulls together"" the four facets of the real estate investing world, getting each into the most simple of form. In reading the book, I was searching for information on how to estimate the profit on a house, after taxes and selling costs were paid, especially in reference to the various tax liabilities. Page 67 in this book is worth the cost of a bucket full of these books in learning the bottom line in the sale of a commercial, or residential venture in real estate. The entire book is filled with difficult things made simple.Dr. Alan C. Tibbetts"
1,Goodman put nothing into it!,"Goodman's secret to having an income stream is to write flimsy, useless books. After 38 years in the industry you would think he would spend more than an afternoon rehashing common knowledge.Large print, double spaced lines with common sense advice that you would know without reading the book left me angry."
5,Let's Go Rangers! Ahhh!,"The Rangers are the best, and this cd captures many of their greatest moments, buy it if you are a real ranger fan."
4,"great writing, terrible editing","The content of this book and the writing were great, but the editing was terrible. Sometimes the chapters end abruptly, other times there are terms mentioned that should be elaborated on (how about a glossary of terms?).I have read Meltzer's news letter off and on in the nineties but I still had troubles w/ some of the terms used. Also confusing was sometimes only the last names of wrestlers mentioned in stories were used.It would have also been nice for each chapter to include the date of death and approximate date of birth (or age) of each subject, and when the chapter was originally published in the news letter.Overall this book was very enjoyable, and Meltzer's knowledge and commentary is invaluable, it just would have been nice if a professional editor could have worked to make this book more accessible to the masses, and made the transistion from the news letter more seamless."
4,GREAT BOOK BUT minor gripes...,This book was pretty much top notch. dave meltzer is really great at writing for and about wresting. my only problem is there were some wrestlers in this that were already in other dave meltzer tribute books. it kind of feels like theyre put in as filler. its not bad enough that it ruins the books though. still an excellent read!!!
4,Another Strong Outing from Dave Meltzer,"A solid, well written work for those interested in the real people behind the characters of wrestling. A well considered foreword from Bret Hart showing how far things have come from the ""kay fabe"" days.Mr. Meltzer's book puts a very human perspective on the individuals who punish themselves physically and mentally and the unfortunate toll that befalls some of these athletes/entertainers. A very good read for those with even a casual interest in wrestling."
2,Ink dried up after weeks of no use,"I very seldom print in color but since my OfficeJet comes with it, I used it occassionally only to discover that after months of no use, the cartridges (both black and tricolor) have dried up. I don't know if I have misread the instructions anywhere re: ink cartridge maintenance, but it seems like such a big waste to have to replace your ink cartridges even though you hardly use them! These cartridges are not cheap (and you know that's where HP makes the money on selling DeskJets so cheap). Because of my low usage of color printing, I have not replaced them and don't intend to. Overall, was very disappointed and in fact, felt a little bit cheated."
5,Computer printer ink,I was very pleased to obtain the printer ink I needed without travelling around to find it and at a lower cost. The best part was that it was delivered right to my door.
5,Kochi Maru Affair,Those who have served in the military in the orient will feel the ring of truth in the surroundings in which this story is told.The story itself is full of action and an enjoyable read.It is a shame there are not more books available by this author.
5,basketball#23,i REALLY LIKE THE CHICAGO BULLS.I ALLWAYS WANT TO MY BASKETBALL NUMBER 23 JUST LIKE MICHEAL JORDAN
2,"Poor shipping, good price",I purchased 8 water filters. The shipping was VERY Slow. The packaging was poor - filters were just bouncing around inside a big box. Price was good. Will buy from here again if they can improve shipping.
4,"Good testimony, Good information",The book was a nice read. I enjoyed reading about his life in the first few chapters. I thought the content on the New age practices was a bit on the light side. Good book
5,Running Against the Wind,This was well written and informative; easy to read; facts are correct. I highly recommend this book about the Emergent Church/New Age apostasy.
3,Don't use for editing video!!!,"The video program is too compilcated. How you delete scenes is not easy; you have to hold the shift key and drag slider on the player to delete video. It goes too fast and you end up deleting video you do not want to delete. However, it is suprisingly easy to add music. All you have to do is drag and drop music file in project window, and decide where the music shows up in your project in the sequencer window. Use this product for the animator and sound editor. The animator is easy to use. And it is a blast to make 2-D cutout cartoons. The sound editor is cool because you can manipulate audio files to your pleasure. If you want video editing do not get this product. If you want a cheap way to create fun animation on a computer , This is exactly what you want!!!"
3,Warm and fuzzy reading,"Initially I found myself irritated by the style of writing and was preparing to be less than impressed with the whole book, however as I went on I found it harder and harder to put down. Sure the story was incredibly predictable, however that was one of the best features. You will be continuously trying to work out how and when the characters were going to get to that obvious fate and enjoy the journey along the way. It was a lovely feel-good book and it's easy to warm to the characters involved. Definitely a book for girls who want some warm and fuzzy romantic reading, just try to ignore some of the annoying narrative comments thrown in around the beginning!(I'd give this 3 and a half stars if I had the option)"
5,Excellent Read,"This was a fantastic book, very descriptive and dreamy. Who wouldn't want the same opportunities that Chloe had! I recommend this book for a escape and a lovely way to travel around the UK."
2,Old cartridge,"Prompt shipment. Unfortunately, it was an old cartridge and I got poor service from it. Better to buy in person, I think."
2,Not very happy with product,I am not sure if scientifically it is sanitizing any air but I smell some sort of burning aroma after turning ON unit. I thought this will go away after some uses. But it did not even after a month of use.
2,Only small information for the present time,"The work of Choki Motobu is very intersting, but the comments of the editor are not sufficient. The predominent part of the book shows only one charcoat figure on one page and a few words on the other page. There are no words about the basis of Motobus interpretation of Okinawan Karate. In the figures he shows a lot of sequences out of the kata naihanchi ( shodan, nidan, sandan) and some sequence of the Bubushi. He shows atacks to kKyusho points very exactly. But there is no explanation of the new editor, no comment. People who dont know the backround of the special content of Motobus techniques cannot understand the book.H,Kogel M.D., Professor of surgery, 5th Dan Karate ,Kobudo Renshi, Reg.Dir.IMAF Kokusai Budoin"
5,Okinawan Kempo,The book arrived at the anticipated time and was in the condition stated. I was very happy with this purchase. My husband loved his Christmas present.
3,Great historical reference,This is a short book but one that give you an insight of Motobu and how he trained. You will see many counters and few first strikes. He shows you how Okinawan Karate looked like. I would have liked to see more of his thoughts but it is a translation
5,love it !,"what i love most about our country are all the privileges that have been bestowed upon us by our fore fathers, one of them being freedom of speech among others.they shared their opinion with us as we have shared our opinion with others.people that have a problem with "" the inccident "" should just let it go...get over it! i have all the chicks cd's and this is one of their best cd's ever!!! there is not one song on it that i dont thoroughly enjoy:)for those that refuse to buy the cd due to their personal convictions are cutting off their nose to spite their face!!!! because they are missing out and we're not.and to the dixie chicks....job well done!"
5,6 stars is more like it.,I would like this CD even if I liked the President and all of the damage he has done to the United States of America. From reading the reviews here it looks like his popularity rating is somewhere below 10%.
1,Disappointing,"I've been a Dixie Chicks fan since I first heard Wide Open Spaces and I have all of their albums. Their political statements don't bother me so I have no grudge against them there. I just think that musically this was a very forgettable album. The only track I really liked was Voice Inside My Head, where Natalie really showed how strong her voice is. The others songs that were passable were The Long Way Around and Not Ready To Make Nice. I found Lullaby to be 6 minutes of boring repetition. I guess I prefer a more country/bluegrass/acoustic sound, most of the songs just didn't catch my ear. I also thought that the album photographs were really ugly."
2,ugh,"Actually had to shut this one off before the end. Maybe it was a bad mood or something, but the voices I fell in love with from previous work really started to grate on my nerves."
1,Three Drab Queens.,"If you think this album is selling for its quality, think again.It's selling because the Chicks figured out that picking fights with powerful politicians works for getting your name in the news."
1,More Contemporary Country Grabage,"My wife and I heard the Dixie Chicks on Good Morning America performing two of the songs from their new album. All of the political drama aside, the songs I heard were nothing more than contemporary pop country garbage. My wife, who is more of a Chicks fan than I agreed that it did not even sound like their type of music. Their first two albums showed merit and a touch of true country style. I wouldn't be surprised to see this album hitting the bargain bin very soon."
2,Taking The Long Way,"I think that is a boring album,and nothing related with another great live performing of Dixie Chicks.Period!I had waste my money!"
1,Don't bother,"This album was a shocker! I was really disappointed and feel that the chicks did not live up to the quality that I had come to expect from them. It was as if they have all been off their prozac for a couple months, very depressing and angry!"
1,"Miss You, Chicks","I am a huge fan of the Chicks. Felt horrible about how they got slapped by the Country Music family. Because of that I stopped listening to CM radio. But this album is all sour grapes, and no fun at all! I threw it away - couldn't even listen to it twice. I tried! Boring, though."
2,Taking The Long Way Falls Short,"One maybe two good songs, the rest are very average - not up the Dixie Chicks usual excellence"
1,Nothing like their previous releases,"Where did their country sound go? It's nowhere to be found on this cd. We kept skipping over the songs looking for something that sounded like their usual country sound. This one needs to be placed in a different music style. If you are looking for the same old sound, look somewhere else. We were quite disappointed."
2,Taking The Long Way,Another pitiful effort by this group. I am sick and tired of country music imposters.
4,"If more country music were like this, it wouldn't be so terminally boring","Not the first and not the last to review this by starting with 'I'm not a country music fan, but...', I have to say these gals make music that is mindful, thoughtful (not the same thing), thought-provoking, and persists in the mind long after you're done playing it. Country-folk, maybe, with a dash of Dylan, Sheryl Crow, Chris Isaak, and Paul Simon in there somewhere. And harmonies in popular music haven't been this tight since Brian Wilson led the Beach Boys during the '60s (Wilson knew something about thoughtful lyrics, too, so I doubt he'd mind the comparison). Because of this, the Dixie Chicks' music often surpasses genre. This is country for people who think, as opposed to the mindless, insipid, repetitive, mediocre, occasionally irritating, and time-wasting twaddle that passes for country music these days. Enough said. Just listen."
5,Dixie Chicks...,"These girls are great! Such talent, such diversity. They deserve the Grammy's no matter what some others may think!"
3,DRAB for the most part,"I have been a big DC's fan since the git go but was disappointed with this work. I don't know if it was their politics that caused poor concert turn out, or this music, probably some of both. I ordered to show my support for them (politically) but was disappointed with the music. Not their normal beats, rhythms, or singability if you're a sing-a-long type like me."
4,Their 5-Star Album Is Still In The Future,"I have been waiting for a GREAT album by this extremely talented group ever since WIDE OPEN SPACES. This one comes the closest to being solid, yet still manages to just miss the mark because of its lack of variety and its overproduction. Most of the songs are good, though, some better than good. Yet there is nothing as engagingly humorous here as ""White Trash Wedding,"" from their last one (""Lubbuck Or Leave It"" is an amusing country song title, though). Otherwise, this is much more musically complex and interesting than HOME... and congratulations to The Chicks for the defiance of the red state insistence that one must agree with everything a Republican president says and does or one is unpatriotic (it doesn't go both ways, not surprisingly; if the president happened to be a liberal Democrat, it would be open season). So keep fighting, girls, and making fine music. Now, next time, can we hear those smiles again?"
4,Different but in a good way.,"If you like the Dixie Chicks...you will like this. Different songs with a lot of meaning behind them, a nice change of pace."
4,very offended...but entertained,"i will always love the dixie chicks. we own 3 previous cds. i have yet to purchase this one, but they sound fantastic as always. the stupid politicizing by the idiot below totally turns me off. my brother died on 9-11 and to say that ""the US deserved it"" is the most rediculous, painful and shameless thing i have ever heard. grow up and just enjoy the music."
4,I like it...,"I don't love it, but I like it alot. I do love their music in general and would buy any CD they put out. I love Natalie's voice and the other two chimming in and picking on the bango, fiddle, etc...I think it's unfair how they're being treated, but it is what it is...I like the CD..."
5,Solid effort,"The Dixie Chicks are back with a strong collection of songs. If you are a fan of their fun music like ""Goodbye Earl"", then look somewhere else, you likely won't find anything on here that compells you. The album is largely a pop/rock album, abandoning their country roots. This album feels natural to listen to, a blueprint of where the girls are now. Rick Rubin produced the album. The first single is the defiant ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" which attacks those who were against them for Natalie's comments about the Iraqi war in 2003. The whole album is solid but highlights include ""The Long Way Around"", ""Easy Silence"", ""Baby Hold On"", ""Bitter End"", ""Silent House"", ""Favorite Year"", ""Everybody Knows"", and more. Definately a solid album that asserts their identity."
5,"Another winner from the ""Chicks""","I recommend this to everyone. It's packed with really good songs and has been a long time coming. If people can manage to appreciate the Dixie Chicks for their artistry and remember that this country is based on freedom of speech, then this album should do really well."
3,MEDIOCRITY PERSONIFIED,"ONE GOOD SINGLE AND THIRTEEN NOT SO GOOD TO MAKE UP THE PACKAGE. ""AND THEY'RE ASHAMED OF BUSH???"""
3,"5 Stars for ""Not Ready to Make Nice""","I'm a rock guy, never bought a Chicks CD before. But, I can't stand Bush, and their criticisms of Bush got my attention. So, I went to their site which had ""Not Ready to Make Nice"", which is really more rock than country, and I really liked that song. Unfortunatly, the rest of the CD isn't like it, more country-ish. I'm trying to branch out and listen to other genres of music. And a few of the other songs are not too bad. But it isn't really my type."
2,Quality Dixie Chicks not there in this one!!,"After listening to the title song, ""The Long Way Around"" I pre-ordered this record. I am very dissapointed with the overall content, and lack of variety of songs on this latest Dixie Chicks release. The title song is great, and ""I Hope"" deserves an Honorable Mention. However songs 2-13 sound all the same, almost all having the same guitar cords and Natalie seems to be singing in the same key for each and every song. This album is lacking the quality banjo, violin, and other instrument solo's of the Dixie Chicks of the past. Save your money and buy the single only!!!"
5,Natalie Rocks...... and her music does too!,"Every track is incredible! I love the new sound! I bought two cd's, one for the car and one for the house. Watched the 60 Minutes interview and ordered the cd the next day. Natalie kicks....! This is my new favorite cd! I could write endless praises of just how good it is.....it is their Best.... just buy it! Thanks for the music!"
5,"""Not ready to make nice""",This cd reminds me of how the chicks can still manage to put any girl back to the country. I bought the cd today and the whole thing is amazing. I dont think it is as good as thier others however it is still worth every dollar spent. They traded thier boots for heals but they coninue to stand out with a unique sound and write lyrics that are honest and original. I dont care what she said about bush. Lots of celebrities speak out against him but few were as criticized as them. and besides everyone says something they regret and nobidy is perfect. we fight for the right for everybody to have freedom of speech. buying this cd doesn't make me anti-american. being against freedom of speech might.
3,Dixie Chicks -- Losing The Edge?,Typical Dixie Chicks -- easy to listen to but nothing outstanding in this one. I listened to it once -- now it's sitting on a shelf.
2,boring,As much as I loved HOME and FLY I disliked this CD. I was expecting at least something as lively and entertaining as their previous works. This was a snoozer. It will gather dust until I can trade for something better. The voices were there but the ballad like songs just dragged on and on.
5,Great Album,"I would have bought this anyway, but if it sticks it to the right I will buy it twice and I DID. Go DIXIE CHICKS."
2,The Wet-Noodles of Country are Trying to Become the Wet-Noodles of Pop,"I wrote a critical review of the Dixie Chicks CD a couple of days ago, and now it disappeared. I've noticed other reviewers saying the same thing, and I've read negative reviews of this Cd that disappear a few hours later. It is kind of ironic given that many of the Dixie Chicks supporters cry ""freedom of speech.""The music on this CD, which includes a lament about infertility, is pretty unexiting given all the controversy. I keep reading that the Dixie Chicks are ""brave"" but it doesn't take bravery to come out and say that you've changed your mind (again) and are now against Bush (again) when his approval ratings are as low as they are now. It would have been brave to stick to your guns back when he was more popular. The Dixie Chicks waffling is pretty pathetic."
3,OK but Some People are Giving High and Low Ratings for the Wrong Reasons,"Dont' believe the people who are giving this CD one star: It is not that bad! They are undoubtedly still angry about the Dixie Chicks statements, made to a British audience years ago, that they were ""embarassed"" about President Bush.But don't believe the people who are giving it five stars either: It is not that good! They are undoubtedly motivated by animus against the President and like what the Dixie Chicks said about him.I'm a Democrat who voted for Al Gore and John Kerry, but that doesn't mean I can't acknowledge mediocre music when I hear it. I am a bit embarassed to admit that I bought this CD based on all the pro-Dixie Chick news stories and reviews in magazines, newspapers and on TV.This CD is OK but nothing special. It is highly commercial pop (nothing ""country"" about it except the accents). You'll listen to it a few times and then put it back on the shelf and forget about it."
2,A Change in Music Style,"I really like the dixie chicks and I really like the dixie style.(I am big blue grass fan)This album seemed totally different to me, a different feel, a different style.More of a country album than a dixie album. Maybe it is naive to expect more of the same, since they have matured as artists. But I am sad none the less."
3,Sounds like America!,"This album sounds great -- I checked it out on aol.com. The sound is lush and sweet, like driving through tall trees as fall turns. I take 2 stars away beacause: 1) They say ""I"" and ""me"" a lot... while i'm not that concerned with their hardships. 2) They're not that good looking. (If Kylie Minogue sang these songs, I'd give 5 stars -- she's that shaggable!). 3) Are they glad about the goofy ""Bush/Texas"" statement, or tearful... are they following the polls? I can't figure these chicks out! # 1 and 3 are minor qualms. The biggie is simply that they're not that hot looking! Nice voices though, if you like sounds. (Here's a suggestion: When listening to this cd, imagine Kylie Minogue riding a mechanical bull! That'll take it over 4 stars)."
1,Sad,I don't write a review unless i feel stongly about it.I'd give it less than one star if I could.
2,Not for Everyone,"Listen to the music: If you think that it deserves a five star rating I've got my little sister's used ""Britney Speares"" CDs to sell ya. I guess highly commercial pop appeals to many out there (or is it their politics?), but I prefer serious music. This stuff is like a cross between Stevie Nicks and Rick Astley."
2,They should change their names from the Dixie Chicks to the Sob Sisters,"I hate to admit it, but I was swept up in the pro-Dixie chicks media hype that followed the release of this CD. I bought it after hearing only two songs and was quite disappointed. They had waited a while to release a new album and so you would have thought they would have produced a more solid effort.I would have to say that there are production problems that make much of the sound far too diffuse. And then there are the lyrics and Ms. Maine's tone of voice: All the whining is a bit hard to take from a group of extremely rich ladies. One song is even about one of the Chicks difficulties getting pregnant. They are even complaining now to the press about weak concert ticket sales in some markets, as if they have some kind of inherent right to sell out every show. Their CD is #1 in sales and they should be happy, but instead they're still whining!"
5,Lullaby is a beautiful song!,"I don't care for the Dixie Chicks politics, but I do like their music. After hearing ""Lullaby"" while watching t.v. the other night, I decided that this CD is a must have. Lullaby is absolutely beautiful and I'm sure the rest of the album will be equally good."
5,Ignoring this music over politics would be a huge mistake,"As a non-country music, college educated professional who spent 24 years in Texas, leaving in 1988 and never looking back,my thoughts are that this album has heart and talent all throughout it. Practically all the songs are very accessible to people of all musical tastes and speak to us of the adult challenges we all face-whether blue state or red state lovers. The Chicks are highly talented musicians who continue to evolve. Oh, and they are right about Lubbock. Buddy Holly was reviled by many in the Lubbock populace in the 1950's for playing what was seen as that ""black people's"" rock n roll and marrying a Hispanic. Ask his widow if you doubt me.Of course, now they celebrate him."
5,Wonderful!,"An CD with wonderfully, honest lyrics, beautiful voices, and awesome music that has my family singing along to the CD all the time. I think that if you really, truly, listen to the lyrics and the music you can't help but love this album."
5,The Best Album of the Year so Far,"Taking the Long Way is a more mature album than their previous ventures, but their heart and soul still shines through. My favorite track has to be ""Voice Inside My Head,"" a song about regret and wonderment. All the other tracks are excellent though, and it's a shame that radio will not support this. This is easily their best album with 14 of the best songs of 2006."
3,"Very good, but I have problems with it.","I bought this album for two reasons. One is that I really liked their first album, even though country is not typically what I listen to, and I especially liked their standon the Bush administration.However, problem is that there is TMI, too much information. Presumably these are songs from the heart, and a woman with a kid(s) should not be writing some of the stuff that waswritten and sung on this album.Second, the album should have been somewhat shorter. The voice isn't the prettiest one out there, and after awhile, it begins to grate."
5,"Simply Put, A Great Album","It is very different from their previous CDs--not nearly as ""country."" But probably their best. Very honest, personal lyrics and beautiful melodies. These are incredibly talented ladies."
4,Chicks mostly misfire.,"This is a stretch. The Chicks were clearly venting there feelings on this one. Most of the songs sound more pop oriented than country, even though that is the category they come under most often."
2,Not the normal Dixie Chicks,"I have a couple Dixie Chicks CD's and this one is by far the worst one. It is very dark, depressing and slow. It doesn't have their usual upbeat, almost campy feel. I was disappointed."
1,"This sucks I-man, you lied.","I got this for my wife, I had to suffer through it yesterday on the way to Red Lobster. Some of the songs had a nice mellow beat and sounded all right, but most of it sucked, the singing sounded monotone. Way to much drama to boot, save your money. Imus said this was good, he was wrong. I was disapointed.TCBRN."
1,Not so much...,"I really, really, wanted to like this. I LOVE the Chicks, always have, and totally supported them through the whole political thing. But I have to agree with the reviewers who have said that when all is said and done, the songs aren't very good. Nothing catchy or moving on here, like there usually is. Maybe it's because they used a bunch of other songwriters, or something - I don't know. I'm very disappointed."
1,Whoa,"Omigod what a lot of hype. I guess there are a lot of people around who really hate Bush, huh? I'll count myself among them, but man, there's gotta be a better way to show it than listening to this CD. My friend gave this to me for a birthday present, and I was pretty excited, given all the great things I've heard. But boy, this CD really blows. I don't know what in the world all these people are talking about, but I know one thing for sure - it can't be the music! Don't blow your cash on this - get something good."
4,Dixie Chicks Do Make Nice,"This is clearly one of the Chicks best albums to date. No matter what your politics, this is a must have."
4,Miss You Dixie Chicks,When this album first came out I bought it right away only to be stolen by a family member who loved it as much as I did. This was the 'chicks' last album and I encourage anyone who is a Dixie Chick fan or new to there music to buy this album and enjoy. I hope that soon they'll release another album.A fan Marti
2,Disappointed,"This album was disappointing, not because of the material or performances, but because of the heavy hand of producer Rick Rubin, who decided the Dixie Chicks are really a pop act. Consequently, instead of the delicate acoustic subtleties of previous albums what you get is in-your-face, overcompressed and overly-bright with an annoyingly up-front snare that bangs without variation as if it were a sequenced sample.Compare this with the classic ""Wide Open Spaces"", which is beautifully recorded and mastered and worthy of use as a reference for recording engineers. The contrast with ""Long Way"" is depressing."
4,Rockin with Integrity,"It's not only ever about love, loss and hard times with these chicks. Their lyrics are much more profound than that...they make you think while you tap your feet to great rhythms and listen to the beautiful harmonies these ladies put out. Their band is solid. We are growing up with the chicks now, as parents, responsible citizens, spouses (sure there are love songs), children. They write from the heart."
5,A PROUD Chicks Fan!,I have never been more proud to call myself a fan of anybody's music before. The are TRUE artists. They say what they believe in and they don't sell out to satisfy the rednecks. Any time you turn on country radio there is some white guy in a cowboy hat who sounds exactly the same as the guy who came on before him and they're both singing about the same exact thing. Country music is trash these days. The Dixie Chicks go against the grain. They make music they believe in and that is what makes them special. I love and respect them for basically giving all the red states the finger. The Chicks are true Americans. The people who burned their CDs aren't.
5,"Deeply, deeply moving","I became a fan when I first heard I Can Love You Better. Since that time, I've bought all of the Chicks' albums. The Home album was terrific, but Taking the Long Way is every bit as good. First, there are those voices; Natalie Maines is this compressed bundle of energy that you feel could blast through concrete with her vocal power and expressiveness. What a personality! It comes through in her singing. And those harmonies! Marti and Emily suround Natalie's power with sweetness, depth and light.I loved Not Ready to Make Nice, but the one that really blows me away is Everybody Knows. I can't stop playing it. Then you have the rocking I Like It (I do like it!) These girls could definitely be a rock band. Then there's I Hope, real gospel. And these ladies have soul. They carry it off. Not just three white chicks bowdlerizing some black artist's stuff. These ladies have chops.The instrumentation is as always of the highest quality.Recommendation: Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!"
5,Best CD I've EVER Heard,"I purchased this CD to support the Dixie Chicks' right to freedom of speech, but I am thrilled to say that it's the best purchase I've ever made. I had to force myself to listen to every song because I loved each song so much when I first heard it, that I kept playing just that song over and over. I've finally heard them all and I can't even name a favorite (today it's ""Everybody Knows"" but tomorrow it'll be something else!) Thanks (Chicks) for creating a CD that brings such pleasure to my everyday life. And thanks for not backing down and making ""nice"" -- the C&W industry wouldn't expect a MAN to do that."
5,Chicks rule!,"What a pleasure it is to listen to musicians grow artistically over time. I've loved every Chicks album, beginning with ""Dale Evans,"" but this is easily their best--outstanding songwriting and musicianship, as always, but now backed by Heartbrekaers Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench, Keb Mo', Bonnie Raitt, Sheryl Crow, John Mayer, and others. The songs are more mature and so more satisfying, and the singing is exquisite.And what an inspiration to see the Chicks stand their ground in the face of witless pseudo-patriotic jerks who serve as useful idiots in the service of creeping tyranny. Thank you Natalie, Martie and Emily for your courage and integrity."
5,Great Album (which seems to be selling well!),"I noticed the negative reviews were coming from people who didn't like the chick's personal opinions about the president. Well, be that as it may, this is a great album and a lot of people must agree because at least on Amazon it is selling well. When I purchased my copy, it was rated #20. Not bad. I guess most people don't care what was said or maybe they even agree."
5,A great album,"Whatever your feelings are for the Dixie Chicks' opinions on politics, this is a GREAT album. It is completely different from antyhing they have done. I don't think it is a complete stray from country music. The songs are bold and fresh. #6 Lullaby is an amazing track, as is #12 Hold On. The Chicks' have grown and matured and their music is proof of that. THis is a must have album. This CD was worth the wait. Welcome back Dixie Chicks! NICE JOB!"
1,not impressed,"OK, just what genre does this group fit into now? Do they still consider themselves country? adult contemporary? Pop? I just don't get the fascination with this mediocre and self described controversial and self promoting group - sorry. Don't waste your money."
2,Wake me when it's over!,"I heard this CD for the first time last week at a friend's house. My friend's wife actually played it twice. Now I am no pop-country fan and certainly no fan of the Chicks, but one song just seemed to blend into the next leaving me to wonder where the substance and maturity every other reviewer is talking about here. The fact that it received album of the year only highlights the sad state of the Grammies.I will admit to being quite surprised that very little of this CD was political, and will add one star to my review for that reason alone. The damage is done though! First Maines apologies for her ill-advised comments at a concert in England, then spends two years wining about the inevitable backlash she received for making them.Speaking of backlash, I guess I have set myself up to get some here from the legions of starry-eyed Chicks fans. Funny, it never ceases to amaze me how folks will rate a review ""not helpful"" just because they do not agree with it!"
2,Another lackluster anti-Bush album,"There are two good songs on the album, and it was better than Neil Young's pathetic attempt at an anti-Bush rant, but even at Amazon's cut-rate price, I'll take a pass, and before any of you Kool-aid drinkers flame me in your tiny little thoughts, I bought the album ""Rage against Bush"" (various artists) because it did have qulity music.Just don't tell me that the album is quality - it isn't. I'm sure every Goth anti-Bush zealot will buy it because of its politics, but this CD will be forever collecting dust 14 days after purchase."
1,What music!!!???,"Ok..not country..not rock, pick a genre please. They were better before all of the political mess. Now they are LA pop wannabes, the music is not growing but has fallen stagnate to just being a political retort soundtrack. *YAWN*"
1,Terrible and politically motivated,"Like Bon Jovi, the Dchix just cannot keep their big mouths shut and just give us great music. Loved these gals who are great musicians, just so tired of the rambling blather about subjects they really do not know anything about. Just stick with the music and let the lobbyists handle the bungling of the times. Oh sure, the voices are heard but I want the music to be music not some politically motivated rant and wail. Whining is at an all time high here and can we even wonder what they will have to talk about in 2009? I was so disappointed I threw this out the car window and watched with glee as a Kenworth drove over it and smashed it into little bits. Nat, well her voice is annoying in the first place so I would rather hear a fire alarm at close range. The songs are about as intelligent as a Ted Kennedy driving school manual. I hope the next album gets back to basics and they let Bon Jovi deal with being a poser."
3,This album is so average,"No offense to the Dixie Chicks, or to their fans, but this is just another average or ""pretty good"" album. NOBODY was talking about this album all year, and nobody was suggesting people buy it because it is ""so great."" What we have here unfortunately, is a gang of liberal Grammy voters who thought it would be exciting to try and stick it to the former fans of the Chicks in the south and mid-west (oh, and who just happen to have voted for the President twice) by wrongly awarding an un-deserved and totally un-earned Grammy award to them. Oh, what fun it was to see them onstage accepting their Grammy award...ha ha ....what redemption! Had this truly been a great album, I would gladly heap praise on it. Let's face it....only GREAT albums should win ""Album of the Year"" awards, not average ones....."
2,Don't Believe the Hype - Just Look at All the Used CD's For Sale at Amazon,"As I type this review, there are already 52 used ""Taking the Long Way"" compact discs that people are trying to unload here at Amazon. Despite claims of persecution, the Dixie Chicks and their album have been heavily promoted by the media. They've been on the covers of magazines, including TIME, and were the subject of a glowing report on ""60 Minutes."" Most of the reviews and stories about them and the album are more like infomercials than honest journalism. People are buying the CD due to the hype and are now obviously stuck with some bad music.Obviously, all those people giving glowing reviews of the CD are being motivated more by political bias than by what is really on the CD."
1,"No Passion, Uninspired, Hollow","I am a fan of the Dixie Chicks and have loved their previous work, but something about this album seems rushed. All the songs feature lyrics which never really go anywhere, it's almost as if they're being too safe. I really didn't like it. I want my money back Natalie!"
2,I tried and I tried....,"I was not thrilled when the Dixie Chicks used a public concert in a foreign country to voice their opinions- wasn't, in my opinion, the appropriate venue for it. However, I was more then willing to buy this CD because I'm a HUGE DC fan and ready to get back to being entertained. But, it wasn't worth it- they are, to me, no longer ""one of us girls singing about every day life"". It was a big sob ""oh woe is me"" album- not up to their standards. I don't feel that this CD will last the test of time, and I'm really bummed that it's turned into Natalie's band. What happened to the sisters with the amazing instrumental talent? Maybe next time...."
4,Good CD But Album or the Year?,"I have always like the Dixie Chicks and their political statements didn't change anything for me. When this CD got Album of the Year I decided I had to have it. Don't get me wrong, its GOOD...several tracts are even GREAT...but there is also some stuff I would consider ""filler"". To me, this album should have never beat James Blunt's Back to Bedlam which is GREAT from the first song to the last.But, if you like the Dixie Chicks (and I really do), you should definitely get this CD. It does include some of their best work and you will have real insight into how they felt after Natalie's statements about President Bush."
5,Excelent,"This is a gret record, and excelent piece of music.Dixie Chicks shows once agins why they are THE DIXIE CHICKS.I love all about hers."
5,Pleasant surprise,"I bought this recording as a political statement; to validate the right of the Dixie Chicks (and all of us)to express personal views, regardless of the popularity of said opinions.I was delighted to find that the songs are by turn catchy, evocative, rebellious, and consistently melodious, sing-able, offerings. Add to that the fact that the lyrics are clearly, cleanly pronounced, and I find myself playing this cd far more often than I would have guessed."
5,"Love it, Love it, Love it","SO glad the Chicks are back! They are a must see in concert! I never have been a real big fan of country music, per se, but to me, the Chicks have such a different attitude with their sound. They aren't polished and ""blinged out""; they are as real as real gets, and I can truly appreciate some realism these days. This album, as stated before, is more somber, ""grown-up"", if you will...and the only wish I would have for it is to have another spunky-crazy-country girl song on it akin to ""Earl"". The Chicks are so fun, so lively, so DIFFERENT in a world that is full of cloned music and sampled soundtracks. I still give it 5 stars, though, because their bravery and tenacity just goes to show that you can't keep a good musician (or 3) down. I have every album, and will continue to buy them as long as they crank them out."
5,LOVE THIS CD!,Every song on this CD is GREAT! I think it is their best yet! I am proud of the Chicks for standing their ground. Good for them. This is America and we are supposed to have free speech. Good luck to the Chicks. I don't listen to ANY of the country music stations that stopped playing their music. As a matter of fact with the exception of a few artist I don't listen to country anymore at all. Toby Keith makes me want to gag! If you are a chicks fan or just a fan of GOOD MUSIC then I would buy this CD!
3,Not the best - Their videos are better,"Apparently freedom of speach doesn't include the freedom to criticize the Dixie Chicks. Even fair-minded, three star reviews by persons who are just giving their honest opinion get obliterated with negative votes. Some people don't want to see even the slightest critique of anything about this album.Many of the positive reviews of this CD use language that sounds more like they just love the Dixie Chicks and that anything they put out has got to be the greatest of all time.There are a few good tracks on this CD but the rest is just ""filler."" They have switched from country-pop to pop. They still look good, so I would give a higher rating to their videos."
4,Some great songs from the Dixie Chicks,I really enjoy this CD.There are some great songs on this one. Anyone who has a small child in their family will love the lullabye. This silent house also touched my heart.
3,"Mostly magnificient, with a couple of clunkers","I didn't hear the Chicks for the first time until their political troubles drew my attention and made me hope I might like them. I listened to ""Home"" and loved it. (Note to people who want to discover the Chicks: THAT is the CD to buy!!!) The acoustic musicianship was absolutely brilliant.That said, most of this album is terrific too, including their marvelous rebuke to their political detractors. What a great song that is, as is ""Voice Inside My Head"", about a lover tossed aside too hastily a decade ago. I could go on and on with praise of other songs.HOWEVER ... set your player to skip tracks 12 and 13, which are nothing but generic, boring, rim shot rock, with far too much drumming and electric guitar drowning out the musicianship. The Chicks are just too good to have done those two songs. But they're entitled, I guess, because most of this CD is super!Buy it for the politics. Buy it for the music. They have become a magnificent group."
5,Fabulous!,"The Girls are more fabulous than ever. Dancing, singing or listening- something for everyone and your purchase will answer those who suggest they ""shut up and sing""- sort of a vote against the present administration- I bought 3 and gave 2 away."
4,Great but not awesome,"I'm a big fan and supporter of the Chicks. This long awaited album is great, but not awesome. I say this based solely on the fact that i felt that there isn't a really strong ballad on the CD in the vein of ""Cowboy Take Me Away"", ""Don't Waste Your Heart"", or ""I'll Take Care of You"". Other than that, this CD is great. My favorite is the anthem to good times ""Bitter End"" where friends are parting ways but take one last night to celebrate the memories. Welcome back DCX. See them on tour this summer at any cost!"
5,Great album overall,"Highly recommended. Some songs look like they were fillers. Nevertheless, I like the band and there is enough to warrant the CD"
5,Dixie Chicks Taking The Long Way,They sang but they didn't shut up. I am always glad to see how true artist reveal their souls .The Chicks are telling a great story by doing a great job! 5 star
2,Not a sinlge hit on the album.,"Ok, take the war out of it, take the politics out of it, take whatever baggage you have out of the equasion. I'm comparing this album to their last three releases, and it simply doesnt measure up. The songs (written by the Chicks themselves, and it shows) are kinda dull. No hooks. No toe-tapping. Hey, I remember when these girls could sing fun songs (Long Time Gone, I Can Love You Better), and beautiful songs (Cowboy Take Me Away, Landslide, Wide Open Spaces or controversial songs (Goodbye, Earl) - but you wont find any of those here. Just some sad, self-indugent lyrics.Buy a Dixie Chicks album if you're new to them, but don't buy this one."
2,disappointed,"I'm a big fan. This one is not thier best work. I loved their first three albums, this latest I have to say does not follow. seems like they're deviating a bit from what they do best. Listening to it actually brought me down. unlike their previous works"
2,A Sure Winner!,I would recommend buying this CD. I was never into the Dixie Chicks but heard a single track and decided to take a chance. I don't regret it. The combination of words & music with the haunting violin solo's make it a winning combination. Not your usual country sound; but country matured!
3,Dixie Chicks,"I bought the CD for the #1 song of the year. I have to admit I'm not a big D.C. fan. It was okay overall. A few good songs but I didn't see it as the CD of the year. If you like the group, you'll probably like the CD more than I did."
3,Nothing to Get Exited About,"The music on this compact disc is unexceptional pop, verging on bubble-gum. As usual, the Ditzy Chicks - Oops, I mean the Dixie Chicks main appeal is their looks. Their music videos were and still are always better than their music. They may not be very bright but they still look good!"
3,Was ok,"So kind of weird..the CD case was not in great condition. But it was wrapped up in the original packaging.....but there was a hole punched in the case in the top left hand corner.. not sure what that was, but all in all i was ok"
2,Don't Wave the Flag - That Would Be Dumb!,"One reviewer claims that we should celebrate July 4th by buying this CD instead of waving the Stars and Stripes. He claims that the USA is ""the focus of evil in the World."" Given that the Dixie Chicks' Natalie Maines recently denounced ""patriotism"" as ""wrong,"" I guess that if you hate your country, that would be a good idea. But the songs I've heard from this CD are just highly commercial pop-fluff with whining singing. Plus, I love my country. I guess I'll be a jingoistic yahoo and celebrate the 4th by buying a Toby Keith CD instead."
2,"Harmless, Overhyped Fluff","Considering all the media hype and fanatically positive reviews, the songs on this album turned out to be pretty unexceptional, even boring. It's the kind of music that will soon be forgotten - but then I don't think the Dixie Chicks are about music anymore. Politically correct types will buy anything they put out and, judging by all the crazed five-star reviews, may even convince themselves that the music is something better than what it is."
5,They did it again with Taking The long way.,"I just bought Taking The long way and I must say it is Great. The more I listen to it the more I love it. It's a wonderful blend of country music with a touch of rock. I have always loved and ejoyed the Dixie Chicks and this CD just leaves me to say, They did it again. Another great CD from the Dixie Chicks. :)"
5,nothing better,"really good. all songs are real,personal and musical. if you like girl groups with substance there really is nothing better out there .great singing and musicianship."
5,The Dixie Chicks have struck again!,I just love this group -- all three girls have grown up some but their melodies and harmonies are just as lovely as ever. Sorry to hear that they're going to stop performing.
5,Thank goodness they're BACK!!,"An absolutely superb album - very, very honest, extremely well-written lyrics and excellent music ... a little country, some ballads, some very excellent rock. Stories of mostly recent and some past experiences, very real. Easy to listen to, but better if you pay close attention.For those of us who have been waiting for this ... it exceeds all possible expectations - by far their best album to date, but, more importantly, one of the best albums of all time from anyone. Will be hard if not impossible to top, but they don't need to ... just enjoy.PS: Many of us in Texas could have said exactly the same thing, verbatim, he is an embarrassment, nothing's changed, with a 29% approval rating, it's just apparent to more people now."
5,I have tears and I'm only on track three,"I couldn't wait until morning to hear this album, so I downloaded it on itunes and am crying at the beauty of just the first three songs. Every one of the chicks' albums is so unique and special, marking another chapter of their talented, strong and vibrant lives. The crystaline voice that God has gifted unto them is not wasted and on this new album it is almost at its most distinct and powerful. Their words are so poignant and on fire because they've been turned on by the challenge the world has given them. In spite of their amassed fan base and wealth, they were dejected for simply giving forth an opinion. In the greatest nation in the world, what is more sacred then the beliefs and views we are all free to have? In this well-crafted new disc Natalie really shines and tells us that she's not ready to back away from who she is, and I for one am so appreciative of the musical results of the Chicks just being themselves."
4,4 and a half stars!,"When I bought the CD, I had already heard ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" and ""Lullaby."" ""Lullaby"" is just a sweet song with a ""feel good"" 60's vibe. The title track has that same vibe. ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" is a powerful song that just builds upon itself and the strings are amazing. I loved the Celtic-influenced ""Bitter End"" and the gospel-influenced ""I Hope."" What a fitting last track! If I had been expecting a country album, I might have been disappointed. This CD just proves that the Chicks don't need to limit themselves to one genre."
5,Taking the long way,"What a great project for Chicks fans!! Hey, it's good to know these gals just keep growing stronger with each new musical adventure !And to Reba McIntyre, maybe it's you 'who's learned to sing with your foot in your mouth' cause Natalie has learned the art of singing with her tongue in her cheek without looking dumb!Keep going Chicks!Fox Watson"
3,Support the Chicks,"To tell you the truth, I bought this just to give the Chicks a pat on the back for not backing down for voicing an opinion. Turns out, it's a pretty good album!Wishing them the best of luck as they find a new fan base."
4,One of their better CD's,"Liked the songs, these girls are good. Just wish people would forgive them."
5,Worth 10 bucks and more....,"Forget about the politics. If you're into good music, this is definitely one album you should buy. I'm not into most country music, but this one is more rock than country."
4,First time for Chicks,"Well, this is my first purchase of a CD by the Dixie Chicks and quite frankly I love it! I play this on the way to work sometimes and it just gets my blood going.. great to rock to.. love the harmony.. I can pick any one I want to sing with that day! ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" is one of my favorites...definately a good addition to any collection..."
2,I have no problem with their politics but the music doesn't make it,"I have to admit that I was not a Dixie Chicks fan before and don't like country music. I bought this CD because it was compared to Tom Petty and other rockers and got tons of good reviews. But, while their new music isn't country, it isn't rock either.I don't know what to call it other than using some of the words I've seen other reviewers use, like ""commercial"" and ""overproduced."" It is pop of the kind that appeals to females.I can't help but think of Britanny Spears when I hear this stuff!"
1,Still not a Chicks fan,"I'm not a fan of the Dixie Chicks, never was. I really don't like the watered down, Cookie Cutter, Pop Country stuff. However, I'm a big Rick Rubin fan so I decided to check this album out. I love the work Rubin did with Johnny Cash..... and the Chili Peppers new album is great......and The Cult, Electric album is one of the greatest albums of all time.....and The Beastie Boys.....yeah!!! Rick Rubin can do no wrong.......well almost no wrong, I guess.If you are a DC fan you'll probably like this album, but to me it sounds like Sherly Crow.... if Crow couldn't write songs and had no talent.If you want rootsy, genuine, heart felt Country get Barricades & Brickwalls by Kasey Chambers. BTW The Chicks have always said Kasey Chambers is a big influence on them. The difference is Chambers has it in her soul and the Chicks have to try to be good....and it just ain't working."
1,Not Willing - To Forgive or Forget,"Little ""Clueless"" Natalie wants to go Hollywood. Little Natalie was never really Country anyway, even if the other two spoiled brats were. She's not willing to make nice. Well, that's Ms. Maines' or Mrs. Pashdar's prerogative, but it is also ours to tell the little girl and her Dipsy Clucks bye-bye too.C'mon Nashville. Enough of the Maines, the Clucks, the Urbans, the Chesneys, the Crows and the Flats. Give us more Paisleys, more Evans - and musicians steeped in the tradition of Owens and Cash. Not some little girls sans brains and sans talent.Just read that Dipsy Cluck ticket sales for the summer shows have nose-dived into the dungheap they created. Gee, I wonder why? Maybe Natalie or some of her Neo-Fat friends can tell us all why. Then again, maybe not."
1,Would not buy their album,"It doesn't matter how anyone rates this album..I used to love their music and I liked their spunkyness. Now, no way..Natalie has pushed the limits of respect of this wonderful place-America. There is a way of voicing your opinion without being mean and downright ""in your face"". She should eat a little humble pie."
1,worst ever,"they are now more into politics than music and they have no one to blame but themselves. their music has suffered for it.there best music is behind them.now, if you want something good , might i recommend alison krauss. she has talent and no axe to grind."
4,Not their best,Too much political influence in this album.Need more uplifting songs from entertainers.
2,Pretty voices,"An okay cd. They do have pretty voices. I just don't hear anything special on this cd. Sadly, Chicks fans are giving it 5 stars out of loyalty. They cheapen Sgt.Pepper and other classics when they vote this way. Please review this cd and if you give it 5 stars explain in your comments that you are merely a blind fan. Politics..the Chicks can say anything they want. I also hope Tim Russert records a cd of songs."
1,TRIED TO SELL IT AT A YARD SELL BUT COULDN'T GIVE IT AWAY!,I WAS GIVEN THIS FOR MY BIRTHDAY. IT IS THE WORST BIRTHDAY GIFT AN AMERICAN CAN POSSIBLY RECEIVE. I COULDN'T GIVE IT AWAY.
2,"Louder, I can't hear you.....","A triumph for loud instrumentation as a proxy for content and meaning. What we loved about the DCs was their voices and the fun they brought to their music this album has very little of the former and none of the latter. Advice to the DCs ""Turn loose the pseudo anger and get back to your roots and the fun."" Skip this album."
1,no thanks,"I received one of the CDs alexlee purchased to give away as gifts. The music was awful, the Chicks are traitors, and their fans are traitors, so all things considered, I burned it. Thanks, alex."
1,Buy it and move to Canada!,If you don't like living here & enjoy verbally tearing down your country as this trio does please buy this trash and move to Canada.
1,"Get over yourself, Chicks.","I don't care if you are conservative or liberal, music is not where I want to hear about politics. All it does it make you sound pretentious. Go back to your sound that was fun and appealing. This is drab and depressing."
1,so far from their beginnings,"what made them great were their lyrics and beautiful sound together. now they've just gone and made fools of themselves and decided to write songs to defend themselves and make them seem like they are victims. if you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen, girls! this album lacks EVERYTHING that made them famous. i think the lack of support at concerts, ie cancelations, and lack of air play on country stations says it all. we all know the only reason they got ANY awards or air play on contemporary stations is because of their politics, which they are NOT in the business of. say what you will, but you know the truth whether you admit it or not. i would dare say that 90% of the people who bought the album don't even listen to it. and now they've made a DVD too?!?! are you kidding me? talk about trying to milk an old cow to death. like their biggest supporting group's name, MOVE ON, chicks!"
1,Absolute Drivel,"This is a bad album. Someone answer me this simple question: I don't like Bush either and thought it was amusing when the Dixie whatevers put him down, but when a group calls their own fans stupid and they still buy the music? I guess they proved their point with all the raving reviews here."
1,A Slap in the Face,"The grammy award given to the Dixie Chicks for this album is a clear slap in the face meant to belittle our President of the United States and Commander and Chief when we are at a time of war. Whether you believe in the cause or not, we have men and women making sacrifices for this country and betraying them with this sanctimonious award to the Dixie Chicks is typical of the ""Hate Our Country Left"". I've been listening to country radio for a long time with alot different stations and I've never even heard one of these songs being played in my area of Texas. These are talented ladies who should be recognized for their art and not for their hate."
