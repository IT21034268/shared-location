1,Awful guitar,"I bought this guitar for my nephew for Christmas and I was SO excited to give it to him. He opened it up and immediately began playing it and 2 strings broke. We fixed the strings and they broke again. He was dying to wear the strap so we tried to put the strap on but there was no where to attach it. Big disappointment. The sound is horrible, even to his young, untrained, inexperienced ears. He was beyond disappointed and frustrated. I took it back home w/ me and immediately returned it and am looking for another."
1,Not what we were hoping for,My 4 year old grandson received this as a gift in his village in Alaska. He was not happy with it.
2,Broken,"The guitar was broken when we opened the box Christmas morning. I don't know what it is called, but the the thing that holds the strings opposite from where you tune it was broken. My son was really disappointed, hopefully they will take it back. It looked like an okay guitar and the case, strap, picks, etc. were a nice addition. I'm guessing this was just a defective one or possibly jostled too much during holiday shipping."
1,toy guitar,"This guitar looks nice and the accessories are nice, but it is a toy as I was unable to tune it. Returned with no problem."
1,Terribly Made,"UPDATE 1/28/13- Sent in complaint about string and asked for replacement strings. Seller was awesome enough to send me another guitar...except this time the strings were just as bad and the color was completely different than the first one. I took to a guitar shop here in my town to see if they could tighten but was told it was cheap and to just throw away. seller tried to make it right the product is just a bad product:Original post: The strings were not tight and there is no way to get them tight. It sounded horrible, looked worse and the color is nothing like the picture. But cannot complain for the price."
2,You get what you pay for,"This guitar was cheap, and it seems cheap. My daughter has been taught to be careful with it, like with any instrument, so she hasn't managed to break it like some others commented. I did have to restring one string upon arrival. It is fine, but nothing more than that."
1,Don't bother,"OK, so it's a kid's guitar. I did, however, expect it to last longer than a day. Strings constantly came loose. Even the most elementary tuning was not possible. Big waste of money."
5,"As Advertised, Work Perfectly","These `memory sticks pro' are exactly as advertised. My older Sony VAIO PCV-RX850 would not initially recognize them so I visited Sony.com and downloaded a driver for the item. They work perfectly, as advertised"
3,Not a Thriller,"This flop by Karin Fossum really surprised me! Don't Look Back, the first of her books to be published in English, was engaging and well written. He Who Fears the Wolf is a strange circus of bizarre characters who hide out in a cabin deep in a forest. Two of the three are wanted for crimes committed early in the novel.However, there's no detecting, no police procedures, no nothing! Chief Inspector Sejer is almost absent from the story, and I found this novel to be quite dissatisfying. I hope Calling Out For You does better."
3,A little bit too much like Nicci French,"Errki Johrma is crazy, very crazy: he hears voices, is practically unreachable for normal people and bites when he feels threatened. When he escapes from the psychiatric ward where he is staying and is seen near a farm where an elderly lady is murdered, it is easy to draw the conclusion that he is the murderer. But it is very difficult to track him down: a bank robber has taken him hostage and hides with him in the woods. Somehow Erkki and the bank robber get attached to each other until a freak accident happens...People around me really loved this book, but to me it was a little bit too much like Nicci French: the emphasis on the literary side and not enough suspense."
1,not for me....,I was diappointed in this ...too much mumbo jumbo about mental illness...not enough concentration on the inspector...and the ending was terrible....
3,Good mystery story,"Dr VFirst, I'm not a fan of mystery books so naturally my view will be slanted more negatively. It is a book well written and suspenseful. For me, it was the subject matter that didn't appeal to me. Books about mental disorders are simply not my cup of tea. Personally, I enjoy topics that are more uplifting and books where the protagonist succeeds in the end--more along the happy ending kind of book."
2,Where was Sejer?,This was not an Inspector Sejer mystery. What I mean is too little time spent on trying to capture the suspect. Too much time devoted on the bad guys. Very repetitive. Interesting Sejer's attraction to the psychologist but what happened with that. The next of Karen's books didn't pick up on that. Boring and rather repulsive.
2,Hwere's Sejer in this book?,"I read Don't Look Back by Karin Fossum. It was an average story that has been written many times. The saving grace to that book was the main character, Inspector Sejer. He is interesting and really the only reason, in my mind, to read Karin Fossum books.He Who Fears the Wolf is not about Inspector Sejer solving a killing through great detective work. It is really a paranormal story that is uninteresting. The killer is found by a forest service employee finding the trail. Sure there is a bit of Sherlock Holmes in deducing the actual killer but the reader should have already figured that out by then. I was so disappointed that I will not read any more Karin Fossum books."
5,Insights into a different culture -,"This is the first book I have read in the series which was recommended by a friend. I was very impressed with the plot and expecially with the dialoge. Ms. Fossum was able to provide some insight into the ways Norway views its mentally ill citizens and some of its views of ""at-risk"" youth. I was pleased to find that both populations seem to have available treatment that appears to be appropriate and humane. I am looking forward to reading more!"
4,He Who Fears the Wolf,I very intellectual and full of suspense mystery. I've become a big fan of the Inspector Sejer mysteries and looking forward to ordering more from Amazon. I've become a big fan of the Nordic mystery writers.
4,Nordic noir rides again,"Scandinavian writers know how to write moody, disturbing thrillers. This is my first read of a Karin Fossum book but it will not be my last. Not as good as either Stig or Jo or Henning but still guaranteed to make the hair on the back of your neck rise."
4,This is a rarity.,This came with my infernal affairs boxed set dvd. It tells the whole Infernal Affairs story in chronological order. It is specially edited so that the three films are seamlessly inetegrated into one long film. Buy it if you are a big fan of the series. This dvd is very hard to find.
3,The Departed,"When first watching this film, I was blown away with the plot and acting. Then the 2nd and 3rd movie followed up the next year and expectation wasn't disappointed. It's like a Hong Kong ""The Godfather"" trilogy with cops. I hope the American remake does not disappoint its viewers much like that garbage film ""Gangs of New York"" staring Leonardo DiCraprio. Great trilogy, great DVD, great deal. Plus you can't find this disc set anywhere. I looked. The only problem with this set is that it plays in the chronological order of the trilogy. Weird, but interesting!"
5,Waverley Pictorial Dictionary,"I have owned a mint condition set of these beautiful old books for over thirty years. Loads of illustrations, both photographic and drawings. Also some fine old colour plates. I have spent many a happy hour just browsing through them. They were originally designed for children, but I would think these would appeal more to adults than today's children."
4,Fair,"This dogbone lock is very nice and well buildt. It is perfect for use on any car or truck if you are going to remove it after each use. But it is not for use on a motorhome reciver, were it is going to be left on for some time.The problem is ! The protective rubber cap that covers the key entry, fits loosely. The cap will not stay on to protect the key entry slot. Any little bump in the road, and off it comes ! Dirt and water gets into the lock mechanism, the key will not go in and you will not get it off with out a cutting torch."
3,Shaft not long enough,"Looks like a nice quality lock, but it is not long enough for many of the newer receivers. No specs provided on the shaft length to enable buyers to determine till it arrives. e.g. it is not long enough for Tundra and some Ford receivers. The outside width of the receiver is 2-7/8"" to 3"". Tri Max makes an SXT5 which is 1/2"" longer and will fit."
2,Shaft Not Long Enough; seems sturdy though.,"Looks like a nice, sturdy product, but the shaft isn't long enough to fit through the receiver hitch on my 2009 Tacoma. Need to return it now."
2,"Shaft too short, O-ring doesnt fit",I just wanted to say I can back up what others are saying about these MasterLock Receiver Locks. The shaft was too short for my 2011 Tacoma's receiver and I did notice the O-ring didn't fit properly and stuck out the side of the lock when the lock was pushed on the end and locked. I'm returning mine.
5,Roger,Great lock for rear carrier or trailer. This one is easy to use and really secure. Don't waste your time with other. Buy this one FIRST!!
3,MASTER HITCH LOCK,"Product seems to be ok, but it won't stay on the hitch since it looks like the rubber cover won't hold up and will allow dirt to get in and jam the lock. Biggest problem with this item was Amazon's choice of a shipping company that couldn't find the house. Amazon should stick with known shippers, or give the purchaser a choice of the shipping company when the purchaser is paying for shipping. Disappointed with Amazon on this one."
1,Didn't fit my Toyota Tacoma,"I was expecting a real quality lock and it may be, but it didn't fit my 2005 Toyota Tacoma! It looks like ""Master"" is a ""minor"" on this one, either scamming people to buy them or not thinking things out in a logical or helpful way. Also, I was so sure it would fit that I threw away all the packaging and now I can't even return it!"
2,receiver hitch lock failure,"This lock worked ok when it was first installed, but after only one year on my truck the lock mechanism itself froze up so badly that it could not be opened even by a locksmith. The rubber cover had been in place the entire time. It cost me more to have the lock drilled out than the lock itself cost me in the first place."
5,Excellent Quality,Simple and easy to use. Heavy duty. Should deter anyone from trying to remove it. Need seven more words to post this review.
2,Didn't hold up very well.,"I am using this on a Curt receiver and the length is perfect. It appears to be of high quality construction (with a bit if weight to it) and this design prevents any rattling on bumpy roads. My only complaint is that it gets rust buildup inside the lock mechanism after a few months, so you need to clean it periodically.Update:A great deal of dirt has found its way into the lock mechanism so I guess the fit is not secure like it should be. Also it is now rusting which I find a bit odd in all stainless construction. I see the head design has changed based on the new picture here so maybe the issue is fixed now."
1,Busted after one season...,"I used this in a hitch step for the winter, mainly as a second bumper. When I went to take it off, which zero torq on it, the key broke off in the lock. There's no way to get it out. This was only like the 3rd time I'd used the key."
3,It works but...,...the key working at a right angle to the shaft makes it kind of a pain in the butt since there isn't a lot of room to work with there (especially when putting my flag hitch cover on). (Both of my other receiver locks the key inserts in the end - works better for me.) I'm also not fond of having to have the key turned to slide the lock mechanism onto the shaft - I don't get a good feel about if it's locked correctly or not without tugging on it for a few seconds. I wouldn't buy another one.
2,poor design,"After reading many of the reviews on this item, I decided to still give it a try anyway. I purchased a new O ring and replaceed it. I sprayed the lock mechanism with silicone spray so the key would work smoothly. The rod did not snap easily onto the lock. I had to turn the key while trying to insert the rod. Having a third hand would have helped. After finally getting everything in place, the rubber protective cap strap broke the very first time. I took the rubber housing off and threw it away. I'll just have to see how long it lasts before the lock mechanism freezes up."
4,so far so good,so far so good. this lock is very easy to use when either simply locking it or when you remove the pin and ball hitch altogether.
5,Masterlock Hitch Lock,I am very pleased with the receiver lock. It is very sturdy and I am sure willm give years of service. I definitely would recommend it.
1,Very difficult locking mechanism,I have had this lock for close to a year now. The handful of times that I have tried to open the lock have been so difficult that I am now going to discard it. The lousy O-Ring has slipped off almost every time I use the lock and has now torn in half. Never had such a hard time using a lock.
1,too short!,lock it too short to fit the receiver on my tacoma. Looks like a decent lock but I am dissapointed that I will have to buy a different one now.
1,Lock Doesn't Fit As Advertised,"Lock shaft is 1/8 inch short of fitting the receiver on my 2010 Tacoma. Thought it was the rubber casing preventing the shaft from passing through the receiver with enough room on the end for the lock, so I cut off the casing. All that did was make it so I couldn't return the lock. Hate it when products are not as advertised."
2,The issue with the rubber ring still exists!,"I purchased this lock thinking that if a defect was clearly presented and documented the issue would be addressed by the company. I was incorrect in thinking that, Master Lock should consider getting some of their quality control personal to read some of the product reviews on Amazon.This product works well but the defect with the rubber ring still exists. I suspect that if you were to leave this lock on year round with the rubber ring not seated correctly it would almost certainly destroy the lock.I gave this item two stars because the defect was not addressed; I did not purchase this item with the intention to repair it. I will try and find an appropriate size rubber ring at the hardware store that would better suit the lock.Other than the above mentioned issue the lock has performed flawlessly. It fits well, looks great, and the level of security is outstanding."
1,product good but wasn't aware it would not fit the rack,"The rating is no fault of the product. The product looks great but I wasn't made aware that it did not fit the Swagman bike rack I bought at the same time. The Swagman has a threaded hitch pin. I could not send it back because I would have to pay to send it back and also because of 3% foreign exchange(Cdn) on my card, so still have it. That is why the one star. So make sure it fits the product you are purchasing it for...and Amazon could maybe note that it doesn't fit the Swagman and not suggest it."
5,Works great for me.,"Bought for my 601021 Lund Hitch Truck bed extender. Good quality, It works as intended, my wife struggles with it for some reason. I keep it in the glove box when not using it."
5,hitch lock,The hitch lock was perfect to retain the the hitch cover a must have when you order the hitch cover!!!
2,broken key,"The product is great, however the key broke off in the lock and I had to order a whole new one."
1,Mater Lock Receiver Hitch Lock,This lock is not long enough to fit a thick 2 inch receiver hitch which was going to be used for a 2 inch Toyota PU hitch. The shank on the lock itself comes up short so you can't get the locking end to lock. It's a nice unit but will need to be used on the smaller receiver hitches less than 2 inches.
2,Not as Advertised,"My wife had ordered this for our 4 year old daughter, because we have other sets of flash cards that are similar, and my daughter loves them. Unfortunately when it arrived, we were very dissappointed to find out the product was not ""Brand New"" as advertised, but was heavily used. We first noticed that the sides of the cards were yellowed, but we weren't sure it they were just old, but when we opened up the cards we actually found some with writing on them in red ink. Although the product arrived when expected, it certainly wasn't as expected."
4,tight Bumping Jam!!!,another Knock Out Dance Hall vibe Jam from Da Kang of Modern R&B R.Kelly.R.Brought the pain again on this jam.R. got the Music Game on Lock.this was a tight Summer Jam.
1,"glib, boring","This book should be subtitled ""I was there, and it's not my fault"". The author devotes a lot of space cataloging excruciating details surrounding the failures of companies for which he worked, and not much space to analyzing the failures. The style wears thin quickly. I slogged through to the end hoping for some gem to redeem my purchase, but I was left with an interview with Joel of Joel on Software. It was on the strength of his review that I bought the book; Joel needs to stick to shilling his software."
5,ROI,"One of the most enjoyable books I have read regarding the business of high tech. Reading some of the previous reviews, I guess not everyone agrees. I personally loved the author's sense of humour, which makes for a very enjoyable read. Those who criticize the lack of 'dot.com' material, or doubt that 20 years old events are today irrelevant, miss an important point: those who forget -or ignore- history are condemned to repeat it.Besides, learning from mistakes through some other poor guy's skin has some of the better ROI I know. And told with such a witty irreverent sense of humour is just plain fun. I would warmly recommend this book. Excellent read."
5,Worth every penny,Excellent narrative of the biggest marketing blunders in the software world. Simply a must-read for every techie (or even a marketing MBA for that matter) who dreams to market a product one day. An equally important thing is that the book is extremely entertaining to read. Laughter is guaranteed.
5,Marketing matters!,"Since the beginning of the computing industry, technology companies have wondered about the value of marketing. This book explains the winners and losers in the context of marketing disasters. Rather than search for excellence, Chapman searches for explanations of how once high-flying companies fail. Positioning mistakes abound, as do mistakes resulting from executive and engineering arrogance. Using a combination of personal anecdotes and astute industry observation, Chapman proves he has been there. He shows us marketing and operational mistakes for companies like IBM, Apple, Lotus, and Novell, as well as almost forgotten MicroPro, Ashton-Tate, and Borland. Chapman has a clever and funny style, making the book very readable."
1,The Buyer is the Stupid one,"This book is another recap of all the stories you have heard for years about the personal computer world. The authors style is very amateur as is the overall packaging (graphics look like they were done in the 1980's). There is no original material in this book except for the footnotes in which the author tells you he worked at a large NY department store at Christmas one year or he owned a CPM machine which he tried to sell at a boot sale for $50.00. Really, don't buy this as you will end up feeling as stupid as I do for paying for this. It is not a marketing book--its the history of the PC business told once again."
1,There is a fundamental problem with this book...,"The fundamental problem with this book is that the author only writes about dead companies where he used to work. That's fine, but hardly objective or very informative. A particularly annoying trick he uses is to propose ""obvious"" alternative marketing choices to what the company actually did. Okay, so either this guy is the king of hindsight and monday-morning-quarterbacking, or else he had these ideas at the time and could get no one to listen to him. I suspect it's the former, as many of his ""obvious ideas"" sound like the result of years of thinking about what went wrong. If only we could pause at every decision and take a few years to see what happens, then go back and make the decision.This book is weak because it only covers the companies where the author worked. That's why there is minutely detailed coverage of MicroPro, but almost nothing about the dot-coms. Hey, I like telling my work stories too, but I'm not sure it's worth a whole book..."
3,Nice stroll down memory lane,"As the subtitle suggests, it's a book on ""Marketing"" disasters in high-tech. It offers a lot of personal insight on where many of the top software companies took the wrong turn in the forked road and resulting in being swallowed up by other companies or just simply ran out of business.I felt the Internet chapter was a bit weak. The author could have gone a bit more in depth, but that could be a book all by itself.It's a good and fast read. You will gain some insight on how not to make certain decisions, but there isn't a lot of ""lessons learned"" advice."
1,Not worth your money,"This book provides some nice stories of the 80s tech companies, but isn't really analytical in any ways. I bought the book because it has been recommended by Joel Spolsky, but later found that the book contained an interview of him. Aside from telling the stories, the author doesn't provide much analisis.Anyway, I read that book thinking ""It'll get better..."" but it never did. The last few chapters look like he rushed to finished the book! By the end, the one think I was certain of is that Chapman now gets on my nerves (his writing style is very annoying!)."
5,Informative and Fun,Product Management is the most misunderstood and abused role in technology companies. Chapman's book is healthy reading for all product managers in order to make us feel sane and give us a good springboard for future ideas.
4,Increasing Speed:Troubleshooting tips and drills for increasing pitching velocity,This product was very useful. Helped my 12 year old with some great tips to get the softball over the plate a lot quicker. She hardly walks anyone now.
5,Useful & Thought-Provoking,I thought both his philosophy of teaching and his technique to be useful and thought-provoking.
1,This book is awful!,"I was assigned to read this book for an education course this summer. The title would suggest that this book would be very useful for new and inexperienced teachers. I was extremely disappointed. Jesness rarely, if ever, explains the research behind his opinions in this book. [...]. He makes huge generalizations and gives an erroneous lesson plan trying to use the SIOP model. The worst moment in the book is where he says that ESL teachers would be justified to just teach English to English Language Learners and not teach the content areas, despite the fact that all ELLs are required to take content area exams under NCLB. There is so much rich literature to help teachers instruct ELLs, but this book is neither rich nor useful. I would highly recommend NOT reading this book."
2,of limited use for parents,"I bought this book hoping to find some specific exercises I could practice with my child in our pool. It was not very useful for that purpose. The book seems more of a way for existing swimming teachers to learn about this organization's philosophies on child development as it pertains to aquatics. It was nice to read a detailed accounting of why a 1-year-old resists back-floating but I wanted more of an idea of how to teach my child to blow bubbles and other beginning skills. It really doesn't go into actually showing you how to teach skills. This is a pitfall of buying a book based only on the title. Were I able to flip through it first, I would've realized this was probably not the book I was looking for."
3,Good for new swimming teachers,"This book is a very thorough introduction to teaching swimming to young children and is great for new swimming instructors. It covers the basics how a child's developmental stage intersects with the kinds of swimming skills and water safety children are ready to take on. However, I found it does not provide teachers with concrete ways to actually operationalize these skills through water play and songs. A few pages at the end of the book list out sample lesson plans, but if you aren't familiar with the songs listed you are out of luck (many of them appear to be australian children's songs). To be ready to teach a class you would also need to find a book of water songs and games for kids of different developmental stages."
2,We were just on different planets,"I was expecting something that allows you to go through practical exercises from infants to toddlers to do but there was what seems like endless articles on safety (which is not a bad thing), psychology etc but it just wasn't what I was expecting, the other book by Austswim was much better.."
5,love this show!,cannot get enough of this show and had to purchase the disc so i can watch more! show is a must see!
5,Best Show on TV,"Funny, entertaining. If you are a Denis Leary fan you will LOVE IT, if you are not, watch this show and you will turn into one. Great actors, great story, great show!"
5,Great DVDs,The second season was so much better than the first. I can't wait until the third season starts!
5,RESCUE Me The Second Season,"Again top notch acting,writting,story line,A++++++all the way through including the sad/shocking ending!!!Can not wait for the third season!!!!!"
1,mislead information,"Unhappy about purchase, item was listed as new, item came in 4 cases and was originally a blockbuster rental dvd. While the dvds where in good condition the item wasn't what was explained upon purchasing. After all that they all worked fine but I'm still not happy about being mislead on the purchase, I wouldn't reccomend buying from this seller again."
1,Rescue Me - The Complete Second Season,"I was really looking forward to watch these series, but after few first episodes in the first season I lost interest, its too strange for me, and I am somehow dissappointed in the quality of the pictures and they don't have subtitles not even closed captions.... :(I understand english, but I miss subtitle/closed caption option."
5,Stroke Rehab book review,"I originally borrowed this book from a college professor and ultimately purchased my own copy during an inpatient rehab rotation. I utilized many books in preparation for a stroke presentation, and found it to be the most comprehensive and useful tool for both my presentaion as well as my rotation. In my opinion, those therapists searching for an all inclusive, function based resource for stroke rehab would be very well served by this book. It has served me well, and has not left my side since I purchased it!"
3,Not as good as...,"This book was much harder for me to get into and enjoy, though I loved his 'Surprise Me' book."
4,"Not as durable as they used to be, but still a good product","This is my dogs favorite toy, but the ones in recent years have been unraveling much quicker than her original ones. As such, we have to purchase a few of these a year--but its a great size and has a great squeaker."
3,it's ok,it's just ok. my shiba inu doesn't like this treat any more than he likes his kibble (which isn't much). he loves raw meat so i'm guessing this treat isn't meaty enough.
5,"I Call These ""Doggie Crack""","My sometimes-finicky terrier LOOOOVES these treats. Of every grain-free treat I have tried, she has never, ever snubbed these. These are great for training!"
4,Tougher than Salmon treats,This package of treats with Chicken and Lamb is tougher than the soft salmon kind. My dog loves them and is sitting and doing tricks as soon as we pick up the package. Arrived on time and fresh.
5,Healthy treats recommended by Vets. Great price.,"The Vet recommended these because they are really natural and healthy treats for your dog. Give one of the best treats. It is moist and juicy and smells good that even I want to try it, too!. But use sparingly because they do run out fast and so is your cash!but I come to amazon because I know I can save $2-3 compare to those retail stores.my 10 pound Shih Tzu gets a treat every day after she takes an evening walk. A bag last about 1 month for my dog."
4,My dog liked them,My dog seems to like these treats alot. She is small so I often break them in half. She has a sensitive stomach so I am glad these work for her.
5,GREAT BOOK. I LAUGHED FOR HOURS.,I couldn't wait for this book to get here and for good reason. I laughed chapter after chapter. Being a bear myself I could really relate.
2,not very good,"Wow, too many people have rated this highly and there is sooo much better out there! Save your money and get ""Edly's Music Theory for Practical People"". It's a great read and really put the pieces together for me."
4,Good practical Knowledge,"I bought this for my daughter who is taking violin lessons but I learned she couldn't ""jam"" or improvise. I realized that she barley had any knowledge of music theory even though she is quite a good violinist. This simple book was very helpful in teaching her basic chord structure and why some scales work in certain styles of music. I found this book to be a very good introduction to music theory."
4,Great book!,"This book helped me understand music theory, thereby improving my music playing and appreciation. The factor that I enjoyed the most about this book is how it can appeal to beginners as well as advanced musicians. He explains everything very clearly. I enjoyed reading this book."
4,Basic Theory well put,"This is a rather simple presentation that is most accurate and good for the student to learn as an accompaniament to the basics when learning Guitar, keyboard or any other instrament."
1,Music Theory Made Confusing,Very confusing book with cutesy aside comments by the author. I give it zero stars. Don't waste your $$.
5,READING LEVEL AGES 7-9.,This is an illustrated chapter book for ages 7-9 (Grades 2-4). My daughter is a Jasmine fan & loved it. Book covers story in Disney's 2004 collection edition DVD.
1,Blank disc!,"I bought this DVD from 2 sources, Amazon and a shop in Banff. Both were blank! Nothing on it. Amazon refunded my money; I couldn't go back to Banff to return the first one.I would not try another one from this company."
2,Slasher,Not worth the money. Too much talking and filler added to what could have been a 30 minute movie dragged out over 90 minutes
4,Great docu- But It Hurt to Watch.,"Wow. After the years I've been in the business, going from sales person to closer, to desk manager to gsm to owner of my own dealership, I still have the turns in my stomach. If you're in the business you know what I mean. I watched this movie and felt them, the stress of not knowing if ""enough cars will be sold"" and the drive this man has, his face and heart strained with time and self torture. I encourage EVERY car sales professional to watch this movie. Also, read the Ziegler books ""Cars and People: Pissing at 60 miles an hour"" and ""Cars and People: How To Put the Two Together."""
5,Funny and Intriguing Documentary,"This documentary shows how poor people are the ones that get ripped off the most by used car salesman.The ""slasher"" is fun to watch in action. I highly recommend it."
4,Luvin_DeMode,"When you go car shopping, you automatically know it is going to be a very long process. As a society that takes our cars as a status symbol, we should also be aware of the tactics that are used to get us to buy a car beyond our means. Additionally, I came to realize that Michael Bennet must have ADHD. He could not stop talking or moving. Also, people with ADHD usually self-medicate. He drinks pretty non-stop and is a chain smoker. I have boys who have been diagnosed with ADHD, and this movie gave me a glimpse into an adult with this disorder! There really should be a follow-up documentary on Michael Bennet/"
2,Young-Adult Section??,"This period-peice unravels itself as though it were a screenplay, having had all of its plot/character development guts ripped out due to time contstraints. It successfully plods along with enough verve and wit to make this an easy-read, but nothing grabs you, there's nobody with whom to empathize.A love story 'written in the stars' means soo little when there's nothing to explain their call to action.. In the end, Gilling's tale comes off with about as much potency as the strip-mall prophetics of a guy in a Sasquache costume, holding a sign proclaiming ""Monster Deals on Sealy, Simmons, and Tempur-Pedic.""Now a story of Tobias Smith's (balloonist) tragic fall into social pariah status would have been interesting!DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME (unless between the ages of 13-18)"
4,Well Done,"The Adventures of Miles and Isabel is a well-written tale of two young Australians in the 1800s, born on the same night, to utterly different lives, who are linked through their devotion to flying. Both lead unconventional lives and thier paths seem to almost cross several times in the novel before they finally meet. This novel is enjoyable and just the right length for its whimsical focus. Have fun."
3,Can't find song on this Soundtrack (responce),"The Name of the songs many are looking for, when both girls are on the boat looking for people to con, is called ""Tropicalia"" by Beck, and the other one in where they are dancing after they just got married is called ""Oh, My Love"" by John Lennon, And because this is not a forum let me give my opinion on the cd. The CD was ok, it really should have had more, its not much of a Soundtrack. Thank You for reading."
4,The missing song....?,"OK, first of all after a saw the heartbreakers I wanted the soundtrack mainly for the mystery song where Jake (Jason Lee) and Page (Jennifer Love Hewitt) have just been married and are dancing under the stars. This song was stuck in my head all weekend, it wasn't until i had to go back and see the movie again that i found out the song is called ""Oh my Love"" by John Lennon. I hope this will end the search for the missing song."
2,Oh My Love - John Lennon,"I enjoyed Heartbreakers and thought the soundtrack would be awesome... sadly, it did not have one of the best songs played in the movie ""Oh my Love"" by John Lennon. I noticed some other people mentioned it on here, as well. If you are looking for a place to find it, try Anthology (4 cd box set) CD 1 or Imagine. Once again, the soundtrack was OKAY but they really should have included Lennon!"
3,Better in the Movie,"When I saw the movie, I thought the soundtrack would rock. It is missing a few key songs. The one when they are in the speedboat checking out rich men...that IS a Beck song, I just can't figure out what it's called. Also, the Lennon song. How could you take the best stuff off the soundtrack?I just sampled the CD online, and won't buy it."
2,missing song,"i just saw Heartbreakers yesterday, but im upset cause there is a track thats really good and its missing, its the last song of the movie, right before they show the cast and its no on the soundtrack. It sounds like a beatles song, if anyone knows what it is please email me. thanks."
2,Answer to question,"The song that Jennifer Love Hewitt and Jason Lee dance to is called ""Oh, My Love"" by John Lennon. :)"
3,shantykannan@yahoo.com,I dug this CD but was very disappointed to find that one of the best song that was in the film was not in the soundtrack. It is a song that plays at the end of the film and also in the bedroom scene with Hewitt an Lee. It sounded like a Beatles tune to me. Anyone got any ideas?
3,It's really breaking my heart!,"The ""Heartbreakers"" soundtrack is an alright one. In the trailer, you heard Britney Spears' ""Oops!...I Did It Again!"". Well, this isn't on the album. Also, I was thinking Mariah Carey'S ""Heartbreaker"" would be in it too. Well, again, I stand corrected. The album is an alright mix. No offense, but the movie is a lot better than the soundtrack. The one question I asked myself was: ""Who the hell are these people?"". The only person I know Shawn Colvin. But, I didn't know the song.Overall: Great movie, Bad soundtrack."
2,RE: a music fan,"If the song that you thought had a ""brazil flavor"" was acoustic, it is by russian musician Zhenya Rock, with the band ZEEROK. I cant think of the song title off the top of my head, but it is on his website (...). Hope that was what you were looking for"
2,Can't find song on this Soundtrack,I am looking for the name of the song in the background scene where Love-Hewitt and Weaver are on the boat scanning prospective targets. Please Help!
3,Dancing Music,"I just watched the movie, and I think it is great. The soundtrack is OK. But I couldn't find the song I heard in the movie, in which Jennifer Love Hewitt and Jason Lee walk into the room and dance together with this background song. I'm looking for that piece of music. Anybody can help?"
3,Song missing from the soundtrack,I just saw the movie today. I thought it was pretty good. I am wondering about a certain song though. It's the song where Jack and Page go into the room and the stars are on the ceiling and they start dancing. I really want to know what song that is. Anybody please tell me what song it is.
1,Missing song,"I wonder where can I find the song that Sigourney Weaver sings at the russian restaurant, ""Back inthe USSR"", in the film she sings it, why isnt it included in this cd???"
1,"I Know Where You Can Find ""Oh My Love""",Visit www.johnlennon.com You can also listen to the song while on the website!!! Hope this helps someone!!!P.S. Thanks to all for mentioning that this song was not included in the soundtrack. That was the whole reason for looking for the soundtrack!!!
2,Um what's that song,What is the name of the song that is playing right after they get married and is at the recpetion? PLEASE E-MAIL ME!! thanks
5,Best nonstick I've ever purchased,I broke down and purchased all the Swiss Diamond kitchen basics to replace my old pots and pans - cleanup is now a breeze! Well worth the investment and very practical - just make sure you measure the depth and width before ordering so as not to duplicate.
4,GOOD BOOK FOR LITTLE MONEY,"THE BOOK WAS A GOOD READ FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO LEARN ABOUT THE WOMEN IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. OVERALL, THE BOOK HAS A WORN COVER WITH NOTES AND UNDERLINES ON THE PAGES. IF YOU CAN OVERLOOK THE NOTES ON THE PAGES, YOU WILL ENJOY THIS BOOK."
3,Buyer Beware - Moog K7241 - Amazon,"Did some research and Moog comes highly recommended. We bought two of these and received one as pictured and one that looks like an over seas knock off with a smaller round removable dust boot. Both in original Moog packaging. One was missing some of the mounting hardware and Amazon is tough to deal with when it comes to issues. We had to install these the next day so the option to return and get a replacement was out of the question. Now we have one really nice ball joint and one that the dust boot keeps lifting up. Looks like we might be replacing that one in a short time. Buy local!!! look at what your getting so you can see if all the parts are there and if they are the same part. I can not recommend buying these sight unseen.I would recommend the Moog branded part as pictured, very nice well made part... Good Luck."
3,Too Short,"Excellent information for the beginner. However, for the price it was too short. It needs more information,"
5,"Horribly dated, but the fundamentals are sound","I bought this when first teaching my daughter to pitch, and damned if it doesn't work. The video is a joke, and a 12 year-old could do better now with a cell phone camera. The coach's methods are also pretty funny, as he draws a line in the ground with his foot to make a pitching mound. Come on, you are making a video. Could you at least paint a line? All just quibbling though. If you have no idea how to pitch a softball, this is the book for you. As the title says, it is just the basics, but those basics have held up over time."
3,Mediocre,"I bought this to help my 10 yr old pitch. It is a good starter in the absence of no material. The problem I have with this dvd is the material doesn't cover enough trouble shooting. My daughter's form developed very nicely thanks in part to this dvd but her accuracy wasn't improving and there wasn't much if any advice on the cause.I then purchased Windmill Pitching 101 by Nancy Evans. The cost is twice as much but it is also over two times longer and is much much better in instructing, and adds more clarity than this dvd. Also Better drill exercises and superior troubleshooting."
5,Perfect for cord of stacked wood,Arrived quickly. perfect size and weight to protect my cord of wood from falling leaves getting wet and embedded.
3,"Fun, Tinny-bopper and Hawaiian...What a combo!",I was actually in this movie. I was chasing Donny down Waikiki and screaming. It was fun! I was a teenager and had friends who knew people in the production crew. They used a lot of our friends from church. The crew was so nice to us and it was fun to watch Donny and Marie in action. I liked the movie. It was light and fun. I liked seeing all the locations around Honolulu.
3,"A cute, silly movie starring the world's perfect siblings!","This movie is not a bad movie as it's reputed to be. It's so silly that it makes it funny. Donny is very good in his role(even if he's playing himself), Marie has terrific timing at doing comedy and I love their musical numbers.A nice look at Hawaii. Ted Cassidy from ""The Addams Family"" and Kenneth Mars did good jobs at playing villains. A great movie to watch in the summertime. Donny's future wife Debra Glenn made a cameo."
3,Mandatory Mormon Viewing,"There was a saying where I grew up in the suburbs of Provo (outside of Salt Lk, and YES, hip deep in the 70's): Our parents would always start calling us inside from our intense kickball and big wheel activites when Donnie & Marie came on. Naturally we assumed it was mandatory viewing because we lived in practically Mormon-central. So our end of week goodbyes to each other went, ""Uh-oh. MMV, see ya tomorrow"". If memory serves, this movie did better than Star Wars and the Muppet Movie in Utah. Seemed that way. Anywho, enjoy much wacky shenanigans and zany capers with America's beloved icons of orthidontics. (Complete with bungling crooks and motorcycle chase). Also, I think some of the people involved with ""The Harlem Globetrotters On Gilligan's Island"" were involved. I don't know. I have to go lay down..."
2,Goin Coconuts,"The VHS took quite a while to arrive. I had ordered 5 other items at the same time and it arrived almost 3 weeks later than all the others, I actually had given up on it's showing up. The video itself rolls quite a bit at the end of the video when played. However, with the age of the movie, I will grant them some slack. I was disappointed in service and the product. I will not buy another movie from this seller."
5,Excellent Family Fun!,"Donny & Marie shot this excellent family movie in Hawaii in early 1978 and released it in October 1978. It has great music, (and soundtrack album was available in the 1970s), good acting, clean family fun. It is an excellent movie that the whole family can watch."
2,Life without a coumpass,I feel this book got lost. It was more a biography of Douglass. I was hoping for more a history of the company and the aircraft it produced.
3,Good but costly!,"Come on, it is an electronic version, no printing, no storing, no shipping! It should not cost this much! Period!"
5,swiss pot,"great product good for dinner for two.After one year of everyday use looks like new.I also put it on the dishwasher, just make sure that you do not put bleach it will discolor the bottom. That all.katiaTruckee, California"
1,Not My Type of Book,I did not like tis book at all. I just did not like this book at all. I don't know how I purchased it.
2,Did not like it. Felt manipulated in not a good way,"At first one thinks this book is very creative in showing a murder solved by an insane and homeless person. Then a couple things happen.1) You realize that this book is portraying as reality , complete lies about the homeless and the insane and doing it in a preachy way about the individual freedome and choice. What nonsense.2) I got really tired of living in the mind of an insane person which I knew was a complete fabrication, lacking authenticity. It was a surreal world of the homeless that did not bear much reality to what it is really like.I have read some of the good reviews for this book and I can understand their points. Some people are going to really love this book and the characters in it. I cannot deny that it is unique . I just did not like it."
5,Murder Mystery meets Alternative Fiction,"One of the best books I have ever read. It is enthralling, both for it's plot and it's author's ability to capture the mind of a madman with his vivid prose.Romulus Ledbetter is an extraordinary protagonist with an overwhelming personality, whose mad ramblings and desperate attempts to regain himself are hysterical, tragic and brilliantly compelling. The character study alone would be reason to buy this book, but this is also a first class murder mystery. The authors brilliant prose makes every bit ring true."
4,A worthwhile journey,"I truly enjoyed this book and would love to re-read this book at a later time. Mr. Green not only gave us a story with a plot but true character development. Romulus Ledbetter, the main character, gives prime literary heroism in this psycho-suspense drama. Although Romulus is a mentally-ill, music genius, father and husband that happens to live in a park cave; he is a social critic on the many issues that arise in this novel. This book is definitely worth your attention."
5,"A Well Written, Compelling Novel","Although it's been a few years since I've read this novel, I still remember how fond I was of it and of the author's writing style. The characters are believable, lovable, and one can certainly relate to the feelings expessed throughout the book. Overall, an outstanding read!"
3,OK,"An interesting novel written from the point of view of a homeless man.For some reason, I just didn't like it. Maybe it was the short chapters, maybe it was the vivid descriptions of a homeless person's day or the thoughts of a paranoid man. I didn't like the swearing which sounds prudish and inappropriate since swearing is one facet in the everyday life of someone who lives in the streets.Almost like modern art - you like it or you don't."
3,grossly misleading,"this book grossly misleads the public on the plight of the homeless mentally ill. it makes it seem as if it is a lifestyle choice or a matter of freedom.the illness, paranoid schizophrenia, is a deadly one that leads to self-neglect, injury and very often, death. i know from bitter experience, as i took a homeless mentally ill man into my home five months ago.people with paranoid schizophrenia do not grow pumpkins, give hugs, have friends or solve murders. they struggle to do the most basic of daily activities we take for granted. my friend has endangered his own life many times, and because of the neglect and lack of treatment, has deteriorated so badly over the years that he is now unable to care for himself.the depiction of this hero is incredibly irresponsible, and will encourage people to neglect and ignore the problems of the homeless mentally ill. this can only lead to more pointless tragedy, loss of life and suffering of the homeless mentally ill."
3,Tatsuya Nakadai in a Dario Argento scripted western,"I saw a Variety ad for an Italian western with the ad copy is the Samurai sword faster than the six gun. Have never seen that one. This has him as a Mexican Comanchero who mostly uses a pistol but has a few scenes where he uses a machete as a Samurai sword. For Nakadai fans this is a must though he has a supporting part as the bad guy. It is no Illusion of Blood or Sword of Doom but worth a look. Montgomery Ford is really Brett Halsey who is also in the Mario Bava Roy Colt and Winchester Jack. As entertainment I enjoyed the overall story, the action was well done, ditto the direction. Give it a try. When I saw it in a cheapo theatre the print had a greenish hue. This was a clean print for the most part."
3,Today We Kill Tomorrow We Die,"I loved this movie. No, it's not as good as a Clint Eastwood western, but there's something to be said for spaghetti westerns."
5,Cleo is cute!,I own my business selling doggie apparel. I bought Cleo and a few other doggie mannequins to show off my doggie clothing line. People love Cleo! She is so cute with the clothes on and the handmade collars and leashes that I attach to her. Never-mind that she has no eyes or ears; that doesn't stop her cuteness.She is well sewn and feels like a descent quality leather. She sits up well and doesn't fall down--very sturdy.Take care when displaying her--kids and adults love to touch her!
3,Good Parts and Bad Parts,"In my opinion, it wasn't the greatest book ever, but it wasn't the worst either. The first few chapters focus on characters that end up not being important. But there is vivid description.I liked the hidden romance storyline, but it could have ended better. The author ended the story oddly, it left you hanging dry.I would recommend this book to people who don't mind reading lots of chapters about traveling somewhere."
1,Trying to make a buck off Jack Ryan,"As the previous reviewer noted, the author spent most of the book explaining why things could not have happened the way Clancy described them. I'm pretty sure 99.9% of Clancy fans are aware that the books are fiction. I would guess that this author is simply looking to make some bucks off the Jack Ryan name, much the way others have doing critiques of Harry Potter or Dan Brown books. In short, Terdoslavich wrote a turd of a book!"
3,Overly Difficult,"I used four different study guides to prepare for the MAT. Barron's, The Princeton Review, and McGraw-Hill were pretty comparable in the level of difficulty of their practice test questions. The study information was well-presented, also. However, REA had really tough, obscure questions on its tests and presented a lot of information in difficult to read and absorb outline format. After taking the test, i found it to be really similar in difficulty to the McGraw Hill, etc. named above. I actually scored better on the real test than I did on most of the practice tests. I would say buy the REA guide as a last resort."
4,Good familiarization with computer format of test,"This is neither the best nor worst prep book I used - I preferred the Barron's edition because the types of questions were varied and more like the real test's questions. This book focuses on difficult analogies as well but a lot of them are history related and more obscure than the real test - so in that sense, it made me more comfortable with analogies that at first seemed unfathomable, but could be decoded with more thought. The best part of this book is the review section for mythology, etc. and the CD of tests. If I hadn't had a computer based practice test like this one, the real test would have been a lot more stressful. Also, the GRE flashcards were really helpful and those words showed up on the test- this book contains some vocab as well."
5,extremely helpful,I wish I would have ordered earlier as this was extremely helpful in taking the MAT exam. I highly recommend this source for preparing.
5,She had style! She had flair! She was there!,"Another great season of the series! I always liked this season, because you can see that they've adapted the characters very well, and still funny and full-on with the hilarious quips, schemes, flirtations, and more.The cover/case is about the same as the first seasons' case cover, with two DVD cases with the DVDs in it, and this, too, is of the leopard variety. Decent quality, and good shipping."
5,I Love Nanny!,"The Nanny is a funny, witty and entertaining show! Fran plays as a Nanny who always ends up in messy situations, but ends up finding a way out of them. She is an I Love Lucy remake with black hair. She's a blast to watch if you need a good laugh along with it's amazing cast! The butler, Niles, has a cat and dog relationship with C.C. (her being the dog,LOL) that you just can't get enough of. The second season holds one of my fave episodes with Lamp Chop and Sherri Lewis. Awesome addition to the The Nanny series, can't wait for the rest!"
5,The Nanny!!! Just great,Excellent Set!! The whole story is great.!! Fran is beautiful. I'm waiting for the Season Three!!
5,Season 2!,I really like the 2nd season of the Nanny. This season really knocks my socks off since this season has the episode with Fran Fine being a contestant on Jeopardy! one of the best I've seen!
5,More Fun With Daniel Davis And Fran Drescher !,You just have to laugh when you see the zany situations that Fran gets into. And the snotty comments by Niles the butler are priceless. Fans will love the second season of The Nanny.
5,Fantastic Fran,I love this show. I have season 1 & 2 and savor the humor like a good meal. I can hardly wait for season 3. Where are you??? I will buy them all when they are released. Perfect writers and Fran sizzles.
5,Can't Wait for Season 3!,"The second sesason of The Nanny was even better and more cost-effective than the first season. Although there is no bonus material on this set it is still worth buying as you are getting all of the episodes.Syndication is great, but nothing is better that watching the episodes back-to-back whenever I want. Please Hurry and Release Season 3 Soon!!!"
4,Holds Up Nicely,"I often buy older US TV shows on DVD to provide familiar background noise while puttering around the house. Quite a bit of it (like Married with Children and The Simpsons) simply do not age well. The Nanny is an exception.I admit I was a bit of a fan when it was on in the US, but still the DVD is well worth watching again; familiar friends who are a pleasure to see again."
5,the nanny-thecomplete 2nd season,I thoroughly enjoyed this purchase selection. If anyone ever gets the chance to watch Lifetimes Intimate Portrait of Fran Drescher you will see a side to her life like no other. You will laugh and you definitely will cry at times.
2,"Love the ""Nanny""","The ""Nanny"" is one of my all time favorite sitcoms. I was tiring of trying to be available at the different times when it airs on TV. There's nothing like having your own copy of the whole season. Even though I know all the storylines, I still laugh every time I see it. I can't wait for season 3 to become available."
5,Awesome,"I loved this series and wish I could see more on TV. I really appreciated it when they started coming out on DVD's. However, I hate having to wait so long for the next series to become available."
5,A very Good Read,"I found this book very informative and fun to read. If anyone has ever read ""The Wealthy Barber"" By David Chilton, this book goes through the same format. This book will make look to the future and the opportunities that it possesses."
5,Star Trek Baloks Puppet AWESOME,I have never seen such correct and high quality action figures. THe set is absolutely like the show. Amazing. Right down to Balok's little cup!
5,Vibrant,We love his work. I needed a smaller tropical print to go in a wall grouping. This was perfect. Very bright.
3,Go Beyond Internet Security..surf ananymously,"This software is meant for the novice who has no high end computer skills. The average computer geek who knows how to set up proxies can do without this product.Still, for a beginning user it's all right here at the touch of a button."
5,Thomas' Songs & Roundhouse Rhythms,"Sung to ""He's a really useful engine""Its a really useful cd you know, all the other children they tell you so.My little boy has played it ,he wearing out the tracksIt's a really useful cd he adores!"
4,busy Mom of 3,"I bought this cd to dance to with my 3 daughters who are huge Thomas fans. We ended up putting it in the car and listen to it on almost every outing. I wish it had the ""Rockin and Rollin"" song from the new Toby's Trackside Tunes video, but otherwise the song selection is enjoyable. We love Thomas!"
4,great songs for young fans,My sons love the familiar songs on this CD. I don't let them watch too much TV so they don't get a chance to learn the lyrics from DVDs. Now with the CD my two boys sing when they are playing with their train sets. I have lots of fun watching them!
5,Thomas' Songs review,I bought the CD for my great nephew and he loves it. Everytime we get in the truck I have to play the music.
5,great buy!,"My son absolutely adores trains, of course it all started with Thomas, we listen to this CD in my car. He loves it and singes alone. Enjoy!"
4,Always on in the car,My 3-year old requests this every time we're in the car. He doesn't make a peep on the drive.
5,Peace and serenity and upbeat,"This CD is, as another put it, one of Chris' best. It is a wonderful listen whether walking, in prayer, or just relaxing. Chris, all of your works are wonderful -- this is just one of the very best."
4,I liked it,"Although its not one of my favorites, I liked it. I was unconfortable with all those names like: Calf Boy, Small bird, Swift Foot, Many Horns, etc... but the story is nice.It takes place in Dakota Territory in 1810 it's a sequel of White Dawn, so I suggest you read that one first, because Emily is Swift Foot's first love, and this book starts when he has to marry Small Bird. He has to restore the famly's honor and in order to do that he has to marry not for love, but as a duty, he fell in love with a white woman, just like his father that brought death and pain to the tribe. But he will soon fall for his wife..."
5,Traditional European Cross Stitch Pattern Source,This book is an excellent source for motifs to be used in cross stitch. I have also used some for knitting. I wish there were more books of this calibre available.
5,Excelent Quilting Book for Beginners,I have enjoyed this book. It is very easy to follow and the quilts turn our beautiful. I would recommend to anyone interested in making baby quilts.
5,Lost my first and bought a 2nd,"I love this baby quilt book. I have used it for years; so much I lost/misplace my 1st and bought a 2nd.My favorite gift to give somebody expecting is a quilt to go with their nursery, this book handles every aspect of simple easy to be made tops in a day! I have made from cutting to quilting and binding one of these in just 10 hours. And the response to the person receiving is the best feeling in itself!You will not be sorry if you are a beginner and just getting the hang of sewing the instrucstions are very detailed and explained very clearly. I would consider myself an exper sewer and still enjoy it. I make my own patterns and create a lot of quilts that way but this is easy peasy!Enjoy!"
5,Even More Quilts for Baby: Easy as ABC,Book came on time and in good condition. I'd buy from this seller again.
1,This product is really inappropriate,I waited almost 3 weeks and I got itBut It is not suitable for nexus 4The film is really smaller than screen of nexus 4.
3,Nice book,I bought it for my niece. I looked at it recently. It is a nice book.worth the money. Like the extra.
3,Like it,"It is a good Flame torch. However, the base should have been designed to screw on and off. The base come off to easily when you set it down. Many attqachment for large and delicate soldering and heat gun. Naturally you ahve a flame torch as well."
2,unreliable,"often doesn't ignite. when it does work, it works very well.it says i need five more words. and or."
2,"It's okay, but get a steel thumb","The child-proof switch on this torch is ridiculous. Once you get that latched, and it actually ignites, the flame is fine... but getting to the flame part should be far easier than this product makes it. The first time I used this for an afternoon, I couldn't feel my thumb for days afterward!"
1,"""Deleted"" should be deleted from booklists","I am a voracious reader. And mysteries are my passion. But ""Deleted"" is so bad that I've done something I've never done before - stopped reading a book cold. The dialogue is ridiculously unrealistic, the characters unbelievable, and the plot so thin you can see the ending by the third chapter. I've never read Robert L. Wise before, and didn't realize he was a Christian bishop. Perhaps he writes rated ""G"" mysteries for his evangelical crowd. If so, his books should come with a warning label. Unless the hardest mysteries you've read are Alexander McCall Smith's, don't bother with these."
4,inspirational,"Karen Darke is physically and emotionally dealing with a paralyzing injury. But she is not ready to give up her love of climbing. The reader will find plenty of adventure here, and the pages pass quickly."
4,"Unknown author, excellent read","You can pretty much tell by page five of this novel that Andrea McKinley and Robert Dorning are not well-matched. This is a well-written, surprisingly gripping story. Andrea was deep in puppy love with Robert's illegitimate brother Jason many years ago, but Jason left to make his own way in the world. Now she's engaged to Robert, her life is pleasantly boring, and everything seems to be mapped out satisfactorily.Then Jason comes back, and her life becomes a whirlwind of confusing emotions, memories and desires. The characters (even stodgy Robert) are genuinely sympathetic and believable, and for the short interlude that is a Harlequin romance, you will come to care for them. It's too bad that one of the funniest characters in the book, Creighton Dorning (Jason and Robert's father) is dead before the book begins - you'll have to read it to find out why he's so funny!"
4,Ok,"Hat fits weird, the seams are much farther back than they look in the photo, so it looks a lil weird on your head. Delivered fast and on time."
3,a christmas carol,I'm also waiting for this album to become a cd.I have the album and it's exceptional.
3,"Where is ""A CHRITSTMAS CAROL"" ??????","This will have to do until the lawyers or whoever is involved has the great good sense to release Ernie's ""A Christmas Carol"" album on CD. I search for it every yesr, and it's always a disappointment to find everything EXCEPT that available ... and it's the most CLASSIC Christmas albums from my youth ....PLEASE, someone get it on CD before I'm too old to shre it and pass it down?"
5,Errollyn Wallen will break your heart and put it back together again.,"Errollyn Wallen's track, Daedalus, will break your heart and put it back together again. This is a quiet, absolutely beautiful testament to her power, verve and finesse as a composer. Genius."
4,Great book!!!!!,I have this book and i like it alot!!! I think the bears are cute in it!! i love to read it over and over again!! Great Book!!!!!!!!!!!!=-}
3,The bears.,This book was okay for younger kids. But it just kept repeating words. So it was kinda boring a little.
5,"""scary book"" for tots","This book is beloved by young children for building up dread and suspense ina safe environment -- with a happy-at-home climax. A reading is alwaysaccompanied by bright eyed squeals, ohhhs, and shrieks."
4,Exercise with a twist,"I have had the opportunity to take Oreet's classes, and highly recommend it to anyone! If you are unable to attend a class, the video is a fun way to exercise the body, mind and soul. Oreet is an experienced teacher who is extremely skilled, yet makes even the most beginner student feel comfortable. I never thought that Belly Dancing would interest me, let alone be a source of exercise; but to my surprise, this workout is now on the top of my list!"
3,Item name misleading,"This prioduct is not actually a ""liftgate support."" This item is in fact a liftgate WINDOW support--for the rear window which lifts separately from the liftgate itself and of which the window is a part on the Jeep Grand Cherokee. The liftgate support--which is basically larger and made to support the wright of the entire tailgate when it is opened--is another part altogether.Fortunately, I also needed a liftgate window support and can use this one on the rear window, so there is no need for a return. However, I'll be ordering the part I need for the liftgate itself from a different site as I no longer completely trust the decriptions of this item on Amazon."
4,Works Great!,"It was easy to replace the stock lift-supports on my '00 Jeep GC Laredo with these. The length was perfect and the size of the bolts they are made with fit perfectly into the Jeep's frame. I'm so glad I no longer have to worry about the lift-gate hitting my head every time I try to put groceries in the back! It may seem obvious, it is to me now, but this is definitely an easier replacement with an extra person. Once those old lift-supports are out, that lift-gate gets pretty heavy quickly if you're trying to hold it up while placing and securing the new supports in place."
4,I am a wrestling fan so this opinion could help you-!,"Now this pay per view was a bit lacking in a few points although it was fairly good.The Al Snow match could have been better if it was hardcore, not 2 great.Val Venis once again performed fairly well.The mixed match was the most entertaining match at that point of the match, it was fun and at the end Jackie's shirt was ripped off- revealing her breats! giggle.the rest of the card was alright and the ending was great.if you are not a wrestling fan but thinking about purchasing this you should because you will gain and understannding of what the wwf is all about, even if it was a bad show."
2,The WWF lets down England,"Having watched this event LIVE in the UK this was a huge disappointment, the WWF seems determined never EVER to left a title change hands at a non-US event, which may seem a good idea at the time, after all the WWF doesn't want their main audience (you American's) to miss a title change or anything, but then when it comes to selling the video it works out a little different. So them main event is a good one, fatal four way rules, ideally it would've been elimination rules but we don't want out top starts performing for more than twenty minutes and actually break out into a sweat. The WWF messed up big time, the crowd was a sell-out and fired-up, but only 90% effort was delivered. Terrible announcing and a terrible card that had half the matches on RAW the week before."
3,WWF Capital Carnage,"While it wasn't that great, it did preceed the WWF's ""Rock Bottom"" event that took place about a week after Capital Carnage. Not the greatest card but it is more worth the money than ""RB"" was. It even had some good spots and seeing Jackie's chest made it worth getting!!"
2,dimensions not as described in title,"The item description in the title says 10' x 2 1/4"". The photo shows 10 x 2. The actual register I received was as shown in the photo. If you need a 2 1/4 register for a travel trailer, this one fits loose. Otherwise, it is a well made item, especially for the money. I would have given it 5 stars except for the false description."
5,Enchanting Music from Exotic Corners of the Globe,"Chris Spheeris captures many ambient energetic cultural sounds on this CD. The musical flavour of the Meditarranean, Asia, and a bit of the Middle East is expressed in an elegant array of style and creative expression. This is music for a quiet dinner ... romance ... relaxation. Experience the vibrant dynamic life of diverse exotic places. This CD will energize the listener and release the imagination. It is delightful music which expresses the sounds of enchanted locations from around the globe. Erika Borsos (erikab93)"
5,Great dance around the house music,"All of his music is great, but if you can only get one - get this one.Sounds from many human cultures woven together very well. There are some songs here that are hard to sit still to. All in all, a very enjoyable experience."
5,Aria/ Bombay,"Hi All...Researching for Arabian Music with no words on it to ride my Arabian to for performances, I came across this delightful CD.Really expressionistic & moving in several different tempos makes this music perfect to ride a horse to!I would highly recommend this CD for anyone who enjoys music without words!I would like to find more music similar to work with!You can email me at: heavenlyhorse@horsemail.com if you can recommend music like this to me.Thank you!Riding4JC"
4,I loved this CD!,This CD is excellent for listening to in the car on long road trips. It takes the listener to many different areas in the world. This is one of the greatest musical masterpieces.
3,Culture is only commonplace,"The Greek rhythms felt right and the instruments were well played but no tracks compel another listen. ""One"" came closest."
2,A Disappointment,"The disappointment was due to my expectations. I was hoping to see lots of wildlife footage, but had to settle for an apparently computer-generated bear in one of the historical reenactments. I also expected more beuatiful scenery of the park --surprisingly absent for an IMAX film. I've seen more interesting documentaries about Yellowstone on television."
3,Not the same as theater version,"I bought this thinking that it was the same version that I watched in 1996. While it contained ""some"" scenes from that original theater version, this DVD/VHS version is vastly changed from the theater version and updated as well. It is not nearly as entertaining as it used to be, but it is more technical now... and a bit more boring. They had a good thing and changed it or updated it. So, IF you are looking for the version you saw back in the mid 90's, this IS NOT it. Its similar and has content from the old version but not close to the same."
2,"Even worse than book one, but again the potential is there...","This is the second of the Pride & Prejudice follow-on series from Carrie. Both of the first two books have VERY silly plot lines, even as she writes with grace, a sense of the 19th century, a good feel for the Pride & Prejudice characters, and so on.I recommend you start with book three: North by Northanger and read all future works by Carrie. Read the first two in the series only if you are given them as gifts and don't want to appear ungrateful."
3,not a mystery,"I liked the Darcy-Elizabeth dialogue, but calling this book a mystery will disappoint people looking for something like Stephanie Barron's Jane Austen mysteries. It's pretty much full of supernatural woo-woo, with a tiny bit of conventional mystery (whodunit) thrown in at the end."
3,Jane Austen meets the X-files,"This was one Jane Austen sequel I didn't really like. Since I hadn't read the first book in the series, I didn't know what I was in for. The writing style was good, and I enjoyed the first quarter of the book. Had the author stuck to the original plot of helping Kitty have a season in London, I would have enjoyed the book a lot. Unfortunately, the supernatural became the point of the book was and was just a little too weird for me."
2,JANE AUSTEN AND AMULETS?????,"I was initially impressed with the author's style; her writing is a lot better than most of the Austen sequels and prequels and continuations. But depend upon it, I must extend my fullest disapprobation to Bebris for involving Jane Austen characters in a story, ripped straight from the pages of Oscar Wilde, that is full of mysticism and the supernatural. Austen is rational; Bebris is not.Who wants to read about protective amulets, ghosts, and supernatural explanations that are virtually science fiction when looking for a mystery? While I see lovers of Jane Austen gravitating toward the mystery genre, I don't see fans of Elizabeth Bennet thinking it makes sense for her to be sporting protective amulets and venturing into the world of sci fi.Miss Bebris has got talent and could turn this into a decidedly decent series if she found real plots and plausable explanations. Otherwise, market the book as science fiction."
3,"Enjoyable, but disappointing","She captures Jane Austen's characters fairly well (realizing, of course, that no one can match Miss Austen). But the supernatural, curses, etc. seem very much out of place and forced. Not at all Austen-like."
2,"First half good, Second half utterly terrible","The first half of the book is GREAT! Great content, well-done characters, plausable scenarios, etc. About the time that I had become really impressed with this effort, the book took an enormous turn for the WORSE. Let me say one thing: MAGIC MIRROR (!). I was devistated by this half-baked development, but because I was so far into the book I felt compelled to finish it so I tortured myself until the very last page. I haven't been so disappointed by a book in a very long time."
1,What a bore!!,"This is one of the worst movies ever!!! It is so formulaic and boring. I can't believe the other comments recommending this movie. Dean Cain has NO charisma. I couldn't have cared what happened to him. If you want to see a real movie, get Layer Cake!!!"
1,New Worst Movie Ever!,I can't believe someone actually made this movie. The writing seems like its out of a high-school drama class. I would never pay for this movie and i 'm glad my room-mate paid for it. He paid $1 and that was by far WAY too much. The only thing that I can say I got out of this movie is that i can see any movie in the world and it will be better than this. If i ever saw Dean Kain in person i would punch him in the face.
3,"Has it's moments, Overall frustrating","Before I watched this I had no idea who was Dean Cain is (guess he is in some Superman movie). After I was done with this I discovered he is a guy sitting in a Ford F150 for almost the entire movie talking on a cell phone to get directions to an air strip in a Nevada small town. This movie was frustrating (and maybe tedious) because at every turn you think something better plot wise could've happened, but didn't. After a few more LOST turns you realize Stanton is just a moron with no sense of direction or common sense - yet he was smart enough to pull of a double crossing bank heist. At the same time, there are some brillant moments in the film. One in particular, a police car is sitting next to a billboard and Stanton approaches it ready to turn himself in and the policeman looks like one of those mannequin dummy policeman sitting there to disuade speeders."
4,Revelatory...,"This movie will change your life. The potent exploration of religious themes is conducted in a Dantean manner, with echoes of Richelieu in Dean Cain's character juxtaposed with the classical Jesuit secrecy of purpose that Danny Trejo brings to this. I might also note that this is some of Mr. Trejo's finest work, finally eclipsing the nuanced performance he delivered in From Dusk Till Dawn. As Mr. Trejo emerges as one of the finest character actors of his generation, people will look back at this role as one of the turning points."
2,Tedious,"Some bad acting here. It's very hard to give a great performance when most of your screen time is spent talking into a cell phone, which is how most of this ill-begotten suspense thriller plays out. You'll get very tired of that gimmick very quickly. There's a lack of credibility, too, as the main character spends all day and half the night aimlessly driving around the California desert in search of a place in Nevada so he can escape after a bank robbery. Minimal onscreen violence, at least. But this one is just too one-dimensional."
1,Little wonder Dean Cain doesn't star in a lot of MOVIES!,"It was just like watching a one-man improve on stage, at your local community theater. The constant inquiries with his auto club, regarding directions got really old (with Judy, the CSA). The conversation with the ""no habla ingles"" was really dumb. The highway patrol ""trash enforcer"" was sooooo stupid (gee, I would've never thought he was dead""). One of the dumbest plots I've seen on the DVD screen.I'm glad this movie went unnoticed by most of the world. Why is Danny Trejo always cast as a heavy bad guy? (Except for ""Spy Kids"") Luckily, he only shows up the last few minutes. The only good thing about this movie was the ending. Only because you're going to be glad it ended so soon. Only 80 minutes [LONG]. THANK GOODNESS!"
2,Superman gets Lost,"Dean Cain (Best Men, Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman ) stars as Jeremy Stanton a man on the road who gets kind of lost. He calls for help in which he gets operator Judy voiced by Ashley Scott (Walking Tall, Into The Blue) who tries to help him out in the situation. Along the way he talks to his family and friend Chester played by Justin Henry (Sixteen Candles, Groupies). But it seems that Cain did something he shouldnt of. In a bank robbery he switched bags and took the money for himself. Edward Archer voiced by the always great Danny Trejo (The Blue Rose, Desperado) wants his money and he's tracking Dean down. Cain is then on the drive trying to find his way out of the area he is lost in before Trejo finds him and well kills him. Predictable thriller only has some interesting moments and a pretty solid performance by Cain with great voice over work from Trejo. Also starring Andrea Gabriel (TV's Lost, Hyper) and Irina Bjorklund (The Dummy, Honey Baby)"
5,THIS MOVIE MAKE U THINK!,I SAW THIS MOVIE AND BY ACCIDENT IN LA AND THIS MOVIE REALLY MAKE U THINK. I LUVED ALL THE TWISTS AND TURNS AND DEAN KANE WAS AWSOME!!! I ALSO LIKED THE CAMERAWORK AND THE OTHER ACTORS TO. IF U ARE INTERESTED IN EDGE OF YOURE SEAT THRILLERS THEN THIS ONE IS FOR YOU.
3,not what i expected,"the movie was a little bit aggravating, it wasnt what i expected at all. its hard to watch a movie thats just pretty much one scene, one plot etc etc... i thought there would be more to it than that! but i have to say the ending did surprise me!!!"
4,a good Dean Cain film,"I enjoy Dean Cain's acting and he's been in many movies, and this is one of the better ones. He's mainly the only character in it and he does a good job. It's an interesting plot centering on him riding alone across the Nevada desert trying to get home after robbing a bank. It gets intense as he thinks he's been found out and is being followed. It reminds me of the Dennis Weaver film, Duel, as far as intensity and the main character dealing with and being followed by an unknown ""evil"" person. I like this one of Dean Cain's, along with Firetrap and of course the Lois & Clark tv series."
5,BRAVO! Wonderfully written. A must-read. Encore!!!,"Once again, I must say that Ms. Kitt has done a wonderful job. I loved the story line and the characters were well developed. There's nothing like a good ol' love story. Christine was your classic BAP and Max was strong yet sensative. I have started a collection and look forward to adding to it. Please keep writing because you are on my ""Authors-to-Read"" list."
2,dont work well,"these lights are really bright when they work! they strobe randomly. sometimes its at the same time, and sometimes its one and not the other... their still in my truck, so not a waste of money. but i would not buy again"
2,Deceiving cover,"The book is nice for people who would like to know a bit more on diamonds in general. If, however, you would like to have in-depth details of this fabulous gem, then there are much better quality books, like ""Diamonds"", second edition by Eric Bruton, or the GIA provides some nice books; Lord Ian Balfour has written an outstanding work on ""Famous Diamonds"". All in all, ""Diamonds: a Century of Spectacular Jewels"" is a nice coffeetable book, but then, if its just the pictures you like, why not buy a copy of ""Magnificent Jewels"" by Christie's, these sales are held twice a year, both in New York as well as in Geneva (Switzerland); and the photos (not to mention the prices - before AND after the sales!!) will take your breath away!"
3,Mediocre photography,"The highlight of this book, strangely enough, is the text. It explains how jewelry styles changed throughout the century in an interesting way. Unfortunately, the photographs weren't as good; they didn't accentuate the jewels very well and were sometimes slightly out of focus and grainy. In the chapter on pink diamonds, many of the photographs make the diamonds look gray. Throughout the book, diamonds described as canary yellow look like white diamonds. In general, the beauty of the gems were not captured."
2,Disappointed...,"I admit that this was a light read. I found the premise very interesting, and I didn't want to put the book down. While there were some small places in this book where the writing was very good, much of it wasn't. As well, I found some grammatical errors that irritated me. Finally, I didn't like the main character, and not because she was a prostitute, but because her personality was very weak, flakey, and passive aggressive. I found her very one dimensional."
2,Eh.... Didn't care much for it,"The book was different than any other books I've read. Then again, that doesn't say much, since I hardly ever read. It was hard to keep along with the character of Bennington, and the short choppy sentences about her feelings confused me at some point. I got a little tired of reading it, but wanted to finish it. I really felt no emotions about anything that happened with the character or characters, and the reading seemed to wisk you right through the story. I wouldn't really recommend it."
1,A load of fluff,I'll give it this: It's easy to read. But put it down and find it's pointless. The characters are drawn in crayon and pop in and out of the novel at the author's/narrator's whim. Don't waste your money.
5,Love It,"I love this book. Not because Bennington is supposed to be so wonderful, but because she is so incredibly vapid, vain and empty headed. If yout want a down and dirty description of prostitution don't read this book, however if you're looking for the spawn of ""Absolutely Fabulous"" this grab this now."
2,It looked sooo good!!,"When I first saw the title of this book I thought how could you possibly go wrong... and the fact that she's working as a call girl... I totally expected this to be a heartfelt slightly humorous read. I was totally WRONG. The character in this book is intensly unlikable that you don't really care if she ever gets out of the business... I'm not ashamed to admit that I wanted her to get hit by a bus. She was just so completely negative and there were no redeeming qualities about her.... Personally when I read a book I want to escape into a world that is better or more interesting than the one I presently inhabit, but this world made me want to slit my wrists... I'm seriously considering writing to the publisher to see if I can get a refund."
2,Not as good as High Maintenance,"I think Belle could have done better. I read High Maintenance first and loved it. I was disappointed with Going Down. It was a real stretch to believe that prostitution was the only way Benny was able to make any money, and all of her attempts at earning money by working elsewhere were sabotaged so her only way to save herself was by going back to prostitution.I did, however, enjoy the situations with Benny's dysfunctional family. I also enjoyed Benny's sense of humor about men. I was happy she found someone new in the end. I thought Adam was a jerk.I would still read a third book by Belle, when and if that happens."
1,Awful read,This was just an awful book. I guess the reality of Bennington's life depressed me. I liked High Maintenence better. Waste of my time.
1,"Crime, punishment and NYU","I'd be really happy if I never read another novel about a prostitute. The thesis of this book seems to be if you're neglected by you dad, then it's OK to sell your body. It's just a phase, like navel piercing. The Ellisesque prose limps along, and there's a bit too much detail about the inspection of johns at a midtown brothel."
4,Entertaining Mind Candy,"If you're expecting to read something profound - read SOMETHING ELSE! This book is easy to read and entertaining. I finished it in a day - time between classes, waiting for the 'L, in the bathtub,etc. It's sad and funny, but entertaining. Strictly mind candy."
1,Awful!,"This book was snivelling, self-pitying junk. Unfunny where it tried to be funny, embarrassingly affected where it tried to be sad. I didn't enjoy it at all."
2,Don't waste your time,"I was very disappointed by this book, after reading quite a few positive reviews. I couln't tell whether the author was writing it horribly or if she was trying to write it from the frame of mind of a very simple-minded character, but after a while it just became clear that the author is not a very talented writer. I would have given this fewer stars, but the saving grace was that I did have a hard time putting this down. Despite that, I wouldn't recommend this book."
4,Surprisingly Touching...Terrific read,"I was genuinely surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. It is witty and well written. You learn quickly that Benny Bloom is a character quite unlike any you have ever encountered. The book is original and touching. What will remain with me are the author's insights into the pain and loneliness that everyone Benny's age experiences. And, ultimately, the soaring joy that hope of love and acceptance brings. Even if you can't identify with her vocation, her inner life will touch you."
1,Sounded good..,"This book sounded so good so I bought it along with ""high maintenance"" by the same author. It was extremely dull, the characters had no personality or growth, and overall I was just bored. This book could have been so much more, it had a good start idea. She just went nowhere with the plot and when I finished it I said outloud ""is that it?"". Then, I attempted to read High Maintenance, and could not even finish it. So I am just not a fan of this author. The way that she writes is not captivating and I end up getting bored very soon. I would stay away from this book and save my money."
3,A year in the life of a call girl.....,"Belle takes us on a journey on one Bennington Bloom, college freshman at NYU. To pay for college she answers an ad for ""COED$"" and begins her year as a call girl.At the very beginning you realize that for all her likeable qualities she's jaded and emotionally vulnerable. I liked the character but I pittied her more. The journey she takes is told with alot of humor or I wouldn't have finished the book. As it was I struggled in the last few chapters to the end.Belle tells the story with lot of laugh out loud humor and skillfully writes about the goings on of Bennington Blooms exploits as student, call girl dejour, girlfriend, daughter, and vulnerable young woman. The story doesn't really go anywhere or expand on supporting characters as much as it just follows Bennington for a year.Although, the book was not what I expected I will read her next book High Maintenence."
3,"Helpful, but not ideal for homeschool","I bought this book because I recently started homeschooling my 1st grader. It was OK, but I think that it would be a lot better for a traditional classroom setting. Some of the activities were group activities, some were too difficult and some were do easy for him. I have had better luck just creating my own activities to go along with things that he reads. In my opinion, this would probably be good for a regular teacher, but it's not really suited for homeschool."
1,Missing the point is right...,These two guys are experts at missing the point of the gospel. They are more concerned with social issues than they are with saving souls and bringing people to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ.
4,Give it a read!,"If you were raised in the evangelical church with the Bible already mapped out and interpreted for you and then grew up and started coming to some different conclusions- then you're living out what this book talks about. If you find yourself ever thinking ""wait a minute. That doesn't say what I was taught that it says!"" then you'll want to read it! I loved this book. It described the transformation I'm going through and reassured me that I can still be a Christian and disagree with other Christians on the interpretation of the Bible. The Bible itself, of course, is infallible."
2,A Shoddy Book That Goes Nowhere,"I had high hopes for this book. Knowing the authors, I thought they would take on many of the hot-button issues of our day and provocatively challenge conservative orthodoxy. Instead, they dance around almost every topic, not wanting to say or risk too much. The end result is a bunch of mush. To make matters worse, the quality of the writing is surprisingly poor. It's almost as though they were under a tight deadline and had to scrap a few rounds of edits to get it in on time. In the end, ""Adventures in Missing the Point"" lives up to its name. It's a lightweight book."
4,Getting the Point,"This book makes an excellent study for small groups seeking an open perspective on some of the traditional hot topics in spirituality. The study questions are open ended and the responses written by the authors themselves point to the areas where differences of opinions exist. The chapters are relatively short and concise, so occasionally some extra background or clarification is helpful, but there is enough detail to provide for valuable discussion time."
3,Expensive,The Latin text is quite short and the book is mostly explanations in English. I think you are better off to buy an English book that explains the war in Gaul and the Latin text separately.De Bello Gallico: Complete Edition (Latin Edition)is just $14.90 and it contains all SEVEN of Caesar's books and the EIGHTH book by Hirtius. This plus an English book about the war will add up to around $30. If you buy all seven Colin Ewan books you'll end up paying around $130!Another interesting choice is a parallel text that features an English translation next to the Latin text:De Bello Gallico: Parallel Text English - Latin
1,Loaded with features.....But,"This phone is loaded with features. The phone would be an outstanding value... if it worked. Oh the features listed on the box all seem to be there, but the reception is Horrible. So horrible, that all the features in the world wouldn't matter because I don't care how many ""bells and whistles"" a phone has... if I can't hold a conversation with it... Its useless to me. My 6 yr old daughter gets better reception on her toy walkie talkies than what I can get with this phone. I've had two of these phones... I have already taken the first one back and will be taking the one I exchanged that one for back tomorrow. Both had the same problem... terrible hissing sound in the handset. I'm very disappointed in AT&T."
3,"Great answering machine, good features, (...) reception","As the subject is, the features and answering machine is great.But the sound quality sucks hardcore.And it gets hot pretty quickly."
1,Stopped working after 5months,"This phone worked great until the sound on the handset started crackling in and out, and the stopped working altogether. It only took 5 months for this to happen.It was also very complex to programme."
2,Looks are decieving,"This phone has neat features (example:base ringer,4 neato rings)But It has too much static. Also I notice the ear piece gets hot to quick when in use. I don't suggest this phone."
2,bad speaker phone,"I love the talking caller ID, but I also bought it to use the speaker phone feature. The speaker phone fades in and out. I was going to take it back and get another one but after reading the other reviews, I'll just take it back and look for something else. I'm very disappointed."
3,Fantastic Features with a bug or,.... My two gripes are low volume & unit going mute. Occasionally my handset will act like I've put it on mute & I have to rush to another phone. I think it might be a weakness in the function involving connection of the headset. I never have that problem when using the headset. The worst part is that I have another AT&T 900mhz that seems to have been affected by this one because it will now occasionally go mute when using the handset instead of the headset. It had never done that before.
2,Pass this one by,I love the audible alert capabilities. You can program it to beep when you have new messages and program your voice to announce certain callers when the phone rings. Unfortunately this phone is extremely unreliable. Most times I have to slam the handset on something hard so that I can hear the person calling... the funny thing is that they can hear me talking (and slamming). I'm looking for a replacement right now!
1,Features or Static,"We bought this phone about six months go and have not been happy with it at all. It does have a lot of features, but it is really hard to figure out how to use them. We don't like the way they did speed-dialing. It is not easy to find the number that you want. We can't ever remember how to erase the caller ID numbers. We always have to mess around with it until we figure it out. The answering machine part of it seems to work fine when it works. The hand set isn't too comfortable against your ear, but it is very light weight. We have had trouble hearing phone calls on this phone every since we got it. It picks up a lot of static. My husband took out the battery and put it back in which helped for a short time, but now it is back to being noisy again."
1,"Expensive phone, terrible product","The most important things to me as far as a phonegoes is the sound quality, and the battery life. Whilethe battery life seems to be fine, the sound qualityis atrocious.Spare your ears, and your friends - don't buy this thing.To boot, mine just died this week after about 4 months ofuse, and is no longer operative."
2,Not recommended,"I've had this phone for about 2 years and I already need a replacement. The reception is to the point where no one can hear me when I speak. I'm constantly being asked ""What's wrong with your phone""? If you're going to shell out a decent amount of money for a phone, then it should have a longer shelf life than 2 years. I'm relunctant to ever by a AT & T phone again. Think twice before buying this!!"
1,These reviews are hilarious!,"I have owned this phone for about 14 months. I have had static, inability to leave the immediate vicinity of the base unit, etc. Recently, the battery life has shortened so much that the phone is useless for more than 5 minutes. So, after running to grab my other phone on a conversation tonight, I thought I'd go on line and order a replacement battery. But after laughing to the point of crying over some of these reviews (love those people who are slamming their phones to get them to work) I think I will just get a new phone, before my answering machine starts blurting at me in the middle of the night!"
1,Worst & Most Junk Phone,I had this phone from last 1year almost. Poor voice quality & sometimes it refuses to connect to the base. It works only up to 20 meters from base & drops the call. Speaker phone is good and I get the nice quality in voice. I think the problem is only with the 900MHz Air interface. We are getting problem with the battery. Battery is getting last for only 5 minutes & doesn't get charge at all. Memory storage and Base access user interface is not that user friendly.
1,"Good features, very poor reception",The features of this phone are great but don't buy it. It has the worst reception and sound quality of any phone I have ever used. The features are not worth suffering through the poor reception and sound quality.
2,Unusable,The ankle ring is way too large for anyone without massive cankles to use. I bought it as a cardio substitute for exercising (didn't want to pay $60 for the original Skip-Its from the 80's). I wear a size 10 in Women's and it doesn't even stay on MY foot.
2,poor quality,"I bought this product for my 12 yr old daughter, who in the past has had a ""skip ball"" she loves it how ever this particular one is very poorly made cheap quality I look for it to break by summer time when she is able to go outdoors and use it frequently. You get what you pay for"
4,Fun for children,"this product is fun for children, however may be better for ages 10 and up or larger built children due to the size of the leg hoop sliding off of young child's leg."
2,cheap,You really do get what you pay for. The yellow ball is completely hallow. It is made from a thin plastic and it is too light to serve the purpose. I would suggest spending a few more bucks and buying better quality.
4,perfect!,i bought this toy for my niece and she loved it! the quality is close to horrible- the ball is this thin plastic- not hard like the real skip-its... but still it works fine. my niece has a great time with it so thats all that matters:)
3,Direct from the Backstreet,"This CD's was bumpin' a few years ago, there are only about 3-4 cuts on here but it's worth it to me."
2,Buy with caution,"Speakers arrived with a flaw in the finish. Looked like they were wrapped before the finish had dried. No biggie. However, tweeters were both dangling by their wires when I took the grill covers off. I reluctantly had to keep them as I had sold my previous speakers and didn't want to go through the hassle of returning them. Reattached the tweeters myself.Upside is they look awesome and sound quality is very good. Good bass, sub not needed. I would not buy them if I had it to do over again. Bought another set of speakers the next week. Nice set of Polks. Paid less but they needed a sub."
2,Why a bargain may not be a bargain?,"I bought this book because it was inexpensive and, from its title, appeared to cover any boxer topic about which I might possibly care to read. While some parts of the book were interesting, the numerous typos throughout the book were embarrassingly obvious and distracting. Also, some of the author's advice directly contradicted much of the information I have read from other boxer experts. I was left feeling like I would have been better off investing a little more money in a better quality book."
2,Very sparse,The information was very sparse and general - not particularly breed specific. Could have found the same information on the spca website...
5,briefly everything you need to know about boxers...,infact i've written all i think about the book in the subject. i've read it all in 2 days. the language is fluent and understandable. you won't regret that you've bought this book.
1,Should Read From Other Books Too,Do not confuse anymore about mindfulness breathing.I would like readers to read fromMindfulness of Breathing by Bhikkhu by NanamoliandManual of Mindfulness of Breathing by Mahathera Ledi Sayadaw
2,i hear vocies,"i love the dell's vs Dramatic but i love to find the song with the words i hear voices,but i think that's the name of the song please help (olived-enhancer@sbcglobal.net)"
5,Works,"Not much to say. It is an extension cord that works. If you like the price, you should buy it."
5,Is what it is,"Well made. Came on time, the cord extends... haven't had any problems with it. I mean hard to mess up an extension cord."
1,No good at all,"The beads themselves are nice. That's it. It is strung badly - there is a huge gap of extra string. It is NOT knotted between beads. The tassel, if you can call it that, looks like preschoolers made it. I'm going to have to spend a decent chunk of time redoing the whole thing myself. Oh, and NO ""beautiful om pouch"", just a plastic ziplock bag."
1,Melted in my toolboxes,This tool melted in my tool boxes. I don't understand contractor tools that are not designed to be stored in hot-in-the-sun tool boxes. I never got to use it.
4,What I think,A great read. I am a history major and was very pleased with the content of this book. It makes it known that there are exceptions to all popular history. If you like the comfort of being told the generic old history of the South than I do not suggest this work. It is as provocative as it is interesting. It also an enjoyable read following the modern trend of being understandable and fun yet informative at the same time.
2,Not my favourite travel book,"It's great that people are so different, both travelers and readers. I appreciate reading many different reviews to remind myself of this. On the cover, The Unsavvy Traveler promises to deliver 'excellent' and 'comic' travel tales. A few of them really are. Although I appreciated the variety of situations and writing styles, many of the stories struck me as mediocre and some were just weak: poorly written, unsatisfying, not well-ended. I appreciated reading reviews here by other readers who were left with similar feelings."
5,bodymind,should be read by everyone so they have an idea what's going on in their life---- body-mind
5,Great Book,After reading (skimming) many books trying to find this subject...here it is!!! This book ties together the mind and the body's memory unlike any other!!!
3,Basic,pretty good basic daily meditation guide. Some things too broad and don't apply to me directly but overall a good start to the day.
5,Arturo Vivante A Master of the art of the short story,"Solitude and Other Stories by Arturo VivanteVivante, a master story teller, his tales often thinly disguised autobiographyare set in Italy, the U.S and in Canada; some were published in The New Yorker Magazine and other places but never before collected into a book. I had not read them before. His stories are tightly constructed little gems to be read for the pleasure of language, theme and what I think of as set up. I love the way he introduces each story with interesting information about for example, the catamaran, the making of maple syrup, the beauty of older women, but until the end one doesn't learn why we needed to know. Vivante's stories are instructive for any would-be writer of short stories and lover of fine literature. I'm reading them for a second time."
1,Drek-o-rama!,"What a total piece of [...]!This self-published bit of self-indulgence is nothing more than a waste of paper and ink. Not only is it full of typos and grammatical errors, but whatever useful information it might accidentally contain is rendered inaccessible by the utter absence of an index.No fact included in this book can't be found more quickly and easily with a simple Google search. Buyers will learn only one useful lesson: The gullible and their money are soon parted."
3,A little pricey for a plastic key chain,"I was happy the item arrived quickly & in good shape, but it was a little pricey for a plastic key chain & the shipping was a lot too for something that light!"
2,Disappointed,"The mailbox looked great in the photograph, just what I was looking for. However when it arrived I was disappointed in the poor quality of the stainless steel (very thin). And the door was not aligned at the top. The item was made in China and the workmanship did not reflect the price of the item."
3,"good, but should be better","Nice looking mail box, but for the money, I think it should be made of a heavier grade steel."
5,Youngs Cocncordance,Very easy to understand and utilize for searching the scriptures. Easy referencing of Greek & Hebrew
3,KJV and missing words,"Young's is a good concordance. However, there are two problems with the book. First, my professor at college gave the class a list of over 20 words that had been omitted from the book. I understand that accidents happen, but you would think that somebody would take the time to add the missed words and reissue the book. Secondly, the words only match the KJV. So, if you ever want to use another version, Young's won't help. Since I'm not a KJV fan, I do not see myself using Young's after college."
1,Makes Strong's look STRONG!,"First you must have Young's translation of the Holy Bible, written in the late 1800's, for the concordance to be of any use. The translation appears to be nothing more than someone trying to make a name for himself by producing a translation that is as different as possible from the KJV. After reading his prefaces I came away with the impression that he was simply challenging, in a nasty way, the proponents of the KJV. The concordance is just about useless. It is incomplete and not user friendly. For example, as soon as I got it I went straight to Matthew 1:1 to see how useful it would be. Of two very significant words in the Young translation ""roll"" and ""birth,"" neither were listed in the concordance."
5,Excellent Bible Study Aid!,"In my humble opinion, I believe Young's is an excellent aid for anyone who either:1. Wants to know more about the Bible.2. Can remember (like I sometimes do) certain words of a verse but not remembering the location of the verse in the Bible.While some folks make more of an issue of the specific Bible translation (KJV, NASB, NIV, etc.) Young uses, I prefer to have the bigger picture in mind (like trying to remember where a verse is located!). I have remind myself that Young's is a Bible study supplement and not a Bible translation.All in all, an excellent and highly recommended supplement to God's Holy Bible!"
1,Not as handy as it looks...,"I thought this was the answer to my prayers for numeric input on my laptop. Plus it is a mouse to save space. But to use it as a keypad it really sucks. Because the buttons are recessed into the frame of the ""mouse"" you can't get your thumb on the zero key. Plus it is harder than I thought to get used to it being the ""mouse"" AND the ""keypad"".I had to return the one I bought. Uhg."
5,A quick easy way to store data!,"I bought one of these because I had a spare IDE port. It's a nice convenient way to store data, & the discs can be used over & over again!"
5,Great Book!,Great book to start with. Love the organization of it. It has been enjoyable and easy to start identifying birds!
5,gift,"Got this as a gift, it got here fast and is a wonderful bird guide, everyone enjoyed passing it around and checking it out!"
3,beginners only,"The best thing is: it's pocket sized. The bigger question is why should you tote it along? I guess this is a book for leaving by the window overlooking the feeder, if you're a beginning birder."
4,"Well organized, nice photos, but White-tailed Ptarmigan missing","Great birding book, however the ""White-tailed Ptarmigan"" and one other bird found in Colorado (can't recall the species) is missing. Waiting for the author to release a corrected edition."
5,underrated funk classic,"jerome brailey fed up with george bailed out the mothership, and made these slept on classics, the bomb as jerome proved he can hold his own, and even makes fun of george, yes rappers are not the only ones who have beef. get this even though this is anti-p, no funkateer is funked up without this cause this is a part of p-funk history as well as the other lost classics remember sweat band, quazar, philippe wynne, space cadets, junie, i can go on."
4,Surprise for my grandaughter!,"I had to get this for my grandaughter. Her daddy is a Geography professor. My daughter said that it is well constructed and portable. They can take it when they travel. The zippered case keeps all the ""states"" together when not in use. We would recommend this to any child that has an interest in learning."
3,Great except for TYPO!,"I was pleased with this toy until I noticed that Vermont (abbreviated VT) is embroidered as NT instead. If you click on the ""Zoom In"" button of the photo above, you can even see that it's embroidered NT. I just wrote to the company to see if they have a replacement piece as I don't want my daughter to play with a wrongly labeled state."
5,Very Intense,This sermon is so real and eye opening its crazy. Bishop Jakes brought this word forth with power and authority. I was blessed. I listen to it almost everyday and I always learn something new.
5,Good DVD,"This DVD contains many routines that work well for those of use who are inflexible - it has modifications to help out and uses things, such as chairs, to help out if needed.There are three main selections, Short Routines (Basics), Short Routines (Some More) and Extended Routines for when you progress further. Routines range from 6 minutes to 90 minutes, with good short routines in the first two sections, 1/2 dozen 6-15 minutes workouts, so they were doable.This DVD is perfect for me since I am new to yoga and inflexible. I have been using it for awhile now and it has been worthwhile to me."
5,Great for Beginners,"Originally I purchasedYoga For Weight Loss for Beginnersbut found a lot of it difficult, partly because I'm overweight and partly because I've lost a lot of flexibility as I get older. The first two routines on it come from this DVD and I ordered it instead. It's great! A lot of the standing poses are with a chair which makes it so much easier. Each day I get a little more flexible and soon will be able to do the included routines without props. This has a lot of short routines to get started, then when you progress, there are several long work-outs so I definitely have goals and can meet them without more purchases. I highly recommend to anyone overweight/out of shape/just beginning."
2,Disappointing,I expected more instruction. Having the demonstrator start in a perfect yoga position was not helpful. Either have a second person motioning/pointing to the area you are supposed to be stretching straightening tightening or have the person demonstrating start off standing like a 'normal' person and then morph into the pose.
5,Simple and soothing,"This is my first yoga dvd and I was pleasantly surprised. The setting is very very soothing and her voice is very calming. I like how they take the time to get you in the right position and the modifications are great, like using a chair for sun salutations and using a blanket for seated poses. I enjoy doing this in the mornings or when I'm just needing a break. Maggie is a great instructor and they did an A+ job on this dvd."
5,A Great Stretch,"My husband is still new to yoga and not very flexible and this DVD is perfect for him. The poses are gentle, varied and easy to follow. He says he feels that my body has increased mobility. The instruction is very clear and allows him to get into the poses in a non-rushed way. Even though I have been doing yoga for awhile, I also use this DVD from time to time because I like the instructions and flow and to reinforce some elements of my practice.It was also filmed on a beach, the scenary is gorgeous and is an added bonus."
4,Nice second step,"This was my second yoga dvd purchase and while I enjoy it, I would like the flow to be a bit smoother. It's excellent for instruction and gives you plenty of time to get the pose properly executed, but doesn't seem to move from one pose to the other in a free flowing manner."
3,favabean,This dvd is for real real beginners. It uses a chair for a lot of the poses. Not challenging at all.
2,Bad DVD,"I was really disappointed with this video. I hate the fact that it is a voice-over. The ""Yogi"" is like a robot...it is actually distracting that she is just going without pausing and explaining the proper poses...bad bad DVD."
3,Yoga for Inflexible People,"I can't really put my finger on it, but it's just not what I expected for a beginner yoga DVD."
5,Great!,"I have only done the deep relaxtion ""work outs"" and they were phenomenal. Definitely well explained-- easy to grasp--and here's the kicker-- I really did find a deep centered feeling of relaxtion and peace."
5,Moving Towards Flexible,"This has helped me move towards my goal of becoming more flexible. It has three main sections, the first two are showing a variety of basic poses. Though they are modified, there are variations that even more modified to help you if you need it.Depending on how flexible you are some may come quicker/be easier than others and I was able to get them all. (My places where I was less flexible took a bit more work to stretch them out, but over time they did.)The last section are longer routines to help focus on areas, such as hamstrings, some more.Very well done DVD and the instructor made yoga accessible to me, something I never thought would happen."
3,Mis-matched vocal explanation,"The video part of the demonstration is great, the postures are very professional. The accompanied vocal instruction, however, does not match up to the moves of the video. The narrator frequently mistakes the left and right side and often leaves out narrating the next steps. This can be very confusing for people following the videos at home. The instructor also does not provide cool-down poses."
3,it's ok,This was ok....it did break down the moves to simple poses but you only do that one pose....makes it hard to get a full body stretch
3,Just Okay,"I thought that this video was just okay, but certainly not great. The instructors voice-over is very obnoxious and repetative once you have watched the video several times. I like that the video didn't take long pauses to introduce every pose, but I do wish that the pace would have been just a little bit slower. Beginners do not have enough time to get into a pose correctly, let alone to feel the pose and its effect on their body. I most definately would not buy this video again."
5,No Longer A Plank,"I had very little flexibility, and for most of my life I was never very flexible, so looked into yoga based a friends recommendation.This DVD sounded like a good one for me to try, and it has worked well in helping me get flexible. (Not ""Cirque Solei"" flexible yet, but more so I do not feel tight all the time in my legs, arms and shoulders.)She does a good job of explaining the poses and it is a pace that worked well without being slow.Good DVD that I would recommend if you need some help and starting yoga."
1,too fast and too repetitive.,I didn't like how quickly she went through all the motions. It seemed as soon as you got into the pose you were quickly moved to the next. She used the same movement over and over each time adding a tiny difference. I didn't find that helpful. I'm a beginner and this was not challenging or fun at all. Very disappointed.
5,Absolutely Brilliant!,"I purchased these books as both ice breaker to guests in my home, but also to give a good reading. Well the books are a simple read, one a day. The information contained in these books is absolutly worth its weight in gold. In fact when put into to practice, you almost immediatly become memorable as one who values certain lost traditions.As a conversation starter, well, the females in the group will pick one up, flip through and eventually make a remark such as ""why don't you ever do that"".....I highly rate this book as it is a truely wonderful (although trivial to certain people) book. An art that was lost, of on the fall could certainly be picked back up again."
5,"Good Grill, Good Value","I've had this style Weber grill for four years. The grill starts easily, cooks evenly, and needs minimal care. I have cooked steaks, chicken, burgers, pizza, corn, french fries, home fries, and chocolate chip cookies on this grill. I like to bake whole chickens at 500 deg F, and this grill is great for that. ( At that temperature, the fat soils a kitchen stove completely.)I don't miss the side burner, but that is your choice. This is the right model for me. The current price is that same price I paid four years ago. If you have natural gas service, get this not the propane model."
1,not worth it compared to older models,"The problem with this Natural Gas Weber Grill model is that, when the grids get hot, the welds actually break. The welds also warp. If anything, I should get a coupon for some free grids. I bought four, yes that's right, FOUR Weber grills for four separate homes, and ALL OF THEM warped in about TWO WEEKS! How about some refund. Whatever happened to the quality of the original grills when they first came out???"
2,Trailer is misleading,"This film is awful. The trailer looks pretty epic, but that's about as epic as the film gets. Otherwise you have to sit through awkward and tedious (and incredibly badly done) scenes in ""Thames, England"" and utterly boring and awful love interest nonsense in China. There's more yapping and longing looks in this film than there are any good fight scenes. Sammo Hung phoned this one in at best. Really disappointing. Horrible story, horrible acting, uninspired martial arts."
1,fight the fight,junk movie very bad.I would not rent this movie again I would be surprised if you make it past five min.
1,Interesting expose?,"The subject matter (the self proclaimed 'Body') and the author both fail to excite interest. Serious authors would do well to portray Bush or Bradley. Jesse is at the 14 minute, 55 second stage of his fame, and we can only hope that the author will explore more appropriate topics (the Oprah or Trump candidacy, for starters!!!). Avoid this book like the plague......."
1,Horrible read,"Books like BODY SLAM create the impetus for a 0 stars Amazon rating category. Unimaginative, sensationalist, dumbed down reading on the soundbite candidate du jour. Appropos subject matter for this mediocre(at best), pop-culture writer."
1,TERRIBLE!,"The book's garish, campy cover does justice to the actual content of this schlocky book. Inane, boring, shallow analysis coupled with the low-brow antics of the sleazy Ventura (don't believe the hype, Ventura is a flash in the pan). What compelling book does Tapper have in store for us? Pray we don't find out......"
1,Disappointing,Who in their right mind would compare Tapper to Norman Mailer? (Read: the author or his close friend) The book surely did not lack the titillating details of the Body's turbulent life. But the book read more like pulp than a serious political or biographical analysis. I was extremely disappointed; to say the least.
1,Absolute waste of time and money,"Intellectual cotton candy and complete puff piece for this political flash in the pan. This read like some political 'Hammer of the Gods' (you know, the smarmy Led Zeppelin bio). Provided no insight to the Ventura phenomenom. At least it ONLY cost a Mickey D's value meal....."
1,"Nice try, Jake","A masterful job? I can't help but question the authenticity of that review. This book failed to deliver on the relevant and compelling story of what could be the political story of the 2000 campaign. Ventura's straight shooting, in your face and often tactless persona invites readers to delve deeper into Jesse's life. Tapper dropped the ball on this one, big time. Maybe Edmund Morris can add meaningful perspective on the 'Body.'"
2,Somewhat Informative,"This is the first book/first anything I've ordered on-line (I ordered it in December and received it on Christmas Eve). Very prompt and professional service. Anyway, as far as book content, this (the book) wasn't written professionally by any means. It appears to be aimed towards WWF fans with WWF mentality. Or at the very least (and most charitable), young people and/or people who don't have a large vocabulary. It was informative, however, gave a different perspective on ""the Body""! The author interviews people who knew Jesse in different stages of his life. Any book or video on Jesse Ventura, whether authorized by him or not, will draw me to it like a magnet! Huge fan, huge follower, agree with much of what he has to say! Having been raised 5 minutes or less from Minnesota, there's a more personal connection for me! :) I highly recommend this book to any fan of Gov. Ventura's!"
1,Pathetic and Offensive,"I read this book to get an idea of what the masses are learning about Jesse Ventura. I'm a political science buff in Minnesota and can tell you that this book is a shallow portrayal of our surprisingly complex governor. Poorly written, poorly researched, this book was quickly written for distribution in grocery stores ect. This is not a serious or insightful biography, and should be avoided."
2,Strips Easily,"I purchased this at a local hardware store to fix my xbox 360 (it had the torx 8 and torx 10 sizes required) and worked great at first. I got the entire xbox taken apart, but then when it came time to put back together the torx 8 bit started to strip. I was extremely frustrated as I had just reapplied the thermal bonding stuff...and do not have a full set of tools. I was able to cut the tip of the bit off using a pair of pliers and finish the job (which is why I gave the product 2 stars), but I would not trust it to work again.Strongly recommend another torx tool."
5,Extremely Pleased,"This was a gift to my wife for Valentine's Day. A good friend of hers had one and after she tried it, that's all she wrote! We have been extremely pleased with this unit and would recommend it to anyone considering purchasing one."
2,Broken when receved,this product came poorly packaged from Amazon. Because of this the machine came with many broken parts including the pump.The only saving grace is that Capresso has great customer service and will be sending me out a new one after the holidays.
3,"yellowing, but still readable, my grandkids love it","My grandkids have already had a lot of fun with the craft book. It is a little older than I expected, but no problems reading. I recieved it quickly"
4,This was a great book!,It is great for home schooling. The kids were very excited and proud of the book. The only thing we didn't like was that the first time we opened the book it fell apart. We want to keep the book because we like all the projects. It should hold up to children opening the book up.
2,Not worth it...,I thought this would be a great book to keep my kids entertained over the summer. After I received it I realized this was not the book to do it. It is very outdated and the projects are not very attractive. Overall I am glad I didn't pay very much for it because it is just going to sit on my bookshelf.
1,horrible,this book only has about 20 crafts and almost all oif them use thread or pipe cleaners. They should have all of the supplies in the book but they make you go to the store and buy it. The crafts are not interesting and very boring. I suggest you don't buy this book.
5,TRANSFORM YOURSELF INTO AN ARTS & CRAFTS EXPERT OVERNIGHT!,"This is a fabulous book to have on the shelf. My daughter loves to do art projects, so now we have an endless supply of ideas for things to do at home. Now I don't have to say to myself ""why can't I ever come up with things like that to do at home"". Most importantly, the book has instructions that really explain how to do things so that they come out properly!!! EASY INSTRUCTIONS!!!"
5,The Chambermaid,"Great. Even my MOTHER liked this, in fact she wanted to watch it AGAIN! Fiona Horsey is SO HOT...and the storyline and the ending were things of sheer genius. I kinda am interested in what other things Wolfgang Buld has directed."
4,excellent,"We all know how modern women treat us, men, and this movie proves it all the way to the end. Luckily its only movies where we pay ultimate price for thinking with... ehhh / I wonder if word dick is ok / but anyway the movie is plain perfect. My only complain is we do not see female's actress main private parts but I am sure it will happen sooner or later."
3,A Thin Book,"This thin book was even thinner on the late days of the Railway Express Agency. I was tickled at the detail Klink Garrett gave for his early years, but this detail was skipped after his move up the corporate ladder. I think they spent themselves into oblivion and nobody seemed to care. Did they fall, or were they pushed? Did Klink help or hinder? I couldn't tell and Klink didn't either. Still, it was an interesting story about a big company that just up and disappeared."
5,EXCELLENT!,"This is a great multi-artist compilation album, featuring some of the biggest names in Christian Contemporary. They have taken the all time great Christmas songs and put a nice spin on them. Jaci Velasquez' title cover title song combining Silent Night and For God so loved the World is an ititial shock at first, but over time, it has become one of my favorite Christmas songs. Phile Keaggy's duet with Kim Hill is nothing short of remarkable. There is something for evryone on this Great CD!!"
5,"great title, laugh out loud humor","The title is brilliant, his humor just right, and I always appreciate a fellow libertarian.Mostly, his book is common sense. War is often a necessary evil that has produced more peace than anything else. Rich taxpayers and the Marine Corps do more for world peace than the 1% of Ben & Jerry's profits that are set aside for that purpose - but then that's stating the obvious, isn't it?Plus, always relying on diplomacy is nave, unrealistic (remember Hitler?). People are inherently evil, not good.And I never knew that O'Rourke used to be a ""long-haired peace creep"" back in the 60s, although it makes him more authentic. He's been on the Other Side, so he knows what they believe firsthand, making him an excellent critic, far more knowledgable than people who have been either strict liberals or strict conservatives for their entire lives. A ""reliable narrator."""
2,Not His Best Work,"I didn't even finish this one. Even though I don't agree with PJ politically, I usually find him funny at least. Not this time."
2,Give me a break,"Typical O'Rourke drivel. Heres how it goes. PJ gets Rolling Stone to pay to send him to Lebanon, Panama (circa Noriega) and some other places where they have lots of guns and bad manners and little of anything else, in the hopes that he will get drunk enough to wander out from the hotel bar, see some ""bad stuff"" and come up with something funny to say about it. His humor is pointed and well placed at times. Most of the time though he, merely, uses the humor to set up some libertarian screed. Heavy reliance on Cato institute,intern-toadies(who fact check, research and do the academic heavy lifting) at times gives O'Rourke the appearance of knowing his arse from a hole in the ground....do not be fooled. PJ is a Hunter Thompson wannabe, but who lacks HT'S gonads. SKIP IT."
5,Looks beautiful in my daughter's room.,"I bought this right after I found out I was having a little girl. After have a boy, I was ready for something really girly, and this is it. Very feminine and pretty. I loved the stuffed teddy bear on the comforter."
5,This bedding set is perfect for girls,"We looked at alot of bedding sets at the stores and also online, by far Ballerina Baby-perfect! For [item price], you cannot find a bedding set that has everything in it already. My husband and I recommend Ballerina Baby to any expectant parents. Thank you Kids Line for an excellent prouduct."
5,These make great gifts.,"I just ordered my first spoon from Beaded Things a couple of weeks ago. It was beautiful! My friends loved it. Beaded Things has great customer service, too. You will not be disappointed."
3,copper bowl,"I was disapointed in this bowl, because it doesn't stay upright as pictured...the bottom is rounded and picture is deceiving."
4,A must for making Angel food cakes as grandma did,"This bowl is amazing. Anyone who wants to make really GOOD angel food cakes should get this bowl. It is of very good quality and looks very elegant. Its wall is thicker than other competing brands and it has the perfect size for beating a dozen egg whites. I love it...The only drawback is that the outer-surface oxidizes easily, even though it is finished. It showed some green spots after only a few weeks. Maybe this is common with copperware.So I give it a five star for the inside surface, four star for the outside surface. But for angel food cake fans, it is the inside that counts. :-)"
5,d. murphy,"This bowl is superb for its intended purpose, namely to whip egg whites. The unlined copper is the material of choice and the round bottom facilitates the whipping of the egg whites. Considering the care needed to maintain unlined copper and the awkwardness of a round bottom, it really has no other practical use (other than to hang as a decoration)."
4,Easy Solution for Spinning Bowl,"There are a number of complaints about the bowl's round bottom. If you don't want to buy the stand, just put a couple of moist dish towels in a circle on the counter and sink the bowl snuggly in the middle. This helps prevent my bowl from spinning while whipping batter or egg whites. Hope this helps."
5,Essential,"A copper bowl is a kitchen essential. I use mine not only for meringue, but also for melting dark and white chocolate by fitting it into a saucepan like a double boiler. The latter has a groove around it that makes it difficult to remove all the contents, but it's easy to get everything out of aa round bottom copper bow, but a simple caveat: after using anything with oil, such as chocolate, clean the bowl carefully so as not to leave a single trace of oil or grease; otherwise, your egg whites will never whip.l"
4,Beautiful Copper Bowl,My daughter was extremely happy with this bowl and it was more inexpensive than the local shops. It arrived in plenty of time for her birthday
5,Top of the line,It is a thing of beauty!It is heavy enough not to dent easily andmakes the stiffest nicest egg whites ever!
2,It almost fits,"I bought this as a replacement for a 2002 Jeep Liberty Limited. Once I started installing it, I discovered 2 misfit problems:1. The A/C condenser lower mounting brackets were different than on the original radiator. This required a slight mod to the new radiator and required cutting the rubber air flow directors to fit around the modified brackets.2. The fan mounting screws were spaced too close together so that only 1 mounting bolt could be installed.Everything else fit and the radiator is now installed. I haven't had a chance to run the Jeep for any extended time so can't comment about performance.Bottom line:I would not buy this again because of the misfit issues."
3,Not the best,"I would rate the two out of the three episodes as rather weak. The saving graces were the Rudolf Nureyev episode, Vets Hospital, and Statler and Waldorf rating the Muppets performances."
1,The Best of the Muppet Show,"Dear Sir or Madam,I cannot comment on this CD, since the CD I received was defective, and I sent it back to the seller."
5,Chuck Berry Songs,"This is a great, great CD. It brought back so many good memories of when I was a young kid. It has the best of Chuck's songs that we all love. I play it in my car and in the house all the time."
5,"""Johnny B. Goode""- The Original Rock Classic!!!","Chuck Berry recorded most of the tracks on this album way before MTV had corrupted the Nations Youth's Attention Span with it's 3 minute flashing video's. Back when this album was made an artist stood on the merits of his songs , not on how many half naked women he could get shown on the Video Clip of his latest single.Now I will get off my soapbox and review this album. This album contains the timeless ""Johnny B. Goode"" which is played by every rock and roll cover band in this country if they want a paid gig on Saturday night.Chuck's guitar work is innovative and unique and is often imitated but never superpassed. This album rocks!!!"
5,Let me hear some of that rock and roll music,"This is the definitive single disc Chuck Berry compilation. The title says it all. It contains 28 great songs. Not necessarily Chuck's ""greatest"" songs, but great nonetheless. ""You Never Can Tell"" is unquestionably one of Chuck's greatest songs, and it's not here. But, c'est la vie. The songs that they do include are great, so I won't complain. Highly recommended."
4,Great Chuck Berry,"Some of the newer ""remastered"" packages have better sound quality, but if you are looking for a restrospective sampling of some of the best ""roots of rock n roll"" music ever, this might well be it. 28 songs on one cd, I mean you will feel like you have died and gone to Chuck Berry heaven. The full staple of hits is here, including some gems little heard. My favorites next to the ones everyone knows would be ""30 Days""...a real cookin classic and ""Nadine"". This version of ""Roll Over Beethoven"" is simply the best ever done...not many songs will give a person goose bumps or send a shiver down the spine, but this is one of those....absolutely fantastic! It is no wonder so many of the world's greatest rock n roll groups were influenced by Mr. Berry...he had the soul to make rock n roll great."
4,All the best from one of the founding fathers,"If you are a fan of ""classic rock"" then you have heard Chuck Berry's influence all over the place - the Beatles, the Stones, John Fogerty, Bob Seger, the Allman Brothers, ELO, Santana - the list goes on and on. This collection showcases all the best of Berry and his long-time piano player extraordinaire, Johnny Johnson. This is great music to listen to even today, not just some historical artifact.The one fault in this is that not only did Chuck have a big influence on others, he also had a big influence on himself. Many of the songs sound similar to each other. For instance, ""School Days"" and ""No Particular Place to Go"" are practically the same song. But if anyone has a right to copy Chuck Berry, it is Chuck Berry."
2,Chuck deserves better..,"Dont get me wrong, I love Chuck Berry! But this CD just doesnt cut it. There are twenty-eight songs packed onto a single CD which usually means that the songs are really poor quality.Most of the songs are in mono, and the pamplet in the CD says and I quote:""This compact disk contains program transferred from analog tape and therefore may contain some tape hiss and other anomalies that exist with analog recordings""And yes there is a hiss, quite audible. For godsakes, my FM car radio plays the songs better.The only reason to buy this CD would be if you absolutely absolutely want all his greatest hits on a single CD. Otherwise I suggest that you buy to the other Chuck Berry collections available on this site even if they are slightly more expensive."
2,Sent wrong item...it was pink,"I had to return this item as I purchased it for my son. They sent the pink version of the iQuest and told me that the description said 'colors may vary'. I was unable to find those terms anywhere and with 'Red' in the item title, I felt they were wrong. If you are looking for red specifically, don't think you will get it. I had to return the item for a refund at my own expense on shipping.I had to purchase the item itself from another vendor. On the plus side, my son loves the one I finally found him. He is 10 and has his own PDA now."
4,How cool - Educational,This is a great toy.If you forget to study you just pull this out! !Quest out and start studying. It has every grade level( I hope).I'm sure to get this piece of device.I'm sure you are to. And if you do be sure to get a good grade on your pop quiz.
3,Great while it worked!,"I gave the IQuest to my son for Christmas. It worked for less than one day. I have sent three emails in the last three weeks to Leapfrog's customer support, but so far have only gotten an ""we received your email, and we will get back to you"" type of response. If this ever gets resolved, I think my son will really enjoy it. My advice: if you get one, keep all the original packaging, and receipts handy so you can return it to the store you purchased it from. So far, I am not impressed with Leapfrog's customer ""service""."
5,"excellent, worth the money!!","I quest is very well built because it is so small. I plan 2 things at least every day on the schudle! The anagram game is my favorite topic though, it is very hard and you feel silly at the end when you miss obvious words like oak or eye. It also comes with a cartarige with math science and social studies. Over-all this was definitly worth the money!"
4,Valuable Educational Tool,"As with any educational product of this type, there is a lot you can get out of it if you want to. I purchased one last year for my daughter in 6th grade and got a lot of use out of it. By being able to download questions from the books she was using, she always had a handy review with her and was one step ahead of the class. It also comes in handy when they forget to bring their books home. We travel a lot with sports and this is a very good tool to use in the car to study. She will be using this through 8th grade and loves it. I am now in the process of ordering another one for my younger daughter who is starting 5th grade this year."
4,My iquest,"I really like my iquest. Ive had it for 2 weeks. It is very educational, and fun. I needed help in science and its helped a lot. I think everyone who needs help should have one. Ive been wanting one for a long time. It is very durable because I droped it twice and it didnt even get a scratch. I cant wait to get the other cartridges and the mind station so I can download my text books into my iquest. Thats why I like it, and I think everyone should have one"
4,"Great, fun preparation for SAT/PSAT!!","I have a daughter who is a sophomore in high school, so I wasn't sure if this would be appropriate for her. She requested it for Christmas, so I went ahead and bought it. I also purchased the SAT/PSAT Test Prep workbook and cartridge. She loves it!! I just wish there were more textbook downloads for the high school level."
3,Better than the stock seat,"I wish Schwinn supplied this seat with my bike when I bought it. This seat is waaaaaay better than the original. But at the same time, there are better seats than this one. It's the right price though. Can't argue with the price tag. You get what you pay for."
5,Comfortable Seat,We ordered this as a replacement to my husband's uncomfortable bike seat and he loves it. It's wide and cushioned to make biking much more comfortable for him.
1,Terrible ride.,Can't handle the chafing and sore butt while riding. Good for shock but that's about it. Probably good for kids. Not adults.
3,Just Okay,"Not bad, but this seat is not the softest. Don't get me wrong, it's softer than a BMX seat but don't expect to ride for hours on end without feeling the pain! For the price, it's worth it though."
1,Hard as a rock.,"Just got this seat, used it once 2 days ago, and it was hard as a rock. My a** is still sore!!"
5,Fantastic bike seat,Very comfortable for me as opposed to the thinner race and mountain bike styles. I used to have a sore butt after awhile but this seat easily fixed that problem. A friend purchased it before I did so I knew what I was getting... I couldn't be more satisfied.
3,Ehhh needs adjustment...,"Out of the box it seems very soft & cushy but once I installed it after about 10mins it felt hard. I took it off and took a better look at it, Theres 2 screws that you need to loosen up to make this seat work better, I guess the factory overtightens them to be sure, but by doing this they totally compress the rubber springs making the suspension/cushion useless. I just loosened the screws and now the seat works 100% it was $$ well spent. All & all a pretty good seat with plenty of cushioning. Just wanted to pass this tip off"
3,"Not bad, not great.","I was in desperate need of a more comfortable seat for my bike, other than the one my bike came with (some NASA engineered poly carbon, .5 ounce, aerodynamic, HIGHLY UNCOMFORTABLE seat!). Thought this was the one, but it's really just OK. It is very comfortable on the ""rear"" butt-bones but the front of the seat kind of angles upward and and is a bit uncomfortable (at least for a male if you know what I mean!). Will be putting this on my wife's bike and continue my search for the right seat.BTW, it's a bit larger than it looks in the picture as well. Looks a bit funny on a high end mountain bike."
5,"Great product, fair price",Much more comfortable than the original seat on my mountain bike. Good pricing. Worth the purchase.
5,Best I've ever had,"This is a very comfortable seat escecially for the older rider, these are much better than the ""wedgee seats"" that come on new bikes. You can glide right over the bumps without wincing in pain.Great job Schwinn."
2,Not Comfortable,This seat was not as comfortable as advertised. This is perhaps one item you would not want to buy online. Go to a bike store and actually try seats and feel the cushion before purchase. I had to return this item.
2,Not Great,The size of this seat is not suitable for taller/ big people. I find the size of this seat irritates me when I am using it and I'm not even heavy. I recommend something different for taller/ bigger people.
3,schwinn bike seat,"you get what you pay for. To the touch of your fingers it feels like a pillow but to the butt not so much. It's not the most comfortable, so it will do the job if you dont plan on riding a Marathon."
2,Terrible design!,ok.. I am coming from a hard tail seat which on my mountain bike .... and it was slick and easy to slid in and out of.This has some nice padding... but not as good as I would have thought it would be. It was still hard in the tail when riding.ok here is why I rated it LOW:The material makes your pants/shorts grab when you push back into the seat. It is NOT sleek like most seats. For that it is coming off right away!
3,Bike seat,"I'm still getting used to this seat. I'd say that 'Pillow Top' is a misnomer. I find the seat a bit stiff, but maybe it still needs to be broken-in."
4,like it,It is well made and the price is fair. The surface is not super soft but comfortable enough for me. Looks nice.
4,Very comfortable and works well to protect male riders....,"Ordered this product to fit a tired rear end. I always avoided bike riding due to the uncomfortable feeling that was associated with this activity. I ordered this seat after reading the current reviews and thought that it would be fine for my 1 a summer ride. Well I have used my bike with the grandkids now 3 times and no more pain.....Thank's to it's makers and suppliers.Jeff MackeyAurora, ILL"
4,Feels Great!,"This was the third seat for my Schwinn Sidewinder (Woman's Bike). The longest ride for me has only been two miles around town, with some gravel and back roads and I experienced just a little soreness afterward. It was gone the next day. The two seats prior were Bell and I will admit that the Bell products were OK before I had the Schwinn Pillow Top to compare to! I think anyone looking to completely eliminate any backside discomfort will find any product disappointing, no seat can take all the pressure off."
3,"Es comodo, pero no para MTB","Aunque es un asiento muy cómodo, por su aspecto físico es prohibitivo para una bicicleta montain bike. El asiento es demasiado ancho y plano.Recomiendo el asiento para bicicletas tipo Banana, o para una persona que no le importe la apariencia y el peso. Pero para una bicicleta mountain bike NO."
2,Does not fit a typical woman's seat.,"This is comfortable, but if you have a woman's seat, it barely makes it over and will pop off. I wish I had known this before I bought it."
3,Just not soft enough,"That says it all. Better than what came with the bike, but, still not soft enough. Also, could have been a little larger."
3,"For a product that says ""Pillow Top"", it's really not very soft.","I bought this for my brother-in-law, but it was nowhere near soft enough for a 360lb man... It's on my bike now, since my seat was really getting old. It's not nearly as comfortable as I had expected, but it does seem to be well made and quality materials... Just be aware that it is not all that soft."
1,Not to comfy after an hour of riding,"I got these seats based only on the reviews of others and I was so let down. For the first 40 min it feels fine but on long rides your but will start to hurt. After an hour I couldn't sit anymore. I can't even feel the ""gel"" there is so little of it. Don't waste your money."
1,Utterly atrocious,"I purchased one of these seats and in less than three weeks it began to slip out of position and became impossible to secure. Upon inspection, I found that the clamps holding the seat to the post had been worn down to nubs. Clearly an inferior product. Do yourself a favor and spend the money for a well-made seat."
1,Uncomfortable!,"This seat is somehow even less comfortable than the regular seat that came with my bike. It is not soft or springy at all, and the grooves from the design make it even worse than just a flat surface. The name ""Pillow Top"" is nowhere close to accurate."
3,Better than original equipment.,I bought this for my wife's 3-wheel schwinn bicycle. We are elderly people (in our 60's) and it does provide better comfort than what came on the bicycle but I think there must be something better out there for upright riding and longer lasting comfort.
1,"Not comfortable, hard as a rock!","Ouch is all I can say about this ""pillow"" top seat. Not comfortable at all."
3,A pretty Firm Pillow,"I purchased two of these for a pair of Schwinn Le Tours.The design of the Le Tour throws away the mounting brackets and the seat rails are connected directly to the seat stem, which means you loose the ability to adjust the ""pitch"" of the seat. My wife felt the resulting angle made her feel like she is pushed forward, but she expects to get use to it.Neither of us would describe the seats as ""pillows"". The padding is moderate and the springs are very firm.That said, they are more comfortable than the original equipment on these bikes.They look good and were very simple to install and at $20, a good deal.To make them an ideal ""pillow top"", I would have preferred a more cushionier spring."
2,Will not work on a Schwinn Airdyne Exercise Bike,"Even though it's recommended by Amazon when you purchase an Airdyne exercise bike (Items Frequently Bought Together), this seat will not work. The seat on the exercise bike mounts completely differently than a standard over the road bicycle seat. This appears to be a nice quality seat, not giving it two stars because it's bad. Hoping that others will check out the low review and not make the same mistake I did."
5,My mistake,I had purchased an A-10 Schwinn stationary bike and the seat is extremely uncomfortable. I thought this seat would be able to replace the existing one but it does not. I will know donate it. I gave this product five stars but truthfully I have no way of knowing how comfortable it might be.
3,Nice and comfortable.,"I love this seat! It really comfortable and wide enough. I had trouble will installation, because the rails underneath were tight and too wide. But once on I think it was worth the hassle."
2,This is worse then the seat that came with my bike,"Well.. I recently purchase a womans schwinn hybrid. The seat that came with it, seemed comfy, until you ride 10+ miles. I am 42 and a little overweight now.. but not too. Plus its all in my upper really. I had just started riding a bike again after about 20 years. Needless to say, I love it so I needed to find a seat, so that I can ride it longer then the 8-10 miles b4 the pain is too much. Well I thought I had done a significant amount of research and was settled on the Schwinn pillow top. It was delievered fast. I put my new seat on as I was anxious to ride further this time. I did notice as I took it out of the box, it was ""ALOT"" shorter then the seat that came with it... a bit wider, but not significantly. Its on, and off I go on my ride.. within 2 miles my rear hurt. I was very disappointed! I would not recommend this seat as a comfy replacement."
1,uncomfortable,I tried to go for the best and i still ended up with sores on my bumbum.There are much more comfortable seats in your local super center. Make sure you test the quality and the material before you buy those. Now it just sits there looking at me reminding me of my mistake. dont buy
5,Saved my rear!,"This bicycle seat is great compared to the standard one that came on my cruiser bike, which caused my booty great discomfort.I was so happy to switch it out for this one. I would not really call this pillow top. It's not that soft, but gives just enough to give you hours on a bike with no sore booty.I would buy it again!"
1,Just what I didn't need,"This item was -- and is still -- being promoted as ""Customers buy this item"" and ""Frequently bought together"" with Schwinn A10 upright bicycles. After spending hours trying to install this seat and sending out several emails asking for instructions, I learned that this seat is NOT suitable and CANNOT be installed on the Schwinn A10 bike, and I had to take the time and trouble to repackage it and mail it back. Frustrated."
1,Extremely uncomfortable,I replaced this seat for the original one on my Schwinn Airdyne. Used it two days and had to go back to the original seat as it was extremely uncomfortable.
2,Smaller than it looks,The Item was received promptly and in good condition. The seat is much narrower than it looks in the picture on my computer screen. I find it difficult to get adjusted and tight enough to stay put with the hardware provided. Perhaps it is intended for those who are not really going to sit on it ... certainly it is out of the way when one is riding standing up and offers a short-term rest while admiring the view. I Installed it on an older Schwinn AirDyne exercise bike. It is much less uncomfortable than the original equipment but not what I'm looking for. I will try again ...
4,Good Seat,I like the seat and how it feels after a long ride. My body does not feel weak nor was the installation hard.
3,Nut came off,"There is a stud for each big spring in the rear. These springs are held to the seat by a nut on the stud. One of these nuts came off (who knows when?). I got the seat in August 2008 and noticed the nut gone Feb 5th (yes I commute on my bike to work through the winter). It dosnt seem to want to accept a new nut - the stud just keeps spinning and it wont tighten up. As ong as the other nut stays there, I guess it still works but... (pun intended)."
3,"Nice Seat, Not a Pillow by Any Definition","I needed a bicycle seat since mine was stolen. I looked at several brands and I decided to go for the Schwinn Pillow Top Cruiser. When I received the seat, I knew right away that it wasn't what I expected. The seat is wider than the one I had, but it wasn't as soft as I thought it would be. It took some time to get used its firmness. I still like this seat much more than the one I had. It's wider seating space is more comfortable. Overall it's a nice, well made seat. It certainly isn't a Pillow Top or anything soft and cushiony if that's what you're expecting. I live in New York City. I never thought anyone would steal a bike seat until my seat was stolen. I also bought a cable lock for my seat for ten bucks. It's was well worth it."
4,it's fine,probably the best seat i could have gotten for the price... although i kind of regret not trying one of the vintage schwinn seats I saw on ebay.....
4,Sweet!,"I am 5'5"" female size 10-12 jeans.I've got a bony big butt. Its a very annoying combination, but after a long bike ride (20 miles) on my old seat, I felt bad in muh bits for a week.I promptly ordered this schwinn seat- super easy to mount and viola- 30 mile ride no pain. My butt feel awesome, the seat looks like its been on a 30 mile ride though- and 30 miles isn't even really long.4 stars for making sitting bareable again.-1 cause its gonna look like I've had it for a decade in a month."
5,schwinn bicycle seat,Schwinn bicycle seat is much more comfortable than the seat that came with our bikes. It has a pillow top and is wider. There are fewer pressure points on a wider seat like this one.
4,Comfortable seat,"Seat is much more comfortable than the stock seat that came with the bike. Able to bike for miles without any discomfort. ""Padded"" in the right places !"
5,Love it ... Good seat,"Good seat. Firm but soft enough. I bought this for a beach cruiser that I ride daily, and it was a HUGE improvement over the previous seat. Go for it."
2,Really hard,"This seat was a nice size, plenty wide at the rear. But it was hard as a rock. Unless you weigh over 200 pounds you can forget about the spring and foam padding. I sent it back."
4,"Decent replacement seat cover for your schwinn, etc.","I recently purchased the schwinn prelude road bike, but the seat was waaay too narrow for my bony rear, so I picked up this one. Easy to install, and will take a few rides until it's properly adjusted. The width is great and doesn't look out of place on a road bike. The pillow top surface is so so, I don't get the ridges at all and you can kind of feel them, but it's just firm enough that you don't feel like you're on a comfort bike. Center support is good, doesn't interfere with the fmily jewels."
1,Completely Uncomfortable,"After installing and testing out this seat I had to come back and double check that I had received the right one, because it certainly did not live up to the good reviews I had read about it. This seat is incredibly uncomfortable, and even with multiple adjustments could barely be ridden on without causing discomfort and pressure points. I will be switching back to the factory default seat that came with my bike, because even that was FAR better than this bicycle seat. I would highly advise against purchasing this seat."
1,This bike seat is total garbage !!! hard as a rock!!!!,"This is by far the most uncomfortable bike seat available anywhere. Do not buy it, do not accept it as a gift, stay as far away from it as humanly possible, at all costs. This is the type of product that would stop people from buying anything on line. It is not what it is advertised to be .It is as hard as a rock!!! total crap!!!"
2,Schwinn Pillow Top Cruiser Bike Seat,"The Schwinn Pillow Top bike seat is not nearly as comfortable as I thought it was going to be. It is too wide and the kind of rubber or materials used do not allow you to move easily on the seat. It grabs your clothes and doesn't move with you. I don't like it at all, but won't spend the money to send it back which is what I really wanted to do.Schwinn Pillow Top Cruiser Bicycle Seat"
5,robert van gulik judge dee murder mystery review,robert van gulik recreates ancient china. as a noted sinologist he makes no silly errors of time and place. the plot is intricate but not contrived and depends on the people as much as the circumstances. it is the easiest form of time travel and reminds us all of what we have in common with chinese of that time. it is a relief to read a story set in ancient china that does not depend on fu manchu theatrics.
4,good product,"But way too expensive, distributors are really capitalizing on what used to be throw away parts of animals. The pricing is way out of hand."
3,OK but not great,"Well, this collection is a bit on the dancey side, less so on the ""song"" side. I guess with all of the remixes I should have realized this. I picked this up to get some songs I knew were good, interesting and hits--but beware. Songs like ""Emerge"" and ""Days Go By"" as remixed heavily and bear little resemblance to what you might want. Frankly the Days Go By mix is boring to boot. And songs that I already had, like The District Sleeps Tonight are the same as the album version. But that's just me: I wanted K-tel, they gave me remixes.There are better snapshots of the dying embers of electroclash and much much better collections of modern technopop songs (Robopop Volume 1 or Electrcity Volume 2 are 2 that come to mind ;-) out there.In the end this set just does not jell, it seems more like an attempt to use left over remixes and a few great tracks (Breathe, District Sleeps Tonight) to move some records. Eh."
2,The best? I think not.,"This disc includes some songs that, while I like them, are not what people might consider the ""best"" of G&S. Of course, anything by G&S is good, it's still not the ""best of the best.""There has got to be something that better represents the G&S canon."
2,Not tall enough to wear outside your jeans,"I bought these boots awhile ago, and while they are cute enough, they aren't exactly what I wanted. I was hoping they would come up to my knee so I could wear them outside my jeans, but they only come up mid-calf - which makes them a little less versatile. The bigger problem with them is that there are edges (or perhaps clear plastic thread) on the insides of both boots that rub against your skin and make your legs raw, if you don't have super long boot socks that come up past the boot. I probably should have just returned them way back when, but too late now!"
2,Single serving butter dish?,"Carefully read the dimensions. I returned mine when I found it was designed to hold one pad of butter. The quality was fine, but at near $70, I couldn't afford a set of 8, much less 12."
5,Excellent Study,Excellent study the women are really enjoying it and learning a lot. If you are looking for a study of women in the Bible this is execellent.
4,Find Inspiration from the Women of the Bible,"This is a workbook styled study of the women of the Bible. Its organized into daily reflections with verses to read and concepts to think about. You cover one woman per week.I was pleasantly surprised, in that it was written by men so I was expecting a particularly subservient bent to it, but it was not. It portrays the women intelligently and gives us enlightening and positive role models.Consider the first woman of the bible. Eve, whose reputation isn't exactly favorable, since she got us kicked out of the Garden. However, the study guide leads you through the positive aspects of that trial and tribulation, and lets you take a away the positive and inspirational contributions Eve made to all of us.I recommend this book for any Woman seeking to further her spiritual self."
4,Wonderful Teaching!,"This book has wonderful authors who thoroughly research and teach each character in this series. I have learned a tremendous amount from this study, but am disappointed that there is very little application in the study. I want to know how to apply these principles in my own life!"
4,Pretty good overall,PROS: Awesome story and very hard to put down.CONS: Sometimes it seemed fake. Their platoon seemed invincible and this guy was superhuman
5,great book,really a good read. the characters are well developed and the story is both exciting and realistically laid out. You can almost smell the mud
5,A story that pulls you in from start to finish.,I was five when my father left to do his first tour of duty in Vietnam. It wasn't until years later that he started telling his stories of the terrible thing he had to do. My brothers and I would hear these stories over and over. My father would have a glazed over look on his face and we would be hanging on every word. When I read this book I once again hung on every word. The format in which the book is written in allows the reader to picture the story so vividly they can feel the sweat running down their foreheades. The best part is that he has a second book out and is writing a third. Pick it up and live the life of a Navy SEAL in the Mekong Delta.
1,No Hero To Me,"The book had interesting content. When I met Gene(Vernon E.Coleman) in Washington, D.C. I received his book, personnally. It is too bad that this man does not have the same courage he portrays in his book. His decorations are just that. decorations. He may have been a real Seal, but there is no Honor in lying and manipulating innocent people. That is what Gene Wentz does best. Enjoy the book for it's thirst for the hero, but remember, Heros are people you look up to and respect. Gene Wentz is no hero to me. He lies and uses religon to excuse the behaviors he displays, his book is testomonial to his beliefs in lying and religon.I realize most readers have an interest in the Navy Seals. I did not have any knowledge of Seals until Gene introduced me to his ""Playground"". I found it intrieging but I soon learned to fear this man and his behavior."
4,"One of the best, classic Vietnam Seal stories.","I was hooked the moment I started reading. Factual action, what a ride!Gene Wentz has a exllent easy flowing writing style.I highly recommend reading ""Men in Green Faces"""
4,Great SEAL mission accounts,"I bought this book after being referred to it by the author of No Easy Day. It follows Gene and his team throughout his tour in Vietnam. You get to know all the members of the team, and it's very gripping."
1,Wrong CD sent.,"I ordered a CD by a San Francisco (Bay Area) rap group named I.M.P., I was very excited about purchasing the CD. However, I didn't get the CD I purchased. I called the vendor and they explained to me that they didn't even have that CD in stock. Why post an item you don't even have in stock!? I was very upset about the issue. I still have not recieved my refund."
5,back in the days,"STR8 FIRE-gangsta beats & flowz ta the fullest for tha nine-tre...definetly essential rap outta hunters point C-FRESH & COUGNUT(R.I.P.)spit that og game...feat.cellski,dre-dog,totally insane & black-c of r.b.l. posse...dont sleep"
2,Mariah fanatics only!,"Even Mariah fans might be hard-pressed to listen to this entire cd without skipping a track. You definitely miss the vocals on an instrumental version of a Mariah Carey song, but what is so sorely missing on this cd are new and exciting arrangements of the music itself! I was expecting some new takes on old favorites - something interesting, but all I got were water-down, karaoke-lite instrumental versions of great songs with little to no interesting instrumentation or musicianship."
3,Good Just the Same,"I ordered this book thinking it was more of a psychological breakdown of sex and what it means to each individual or what certain behavior says about a person based on their sexual preferences and wants. I however got a book that was very preachy, specially on the subject of celibacy which i have zero intent on practicing. I did however learn new things and took alot of knowledge from it. It was at times a bit redundant and it got somewhat boring. I did finish it and i wouldnt say it was disappointing but it wasnt exactly what i was looking for. It was OK."
3,Provoking,"I find any of Osho's works on sex very provoking. He really challenges my sexual views as well as those of our western society. I may not agree with all that he has to say about sex but he sure does make me think about our perceptions of sex. He has a very liberal view of sex. No, in actual fact that is not true! He sees sex as just another part of the human condition. It is our western world that has given it an arena all of its own and it is our own unresolved issues about sex that has created our obsession with it. Well worth reading!Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings"
5,Pathbreaking work,"To me, it was enlightening. OSHO is one of the greatest mystic and deals with everything with excellent logic and scientific attitude. No prejudice and old beliefs. It starts from scratch discussing about sex-energy and how to use and transform into a greater reality....love and meditation.A treat to the reader. Specially, I think every traditional people and old religion like hinudism, jainism, mohammedanism, christianity should read it atleast once."
5,Historical,"Especially for European fans like myself, who don't know the history of American grand prix drivers and cars, this is an execelent book. I've just loved it. Five stars, at least."
5,Bird's of Oklahoma Field Guide,I like the book because it has close up actual pictures and good descriptions of the birds which is vital in identifying them. So far I have found all the birds I've been looking for. I also like the size of the book. It's better than the Audubon Society's version of the book.
2,Workbook that lacks research foundation,"This is the only book I ever returned to Amazon.com. I am following the program outlined in Kathleen DesMaison's ""Sugar Addict's Total Recovery Program,"" and was looking for additional information/inspiration about overcoming sugar addiction.If I had known it was a lock-step workbook that lacks a solid research foundation, I never would have ordered it."
4,Very detailed,"Bought it for my son--no interest. Very detailed, nope would not buy again unless I, as an adult, was interested in seashells."
5,Great Read,"If you enjoyed Rice's Sir Richard Burton, you will enjoy this book. It a fun read for a airplane ride. Kryza weaves an excellent tale in the search for the mythical city. You feel the stress and challenges of the early 19th century African explorers and marvel that the human body could accomplish the feat of these individuals under those circumstance. It is worth the price because it takes you back in time to a period where individual performance is truly measured."
5,awesome salsa steps and great teacher.,"i am just wondering why the first reviewer of these series made an insinuation that the reviewers for these videos were fabricated. that reviewer i suspect did not even buy this product nor watched it, i bet that person do not even know how to dance. i have a lot of salsa videos and most of them are terrible especially those made by those ballroom dance studios. these particular series made by salsacrazy is i think one if not the best instructional videos in the market today. the steps are awesome and the teacher really breaks down the steps that even a caveman can follow. this 3 pack set is worth its price rather than buy those other salsa videos that are hard to follow because of poor quality instructors. thanks to all the reviewers who gave these series grade A and 5 stars which helped me decide to try this product and i did not make a wrong decision by following the first unfair reviewer."
2,Basic Fundimental Book,"There is nothing ""ultimate"" about this basketball shooting book. Filled with lots of pictures and fundimental instruction that is in most every basketball book on the market. Certainly not up to the hype."
1,No!!!,This is not a good product for my body... and I will be sending it back and requesting my money back!!!
3,Yoga DVD,"I wouldn't classify this DVD for beginners, the instructor moves through each of the moves very quickly making it very difficult to keep up. With you trying to mimick her moves it is even more difficult. I think a video with the moves broken down and repeated would be much more beneficial"
4,Great service!,A nice selection for the novice to the experienced yogi. The location is beautiful and very zen. It's a great dvd for strengthening your body and getting a good stretch.
4,Yoga For Weight Loss for Beginners,Came quickly and packaged well. Just starting using it. It seems easy to follow. Let you know in a few weeks.
3,Yogo,Brought for my daughter. I heard her says she liked it. I have not tried it. I don't like the requirement of number of words to this review.
2,NOt really for beginners,"I have done a few dvd yoga work outs in the past month, and this one is one of the worst. She does not show any modified poses, kind of explains them but not well. If you are a beginner I would not recomend this at all! It is only her doing a talk over and the poses.. there are no other people for critics or anything else. not worth the money there are many other dvds out there and even youtube videos that are much better"
5,Perfect segments,"I don't have time for an hour yoga session in the morning. This DVD fits perfectly into my schedule with 6 minute, 9 minute, and 30 minute segments."
5,Really Like This,"Really good way to get into yoga and lose weight and tone up. Some easier things to work with to start, then gradually takes you further and further. Depending on your shape or if some yoga experience, the first may be a bit easier for you, but still worth it to get a bit grounded if you need it. You can skip to some of the more challenging ones, but when I did that, I realized going back a bit to learn and have a good base definately helped. Plus even the easier ones started showing results in flexlibility and starting to tone up. Nice."
5,Great Beginng Yoga To Workout With,"I have been doing Pilates for awhile now and wanted to add Yoga to the mix to help get in shape. (Actually my wife mentioned adding it since I liked her Pilates recommenndations.)This has been a good addition. Some moves are broken down clearly at the beginning to get you familiar with them, then more routines follow that are paced well and I was able to keep up with them after a little bit of practice.Maggie provides good cueing and the longer routines provide a good workout that you feel. It is not a cardio or sweating type workout (though I do sweat a bit) but more of a focused flow on the muscles and the weights add some more toning."
3,Decent,Pros first: She does a really good job explaining each pose and the proper alignment. Poses are held a decently long time so you do feel a good burn.Cons: Kind of boring. There is no music and no ups and downs to the routine. It is literally switching from one pose to the next as she calmly describes it. She was kind of putting me to sleep as opposed to energizing me.
5,Good Workout To Reach My Goals,"I am in okay shape, but not great shape, and somewhat overweight. I wanted to start working out, but found some workouts I had tried were too difficult, so I decided to try this one and it has been a good choice.The lessons to start with are perfect to start moving and working out and I felt like I was getting exercise without beating myself up. The teacher is guiding and brings you along well without I started feeling better and feeling more energetic after doing this for a bit and started losing some weight. Nice beach setting with music that is not annoying like on some DVDs. It is a real good selection for me and what I needed to do."
2,"Okay, but other videos are better","I never enjoyed using this video workout. I told myself to give it a try and over time I would become less frustrated, but my frustration only increased.I didn't like the cueing, or the way the instructor tells you what to do next, in this video. She didn't differentiate between ""back"" meaning ""behind you"" and ""back"" meaning ""to its original position."" So, ""move your foot back"" could mean a couple of different things at different times.By the time I got the hang of the flow, and knew what she wanted me to do, the more I followed the instructions, the more I experienced pain in the arches of my feet and my ankles.The locale is pretty and the first beginner workout is not too bad, if you're an absolute beginner to yoga, recovering from illness or injury. but the chair business confused me and I almost bonked my head on it a few times.I wouldn't recommend this video to anyone."
2,No sense of inner peace from these workouts,"I have numerous Yoga DVD's which I alternate to keep myself from getting bored with one routine. Often in the morning I will do a short routine before work to get my day off to a great start. I have found that most of the workouts have one thing in common - a tremendous sense of ""inner peace"" upon completion of the routine, no matter how short it is. [...] the poses are done too quickly, with little focus on breathing and awareness of self. [...]"
1,Not impressed - at all.,"I was looking forward to this video since I read good reviews on it but once I started watching it I was disappointed. First of all, the video just drags big time. I do realize there is alot of breathing & relaxation involved in yoga - I've taken classes in the past by different trainers at two different gyms. Then, the person in the video doing the routines isn't even the instructor/person talking which I thought was lame for some reason. And this video was just all over the place. It had so many levels to choose from but they all ended up being the same poses - I didn't get it. Lastly, I don't know what was going on with the audio when your on the main menu screen - it sounded like there was something wrong with my television. Just annoying all the way around."
3,DVD stops and skips,"I think I would like this DVD but in certain areas it skips and sometimes it completely stops. I have tried cleaning it, but nothing has helped. I don't know the amazon return/replacement policy."
1,Useless,"Wow, I was really disappointed when I watched the DVD. It feels home made. I am not sure why they put on there for beginners, its just one really boring and monotone voice telling you what to do while she is doing it. Telling you to stretch certain muscels, but not where they are and how. After each if you want to call it ""exercise"" the whole thing gets cut off and they try to sell you their DVD: Yoga for inflexible people, by just showing the DVD, the whole thing gets interrupted by it. It just comes up very unprofessional and I am very disappointed. Yes, it was cheap but I did expect more."
1,Not for starters,I hate this dvd! It is not for first timers. It's way to hard if you never done any yoga before. There is no teaching on how to do the moves.
4,it's cool,it might be helpful for someone. but for me I didn't see any change. Maybe because I am bad at persisting
2,Isn't yoga supposed to be relaxing?,So much for 'stress relief'- the lady who does this video is all over the place- like three poses every 5 seconds. Not for beginners that for sure.
3,Not for beginners,This dvd is not for beginners> The video goes straight into poses and they change fast without any explanation at all. I have not done yoga in 2 years and had a hard time keeping up with it.
2,Disappointment,I was very disappointed in this video. I thought it would have instructions on how to do the various position of yoga but it didn't. One is left to figure it out on their own.
4,good video,"This is a good video; there is quite a bit of repetition and way too much of the down dog pose. However, I enjoyed the routines generally and really liked the scenery."
2,This gives yoga a bad name,"Boring!!! Repetitive moves and the woman has an excruciatingly annoying voice. As unchallenging as it is I don't think this should be labeled for weight loss. I can't see how this would possibly burn enough calories!!! Believe me that yoga can definately do that, just not this one.2 things that are positive are there many different workouts to choose from. Adjustable times are nice. Also, there is 1 workout in the strength section the 30 minute full body with weights....that one is actually a very good workout."
1,Yoga For Weight Loss for Beginners,"Not for beginners who are overweight. Too many aspect changes, i.e. on the floor, on your knees, upright. No modifications for people who have difficulty with a position. Even the warm up section was difficult. I was very disappointed with this program."
1,Easy Yoga,"I am only 39 years old and have a bad hip, which I'm trying not to have surgery on. My doctor told me to to some yoga, and this DVD is so easy to do. Usually my hip hurts after trying to exercise, but not this time. But don't just take my word for it, TRY IT."
3,Not the greatest for true beginners,"This is my first experience with yoga at all. Therefore, I thought it would be appropriate for me since it says it's for beginners. But I find it to move too quickly. I'm often still thinking about the last instruction while she's already moved on to the next one.That said, I do think with a bit of yoga experience this could be good. Maybe it's more for ""advanced beginners"". Not total newbies, but you don't need to be a master to use it.I'm going to take a true yoga for beginners class locally and hope that once I am more familiar with the concepts, this DVD will be of better use to me."
2,Not For Beginners,"I got this DVD so that I could explore whether Yoga was something that I would enjoy and that would be helpful to me. It was well-reviewed, and there were copious references to how beautiful the scenery and music are. that said, YES, it is shot in a lovely locale, but I did not find the music relaxing OR beautiful. Didn't seem ""yoga like"" to me. Now, the meat of the matter, if one has never tried yoga, this is NOT the DVD to choose. There seems to be sort of an unspoken understanding that one knows about ""mountain"" position or ""dog"" position, or that one can easily balance on one foot while the other leg is bent. HELLLLLLOOOOO, this is NOT beginner stuff. This may be a great DVD and might be helpful to many, but I advise against it for true beginners like me. I will give it away to someone else who has a bit more knowledge, experience and ""know how"" for it. Beginners...............Beware."
3,Ok but a little fast-paced,I got this as a replacement for my old Weight Loss Yoga dvd as that one got scratched. This one is a little more fast paced and you do end up sweating which is cool if you want that. I liked my old dvd but this is a good alternative.
1,Not for beginners!,"I am not totally out of shape, working out at the gym several days a week, but I know I'm not too flexible, so I thought a DVD that says ""beginners"" would be a good place to start with yoga. I got about halfway through it, just laughing, because it was both so hard to follow and surely impossible for most real beginners. You're supposed to stand balanced with one foot pressed into the other upper thigh? I can't even lift my foot that high, let alone stand on one leg with it there. This may be a fine yoga video but calling it for beginners is crazy."
3,Can't really remember,"I bought this so long ago. I remember watching it........a few times. It was interesting, I think. I can't say that I actually moved though. Shame."
3,Just like any other Yoga video,"This video is OK but it doesn't stand out from most other Yoga videos in any way. It's just another ""go through the motions"" boring Yoga video."
3,Yoga DVD,I received my video quickly and I am satisfied with the condition of the product. The content itself is a tad bit disappointing because it isn't as versatile in routines as I had expected.
1,"Omg, is my DVD on a Loop","Omg, is my DVD on a loop! I have been looking for a good Flow Yoga DVD, one that I can do in the morning to prepare for my day and just relax. I bought this DVD for 2 reasons, it was a yoga DVD and I wanted something that would help me tone and lose weight. When I started the DVD I was like okay a lot of sections so I'm thinking a lot of different Yoga moves. It appears that they only focus on Sun Salutations and Minor Warrior poses on every section. I am so bored with this DVD it is ridiculous."
5,Yoga For Weight Loss for Beginners,I am enjoying the work out provided with this video. Fun and not to hard for a beginner. But it is challenging enough to keep interest level up
5,So Good,"I like the approach to yoga shown in this video, it does not expect you to know everything or be in good shape right off the bat, and allows for that by some easy things to start off with.More than enough to get started with then takes it further through two more levels with some neat things later that really help tone."
4,Good for all ages & skill levels,"I love this DVD. My mom can use it. I can use it. I can do harder moves or easier ones. And I don't feel stuck following along to a particular routine. This is a great DVD even for people familiar with yoga, because the narrator talks along and describes the reason and need for the moves. For example, Mountain Pose... I have never had a yoga teacher who carried me through the pose with such explaination. I found that very helpful, soothing... and later when I went into Mountain Pose, I was thinking of her earlier descriptions.I only wish the DVD lasted longer and had more options. It seemed a bit short."
5,Really Works,"I have not done a lot of yoga before, but now I'm hooked.This DVD is fantastic. It has two levels of workouts (and each level has a few workouts) - one level is for beginners and one has some more challenging poses once you are comfortable with the first level.There is also a third section (again with a few workouts) that incorporates weights and/or a resistance band into the workout.Not only have I lost some weight and am closer to touching my toes easily, but I have really toned up from this DVD. I would have called this DVD, ""Yoga for Getting in Shape"" Highly recommended."
5,Great Variations,"I loved Maggie's other Yoga DVD and purchased this one also. Though I am still working through both DVDs, this one has some great variations in addition to the sections geared more towarda beginners.The sections with the bands and weights definately help to make the routines target for toning.Good DVD for learning and also to help tone you in a different way."
2,Great for brand new to yoga,"This DVD is perfect if you are trying yoga for the first time and need to learn the basics. Even for the intermediate level on the dvd a beginner would be fine. I have not been doing yoga for that long, maybe two or three months. I take classes at my gym. I just found this to be very uninspiring and not very challenging. Like I said before if you are brand new to yoga and want to try it, this would be a good start to learn the basics. There were a lot of downward dog and cobra poses. I think the most challenging thing it went to was Warrior 1 & 2 poses. Some might like this dvd and its simplicity but it is not for me unfortunately."
5,Excellent review,"The item shipped within a timely manner. In my opinion, the video goes a little fast for a beginner. Scenery is relaxing."
5,I liked it so much I emailed the author!,"This is an excellent book! It is easy to read, easy to understand, and easy to implement. Any counselor who is working or plans to work with middle or high school kids MUST have this book."
5,Great Book for Teachers and Counselors,"Murphy gives great tips and strategies for working with students in middle and high schools. The book is clear and crisp, and it should make wonderful addition to the bookshelf of anyone who works with students in secondary schools."
5,A Wonderful Overview,This is the very first book I read on Buddhism. I found it very helpful in giving a complete overview of the Buddhist spiritual path. I recommend it for anyone who wants a concise explanation of Buddhism.
5,"Excellent, outstanding synopsis of the Buddhist Path",I have read this book several times and even bought copies for friends. It is an excellent resource with very good insights into Buddhist thought and philosophy. I recommend this book!
2,Not for the philosopher,"I bought ""Introduction to Buddhism"" expecting to get an introduction to the Classical Buddha's teachings. This book is not that. If you are looking for an introduction to the PHILOSOPHY of Classical Buddhism,as I was, this book is not for you. After taking an introduction to Classical Buddhism class, I realized how far off this book is from providing the Philosophy of Classical Buddhism. I found what I was looking for in the book ""What The Buddha Taught"" by Walpola Rahula. It is a introduction to classical Buddhism and the Buddha's teachings on the Four Noble Truth. ""What the Buddha Taught"" provides reasoning and arguments that are sound, unlike ""Introduction to Buddhism"". ""Introduction to Buddhism"" just tells you a certain belief without the reasoning as to why the Buddha believed this. After all, Gautama the Buddha (the original Buddha) was a philosopher spreading his views on what he believed to be the truth."
2,meh,was okay but a little too sect specific for me at the end of the day. was and still am more of a generalist for this...
2,Limited Perspective,"With all deference to the teachings of Geshe Kelsang Gyatso, some good, basic information is found here but the details are narrowly focused on a particular sect of tantric Tibetan Buddhism. Like all of the world's wisdom traditions, Buddhism began rather simply and evolved as it touched, influenced and was, in turn, influenced and colored by the customs and cultures it encountered. One might have hoped for a more expansive discussion of the evolution of Buddhist thought and teachings such as may be found in the excellent books by Dr. Huston SmithBuddhism: A Concise Introductionand Walpola RahulaWhat the Buddha Taught: Revised and Expanded Edition with Texts from Suttas and Dhammapada. Both of these books, in my opinion, are superior ""beginning Buddhism"" texts."
2,Intro to Buddhism: Explanation of Buddhist way of Life.,"Not exactly what I expected. Not generalized. Into a very defined method of Buddhism, of which there are many methods."
1,Only book I have ever tossed after the first page,"By the cover it looked okay. In the second paragraphe I came across the worst similie I have seen in all my years. I tossed the book in the trash. Unfortunatly, I didn't empty the trash right away. My eyes crossed the cover when I was tossing something else and I became enraged that such (junk) could be published. So I picked it up again. I wouldn't be fair to write a review based on only the first two paragraphes, there are alot of bad writers who are, nevertheless good story teller ( edger rich burroughs, ludlum, grissom, etc. )I gave it another thirty pages and wanted to tear me eyes out and slash my wrists. Enjoy"
5,CLassic,"how could he? well he did.he made his greatest FINALLY on cd.it is actually his first 3 albums which were only on tapes, so now you know what he means when he says Album Numer 10. tighest rappers always deserve greatest hits and too $hort has deserved it.basically what i am saying is that you should buy this if you like classic Too $hort"
1,"THIS ISN'T A REVIEW, IT'S A QUESTION","I was just listening to the 30: sample of short side, and b**wjob betty, and they both sound EXACTLY the same. Does anyone know if the b**wjob betty on the Greatest Hits is the same one as on his Get In Where You Fit In album???"
1,HOW COULD HE,HOW COULD HE. THIS IS THE WORST CD I HAVE EVER HEARD . TOO SHORT IS TOO WEAK. HE SHOULD HOOK UP WITH PEANUT BUTTER WOLF AND THE BACK STREET BOYS. AFTER ALL ......... YOU CANT TEACH AN OLD DOG NEW TRICKS. GARBO!EDWAHH
3,Pretty good weight loss plan for guys,"I used this diet for a while and enjoyed steady healthy lost weight loss (about 25 pounds) while on it. It is a fairly simple plan, however eventually counting calories became a nuisance and did not fit well into my normal routine. However, this book still has a good bit of information on healthy lifestyles and healthy eating, and is written from a guys perspective, in a very to-the-point manner. If you respond well to low-fat diets, and have the willpower to monitor caloric intake, this plan should work, and the book is a good read. I have revised my review to 3 stars (from the original 5) because it turned out to be impractical for me in the long run."
3,"Works well when installed, but it won't come off.","I installed the dual off camera ettl2 flash synch cord on a Canon 30D with two flashes mounted on a dual arm macro bracket. It was a bit heavy with all the gear, but the setup produced beautiful results. The problem is a small ""locking"" wire extending from the bottom of the connector becomes lodged in a threaded hole on the hotshoe. The connector will not come off. I even took it to a Canon factory authorized repair facility and they had to break the connector to remove it. If you don't mind a permanent setup, then this may work for you."
1,"""Don't Put That In Your Mouth -- You Don't Know Where It's Been""","Not all versions of the Zohar are the same, and this one is of unknown provenance. Who knows where this ""publisher"" got what it claims to be the Zohar text? Who can vouch for the text's accuracy and reliability as the actual words of the Zohar (without scribal or typographical errors)?Contrast this situation with the work behind ""The Zohar, Pritzker Edition,"" a translation that not only is supervised by the world's leading academic scholars of the Zohar, but also is based on a careful collation of the best manuscripts, early editions, and commentaries. And that scientifically edited Aramaic text is available for FREE download from the Web site of the publisher, Stanford University Press."
5,"Great CD, with the original texts!","Zohar is a Hebrew word that means splendor. In its simplest form, the Zohar is a commentary on the Bible, structured as conversations among a group of friends, scholars, and spiritual masters. Although the wisdom available in its pages is older than Creation itself, the text of the Zohar was composed more than 2000 years ago. It was then that the great Kabbalist Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai revealed the Zohar to his student, Rabbi Abba who transcribed it in the ancient language of Aramaic. In the centuries that followed, the Zohar was often suppressed by religious and secular authorities who feared its power to transform the lives of those who gained access to the sacred writings. The sages of Kabbalah, too, realized that the Zohar must wait until humankind was ready to receive it."
5,a great interpretation of the oringals,"Heard some of this on an internet radio station a few years back - bought the CD in 05, still enjoy it very much. Felt it was a wonderful job done on the recreation of Zeppelins music."
3,OK CD,"If you are into this genre, it is a good CD. If you are in to Led Zeppelin, buy a Led Zeppelin CD."
1,Suck Eggs,This is the worst *****ing music I've ever heard! Youve ruined The Real Led Zepplin by adding in Red neck Music. Yee haaa.
5,refeshing music,"I am a true die hard fan of led zepplin, to me there is no bad song by the band led zepplin all of there music is good. Pickin on led zepplin is so refeshing and realling gets my foot stoppin and groovin to the music.I often wonder if John was still alive what kind of music the band would be making. thanks"
3,It's good for descriptions and definitions,"I don't regret getting this book, but I have seen better. The illustrations are a good source but not an ideal one. I did notice, and maybe it's just me, that the drawings were not proportional and a little too cartoony (it's definately a personal preference). However the garments themselves are nicely drawn and will be helpful to me in the future."
5,Excellent as ever,"My mother bought a Mirro Pressure Cooker in 1957 and it lasts until 1980.When I bought my first 6-Quart Pressure Cooker it was 1981, and it last until 1995 because I made a mistake changing a part.Now I got a 12-Quart Pressure cooker.It is less strong than the old models, but much more sure and easy to use.As usual foods keep their flavor and color.It is fallowed into the future by those American, Spaniard and Brazilian brands.It was a good acquisition.Delivering time pretty good."
1,very disappointed,"i ordered a wearever 12 qt. pressure cooker and received another brand. i contacted the seller and they were just as confused as i was. therefore, i had to return the item to my dismay."
3,"Good techniques, poor photography.",It is a good demonstration of techniques that you can use. it would have probably received a five star if the photography was professionally done.
5,Effective No Frills Instruction,"While it's not fancy or flashy, this dvd provides clear instruction on techniques and more importantly on the principles that make the techniques work. Great for new rookies or for veterans who need a refresher."
5,Resolution to the Age-Old Conflict Between the Bible and Modern Science,"This book is a fantastic resolution of the age-old conflict regarding the theories of evolution. The author has thoroughly dissected and fully supported their view by both Science and the Bible, explaining what others have failed to see, that there is Biblical support for the notion that the earth is billions of years old.This dissertation, based on Biblical interpretation of scripture, will leave you in awe, satisfy the questions that have plagued man concerning the perceived controversy between Science and the Religious world, and empower to see oneself in a totally different light. I am so glad I have read this book! You will be, too."
5,The Missing Link,"Do you have questions about the creation, and how we as humans were created and why, then this is the book for you, this book answered all the questions I had on how creation begin and how I fit into the big picture, great book."
5,Replacement fuel pump,"Bought this fuel pump to replace the standard Yanmar fuel pump that came with their 20 hp engine. We manufacture generators, so I go through 12 engines a month, and I had all kinds of issues with the standard pump. After I replaced them with this one, no problems! This is a great pump and I would highly recommend that if you're looking around for one, you pick up this one. I will be using the Beck Arnley brand in the future because of this."
5,So cute!,Love the military-styled jacket for the young 'ens who want to look tough when they play soldiers with their friends and brothers. This was a hit at Christmas time.
1,"Useful, assuming it stays together long enough to use it","It's printed in India. This means the paper isn't what you're expecting, in addition the ink sometimes bleeds through. As if that isn't enough, some of the pages just simply fall out of the book. Add to that the fact that the font myseriously changes halfway through the Hindi section, and you have yourself a rather unprofessional attempt at a dictonary."
5,A staple of my diet,"I'm addicted to these. I go through two a day--sometimes more--and I buy them by the boxful for safekeeping in my office at work. I take them on trips (can't leave home without them!). I keep some at home in case of another New York City blackout. Most of the NuGo bar flavors are delicious, particularly Coffee, but Chocolate Banana is the most nutritious and highest in protein with no compensating loss of flavor."
2,Not fresh,"I love Nugo Bars and when Costco stopped carrying them, I turned to Amazon. I was intrigued by the Chocolate Banana flavor and ordered them along with the Vanilla Yogurt Nugo bars. The Chocholate Banana were very hard and difficult to eat. They also have a very banana flavor, somewhat artificial tasting. I will not be ordering anymore of this flavor."
4,"High Nutrition , Low Sugar",This nutrition bar has the highest protein content. The banana taste a bit strange. But overall it is a good product
2,Elevator Phishin',"The album contains 12 songs, 4 from each of 3 different studio albums (Story of the Ghost, Picture of Nectar, and Rift). It is my guess the folks responsible for this record caught wind of the phenomenon that is Phish, bought these 3 records randomly not knowing much about the band, picked the 4 songs from each that they felt that they could pull off, and proceeded to make this album with the intent of making a few bucks.The music is good at times, but usually falls flat. I was hoping for at least a little jamming in the vein of Phish, but none is to be found (each song clocks in at around 3-4 minutes).This record is a fun novelty at times, but usually comes off sounding like Phish elevator music."
3,If you are already a fan...,"The bluegrass influences on Phish are made evident, but without the lyrics some songs get repetitive. The group uses the fiddle for most of the vocals (with a very nicely done mix of guitar and fiddle on Rift to represent Mike and Trey singing the alternate verses). This is a fiddle, not a violin, however, and on Tweezer it gets strident enough that I skipped it on several play throughs. There are three songs each from Picture of Nectar, Rift, and Story of the Ghost. Perhaps the cover band had a limited cd collection. This is produced by a company that does bluegrass tributes to lots of bands, but as a Phan it was phun to hear a different interpretation of songs I know by heart. If you don't know Phish it's just some pretty music with an occasionally annoying violin."
4,"beautiful, but lack of jam","this tribute shows phish as well as bluegrass music alot of well deserved respect. the first time i listen to ""gone phishin'""--no wait lets just break it down to ""velvet sea""--i mean the opening was just beautiful, you could see right where they were going with it (not that its a bad thing) when the lyrics started playing i started singing them, and i sang right along with it--it was perfect, my only problem was that they just didn't jam it out long enough, ya know, once the lyrics were over, the song was over, i wish they would have put a little more bluegrass in there instead of cutting each song so short, but every song on the c.d. was played perfect, just like velvet sea. all in all the various artists that concocted this c.d. are very gifted and talented, i guess that's why i wish so much they would have played more music, because i know the potential they have."
4,Bluegrass Musicians Interpret Trey and the Boys,"This is an interesting disc and if you are fond of the newgrass explosion or just good old fashioned pickin' you will most likely dig it. My only complaint is the song selection. Although all of the songs are good, they represent only three albums(Picture of Nectar, Billy Breathes, and Story of the Ghost). For fans that only like Phish's hardcore seering rips, Gone Phishin' may be a little soft. The slow playing is beautiful, although it does not pack the punch of even a Phish studio album. There are no vocals, but the fiddle fills in very well(check out Wading in the Velvet Sea). Overall, although it lacks the real jams followers of Phish have come to expect, this is a beautifully played album and if you are a dedicated Phan with any interest in bluegrass it's definitely worth having."
3,It's pretty much that,"I can't quibble with any of the four previously posted reviews. If you're expecting something revolutionary or revelationary, you're probably not going to find it on this release. If you can dig instrumental bluegrass and can groove on sort of ""easy listening"" versions of Phish tunes (such as a strummed banjo in place of lyircs), then you probably will enjoy this for a number of listens. Regardless, it does make for pleasant background music. And the cover strikes me as remarkably original - even if the music isn't particularly."
1,easy listening,"The exitement of giving this cd to my husband, a phish fan for over 10 years, was crushed as soon as we played the first couple of songs. At the end, we gave it to my in-laws who thought it was ""nice"" backgroud music.unless your into easy listening, save your money."
2,elevator music,"I am a big phish phan. I like just about all of their stuff. Phish is known for there long, great jams. You won't find that on this cd. To me it sounds like the group that did this didn't show enough respect for Phish. All the songs are about four minutes long, and just basically boring."
4,Phish + Bluegrass = 4 Stars,"If when you think of bluegrass music you think of The Ballad of Jed Clampet this album is a great way to get away from that. If you are looking for a Phish album with a really distinct and different sound then I highly recommend it. Keep in mind that this album is all instrumental, there are no drums and there is no 20 minute version of Cavern. This is not a CD that I will have in heavy rotation but it will be nice to play it once in a while."
2,Read with an open mind...,"I just finished reading this book, and I couldn't put it down. It wasn't because it was a great book, but I was just so interested in his flawed point of view. If you read this book, please do so w/ an open mind. His tips should not be taken to heart by any woman. He says the book isn't male bashing, but it surely bashes the women he claims to have written the book before. To make a book and explain categories of men, and then their subcategories, and also personailty traits that can be found in any man is ridiculous. You cannot group men and expect to all of a sudden find Mr. Right. The most valuable advice in the book is to go out and live life and have you own experiences. If women do that, instead of reading this book, I believe they'll be alot better off. You don't need someone (a man) to tell you what kind of men are out there if you're living life. Especially (as someone already mentioned) a man who has friends that have orgies in his apartment."
1,"this book is whack, G","Hmmm. I rented this book from the library after seeing so many positive 5 star reviews. I have been hearing a lot about authors, family and friends pushing books with 5 star reviews and publishers offering percs. If k-flex has any good insights about dating and relationships, he does not present them well. To start off this book is filled with out-dated ebonic phrases from the early nineties; that part is pretty funny. In fact the whole book is written in old skool ebonics dialect and over all very cable tv nineties cliched. He breaks down women from a man's point of view into six catergories from hot woman with game to ugly woman with no game. There is a quiz to check if ""you are a chickenhead.""If you are after a self help guide for relationships do not bother with this book."
1,"disgusting, misogynistic","The current plague of books written by black men who are openly proud of having been pimps, as well as those who appear on ""talk"" shows to brag about being pimps are a shocking disgrace and an utterly sickening insult to the memories of those black women and men who risked/gave their lives during the civil rights wars of the 60's so that future generations of black kids could live in dignity and with pride and power. As for this book, some of the ""good advice"" is that any woman who is not ""beautiful"" will be forced to support herself the rest of her life, as no man will want to take care of her. But she should not fear,he soothes: ""you can put a gorilla in a thong and some guy will buy it a drink"". And downward from there, with less than 2% of common sense words of Oprah-like wisdom found in most women's self help dating books. One more for the shredder."
1,Hate It,This book is sexist. He's goes so far as to say that women who are independent and don't depend on men do so because they can't get a man to take care of them. He also says that a man has to keep his woman in check....Uh No this book was a waste of time.
1,Grow Up People,"I have read this book and I think this book and others like this one are pure garbage. No one man can predict what other men are thinking about women. Mr. Nasheed has not been with every woman in the world to make these generalized statements. Any woman who reads these sort of ""how to find a man"" books is truly sad. Work within yourself to find what factors are preventing you from finding true happiness with the opposite sex. There are no magic answers to finding a man, when it's meant to be it just ""happens"". So what if a woman wears blue and pink weaves, does that mean that she does not deserve happiness? She may just be showcasing her creative side. It may not be my personal taste but it doesn't make her any less a person who deserves love. But I will say that the book was entertaining at best, there were parts that were truly funny."
2,Book Does Not Deliver as Advertised,"Good writing. Humorous. Interesting points and views. Unfortunately, the book did not necessarily provide for me what the summary and/or customer reviews on Amazon promised. Nasheed categorizes males and females in a variety of ways and offers notable insight into the state of black relationships, but this isn't the instructional manual that I hoped to find."
3,"If you're totally lost, then yes it's a good choice...","While there is a lot of slang that may not appeal to everyone, this book is quite an honest account of tips on what to do and not do in life. I think in many ways the author is attempting to teach basic skills of confidence and self-sufficiency to women. While the advice seems pretty basic, I think there are still a lot of women that would find it helpful, as they get lost in the complicated world of modern dating. I am ok and enjoyed the dialectical tone used to convey the message. However, some may be put off by it.Where it may fall short is in the actual examples of what to do and what not to do. The obvious things are covered. But once you have made yourself an ""a"" class woman, what then? That one is not always as straight forward. I certainly know tons of A class women who have had a hard time of it. While the author hints that patience is key, I think further elaboration could have been beneficial."
3,This Is Good To Know The Games That Are Out There....,But Black women have to take it one step further and expand their options to include all races...Author OfBlack Women Deserve Better
2,Laugh out loud reading,"Read this book for its entertainment value rather than for its intellectual content, especially because it has none. Nasheed's book is filled with so much generalizations and stereotypes about men,women and their views on relationships. The advice he offers seem nothing more than rhetoric re-worded in hip language.However it was great bathroom reading and has its laugh out loud moments."
2,based largely on stereotypes,"This book is hilarious. Tariq ""K-Flex"" Nasheed makes a lot of good points, but I wouldn't take all of his ""tips"" and ""rules"" to heart. His writing style delivers his black-and-white philosophies under the guise of fact. But I still enjoyed it. You should read it for its comedic value."
1,"He might be an ""ex-pimp"" but he's still a misogynist and sexist","Do not buy this book unless you want to be insulted. This book is based on the baseless opinions, ridiculous generalities and the WORST of gender stereotypes. He argues that ""women are not born to be leaders"" and ""women are emotional thinkers."" This book is inane, illogical and downright offensive to any women or girls who respect themselves. Quite frankly, I am angered that anyone even published this book."
2,Bigger than a boxcar,"Order 3 packs of the Jockey Briefs and they arrived within a reasonable time. Open one pack and the briefs - size M for 32-34 waist - were extremely large. Someone with a 38"" waist with a very high rise could wear these.Called Jockey and was advised to wash in hot water and dry on hot - are you serious?? They offered to have me return them but why should I have to find something to mail them in and drive more than 20 miles one way for the mailing?? Jockey could have done a UPS will call pickup.Not a very good company to do business with. If your stomach hangs over your belt by several inches - these may be what you need. Just remember the sizing is way off and the rise is very high - like armpit high!"
5,I don't need Munsingwear anymore,"I have used the Munsingwear for years because of the kangaroo pouch but the quality went down on Munsingwear when they started making them in Indonesia, availability declined, and the larger sizes are only a 2-pack at the same price as the 3 pack.I saw these and decided to try them and they are great. Plus they don't penalyze me for being a big man because I get 3 pairs in the pack. I don't know why anyone wouldn't want the horizontal fly. It is so much easier to access."
5,Jockey Pouch Brief,These shorts were recommended to my Dad 20 years ago as being more comfortable after prostrate surgery. He calls them his kangaroo shorts and now prefers them over any other. It was wonderful getting them through Amazon where I caught free shipping rather than at other on-line carriers where shipping charges were over half the price of the briefs.
3,Jockey Pouch Brief,"I liked them because They fitted perfectly, they are fresh and comfortable. Next time I will ask for specific size instead of general (like medium)"
3,waistband too high,"The waistband on these is oddly high. At it's narrowest (on the side of leg) it measures 8 (yes, eight) inches. Otherwise, these are ok."
3,sizing has changed,"I've bought these briefs for several years. Now, all of a sudden, the sizing proportions have changed. Too bad; I used to like them."
5,Comfort,Bought them for my husband. Other briefs rode up and in cracks. Jockey keep their shape and are very comfortable. The front pouch make access easier.
3,pouch brief,"I've been wearing pouch briefs for years. Love them, but after buying the 3 pack on line, washing them and wearing them I found that one pair had a hole in them. except for the flaw, I'm very satisfied and would have given them 5 stars"
2,Made OK but has very high waist,"Was looking for a cotton spandex combo, similar to the Jockey GO briefs which have, sadly, been discontinued. Prefer a full brief but this brief is almost full and a half. They are so long, even after washing, that one or two fold downs of the elastic are needed to get em to my normal waist. Every other full brief I've tried/used fits me fine and go just to my waist.These are just extra, extra, extra high waisted. Returned the other unopened packages and gone to looking around again."
1,Large is X Large?,What the hell!!! Doesn't Jockey know how to make underwear anymore? I've always bought this brand and my most recent order of the same size I've always bought all the sudden are bigger then before. the waist band surpasses my belly button.. (nothing like the guy in the picture) more like this link [...] Notice the product is now made in Columbia.. is this why they are bigger? Jockey better get this fixed cause in the future I might not buy Jockey brand again... And whats with the waist band? it keeps rolling down.. never had this problem.. Great underwear is the ones you don't have to adjust all the time (the way this brand USE to be) not the pain in the butt they are now.. Buyer Beware!!!If the size is large it should be large standard size not x large..
2,"Unique, in a marketing way","This product is non-functional. Side-exit is the only right way, these could end up being very embarrassing. They just did keep everything where it should be, and I found that the pouch exit feature is automatic. NOT a good thing, in case you're dense."
3,From the back cover,"A temporary marriage?Gilles Chauvigny blackmailed Lee into marriage for no other reason than that he wanted to get rid of his mistress, once and for all. To Lee's relief, like all of Gilles' arrangements with women, would be strictly temporary.But after the wedding things began to change. Lee soon realized that she'd fallen head over heels in love with her husband. Did she have reason to hope that their temporary marriage could ever turn into a permanent one?"
5,Better than I hoped for,This book was in better condition than I thought it would be. Came in a timely manner. Very pleased.
2,Be VERY Careful Before You Tread,"If the direction of training you are to give your children should be up to their own interests and desires, perhaps you should not teach them to brush their teeth either. They will pick it up on their own if they have an interest. If they don't still you save a lot of your time when you don't have to create the toothbrushing cirriculum for them.The inmates can very easily begin running the asylum if these concepts promoted here are taken in just about EVERY way that most people will take them.If you don't want to mess with your kids' education but you still want the feel-good experience of telling your church friends that you homeschool, then let your kids learn what they want. But it is your job to mold them and train them. For example, they don't like certain foods until you train them to like them. But the unschooling concept has a problem with that concept.You should approach this with grave caution."
4,"Great book, well written and researched!","It's hard to believe that there really is a handbook on how to unschool, but this really is! It explains clearly how unschooling works -- how it's different for everyone and yet gives lots of examples of what it includes and what it doesn't. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in education. It gives historical and practical reasons why unschooling is the way to raise children."
3,"Too Lengthy, but Overall Good","I have been homeschooling with a purchased school curriculum for several years. In spite of this, I've noticed that my children seem to learn lots of stuff on their own or just have an innate knowledge of things (how to spell words for example). Because of this, I became interested in unschooling. I had hoped that this book would give me a basic idea of how unschooling is done. It did that, but also gave me a lot of information that I just skimmed over. I could have done without so many personal accounts. Being a very busy homeschooling mother, I need just the facts with a few personal accounts thrown in."
4,Keeping learning interesting,"As a homeschooler who is trying to find more interesting ways of teaching I found this book VERY helpful.This book encourages a more relaxed teaching/learning style. It gave me permission to do things the way I had wanted but was afraid wouldn't teach the kids enough. I was encouraged to get away from the structured teaching at the kitchen table and take advantage of the kids natural curiosity. I am able to dig into topics they are interested in and no longer feel forced to get into things we are all bored learning. The kids interests propel the subject of the day/week/month. They are finding enjoyment in learning new things, not being forced fed boring material. It's awesome!"
4,"Just as ""homeschooling"" comes in many different styles - so does ""unshchooling"".","This book was full of good information, ideas and advice. I liked all the personal stories and the interviews with kids. I would recommend it to anyone considering unschooling."
5,Inspiring!,"I found this book to be exciting and inspiring! I had already made the decision to homeschool my children and unschooling seemed to be the approach I was looking for, but it was really uncharted water for me and my family. This book took the worry out of it and gave me a better understanding of how and why unschooling works, how it can be fun, intuitive and less stressful than anyone first imagines. I am going to give copies to the grandparents so everyone understands and has a better appreciation for the learning style we've chosen for our children. The vignettes from the unschooling families featured in the book were great, I pretty much read it straight through I was so eager to know more. I highly recommend this for all potential and current homeschoolers and their support system."
4,Grill review,"The Weber grill really looks good and preforms well. It does not take long to preheat and the temperture is accurate. Food cooks evenly, with very little flare ups. It is solid in construction. I just wish this model had the fold up side tables like a similar model, that would add needed space when you have several items you are cooking. The side burner works well also. would by this item again."
2,Poor warranty service,I purchased my grill after having used my previous Weber for 10 years. I used the grill for a month or so when the igniter began failing to light the grill. I notified Weber about the issue and received an email advisng me to clean the burner tube to solve the problem. Clean a brand new grill??? After spending $900 on a grill I don't expect to have to light it with a match but that's the sad truth. If you buy a Weber grill don't expect any customer service or the company to honor their warranty!
5,"It's heavy, like your mom.","My experience with CEVA was good. Seems like it took 5 days, much less than the estimated time given. It took my son and I one hour and fifteen minutes to assemble. Only drew blood once. Yeah, it's nice. Glad I got it."
3,Great start but needs work,"It is great that we, as verification engineers, finally have a book focusing on streamlining and improving the verification process. This book covers all the basics for building a verification plan, implementing it, and maintaining it. It also includes a very large compliment of examples right alongside the concepts to improve understanding. However, it is unfortunate that the author is caught not following his own principles in each example. I feel that I would learn his principles better through repetition, where each example builds on the concepts already presented. He presents bus functional models in one chapter, then starts again at the top in the next. This makes it hard for me to see the big picture. One large example at the end could make it easier for me to see all his principles together in one testbench. Otherwise I'm stuck taking notes..."
2,This compilation and BMG recordings in general,"Love Mozart but wish I could say the same about Sony's affiliation with BMG. As always; sonically, they leave a lot to be desired. I guess if you think the sound from BOSE products is wonderful, well I guess you'd think nothing is amiss with this boxed set. On the other hand, if you know what the Tivoli products in the sme price range sound like compared to BOSE, then you get the picture. This sets' sound is smearded, lacking in dymanics, and britle on my Convergent Audio Technologiy amp and pre-amp which for you not in the know, is all vacuum tubed gear costing about $30,000 for the combo. Am I annal, yes proud of it when it comes to listing to classical and jazz. Enough said...Ted"
1,"a definite its so bad,its awful","I usually don't give 'bad' reviews,but in this case i have to make an exception.I even like so-called 'cheesy 'B' horror movies' but this one flunks the test.Take my advice,unless you are super rich or super bored,pass this one on by.There's nothing to see here."
5,She Makes Math Fun,"I have purchased both of Leslie Helakoski's books. I have found each to be a delightful children's story with a clever message tucked lovingly between the pages. She is truly gifted in her efforts to ""teach"" children through the art of story - as so often our efforts as teacher/parents, etc. get filtered out.Each book offers the child the opportunity to read and discover something about themself (i.e. courage...""The Big Chickens"" or a fun with mathematics ""The Smushy Bus""). But her books also allow the delicious opportunity to share the reading within the intimacy of parent-child, teacher-student, sibling-sibling and enjoy the noticing of each clever phrase, each well-chosen word to more fully take in the entire experience of her books.Much applause to Ms. Helakoski for her gift not only to chilren but her gift to the legacy of books."
2,Not satisfied,"I bought what I thought would be a ""good"" condition book, as it said it was. However, after about a week of use 20 pages fell out because the binding had been that bad when I received it. Otherwise a good book, and I don't mind erasing the pencil marks I find in it. The condition is no where near ""good"", though."
4,balm,"i like the balm and it smells good and makes my skin soft, so the ladies say. anything to get those ladies right"
4,"An Imaginative, Colorful Book","This is a colorful, beautifully illustrated book. My youngest son isn't quite reading but he picked it out and spent time ""reading"" it by himself. We then read it together as a family. It makes not only a good counting lesson, but afterwards you can look up the animals that are featured to learn about them. They chose unusual animals, birds and insects for the book. We liked it very much and will read it over and over."
3,COULD be better,"I LOVE the author's Easy to Make Godeys Doll book. It gives one pattern for a body, plus all the patterns needed to make a complete mid-nineteenth century wardrobe. GREAT! That gives the doll-maker the option of making several different dolls, different fabrics, different faces, different hair. THIS one, on the other hand, gives several different patterns for bodies, each with one costume pattern. NON-interchangeable. Result: You cannot make a full wardrobe for any one doll. Only several dolls, each with ONE outfit. I would rather have seen fewer body patterns, and more interchangeability in the costume patterns."
2,Great while it worked,"I really enjoyed my Nano CHI iron while it lasted (RIP 7/06-11/06), it handles well, it's a great straightener, and it's a pretty color. However, I dropped it approximately two feet, onto a carpeted floor, and it stopped working. I purchased the CHI about four months ago and think that a $120 iron should be a bit more resiliant. I'll still purchase CHI products, but wouldn't recommend investing in the Nano Technology just yet...there are a few kinks that still need to be worked out, and it's not worth having to pay an extra $35 to have it repaired."
1,IS THIS THE REAL THING?,"THE PRICES OF CHI STRAIGHTNERS ARE 149-169.00 IN THE STORES, SO I THOUGHT THIS WAS A DEAL! THE PROBELM IS, THE BOX IS A DIFFERENT SHADE OF BLUE AND THE PRODUCT HAS A DIFFERENT COLOR CHI LOGO ON IT. THEREFORE, I WONDER IF THESE ARE 'KNOCK-OFFS.' TO FIND OUT, I BOUGHT A $$ CHI, AND TRIED IT THE FOLLOWING WEEK. THE $$ CHI GOT MUCH HOTTER AND HOLDS THE TEMPERATURE STEADY. I SENT THIS ONE BACK AND GOT MY FULL REFUND. NOW I WONDER ABOUT ANY ELECTRONICS SOLD ON AMAZON, ARE THEY THE REAL THING? I DO LIKE AMAZON AND THEIR SERVICES, BUT I AM ONLY BUYING NON-ELECTRICAL ITEMS FROM NOW ON."
3,2 YEARS LATER...,"I bought this chi nano in October of 2007, it was amazing at first I absolutely loved it. It's not staying up to it's original performance now (2 years later). It has trouble maintaining heat. For example the red light will blink (indicating it's heated up), after straightening my hair for about 2 minutes it stop blinking and starts reheating again. the straightness doesn't seem to stay as well anymore either. The edges of the iron have slightly burned (Don't know if they can/can't come off, i haven't tried yet). When I first bought it i paid $120 and I feel like a straightener worth $120 should last this shortly. Also, for those who are wondering, I used this iron 3-4 times per week. It took me about 15-20 minutes to do my hair. If you are like me and plan on using this heavily, I would suggest looking for a product that has greater durability. I'm currently looking into buying an Infrashine."
1,no warranty for farouk chi purchased online,Farouk will not provide warranty service on a Chi that you purchase online. There normal (in writing) warranty is 1 year from date of purchase.
5,Excellent Product!,"Since receiving this product, I've loved it! The color is beautiful and the quality of the item is excellent. It works wonderfully just as I had hoped."
3,its ok,"It doesn't have a temperature setting, that's what flash heating or whatever means. It is ok. I used to have a bomb-ass one that was a generic that I liked more, but since I don't live where I used to, I don't have access to it."
5,Yummy,My baby boy loves these rusks. I bought this product when he was 6 months old. Now he is 10 months old and smiles when he sees me opening a packet for him. They are easy to eat and melts quickly so he will not choke. My 4 year old also loves it too. I would recommend this product.
2,not good as I thought,"after reading all the reviews, I thought this is a good to buy, after it arrived, I gave it to my son who is 7 month old, but he doesnt like it at all. Then I found out it is too dry for his mouth. I tried it by myself, the taste is ok, no suger taste which is great. It reminds me what I had when I was little back to china. However, I can find the same stuff in a nearby chinese store for much cheaper price. If you have any chinese store nearby, I dont see any reason to have it for this expensive price."
5,My son would probably eat 5 million of these at a sitting if we let him!,"They are great for a quick on the go snack for a baby. They come wrapped two to a pack, so you can either give your child both of them or nibble on one if you're feeling desperate.They taste pleasant enough to me (not a strong flavor but light and a sort of fluffy crunch if that makes any sense), but they are like baby crack. I have yet to meet a baby that didn't love mum-mums. They are fabulous for teething-- in fact they helped us avoid numbing gels and pain killers during teething. They are also a fantastic find for snacks/distractions during grocery shopping or car rides (these saved us during a 14 hour train trip when our son was 8 months old).If you aren't sure, try a single box from a store. Your child will almost undoubtedly love them. Then come back here to stock up! The last time Amazon had a discount code for mum mums we bought 4 cases, and I'm kicking myself for not buying more already!"
5,Baby Mum Mums are Baby Yum Yum!,"My daughter might need to go to Mum Mum rehab before it is all said and done. She (and every other baby I have met or have heard of trying them) LOVES her Mum Mums. We've tried every flavor and honestly it doesn't seem to matter to my daughter. I ordered the veggie flavor just to see if it would be more cracker like flavor wise than the banana or plain, but she just gobbles them right up. If I don't watch out my husband eats them as well sometimes and the dog eats the little mushy pieces of mum mum that baby leaves behind."
3,Baby loves it!,"We've only tried the vegetable version but my 6 month old loves it. It dissolves right when you bite it, and she enjoys holding it and putting it in her mouth. I only gave it 3 stars because it is no different from the rice crackers they sell at the Asian groceries. I thought I was getting a good deal on Amazon, but the ones at the Asian groceries are only 2-3 bucks a package. I agree with a previous poster that this company uses an awful lot of packaging. It's a nuisance especially since there is so much eco-awareness nowadays.BTW, my two year old loves these too so I always have them handy in the trunk of the car. These will get crushed in your diaper bag, so stash somewhere safe :)"
5,GREAT first snack for baby!,"My 6 month old daughter LOVES these. I was, at first a little apprehensive to give them to her, as she gums them so hard she often breaks pieces off of them. I used to sit right next to her as she gnawed on them but as she is getting older she is chewing them more and can navigate them quite easily. Rarely she bites off more than she can chew and i just scoop it out of her mouth.They arent very messy, in my opinion, and are much easier to clean then the biter biscuits or arrowroot cookies.She likes all of the flavors, especially the veggie. She actually kicks her legs excitedly when I get them out of the package for her.I find they are cheaper to buy in bulk on Amazon than at Target, etc.The only downfall is they are not very portable as they snap and break with any pressure. These cannot be thrown in a purse or diaper bag (unless all you carry is packing peanuts) without breaking into a hundred pieces.OVerall a great product for eating at home."
3,Manufactured in China,"My 12 month old has just been diagnosed with a wheat/egg/nut allergy, so I have been hunting for snacks that she can tolerate. I was pretty excited to find these and I purchased the 6 pack. She does like them a lot, but I have to say that I was surprised to see that the rice husks are made in China. Had I known that fact, I would have never bought them. I wish Amazon would have listed that under product description."
5,Free 10 minutes!,"We love Mum-Mums! Any time I need ten minutes, Mum-Mums come to my rescue! They are a perfect consistency for early solid eaters. My son can feed them to himself with minimal mess and no fear of choking. They dissolve quickly and I love the fact that there is vegetable powder in it."
3,Sticky stick of a mess,"Baby Mum Mum makes a sticky mess. I suppose no more or less then other teething crackers. I do like that the grams of sugar is minimal compared to other teething biscuits. I started giving our 8 month old wheat, unsalted pretzels which is the perfect shape and size for his little fingers. The pretzels also create less of a mess. I give the Baby Mum Mums right before planned bath time."
5,My son loves these!,"My 10 month old son loves these crackers. I used them to ease him into eating solid foods. They dissolve fairly quickly so there is not as much of a chance he will choke on a big piece. Plus, they are gluten free so my son can eat them! The plain ones are ok but I do like the vegi ones the best. I tasted them - the flavor is very light and more interesting than the plain ones. These crackers are a great buy!"
4,"Wow! Good product, but really overpriced on Amazon!","Another reviewer said this and just I went and checked it out. These are available for way less-- even with the Amazon Prime free shipping the price here is a rip-off! I'm surprised, since prices on so many other things are so good. Unless the price goes down, I'll be buying these elsewhere from now on."
2,the strawberry flavor is better,"My daughter likes the strawberry mum mums. The strawberry ones are organic. I expected this one to be organic too, but it doesn't say it anywhere on the box. I also expected that since this was made from vegetables, it may have a little more nutrition. But it was no different than the strawberry. So there was no benefit from buying the vegetable ones plus they weren't organic. I'm going to stick with the strawberry ones from now on. If you buy the strawberry ones, make sure your little one doesn't have any allergies to strawberries."
4,Great Product!,"These are great! I started giving them to my daughter when she was 6 months old and desprite to feed herself. She loved them right away. They fit into her little hands perfectly. I have never had a problem with choking and she has had at least one a day for the past 4 months. They are great if you're on the go and just need to give them something to tie them over until you can properly feed them. I order them on line in bulk because they are hard to find. They have them at walmart and babies-r-us, but not always and never very many in stock. Walmart only carries the original and my daughter really likes the veggy ones the most."
5,THIS IS WHAT EVERY MOM SHOULD HAVE,"this is my second child and after using the Gerber biter biscuits and zwieback toast, I was disappointed that both could be so messy. Especially the biscuit melting and turning in a compacted cement that made my son cry when it was time to wash up. I just found these accidentally and bought 2 boxes. I am so impressed. My 7 month old loves them and can eat them with ease and I don't have to worry about largechunks breaking off and choking him. I still have to watch him eat them, but after eating one myself I found it tasty and it does dissolve so quickly I really can't anticipate a problem with any chunks. Not to mention they are much cheaper than any other biscuits I've seen and come in a handy 2 pack. I just wish I had found them sooner!"
1,Made in China,"I understand that many of our daily products are now made in China.And I am not saying that all products made in China are bad.I own many products around the house that are made in China.But food is something I refuse to buy that are made in China.In the product description, it does not specify that it's made in China.On the box I received indicates that it's*******************************************************************************************MANUFACTURED BY Guangzhou Yongwant Foods Co., LtdIMPORTED BY Liberty Richter Bloomfield, NJ 07003*******************************************************************************************I thought I would share with others who feels the same before wasting your money.My purchase 1 box (6 packs) went straight to the trash."
4,Mum Mums are Yum Yums!,"My baby is 7 months old and she LOVES these! They are easy for her to hold, dissolve almost instantly, have few ingredients, low calories, and make a great easy snack for home or on the go. I couldn't find veggie flavored in the store, only the original flavor. Buying these on subscribe and save makes them cheaper than in the store anyway, so, yay! I took off one star because these turn into paste when wet, so they stick everywhere. You will need a wet cloth nearby to clean up your baby and likely the area they are eating in. I don't know of any baby so far that doesn't like these. When my daughter goes through one pack she goes crazy for seconds."
5,"Best ""No Mess"" Snack Ever!","We started feeding these to our baby when he was around ten months old and he loved them right from the start. He is now 13 months old and I have to say, I love them better than the puff snacks, (although he likes those also), but these don't make the mess like the little puff snacks do. Baby holds on to the cracker and eats it, rather than dumping a bowl of puffs all on the floor, half of which usually end up getting vaccumed up. We think these are the best value for the buck as there is less waste, he enjoys them and best of all, no mess!"
3,packaging overload,"My baby loves these. However, the packaging is over the top. Do the rusks really need to be individually wrapped, as well as, wrapped in another plastic bag, inside of a cardboard box?"
1,not made in the usa,"these are awful, my 7 month old did not like them and eevn when I threw them out to the birds they didn't even eat them. What bothered me also is that they weren't even made in the U.S.A. I was surprised that Earth's Best had a low rating. She loved them, she was able to hold on to them better than these, they didnt just dissolve away like nothing. the Earth's Best is a million times better."
1,Made in CHINA! Choking Hazard!,"I was horrified to find out this product is made in China! Before realizing that, I did give it to my 5 month old baby. She liked it, but I had to watch her VERY closely. Pieces easily break off and do not dissolve quickly enough. She once choked on it, but luckily she was able to cough up the piece of cracker."
2,Tasty and no mess,"My daughter first had Baby Mum-Mum when she began teething at 6 months old. She is now 16 months old. She still likes these. They are quite expensive. There are certainly less expensive alternatives sold at the local Asian grocery stores. It is convenient to order from Amazon, but you do pay a premium for the convenience of not having to drive to your local Target store. The prices on a pack of 6 has consistently gone up these last couple of times I have ordered from Amazon as well...$17.50 now $19.30 for the same pack of 6. NOT to mention, Amazon now charges me taxes. Very annoying. I am starting to research alternative websites not only for baby products / food items for my daughter but also other products my husband and I buy. We love Overstock. They have great product selection, customer service and prices but, product selection is not always consistent. Just my feedback."
2,baby crackers made in china?,"I was really excited to order these crackers because my toddler liked them when a friend of mine gave her one, but I didn't realize that they were made in China. They dissolve really easily and are individually packaged, but come on now, do you really want to feed your child snacks that are made in China? It's up to you, but I know that I wouldn't have ordered it if I knew where it was made."
1,Not Happy,"I just received these, and I will not be giving them to my baby. They are made in China. No where on Amazon does it say that. Maybe some may view me as paranoid, but feeding my baby food from China is not something I feel comfortable with."
1,Buyer Beware - Can't Return This Product,"My wife ordered this, so I'm not sure if she was aware that this product came from China. When we got the pkg and learned that this was from China, we wanted to return it. But this product cannot be returned even if you haven't opened it. We will be throwing this in the trash. We just felt that food products from China are questionable, and we didn't want to risk this with our 8 month old son."
5,Baby Mum-Mum Vegetable Rice Rusk,"I had read some pretty good reviews and thought I would try them for my grandson who is 7 months old. He loved them and so did his mom. They are great to take along anywhere and don't make the mess like other treats. I hold it up and he gets so excited to see it and reaches for it. He has several teeth but we have never had any problem with him choking on them. They seem to dissolve in his mouth, even if he accidently bites off more than he should. I will certainly buy more and try other flavors."
1,Cheaper at Target,Item is fine. It is just over priced. Buy smaller quantity at cheaper price at target. Cannot return. Save your money
3,A grain of salt...,"It's surely important to realize the role of Darwinian thinking in Nazi Germany but the book gives short attention to the fact that Hitler and the Nazis relied heavily on the work of American eugenics ""scientists."" It's truly interesting to me how willfully ignorant some people will be. Take this view with a grain of salt and do your own research on where social darwinism and eugenics developed. Here's a hint: It wasn't in Germany!"
2,not sturdy,"Gorgeous sandle. Good quality. But sorry I missed the return deadline. These sandles need an ankle strap. the lower band seems to low for me and my foot is not secure enough to walk carefree. I don't even wear them for fear of falling. what a waste. (yes, i wear heels all the time)"
4,This is for 2-6th grade,"I read from one of the reviews that this was used in the middle school. Unfortunately, this was written for 2-6th grade teachers. This book is packed with ideas and guides for teachers - from forming the idea to publishing and recognizing the student authors. As a homeschooling mom, I was hoping for something similar to Razzle Dazzle which is written like a student text/workbook. Although a great resource, this wasn't what I was expecting."
5,Darkside Crooks,"I was blown away by this Album. Song 12 The Wino The Warlock And The Shogun may just be one of the greatest rap songs ever the beat the storytale raps and the 10 minute running time all come together for a killer song. Other stand out songs are song 1 Nuthin but the DSC, song 2 Orange and Blue, song 11 Whisky Weed and Sex and of course song 12. The rest of the songs flow great to make a smooth playing album that you can throw in your CD player and just hit play with no need to hit the skip button. You need to buy this album no matter what. Trust me."
3,Major disaapointment,"In short, this disc was a major disappointment for me at least. I did not like it because it was too mellow, lacking the richness of ""full music"". What I really mean is that it sounded like the CD was recorded with probably just three instruments with Kevin playing the Piano. I myself prefer rich music where a full orchestra is incorporated to enhance the music and I could think of three artists that are very good at this and they are Yanni, Secret Garden and David Lanz was very good at it in his latest release ""Skydance""."
5,The absolute best of Kevin Kern !,"IMHO, this is THE best of Kevin Kern bar none! The melody is so beautiful it hurts while warms your heart at the same time. This CD is a keeper in my audio system for sure.The quality is on par with George Winston but has more warmth and angelic beauty. Winston's work is more on clear/chilly side and can be appreciated in different mood."
3,"Hard to rate, haven't figured it out yet","I have several other hunting games, but this one is a stinker to figure out, I haven't seen an animal to shoot yet. I have to give it a 10 for the scenery though and the hunter and his movements.There are a lot of things to configure before you can play this game, you can't just start the game and play it. There are 3 difficultty levels to choose from, easy, medium and hard, I can't get through the easy one yet. I'm sure it will be a great game after I figure it out, but trying to do that isn't much fun."
4,Italian Adventure,"I am enjoying the book . It is a perfect read after having returned from a month in Italy. I am able to visualize Matera, Puglia, Otranto, and many other places. I can see myself in many of the experiences contained in the book. Enjoy, enjoy! Wow! I think I can contribute to Cusumano's next book about Italy!"
4,Somebody Release this on CD Please,"I had this album on LP a few years back. It is a collection of some truely unique Bill Monroe tunes, quite different than the typical Bluegrass Boys music, but still very Monroe! Sadly the mastering on the original album left a lot to be desired and there are some tracks that need to be remixed. I agree with the previous comment... Why oh why hasn't this exceptional piece of history been released on CD. It is well worthy of remastering and re-release."
3,"More like ""Ant As Metaphor""","Whoops! I thought this would be a science book about ants, a little like Wilson's bigger book. Instead it's a look at the different ways humans have described ants to make various arguments, from the admiring description of the ant's industry in Proverbs, to the frightening enlargement of ants in 1950's movies, to the more ironic 'AntZ'.The book is well-researched and well-designed, but I don't think I'll want to read any more titles in the series, which is apparently about human subjectivity, not animals."
4,Nice Track,"This is a nice track. When I roll down the street with my windows down, the mothers don't know whether to take their kids inside or start dancing on the sidewalk."
3,P2P - When you can connect :-(,"This book is a great starting point if you want to explore how to set up your own peer to peer network. It walks you through how to set up a file sharing program, an instant messenger, and a shared computing system. However, it leaves out what I believe to be one of the most important aspects of peer to peer programming - NAT traversal. The book deals with this subject in a very superficial way by telling you to seek out 3rd party solutions instead of showing you how to do it yourself - leaving you to figure out the details of this subject on your own. This would have been a 5 star book if this subject had been covered in greater detail.I have found that NAT traversal is possible by implementing UDP hole punching techniques. However, I have not found any explanation for how to do it with .Net....yet."
1,Hahaha,My 7 year old kid could create a movie better than this. They must have been trying for an award for worst movie ever.
5,An excellent book and a must for any dog library,"The book caputres your intrests all the way through, with its background, history, wonderful pictures and discussions of breeders who deeply care about this breed. Even my mother, a person not obsessed with dogs like me, was fascinated by the writings and history of this breed.The book caputres the true spirit of the breed and shows how special this little duck dog is.It is a must for every Toller owner and history lover . It is well worth the investment."
5,My boss was happy I could find this and order on line,My boss needed this book and was delighted I was able to find it on line. The price was reasonable as well.
1,"""Lost""? Says who?","First of all - these interviews were never lost, just ignored for the marginal value they have.Second - Beatles? Hardly, except for press conference quotes and peripheral documentation.What's that leave us with in this ""Lost Interviews"" book? More collating and occasional primary work with questionable expert witnesses (Jo Jo Laine? AGAIN?) - and collation is the work of a clerk, not a scholar.I'd ask how this so-called, self-appointed ""expert"" Giuliano sleeps at night after ripping off unsuspecting Beatles fans, but given the volume of his ""work"", I'd say he probably sleeps VERY well off all that Beatle-money."
2,Not very good,"I think I am on a string of bad luck with the books i have been reading. The last few of them have left me blah and this one is no exception.While I had enjoyed this author's previous works, this book does not work on many different levels.Basically 3 friends grow up together and more or less have a crush on the same guy. Only one of them ends up with him, but one of the other girls, who is now an adult is still very much in love with him.For one thing, the author does not really do a good job of explaining why this guy is so special. Why he would warrant a crush of over 20 years.Additionally, I had some reservations about all of the characters. They all seem to have their own agenda and gave the book a weird feeling.The ending is also weird as there are gender issues involved that don't mesh at all.Don't buy this book. It just does not work in too many ways."
2,Way too difficult to be worth it.,"This program is way too difficult to use. To begin with, it never could access my bank accounts in order to merge the information. Unless you have several accounts, investments, tons of debtors and have absolutely no organizational skills, this program is a waste of time and money."
2,A deception,"Not worth it. I nedded support for a country not supported in Money 2004 and saw it listed as available in Money 2005, so I give it a try. Found out the country was not supported and since you can not add currencies in this version, I ended up with a worst fit that the one I had with 2004. Besides, the program is heavier than the previous version so, summarizing, it is not worth the trouble. I just disinstalled it and went back to version 2004."
4,Great program.,I can't say enough about this program. It's really easy to use.You can download your account from your banks internet site. That way you are always up to date on your account. Pay bills online. Print out monthly reports. Track your monthly spending.Great program.
2,Get something else.,"Not going to go into a lot of detail as other reviews already have.Navigation is good in some respects and convoluted in others.The software should simplify money issues. Now I spend twice the amount of time as before trying to make the software work reliably. The online updates are great when they work. However, they are the least reliable part of this software. It has reverted back to old passwords on several occasions for no apparent reason. Budget section is OK if you don't deviate at all from the predefined categories. The budget handler of my old MS Money 1990 something was far easier to use and manipulate. Adding new categories and actually properly utilizing them in some meaningful way, downright mysterious."
2,Microsoft Money 2005,"I had Microsoft Money 2005 on my computer. When I lost my hard drive I found that the old CD for this program would not download to my new hard drive. I purchased this version of Microsoft Money 2005 because I really liked my previous one. This is not the same program I had previously though both say Microsoft Money 2005. In order to back-up on this one you have to use floppy disks. No other option is available. I am very disappointed in this. The program is okay, I just wish I had another way to back up my program."
1,"absolutely ineffective, don't waste your money","We have a problem with mosquitoes (Culex pipiens) in our apartment in Boston. We have no clue how they get in our home and so we sleep under a mosquito net to avoid nighttime bites but are stil attacked when we are not under the net. I bought this unit out of desperation, in hopes that it would catch the little pests. It looked very promising, with it's sticky paper, attractant bait and warm humidity generation, BUT I've had it plugged in and assembled as per the instructions for over 3 days and the unit has caught NO mosquitoes. Meanwhile, my girlfriend and I have killed three ourselves, the old fashioned way, by slapping them as they try to suck our blood. Unfortunately, this product is worthless. So we'll be sleeping under our mosquito net for some time to come...."
4,Good debut,"Nature is certainly a good MC and this is a solid debut, but some of the production sounds a little dated. Still, overall, it is a very solid debut. There aren't any bad songs, but I thought the top tracks were Man's World, ... Like This, The Ultimate High, Go Ahead, and Smoke. Nas makes the only guest appearance, while several big names do the production. Tone & Poke do most of the production, but get help from Lord Jamar, LES, EZ Elpee, Ski, Gowdy, and Tim Riley. Fans of NYC and QB rap will like this."
5,Good Album,Nice beats and strong flow. A good album is something I can put on and listen without skipping around to different tracks. This is one of them... Good work Nature.
4,"Possibly, hip-hop's most underrated album.","Amazon.com really needs to incorporate the half a star rating tiers. Nature's For All Seaons is a four and a half star project, and nothing short of it.First off, Nature is a truly gifted emcee. Solid flow, hot lyrics, and a true lyricist. Major street credibility can be awarded to this cat. I don't care how corny you claim that sounds, step back and realize this dude is one of the game's best. Just simply overlooked and left in the dust. There's no telling what this cat's doing these days, but the man is gifted with the art.This album was pushed back, and pushed back, etc. Finally, it hit the streets. While most legit hip-hop fans enjoyed this album, millions missed out. Such a shame too. One of the best hip-hop albums of 2000. No doubt. I would urge anyone to get this. You don't even have to be an underground hip-hop fan to really appreciate this one. San Franciso backpackers, to West Virginia wigger hill billies will get something from this album."
4,Tight CD,"I didn't even know that this CD dropped, so I guess the marketing wasn't what it should've been, but man is it tight. Nate drops introspective lyrics all throughout. The beats are pretty solid and my favorite tracks are ""we ain't friends"", ""young love'"", ""smoke"", and ""I don't give a f@ck"". Really though, they're all pretty tight. Don't sleep like I did. If you love that QB ish then you need to cop this..."
4,Listen to sounds of Nature,"This is a dope album like Killah Priest and Sadat X's first joints that is misunderstood and certified wood instead of gold. In hiphop in this era that happens to so much creative music. The rhyme style is unique and indivualistic as it should be, a project influenced neo-realism if you will. I don't give@... and Smoke are the choice tracks. Young Love is a well told story as well, this is one of the best albums of 2000."
3,From the Front Row... Live! by Teddy Pendergrass DVD,From the Front Row... Live! by Teddy Pendergrass I could not rip / download this album to my computer either plays on other devices just cannot record.........what to do?
2,Should not be a dvd.....Audio ONLY,"This was suppose to be a gift as a dvd video, however comes with only 1 song as a dvd.....buyer beware."
3,Favorites but...,I have been eating these for approximately one year. The Orange Smoothie is my favorite flavor. In the past I have been able to purchase at Costco warehouse but have unable to find in the last few months. I turned to Amazon. I ordered 10 boxes so I wouldn't run out any time soon. That was a mistake on my part. The product came stale and hard to eat. I should have returned as it turned out all ten boxes were bad. (I opened each box searching for a fresh one.) Will try to find another vendor for these.
5,very tasty,My husband and 6 year old daughter love these! He takes them to work for a quick snack. They are very good. It is hard to believe they are good for you. I like all their products. Plus they do fill you up.
2,Change in recipe for orange smoothie?,I have been ordering these for years and really enjoyed them. However the last batch of Orange Smoothie tasted very different from the past. Almost like sawdust. Hope its just a temporary thing. The other flavors were good.
4,"Good bars, great taste","For a diet/protein bar, these ones are very good. They have a great flavor and good nutritional content for a bar. Lots of protein, not much fat, not too many calories. Good flavor and texture."
5,The Treasure Box,This was the first book I have read by this author. I loved it. It can be read on different levels. This book shows the power of looking at circumstances from different perspectives. It also gives the concept that a change in belief not only affects our future but also changes our past--it seemed like she was saying that this included our physical past and not just our perception of it.
5,Delightful,"Just enough magic to make it special without making it ridiculous. Well written, interesting, and a keeper. I bought this one as a gift for someone who lives too far from a library, and she was as delighted with the story, as I was."
5,Fabulous,This is a DVD I will watch again. I first rented it from Netflex and then had to buy it. Annie is an artist with the lens and the photographs and the story of her life are so very well told. This is a must for any lover of photography and you will fall in love with Annie Liebovitz.
2,Disappointment,When I purchased this video it did not note that I would not be able to view it on my kindle. Very disappointing and I would not have purchased it if I had that information.
2,Can be bought cheaper,This exact futon with matress can be found for half the price elsewhere. Dont pay this much for it!
2,"I hate to disagree, but...","I found this follow-up to the great ""Toca's Miracle"" a big disappointment. It's just nothing special. I know a couple of club DJs who agree with me. It just lies there. The remixes are disappointing mainly because the vocals are practically non-existent, which has become common place these days, it seems. Why would they want to remove a vocal hook from a song? Just makes no sense. In addition, this is just a paint-by-numbers song. Perhaps my expectations were too high because I LOVED the first hit, but this doesn't even come close in comparison."
5,This Will Keep You Dancing All Night Long!,"Toca's Miracle was an awesome dance track,but, Fragma has far surpassed that with ""Everytime You Need Me"". The energy this song has makes it one hell of a party starter and Maria Rubia's vocal are simply amazing. It's a must have for all dance fans."
4,JustSayKnow,"Sitting and spinning online, this thing is pumping through my sub, not bad.... lotta bass, sounds good, good enough to buy......"
1,Pathetic Instruction...,"This garbage is not worth owning. The creator is borderline insane. His ideas are that boxing is the only way to fight, and his broken English is next to impossible to follow. The creator or his representitives are online over on Yahoo and plague the clubs with SPAM and obnoxious posts even after being asked to stop repeatedly. The material that we have viewed is poorly made and the instruction is of very poor quality. You would be better off going to a third grade playground and learning to fight from the class bully. Do yourself a favor and do not waste your money on these vidoes. He has further made reference that America deserved the attack on the 9/11. I would not give this man ANY American money."
5,Great book,"This is a wonderful book from Night Shade Books. They always put in such loving care to their products. I love the bindings, the paper, and the typeset. Overall, lovely."
5,Great microwave!,My husband and I love this microwave. It has a nice design and is really easy to use. The size is great for everything that we have needed to microwave. I would definitely recommend it!
4,BSA Twin Restoration,"Not a must, but a great book for the owner of the BSA unit twin and the BSA enthusiast in general. The title is a bit deceptive - it's not really a ""how-to"" restoration guide, rather, it's a collection of information about the bikes. The chapters take you through each model's evolution and the book concludes with a wealth of appendices covering everything from serial numbers to carb. set-up. A great book for facts, figures and photos - just don't expect a detailed workshop guide. -Bill Litant, president emeritus, BSA Owners' Club of New England"
3,The comics journal issue,"I bought my version of ""Eve"" from the recent issue of the Comics Journal that contained it and I was really pleased with the beautiful, but sometimes too cute artwork contained within this ""graphic novel.""My only complaint is that it's far too short to be considered such a classic in the eyes of cartoon historians."
1,derivative mediocrity,"Lacking both the visionary creative force of artists like Cecil Taylor and the honest (if sometimes misguided) integrity of his more famous (and more talented) brother, the former leader of the Tonight Show band has unleashed another collection of bland derivative mediocrity on the unsuspecting public."
3,Beautiful shoes but very uncomfortable!!!,The shoes are beautiful yet they're very uncomfortable. I wore them to a wedding and couldn't wait to take them off. They have been back in the box since that wedding.
1,Great story but poor edition screen play,"Heads Up-This is not a novel or book. It is a small paperback, stapled-together screen play edition. Print is very small and difficult to read. I do not recommend this edition, even though it is a wonderful story and movie."
5,Foxfire Forever!,"Oates' novel begins with a furious pace and never lets up. The prose mirrors the feeling and the action of the novel -- fast-paced, raw and vibrant. Legs Sadovsky is one of the most memorable characters I have encountered in a long time -- a complex character that needs another book! I read this book in one sitting because I just couldn't stop reading. I had to find our what happened to Foxfire and Legs and why these girls ended up separating. The way Oates develops the chracterization of the gang, as if it were a character itself, is fantastic. We watch the gang go from petty vandalism to violence and prostitution, and the whole way we can understand why they have made the choices they do. I felt for these characters and never once thought they went too far, even their final act which seals their fate."
4,Foxfire Forever-Girls Unite,"This book is the essense of girl power. It shows the risks and revelations teenage girls go through. I can see myself and my friends in Matty, Legs, Goldie, and Violet. They did what I would have love to have had the courage to do. I highly recommend this book, it is for all types of women that were at one time or wished to be at one time a rebellious teenager, not wanting to conform to what everyone else thought they should be."
5,Amazing,"This is Joyce Carol Oates at her best. Foxfire is about jealousy and revenge. A group of girls led by Legs Sadovsky decide to plot against the men who have oppresed them, abused them, violated them, and used them. The reader watches the evolution of Foxfire; Foxfire develops from a few girls planning revenge against a teacher by spraypainting his car to a murder. Justifuong their revenge through their angerness, the Foxfire women refuse to be victimized further. What makes Foxfire is amazing is that the reader feels the constant tug between the lack of moral validity of Foxfire's actions and the intense desire for revenge. An excellent book full of himan conflicts"
5,"Fast, edgy, otherworldly.","Written in the style of SIGHTS by Susanna Vance, FOXFIRE also moves into the fast, troubled world of an extrodinary teen and her followers. The worlds of Joyce Carol Oates are not for the faint of heart ."
1,not so good,"I had to read this book as a research project for an english project (im in 11th grade). I was very disturbed and sort of shaken up by how descriptive everything was. It was kind of unnerving to hear about these girls lives, and how terrible they are all the while knowing that they are basically the same age as me. I brought this to my teachers attention and she read the book and agreed that I should stop reading it, but that I didnt have time to read another book. I wrote my paper on this book, even though it disturbed me so much. My thesis? Violence, Rape, Molestation, and powerlessness and how they affect the lives of young women today, reading about it through the eyes of young fictional characters. Needless to say, I got an A."
1,"it gets 1 star for the cover of the book, which I liked","This book was so horrible. It was given to me by one of my friends for Christmas. I'm so glad I didn't actually part with legal tender for this putrid novel. I forced myself through the book, not caring what happened to any of the characters who were flat and boring. It was the biggest waste of time (like something you'd read in a WGS class). And why is it that the only story I ever come across in anthologies by this woman is ""where are you going, where have you been""? Is this her best story? How pathetic..."
1,This book isn't good at all,I really hate this book! I have to read it for school and I think that it is one of the worst books ever. Please do not subject yourself to this terrible book
4,passionate account of a girl gang,"Written in a passionate rush of often purply prose, ""Foxfire"" is the story of a girl gang which performed feminist acts before feminism was as taken for granted as it is now. Led by the charismatic and enigmatic Legs Savodsky, the group moves from vandalism and physical acts of aggression to kidnapping, this comes at the very end and is, as you might suspect, the end of the gang as well. Chronicled by the author's stand-in Maddy Wirtz, a former ""good girl"" who is going against (she tells us) the long ago warning not to tell anyone about Foxfire's affairs. But, as she says, who is around to stop her. Great book - and also 1996 movie worth searching out."
1,Glad I'm not the only one,"Okay, so Ms. Oates has a lovely way of describing some things. I read a few passages aloud to a friend of mine. But her lack of grammar and complete thoughts made me dizzy and confused. How can anyone read this?Stick with the movie."
3,Not so good,"I wanted to like this book. It started out good. As I read on, I started to get bored. Borrow it from a library if you can. Save your money."
3,It was okay,"I'm a Huge fan of Oates, but out of all her books that I've read so far, this book was my least favorite. My favorite is probably ""Them."" I found the storyline to be unrealistic, where as, in most of Oates other novels the characters are far too real."
1,Couldn't finish it.,"This book started out bad, and never got any better. I couldn't finish it because it could not keep my attention. The author spoke about different girls and the characteristics of their personalities - it was very blah. I would not recommend it unless you have a lot of patience to get through the boring part - I didn't read the end, for all I know, it could have turned out ok."
4,A bit too academic for the average person,I am enjoying reading this book but prefer history books written in a less academic manner. I would recommend it to the well informaed.
1,Mediocre Sambo Book,"I have studied the grappling arts for years and currently train in Judo and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. I bought this book to add some techniques to my arsenal of moves and what I saw was what already knew from my training. The photographs are in black and white and there are very few close-ups on the techniques. If you have any formal training in the grappling arts this book is not for you and if you are looking for books on grappling don't buy this book. I suggest you buy books on Judo, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and wrestling or attend a school that offers instruction in those styles. I think Sambo is an excellent martial art and if you live near a Sambo school train there."
2,Not soft,"On the face of it, this saddle seems soft - do any distance on it more than a mile and it's full of hard pressure points."
2,schwinn bike seat,This looks really nice and is more comfortable than a stock seat but it is nowhere near as comfotable than the cloud 9 countour seat. A screw did fall out of the bottom on me and I needed to put a larger one in to hold the tongue together.
3,Air seat,"The seat is a bit stiff when it first arrives, but after breaking it in, it's not too bad. Only major problem I noticed was that the rubber plugs on the underside keep popping off when I sat down and the screw that held the plastic to the seat eventually fell off. The seat is fine but construction of the body is horrible."
3,no that hot,"I usually love Ma, but I don't know why I am not so hot on both of the new super discks. Perhaps it is the miking. I'm surprised noone mentioned it. My CD player is a Meridian. I would be interested in hearing how this effects the pleasure of listening to CDs."
4,Yo-Yo Ma has done it again....,"This album truly lives up to all we have come to expect of the world's most prominent cellist. Ma's sweet nuances do wonders for the classic baroque pieces, bringing these standards to life in a most enchanting way. Unfortunately, only two composers are showcased in this recording (but the pieces prove to be good selections). Well worth your time and money."
2,Makes you sleepy,"This CD offers music from two composers, J. S. Bach and L. Boccherini. Several famous pieces from each composer are included here as performed by Yo Yo Ma. Having heard all the pieces before on other CD's, I did not like the instrumentation offered here. Many of the pieces were quite subtle and played with too little life. The instrumentation was too little as most of these pieces sound better with a whole symphony playing it, where here it was only a couple of instruments. Overall, not that great a CD."
3,A ghost movie in modern clothes,"The demon filed caves of Afghanistan are the setting fora twisted fight between good and evil. The soul of a brother cries outcalling to a cave of demon Mongol warriors.What was a rich warlord's extraction becomes the death of all buta few. The filming in the cave is too dark, so that a lotof plot detail is lost; a very dark movie with an ironic ending."
3,I need a tougher rhino than this!,"The design of the aluminum case is pretty good for the T3. The cushioning liner has proved its usefulness several times already.The pin that is supposed to hold the case to the belt clip required much more forceful tightening than was at first apparent. I learned this when the pin worked loose from the case and the case fell to the pavement--minutes after I had put it together per included directions. I wonder why a tougher lock washer/nut was not included.The plastic belt clip seemed to work pretty well--until I was getting out my car after about a week. The case snagged on the edge of the doorway as I stood up, and the belt clip broke without offering much resistance.Is this review the place to request a new part? When I know more about customer service, I'll add more to this review."
5,"Beautifully written, warmly expressed","This is a wonderful book, whether you are a beginner or an experienced reader. The focus on intuition, with examples, enables a reader to make the cards come alive in your hands. The author's wonderful, heartfelt love affair with the magical Tarot comes alive in this book, and inspires the reader to fall in love as well. Highly recommended."
5,A MUST HAVE BOOK!,This is really a wonderful book! The best advice I have ever been give came from this book.. and that was simply to NOT look at a traditional tarot book for three months.. to just give the psychic muscles a try. Of course those who study tarot should know the traditional meanings.. but learning to read by memorizing 78 definitions is not only daunting.. but teaches nothings except that you can memorize. This book shows you how to use Tarot as a tool.. and helps you learn to trust yourself and your own intuition.. It makes reading fun!!! It makes you feel as if you can't make a mistake.. It lets your imagination run wild.. I LOVE it!!!
2,Airheaded.,"Though this book provides a refreshing perspective on the interpretation of the tarot (no more little white booklets with keywords!), I found it rather bland and predictable. It certainly has a joyful tone and inspiring message, but the intuition is much more complicated and unreliable than implied in this book. Though I don't doubt Ms. Morgan's sincerity, it seemed like something written to appeal to the New Age mass market and not much more.If you have even a passing acquaintance with intuited divination, this book will not present you with any new information. If you are interested in a more serious and detailed look at tarot interpretation, try the works of Rachel Pollack."
2,"Stupid,boring,old.","I had red that this book was full of suspance.But I lost my time.It's not interesting,nothing surprised me,the final is stupid.And the characters are not realistic."
5,Stunning depiction of the obsession & delusion we call love,"Rich in insight and fomenting of anger, this brooding depiction of the lengths to which one might go in a search for meaning through the madness of love is devastating, catastrophic, heartbreaking, and real. In doomed Stella, blind, rigid Max, and helpless little Charlie we see examples of the ravages desire plays amid the torrent of our lives.A crushing statement about the delusion which hides within us all."
4,"vintage McGrath, yet realistic..","It's hard for me to give an objective review of any material by McGrath since I think his writing style is so excellent and remarkably compact. However beyond style, his material is always interesting (especially for those who enjoy the macabre).In a very broad sense, Asylum is like Dr. Haggard's Disease from a woman's perspective. A middle-aged woman is ""possessed"" by an uncontrollable love for someone who is rather .. unlovable (as most homicidal psychopaths perhaps are), yet she is fully aware of this possession and its inevitable outcome. Asylum re-enforces the notion that love is blind, which in this case is a very bad thing.Unlike McGrath's other novels, Asylum presents a completely plausible story (and therefore, in my opinion, it is not a gothic novel). So it should have wider appeal than his other works. I also encourage readers of Asylum to buy Dr. Haggard's Disease, which is actually a more focused and ""intense"" read (..from a male perspective)."
4,Great gothic psychological thriller!!!!,"A great novel about sexual obsession and how it can destroy lives. Stella's journey that McGrath takes us through is riveting and amazing. There were some very interesting twists that i did not see coming, and i enjoyed the whole gothic feel of the book-the lonlieness, the cold, the isolation, the large victorian homes void of love, etc.. I look forward to reading other novels by this talented author!!"
4,When madness strikes,"Superbly prose outlines the boundaries between insanity and reality in Asylum, Patrick Mc Grath's new novel. Asylum portrays the life of an isolated woman, whose meaningless present drives her to fall obsessively in love with one of the hospital's patients. Stella, that's her name, sails into a sea of hesitation when it comes to her plight. This hesitation eventually will become obsession, making Stella drift into the arms of insanity, abandon and self-degradation. No trace of the old Stella will remain and the horrific consequences of her deeds will haunt her life ever since. What deeds? What consequences? Those are what Asylum is about, fusing such facts into an ending so appropriate and worthy of this story. Ultra compelling story, slow though, which strikes the reader due to its veracity."
1,didn't like it much,i found this book depressing. there didn't seem to be any redeeming part to it at all. it wasn't the worst book i've ever read but it was pretty far down on the list.
2,Asylum,"Very Depressing, I would definitely not recommend it, it ended very badly, it was not worth the time reading it."
5,Might just bring me back to fiction...,"I don't read much fiction anymore. I had read McGrath's earlier fiction,Spider,Dr. Haggard's Disease,The Grotesquemany years back and frankly adored them all - his ability to create a sense of unease and dis-ease, his use of unreliable narrators who fascinated and repulsed at the same time. I never quite got around to picking this up until I very recently ran across it and had a very rare opportunity to spend a blissful day of forced reading time (aka - jury duty). I took Asylum with me and finished it later that night.There are enough thumbnails of the plot and main characters in the other reviews posted here. I'll not run it all by again, but I will say that McGrath is a masterful storyteller and marvelous stylist and, for what its worth, I picked up a copy ofMartha Peake: A Novel of the Revolutionyesterday. I may just end up adding a regular dose of fiction back into my diet."
4,"Passion, Guilt, Terror, and an Insane Asylum","""Asylum"" is a terrific book, and I'm sure it will make a terrific movie.This is the story of the wife of a deputy superintendent of a mental hospital (as told by a family friend/hospital colleague). The wife falls passionately in love with a mental patient and seems to be completely out of control as a result. Nothing drives her but this passion. The passion eventually destroys everyone around her.The narrator of the story, who you grow to trust and respect deeply, turns out to be possibly as passtionately obsessed as the woman.Bottom line: A page-turning thriller."
4,Nice Building of Tension to a Slow Release,"Patrick McGrath's Asylum is certainly a well written book that builds a chilling story of obession. Stella Raphael, the main character, is slowly entwined into the web of Edgar Stark, a patient at the asylum where her husband works. The reader will watch (read) in horror as this relationship sends all of the characters spiraling downwards. It is wonderfully Gothic with a very contemporary feel for the characters. All of this delicious tension build and grows with restrained ferocity during the novel and this reader found the ending of little release for all that came before it. Still, an interesting and excitingly depressing read."
4,Moody,"Somewhat Gothic, somewhat Victorian, ""Asylum"" is a darkly entertaining story of relationships made and broken among the asylum's psychiatrist, his wife and a murderous patient. It's a moody, pensive book, full of imagery and foreshadowing (maybe a little heavy-handed at times). As other reviewers have pointed out, the plot is driven by Stella and her struggle, although Max and Edgar are both effective as supporting characters. McGrath succeeds in building suspense and dread toward a compelling ending. This book won't change the world, but it's worth a read."
2,"Dull, predictable","The lack of character development and plot was disappointing. The prose read like a clinical report. I'm sure that's what the author was going for when he used the doctor as the narrator, but it lacked suspense. Predictable and boring."
1,A Most Unremarkable Book,"I read 60 pages of Asylum, skimmed another 60 pages and read the last two pages to see if I had missed anything. I didn't. In fact, this female reader was terribly disappointed and didn't find Stella a convincing, sympathetic or unsympathetic character. The story idea of Asylum is compelling but the writing was far from it. Stella is a stereotype of a bored housewife who has a sexual escapade (calling it obsession is too glamorous) with a psychotic man. McGrath's chronicling of Stella's relationship with Edgar--how an average person mentally unravels when she has a sexual relationship with a homicidal maniac--is flat and unconvincing. None of the characters was remarkable. In short, Asylum is vacuous at best."
1,"Why is ""Asylum"" so praised?","Having never read Patrick McGrath before, I decided to buy ""Asylum"" based on the positive reviews here and after seeing the terrific film based on his book ""Spider"". I do not usually write reviews but I felt I had to balance the praise this book has received. The detached narration does not allow you to connect to any character, let alone understand their motivation through the ridiculas plot turns. It is a novel less about ""obsession"" than it is about stupidity. If you were looking for a ""gothic thriller"", leave this book behind - it reads more like a supermarket romance novel."
4,Very dark story,"I enjoyed this book very much. Stella's character is one I would compare to Flaubert's Madame Bovary. She totally consumes herself and other lives around her with her sinister attraction to Edgar Stark. I think it's a very true-to-life story, though, as we've all known people like her. As tragic as it is, I came away from it feeling entertaiined and enlightened by the psychology of the piece. Edgar Stark is no typical villain or character at all. He has many dimensions and his shifts into violence from a seemingly ordinary man are chilling. No doubt, this book is a fine read for anyone who wants more than just some pop fiction. I think it will stand on its own for several years and I highly recommend it."
4,Top Notch Psychological Suspense,"This is a classic study of obsessive love (or sex, if you will). I loved every minute of it, even the dreary second half with our lust-crazed heroine stuck in the Welsh boondocks.Pay attention to the narrator because you will be in for a surprise! Enjoy!"
4,Wonderfully Written,"This book was very good....you can read this book in one sitting but I had papers, presentations, exams and work deadlines but it was a very good read. The author writes wonderfully. It was a breath of fresh air because lately I feel that so many writers use a formula in their writing.. He covers all points and bases you are not left wondering what happened to anyone. He covers very well the human relationships that we carry with one another. He brilliantly writes about what one is capable of when we are lonely. The ending was not likely at all though. The chance of that happening is a snowballs chance in hell HOWEVER with his writing you are still interested because you come to understand that it all comes down to loneliness with the characters in this book! This one is most def staying in my book collection...This is not one of the best STORIES I have read but it is one of the best WRITTEN books I have read.. The man is brilliant!"
2,what's the fuss about?,"The characters are wooden, and the writing even more so. We never understand why on earth Stella is attracted to what's-his-name, much less why anyone would be attracted to her. The problem isn't that the narrator is untrustworthy -- so was the narrator of Ford Madox Ford's The Good Soldier, but that was a compelling novel -- but that the author himself seems to have the attitude, 'Now that I have an idea for a plot, why waste time coming up with some three-dimensional characters to execute it when I have these cardboard cut-outs all ready to go?"" The overall effect is juvenile in the extreme, like a Dick and Jane book set in an asylum. The only thing that kept me awake and turning the pages was annoyance"
3,An OK book...,"This was an interesting read with a great deal of forshadowing that had me hooked from the very begninng. I actually think this is one of those books that's better to listen to than read because the narrator, Sir Ian McKellen was fantastic!"
2,The book was driving me insane.,"I was so anxious to get to the end - I kept hoping for some suspense. The book just didn't deliver. The ranting and groaning and whining just went on...and on...and on... I could have written a better ending: I kept waiting for Edgar to show up. Or at least Max to go berserk. Or how about the whole cycle starting again with Stella dancing with the phychiatrist... Nothing. I only felt sympathy for innocent Charlie - all the other character got on my nerves. Stella was an alcoholic cat on a hot tin roof, Max was a spineless dweeb (I could see Bill Pullman playing him in the movie version - if, God forbid, there was one). Unfortunalety, I can't blame the decision to read this on anyone - I stumbled upon this book in the bookstore and thought the cover was cool."
4,"Cute, but not anything special",I bought this for the pastel colors for my daughters birthday. She does prefer these over the white set that came with her play kitchen. I would buy it again because it is cute and stacks okay.
4,sturdy,We bought this play dish set to give to Toys for Tots (U.S. Marine sponsored) but it looked real sturdy and nice for children.
5,An excellent buy!,"What a great buy. I was a little leary a great price, but would it be a good product and yes it is. I would highly recommend it. I had bought this for my granddaughter who is 3 years old, she loves it as well as the pastel colors, a wonderful addition to her kitchen set."
3,Not all pieces included!,I am very disappointed. I opened the box which was sealed to find one cup and one fork missing. I will be contacting someone to get the missing pieces but my daughters are enjoying them and they are a very thick plastic that looks like it should hold up. Only downside is the incomplete set!
3,Childs Cookware set,"I bought this cookware set for my 1 year old grandaughter's fisrt birthday because she had received a kitchen center also. I liked the pastel color because it matched the other items she received. But the quality was alot less than what I expected. It was a thinner plastic than what it looks like in the picture and the items are somehwhat smaller in ""real life"". Not tiny, but smaller. Had I have seen it in the store I would not have purchased it. But I am not so disappointed that I will pay the postage to return it."
5,It was a Hit!,"I have a grandson that wanted cups, plates and bowls to play with. I have been about a year looking for something not pink or princess. I also was on a budget. These dishes are beautiful and he was very happy. He will get them out even when he is not playng with them, just to see them.They are durable, bright and exciting for him. I think they are even better then must princess or Barbie sets. I will look at this sight more often."
5,Nice size and durable,"This set of dishes is great, bright colors, large enough to hold ""food"", and not a real hard plastic. More durable because it can be dropped and it won't break like the brittle plastic sets."
1,Always Flat,"This ball was a total waste of money. My son had only used it 3 times when it started to go flat. I had previously purchased a Spalding Never Flat Basketball. It stays inflated and we've had it for over a year. But I would not recommend the Never Flat Soccer Ball. I think kicking it around just knocks the air of out it, hahaha."
1,cheap quality,"The plastic is very thin and the CD fits VERY tightly. You have to maneuver it all the way into the sleeve. But the size is fine for the thin jewel cases (which doesn't help me). If the CD is facing you, the flap closes over the top and seals on the back. So the creases of the sleeve run along the sides of the CD, potentially blocking an easy view of the information."
2,Only last a little longer than cheap non-stick pot,"It was a big purchase for me to own a cookware like this. In the beginning, I was pretty happy with it and thought I finally own my dream pot. I tried everything I can to take care of this cookware, using silicon spatula, always set the cooking temperature at medium, washed it with hand... After an year of purchase, it sticks. I am getting more and more frustrated everytime I use it. I am trying to contact the company to see if there is anything they can do since they promise lifetime warranty. I think I am going back to cast iron pot which has lasted almost ten years. This is such a expensive lesson!"
4,GREAT F U K C ING OLD SCHOOL SH1T!!,"This is it!! Some of the best old school jams, are packed into this cd by the one and only RBL POSSE!! If you don't think you know who they are, think twice. Chances are you've heard at least a song or two of theirs but didn't know what the fukc you were listening to...song's like ""lesson to be learned"" and ""ain't no joke"" still get play to this mutha fukcking day! Buy this sh1t quick, cause you won't regrit, peace mutha fukcas."
1,Buy the U.S. version,"This is just the Japanese version of the Dissident (Epic #1) single. When I bought it from Amazon I was expecting the entire three cd set, which this is not. Since you can buy the US version of the exact same cd for five bucks save your hard earned 25 dollars and buy that instead. Five stars for the US version, 1 star for paying 30 dollars for the import."
1,No Good!,"I think Thomas Mapfumo has gotten too much milage out of using the word 'chimurenga' in his album titles. This album has, despite the name and the picture of Ambuya Nehanda on the cover, nothing to do with Chimurenga music as I understand it.When I think of what the second Chimurenga actually was, I do not think of the Rhumba and Reggae pop that is on this album. I love a lot of Thomas Mapfumo's work, but this album is a real nose-blower. It may appeal to middle-age 'world music' fusion jockeys from Northern Europe, but otherwise, forget it.Not Chimurenga!"
1,Photo is misleading,"I wanted a flat tongs to flip fish fillets in a skillet. First issue was to find out (after it was too late) that the shipping on this item is over six dollars for a $13+ purchase. IMO, the shipping amount was too high (should be free like most items on Amazon). After this item arrived, I noticed that it would not fulfill my needs and I sent it back and received only a credit on the $13 but I had to eat the six dollars shipping. Please make sure if you really need to actually spend $20 for an item that should only cost one-half to two-thirds of this product."
3,Like it,I bought this table for my boyfriend as a birthdaygift and used it a lot. The table is stable and you got what you paid for it. I would not recommend it for professionals because the putting it up and down takes tooo much time if you have to do it a lot or need to travel. You also can NOT attach a headrest.
4,Massage Table,"The trenton massage table is a bit awkward to set-up, but it is really soft. It is heavier than some of the other portable tables on the market, but still manageable."
1,Bring back Michael,I have all of Avalon's cd's and I have seen them in concert about 5 times now. I was heartbroken when I found out at a concert last summer that Michael Passons had left the group. Greg Long (even though my mom loves him as a solo artist) really didn't seem to fit in the group very well. I got this cd with very low expectations. I heard it all and all it made me want to do is listen to all my other Avalon cd's. Where's the harmonies? You can't hear the guys anymore. For me there was no clear hit at all on this cd. Michael's sweet clear voice is gone. The girls sing most of the leads and I really miss the guys. The best songs are the ones that the guys sing the lead on. I use to be able to pick out the individual voices of the singers. I can't do that anymore. They are sound alike. I think they really need to get Michael back. Greg can stay too but we really need Michael back.
2,Dull and dissapointing,"For me the classic Avalon album was ""A MAZE OF GRACE,"" but their recordings have been steadily going downhill ever since. They have been placing too much emphasis on the ballads, and not enough on the uptempo material that allows them to stand out.I don't think the band has ever recovered from the loss of Nikki Hassman. She had a distinct voice and delivery, but her replacements have been bland and lack her mojo.The songs on Creed are very average and bordering on the dull side and the harmonies are not as well thought out as in the past.If you're a fan, then by all means purchase this. If not, this would not be your best introduction to a once excellent group."
3,The more I listen to this the more I love it,"The four vocalists are each very talented, but would sound better individually than together. I think Greg is very talented and has a great voice, but he can never replace Michael. Their sound is a little different, but their music is very catchy and I love all of the songs. I miss the sound of the original members, Michael and Cherie. Michael had the voice of an angel--a gift from God that tugged at my heartstrings, and Cherie had such a soothing tone to her voice. I do agree with other reviewers about the inablility to recognize who is singing. I noticed this at first, but the more I listen to the album the more I can differentiate the voices. The harmonies and personalities are not as clear and crisp as they were on the previous albums, but this is still one of my favorite albums to listen to, and I will continue to be a fan and support them and their ministry as long as they keep their fire burning for the Lord!"
1,Not good,"Like Helen, I've followed Avaloln for nearly 10 years since their debut at the New Young Messiah Tour. Although the group has had somewhat of a revolving door with great voices like Nikki Hassman, Cherie Paliotta, and Michael Passons leave, they've managed to maintain each album's integrity throughout. That is until Creed.I listened to the CD in its entirety and was ready to scrap it for another one. The vocals were par for the course and overproduced. The energy and inspiration of their music just seemed to be lacking. I'll be awaiting the next release to make sure this just wasn't one bad blip.Faithfully yours,Trey"
1,Not their Best.,"I like some of their songs but nothing really stood out on this for me musically. I just couldnt get into it at all. I even think the cover is a little funny with the whole ""Matrix"" look. Wouldnt recommend it but if you are an Avalon fan it maybe worth checking out."
5,Avalon is still great!,"This was really the first Avalon CD I bought and I liked it immediately. Since then, I have purchased most of the older Avalon ones, and I think they still sound the same. Really, I can't tell the difference.My favorite song has to be You Were There. I loved it the minute I heard it.All of the songs have a classic Avalon delivery and I love it.Don't be skeptical about this CD, Avalon still is TOPS!!!!"
1,Their Worst One.,"Some of these 5 star recommendations look like they came straight from their marketing department. Their CD ""A Maze of Grace"" will give you a better idea of what kind of sound they can produce. With the exception of the first track ""All"", it sounds like a mediocre show of American Idol. It doesn't flow. Their first track ""All"" is what their older CD's sound like."
5,Irish Tea,"This tea is for real tea lovers who like a smooth no frills robust black leaf tea. I have found Barry's of Cork to exceed my expectations for a wonderful relaxing experience. Make a pot. What you don't drink hot, it's excellent iced."
4,its a far departure from PG,"barrys is bold, rich, and astringent. definitely blended to be cut with milk and sugar, but works better than coffee to get you out of bed in the morning. this isnt PG tips by a longshot."
1,"Should be called ""Paltry Snippets""; What a bad disk","What a misleading disk. It is not ""super hits"", but 2-5 minute sections of of these works. Do NOT buy this disk if you love the pieces that are on it. It will only make you wonder ""where'd the rest of the cut go?"" MAYBE there are 25 minutes of music total on this whole disk, chopped up into soundbytes. Copeland is rolling over in his grave."
2,Too little music,"All of 'Fanfare for the Common Man' and 'El Salón México' are here, but only one of eight (1 of 8) movements of 'Appalachian Spring', two of seven (2 of 7) movements of 'Billy the Kid', (2 of 4) two of four movements of 'Rodeo', and about half of 'Lincoln Portrait'.The entire CD has just over 36 minutes of music, about half of what a CD can contain. Although the performances are fine, this CD really isn't worth its price."
4,Never a Dead Issue,"A little on the old side now (1992) The Dead Sea Scrolls After Forty Years is a nice little overview of the history of the Scrolls: their discovery, their origin, their translation, and the contention over their intellectual ""ownership."" The slender volume is a printed version of a symposium conducted at the Smithsonian Institute and given by three prominent scholars (Vanderkam, McCarter, and Sanders) and introduced and moderated by Hershel Shanks, the founder, editor and publisher of Biblical Archaeology Review among other periodicals. The book is divided into four sections, the last three followed by a question and answer session, themselves very informative. The lectures reveal that the process of Biblical textual analysis is always a work in progress--and that what is extracted reflects as much on the evolution of our modern society as on the ancient one. An interesting little book."
4,It's Worth It,"I never heard of Tom Russell until I heard him on a local radio station during a fundraiser. If you like Tex-Mex, you will like this recording. ""Touch of Evil"" and ""The Next Thing Smokin'"" are really great songs. I'm gonna' save up for another CD by this guy. Tasty guitar and accordian licks abound."
5,Great Shoe!,"I had bought a previous pair of Lelli Kelly shoes (a sneaker style) at a discount store and my daughter loved them. The beads and sequins held up really well, and she never complained about comfort. She is now going through a phase where she is very particular about shoes and comfort, and these are one of two pairs of shoes that she will actually wear. I was lucky when I purchased these shoes on Amazon because they were running a sale on the brand so I only paid about $[...]. To be honest I don't think I would have paid more than that for a pair of shoes for a 4 year old (but that's just me). But again, they have held up very well. They are easy for her to take on and off and they are shiny and sparkly and perfect for a very girly girl who also likes to play rough and get dirty."
4,Good movie,I remember that I enjoyed this movie when I first saw it. I have only seen it the once and thought the performances were good. You cannot make a historically correct movie based on events that happened over 400 hundred years ago. Personally I cannot make a judgement on Anne Boleyn's character without knowing her. I think that most people living in that era by todays standards would be considered inhumane and barbaric. I have read many books about her and we all like to recreate our own Anne Boleyn.I enjoyed the interpretation of this Anne very much.
5,Anne of the Thousand Days,Please please please please put this on a DVD. My VHS is about watched out. This is such a good film and it is a shame that we do not have access to it as a DVD.
3,"good, but innaccurate","A very well-acted movie, but not very historically accurate. Makes Anne Boelyn out to be a saint, when she wasn't even close, but when did Hollywood ever let a thing like accuracy get in the way of a historic movie? Worth watching though."
4,Hello,"Well, I watched this movie for history. I found nothing especially good about it, except for the fact that ann boylin, was played very well in this movie. Umm, I think that's about all I am going to say on this matter. Good bye, and have a nice day."
4,Very Good Acting,"Due to my internet connection speed, it was a little difficult to watch on line. This will not keep me from purchasing the DVD."
4,awesome !,Very dramatic and realistic! acting was awesome! Historically accurate too! Richard Burton potrayed henryvii extremely well! genieve played anne well too.
4,Grows on you,"I used to really hate this one for all the inaccuracies it contained. Then, as the years went by, I mellowed out and also saw some truly terrible adaptations of this same material. Every time I see this one, I like it more. The story of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn is inherently melodramatic, and so easy to get wrong. This film hits the mark far more often than it misses. It looks great, is cast superbly and tells an engaging, well-paced story. Yes, some license is taken (Katharine of Aragon is once again a dark, accented Spaniard, Thomas More isn't permitted to make his famous scaffold speech, Mary Boleyn is portrayed as ""fallen"" and abandoned, divorce was in fact common among 16th century nobility, etc.), and I still say that what 20th century writers invent often isn't as interesting as the real thing. Still, there's enough here to make it well worth the full purchase price, and it even tugs at the ol' heartstrings in a way few historical dramas do. Recommended!"
4,Entertaining,"This is a nice movie about Henry VIII and offers more depth than the 1933 film about him. It focuses on the first three wives (with Anne as the centerpiece) but Catherine of Aragon plays a sizeable role in this film, and Jane Seymour appears later on.The actress for Anne did a nice job with the role and the story itself is fairly well-written. The costumes and backgrounds are visually pleasing, and while this story has a few historical inaccuracies, it is definitely a lot more accurate than the 1933 film. My favorite scene is near the end where Anne gets all fired up and vows that her daughter will be a good ruler (and it did come true) The dynamics between the actor and actress who played Henry and Anne worked out quite well for this film."
3,Repackaging defies logic...,The first track of this album -- the Malotte Lord's Prayer -- is NOT the version which was on the original album which contained the other 10 tracks. This version of the Lord's Prayer was the final track in Volume 2 of the Lord's Prayer recorded by the Choir a few years later (1962).The original Lord's Prayer album -- the one with the wheat on the front cover -- went GOLD in 1963 (5 years after release) and is probably the most popular non-Christmas album the Choir ever recorded. So WHY didn't Sony just give us a release of that Gold Album with the original jacket AND with the Robertson Lord's Prayer for which the original album was named?Those thousands who loved the original LP also loved the opening track.
2,Butter Bell Butter Holder,"Cute, but not very functional. After a couple of days the butter had black mold when left out of the refrigerator - even after changing the water daily!"
1,Not so exciting,"Neither my baby, nor I like this animation movie. Hopefully, my baby will like it while he grows."
5,For the money...awesome,"I am a rank beginner on the guitar so instead of going out and buying a cheap strat I opted for this all in one package (got it all for 105 at BJ's). My neighbour is a guitar veteran and helped me adjust the action and I adjusted the intonation. This guitar is pretty sweet! My only complaint is the amp (it's a 15W Fender brand) hums a bit every now and then, it's not the guitar or the cable (as almost everyone claims) it is the amp. I'm not complaining because if I have the amp volume at 3 or above the hum isn't noticeable."
3,"""planned obsolescence""",The tuner broke first. The cord shorted out. The amp plug malfunctioned. The guitar plays fine. I don't in anyway abuse the equipment. Buy the parts separately and save time and money.
3,awfully small,"A puppet theatre is a wonderful educational toy. The kids love making their own plays up and sometimes I will have them do one on a history story, very educational and the kids really enjoy it which makes the history stick. The only problem is this toy is very small ( I didn't realize the puppets would be finger puppets) and a little flimsy. I can't let the kids just play with is because they will surely break it. So I have to set it up for them. I wish I had seen the big inflatable one before purchasing this. we would have bought that and then just left it up for the kids."
4,This book should have 2 ratings.,This book should have 2 ratings. One rating for die hard fans (5 stars) and another for those with a casual interest (2 stars). It is a very short book it is padded by using large text and reproducing on every second page Chet's diary entries as the appeared in his note book. It is a nice package but really only for a genuine fan. I greatly enjoyed the book myself but I would be reluctant to reccomend it to the casual reader.
1,"BUY CHET'S CDs, ANY OF THEM...","I bought this book when it came out. couldn't wait. read it, wanted to slit my wrist and shoved it away! Re-read the thing recently and my opinion hasn't changed. You'll be inclined to take up smoking (or start again!), or some other balm after this relentless 'downer.' I wish I had bought a CD of Chet's I don't already have instead. After all, the MUSIC IS THE MAN, and, my God! what music. Mr. Baker's unique ability -- from the depths of abuse, desperation and excess -- IS HIS BIOGRAPHY, his legacy, and his brilliance. Don't read, just listen, close your eyes, and be transported!"
3,"Not funny, valentine","It has always been a puzzle to me how an artist with the originality of Chet Baker, tries, and finally succeds, in destroying his talent and then himself;not necessarily in that order.I just ordered Jeroen de Valk's book. I hope it gives me a more balanced perspective of Baker, who's music makes me smile and cry at the same time........"
1,Kindle errors.,"The Kindle edition is full of hyphenation errors, presumably left over from the hardcover. Words which were hyphenated in the hardcover are hyphenated in the Kindle edition, even when they don't appear at the end of a line. Very frustrating, and keeps taking me out of the story."
3,"Great size, but had issues...","I had been searching far and wide for a holding tank for my fat tailed gecko who needs length and width, not height. I was very excited when I got this, but when I took it out, I noticed that instead of being black and clear like the photo, it was tinted orange with a dark forest green lid. I tried to convince myself that it was something I could live with as I have already had several issues with previous products I had ordered like hide outs and food dishes, but once I found the crack in the side I had to send it back. Replacement is on it's way and I hope they send the right color this time. I'll write again once I get the new one. Hope the color issue was just with that one and isn't with their entire stock."
5,Kant no longer being Published,"News was received today that Kantcentrum is closing and that Kant will no longer be published. Efforts are underway to keep the school going, but the future is uncertain at this point."
5,andre at his best,not much to say about this album except that its a master piece couldnt find it in any stores so i ordered it a must have for the nickitina fans out there

5,Whether You From The Bay Or Not...,"This is raw. Nickatina's second album. Don't care if you like it or not, I rep Andre all day. It's 2008 and I'm still bumpin' his REAL RAP MUSIC. Anybody that didn't give this a 5-star is out of their mind. Just maybe Nicky's best album. A must have for sure."
5,best frisco rap cd ever,this is the best rap cd I have ever bought. better than any other of my 500 rap cds. better that all sac town rap. andre really came out and blew a lot of minds with this. Killin of the caine is possibly the best rap cd of all time. BUY THIS AND ALL OF ANDRE NICKATINA'S OTHER CD'S
5,Sucka Free,"Dre Dog is pure uncut dope! I own some Nickatina Albums too, but under the name Dre Dog he flowed best and the beats were better than. So if u don`t have this CD yet: GO OUT AND GET IT!!! I promise u sucka free music from tha sucka free!!!"
2,It's not worth it,I bought this after havinf the Belkin Tunecast II and have to say that i cannot see any improvement. The signal is TOO WEAK....TOOOOOOO WEAK.
1,Worthless,"This product, despite claims, does not work with iPod Video version 5.5 with the latest firmware/software. I went through two separate, brand-new units and neither worked. Don't buy it."
2,"Sound quility, there is none","I was completely let down by this product. From what I read it was supposed to be a great tool to get your IPOD to play music over the radio in your car. After searching almost every station for better reception, none worked with crisp clear sound that would come from tuning into a radio station. Lots of static, thats about all I got. Waste of money! I will update my car stereo with a input jack instead of wasting more money on a similar solution."
2,I was hoping for more,"After reading several reviews of the TuneFM, I was excited about the prospect of listening to my iPod Nano in my car. But I've been pretty disappointed by the product's quality. Even when I can find a frequency that is interference-free, the quality of the sound is pretty bad. Not even FM-quality, in my opinion. Maybe I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up."
5,Great Product!,"This is the best Ipod FM tuner I have found. The clarity through the car radio is very good Previous ones I have purchased have had various levels of constant static as part of the function. With this Belkin F8Z075 the static is only momentary, and that when going througha particular challenging reception area."
5,Just what I needed!,"What can't I say about this item. It's what every iPod needs. Tune to any free station on the dial, 4 presets and wireless! I love it!"
4,Good all around FM Mod.,"Good product. signal sometimes not great, but usually good. when using it's scan feature, easier to find a good station. works good in my wife's Santa Fe, not as well in my Explorer as I had hoped. I can use it in the house, and in the garage. also handy that it's a mini USB connection, as I can use other chargers to power/charge the unit."
2,Perfect for tunnels,"it's a super idea, but i cannot say it works well. getting a free station is a real challenge, even in the underdeveloped Italy. and if you get one, but you are driving, within 5 minutes (or 5 miles) you lose the signal... however the sound is perfect when you enter into a tunnel.is not good for cars, but works at home, connecting it to the radio. it needs to be improved."
2,does NOT work with ipod touch!,"I'm sure this is a nice product, but unfortunately I haven't been able to use mine because, even though Amazon says under their technical information that this transmitter works with the touch, when I received mine, I realized that was not the case. I had to send it back.Not a bad review for the product, because I don't know what it's like - just don't buy it for your touch because it won't work.:O)"
1,Not very good at all!!!!!,"The web site I was directed to by the seller didn't have a product description for this product on its site. You have to figure out how to work it yourself. When you do get it working, you have to turn your ipod a certain way to get rid of the terrible static that drowns out the music you're playing and hope your ipod doesn't move a hair while you're driving or the static will come back. AVOID THIS PRODUCT LIKE THE PLAGUE. SPEND MORE MONEY TO BUY A BETTER ONE THAT WORKS PROPERLY!!! I prevoiusly had a Belkin FM transmitter for my ipod mini that had small PVC like conections to my cigarette lighter and that worked great. I guess Belkin can't always get it right.I didn't want to give this product any star rating but Amazon won't let my product review through unless I give it at least 1 star."
4,Wear and Tear,"Initially, this product worked awesome. I found that it didn't work as well in some cars, but in my little Volkswagen, it was fine. HOWEVER, over time, the charging portion of the wiring seemed to die. I did leave the charger in my car (temps ranged from 120 degrees to 0 degrees), but I never abused the charger or the transmitter. I decided to purchase another model to test other brands, but I would still highly recommend this model. Just be warned that it's charging bits might die...for some unknown reason."
4,Ok,"Great at first with the audio quality, over time...I heard static but I can tell a difference between a Non-brand Cable and a Sony!"
2,Wish it was compatible with more Sony products,"Bought this item in hopes of working with my Sony headphones MDR-NC50- and it doesn't. Sony should make all their parts that connect to their products universally compatible to avoid confusion when purchasing. Also, they should make it so their cords don't wear out. Obviously, the cord gets a lot of use and is handled a lot, very susceptible to wear and tear. They should use different, more hearty materials to create these products. I spent over $200 for the headphones and virtually no sound came out after the cord wore off.Other than these manufacturer concerns, the item is fine. Cord is very thick and strong. Product came to my house very quickly and price was right. Unfortunately, I can't use the item."
5,works great,I bought this for my husband so he can listen to his favorite music in the car. He loves it. It does everything it is supposed to do.
4,A Keeper,"These selected poems of Wang Wei are translated by David Hintonbeautifully. After reading his, others translations seem pale."
5,Coherent attempt to explain results of past life therapies.,"Most books on past lives are mostly anecdotal, depending for their interest on the reader's being amazed that the evidence for them exists. Bache's book, however, goes beyond that to attempt a coherent theory of what happens between lives, and whether there is a pattern to one's lives.I thought this was the most important book in this field that I have read in 10 years. There is still a lot to be explained, but I found much of what Bache says very convincing. A good book to begin with if you have read nothing else - he mentions all the important work in the field so you can explore further."
2,Too much philosophical meanderings,"I was very impressed by first two chapters where author presents evidence for reincarnation but starting with 3rd chapter, writing becomes speculative in earnest with highly questionable concepts like ""karmic scripts"", ""the oversoul"" and ""the other life"" AFTER death and BEFORE birth. What a disappointment!I consider reincarnation a fact of nature but have very hard time with this kind of over-the-top extrapolative contemplations."
1,Only one good song,"I had hoped for a reasonable variety of songs to play as background music for a Halloween party, and this was a real disappointment."
4,Brings back memories,"Any real Mexicanos or Chicanos can feel this album. It's got a firme vibe to it, classic gangsta. They did'nt get any recognition back then around my hood, but we played on a Friday Night to deaf ! The cd's good but not perfect, what's perfect is a B.Q / house party South STL-mi barrio."
5,bravo! <clap> <clap> <clap> <clap>,"In a world where the comic pages have become increasing trite and bland, Mr. Tatulli's Heart of the City is both a surprise and a delight. The characters (Heart, her Mom, her friends) are complex and funny, but most of all believable. No other comic characters are more alive than Heart of the City's, and this first book refects that.Not since early Watterson (Calvin & Hobbes) and early Amend (Foxtrox) have I been this pleased with a comic book.This one is a winner. Don't miss it."
3,Their new CD is much better!,"I bought this EP last year and thought it was pretty good, but nowhere near the quality of their Hoarse - ""Happens Twice"" album from 1997. I just went looking to see if there was a new album out by The Fags and stumbled across their MySpace page. Their new album came out on July 25, 2006, and is available only on iTunes currently. And it is as incredible as the Hoarse album -- Highly recommended!"
5,I DID NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF IT BUT LIKED IT,"This is certainly a wonderfully written book. I cannot agree with all of the author's opinions, nor his historical data, but he does make some good points and the book is well worth the read. It gives a point of view from the farmer's side, always a good thing, but that being said, it must also be noted that the author needs to face reality. I do recommend this one though and will probably read it again myself. A good one to add to your collection. Thank you Mr Hanson."
5,LIL ROB IS MY PAPI CHULO,LIL ROB IS THE BEST RAPER U COULD EVER HEARD!!! HE'S #1 OF ALL RAPERS. ALL YA THAT DONT BUY MY VATO CD ARE STUPID! LIL ROB IS DOWN FOR THE BROWN PRIDE AND FOR ALL LA RAZA THAT LIVES HERE IN SAN DIEGO. ALL THE SONGS IN THIS CD ARE FIRME!!! I REATE HIM WITH A 5 STAR. I LOVE U MIJO!!
4,"""Crazy Life""","This is one of the most talented rappers I've listened to in a long time. He mixes BTNH' chorus-like rhymes with Eminem's rapid fire verses. At times he's talking about just wanting to be with his girl and the next he's doing the girl of the vato he just knocked off. The album does lack in production creativity. There are about 3 or 4 songs that are really great in both beats and words, but most are just o.k. He does get down for the brown and tries to represent San Diego with love in most of the songs. Lil Rob is a diamond in the rough and is just waiting to get the exposure he deserves. You need to buy this album just so you can hear for yourself the talent that this Latino rapper has."
5,SUPP,"DANM WELL WHAT DO i SAY , LIL ROB IS THE BEST RAPPER IVE HEARD, HE HAS THE BEST FLOWS ...THIS CD IS TIGHT ..ALLL HIS CDS ARE TIGHT ...BABYDOLL"
5,One of the best reads of my year...,"The Memory Book by Penelope Stokes -The Memory Book is a tragic story of family secrets and how those secrets affect the generations to follow. What I loved about this novel was how intricately Ms. Stokes linked family members to each other though their paths never crossed. I literally gasped aloud at the twist in this plot. Everything in this novel fits perfectly together, making it one of the best reads of my year.-Traci DePree, author of A Can of Peas"
1,Predictable and Corny,"I just finished up this book for my book club, so will try very hard to be objective. Here were my biggest issues with the book:1. The plot was transparent, I could have told you exactly what was going to happen from about page 30.2. The dialogue was painful and contrived, not at all natural.3. The main character has some serious questions about and issues with God - understandably, considering her circumstances. However, by the end of the book, it's all better. People who have that many issues with their higher being don't just get past them.This is possibly the worst book I've read this year. It was painful and trite. So disappointed that I wasted my time on it."
3,NMW,What ever happened to this group? Are they in prison? Dead? Not trying to be funny - just curious. Great CD from the old days.
1,I received my cd package incomplete; only one CD of two.,This CD is two cd's set and is incomplete and the case is scrashed it. I am very dissatisfied. with this purchase.
3,"Does the job, but pricey for what it is.","The razor requires cleaning with the manufacturer's product, but the cleaner's ingredient label reveals that it is 98% alcohol with a touch of jojoba oil and fragrance. Pretty pricey for something that's almost entirely alcohol. I think I'll try my own mix next time."
1,Not what I ordered.,"I ordered the cleaning solution cc-100 but I received cc-100A. I received the cc-100 solution when I bought my shaver and it worked fine but when I needed more I tried to order the same solution. I ordered this under the impression that it was the same (it didn't have the ""A"" after the product number in the info) and it was not. I figured it was ""close enough"" when I got it so I tried it. It was not even close!!!! It made a gooey blue mess all over my shaver that was hell to try to clean off. I put it in the cleaner and ran it but didn't pull it out until the next day so it was no longer liquid, it had dried and made it even harder to try to clean off.Double check the product when you get and don't settle for ""close enough"". I do not recommend this if you are looking for the ""real"" cc-100 solution."
4,"Good phones, I'm spoiled by our shrinking electronics","The sound quality on these headphones is pretty much what you would expect from Sony for this price, i.e., not spectacular but good treble, slightly less good bass. To be honest, if you're jogging, you'd hardly notice unless you're used to awesome sound all the time.My only problem with these is the problem with all stiff-headband headphones; if you have a small electronic device (MD or MP3 player) the headphones can't be crammed wherever you put the device (unless you're willing to break your new headphones, which I negligently have done).So, good for the sound, not as portable as the playing devices of the 21st century."
3,"A little small, but serves the purpose","I found the item to be a little small and not very high quality, but my granson is very happy with it."
1,Stopped working after 3 uses,"Avoid this one. Broke down after 3 uses, even though the appliance connected to it was well within the tolerance limit. Any returns are basically impossible with this seller (enormous set of conditions and they do not take back faulty merchandise), so we are basically stuck with a very very heavy piece of junk."
2,It has quit working for me after a couple of months.,"I used this for my pressure rice cooker I ve got from Korea.it was working fine the whole time.then it just quit working.I dint see it happen. I put the rice in and click the cook button and it just quit working.the fuse is fine, i am not dumb.its EXTREMELY heavy. I flew all the way from San Francisco to Seattle with this. and now it s just heavy piece of junk.I dont think its a good item but i paid 60 bucks for it, i think i should get some kinda warranty for it but i dont see how this piece would work again. I dont know how I would use my rice cooker anymore.its heavy duty then it should work almost forever but it only lasted me a couple of months. oh well."
1,No good !,"Spent almost $200 after shipping for these, took them all the way to Romania and fried two things including my MacBook pro charger...I bought two of these and both were the sameDon't buy"
4,Still applicable,"Despite being published over 18 years ago, this book manages to convey a useful methodology. That's quite a feat, considering that the PC was only just being introduced!The book lays out a step-by-step set of procedures for documentation development. The prefece boldly declares, ""MIS professionals can produce effective documentation by following the Documentation Development Methodology."" Although the book can be applied to anything from an quick-installation guide to a full-blown user manual, the primary focus is on producing manuals.I've used the book and I'm quite pleased with the results."
3,Okay for its price.,"I got this wheel about four months ago and it broke a few days back. It was pretty loud, especially toward the end of its life, but three of my four female rats really enjoyed it and for the price I'm not complaining. I'm not going to purchase the product again (I'm opting for a more expensive, sturdier, quiet wheel) but again, considering the price, I don't regret buying it in the first place. I had it attached to the cage at first but that was much too loud so I moved it to the stand and it was considerably quieter, though still obnoxious. It served its purpose for about four months."
3,Good despite shipping damage,"Arrived with two of the four brackets broken (probably due to shipping), so was in alright shape after some superglue. Hedgehog loves it otherwise, but will have to see how well it holds up considering."
1,My chin doesn't like it...,"Personally I had this spinner in my chin's home/cage for 45days and she never used it. Chins are supposed to prefer what is known as the ""Flying Saucer"" as it doesn't arch their back."
2,Chinny Chinny Bang Bang,"I know, the title's pretty lame, but then...I'm not so fond of the wheel, either. When my chinchilla gets running, this wheel starts BANGING, and it doesn't matter if I have it attached to the cage wall or the stand. It's a pretty flimsy construction, and of course as others have said, plastic and chinchillas don't make a healthy combination anyway (but it was the only thing my pet store had, so I decided to try it out anyway). I can't give any good substitutions, unfortunately, since I'm still looking for one myself. All I know is that this wheel is certainly NOT a very silent spinner!"
3,"Rats love it, we don't.................","From the moment I put this in the cage, our two rats loved it. The problems I have with it are: it is solid plastic and gets filthy very quickly - apparently from the stuff on their feet............ secondly, after only two weeks, it appears that the shaft holding the wheel has worn or become loose that has made the ""Silent Spinner"" not so silent any more. I need to see if this is just the screw holding the wheel that can be tightened or if it is in fact worn."
1,Awful wheel,"This wheel is not silent, nor is it appropriate for a chinchilla of any real size. It bounces around the cage when she is on it as it is not heavy enough to stay in place when used. It also cracked after 3 days of use, just from the chinchilla. Avoid this."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,This wheel is not even close to silent whether it's on the stand or mounted to the cage. It wobbles so much that it throws my rat out of the wheel and creates an incredibly loud thunderous sound that shakes the entire cage regardless of how it's mounted. It's a horrible product and to save you time and money just don't buy this.
4,Silent for lightweights,"I have 2 Silent Spinners - a large and a little one for my 2 robo hamsters. They are very light and love to use the large spinner together! They get going so fast - invariably one or sometimes both of them gets tossed out ... and then they get right back on and spin-spin-spin! The smallest size is perfect for this type of hammie - one at a time however! It is very quiet. It doesn't seem to work as well with my larger teddy bear hamster tho - it bounces and bangs up against the cage wall - and because it is opaque, she's a little hesitant on the wheel. I bought her a large fine mesh wheel - oiled it with just a touch of vegetable oil and watch her go nearly as fast (and quiet)as my robos."
3,wheel for my hedgehog,The size of the wheel is great. It has started to make a thumping noise when my hedgehog runs on it. That makes it not as silent as I would like but still a good product.
2,Stinks! (literally),"This wheel is quiet and safe. However, it gets really stinky and messy really quickly. My mice ""go"" even when they're running on the wheel, so waste collects on the wheel. I'm buying a traditional wire wheel to replace it."
3,BIG wheel goes round...mostly,"I bought this item as it was advertised as being ""silent"". Well, that's not true. I think silent is an absolute term, not a comparative one. And this wheel, although pretty quiet, is not silent by any means. And the thing about it being so big is that it's not true. It leans from the axis due to its weight so when my rat runs in it, it wobbles. And it the centrifugal force tends to push her out.I'm no vet or even a rat-ologist, but I think that running in a wobbly wheel can't be the best thing for her.I did, as another reviewer mentioned, put the stand on the wheel as well as attach it to the side of the cage. That decreased the wobble factor a lot, though by no means altogether."
2,cheap plastic,"I've bought 2 of these wheels for my chinchillas. The stand that comes with it is not sturdy enough to support the running weight of a chin or guinea pig - when they get going the wheel falls over scaring them half to death. You can also fasten the wheel to the side of the cage, but I found it hard to tighten the nut enough to keep the wheel from wobbling. AND - both times - the chinchillas were able to chew off the interior fastener and break the wheel within 2 weeks. I ended up getting them a metal wheel which has lasted over a year now."
1,Not Big Enough for Chinchilla,"I got this wheel for my chinchilla, who is 3 years old, and it is simply not big enough for him. I did research on it that really said even a 14"" was too small bc it hurts their backs but this was all they had in the bet store :/ Do not buy for chinchilla, spend the extra money and get him an 18"" wheel. Chin will be much much happier :)"
2,Loud!!!,"Though the wheel spins silently on the stand, the whole unit bounces around so much that, while the chinchilla is using it, it's way too loud. The flying saucer is much quieter."
1,Bad design all around,"First off, this is considered a Chinchilla wheel. Had it been labeled a hamster, gerbil, or rat wheel, it may have gotten more than 1 star. Even the largest (12 inch) wheel is TOO SMALL FOR CHINCHILLAS. It makes them bend their backs unnaturally. Another major problem: it's plastic. You should NEVER buy anything plastic for a chinchilla, they will chew on it and ingesting it can make them sick or kill them.Take my word, I've been a chinchilla owner for more than 8 years, I have done my homework and know a lot just from personal experience, this wheel is NOT safe for chinchillas. Your best bet is to spend a little more and get a wheel that will last for a lifetime. The 2 best are Chin Spins and Flying Saucers, both are available at Quality Cage."
2,Good at first then broken,"I got this wheel about 2 months ago and in the time I had it it was not balanced at all and every other day I would have to pick it up and set it up right for my chinchilla. When he would run on it it tilted and made him run sideways. Along with that it is more silent than a wire wheel but not quiet in the least. I can hear it squeaking from the other room. And about two months after I bought it, it snapped and the plastic cut jaggedly off of the center component. It could have seriously injured my chinchilla if it got its leg caught. I do not recommend buying this for how expensive it is.Super Pet Chinchilla 12-Inch Giant Silent Spinner Exercise Wheel, Colors Vary"
1,Super Pet Chincilla 12 inch Giant Silent Spinner,I have not received the item as of yet. The first order I had to send back because the wheel was cracked.
1,"""Good"" quality","I bought a used wheel, and in the description I read the wheel was in ""good"" condition. I was really disappointed to find out that good condition was a crack right down the middle of the wheel; I didn't know a broken wheel constituted for ""good"" quality. But overall it remained true to its description, I just taped up the wheel but i know i'll have to buy a new one in a couple months."
3,Economical Wheel,"The wheel is somewhat sturdy. It allows you take the base off so you can have free floating in the cage using the knob on the back which locks it into the mesh. This is my 3rd wheel. They are made of plastic and with a decent amount of pressure they will crack and since it's a hard plastic pieces break off in chunks and the wheel is no longer usable. Also i have had the bearings wear out on me prematurely and they make an awful squeak sound. Nothing you can't fix with a little DW-40, but make sure you don't get it in the cage and your Chin can't reach the bearings because they WILL try and eat them. I don't have the money nor do I want to spend $120 on the nice balanced metal ones that supposedly last forever. So as the title says this is an ""economical wheel"" that lasts for a good 4 to 5 months then most likely needs replacing. If your buying it on Amazon vs. Petco or another pet store it tends to be not as pricey and you don't have to worry about Petco actually stocking it."
3,Not as pictured,"I received my package on time, but when i opened the box there was no metal wire. The wheel works fine but the way our chinchilla hops in it makes it far from silent. At night i have to take it off to sleep. Think it would be fine with the wire, but i did not receive one"
2,NOT Silent at all,"I bought this wheel at the local pet store and thought it would be great for my chinchilla. It does indeed work well, but I found out that chinchillas like to RUN! Over time, as other reviews have stated, it has gotten very noisy. This is undoubtedly sustained from the hopping that chinchillas do when they run. I've had to tie it down to the cage bottom so that it won't be bouncing up and down and create more noise. It is so loud I can not hear the t.v. at night (in the same room) over the noise.If you get this for a chinchilla it will be good exercise source temporarily. I'd invest in a metal wheel, though, as chinchillas need something a bit sturdier than plastic to run in."
3,hmmm,"so, i like this wheel because i feel that it is safe for their little feets and tails (hamsters) but i dunno- mine is NOT silent. its not squeaky and annoying like the metal ones can be, but its certainly not silent. i tried adjusting where it was placed in the cage, but i hear it. doesnt bother me much though. it is a nice sturdy safe wheel"
2,"It is wobbly, loud, and hard to clean","If you just use the stand, this wheel is wobbly as hell. My hedghoge spins it loose every single night-I wake up, the the wheel is on the floor of the cage with the screw that holds it in place lost in the bedding. The damn thing is loud on account of how wobbly is. My hedghhoge has actually learned to spin for a while one way, flip around and start spinning the other way just so that the wheel doesn't pop-out! Again I am sure if I go out and buy the lug-knot and bolt it to the cage some how, it might work like it's suppose to.. Considering I payed like 25$ for it and it comes with a damn stand I just expected it to work without further hassle. The cleaning sucks as well, we all know hedghogs like to poop when they run - outcome is disastrous, after 1 night the wheel looked like I hadn't been cleaned in months and it was gonna take a lot of elbow grease to clean it up."
1,Arrived in Bad Condition,"The wheel itself works well with our chinchilla, and we eventually ended up purchasing it at our local pet store. However, the problem when we ordered it from Amazon is that it arrived with a main piece missing (making it useless). The item also appeared to be used before (even though we bought it new)."
4,Great Wheel,"Best wheel I bought so far and hopefully will be the last brand I try. I've tried Wodent Wheels, which my rats quickly learned how to take apart and chew on. I also couldn't get them mounted on my cages (I breed rats so need several wheels for my Martin's Cages). We also were given a Comfort Wheel from Super Pet which was great free standing on my play table, but put it in a cage and the wheels constantly falls off the flimsy stand. So far the Silent Spinners are the most functional and resiliant. My only semi-complaint is that they shake a bit when the girls really get going on them but they don't seem to mind!"
4,Not that silent,"We had a few accidents with wire wheels(tails were getting caught up) so we decided to opt for a plastic one. Our rats love this wheel however its not really silent. Another downside to it is messiness...feces get trapped inside because of its design.But overall I am pretty happy, ordering another one for a baby hedgy."
3,Quiet but still has flaws,I purchased the silent spinner (7inch diameter) for my hamster. I have woken up twice already to find that the wheel came off the axle and toppled over. I made sure i screwed on the yellow knob tightly after the first incident but it happened again and this time it trapped my hamster inside the wheel when it fell over. I don't even want to think about how long my hamster was trapped in that cramped little space. I'm not sure if i can glue the knob down but i will have to make sure the knob is tightened every night.
3,IT SQUEAKS!,"Yes, this is a heacy duty wheel. Your hamster will not break this one. However, it squeaks like crazy. You may quiet it a bit with some oil, but it squeaks louder the the cheaper wheels rattle..."
5,I love the silent spinner.,"I love the silent spinner. I have two chinchillas and they also love it. This spinner wheel still makes noise, but nowhere near the amount of noise a traditional spinner wheel makes. This wheel is sturdy and attachs to the side of my ferret nation cage.I have had three different ones so far and this is the best. I started with the traditional wheel and it was noisey and actually broke. When it broke, it trapped one of my chins under it for the night. I also had the saucer. They wouldn't even use it. SO all and all, this is No. 1 to me. If I have to get another one, it will be this one.Marty"
2,Not very durable,"The middle screw has broke off in a matter of months. Not happy with the durability, I've gone through 3 or 4 of these."
3,Not good for Chinchillas.....,"Purchased two of these for my chinchillas, Chi Chi and Daisy. Both 12"" wheels broke and came off the cage within 10 minutes of my chinchilla running. The clip ""screw"" that attaches to the cage is not made very well and broke away from the wheel. The wheel itself is quiet compared to other wheels I have tried but the whole cage shook while my chinchilla was running on it. They did enjoy the wheel while they were able to use it. I glued the clip ""screw"" back onto the wheel and added some plastic zip ties to reinforce it. So far so good. Would not recommend for chinchillas....perfect for smaller lighter animals like hamsters."
4,Super Pet Silent Spinner,"The Super Pet Silent Spinners are amazing. They are so quiet! It's solid plastic, so it's not bad on your animal's little feet like the wire ones. However, if your animal goes to the bathroom it's a mess because it stays in the wheel. But they're pretty easy to take apart and clean. Also, if you have a heavier animal they wear out after a while and it will start squeaking a little bit, not too badly though. My hedgehog's lasted around 8 months before it gave out. However, they are well worth the money if you have a nocturnal animal. Even with its flaws it is still the best wheel."
1,Can't handle chin abuse,"My chin broke this in less than an hour, don't buy it for a chinchilla, it's a waste of money."
2,not enough power for large laptop,"Even though this power adapter says ""120W"", it cannot provide enough power for my Dell D800 laptop which requires a 90W power supply. This unit got hot and kept shutting off while I was in-flight. It may be sufficient for smaller laptops that do not require 90W, but for my purposes it was close to useless. I had to continuously unplug the device from the power port on the plane while my laptop was in my lap. This is a terribly awkward situation, especially when sitting in coach. I do not recommend this product if you need 90W supply. I bought this as a replacement for the CyberPower 150W DC-to-AC Adapter Model CPS150BI that I misplaced. I will buy another CPS150BI now."
4,An excellent examination,"This book is an incredible read, as the author does a fantastic job of introducing the reader to the myriad facets of life in the Frankish Empire of the 9th and 10th centuries. Everything from diet, prices, building styles, and social norms to the mechanics of how the state and church ran things. Frequent references to original documents really helps put things into perspective.My only quibble is that in many places terms are introduced but not defined. It's left to the reader to understand through context what is meant. I don't know if this was present in the original or was a problem in translation. Also readers should understand that this is not a traditional history. Aside from a timeline in the back, there is no attempt to tell the history of France from Charlemagne and his descendants. This book is solely a look at the world and the people.I mostly read history for pleasure and to get ideas for fantasy role-plying games. This work succeeded on both counts."
5,Simple and very didactic,"Step by step, this book guides you over all the aspects of the PCI bus: Architecture, transactions, arbitration, PCI commands, interrupts, configuration, etc.The book refers to both 33 and 66 MHz PCI.The book language is clear, the diagrams are good and the division by subjects is well done.At the beginning of every chapter, you can see a summary of the contents of the chapter, as well as a short sentence about the previous and next chapters.NOTE: I am a hardware designer, and I think that hardware issues were well covered in the book. As I have seen from previous reviews, software designers think that there is not enough information in the book for them. Also, as already noted by other reviewers, mechanical aspects are not covered by the book."
2,Not too different from the PCI Spec from PCI-SIG,"Hi,Bought this book under the assumption that the coverage would be better than the PCI Specification from PCI-SIG, but the book is pretty much an exact copy of the specification document. If you can get your hands on the original PCI spec., you will be better off. The only saving grace for this book was that it covered all the stuff from the spec., so if you don't have access to the spec., the book does an ok job covering the whole PCI area."
1,Software engineer,"I agree with other reviewers that said the book is not very helpful if you are writing a PCI device driver. It's full of register definitions and timing diagrams but I never got a feel for how to put it all together. This book may be useful for hardware designers but it is largely worthless for software engineers. If you're writing a driver and you want more info, don't waste your money here."
4,A good PCI reference,I really enjoyed the book. It has the technical detail and just the right amount of history.
2,It's plastic!!!!,It's Plastic! Don't use it near too much heat.. It either did not disclose it in the description or I missed it.
3,Wildly Inconsistent,"Paul McCartney once said that to like Wild Life, you had to be a fan of his. I'm a major fan of his but I still can't totally get into this album.This is the first Wings album, released in late 1971. They should have waited and produced a better album, but Paul wanted to see if he could record an album in two weeks. He could but not a good one...Still, even though much of it (""Dear Friend,"" ""I Am Your Singer"") isn't good, there is one brilliant song on it (""Some People Never Know""), and another pretty good one (""Tomorrow"").All in all, I'd agree with Paul in that it's just for fans. That doesn't guarantee that you'll like it but at least it makes you have one more album for your McCartney collection."
4,I Don't Understand The Negative Reviews,"Maybe I'm just sentimental, but this was the first McCartney album I ever owned. I have long since lost the vinyl, but thankfully the CD captures every note and more. I will admit it took me awhile to get used to the first track, but everything else is pure McCartney, for better or worse, and while I don't consider it his best work, it is certainly far from being his worst. ""Wings at the Speed of Sound"" as a whole, is definitely inferior to ""Wings Wild Life""I personally love this CD. But I guess it's a question of personal preference. And, I guess it's sentimental value does account for a great portion of my affection for this little known, and obviously misunderstood collection of tunes. I guess that's why I like it so much, they're really not much more than ""tunes"" but each one strike a chord in ME. And that's all that REALLY matters..."
3,A Decent Wings Debut,"Wings Wild Life is a decent debut by Paul McCartney's band Wings. It has an ""intimate-like"" quality that makes for comfortable listening.Highlights include the reggae influenced ""Love Is Strange"", the soft acoustic ballad ""Some People Never Know"", and the hidden gem of this album ""Tomorrow"".Some of the tracks sound like a jam session (""Mumbo"", Bip Bop), probably due to the fact that it was recorded and mixed in 2 weeks.The dark tracks on this album, ""Dear Friend"" (supposedly an answer to John Lennon's ""How Do You Sleep?"") and the title track are decent.The filler tracks (the little ""Link"" tracks, as well as ""I am Your Singer"") are just what they are ""Filler"".I found the only bonus track that was interesting was the rocking ""Give Ireland Back To The Irish"".All in all not a superb piece, but an interesting album to listen to once and a while."
3,"With a little editing, this could have been better","This is not a bad album. Some songs are good as is, some are just too long, such as I Am Your Singer (which also has some out of tune guitars in the solo). What is missing is the other three saying ""make this song shorter,"" or ""this song is crap."" Mr. McCartney has no filter in this album and it shows."
4,Most underrated McCartney's work,"why so many people don't like this one?it is much better than ""McCartney"" (his first solo album) and very interesting.the title track along with ""Dear friend"" and ""Tomorrow"" are far much better than half-baked ideas like ""Kreen a-akore"",""Lovely linda"" or ""Hot like sun"" from his debut that is overrated in my opinion.Paul's great bass playing and powerfull vocals are superb.even tracks like ""Mumbo"" or ""Bip bop"" that are naive are still containing that specific paul's style that will make you sing them after a while (although screams from ""Mumbo"" are heavy to sing...)anyway,i heard many bad opinions and i was thinking a while before i decided to buy it - i was amazed how good it is - really if you are a beatless fan or if yuo just like paul you will surely love this.highly recomended!"
2,Weak debut from Macca,"One of the worst solo albums by an ex-Beatle (the other two are Harrison's Extra Texture and Lennon's horrible Sometime in New York City), Wild Life showed Paul casting about for direction and, without a foil, coming up with nothing. This album always sounded like it was recorded in a hurry (perhaps in time for their British tour).By comparison the weakest songs on Press to Play are classics. The absolute low point is Love is Strange. The one redeeming moment is McCartney's response to How Do YOu Sleep?. Dear Friend answers Lennon with a touch of compassion, but with an undercurrent of sarcasm every bit as cutting as Lennon's."
1,McCartney at his worst,"What an awful album. If this had been created by anyone else, it would have never sold. The album brags that it was put together in a couple of days and released. I guess Paul wanted to prove he could produce and sell garbage.Do any of these songs presently get air play? Of course not. What is the purpose of Bip Bop and Mumbo, two nonsense songs? And the title track, Wild Life, in my opinion, like other parts of this album, and Ram, is really a swipe at John Lennon after John had issed How Do You Sleep. At the time John was going around preaching about different causes (peace, British policy in Ireland, etc.) Paul thought this was stupid. The singing and lyrics of Wild Life are so bad, I believe he is making fun of John.This album stinks."
3,Audio DVD,"This is a good recording, very similar to the King Biscuit Live CD. But buyer beware: this is an Audio DVD, there are no video clips of the concert."
5,Cant Find It Anywhere,"This cd in my opinion is one of the best if not the best in the underworld record label. As a matter of fact this is one of the best rap albums ever made. Not just in chicano rap bcuz in that category they are the best for sure but in any kind of rap they are the best. My favorite songs on the album are-#1- Ordinary Day#4- Coastin#5- Freakin#8- Very Next Day#9- Float On#10- LostBut what pi$$es me off is that I cannot find this cd in any local stores here I have looked at so many and I was looking for the cd while on my period and I was getting so emotional (bcuz during your period you feel like that, girls you can understand) and almost crying cuz of my dam* period and the fact that I couldnt get the cd. Well anywayz get this cd if your lucky enough and can find it YOU WONT REGRET IT.Oh yeah if anyone from here know where to find the cd tell me.And another question is the Mr Capone-e chicano or pakistani?"
4,NETWORKED TV,"Well, it isn't HDTV but it works and works well! You can see clearly once it is set up properly. The system installed easily and worked out of the box with no problems. The software was a bit sparce but it worked. I use it to take pictures of patients and the quality is good. Hey, it's no Mona Lisa but at least I can see which Mrs Jones is here today!Buy it. It is good value for money."
4,breathes new life into my old stereo system,"Rather then getting rid of my old yet perfectly functional, good quality bookshelf music stereo system and investing +$300 in a new ipod-friendly system, I decided to give this little gizmo a try. It works like a charm...now i can play music and podcasts off my computer via bluetooth and it sounds just great (after all, speaker technology hasn't that much in the past few years for low-end music systems). My system's CD player and cassette deck may not see a whole lot of action going forward, but neither will my wallet.Make sure you check what kind of auxiliary input/output jacks your system uses. My system has RCA inputs so I had to purchase a special connecting cord for the unit to work."
5,3.5mm to rca male connectors cable,"it's from sony, so you can trust the quality. gold plated connectors, flexible but not soft cable, it should do fine. i am using this to connect a dell mini9 to a sound board at a radio station, and then playing music from a flash drive and from a memory stick pro duo. why haul all that music. and this thing weighs practically nothing. definitely long enough, and easy to wind up and put away. cool."
5,Actually gold plated,"Much better than I expected. Uses 99.99% oxygen free copper. Unlike in the picture, the ends appear to be gold plated and the connectors are sturdy. The cable itself is a matte black finish with a nice texture, and pliable-- not stiff and shiny like some cheaper ones out there. A steal for the price. Have not done audio fidelity tests-- but sounds good to me."
4,"Good, ultra-compact, all-in-one radio.","The radio is a very small and compact device which fits in a cup holder.The scan function on the marine band works well, as I used it to monitor9, 12, 16 and 22 which were used in the area. The scan function on FMdoes not work well, since it would often stop just before the station'sactual frequency. Likewise, tuning in the FM band is too fine grainedand I wish it was a setting option in the menu. The antenna (non-removable,because of FRS) is very stiff and I wish it would be more flexible.Overall I am very happy with the radio because of the features, size,and the battery that lasts a long time."
2,Bad speaker from new,"I bought this new and thought the poor quality of sound was due to the submersible speaker but had nothing else to compare it to. A friend bought the HX 750S and I then realized just how bad the sound was. I then listened to the same model owned by someone else, and there is no problem with theirs. They use their constantly and have had no issues.Mine was used mostly for WX reports prior to lake kayaking now and then and really loved the size of this unit. Very disappointed ending up with VHF that is hard to understand what is being received."
4,a must-have for beatlemaniacs!,"I found that reading this book is as joyful as anthology.Although this is less beautiful in artwork. But in detail it's fantastic[and the selected picture is excellent].Badman's work is not bad at all.At last, I believe that in this book,The Beatles off the record,may you can find more truth, so buy it ..for the 'boys''sake!"
3,Where's the editor?,This is a fun book to read for a Beatles fan but be prepared for the fact that it was obviously not even looked at by an editor or even written with a spellchecker. There are more errors on any one page of this book than you will find in most other complete books. I was amazed at the amount of errors. Mick Tagger of the Rolling Stones? Are you kidding me?While it is full of interesting facts it was actually hard to read because of it's poor editing.
5,Circulon Infinite is great for induction cooking!,"I got this pan when I got my Circulon Infinite Induction Cooker. The conductivity of the aluminum with the induction capability of the stainless disk make a great cook pan! I deep fry, stir fry, saute before braising, braise, boil for pasta, etc., etc., etc! Clean up is a snap! It quickly became my favorite cook pan because I don't have the ""hot spot"" problem with it that I have with some other pans using and induction burner. I use primarily All-Clad, but I now intend to buy other Circulon Infinite cookware. And guess what, I used to hate Circulon cookware!"
5,New RESPECT for Circulon!,"What can I say that hasn't already been said by the previous viewers? I've used it five times. It easily browns a 5-pound tube of ground chuck and draining the grease was no problem; or a pot of split pea soup with ham, bone and all. If I were stuck in the wilderness with only one pot to cook with, this is the one I want. It's very substantial but not too heavy. The only pot hanging on my pot rack that is not Calphalon, yet matches it very well. I have a new respect for Circulon and don't hesitate to recommend this piece.Added 7-28-10: I just wish it had a glass lid, but I use a glass lid from an everyday Calphalon casserole pan that fits this pan. I have found it DOES scratch even with the hard plastic utensils."
5,Very nice,"I was lucky enough to find this at a retail store ""Marshalls"" at $49.00. This pot is hugh and heavy and I love it. Purchased the $209 set on this site along with three more 8 quart pots under 80873 for $37 a piece as well. I think these pots will last a lifetime. Search product code 80873 and get the 8 quart pot for $25. I just purchased one for my sister. If you like it...you should buy this one. Even if I did get it cheaper...it's still cheaper than Circulon website."
4,Love this Pan,It is easy to clean up. Nice size. Heats very well. Handle remains cool. Only negative is the weight. Love this pan.
2,Not a great design,"The actual cooking surface is surprisingly small, at least 2"" smaller than outside circumference. For comparison purposes, this Circulon 6-qt is less than 9"" across the bottom. Contrast this to the 7-1/2 qt Circulon stockpot, which is not that much taller but a full 11.5 inches of actual cooking surface.Pan is bottom-heavy, good for cooking but definitely a two-handed lift when full. Lid does not fit tight enough for a really good seal; it just 'sits' on the top edge."
4,Great Blast from the Past,"This toy was the hit of Christmas. More so than other more expensive gifts under the tree. All three of my children (two 12-year-olds and a 17-year-old) were fighting over who got to play with this. It's nice to know that the simple toys are still appealing. My only frustration is that the lights stay on whenever it's attached to the metal frame and now are burned out. Will have to figure out if I can replace. But toy still works, just without the light show.Also, was thrilled to be able to find something like this on Amazon - couldn't imagine trying to find in a store. Like a needle in a haystack."
2,Cheapy,I loved this toy as a child and thought a light would be a great addition. However out of the package the twirler was not able to properly stay on the track. After a few seconds the twirler became crooked and was not be able to move on the track. Frustrating for adults. I would recommend finding a similar but better quality spinner.
4,"good fun, reminds me of when I was a kid",I had one of these as a kid and an odd bonus of this toy is it sort of builds your arm muscle if you use it a lot! Have fun
2,Cheap,"Not the same quality as the version I remember playing with as a kid. The rails come out of alignment easily, meaning the wheel won't spin freely."
3,Wheel Falls Between Rails,It's easy enough to do a temporary fix by squeezing the rails together but the wheel eventually falls through or gets stuck.
3,OKay toy!,OK toy when you are on the go & need something fast to grab and take along with not having to worry batteries going out on you.
2,Rail Twirler,"This was not the toy I had expected. With the wavy rail, it is almost impossible to keep the wheel on it. The wheel continuesly would fall sideways on the wavy part of the rail, and the wheel would jamb. My grandson found it more interesting to find something metallic and stick the magnetic part of the wheel to it. Also, the batteries went out within a very short time of use."
2,Stocking stuffer,"Deliver was as promised. I used this toy as a stocking stuffer. I bought it and a few other toys for my teens. I do have to say I concur with the other reviews that it's not well put together. The ""ball"" will roll nearly one complete time, then it comes off the small rails. I haven't really looked closely at what may cause it not to work. I was skeptical about buying it, but was hopeful. I'm just glad I didn't pay much for it and would NOT recommend it to anyone else."
3,"More history, less real mathematics?","Only two things made me give the book better than two stars:the idea of an error term to:d(x^n)/dx=n*x^(n-1)+error(f(x,n)).And the mention of harmonic triangle:t(n,m)=1/(n*Binomial[n,m])The question of what would mathematics be like without Leibniz and Newtonand calculus really takes us back to what mathematics was like in 1600:geometry, algebra and number theory. That mathematics had such a great part in the industrial revolution by making physics, a science based mainly on derivative calculus, makes me think that we would have sailing ships and horses still.The fact that he pretty much leaves out fractional calculus is anotherstrike against him presenting a true history of calculus."
5,READ!,"Are you interested in the historical and philosophical development of the calculus? If so, then purchase this book immediately. Great Reading."
3,The Real Bloodline by Tim Wallace-Murphy,It is always a disappointment when the background music covers some of the words said (at least for me). It does wet the appetite for what is in his books. They are not to be missed.Rex Deus: the True Mystery of Rennes-Le-Chateau and the Dynasty of Jesus
4,You could be friends with the descendants of Jesus,"This is a fascinating interview with retired psychologist and cultural historian, Tim Wallace-Murphy, about the latter-day descendants of Jesus and role of Gnosticism and the Knights Templar, among other things. Wallace-Murphy, whose writing was used by Dan Brown when writing The DaVinci Code, says, ""Yes, there are countless people descended from Jesus still around. I know quite a few of them who, knowing that, say So what? Does it matter?"" What matter, he says, is what they are doing with their own lives now. While it helps to have some knowledge of the subject matter, Wallace-Murphy speaks conversationally and with humor about his professional and spiritual quest."
4,Thin Lizzy - Black Rose a Rock Legend - original Japanese import,"Lizzy - Black Rose a Rock Legend - original Japanese importClassic Lizzy album, with Gary Moore returning to the band.Tracks are:1. Do Anything You Want To2. Toughest Street In Town3. S & M4. Waiting For An Alibi5. Sarah6. Got To Give It Up7. Get Out Of Here8. With Love9. Roisin Dubh (Black Rose) A Rock Legend"
3,Okay....put on the brakes if you don't own anything by these guys yet,"This album has a handful of what one might consider...bad songs. Now maybe I was spoiled after hearing Jailbreak, but I'd say FIGHTING is a better over all album. ""Do anything you want to"" and ""Waiting for an alibi"" are two songs on here worth noting. There are certainly some awesome solos on this recording as well. The last song, the title track, was what got me pumped for this album, however the track before it left such a sour taste in my mouth I didn't enjoy it as much. This is why people buy mp3s I guess. If you don't want to be disappointed get Jailbreak, it's flawless."
5,One the classics!,"Black Rose is a memorable album. I remember when it was first released and I jammed to every song over and over. ""Got to Give it Up"" was sadly all too true for Phil Lynot, but at least his and the band's music lives on in a fantastic recording like this."
4,the Gary album,"Phil always wanted to do an album with his old pal Gary Moore, and he got his wish on this album. Patience pays off on Black Rose, the likes of which we will never hear again. Gary was probably the most technical player in lizzy's history up to that point, and pushed the band to play faster and tighter. Black Rose in particular shows Gary's stamp with heavier riffs, blistering soloing and intense dual leads with scott. Phil sings differently as well, being a little more fired up than usual. Overall, the sound is different, more produced and heavier a la do anything you want to. However, the consistency of good songs is not quite up to par as with fighting, jailbreak et al. Black Rose is nonetheless worth the price of admission."
5,Don't Give It Up!,"This is a flawless album. From the hard rocking Waiting for An Alibi with it's meaty bass, to the beautiful ballad Sarah, Black Rose is pure perfection. I highly suggest you get yourself a copy."
5,"easy to follow, outcome tastes good","I love Jenny White's style. She uses a simple language, gives clear instructions, unusual recipes, very creative. Outcome tastes great. Not just few recipes are good, almost all of them are."
2,Uneven,"There is interesting stuff in this book. Unfortunately, there's also a lot of boring information including pages and pages of transcripts. The writer should have done a better job of integrating the transcripts with the manuscript. Still, if you're willing to wade through tedious, uninteresting information, there are some interesting cases and detective techniques strewn in here too."
4,There is more there than you think!,"At first I thought I was looking at a strange new way to exercise but for what part of the body should advantage from this item? It is great for not only strengthening the hands for sports that handle rackets or clubs but it is also great to move & relax the muscles that are in the palm of the hands. If you get writer's cramp or your fingers feel so achey this is the one you use to WAKE UP your fingers, your palm of your hands, to ease up on all that tention that has buildt up due to over working your fingers to the bone so to speak. Hey, every muscle needs a ""workout"" every now & then to help it to relax which makes GREAT theraphy & IS CHEAPER!!!!"
1,"The Printer was defecated, since the ship cost so much I do not know what to do with it.","The Printer was defecated, since the ship cost so much I do not know what to do with it. The printer make a lot of noice when printing and the paper do not roll out. Lots of different PCL error messages."
5,Works and looks like new,"We needed to replace a similar laser printer we've had for years that finally quit working correctly. We decided to get the exact same model (no longer being manufactured) because our Unix server and software is configured for it already. This printer looks like new, even though it was refurbished! Arrived very clean, although they could have used something less messy to pack it in. It was well-packed, but they used lots of Styrofoam popcorn to fill the box. That caused a huge mess trying to unpack the printer. Other than that, everything is working fine and I'm happy I bought this printer from this particular seller. No problems!"
3,This is a children's book.,"I'm reading one or two volumes on each of the U.S. Presidents. When I ordered this book, there were not as many choices of titles about Franklin Pierce as appear on Amazon now. This is a children's book and I didn't see a description of it as a children's book. However, the book has great pictures and a timeline as well as pictures and dates of all Presidents to G.W. Bush. This volume is a concise outline of Franklin Pierce's life with a few sentences devoted to each important event in his life. Very easy reading. Also included is a helpful list of online sites and titles for ""more advanced reading""."
3,All style but no 'great deal of' content...,"I actually saw this book by chance at a rather spendid art gallery in Edinburgh. The first thing that struck me was the style; warm and inviting, and also able to still capture the child in me somewhere.I bought it, I took it home, read it in 2 mins, and put in down again...Yes its arty, no its not ground-breaking in story content...and only a mild sense of charm to the narrative.But there's enough there to make me still glad that I bought it...a nice cozy addition to the coffee table..."
2,not worth it for the price! go with volume 3,"It's a shame I say that really. The four tracks I do like on here (out of 22!!!) are very good. They are:Moving fast manCamping JazzTokiMoonbathingThis are extremely nice, downtempo beats that truly resonate to me what this genre is all about. The touch on the ambient side that these tracks also use are very nicely done. I just can't say the rest of the cd is worth it though b/c the tracks didn't sound right, seemed annoying, repetative, and mostly, made me want to go back and listen to these four all over again."
1,Stops working all the time,"When I first got this I thought it was the ultimate. However, it stops working all the time. To get it working again you need to read four Microsft knowledbase aricles and uninstall - reboot- reinstall the software. About 30 minutes worth of work. If you need something to do for 30 minutes every single week then you can afford the time it takes to keep this running.We have the same set-up at work and have the same problems there. So it is clearly a flaw in the product."
4,Not bad at all.,"Anybody having trouble with this item, make sure you have Windows XP Service Pack 2 installed. They greatly improved BlueTooth support with SP2. I use the keyboard as my primary, and also as a travel keyboard for use with my BlueTooth-capable Dell Axim PDA. The only real complaint I have is that the mouse sleeps too quickly, and you have to fiddle to wake it up again. I would like to be able to turn off the sleep function. A tradeoff, I know, with battery life."
2,Keyboard stops working,"I like everything about the keyboard/mouse, but the fact is, the keyboard stops working periodically (every day or so for me) and I need to remove the batteries and put them back for it to start working again. Major pain."
1,Worst Keyboard and mouse combo ive owned,"This keyboard and mouse is horrible, all i get is connection problems almost everytime i turn on the computer i have to get my wired mouse and keyboard out its just horrible if i wanted to use wired i have a very nice wired set now ,ive very dissatisfied with this product and wouldnt recommend it to anyone"
1,Not Ready for Prime Time!,"I've had this product for about a year now, and I finally had to pull the plug. I started having crashes on boot up, and my pc wouldn't wakeup from standby. After taking this product out of the loop, all problems went away. Microsoft drivers are not available for download, so I have to assume they haven't had an update to the drivers since this product was released. Also, the mouse also goes through batteries like butter. I tried using rechargeables; however the mouse started acting flaky, so I went back to using non-rechargeable batteries. Finally I gave up, and I returned to my old corded keyboard and mouse."
2,Major Pain,"I purchased 3 of these combos to use in several conference rooms and they are a support nightmare. The mice regularly get lost and have to be re-detected, which is fine for me but clueless users are bombarding the help desk. I thought it was the IBM laptops since they are shut down after every use, but now I leave them on all the time and after as little as 15-20 minutes of inactivity the mouse gets dropped from the list of detected devices and has to be re-detected. May be XP SP2 will fix it?..."
2,annoying,"ive had mine for a long time and most of the time ive had it i hadent been able to get it to work, any other wireless keyboard and mouse set would probably be a better idea. on another machine the logitech wireless system worked as soon as it was pluged in, but this required many hours troubleshooting, uninstalling and reinstalling just trying to get it to finally see that yes there is infact a keyboard and mouse present within its range. so if your into annoying things, please by all means buy it. otherwise id at least recomment a wireless set where you can charge the mouse batterys so they dont run out too quickly. i suppose that is a plus, the batterys dont run out *too* fast with the microsoft one.."
2,when it works,Had the keyboard and mouse for 3 weeks and the keyboard stopped working. The computer still detected it but the radio signal stopped. The mouse works fine. I am taking it back to the store.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"This is NOT A GOOD PRODUCT. Please, do not waste your time or money as I have. Microsoft has released a Beta product to the public as far as I am concerned.It looks SPECTACULAR, that's why I bought it. ""Ooooh Shiny."" Well, get that out of your mind right now, this product sucks... BAD.If you don't believe me. Buy it. You'll see what I mean. Pick up a Logitech DUO Wireless Combo instead and save yourself a few headaches."
2,Don't buy it for Bluetooth!!!,"It's very simple: if you want a great wireless desktop solution, but don't give a hoot about Bluetooth connectivity, this is the product for you. If you want to ever connect to anything else via Bluetooth, don't even think about it.I have done hours of Googling looking for a solution to this problem, but have come up with the same result everywhere I go: the Microsoft BT dongle is virtually useless outside of communicating with the mouse and keyboard (and maybe a printer). It seems that many people have had to buy a BT dongle from a 3rd party and throw away the Microsoft dongle.I feel extremely betrayed by Microsoft's claims of connectivity with this set-up. I just bought a Sony Ericsson T616 with BT, and can't use it with my computer. If you want to connect a phone, don't buy this product!!!"
2,A quick summary,"The good points:The mouse is ergonomic, has 5 buttons, and once you take a file to some of the sharp mould lines, it feels quite comfy. Both the keyboard and mouse feel (and look) like quality products. Being wireless there are no keyboard or mouse leads to clutter up the desk.The bad points:Mouse battery life is less than a week (I'm replacing my NiCad rechargeables every two days!); the keyboard batteries lasts about 6 weeks.The mouse (and occasionally keyboard) is frequently forgotten by Windows, and has to be manually unisnstalled and re-installed every time this happens. Which is about twice a week.All of the bad points could be fixed with a software upgrade; Microsoft know about the problems, but haven't released any updated drivers since the product was released.I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy."
1,Not nearly as good as Logitech,"Battery life in this unit is about as bad as you can get. It also doesn't communicate well with the receiver, even at distances as close as 5 feet, it would lose the signal. This was my second Microsoft keyboard set (different models) and both failed to impress. The only good thing I have to say about this is that even though I didn't buy this driectly from Microsoft, they accepted the return and issued a refund for the full price paid, including shipping. They even paid return shipping. I've since bought Logitech and haven't had any issues with either one."
5,Upbeat Sound!,"After I first heard ""A Secret Secret"", one of the great songs on this CD, I listened to the whole album. What a fun CD this is! I love Ashley Stove from N.C. You cannot go wrong. Every song is genius."
1,Will not turn off,"We have had the same experience as others. After a few months, it will not turn off. It is a piece of junk and I would only recommend it to someone I did not like!"
1,Waste of Money,Take my advice. This book is very bad. Probably the worst I have ever attempted to read. This story could have been told in 25 pages. You will get sick of him (Lance)telling you what a player he is. Just doesn't make much sense. I did not finish this book and probably will not.
1,BORING AND A WASTE OF MONEY,"I WILL NEVER, EVER GET ANOTHER BOOK FROM THIS AUTHOR, THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST BOOKS I'VE READ. THE AUTHOR STARTS OFF BY TELLING SIZES OF WOMEN AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE CERTAIN STYLES THEN THEY'RE NOT APPROVED FOR CERTAIN ""THINGS."" PLEASE, A WOMEN'S SIZE DOESN'T MAKE HER LESS OR MORE SPECIAL THEN THE NEXT PERSON. MARK PLEASE GET ANOTHER STORY LINE AND TAKE THIS MESS OFF THE MARKET. BORING AND TO MAKE IT SO BAD, I LET SEVERAL PEOPLE HOLD THIS BOOK AND I GOT THE SAME RESPONSE, THIS BOOK MISSED A LOT OF MARKS AND IT WAS BORING FROM START TO FINISH. I WLL NEVER BUY ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR BOOKS AGAIN, I WORK TO HARD TO GIVE MY MONEY AWAY TO AN AUTHOR THAT DEGRADE WOMEN AND PUT THEM DOWN."
3,I laughed out loud---sort of,"Sections of this book had me laughing and shaking my head at Lance's antics, extreme cover-ups, and uninhibited thoughts and candidness. The author did a great job at allowing readers into the head of a self-proclaimed dog. However, the author also had a habit of ""telling"" periods of dialogue rather than showing and for all the sex that was mentioned, the book lacked descriptive. Erotica is obviously not one the of the author's fine suits. The ending left me confused. It was almost as if it was rushed and slapped together. I would be interested to know if Lance and Nicole's marriage survived the long run and if Lance was really as rehabilitated as he suggested---or at least I think that was what he suggested. A sequel would be needed to make sense of it all."
4,Just Like A Man to Write This Book!,This book was pretty good! The character Lance was really a DOG for real! It was a few boring parts in the book and I also feel that he was let off the hook to easily. cause if that was my man.....well you don't want to know what I would have done to him.
3,Definitely written from a man's perspective!!,"I read the book and was expecting to find some sort of backlash or repercussions for the main character's actions of cheating on his wife, and there weren't any. The book ended basically with him still cheating, fathering another kid, and still married to the woman he cheated on. Definitely written by a man and from their own perspective."
1,WHAT THE?,"I can review this book in two words............HATED IT!!!!!!!!!It really deserves no stars, don't waste your time or your money on this book."
3,So-So,I gave this book 3 stars. The cover made the book look interesting.When I started reading I felt it was going kinda slow and then it picked up and then slowed down.Lance is married to Nicole but he cheats on her.He is a christian and preaches a bit much throughout the book.Its like this book allows you to get inside a man's head which was interesting but at the same time the book got on my nerves.Lance was a straight up dog who wanted his cake and eat it too type of person.Im really not sure I'd recommend this book but if its on your to-read-list by all means go ahead and read it.I felt like it was missing something.
3,poppy quo but good quo,"Thirsty work was one of the bands more poppy efforts. It is the quo type of poprock though and that's more rocky for sure than most pop drivel. Too long time fans like me at the time though , this one was a good cd but I wanted more of a straight forward rockin one , and they didn't give me that till the 00's again. they instead put out some solid pop rockers like this one, 'don't stop' , 'under the influence' , then the cover cd 'famous in the least century' (old rock songs redone by quo) that was three in a row that older fans could enjoy but not love perhaps. I can say that there's lots of good pop rock here though. and like every quo cd they had hit singles on it! GO QUO!QUo is one of the best rock bands of all time. But on this cd it's just not their peak in style or such. Songs like 'sherry"" would make few rock fans faves list. But a weaker quo cd is better than alot of pop artists best."
5,Favorite childhood book,"I adore this book beyond reason and have lovingly sheltered my ancient copy over the years since my childhood to share every Christmas with my own three children. I have looked for it every time I'm near used book sales and was delighted to come across an affordable second copy 20 years ago during overseas travels. The E-bay auctions for the old ones are completely out of sight! I am truly thrilled that this is back in print, and I am sending copies to everyone I know with young families. I am sure that they will treasure it as my family does. My now grown-up kids will each get a copy this Christmas as well, and I am eagerly anticipating their joyful reactions to being back in touch once again with all of the beloved characters, especially Granny Glittens and her mittens."
4,Christmas treasury,"This book is a must-have for your children's Christmas story collection, a great choice for snuggling up at night during the holidays with your family. It's filled with lots of classic tales about Christmas, and some that have been faded in the cultural memory, but which are well worth sharing. My children particularly enjoyed the tale of the Babushka, searching for the little child who was born on Christmas night. There is a wonderful variety of stories to choose from, and a well-rounded treasury to appeal to both boys and girls alike."
5,"Very good introductory, intermediate swimming book .",This book is a must for every one who wants to a learn about swimming strokes from a begining to an advanced level. Also included pictures for the non competitive strokes.
5,This is an awesome tool! We love these books/series!,"The 'Following God series"" is a wonderful study and tool. We are using it for our Home Bible Fellowship group; the study is lengthy but light and meaty enough for all!"
3,Good overview; little too much speculation,"We ordered this Bible study for our small group because we wanted a broad Old Testament focus so that our group members could become more comfortable with this portion of the Bible. It has worked well for that purpose, and the price is certainly right - about $5 cheaper than at most Christian bookstores. However, some of the studies have been a little disappointing; sometimes basing most of the lesson on an assumption about the prophet's life that isn't really known rather than focusing on his message. Isaiah was particularly disappointing in light of the incredible depth of that book... I felt they did it a disservice. But overall it has been a good study and challenging to our group."
4,Good.,"The Zephyr Song is a magically moving piece that comes across as pop-rock, psychedelic gem. Personally, it comes off with a little too much glamour; however this is resolved when paired with its hard, intricate guitar solos and riffs. John Frusciante's vocal harmonies intertwine majestically with the tempo and feel of the song. This is the first version of the Single, complete with ""Out of Range"" and ""Rivers of Avalon""The second track, ""Out of Range"" is another breezy, in your face 70's song that transports you to another time dimension. ""Rivers of Avalon"", however, is a beautifully polished ecstasy of pure mind-blowing bliss. It's one of the greater b-side songs yet. It is definitely the treasure of this bunch; one should cherish this dearly.Recommended."
3,"academic and deep, absorb in small doses","I appreciate Dr. Grayson's academic/thinking overview of some complex elements of love, relationships and human emotional and physical experiences. The audio version is very long......and dry at times.....listening to it feels like sitting in a lecture hall......for the well read there will be several repetitive anecdotes referred to......are we humans having a spiritual experience or spiritual beings having a human experience for example......I have read/heard that phrase so often......but for those seeking ideas based on current literature and science....the thinking view of love....a practical, intellectual ""head"" guide to very unpredictable and illogical at times ""heart"" emotional experience of love...this work has some interesting points to review....thank you Dr. Grayson for your insights."
2,Elegant presentation -- short on pix and details,Not enough photos -- not enough details. Best suited for a coffee table there one's attention span is short.
1,Looking Forward,"Throughout the autobiography, I got a headache because the book was so extremely boring. Don't get me wrong, I do respect George Bush. I am just stating that he was a better president than is a writer. After about the first ten to fifteen pages, the book did a steep fall in its level of interest. The next chapters were highly boring and were similar to each other. Being in politics isn't exactly the greatest and most exciting life. All I wanted to say was that if you want action in a story, read ""James Bond."""
4,There goes the neighborhood !!,"Tom Hanks stars in this kinda dark comedy about new residents moving into this very nosey neighborhood.They dig through your trash, break into your house and then blow it up by trying to find dead bodies in the basement.Come to find out there's nothing to find in the house they're all in the trunk of the car that the new residents have been driving.A perfect picture of how people have their nose in everybodies business except their own.I would say this a good comedy, not Tom's best, but still worth buying.I rate this movie a 4 of 5 stars!!"
5,Suburban Paranoia is Halarious,"After hearing strange noises coming from the house next door, Ray Peterson (Tom Hanks) becomes suspicious of his new neighbors. His best friend (Rick Ducommon) and a close neighbor (Bruce Dern) begin to investigate the disappearance of an old man (Gale Gordon) that lives down the street. They think the new neighbor (Henry Gibson), with the help of his two relatives, may have killed the old man and buried him somewhere on their property. Ricky (Corey Feldman), a teenager on the block, watches the antics of the men for entertainment and invites his friends to watch as well. There is never a dull moment in this movie and there is one laugh after another. Carrie Fisher, Wendy Schaal, and Cortney Gains also deliver great performances. Joe Dante directs this wonderful comedy about normal people becoming paranoid in the suburbs. This is one of those movies that you will remember and laugh about for years."
4,BEFORE HE BECAME A JERK,"Before Tom Hanks made it as big boxoffice, he did this little movie that was well made, great backup cast, such as my favourite Corey Feldman, and a cute ending.Worth the look...it is basically a cult movie."
4,Classic,"This flick sucks me in everytime. The army vet playing war and calling that guy ""Rubes"". The bees. ""The doctor!"" The fat guy chanting ""I wanna kill everyone. Satan is good, satan is our pal."" There are just so many great scenes and yet I haven't seen it in probably a decade. Can't wait to pick up the DVD."
3,"Better after repeated viewings-satire, not reality","This satire, taking place entirely inside an upscale cul-de-sac, relies on it's setting and subject matter to drive it's points home.I think it does the job fairly well, with amusing characters, jabbing at life in suburbia in a way that rings true to reality and offering a huge dose of ridiculous comic relief that makes for an enjoyable, fun movie.If you take the movie for what it is, you can be entertained and even amused by the sly, serious points it attempts to make, amid some improbable clutter!"
4,Back when Tom Hanks was fun to watch,"Before Tom Hanks got all serious and delusional under the guidance of Steven Speilsburg, he had a long string of enjoyable comedies in the 80's. The Burbs is a good ol' 80's flick in the same fun vein as Volunteers, Splash, and Bachelor Party.Well the 80's are gone forever (sniff sniff), but the movies live on. The Burbs is about a typical American neighborhood that just got some weird neighbors. You got the 'Doctor', 'Hans', and the rest of the ghoulish gang. The whole neighborhod thinks they murdered and sacrificed an elderly neighbor (who's really at the hospital).Carrie Fisher is great as Tom's wife, however the big breasted blonde housewife steals every scene she's in.Some good laughs in this one."
5,"I saw it on TBS at 2:00 am, i owned it the next week","I have never seen a comedy suspense before or again but this movie is great, complete with the surprise ending. my favorite quote from the movie ""I've never seen that before, I've never seen anyone drive there garabage to the end of the street then bang the hell out of with a stick, I've never seen that""-hanks This is my favorite hanks movie I love Rick Ducommun, Bruce Dern, Corey Feldman Great movie, I noticed something I have never seen before about 2 months ago when Walter was eating all there food he eat some dog food I loved it, I love this movie, my 3rd favorite movie"
5,This movie was fantastic!,"I personally think this movie was great not only because it gets you on the edge of your seat, but because the characters are all hilarious! If you like mysteries, than you'll love The Burbs!"
4,A Great Movie,"This is simply one of the funniest ""dark comedy"" movies ever made--I can't believe it flopped at the box office.Highly recommended."
4,Your neighbor is a freak,This movie gives everyone a good reason to suspect thier next door neighbors of being worse than your imagination and it's your duty to take it upon yourself to protect the neighborhood. This movie is good entertainment.
3,Burbs',"Funny, Cool, and great memories. I bought this for movie memory collections from my childhood. Plus were it was film, I been there several times."
4,"Satan Is Good, Satan Is Our Pal...","This is one of those movies, that for whatever reason, is difficult to look away from once you begin watching it. Tom Hanks is wonderful as ""everyman"" Ray Peterson. I think anyone who grew up in (or now lives in) the suburbs will get a real kick out of this film. Every neighborhood in America has a ""ghost story"" or two about something that happened there many years ago...or a house that seems to be ""haunted"" because no one mows the lawn or picks up the mail. This movie has a great balance of comedy and mystery to it. Are the Klopeks really killing people and burning them up in their basement? Or have Ray, Art, and Mark let their imaginations get the better of them? The answer is in question until the very end of the movie. If you miss Tom Hanks doing comedies...this is the film to see. Ray crumpling beer cans or screaming in the backyard after finding a femur bone sets me off laughing every time I see this flick. This is great fun for a rainy Saturday afternoon."
4,Good Saburb!,"This movie is a very funny, mysterious, and a sort of a hiper movie! This is one of Tom Hank's best movie's!"
3,Who's next door?,"Who is next door is the question you may ask yourself after seeing this classic movie filled with timeless moments? Tom Hanks decides to stay at home for his vacation with wife and son. To bad his anoying buddy from next door is completly convinced that the new neighbors are some sort of cult! Sure they are kind of strange but when an old man down the street comes up missing these nosey neighbors jump in to action, and form a pact to snoop around and check out these new strange neighbors. Filled with some ridicules but funny moments. What will happen to them when the new neighbors see who's spying on them? It is funny but it might not be very funny but worth seeing though."
3,This movie is very funny,"This movie is a very active and very fun to watch and get a few laughs out of,except for the story is kinda cheesy. Although Tom Hanks being my fav. actor this is a must have."
2,Bad idea,"What the hell is the idea behind this outre mish mosh? Elements that all seem to be at odds with one another (comedy, mysterious horror, Tom Hanks) make for a truly bizarre film, made for an audience of heaven knows whom."
2,not so good,"Tom Hanks became a star with the movie SPLASH (after Chevy Chase and Dudley Moore turned down the part). He then made a few good movies that were also hits. Then he went into the gutter with THE MONEY PIT, JOE VS. THE VOLCANO and THE BURBS. If BIG hadn't rescued him from this string of losers, he might be doin TV now. But he was rescued by BIG. Anyway, THE BURBS is a bad movie; the type of movie that makes you scratch your head that it ever got made. Yes there are some funny moments. But overall, this is junk."
4,Fantastically Funny,"Tom Hanks is a superb actor I have always enjoyed his acting. The star line-up in this film meshed well with Tom Hanks. This writer/director knew what he was doing when he produced this film! It is quite entertaining, never a dull moment!! I have watched ""The Burbs"" a dozen times and I am never bored with it."
4,Funny non-stop with hilarious espionage skits,This is another 80's comedic classic with a unique event unwinding in a regular suburbanite neighbourhood and a few dumb people trying to get to the bottom of the eerie events taking place at the house where the 'freaks' moved in. If you were into that eighties vibe type of movie with a potency of hilarity then you should atleast see this one once!
1,A plotless and trite comedy,"The run-off the mill Haunted House and the nabours investigate plot (or lack of it) is long and lifeless. Hanks manages to save face and the acting of the ""Doctor"" is rather amusing but the rather pitiful acting of the other cast show how much a waste of time it it. A fine film to watch on TV, but save the money and DON'T buy it."
1,Terrible attempt at a comedy,"This movie is not funny but scary. I watched it when I was a little kid and it gave me nightmares. It should be classified as a horror movie. Well, I've rewatched it since then and have not changed my mind. Though it did not give me nightmares, I will always be afraid to go near such a horrible film again. The bad acting, bad script, and overall bad plot makes for a frighteningly bad evening of movie viewing."
1,Worthless Trash,"This has to be the worst movie ever made. It is boring, wierd, annoying. I can't believe how anyone would laugh at this worthless trash. And for those of you who say it is your favorite movie and have seen it tons of times, i feel sorry for you. What a piece."
5,a great throw back movie,"Classic!This is a favorite. Quirky and stylized, the film ranges from over-the-top to subtle. Perfectly cast, it's a comedic romp where the leads are almost as fiendish as the adversaries. It never did much box office, but it's now almost a cult pick."
4,One of my absolute favorites!,"It's not hysterical, but is more a feel-good comedy -about three very different neighbors uniting against the new ""unseen"" neighbor, so anynomous and strange that the entire neighborhood becomes paranoid. And all the peculiar noises coming from the house at night doesn't help their anxiousity. It looks something like a ""ghost house"", and so different than the rest of the houses/gardens down the street. The theme of these three neighbors, and the actors of course, works perfect. It hadn't been as funny without Hanks and Dern and ""the fat guy"" (Art in the movie). I have no idea how many times I've watched ""The Burbs"", but it's many -and in its' simplicity it appeals to you as a movie to relax to, and to be honest; these are the neighbors you'd love to live next to.God, I love that street!"
4,Beware of the Klopeks!,The Burbs was one of my favorite movies as a child and I was so thrilled when I finally found it on DVD! It is extremely an late 80's film but it still has magic that will always be with this movie! Tom Hanks is the star in this movie. Basically he is vacation when he notices that his new neighbors are fishy to say the least. Him and his two neighbors decide to investigate. They try to get information many different comical ways-and in the end they end up even in the Klopek's house (the weird neighbors). When in the house they end up hitting a gas line and blowing up the house when this happens they are set to be arrested but something will turn up to prove the Klopek's were not who they acted like they were. This movie is filled with humor and is an over all good time. But to those it is 80's acting and it is 80's looking. Which I personally like but some may not enjoy. If you love 80's flicks this is one to add to your list!
5,The Trouble with Suburbia,"Would you like to know what your neighbors really do in their spare time? Well, The Burbs may not be completely truthful, but it is hilarious to watch. Here's a dark comedy that pokes fun at suburbia and the people who live in it. It may not be laugh-out-loud funny, but it's funny nonetheless. The acting ensemble is first-rate: Hanks, Fisher, Ducommun, Dern, and Feldman played their parts perfectly. The silly horror gimmicks never get tiring after repeated viewings. This is one of director Joe Dante's better films, and it really is worth watching."
4,When those neighbors are on the loose... get ready to laugh,"Get ready to laugh, because that is exactly what I think director Joe Dante(Explorers, Innerspace, Gremlins, Toy Soldiers...) did that movie for.Everything starts out by the disappearance of an old couple in the neighborhood, and the arrival of new people in that house. No one saw the old ones leave, no one saw the new ones moving in, all they got to know was that, they were already there.So Tom Hanks and friends decided to spy-out these newcomers in very funny ways. Once again the miraculous soundtrack of this film is composed by musical wizard composer Jerry Goldsmith and I really recommend it to everyone who can enjoy good movie soundtracks."
5,The Burbs ROCKED,"The Burb's is Tom Hanks' greatest work to date. With a star studded cast like this: Carrie Fisher(Princess Leia), Corey Feldman (Donatello in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles), Ray Ducommun(that drunk guy in Groundhog Day), and Bruce Dern(The Great Gatsby), how can you go wrong? It mixes horror with comedy, and comedy. Buy this MOVIE!!"
2,Creating Literacy Instruction for All lStudents,"The author/editor does not follow his own basic rules about an easily read size of type for a READING text. Seems fundamental to me!The author/editor does not follow basic rules about using different colors/fonts/sizes as a way of denoting major headings, headings, and details.There's FAR too much information in one chapter for any one student to digest in a week.It may be quality information, but it's NOT quality page readability.Restaurants will tell you--presentation matters."
4,not strictly a blues CD,"Her earlier CD knackelbrod Blues was almost entirely a blues CD and was very well done. This one features her in a variety of styles: pop,hard rock, lighter rock, with hints of blues. If you like Knackelbrod, you may or may not like this. A much larger range of styles is displayed here and she does sing almost everything well."
4,A Gentle book... perhaps too much so,"David Ariel's book is a gentle page turner that picks up speed in the latter half. For the reader looking for a rigorous look at Jewish renewal from a historical or philosophical perpsective, this is not the book for you. Ariel is interested in reawakening Jewish interest for the great middle mass of people; Jews who have lapsed, who were turned away from organized Jewish life, and wish to return with a more adult sense of Jewish spirituality to the faith. As such, the book clears away a great deal of general cultural issues in the begininng. In the latter half of the book, Ariel gets into halakah and specially Jewish matters. It seems unfortunate that Ariel did not move some of the matter in the last half of the book to the front. Had he done this, the book might have had a bit more bite. The New Age patina of the beginning would have been modified by some of the sharp and trenchant things he has to say about Jewish diversity in the latter half."
5,This is so simple!,"Cheryl Ladd. Early 20's. Jaclyn Smith. Kate Jackson.As wonderful as Farrah was, RIP, Cheryl blew the series out of the water, and almost40 years later, the cheesiness and silly plots, bad acting and the T and A all work.It's great stuff."
4,Charlie's Angels Season 2,"Little Angel in Lee Majors' Kitchen.Mother Goose is running Bosley's life.Those are just a couple of the episodes you can expect not to see on this DVD set.Yes, Farrah Fawcette has left the show (until 6 new guest appearances occur in seasons 3&4).The gap is filled by Cheryl Ladd, playing the younger sister Chris of Farrah's character Jill.Great tune used for most of the chase sequences.Sammy Davis Jr plays himself, and his lookalike.Both the feature films which opened Season 2 are presented as full 2 episode stories, complete with recap footage: ""Angels in Paradise"" and ""Angels on Ice.""Enjoy them,Peter"
5,Good Morning Angels!,"Why are we still waiting for seasons 3 through 5??? What's taking them so long? Other shows such as Knight Rider, Three's Company, Dukes of Hazzard, Starsky & Hutch, and Quantum Leap have released more than 2 seasons' worth. Hello? What's up with that?"
5,Charlie's Angels: Season 2,I still love this classic show!!! I only wish they had some extras at the end.
2,More bad episodes than good.,There are about 6 out 26 episodes that you may watch more than once.1st season is better.
3,not as good as season one,I'm very glad season 2 came out and hope the following seasons do too but clearly not as great as season one. The shows are alot sillier and just not as interesting. I still believe the first season was the best as the original angels were the best angels and had the better chemistry. And once Kate Jackson left well it really fell apart but still cool to have these shows on dvd.
3,Charlies Angels-The complete second season,"One of the campiest shows of the seventies, this second season has many memerable episodes. Although Farrah Fawcett did leave after season one, Cheryl Ladd does an adequate job as her replacement (she shows a lot more skin than any other angel). I admire Cheryl for coming on as Farrah's little sister, but you can judge for yourself that her acting in this season is dreadful. I would suggest purchasing season one, if you really want to see all three cast members at their best."
5,GREAT SET HERE,NICE BOX SET ALL CD WORKED WELL ALSO GOOD PICTURE WE WILL BUY THE NEXT SEASONS REAL SOON LOOKING FORWARD TO ATTAIN
3,"Interesting concept, slightly off on the delivery","Lydia Davis introduces an intriguing and unique concept in this story that makes you think a little bit differently while reading other novels afterward. The concept of this novel, whereby the narrator plays back an experience of love with the context of knowledge and emotions after the fact, makes you wonder how differently you would feel during past experiences, had you known what you know now. While this concept has really stuck with me for many months after reading the book, I found the story itself and depth of characters a little light and forgettable."
3,If You've Ever Been There ...,"This is a novel you may want to throw out the window, OR you may not be able to put it down ... It takes you someplace you'll probably never want to go again."
5,"Excellent Book, a Must-Read for any Office User","This is a great book, it is clearly written and has lots of useful information in it. I am taking a college course on Office 97 right now, and Woody's book is more helpful than my textbook which cost me $60. This book is very reasonably priced, compared to what other Office 97 books are selling for. Woody should think about adapting this book into a college textbook. I am sure that there are plenty of college students who would love to read this book too!"
4,Reach Up for the sunrise and Radio allow this to be a hit,"""Reach up..."" is a good, bouncy tune that one can sing along to and should of become the anthem on commercial radio. But the song does not break any real new ground for the band though and the song seemed like it was missing an element, maybe an extra guitar or something. The Jason Nevins Radio edit stays true to the original version and gives it the extra meat the original lacked. The other remix found on this single is decent also, but I would stick to the Jason Nevins Radio Edit any day."
5,"Autocourse, 1999-2000","Autocourse is the ultimate annual of the just completed Formula One season. My first volume covered the 1976 season and I own all but two since then. The only reason I missed those two was because they sold out before I could place my order. Each edition continually improves on the previous years with outstanding statistics for each race including lap charts, the absolute best photographs from the world's best photographers and an always intriguing editor's top ten drivers list. The race reports don't miss a beat from first to last place. The technical breakdown gives every detail of each car down to what brake pads and spark plugs they use. You are not a Formula One fan if you do not own Autocourse."
4,Tight IV Life Is Da...,"I would have to say this is a crunk Cd. It was put together well. But I got to say Tommy Gunn is the crunkest on the CD. and not just because he's family. But to be honest, I had no idea he had this lyrical talent. That's why when I first heard the CD I was completely shocked. Everybody else were great too. They all sound real good together. Keep it crunk for the ""Dirty South."""
2,some interesting cases but hardly a scientific method,"this is not a pretty book, either visually (ugly typesetting) or content. The biggest merit is it's printed on recycled paper. otherwise, it would be a bigger waste of trees. Mc-Graw's standard seems to have gone downhill.Some examples are quite intesreting. however, this book should really be called ""Case Studies by Mahalanobis-Taguchi System"" cause it really does not tell you much about the methodogy, its limitations, and its statistical basis. also it's assumptions has never been clearly stated. that is not a scientic method. my guess is linearity & continuity of the system. (i.e., no singularity of the configuration space of all variables) so the quality control studty can be reduced significantly.Furthermore, there's no bibliography of good references about the method, except the incestuous self-referencing.I also do not recommend the other book on Taguchi method by Dr. Taguchi et. al."
2,"Weak, But May Encourage Beginners","I agree with all the specific criticisms made, and these were precisely my impressions as well.This DVD suffers from exactly the same problem as the vast majority of instructional videos I have seen on any subject -- the rushed, one-shot commentary that is apparently ad libbed and at least somewhat unclear, confused and incomplete.It does give some useful tips to kids trying to do their first garage-grade music videos and is helpful for what it is."
2,Gets the job done but way overpriced,"I love the Apple remote for the convenience of controlling my Mac's media from afar...but it's outdated and severely overpriced. It's basically your standard IR remote, with 6 buttons, yet it's still 30 bucks, and it's the same Apple remote they've been selling for some time now. I would hope by now they would at least have a Bluetooth remote or something so we don't have to use the IR sensor on the Mac. Get it only if you absolutely need it because you lost your original remote (for Mac users)."
3,Just the same thing...,"I think that this remote has the advantage of the menu button, but this is only to lock the cradle with the remote. The functios are teh same like another controls that cost 10 dollars. The unique difference is that has the apple design (a little more quiality of the remote)"
1,This is a waste if you own the Ipod Video,I bought this for my Ipod 80 gig video and it was a complete waste of money. The Ipod Video doesn't support it and you are better to buy the plug in remote or the plug in remote with receiver.
1,Didnt work,"Unfortunately, this remote did not work with any of our Ipods. My son asked for a remote for his Ipod for Christmas and I purchased a generic one, but it worked with my Ipod classic, but not with his Ipod video. I thought if I purchased this remote because it was made specifically fot the Ipod, but it didnt even work with my Classic. Apple told me my Ipods were too old and wanted me to purchase newer ones, but my son decided it wasnt worth it and will live without a remote!"
2,you get what you pay for...,"We have owned our Apple TV for a little over a year now and are absolutely in love with it!!! Unfortunately in order to use an Apple TV you must also use this crappy little white remote that only seems to last for a month before it stops working all together. At first we thought that it might be the battery, nope. So we thought that it was a bad remote, so we ordered a new one. Long story short, here we are 6 replacement remotes later and I'm now ordering number 7. Apple should really rethink their design and opt for a pricier but more durable remote. However we have found that the Ipod touch remote feature works beautifully!"
3,This device may not be an exact duplicate of the Apple remote!,"My original white Apple remote, which was delivered with my iMac, works with everything on both my iMac and my Mac-mini. The white remote which was delivered to me by the Amazon third-party seller does not work with everything. Specifically, it does not work with the Pinnacle PCTV 80e HDTV tuner device that I use on my iMac.It DOES work with the Hauppauge HDTV tuner device that I use on my Mac-mini in another room. So I just switched the remotes. The new remote also works with iTunes and FrontRow, so the problem may be limited to a very specific situation.My problem is solved but I wanted others to be aware of an issue with this remote from a specific reseller and the commonly used Pinnacle PCTV 80e TV tuner device (aka, Pinnacle mini-tuner for Mac).It's impossible to tell the remotes apart, as they have the exact same printing on the back."
3,"does what it says, and nothing more","This handy little remote does work very well with my macbook (use it to play/pause videos), but since buying this I have learned there are other more expensive remotes that offer more features, like those that come with docking stations or those that are RF rather than IR...which I probably would have preferred but oh well I'm still gonna hold on to mine though because it is way cheaper than the other options."
1,This book is more Java for beginners than JSP,"This book is a disappointment to me, because it assumes that you know nothing at all about Java. So many pages are wasted explaining things about Java language constructs; where I expected the book to be about JSP as such. Also the description of how to install the JRun application server that comes with it on CD is not precisely correct."
3,Files cannot be run ...,"When I first read this book, I really glad I bought it because it is easy to follow. But now i have second thought. The source files for the entire chapter 12 cannot be run. It seems that there are mistakes in the written code. If anyone has figured out how to correct the problems, i would appreciate if you could kindly drop me a mail. The most annoying part of all, the publisher web site does not post any errata or forum whatsoever to answer readers' qury."
2,Pricing,"Expensive pricing for what you get and how much it makes. I can make more with heavy cream, gelatin or agar agar and coconut or almond flavoring"
4,Great jamming,"This, Sweet Smoke's third and, alas, last record consists of recordings of a gig in Berlin in 1973. This cd offers more music than the records available so far, as tracks 4-6 are added.All tracks are great jazz/rock workouts by superb musicians, although I was a little disappointed at the time as I found the record a bit lacking in inspiration compared to the first 2 records, thus verging towards a more familiar (and less unique) jazz/rock area. Never mind that, though - it still stands well above the efforts of comparable groups."
4,Very Unique!,This book was very different than the other BDSM books that I've read. I do agree with one of the other reviewers with saying that this wasn't one Hunter's best work. But I did enjoy it.
5,Fabulous!,"This book is funny as hell and hard to put down - can emphasis with someone who writes about her struggles with giving up smoking and drinking while living ""in the center of Manhattan, where I could get any substance I wanted delivered within twenty minutes""..."
1,Dear Diary...I read the worst book this week.,"This book should have been titled ""What People Who Need Therapy Act Like."" Absolutely nothing notable. Empty...cold...painful...Don't read without aspirin close by. The entire book reminds me of a hyper kid trying to tell you what they did today. Reads like a spastic journal of the self-absorbed. The only funny in the entire book ""quit people."" The entire little black dress beginnings and her various weighs. A waste of time."
5,hope for the hopelessly addicted,"as an ex-smoker, i found this fast-paced, fresh, hysterically funny take on addiction to be right on target. shapiro's got a knack for making keen, insightful observations, particularly on family and the nature of dependency - the hilarious scene where she goes back home to see her parents and brothers after getting clean really rings true. but Lighting Up is more than just a book about substance abuse - it chronicles the universal struggle to be a sane, functioning human being in this crazy world."
4,I enjoyed this honest memoir,"I have had mixed feelings about Susan Shapiro's previous book.However, because of the subject matter, I picked up this one with some hope.I need not have worried. While the first few pages are a little weird (i.e. the therapist basically tells the couple what date to get married - and they do) this memoir is fresh and honest.Shapiro takes a frank look at her addictions - starting with cigarettes only to discover that she has many more than she thought (see title).Shapiro writes in a refreshing way and does not mince words when necessary. She manages to keep the tone of the story serious but fun and interesting at the same time. She is not overly dramatic (which often happens in memoirs) and basically, gives up a few pointers on how to overcome our additions.I thoroughloy enjoyed this book."
1,Who Cares?,"Who Cares?, August 14, 2006Reviewer: publishedtoo (Portland) - See all my reviewsI am a therapist and addictions counselor. I found this to be a boring, overblown account of giving up smoking written by a spoiled narcissist. This book diminishes the anguish suffered by clients with full blown addictions. Quiting smoking isn't easy. I know. I've done it, but a whole self indulgent book about it? ...Pleazzze."
4,Indian Don,"This is an older work but still worth a listen. When compared to his more recent offerings you can see how he has improved over time, would say like a fine wine but we are talking about Mike Rayburn here! Would love to see him live."
5,awesome!,i loved the show it was way better than what i thought i loved alois and the hard case was awesome must buy for black butler fans ......i loved the OVA's too!
5,FANTASTIC! You will not regret buying this!!!!,This anime is amazing in Japanese AND in English. Funimation casted the characters very well in this series. Totally worth it :D
3,More disturbing,"Yes, I know it's dark- yes, I know the first was dark too. I loved the first so I had to have the second season. I miss the zany crazies of the first season. The crazy characters we met in the first only make cameo like appearances. The dark like part of the first was doubled in the second. I have a hard time with violence against children. The story does a great job of explaining how Ciel lived past the first season. The last episode of season two made the whole thing worthwhile. I did not recognize Luci Christian as she usually plays younger boys; she did such a fabulous job. I will listen to Brina and Michael in any project."
4,Black Butler Season 2,"I am a huge fan of Black Butler and can't get enough of it. Season 2 is pretty good but like most sequels, it isn't as good as the first season. There's a lot of action and the story is good but the drawing of this season seemed a little lazy to me at some parts and frankly annoyed the crap out of me compared to the quality of the first season. Although, I suppose that could be contributed to the fact that the second season is on bluray. Overall, it's worth buying just be prepared that it isn't as great as season 1, not by a long shot."
4,Awsome anime,"This would get five, except for the ending. Don't worry, no spoilers! lol. Still an awsome series, I just feel bad for one of the characters in how it ends....lol. The second season is a bit darker and grittier than the first season, and a bit more blatent in it's sexual inuendo in some respects, which some might take issue with. Otherwise, if you liked season one, you can't go wrong with season two!!!!!"
5,AWESOME!,"The box set is better than I expected, with one side picturing Sebastian and Ciel and the other side having Claude and Alois. The material of the box is also better than I expected and I am very happy with this product! So if you haven't watched the first season, I would advise you don't watch the second one just yet, but both seasons are so worth it!"
5,Awesome,"Ive been a long fan of black butler, the DVDs played well and the box was nice. It came with all the ovas and even had the voice actors talk about the show. Nice thanks"
4,Pretty Cool,"I was excited to hear that this season of Black Butler was coming out on DVD in the U.S. because I tried looking everywhere online for the OVAs and could find some of them, but not all. This was the selling point for me!I had watched this season already once before I bought this, and can say that I liked it because of the return of a lot of my favorite characters --Grell :3-- but I feel like it ended like a bad fan fiction. That's just my opinion though. This season is definitely radically different from the first, which follows the manga to some extent, for those of you familiar with that. However, this one is still wildly entertaining, and includes new characters and another sexy demon butler, so I would suggest it to anyone who's a fan of the series!I was also pleased that it contained both DVD and Blu-ray! A must have for any anime or Black Butler fan!"
4,Black butler 2: More please?,"Overall it was a good series, I feel that some of the episodes were filler episodes. And the fact that your HAD to buy the blue ray combo was annoying and a waste of money. With all that said I am happy with my purchase"
5,Gift,I bought this for my granddaughter and she just Loved It! She got the first season last year and really wanted the 2nd.
5,good video,My sister loves the series and Ilove the seriesAnd I love To try to get more dvds on this site
2,MAD,there were broke parts as soon as i took them out of the box and some do not even stand without support!!! detail is great but the rest sucked!!!! and it took like 2 weeks to receive!!!!! ill post a video review soon
4,crunchy sweet goodness,I really like Jejune. Their first album is much diferent from their second and I feel this one is a little bit raw sounding and their second one is softer and more manicured and has audio effects. This album doesn't have audio effects just good lyrics and a great background sound. Do try it.
5,nice cable,The thickness of this cable is the same as the one that came with my Jabra headphones. I use this cable to extend the listening range. Very nice fit and sound quality at a relatively low price.
4,Works,"Just got the item, came 2 days early :DDoes exactly what I needed it for.My only complaint is that it doesnt snap when you connect it in. So it will pull out a bit if you snug itAnd the wire is reallly thin, but it doesnt deplete the audio."
5,Perfectly great item,"The cord is thinner and softer than you'd expect (bordering on cheap, almost, which sometimes comes off as ""premium"" to some) but it works perfectly and doesn't seem to affect sound quality one bit. A great purchase if you need an extension that does both 1/4 jack and a mini-jack."
1,where is my wire?,"I ordered this headphone extension wire on March 31,2009 from Brainstorm Corporation through Amazon... I paid extra money to have it shipped faster in just 2 days... I got an email right away telling me they got my money. Its now April 3rd (3 days later) and I still have no email telling me that my order has shipped, no email telling me the tracking number and no way to tell when it will be delivered. I contacted this seller a day ago and they responded immediately telling me they would find my order and tell me the day it shipped (if it did) and my tracking info and delivery estimate.They never emailed back! So I contacted them again and now I am waiting here with no wire still.So far, I would say if you know this is a good product, buy it from a different store. This seller (Brainstorm Corporation) doesn't seem to keep track of customers or orders very well."
5,Perfect Solution,"The Sony extension cord for headphones works especially well and makes my husband happy when I'm watching movies late at night. This works with my computer, DVD player and stereo. This cord also works with the AKG headphones and the K240 version makes everything sound amazing. The cord is lightweight and the nine feet extension makes it much easier to enjoy music a little further from the source. Now I can sit on the other side of the room and watch a movie on my computer or enjoy late night movies without disturbing my husband.~The Rebecca Review"
1,Broke after a month,"This cable worked perfectly for about a month, but now no sound comes out of the left side. If I wiggle the cable at the connector, I can get sound sometimes, but the cable is basically unusable.I purchased this particular cable over other cheaper varieties because I hoped it'd be of higher quality, so this is pretty disappointing."
4,Great extension; hinders higher end headphones though.,"This is very nice for adding length to any pair of headphones. I have one pair however that is a professional pair and there is a slight difference in sound quality to the trained ear. I do emphasize the trained ear part because it is very slight and most people might not notice. However for those of you looking for an extension for professional headphones, this is not the one for you."
4,thin. but light.. good sound quality,"some people have complained about the wires being too thin. this is a positive and negative. the thinness of the wire makes them very light. they dont pull down on my headphones. they are also very flexible and easy to manage. very comfortable to deal with. however, being thin cables. they are weaker. keep them out of traffic and they will be fine. i found the sound quality to be fine. did not notice any difference. but i dont use expensive $200 headphones either"
4,Does the job,"When I first got it, I was skeptical of how thin the cable was. I'm still a little worried about durability for the long term, but it hasn't had any noticeable effect on sound quality. The connectors seem solid, so as long as it doesn't degrade over time, definitely a good buy."
5,Best damn tweeters on the Market,"For the price, best damn tweetersOut there. They will only work onA amp. My alpine head unit couldn'tMake any sound come out. SoundIs surpurb in my single cab truck.Only thing I didn't like is on bumpyRoads they come un done from thereHolders but nothing super glue orThe two sided tape they give you can't fixRight. Buy these tweets you be sorry youPaid too much for other brands.I will buy these for all my vechiles."
5,muy bueno,"me encanta la calidad, muy buen producto es todo lo que esperaba, al montar esto en mi vehículo suena con una claridad tremenda"
1,Quantum Mind of the Gullible,"I found this to be likely designed for specific target audience groups: those who like to indulge in recreational pharmaceuticals while watching a DVD, and/or those who found books on Dianetics to be life changing.Between the screen-saver like graphics, and the mumblings of the narratorwhich were often hard to distinguish from the loud background music, it is easy to find the appeal to the former target group.The excessive use of syllogisms, elliptical, deductive and inductive arguments make the case for its design and marketing to the latter group.All in all, I would have to say, if you do not think you fall into one of the above groups, you would likely find better use of your time and entertainment/educational dollar.~Just my tuppence. Your mileage may vary."
1,Beware: Worst Rip-off - Terrible Content!,"Beware of purchasing this ""product"".What you get is NOT a DVD but a homemade styled disk containing a wmv file featuring swirling psychedelic visuals, poor music and even worse narration. The disk will NOT play on many DVD players (on a PC it will function due to the format) - If I wanted to pay this amount of money for such a product I would just sit and listen to some real music or other narration while watching the MS Windows visualizer screen.And the product does not explain any of this to you on the product box.I took it back, got a refund, and the store removed the existing product from it's shelves.Perhaps if you took the time and effort to create a proper and professional documentary then your materials might have some value.I just wish that I had the ability to give this a -5 stars - that is what it deserves.Purchaser BEWARE!"
5,Quantum Mind of God,"What an interesting film about us, our universe and how we are connected. Quantum physics connects us to God. The universe is just like our brain so we are connected to the universe. We understand our true state of knowing but our mind is cluttered with things that don't matter so we can't use it. I am truly amazed by quantum physics and our capability and human beings."
4,"Beautiful, Artistic, Stunning","I would be remiss if I did not mention the beauty and artsy vibe of this visually stunning movie. The information expressed is yet another version of artistic interpretation. Gardiner's questions and answers require another type of faith, one in Gardiner's ideas and research. Worth the time and thought."
5,Lots of hot code snippets,"This is precisely the book I wanted as I started getting more complicated with VB.NET. Thank you Karl, Apress and Amazon... what code snippets!"
2,too popular,"The content is ok, however the writing style of Karl Moore is really bad. He tries to be funny whole the time. The first few pages I thought it would be ok, however he continues until the very last page of the book.Example: ""I'm really pleased you're sticking with the tutorials. You're obviously one of the few people that truly arent't offended by my smell"" and "" Well, hurrah and hujjah on coming this far"" and ""So a round of applause and well done once again! <cheer>"". You get this type of information every second sentence. It really distracts you from the content and it gets really annoying. Otherwise, it would be a good book (with 100 pages less)."
2,Not Primarily a VB.NET book,"From the title and initial reviews, I was hoping for a book that explained VB.NET methods simply, without a lot of the MS techno-speak. This book turned out to be geared more for ASP developers, particularly using SQL Server databases. I am using Oracle with VB.NET and have found little to justify spending money on this book. Very disappointing. To compound the injury, the book is very loosely organized."
2,Poorly Organized- did not provide any useful code for me,"This book is a rambling treatise of unrelated code that is impossible to navigate.The code inside here could be written by any intermediate programmer.Very disappointed, not sure where all the 5 stars come from. I sent it back."
5,"great book for source code, but not for beginners","You can find great code snippets and how-to's in this book, which will save you time for sure. However, this book is not for beginners."
5,Carry this book at all times,I have 50 pounds of .NET books. This is the only one that always has the answers I need. It explains every technique in one or two pages instead of the 50 pages that most authors seem to prefer. The author is obviously a developer. He cuts right to the solution every time. I'll definitely look for his books first everytime I add to my collection. Definitley buy this book.
5,Use just one of two examples and this book pays for itself!,"I love this book. When I am not looking for an immediate solution to my .Net issues, I am skimming it to pick up some new techniques. Excellent code and explanations. Great for vb.net and asp.net beginners and seasoned programmers who want to save themselves time."
5,The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas,"This is the only film with Dolly Parton and Burt Reynolds in it together that I know of. When this movie first came out I was surprised to say the least, but after watching it I really like it. Dolly and Burt never looked better. There is nothing dirty going on in this movie. There is a bit of nudity but not as much as in most movies nowaday. There is some swearing but again not as much as in all movies now. This is just a classic movie to have in your collection to bring back some memories."
2,Questionable value,The real value of this book appears to be its short term strategies. These are strategies one may employ when college is approaching. Its long term strategies are nothing more than what you'd find in Money Magazine or similar periodical. My advice is to wait and purchase this book until you're within five years of enrolling in college.
4,Paying for College aka Surviving the FAFSA,"This book helped me to walk step by step through the financial aid process that colleges demand. There are forms in the back that made doing the FAFSA a lot less onerous than it seemed at first. It has areas of instruction for private as well as state funded schools. It explains what you have to tell the schools that you have financially, what you don't and why. Also is very helpful in advising you how to negotiate with the colleges after their first financial aid offer comes through. Neither of my children would have been able to attend the institutions they are currently in without the financial advise I got from this book."
5,A great artist in a poorly planned book.,"Sometimes, the problem with an artbook is not the artwork, but the size of the images and the sketches. When I buy a book like this I don't expect to find thumbnails inside or even half page pictures and sketches. In my opinion, Royo deserves one painting per page and every now and then a two-page spread.With III Millennium you don't get exactly that.As for Royo's art, whether it's sombre, erotic, futuristic or medieval, it is always top quality, and its most unique characteristic is, undoubtedly, the way he handles light - the reader's eyes are literally drawn to whatever he whishes.SPECIFICS:Page Count: 80Number of images: 80Small images: 37Half page images: 6Full page images: 262-page spreads: 11BW images: 21TEXT:1 page introductionSmall paragraphs about the chapter's topic throughout the bookTitle and year of some paintingsART:17 images: 5 stars22 images: 4 stars30 images: 3 stars9 images: 2 stars2 images: 1 starOverall: 3,5 stars"
1,Not Reliable,"Product will not withstand actual use conditions. Seals, esp. on battery, are insufficient to prevent intrusion of water and humidity. Battery case is not water-resistant. Other seals, on DC-in port, microphone tap, etc. are prone to dislodge, allowing water water vapor entry. Unit needs a dry bag to protect it, particularly if one is kayak-bound. Because this is the case, one is just as well off with a non-submersible unit in a dry bag."
4,Battery indicator,"Very good VHF. The sound is great, simple operation, but doesn't have a basic battery charge indicator. I didn't use yet up to the total discharge of the battery, and don't know if it has any notice about charging need."
3,Interested in broadcasting and Texas? This book's for you!,"A mostly-successful survey of the early years of radio and television in Texas, the book is filled with interesting anecdotes, particularly with respect to the construction of WBAP-TV in Fort Worth, the first television station in the Lone Star State. Among the book's imperfections: it is rather sloppily edited, and the author's bias against the University of Texas is evident. But I would expect no better from a publication emanating from Texas A & M."
2,Not As Described,"The item description says its 6"" in length. The package clearly states 4"" in length for the product I received. Not worth returning something this cheap but beware."
4,Good introduction to acrylics,"For someone just starting acrylic painting, I thought this was a good introductory book. It describes acrylics, materials (such as brushes) and various techniques. I thought the sample projects were a little complicated for a beginner. The rest of the book seemed geared to someone just starting acrylics, but the projects seemed more advanced."
1,Damaged - no stars,"I was so disappointed to receive this DVD. First it took 5 attempts to get my player to ""read"" it. Then when it finely did play, pixils were visable, the music was skipping and a full 2 minutes into it, it stopped dead. I never heard any narration - maybe there isn't supposed to be, which my husband and I thought strange for a travel DVD. He also thought what we did see didn't amount to much. There isn't much up to date tourist information about Norway out there. And apparently there still isn't !"
