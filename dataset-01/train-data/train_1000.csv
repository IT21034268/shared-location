4,Helpful,"Actually, it was much bigger than i eaxpected, but the size became a great help. My little girl likes the idea of being able to push it around as her daily exercise. Also it can be used as a substitute for a high chair or even to relax. The variety offered by the mini maestro keeps her occupied for long periods. What is really great about this Tiny steps is that it's safe for the child as she is not able to switch from room to room without your assistance"
1,Boo-hiss :(,"This book was disappointing. It's title lead me to believe that it would be an extensive and thorough compilation of most, if not all of the bikes Schwinn produced; not so!I own a 1970 Schwinn Twinn Tandem bike, and was hoping I would read and see information on tandems. They picture one tandem, and have very little information about it. They also fail to depict several other models. If you look at an orignal Schwinn catalog, you'll find that they built dozens of models each year! Do a google search and you'll find it.One of Schwinn's more popular models was the ""Typhoon"", and I don't even see a mention of it! What a crock!I have a Standard Catalog of Corvette, and it's is much more thorough than this one for the bike."
2,Schwinn book...very basic info.,Ok book...lotsa color pics....needs more Sting Ray pics and information. Has some factual errors in it but if you get this book cheap it's worthwhile. There are better books out there though. I use tghis book only as a backup for my other Schwinn books...to get different views on Schwinns I happen to be restoring at any given time. I would not use it as my main Schwinn book though.
2,Catalog Shmatalog,"I browsed through this book at a local bike shop. It had some nice photos but it is not a ""Catalog"" by any stretch of the imagination. Save your money and do some Google searching and you will get more information than this book presents."
5,The Best of Hawaiian Falsetto!,"As a new student of Hula, I have been listening to lots of Hawaiian music, and learned about Dennis Pavao in his earlier recordings with Hui Ohana. In my humble opinion, Dennis is the king of Hawaiian falsetto. He sings with soul and emotion. Na Mele Nenoheno means ""most cherished songs"" in Hawaiian, and the songs chosen for this album are very special indeed. You won't regret buying this album."
2,Very sad day in Hawaii,I just want to inform all you Dennis Pavao fans that the greatest falsetto singer in Hawaii passed away on Jan 18 2002. This is a great loss to lovers of Hawaiian music.
4,Great Belt Display for Tang Soo Do,"My kids practice Tang Soo Do, and this belt display rack is very nice because in our system the kids don't get 10 belts but just 5 (white, orange, green, red, blue/black) so you can customize the number of belts you choose to hang and display underneath of a great picture frame. The product was easy to assemble. I recommend it."
5,Fascinating Christian historical fiction.,"Third in the ""Zion Chronicles"" series of Christian based historical fiction, the book graphically portrays the various forces in play at the time of the founding of the modern nation of Israel. Compelling reading with believable characters."
3,"Very good book by the late Rabbi Elmer Berger, crusader v. Zionist-",NAZIism. Well written book which cangive any reader a proper view of thetragety of modern Israel. Highlyrecomended but not totally perfect.Definately take Judaism over Zionism!
1,Don't buy this book!,"I am a big Bogle and Vanguard Fan, and I say this as a shareholder. But this is a big waste of time, unless you like reading transposed speeches. Anyone looking for a in depth look into the development and early days of the Vanguard Group as Bogle transitioned from Princeton...to Wellington Renegade will be horribly disappointed. I know I was.It's ironic that the cover of the book doesn't allude to it's content...copies of speaches. I guess ""Character Counts"" only when your dealing with other people's money...Go Vanguard!"
2,Too repetitive,"I respect Mr. Bogle for what he has done for the mutual fund industry, however, I think he could have left his mark on this world without publishing this book. One can only read so many speeches where the same topic is discussed over and over again. Invest your money in Vanguard funds, but not this book."
5,"Beautiful, difficult, exciting film.","In the theater, it was such a fascinating thing to watch. Particular images and sounds still stick with me three years later! Godard enthusiasts will love it, those who like to think on their own (or so they think) will love it. And I love it, too."
4,Nice Soundtrack!,"This soundtrack is really cool if you like the show Taina. Most of the songs are taken from the second season, that's the only part I don't like. Otherwise, buy it!"
1,Product is not a volex product,"The product title was stated As volex, however when I recieved the product it was not a Volex product and it was very cheap. Therefore, it broke within 2 weeks"
1,DON'T BUY THE PRODUCT FAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!,don't buy the product first it is a fake one it is not volex and second I got a broken one....it lasted a week for me than it broke.... save your money don't buy it
2,She ain't no Annie Haslam!,"Imagine the Rolling Stones without Mick Jagger. Well, that's Renaissance without Annie Haslam. The only thing that makes this CD even marginally tolerable is that some of Michael Dunford's compositions are passable tunes. However, the quality of Dunford's works only makes me yearn even more to hear Annie's voice singing them. Try as I might, even by closing my eyes, I can NOT accept another voice singing his works. Without Haslam's miraculous voice giving life to his tunes, Dunford is at best treading water with this feeble effort. If you're truly a Renaissance fan, go buy Annie's solo works instead."
1,This was painful to read!,"I have always loved Judith Krantz's work and have read just about everything she has written. Sadly, I had to force myself to finish this tome. The characters are flat and bland, and the story is just plain uninteresting. It was a total waste of time and money. You want to read great Krantz, read Mistral's Daughter, Scruples I & II, I'll take Manhattan (especially juicy) or the Jewels of Tessa Kent."
1,no show,"I so would like to write a review, but alas the book Princess Daisy was to arrive on July 20th and I have yet to receive it. Where oh where is the Princess?"
2,Thank god for the cover,"It came as no small relief when I finally got to the end of this book. I think I would have preferred having bowel surgery in the woods with a stick than even contemplating reading this. The only remotely interesting thing to do is to laugh at the disastrous writing style. At one point there is about have a page describing Daisy's lips. All very well but we do all already know what lips look like. Perhaps the most depressing thing is the characterisation, you either have the good character: Daisy, or somebody else. It is painfully obvious that Judith Krantz has little or no writing talent but us simply copying someone else's style, for them for it painted an artful picture, for her it is a whole lot of uselss adjectives."
3,Would have been twice as good were it half as long.,"This book was a diverting ""guilty"" pleasure to read. (I never liked that expression because I never feel guilty about reading trashy novels.) However, it really didn't need to be as long as it was. The thing that added all the unnecessary length was Krantz's insistence on giving us pages of background information on characters who are completely tangential to the plot. We get all kinds of introductions to and sex scenes between characters who simply do not matter. The book is supposed to be about Princess Daisy, based on the title, but her story only takes up 2/3 of it.I like Krantz's writing style, because it's wildly over the top and often makes me laugh. However, she does have a tendency to just run on and on about things once she's already made her point. In the interest of NOT following in her footsteps, I will end this review."
4,Trashy Romance and Nostalgia,Read this years ago as a pre-teen and enjoyed it thoroughly. It was not diminished by time and me growing up.
3,Manual for set-up,The manual was extremely short on illustrations and instructions. Batteries difficult to install. Leveling instructions did not match product. Had to contact manufacturer twice and answers not always complete. Got it set up but no rain to test. May use the sprinkler when I get time.
4,Pudo haber sido mejor!!,"Con la colaboracion de Warner Latina, este cd+dvd promocional del canal HTV por lo menos en el cd trae una buena seleccion de temas, lamentablemente en el dvd incluye solo 6 videos (todos estos videos estan disponibles en otros dvds que Warner ha sacado al mercado, asi que no son muy novedosos que digamos...) aun asi es un bonito ""souvenir"" para todas las personas que han disfrutado de la programacion y han hecho de este canal uno de sus favoritos"
1,Totally Disappointing,"I have all of ""The Cat Who..."" books but this is the last one I'll get. It doesn't end...it just stops, with nothing resolved. It's almost like the first few chapters of a promising book. Whoever writes these now just doesn't have what it takes."
1,worthless,"I have read a few of the ""Cat"" books and enjoyed them. This book, however, tempted me to throw it in the trash several times. I just can't do that without finishing a book, so I did. There was never a mystery...simply a ridiculous book, riding on the laurels of some of the other ""Cat"" books."
2,Series is a shadow of its former self,"The Cat Who Series has been delighting readers for many years, but perhaps it has outlived its welcome at this point. In the latest installment, Quill's K Foundation is bankrolling a new bookstore which will be run by his lady love, Polly, the former librarian of Pickax. All of the usual characters are in the book, along with Alden Wade, a smooth operator who has just moved to town. He charms the locals and ends up marrying one of the wealthiest women in town under suspicious circumstances. His stepson appears briefly in the book, but makes a hasty exit before he does much to impact the story. Alden seems to be a lethal husband as two of his wives die, but there is no resolution in the book, just a lot of questions written in Quill's journal at the end. Braun is at her best when she writes of the gentle interactions of Quill and his friends, but the well-constructed mysteries of her early books have been absent for some time."
3,Major disapointment!,"I was merrily reading along, enjoying the trip, when it just stopped!I actually looked to see if there were pages missing! I like answers!"
3,No Climax,"I agree with Anne Melvin's review. The book drove us to a cliff and then just pushed us off without telling us why. Unfortunately, this has been happening for the last 2 or 3 books, but this is the worst case so far. It feels as though the author is too exhausted to finish the book, so she just ends it prematurely. I have read and will continue to read all of the books in this collection because I adore the characters and am attached to the series, but I find myself more and more disappointed with each book. I fear that Ms. Braun has been secretly replaced or she is loosing her steam."
1,No ending! What happened!,"This book, though not as exciting as previous ones, started out interesting, then ended with lots of unanswered questions. What happened? Where's the mystery in this series? My advice to the publishers is to can this series if it can't be comparable to the first 20 or so. I've read the reviews. No one likes this series anymore. It's boring and it is devoid of suspense.You don't even use Koko's abilities anymore! Who cares if he left banana peels? Other than the title, how is that contributing to solving the case? This one was so predictable! You knew the Hibbard House would burn down at the end! What a waste of the paper they printed this one on!"
2,The Ending Drove Me Bananas,"I've enjoyed ""The Cat Who . . . "" books and enjoy seeing what the characters get into next.I got to the end of this book and turned the page thinking there would be another few pages to tie up loose ends. I shared with a friend how annoyed I was to find that actually WAS the end. She suggested I write the publisher and ask why they forgot to print the ending. :-)Extrememly disappointed with the final pages of this book."
1,Going from bad to worse,"I read most of the reviews concerning this book, and all of the ones I read voiced the same sentiments as I felt. I too think it is time to end the Cat Who series, before it hits rock bottom. Perhaps it already has. I have felt for some time that Mrs. Braun must have a ghost writer, and one who is not truly a ""cat person."" There is not the ""feeling"" about the cats that came out in her earlier books. They were ""real"" in the beginning, now they are just ""props."""
3,If felt tighter but still lacked substance,"I didn't feel that this book rambled on nearly so much as the last couple which just seemed to go on and on without going anywhere, and was actually relatively happy until the end which I found completely disappointing. I am ready for Qwill to finger a baddy again. It seems like it's been a while.I agree with an earlier reviewer don't tease me about Celia. I think she's my favorite chraracter and we never hear from her anymore. And don't tease me about Polly and Qwill splitting up. Violet sounded great for Qwill. I was hoping we were finally going to get the end of the Queen of the Boring People, but alas no, on for one more :(."
3,What happened to the ending?,I have read or listened to everyone of The Cat Who series and loved all the rest. This has the same formula with the clues from Koko and Quill's mustache moving the plot and building anticipation but then it ends with all the questions unanswered!A terrible ending!
2,Where's the story?,"A woman is murdered by her husband, or not. A widower is really a fortune hunter, or not. Polly is too attracted by a new man in town, and too distracted by her new job, to find time for Qwill -- or not. I kept waiting for this story to really take off, and it never did. Qwill is charming. Koko is devious and mysterious, the town is endearing ... but alas, there's no real point to this story."
1,READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE YOU ORDER!!,"I wish I had and saved the money.The latest offering by Ms. Braun leaves me feeling like the well is dry. The last couple of ""Cat Who"" books haven't lived up to the past delightful offerings.This one has no mystery, no plot, and an anticlimactic ending that leaves you wondering if it is a ""to be continued"" or what.I think this is the last ""Cat Who"" book I will buy. Ms. Braun should retire if this is all she has to offer. Disappointing is the only word to use to describe The Cat Who Went Bananas.Save your money."
2,It's just not the same...,"I have been a ""Cat"" fan for years, and will continue to buy the latest book. I do believe, that someone is ghost writing for Lilian Jackson Braun (and I suspect that this has been the case since ""The Cat Who Robbed the Bank""). While I applaud their efforts, the books lack something...We don't hear about the cats as much, and Koko does not seem to be doing much in solving the crimes. I feel like I have been enjoying Dove Chocolates, and have been handed a sugar free, fat free, Hershey bar. A treat, but not as satisfying."
2,Too much of a good thing...,"The story doesn't flow; the characters no longer jive; the plot is left like road-kill on the shoulder; Even Koko and Yum Yum have taken long cat naps during this latest installation of TCW. What is going on?First of all let me say ""Kudos"" to LJB for bringing us at least 20-stories that have been absolutely amazing! After ""TCW Sang for the Birds"" the stories began getting a bit wonky; and then after book 23 ""TCW Smelled a Rat"" things just went sour for me. I have read all 27 books now (I even have TCW cookbook!) and I have to say that it might be time to bring the saga of TCW to a happy ending..."
2,The Cat Who Went Bananas,"This is the first one of the ""Cat Who..."" books that I have read. I thought this book was going to get really good but it never did. I thought it was kind of boring because it really didn't have a point. It just rambled on and on. This book was only a little interesting when Quill was interviewing people for things to put in the book he is writing. This book was mostly boring though again becase it had no point, it would go to one subject and then not carry on with that and go to something completely different. Overall this book was just okay."
1,Cats sleep a lot. They must have read this book.,"Obviously, Braun has struck gold with her cat series; this is her 27th cat book. It is the first of the 27 that I have read, and the last. Nothing every happens, which is too bad because it is peopled with very interesting characters and a fabulous setting. There are also teasers of impending malfeasance, but they come to naught. Thankfully, it only took a day to read."
2,This is the one where I gave up collecting the series.,"I've followed ""The Cat Who"" series from the beginning, but this is where it stops. There is no mystery, and, in my opinion the book rambles here and there. Even Qwill, not to mention the cats, has ceased to be an interesting character. I guess Lillian Brun has simply gotten too old to do more than hack away. It hurts a bit -- I've loved the series. And it's still better than some of the other modern mysteries I've read -- but only because I know and loved the characters. Anyhow, I won't be buying any of the new ones."
5,better than Somenex!!!,"I borrowed the CD version from the library and have been ""listening"" to it every night. I am the world's worst insomniac, but all I can say is, ""WOW!"" This audio book puts all my sleep and relaxation CD'S to shame! Such a boring tale--I barely heard any of it. I even tried listening to it when I was wide awake and sitting up, but it was still mind-numbing.On the other hand, I do look forward to reading one of Lilian Jackson Braun's HIGHLY RATED ""Cat who..."" books. I've always loved seeing them on display at Hastings, with the bright colors and clever graphics, but despite the ""eye candy"", they are not all so sweet. I'm glad to know that there are some great stories among Braun's ""Cat Who..."" books. Isn't that what makes amazon reviews so helpful? (click ""yes"")"
2,Not again!,"Why do I buy these books? Yes, I know that they are ""bubble gum"" mysteries, good flavor for a short time. All the author succeeded in doing was creating new mysteries to be solved at some future time.....we hope! As did other reviewers, I hoped that the Qwill love life had finally gotten to another phase, but alas, she killed Violet almost immediately. So many loose ends, such disappointment.Only the cats know certain."
2,Bananas or nuts?,"Like other reviewers I found this story lacking it's usual charm. The characters are stuck in time and are not developing. Writing a series is tough for that reason. The stories need to be interesting and the characters need to grow and change as real people do. The last few books in this series have been disappointing.After saying that, I do enjoy and look for to each new addition. A new reader to the series probably would not enjoy these books if they start reading the later books."
1,The Senile Siamese...,"Like the other reviewers, I am a ""Cat Who..."" fan. But also like them, I found the Banana Cat has really slipped. Who cares? This latest is an example of formula writing written only for the formula--not to add anying to the world of entertainment, intellect, feeling, or art. It's a disappointment of the highest order, and LJB should be encouraged to let the series die in peace, with whatever little dignity may be left."
1,The Cat Who Needs a new Author,"The book just stopped... No questions were answered, no deaths explained, no mysteries solved. While I enjoyed reading the book and learning about new characters and glad to see mention of some of my favorite (Celia Robinson), I was dumbfounded at the ending. I hope that Ms. Braun will not let this be her last TCW book - it is a wonderful series that I have enjoyed for many years - but it almost seems that she starting writing a story, with no real plot in mind, and when she reached the mandated number of pages, she just stopped...."
2,Braun went Bananas,"The author is one of my favorites until these last few books. This latest one, ""The Cat Who Went Bananas"", left much to be desired. The story was thin, the cats involvement was minimal, and Mr. Q was pretty wishy-washy with Polly. All in all I didn't care for this one very much. Ms. Braun's earlier books were more vibrant, delightful twists of tale, and cute interaction of cats, townspeople, and Mr. Q. This time it was just plain ol' dull. Sorry, but this book was a major disappointment."
1,too many exclamation points!!!!,"I was looking forward to reading the latest in the series. I struggled to get get past the first few pages. The other books were engaging and perfect for an easy read during rainy or cold days when one wants just simply to be entertained. I suspect the author just 'spit out' the formula and added exclamation points after every other sentence. Nothing about the writing seemed like the author was even interested in writing this story, so I couldn't get engaged in it. Hopefully, she'll be more interested in writing the next one, or simply retire the poor fellow in Moose County."
3,The cat went bananas? Not in my copy of the book he didn't,"Very disappointing actually. I've read lots of 'The Cat Who ...' books and this one was quite unlike any of the others. The plot elements did not tie together and people, who seemed mysterious and interesting, disappeared or died. And the banana peel, which could clearly have been used to great comic effect, made a single very brief appearance and was barely mentioned again.Very poor. I gave it 3 out of 5 because it reads well *but* and this is a big butt ;-) there is no closure to any of the mysteries introduced."
2,"Not as bad as the last few books, but still not very good","Im giving this one 2 stars-- it is a step back in the right direction. It is better than the last few books that preceded it-- they were 1 star disappointments.I'm still hoping that someday the series will return to the 4 and 5 star examples from the beginning of the series.Liek many others, I'm a big fan, but a disappointed one. I'm not complaining about the story lines, per se, but the way the author's development and delivery of the story has gone downhill to such a degree. The elements are there to write a good book- enough characters and events are introduced at the start. What is so disappointing is that all this potential is wasted-- we get another ""alnost nothing happens"" plot instead. Writing about events like Qwill going out to dinner (again!) seems to be the point now-- as opposed to advancing a plot line."
2,What happened?,"All members of my family are long time fans of The Cat Who Series, reading and more recently listening to audio tapes and CD's of all the series. Yes, they are sometimes a little corny, sometimes a wee bit predictable, but always thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable. We wait anxiously each year for each new publication and found The Cat Who Went Bananas to be pleasurable listening. That is, until the ending, which left us wondering if our attention had lapsed and we had missed something. I ran the last tape back and listened to it again, but was left with the same thought of ""What happened?"". My wife, who had listened to it earlier, confided that she had also re-listened to the end of the last tape for the same reason and had the same question. I do not recommend this book to first time readers of The Cat Who series. I can only hope that this book was just a glitch and future publications will not leave us hanging, wondering ""What Happened?""."
2,"not the old standard for Ms, Braun","All the characters we love are featured in this book and it's a bit better than the previous ""Cat who"" novel, but maybe it is time to retire them and begin a new adventure with new characters. It seems there were many juicy directions for this book to explore, but none were actually pursued. Why did Violet get ill so quickly? Why wasn't more explored on ""Kenneth/Wesley's? part in the novel, and as for the Wix brothers? what was the real purpose? Was the fire really an accident of nature or arson? hmm. so many questions.And as for the Polly/ Qwill question, it seemed to me the relationship, so vitual to all other novels, was overlooked and added as a mere passing note.There are some really good thoughts in this book, i wish more had been explored.One final note, Ko ko and Yum Yum were hardly featured through-out. a shame since the novels became famous for them!"
1,Nothing Happens,"The whole book just meandered from the get-go, never going anywhere. One could surmise early who would be killed and who the killer would be, but the murder was certainly an afterthought.I'm also tired of Qwill's relationship with the boring Polly. And the great number of times he mentions his mustache.A great disappointment!-- Pat"
2,slow book,i read this book for a school project and it was so slow. nothing exciting happened for the first 190 pages. it seemed like everything came together in the last 15 pages. it ended so quickly. overall the book was so-so but it was suppoded to be a mystery .i didn't think that it was to mysterious.
2,Don't want to give up,"I have enjoyed The Cat Who books for many years, but I am consistently being disappointed in the recent books. There is just too many jumps from one character to another with no real reason for them to be in the book. Too many stories for Qwill's books. But, my main irritation is the going no where romance with Qwill and Polly! Come on, liven things up and let them have more romance and even possibly marry! That would make a good come back."
1,Dreadful!,"I have read and reread all of her other books most of which I enjoy. This however is simply terrible, if I could rate it less than one star I would! There were 4 deaths, a kidnaping, a disapearance and not one of these were solved! I felt like I was reading rough notes that were thrown together by a very bad editor. skip this one mystery fans its not worth the price!"
1,Is the end in sight?,"I had to give this 1 star because that was the lowest the drop down screen went. It's time to end this series and put us all out of our misery. Beginning is hopeful and then....it just ends, leaving many loose threads and secondary characters who literally just disappear. What exactly was the mystery? Who out there couldn't see who the 'bad guy' was? It's becoming painful!"
5,Fall Comes to Pickax,"It is autumn again in Pickax. Polly is staying busy getting the new bookstore opened. She and Qwill hardly have time for each other.Qwill decides to write a book about the Hibbard House for Violet Hibbard. Her house is very historical and was built many years ago by her great grandfather. Violet is a professor of English and Qwill invites her to dinner.Mystery follows mystery as Qwill and the cats move to town to prepare for winter.I liked this edition of ""The Cat Who.."" series. It made you think at the end. You don't want to miss this one."
5,AWESOME,"It is joy to know that we have another young gospel artist. One who has a gift from God to sing and minister to the young and old alike. I am almost fifty years old and ""Caught Up"" renews my spirit everytime I hear it. It is a daily reminder that one day I want to be ""Caught Up"". I pray that God will continue to keep them in His care and that they continue to do the will of the Lord. God bless this A-W-E-S-O-M-E group."
4,Black is good,"Like many people that are buying this product, they're probably fairly new to vinyl, and they were ready to spend a little more on a good cartridge. This was my case.I use a Pioneer PL-670 which is designated for P-Mount carts. Before buying the Grado, I was using the Audio-Technica 311 (which is pretty good and half the cost of the Black). After installing the Grado and testing it out (Morrison Hotel, 180 gram vinyl), I did a couple of comparisons, switching between the AT 311 and the Grado Black. Eventually I decided the Grado is a little cleaner and brings out more subtle details than the AT 311.Since then, the cart has grown on me, and I realize that the difference is there, and that it is better than my old cart; I guess I just thought I would be blown away on the first listen. However, needles take time to ""break in"" (at least that's what I'm told). I think next time, instead of upgrading in increments, I'll just make the big jump up to a high end cart."
2,"Stylus broke, bad hum","I got this because of its good reviews. I read about the terrible hum, and kind of disregarded it because I wanted a good cartridge for cheap. For about a month, it worked perfectly, then it started humming. Today (about 4 months after buying it) the stylus snapped in half while playing a record."
5,"In Rock, indeed","While other recent Minus 5 records (Down With Wilco and I Don't Know Who I Am) seemed a bit limp, In Rock reclaims the energy of Let The War Against Music Begin. Sure, that's probably because it was recorded nearer to the same time (though, so was I Don't Know Who I Am, but who's counting), but whatever. Most of the songs on this disc are up-tempo, and all of the songs have excellent harmonies and McCaughey's trademark weirdo lyrics.I'm a Young Fresh Fellows fan first and foremost, but ""In A Lonely Coffin,"" ""Where the Wires Meet the Sky,"" and the rest of the songs on this disc will tide me over until the Fellows decide to do another record. They will do another record, right?"
5,"McOi Still Has Nuggets Damage, And That's A Good Thing","Smart Garage Psych for Now People. As a reissue In Rock is an Original Artyfact from '00, but parts of it could just as well be from '66. This album features a great vintage keyboard sound, especially in Lies of the Living Dead and Dr. Evil. These two songs echo The Seeds and The Zombies, while others on here bring to mind Mott the Hoople, NRBQ, and SCOTS. Oh, and yes, the immortal Young Fresh Fellows. I saw the M5 live at The 3B in 2002, and well... what happens at a Minus 5 show stays at a Minus 5 show."
4,Pleased with fit,"Drawbar was not included as advertised so Amazon gave me a $28 credit.It cost $27 locally. It is a class 1 1-1/4"" which may be smaller than some acessories and require an adaptor. I am pleased with the overall fit. Dropping tailpipe/muffler was easy. I chiseled the pop rivets holding the heat shield and used a telescoping magnet to position the spacers."
3,Six good things to complain about,"After reading the author's first book, ""Eats, Shoots & Leaves,"" I had very high hopes for another smash hit. I was a bit disappointed since this book doesn't address how to improve our interaction with others, but rather, spends a great deal of time pointing out all that's wrong with society, and the main reasons the author would rather stay home and bolt the door. Although I agree with her criticisms, the wonderful wit and humor present in the first book is not found in this one. Looking for a great read with helpful information to improve yourselt, pick up the auther's first book, ""Eats, Shoots & Leaves."""
3,Rant-ish,"Amusing, but I didn't enjoy as much as Eats, Shoots and Leaves. Did make me want to read her columns."
2,Not very good at all.........returned it 3 days after...,"I am not questioning the authors knowledge of the subject. He seems to know a great deal about flash and actionscript. Unfortunately, knowledge does not always equate with clear concise writing and instruction. I am a software engineer, and have used javascript for random web projects. This book, and it's content confused me. Mainly because of the layout/lessons he uses. Either the book would move dreadfully slow, or the examples he uses were not explained well. Overall, I was really disappointed...."
2,Maybe good for ABSOLUTE beginners,"I read the reviews and thought this was going to be the ""magic bullet"" for Flash 5.0 actionscripting. I was sorely disappointed, this book would be great for someone who has zero or very little knowledge of Actionscripting. If however you have a decent understanding of the way Actionscripting is utilized then this book is not for you. It barely brushes the surface of the vast complexities that Actionscripting has become in Flash 5.0. This a a good book for someone who has no knowledge of the subject, but if you are looking for that next step in expanding your Actionscripting talents don't waste your time or money with this one."
5,A great way to learn action scripting,"This book is excellent, as is the before it in the series ""Foundation Flash 5"".The author, Sham Bhangal, takes his explanations of actionscripting a bit further than other authors I have read. Like other books, Foundation Actionscript has projects with examples of the scripting and explains what the script means, but this book also explains the thought processes and logic behind the writing of the code! The book does a good job of teaching the reader to take a problem and break it down into many smaller problems. In my opinion this makes Foundation Actionscripint superior to other books I have read on this subject.I highly recommend this book especially if you are new to object oriented programming. If you are new to Flash you should read Foundation Flash 5 (or some other book on the basics) first."
3,Average book. Does not really gell together very well.,"Being new to Flash 5 Action Scripting I needed a book that explained quickly and easily the concepts behind Flash 5 Action Scripting. Sham's books, although making the reader aware of many of the fundamental concepts does not really gel the whole idea of Action Scripting together. I am still having difficulty in understanding the concept of assigning variables and functions, etc. I am currently searching for another book on basic action scripting because I am still not confident in developing predominantly action-script based flash sites. I' m afraid to say it's one of those nice looking books that does not deliver."
3,Needs a bit more,"Every now and then this book leaves you hanging. Towards the middle of the book the author start to show you code with out much explanation or practice. Also at times you will build an exercise where he tells you what else you could possibly add to the script, but dose not actually do it and he dose not give enough information for you to actually perform the task on your owen. Example in chapter 8 controlling a soundObject, Sham will tell you that you can also add buttons to control the soundObject in order to stop the sound and then restart it. He dose not explain how or bother to tell you that there is more than just adding the script he gives you (which is lacking a few lines to ...resetting the variable and linking the sound file in the library). Lucky, I had Russell Chun's ""Flash Advanced VQG"" (ISBN 0201726246) book to help me figure it out. Also some of the naming codes that are written in this chapter are wrong.However, I still say it's a good book... just keep working it!"
1,Not the best book that I've read on Actionscript...,"If you are serious about learning the basic principles of Actionscript, I recommend skipping this particular title - (sorry...)This was the first Actionscript book that I had ever purchased, and I found myself purchasing another Actionscript shortly thereafter. Don't get me wrong, for the few days I was learning things, but as soon as the actual coding begins, alot of the syntax explanation was simply not there leaving me with more questions than answers. Even the live example site documented in the book was kinda weak. I like the ""Friends of Ed"" titles but you can tell that this was an early work.The most important keys were missing, syntax and way that the Actionscript interpretor in the Flash Player works - pretty important subjects. Luckily, I found a more ""definitive guide"" (hint to the title) by Colin Moock that covered the language pretty fully and left me with more answers than questions!"
5,Excellent introduction,"I loved the book, read it like a good novell from cover to cover. It's dogeared all over now, post-its stickin' out every ten pages or so, and I feel I'm ready to get something coool online soon! Sure, you don't get all the details (that what I bought Moocks reference book for anyway...), but the title says ""Foundation"", so that's ok; some nice examples to build upon and all the code online to download (why not on a cd though?), so what more could you want?"
2,Disappointment,"If you want to see this film because you loved ""Being John Malkovich"" you will almost certainly be disappointed. The two films are not of the same quality, they are not even in the same range of quality.I think Charlie Kaufman is one of the most important writers writing screenplays today, and everything I've read of his (from ""Being John Malkovich"" to ""Adaptation"") had been superb, but ""Human Nature"" simply did not translate well from page to screen.And I can't say that it is necessarily all Michael Gondry's fault in his direction. While, I think part of the problem is that Gondry didn't ""get"" the screenplay, part of the problem is that this was Kaufman's first script and while entertaining on the page, when put on screen, without the humorous writing style and Kaufman's cynical voice ... well, the filmable elements simply don't hold together.Wait for ""Adaptation"" or ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,"" both of which promise to be better. They could hardly be worse."
4,"Funny, weird satire","This movie was weird... no way around that. You have a neurotic doctor, who is obsessed with table etiquette (his newest experiment is teaching mice table manners), a hairy woman, her electolysist, an ape man, and a fake French girl... what an ensemble!Lyla was my favorite character in the movie... it was just too funny to see her shaving her whole body in the bathroom. I was sad when she decided to change for the crazy doctor! I thought Puff was hilarious--he did a great job playing the ape man! The whole story line was laugh-out-loud funny, but from the very beginning you could sense the message about the ridiculousness of human nature.This movie was making a statement, through all of the weird antics of the characters."
4,djlibra?? Spell check?,"Question the first review based on how poorly it is written. This seems like a poor person in which to take advise. I asked myself why more original movies like this are not released, and that person is the answer. Comparing it to ""Kung Pow""? If you didn't know that movie was going to be stupid before watching it, then stop considering yourself a good source for reviews.The movie is quirky and original. If you like that--you will like this."
3,Entertaining,"This was an entertaing film, with some interesting themes. Definitely original, and quirky. I liked it. not as good as Being John..don't know about Adaptation yet."
1,Complete garbage...,"This movie is unbelievably awful. Avoid at all costs.Even Herzog's similarly-themed Kasper Houser is better than this, and that's not saying much. At all.And to make matters worse, why in the heck did they have to pretend it took place in New York, when it was clearly downtown L.A. (aka, the 9th Cricle of Hell... on Earth)."
1,Karens books are not funny !,"Training men like ""dogs"" or ""boys""? I tell you,this womans anti-male rantings are getting really old.You wont find real humor,information or inspiration in Ms.Salmansohns books,only childish disdain for men which permeates every single page.If you want real self-help or humor look elsewhere."
4,go for the Zeyl translation,"Amazon seems to have linked together all the comments on the Timaeus (no matter the translator). It is very possible that you are reading this under a different translation, not the Jowett translation as the commenter suggests. In any case, I recommend the Donald Zeyl translation. It DOES have Stephanus numbering -- very appropriate for class discussions and scholarly work. In my opinion, it is the best English translation available -- and I've spent years working through the text in Greek. Another translation that is nice to have around for alternative readings of key passages (all translation involves interpretation) is Peter Kalkavage's."
1,Not a discussion copy.,"This copy doesn't include the Stephanus numbers required for a decent in-depth discussion. Although Jowett has a great reputation for being good at literal translation, the lack of numbers makes this copy undesirable if one is going to discuss the book as part of a class or reading group."
4,Great music,"This is a great CD from one of the premier groups of Hawaiian music. This CD contains a mix of great traditional, classical and contemporary hits from the Islands. The music here captures the essence and feelings of Hawaii nei."
1,very disappointed,i read the reviews before purchasing this cd but did not listen to any samples. the reviews for this cd were so good and i had previously bought 2 cd's by israel kamakawiwo that are great - i thought i couldn't go wrong with this one. WRONG. this cd in my opinion is horrible. can't even listen to it.
4,A Good Introduction To An Important Doctrine.,"J. Vernon McGee once commented that, after a sermon on prophesy, commented to a deacon that a lot of people would have not liked that sermon. The deacon responded that his sermon was nothing -- the subject that would make the audience mad was grace.This book is great at introducing the subject, and helping a person get a handle on the subject. The authors for the most part succeeded in being able to be understood.I found the project on Sola Scriptura to be better done than this one. I found the appendix (""Rome NOT Home"") to be unnecessary and even more rambling than the other articles. Also, this book promoted Calvinism more so than the ""Sola Scriptura"" volume, implying that unless you are a 5 point Calvinist you have a wrong understanding of salvation by faith alone. Wrong. I do not consider myself Calvinist (or Arminian for that matter), and I feel I understand the subject properly."
5,Great stuff!,"Holt is great. Some of his newer works aren't as solid IMO. But this one, Who's Afraid of Beowulf? and Flying Dutch are a must read!"
3,its alright,"i read this as an assignment in my fantasy literature class. it wasnt bad, but i wasnt super impressed either."
2,Expecting Something Funnier,"Honestly, with all the reviews saying how funny this book is, etc, it was really very boring, and only had maybe two parts that were even remotely funny. It's actually kind of depressing and cynical."
4,Great,This book reminds us to set aside our own egos when managing a business or a department. It is a quick read with a clear message. I would recommend that all senior managers and those who aspire to be a senior manager read this book.
5,excellent new wave mix,"It was an excellent product. A great blend of 80's new wave, delivered in good condition, on time."
2,Monster 80's Volume 2,"I was going to order this, having ordered Volume 1 of the same title, when I noticed that this has a track on it that is ALSO on Volume 1, ""Goody Two Shoes"" by Adam Ant. Why in the world would anyone publish a 2nd Volume of a CD set and include a duplicate track on it??? RIP OFF."
4,Good low-budget laughs!,Hilarious blend of bad acting and funny characters. Favorite scenes were the onces that featured the Uncle. Worth it if you're not too picky about script quality and can laugh on the stupid little things that happen in movies.
1,"I am sorry, but What a rip off!","I was expecting a book to arrive. What I got was the same size as ""The Little Engine that Could"". I later found all these examples and much much much much more in The Artists Handbook by Ray Smith -which is excellant."
5,Reese's is the BEST!,"Our family LOVES coffee tapioca...it's a real treat, and make it often. Could never find it in the stores, so was thrilled to find it here. Thank you Amazon!! Have been using a brand from an Asian store, and it isn't the same. It breaks up, and is more of a thickener. Reese's is perfect for coffee tapioca pudding."
5,Tapioca Pearls Excellent Vendor A+,I will use this vendor again for this product. A+ Very good service. I used them last year and I will use them next year.
2,not large,"This Reese large pearl tapioca is the same size as my small pearl tapioca. Silly me, I thought it would be like the stuff I grew up liking. I was so looking forward to whipping up some large pearl tapioca pudding. I am very disappointed."
4,Lovely.,"I extremely liked the Sabrina series book, ""While the Cat's Away"". The plot was very nice, and I always like to read how Salem is as a person. Actually, when recieving this book, I was sure it was the counterpart to the Sabrina TV show episode where Salem gets into Gordy's body, so I thought it'd be a bit dull, but this was a whole new adventure, as Salem got his own body (and was descripted quite nicely) and was unknown at Westbridge High. I recommend any Sabrina fan to read this book, as well as the others."
4,Wide ranging office wisdom,"This is something new. Here is a book that straddles the reasonable middle rather than the Ghengiz Khan and the PC extremes.If we all follow Jean's advise on office conduct the only problem we would have is that we would not be able to think of any horror stories to tell our coworkers during happy hour.I only rate the book four stars, since it has made me slightly paranoid, taking into account that the book has now been read by most of the people in my office."
5,RULES FOR BEHAVIOUR,"Two things have occurred in our business and social behaviour:1. Organisations recognise true alignment in the interests of both employees and employers.2. There is less social distinction between staff and those who direct their efforts.The result of such upheaval is that the old rules of management and behaviour no longer give clear direction.Jean Kelley's book revisits these rules. Her fundamental conclusions are:- That there is no substitute for honesty.- Directness and frankness provide a framework for dealing with most situations.Case studies often remain the best way of illustrating a point and Ms Kelley has been able to do so with relevance, clarity and context.Ms Kelly postulates that there will always remain a paradox that sophisticated and open societies benefit from having rules and guidelines by which we may live.Geoff Hardy, Managing Director, Bassett Consulting Engineers, Australia"
3,Don't go postal! Read this book!,"All of the office politics, dishonesty and clawing that was going on around me was stressing me out. I was about to join in reluctantly for fear of being left in the dust. This book was a real eye opener and has helped me deal with what I have learned to be a universal corporate problem (which explains a lot about why corporate America is continuously critisized). If everyone is clawing their way to the top, who is actually working and getting the job done? Thanks to this book's funny approach to dealing with office politics, I am and I hope it will not go un-noticed."
4,Carlander Vol1 Fishery Handbook,Information in Volume 1 is dated and includes references up to 1967. Very good book for basic information about lampreys through trout-perch.
3,A must for collectors,"This disc is a must for Costello collectors. It contains a live Attractions version of Basement Kiss not available on any reissue. It also contains a subtle remix of Complicated Shadows that, I feel, moderately improves on the All This Useless Beauty album version. This is also not available on any reissue."
5,Excellent pedals with GREAT grip!,"These are awesome platform pedals. I bought them to replace the ""nylon"" pedals on my wife's hybrid. The only concern is the relatively ""open"" bearing race on the inside of the pedals. I am concerned that dirt and grit will collect in the bearing race, shortening the life of the pedals significantly. Still, for the price, I guess we'll just replace them again when/if that happens.BTW, be sure you're getting the right size pedals. For some whacked out reason, pedals come in either 1/2"" or 9/16"" sizes (the size of the ""bolt"" that goes into the crank). Why they can't standardize and everyone just use the more standard 9/16"" pedal is one of those mysteries of the universe. I mean really ... 1/16"" difference? I bought the 9/16"" (more common) pedals and had to order these 1/2"" pedals."
1,Waste of my money!,"If you already got the Joy of Sex book, you don't need this. It seems to me the author took the whole part of his original book and reprinted that section. The book is so small it's even hard to keep open. Is ok, if you don't have other books about this subject."
1,low level book,"The cover of this book make you think ""This is the book I need"". But you'll only find a poor draws with nothing new. I made a bad decission, so I hope you don't!"
1,I thought this book was going to more then what it was.,I was not too happy when I recieved this book in the mail. It's only a few pages long and very small type. The author just reiterated things most people already know. The pictures were very tasteful and was far for a porn book. Basicaly the book seemed to be played up more then it should have been. The average person already knows the positions described in this book.
4,"Excellant book, written well and illistrated with taste",I read the book with my wife and we both enjoyed the tasteful illustrations and the verbage that the author used in his discriptions. The book was helpful and held our intrest from the beginning to the end a few times.
1,zzzzzzzzz,"The only thing you will use this book for is trying the sexual positions on it, oh and maybe a paper weight."
5,Magic,"Best product ever! My husband calls it ""the magic"". If you work out, you need this product for your sore muscles! Worth every penny!"
5,The Truth,If you are in pain look no further this stuff is amazing.I bet you will order more.I did and I assure you you'll love it !
2,Keep Looking,This is not a good DVD if you want drills for on the field with a whole team. This is more for 1 on 1 in the back yard with younger kids. KEEP LOOKING if you want a coaching aid for on the field drills............
4,Wish the clips were tighter,"Nothing keeps the curl in my hair longer than Caruso steam rollers. The curl from standard hot rollers lasts about 8 hours, but these keep a wave in my straight hair for days. The only problem is the clips are not snug enough to keep my fine hair from slipping out sometimes."
4,Soft sponge rollers,I love the soft sponge material they used on these rollers. I order these rollers for sponges since i already have many different color rollers. Most of old rollers have these rough porous sponges around them. Now I wish the manufacturer also sells 1. just sponges only 2.plstic rollers with shorter shaft
4,Great Quality - could be cheaper,I love my Caruso curling system but really needed new rollers. These were great quality -I just wish they weren't so expensive and what I really wish is that you could purchase the foam part w/o buying a whole new plastic roller. What a waste to have to throw out the plastic part. Maybe I could figure out a way to make my own foamy thingys. Sigh.
5,Replacement Rollers,Exactly what I needed - and at a reasonable price too. I purchased the Caruso Molecular Steam System about 20 years ago and was very surprised to be able to find replacement rollers. Thank you so much!Donna
2,Caruso steam rollers,These are easy to work with and curl very well but most certainly not for short to medium length hair. Ordering this from Amazon it would have been nice to get a receipt as these did not work out like I had thought they would and it would have been nice to have the option of returning them.
5,Best curlers ever!,"I have had this curler set for about 15 years. The steamer works perfectly. I had worn out the foam part of my old curlers and was thrilled to find them on Amazon! My hair is fine and rather thin. I can get a great curl with these, especially if you twist the hair before you roll it in the curler. My hair doesn't get caught in the curlers either. For the best results, your hair has to be dry and the curler steamed for about three seconds (so it doesn't get wet). I leave them in for about ten minutes. I get perms and these work great in-between perms to make the curl last longer. Also works great on straight hair. They are easy on fine hair, also. I am VERY happy to find replacement curlers! I think they are wonderful!"
4,Great - but ditto on the sponge dilemma...,"I, too, have had the Caruso steam roller system since it rolled around the first time back in the early 90's, and it's been wonderful. Beautiful, soft long-lasting curls every time. I agree however, with the sponge-versus-whole roller problem, but I improvised a bit:I bought a bunch of inexpensive, pink foam rollers and removed the plastic spines from each. Then, I disassembled my Caruso rollers and replaced the original, worn-out foams with these new foams. They worked like a charm, and although they don't last quite as long as the Caruso foams do, they do last quite a while and are cheap enough to replace as often as needed. Just thought I'd share that tip."
1,Not for short hair,"The small and petite Caruso rollers do not come with the necessary hair combs/clips to help curl on the difficult to use sponge curler. The instructions even advise the use of the hair comb/clips to be able to curl short hair more easily, but the company does not provide them. Definitely not a good product for short hair. And the company does not sell the hair combs/clips separately to be able to obtain them in any other way."
5,caruso rollers,my hair looked it's best when i used these curlers. thank goodness you guys had them. i checked other places and they didn't carry any other size but Jumbo.
4,Caruso Steam Jumbo Rollers,"I bought these in addition to what came in the set, thinking that I may need it. In the end I didn't need the extra 6 pack, however will keep it for backup. I found that the large and jumbo size that came in the set are the same size so you end up with 12."
4,Great curlers,I have had Caruso hair curler set for over a decade. I have been very pleased with the product. My hair is hard to curl and it does a wonderful job curling my hair without burning/drying out my hair.Needed to replaced some of the curlers because they were over a decade old and were starting to disintegrate. They did last a long time and I purchased them again.
2,Cool Curlers,"I like the ionic mist curlers, but why can't we buy just the foam part of the curler? The foam wears out quickly and I am left with a perfectly good roller... I think it would be much more practical and less expensive. Guess they have got to squeeze our pocket just a little more."
2,Didn't work like I expected,"This product didn't work the way I expected. I use to have one years ago that required salt and it worked great. I also didn't like the rollers, they didn't stay in my hair, every few seconds one was falling out. In general I liked the curl, but it was too much trouble dealing with the modelcular steam unit."
4,caruso rollers,"These rollers are a God send to dry limp, fine hair. Used with the caruso steamer it gives my hair body it has never had, and it lasts."
2,Caruso rollers,I was dissappointed that I received 2 different types of foam on the rollers-- 6 were soft foam and 12 were rough foam. I would think the entire order would be of the same consistency.
5,Rollers,"I love these rollers and this system, my hair is fine and thick, these rollers curl my hair and the curl stays all day!"
4,music is great but the cut is not,"I've really, really liked the music. But reading the fine print is important: the mix is done as one track, and only a very short piece from every song is included. The total length is only half of what a normal CD would be, 33 minutes. If I've read that before, I'd buy another CD with full songs."
1,False Advertising,"Not for beginners!!! This DVD offers nothing of what was outlined on the cover. Ms. Nolan clearly has Never had any type of back pain, and has NO idea how to teach at a beginners level. Furthermore, I had no success finding a way to communicate directly with her web site as I want to send the DVD back!"
3,too many sun salutations and too peppy voice,"I would have liked the dvd better if there had been less repetiton of sun salutations and there would have been more back opening work/back bends. Plus her voice is like a cheerleader on meth. It really is not that bad, but compared to the soothing voices of other yoga teachers, her voice can get distracting. It said in her background that she had had many years of dance training, and so I thought maybe she would be like Rodney Yee; she is not. If you want a dvd that will open your back and hips with an excellent teacher, I would recommend Yoga for Stress Relief with Barbara Benagh. That dvd has a variety of routines and the instructor is very knowledgeable. It is excellent. This dvd is not a bad dvd, but if Nolan had added some more posses, turned down her voice, and did some more back work, I would have liked the dvd more."
3,Not bubblegum-,"These are ""sweet-tarts"" hard candy, not bubble gum as stated in the description. Fun item nonetheless. My husband, who collects skull items, enjoyed finding these in his Christmas stocking!"
4,For my desk at work,"I keep this caddy on my desk at work... at my job in NYC. I sometimes find hate messages stuck to it or plastic bags covering it, but that's to be expected when I'm surrounded by yankee fans. I took off one star just because I wish that the notes in the middle were sticky notes or even sheets of paper with the Boston logo, but they're just plain white sheets."
4,Average Box Set,"This was so-so since this 4 CD collection had it's moments and down points! I enjoyed the ""Singles Collection: 1969-1993"" 2 CD set much better."
3,not worth it,"i purchased the box set for 40.00 brand new. only to get the long version of cat people (puttin out fire) original movie soundtrack. the songs have been mixed and sound like the 20 bit masters, instead of the 24-bit masters. the best of david bowie sounds better than the box set of cat people. to bad it was edited on the best of."
2,Another boring reissue...zzzzzzzzz!,"OK, I'll admit I haven't purchased or listened to this particular collection. But, having the original issue fron several years ago, I can tell you the ""new"" version is far inferior! Basically, the reissue gives us 24 tracks not on the original. And they're not really stellar compositions, IMHO. Big deal. Plus, the original included a fourth disk (3 live performances and a music video). Why couldn't they have included this on the reissue? Maybe someone needs to ask the fans what they would like to see, for a refreshing change. Gee, what a concept!"
1,Never let me down,"Well, I love David Bowie and I own most of his releases, but this box set has disappointed me. As other customes have said, ""Sound and Vision"" isn't neither a gratest hits nor a rarities collection. Where are classic songs as ""Life on mars"", ""Starman"", ""Jean genie"", ""Fame"", ""Under pressure"", ""Let's dance"", ""Absolute beginners"" or ""This is not America""? There are few rarities really interesting, for example ""Dodo"" or ""It's hard to be a saint in the city"". EMI / Virgin could do better."
5,68-89 sound and vision thin box set - perfect !,all the great versions of all his great classics..just to name a few ..space oddity demo ?...wild eyed boy from freecloud. b-versionbewlay brothers...station to station live...sound and vision....wild is the wind ..tcv15....all great original songswith a great box set and book included...recommended..
3,A good album but don't start here.,"The newest CD from Germany's best-ever band is good, and does have some of their best stuff, but if you're not yet fimilar with Der Onkelz they do have better albums. These would be good places to start: ""Evil People Evil Music"" (1985), ""Bar Terrorists"" (88),""Holy Songs"" (92), ""Here Are the Onkelz"" (95), ""Viva Los Tioz"" (98- availible via Amazon!) and, especially ""EINS"" (96).But, like I said ""Dopamin"" is good. It combines a progressive Metallica sound with a power punk approach of later Ramones.(8/5/04- Since that writing the Onkelz have just released a new album: ""Adios"". Judging from the title this is to be there swansong. ""Adios"" deserves FIVE stars! If this is their final CD they've gone out with a winner! God bless the Onkelz!)"
2,I just don't like it.,"Really, there's nothing wrong with the case itself. I just don't like it.I don't like the fact that I'm trusting my $300 mixer to a nylon strap and a plastic buckle. I don't like that the foam they provide to pad the lid (and keep the mixer in place during transport) screws up my channel settings. I don't like that I have to remove the mixer from the case in order to use it. I don't like that the glue holding the velcro from the cleats has already given out.It good for what it is... I was honestly expecting this to be a rackmount unit (purchased it elsewhere), and was led to believe that the strap and buckle enclosure was ""added security"" to latches on the case."
4,Good Book though not without errors,"Great reference not sure about it serving as a good text book as the section on Modulation, for instance, is not very detailed and not all that well put together. For instance, equations 4.7 does not follow from figure 4.5 if you use a repeating input sequence of +1, -1, +1 , -1, etc. Also equation 4.5 is itself as defined an average, not an absolute value."
1,Worst Pitching Video I Have Even Seen,"I have purchased somewhere between 10 to 15 different baseball video's and this one is really not worth the time or the money.I guess if you knew nothing about pitching this video would give you some drills to work on, but you can get the same information for free on You Tube.The kids they utilize for their drills have really bad form, which is not helpful to watch. My 10 year old came in and started watching the video with me and asked if it was a joke.There are some good video's out there, but this one is not it."
1,Put me to sleep.,"This was the most boring baseball instructional video i ever seen......the drill'S that they use,makes no sense to me at all,pitcher pitching with one foot on a chair,pitching with his feet crossed,etc.ARE YOU KIDDING ME.if you want to see how baseball should be played and instructed,watch the Tom Emanski video's or Cal and Billy Ripken video's these are the best video's i've seen.Believe me,i'm not Tommy Lasorda by all means,but dam i know some stuff about baseball,this video sucks,buy something else,this video put me to sleep.HONESTLY."
4,Excellent Transaction.,Very interesting video. Has a lot of useful information and is easy to understand. Very good for younger players and coaches.
5,Best Baseball Video I Have Seen!,"I have purchased somewhere between 10 to 15 different baseball video's and this one is well worth the money.There is information in this program I have not seen anywhere else, including YouTube.The kids utilized for the drills have really good form. My 12 year old came in and started watching the video with me and loved it!There are some great video's out there, this is one of them!This DVD is part of this best selling baseball set by Marty Schupak.Baseball Coaching:Schupak's Baseball Super 8 DVD Set"

2,TV: The Movie,"Typical immature movie. Not very entertaining. Expected more from National Lampoon, they used to be very funny!"
1,Cesspool of funny,"This is one of those kind of films that been done better by others.This film wallows in humilation and excrement. If you like this sort of stuff, there's probably some form of therapy you can receive short of a lobotomy."
1,"Garbage, don't waste your money.","I love Jackass, Wildboyz etc. but this was god awful. I rented the movie & wished I could've gotten my money back. DON'T BUY IT."
1,sheer garbage,"I enjoyed the jackass movies and some of national lampoons other films so i figured this ought to be good. I was wrong. There was a lot of potential there, parodies of ""Fear Factor"" and ""Miami Vice"". The entire thing was painfully unfunny, lots of drug use and pointless violence and homosexuality. The MTV Cribs parody PADS merely showed steve-O's ""house"" littered with booze and drugs and he stumbled about half-nude and cursing. I wouldnt wish this movie on my enemies. Please don't buy, watch or be near this movie at any time."
4,"Funny movie, If you liked national lampoons lost realities, then you'll like this.","I was suprised to see this coming out today, I had seen a preview for it, but forgot about it until I saw it in the ads sunday. It contains much of the cast of Jackass (steve-o, wee-man, and others), and some other familiar faces of comedy actors. This movie is made up of skits that are parodies of current TV shows...national lampoon's style. Overall funny, about 90 minutes of no brain laughing humor. No acadamy award here, but it does make for a fun time anyway. Check it out, especially if you like the National Lampoon's lost reality DVD's 1 and 2."
4,Some funny stuff up in this movie,"classic tripped out stoner movie, with no point, but who needs a point, we just need funny stuff, the movie occassionally goes over board with cheezey scenes, but all and all this is a must have for all you stoners. this movie is like a combination of Jackass and reno 911."
2,TV The Movie,"I saw this sitting on a shelf and I had just watched Jackass 3 and figured, what the hell, it could be good for a laugh. It has most of the cast of Jackass minus arguably the two biggest stars-Bam and Johnny. The dvd came with a cool looking tv guide based on the movie as an insert and the menu to the movie was like the tv guide channel. I'd give them 5 stars for those two things alone. Sadly, the movie has a few funny scenes but alot of it is unfunny. If you're a big Jackass fan then you might enjoy it but if your a casual fan who likes Jackass on occassion, then this movie is not for you."
1,not funny and actually kind of sad,Being a HUGE Jackass fan when I saw this at the video store I snatched it up and settled in for some hilarity. What I got was a confusing mish mash of unfunny sketches and a truly disturbing view of Steve-O spiraling towards rock bottom in his apartment (really proud of O for getting the help he needed since then) Over all wouldn't recommend. The only remotely entertaining bit is Pontius as Jesus. Definately don't buy and only rent if you are morbidly curious about how bad this movie truly is.
3,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this book. With a plain, straightforward title, I had hoped the writing style would be the same. But it seems the author's goal was to shed light on Tibetan sources that dealt with karma, rather than to shed light on karma itself.I often felt he was explaining about mandalas that symbolize karma, rather than explaining karma.Karma is a complex topic. I don't feel I understand it any better after having wrestled with this book."
5,Needs a US DVD release.,"To the reviewer who wrote ""it's worth watching just to see Shelley Hack get hit with a telephone"".... LOL!This is an underappreciated and underseen horror gem from 1987. Low on budget, high on tension. A shrewd piece of acting by Terry O'Quinn. Director Joseph Ruben has made several good and a few great films, and this one ranks as his best, IMHO.Can't believe with all the hoopla surrounding the TV show ""Lost"" that this film with a ""Lost"" star in it hasn't been rushed out on DVD. Legal/rights/ownership obstacles, perhaps? Well for goodness sakes smooth those obstacles out and deliver us this DVD. My VHS copy won't look good too much longer."
3,"""Home sweet home...""",The marvellous performance by Terry O'Quinn as the character of the title is the best thing about this film. He keeps moving from place to place marrying women with a child or children and trying to set up the perfect family like in Leave It To Beaver/Father Knows Best type cornball TV shows. When they don't live up to his expectations he explodes into a homicidal rage. Even though he is a murderer I found myself feeling sympathy for the Stepfather because Jill Schoelen's character is so bitchy and self centred she didn't really give him a chance to succeed in his dream.
4,The Stepfather,"This is a thriller about a man who is obsessed with getting a perfect all-American family. He marries into families with no father and then one day just blows up to kill them. There are no monsters here, no aliens, no make believe stuff at all...just a reality-based psychopath which is what makes this movie great. But a lot of scenes could have been better and they could have made it a lot scarier."
1,Ignorance avails,"Okay, this movie was totally predictable and lame. But that's not the worst part. The so-called ""doctor"" whom the teenage daughter is seeing makes a joke about billing his schizophrenic patient twice, implying that people with schizophrenia have two personalitys. No real psychologist would ever think or say that. That is an urban myth that is wide-spread among people who don't know much about psychology but doctors have always known the difference between schizophrenia and multiple personality disorder. I was annoyed by that joke because I have schizoaffective disorder and know A LOT about mental illnesses."
3,Cool Cd,"It's a pretty cool cd.But every song seems to be about the same pain which gets monotonous. Also all their songs have a certain familiarity to them, whether with their other songs or someone elses songs. Nevertheless it's a decent album. I got it for like 7 bucks so it was worth the money."
3,solid album.,"I initially purchased Superkala due to the song ""Caught in the Sun"", which is beautiful. I wasn't expecting much more out of the album since they appeared to be another run-of-the-mill rock outfit with a ballad that went gold. It's actually a fine rock album. There is nothing ground-breaking with it, but it does stand apart from most of the new age rock groups releasing music, and it's kind of sad this group only got a small window of opportunity to ""get big"". Maybe they'll release another album and get a chance to be put back on the map, but if not we still have this pretty strong rock album. Turn off your mind, don't expect technical wizardry and complex compositions, and this album will probably be a winner for you."
4,Good listening,"Catchy melodies, memorable lyrics. These things add up to a solid ""debut"" from Course of Nature. The band's earned its chops traveling the college and bar circuit to much acclaim that's destined to extend outside its Southern roots now that CON has backing from a major label."
4,Good cd,"This band is pretty cool. I heard of them when they played the single ""Caught In The Sun"" on my local radio station. I instantly thought the song was a strong song and maybe there would be more strong songs on the album. But the best songs on this are ""Wall of Shame"", ""Caught In The Sun"", ""Someone Else To You"" and ""1000 Times"". Maybe this band is the underdog band for right now but they write good songs and that's all that matters."
5,Course Of Nature: A Breath-Taking Nu-Rock band,"Course of Nature is a trio from Alabama who made the radio waves in late 2002 and early 2003 with their hit song 'Caught In The Sun'. This album is titled 'Superkala', and it is a showcase of the band's talent. This is not one of those run of the mill rock bands....that come and go, fade in and fade out. I thoroughly enjoyed this album with 9 great rock-to songs. The last song was more of a jazzy by-product probably used as an album filler. The sound of the band wasn't too lite or harsh, just right. This band is perfect for background play at a party. The songs that I liked on this album release were 'Better Part Of Me', 'Remain' and 'Caught In The Sun'."
3,"Superkala, cool. but not super","I first heard this first track on this CD back in 2002 in the Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2 soundtrack. I never could find this album. Six years later, I finaly bought it. I thought the whole cd was like the first song ""Wall of Shame"". But i was wrong ""Wall of Shame was heavy and epic, then most of the songs were soft and not so powerful. But its a good album, not great but a good. Doing songs in a soft manor is cool, if you're into that."

3,Does the job,"Does the job. This does what it says on the label, and like others in the series is a good primer."
3,Good Tool for Learning Salesforce On the Job,"This book was actually TOO MUCH of a good thing. I didn't need the Administrative side of things, but for what I did need it was all there.Well thought out useful book."
4,Salesforce for Dummies,Very helpful. Salesforce has lots of online help but I'm working alone and had a lot of ground to cover. This book really helped me get going. I'm still learning and still developing my own system. Don't know how I would have done it without the book.
3,Didn't read it -- changed jobs,"I thumbed through the book which arrived the day before I got a job offer to go to a company installing Microsoft Dynamics . . . looked like it would be useful for someone no, limited, or an old fashioned CRM background."
2,Wouldn't recommend the Kindle Edition,"If you're considering this title in the Kindle edition - think twice. There are numerous screenshots which are simply too small to read. Text can be enlarged on the Kindle, but images cannot. Stick with the paper edition."
5,Much better than previous version!,"Tom comes back strong after his last edition - this one is much more comprehensive than the last - if you are a new or relatively inexperienced user this will be a huge help - and if you are a new system admin this should be your SFDC Bible for a while. Highly, highly recommended..."
3,Salesforce for Dummies,Good overview but lacking in detailed usage instructions. Need to have step by step walk throughs because the online help feature is very confusing. Also needs to reference more clearly what version of Salesforce and modules are needed for certain scenarios.
3,A Review Of The Reviews,I couldn't help noticing that there are 3 Five Star raving reviews of this book posted on the same day from Feb 6 2005 (Strange considering there are only 6 in total). I'm sorry but that is too coincidental making them suspect and of no use to someone like me who just wants an honest opinion from an objective reader.
3,SO SO,THE DRAMA IS TOO LONG AND THE STORY LINE IS CONFUSING AT TIME. the series from HKFlix and Dvdasian have good english subtitles.
1,ELVIS IS ALIVE,if Elvis is alive this video would make him want to take a bullet to the head. the best part of the movie was the words THE END!! this is the worse movie i have ever bought. there's a reason the used copies are sold so cheap!!
3,Smokey's Review,Over all this book is a pretty good read....until the last couple of chapters. Then the author uses this book as a springboard for his theory and opinions on world population written about in his previous books. The first seven chapters more than make up for this shortfall though and I found his ideas very intriguing.I just wish he had concerned himself with the content of the title and left his ideas of the future in his other books. Buy or read this this book and you won't be disappointed...whether you agree with his views or not.
5,"More than earth science, it is literary science","What I enjoyed most about this enormously informative and eye-opening book, was the author's accessible, absorbing, and almost poetic style of writing; it transformed what potentially would be a terribly dry, recondite subject into a revelatory experience. I recommend it for anyone who suffered through Earth Science and Geology textbooks in high school and college."
1,Good while they lasted,"I owned these boots for about a year. I didn't wear them daily. Just on hunting weekends or cold/rainy work days. The 2 rubber soles on the bottom completely separated when I was walking the other day. I have boots that I wear A LOT more than these that I have had for years. I tried to contact Georgia (aka Rocky) boots and never received an email back from them. After 2 weeks of not hearing back I called Georgia boots to tell them about my recent problems, they will not repair any boots they sale and would not replace them because it was less than a month outside of the 1 year warranty. I will never buy another pair of Rocky or Georgia boots again. STAY AWAY. Poorly made product and HORRIBLE customer service."
1,works good then dies,"This DVD worked great when it was new. The line resolution and progressive scan worked great. The color was clear and audio was sharp. CD wkd ok too. I paid extra for progressive scan at the time for the sharper picture. Now 13 months, one month after the warranty expired the DVD mechanism stops reading DVDs. According to Samsung, there are two lasers one for the CD and one for the DVD. I probably used this player 20 times in 13 months and the DVD laser died. Samsung suggested I clean it. I did. No luck. Now I'm having to go buy a new DVD player. Stay away from Samsung. I usually get at least several years of product use with electronics. I used to sell electronics. Spend the $ on a better product, or be happy with one year of good use."
1,Maybe a bad apple,"I'm about to head back to the store with my unit, and I thought I'd see if anyone else had the trouble I had. Well, I'm glad that you all had such good luck with your units. Ours was awful! Perhaps it was a bad apple.There was essentially only one problem with our unit, which is that it freezes while playing DVD's. I can't tell if it is due to scratches, because after ejecting the DVD and playing the same portion again, it sometimes works fine. At any rate, it won't play any movies without freezing, choking, skipping and generally making us miserable.I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and was HIGHLY EMBARASSED when it refused to play properly with DVD after DVD after DVD! When I saw all the good reviews, I felt like I should add my two cents.Make sure you keep the receipt."
2,Worked Fine for Awhile,"For one month, I had no problems with this product. Lightweight, nice looking. Then, it stopped recognizing discs. Whenever I tried to play a movie it read 'no disc'. One month of use is not worth 79 bucks."
1,Bummer,"Plugged it in and simply would not work with component setup. Grainypicture, sometimes just wavy lines. OK on S-Video. Took it back for a Toshiba, which works just fine. This is too bad since the player came with a very good manual, a nice remote and a great set of features."
1,Very disappointing,"This DVD player is a waste of money. It wouldn't play any of my DVDs, brand new or used.Don't ever think about buying this product. Instead, stick to a Japanese brand. This Korean company hasn't gotten its act together yet."
1,I WOULD NEVER BUY ANOTHER SAMSUNG PRODUCT,"I BOUGHT THIS DVD PLAYER 3 MONTHS AGO AND ITS NO LONGER READING ANY DVDS. I CLEANED IT PLENTY OF TIMES AND THAT STILL DIDN'T WORK. I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BUY A LASER CLEANER BECAUSE IT'S ONLY 3 MONTHS OLD. FOR ANYONE THAT READS THIS I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT, OR EVEN THIS COMPANY."
1,Shipped wrong item - does not acknowledge emails,"what else can can I say.Ordered a Samsung P-231 DVD, got a P-230 DVD, a different model.Seller ignores my emails.Buyer beware"
2,Disappointing,"Bought this for the wealth of formats that it supports. It looked like a great deal. As I found out, you get what you pay for. My acid test is several scenes from Gladiator. This player failed. There is lots of screen flickering/flashing on scenes that have a high luminence level. Many of the lower end players have this same issue. Be careful."
1,sucks,"concked out after a couple years. i didnt use it much at all. will play CDs and MP3s but no DVDs anymore. Customer service says i can mail it to jersey at my cost and pay $80 to fix, must put a check in the box when i send it. there are reviews on C/net where others had their players break after a few months too. Im done with Samsung products."
1,"2 died, first under warranty, second 1 month out of warranty","I bought this unit from Sears in 2003 and at first it worked great. A few months of occasional use later it refused to play DVD's, but would still play CDs. Sears replaced the unit since it was under warranty and I was happy again. Now it's a year and 1 month later almost to the day and this one has now died, exact same symptoms.I'm pretty easy to please but this just pisses me off. Save yourself some trouble (and $100) and stay away from this player. My other unit is a Zenith dual deck ($125) and it has performed flawlessly during the same time frame."
2,Cheap DVD player,"well I wanted an inexpensive DVD player assuming the quality of picture and sound on all modern DVD players would be good, but I was wrong, neither the picture nor the sound on this DVD player is acceptable. Probably the best comparison is that the DVD looks and sounds like a not so good VHS tape. Honestly, at this point, I'm kind of unhappy with the unit."
2,Stopped working,"We've had this player for 9 months and it just stopped working. Put a DVD in and its says the disk cant be played, check the disk. But it plays CDs ok. We've cleaned it, turned it off and unplugged it overnight; still doesnt work. Its dead in the water. Where is that darn receipt?"
4,Mine works fine...,"I got mine December of 2002~and it works fine. It's always worked fine. I'm sad to head a bunch of people had trouble with theirs...I use it three or four times a month, and it's never given me trouble..."
1,"Even after almost no use, it is now broken","I bought this unit for my mother-in-law, and I think she used it twice in the last three years. Now it's dead. I won't buy Samsung again."
2,"don't go looking for the yeti, stupid","This seemed like a PG-type horror movie, and it starred John Schneider, so I bought this to watch with my elderly parents. We spent the majority of the film commenting on the typical horror film stupidity of the various characters--i.e., inability to run away from the monster without falling over, thereby making themselves easy prey;the monster is hiding just out of sight of the hero; someone gets the stupid idea to take the only means of transport for the group and the only (halfway)gun and go looking for the beast while everyone else is asleep, then LEAVES the gun in the truck (and gets killed, duh); the hero tries to get help but puts the remaining survivors in a worse situation than before...and on it goes.If you love bigfoot movies, by all means, go ahead and watch this film.The yeti-creature doesn't look half-bad, even if I didn't find it particularly scary, and the scenery is beautiful."
2,Do snowboarders taste like chicken?,"Yep it is another formula ""stay in the car"" movie. Everyone sees the creature and does not believe what they see until they get dispatched; then they do not care. Most of the victoms are too clumsy to get away and become creature chow. I am surprised they did not try to make a pet out of it like a stray cat or maybe give it religion so it will change its carnivorous ways.The underlying themes are how people behave under pressure. A girl thinks her father is not listening. The father thinks the girl has a rotten attitude. The female scientist thinks everyone is a pansy and armed with a camera will force the beast to say cheese. The third wheel male scientist spouts wisdom and then falls prey to altruistic machoism.Will they ever learn their lessons or will the beast get fat and die from clogged arteries?"
5,Good Mvoie,"me and my friend watch this its a good movie we enjoyed it, i enjoyedits good story and good casting d defiantly try watch this movie its very cool andenjoy to watch"
5,Pretty good remake,"I wasn't quite sure what to make of this when I saw it. However, I was pleasantly surprised. While it kept some of the elements of the original movie, it wasn't a complete remake. They took it in a few different directions and made it something different enough to be enjoyable. It was a very good campy movie and well worth watching."
2,Revolting Special Effects,"This could have been a good movie. Unfortunately, it exemplifies in my mind the trend toward the disgusting in contemporary American films. There is genuine chemistry between the two main characters, but the reliance on gross special effects undermines the movie"
2,A terrible remake!,"The original was OK, but this was a disaster! Jeff Goldblum, as usual, plays a very boring scientist who invents a matter transformation device that gets his DNA mixed up with a fly's, that's pretty much all there is to it, nothing else happens except his girlfriend decides she wants an abortion. The SFX were fake and unbeliveable and unlike other people I never felt sick to my stomach once in this movie except twards the acting. See the original, this one is not worth supporting."
1,Double check next time!!!!!!,"Living in Australia and a bit naive when it comes to DVD regions I was under the understanding that Blue Ray discs were compatable all over the world . This was not the case with this disc. It is my fault and not the fault of amazon. I have bought a number of movies via Amazon have found amazon to absolutely great. Effeicent, speedy and they have been able to get me some movies I didn't know were available on DVD.Will be buying more soon. Just need to save up some money."
4,Blu-ray makes disgusting look really good,"This horror classic is improved with the Blu-ray upgrade, and at the low price available at this writing, is even worth the cost of upgrading from DVD. Best watched a while after eating."
4,Looks GREAT on blu-ray!!,"I hadn't seen this movie pretty much since it first came out. A minor classic. For me, the blu-ray transfer was first class. The film looked crisp and sharp and I could see fine details in it so I was perfectly happy with it. I didn't own it on DVD before so it was a no-brainer to buy it on Blu-ray, especially for under $10. If you don't own it on DVD, get the blu-ray. If you already have the DVD, that's a tougher call."
1,The Fly,"The Fly is a disgusting grotesque film but cronenberg is known for this garbage not to mention ruining movies(The Brood,Scanners,the dead zone with the exception of Eastern Promises). Goldblum is good for the role,he is a good actor and geena davis is good in this but the movie as typical are remakes simply doesn't cut it even with disgusting special effects."
4,"Picture a bit soft, effects still pretty amazing","I just watched this on my 42"" Panasonic Plasma and BD35 Player. It was not the sharpest picture, but I'd say a 3.5/5 for PQ and 4/5 for AQ. The storyline, Jeff Goldblum and Gina Davis were great. The creature effects matched Jeff's eccentric personality well, and were a mix of funny, but still rather groundbreaking in the grand scheme of things. I can't say I'd buy this disc (mine came free with an early adopter BD promo in '07), but I definitely recommend you viewing it if you're a fan of the director,or actors, and like this type of flick. It still stands up!"
4,No Flies on this !,"David Cronenberg's voiceover on this disc alone is worth buying it for. He reveals all the secrets in such an entertaining and humble way that the voiceover itself is like a movie. The fly scenes in BR are truly riveting esp. the end where the transformation is complete. Jeff and Geena are perfect together, he so intriguingly geeky and she so girlishly fetching. Their chemistry onscreen is palpable. Great movie, cool SFX for the day, and entertaining game feature to boot. Worth every penny."
5,Great film but.....,"There is nothing that I could possibly add- critique wise about the film itself that hasn't already been written.The same goes for the dvd as well.The film - 5 stars.The extras - 5 stars.So why bother writing something you may wonder?Well my niggle lies with the fact that when I recieved the dvd in the post, there was no black covered slip case as shown in the product image. Oh nevermind, I thought.But then the way the dvd was sealed really narked me BIG TIME.When removing the sticker at the top of the case, the plastic covering was warped and stretched out of place and unmovable glue patches marked the case.So, if you don't mind the presentation of the package - (which incidentally is so much better than the British equivilent), being a little damaged, go ahead and order. Just have a replacement case on hand. Luckily I did."
3,Cronenberg's THE FLY: grotesque at it's best,"David Cronenberg's 8th movie THE FLY, a remake of the 50's sci-fi classic, was his greatest box office achievement. The original script, penned by no other Mel Brooks, had passed Cronenberg's eyes along with Top Gun, Beverly Hills Cop, and Total Recall. Cronenberg decided to take on THE FLY. The transformation of Brundell Fly in the movie is not only grotesque, but extremely believable. And this what Cronenberg does best. He gets you to suspend your disbelief. THE FLY, falling middle ground as far as Cronenberg goes is a little more mainstream than his other attemots. This movie, however will be enjoyed by all horror and sci-fi types, not exclusive to Cronenberg fans."
5,The movie arrived in very good condition and was received promptly. In fact it arrived earlier than I was expecting.,"I had forgotten how graphic this movie was, having seen it when it first came out. But worth watching again and sharing with friends who like graphic and gross images. If you are a Jeff Goldblum and Gina Davis fan, watch it. They all look so young!!! Well, yeah, filmed in the 1980s..."
4,Like a fly on a wall.,"""A man will beg,A man will crawl,On the sheer face of love,Like a fly on a wall.It's no secret at all.""-The Fly, U2There were three men who wanted to prove they each were the best swordsman in the land. The three were gathered in front of a large crowd to showcase their skill. On the first swordsman's turn, he saw a fly, took one swipe, and cut the fly in half. The second swordsman got up, saw another fly, made two swipes, and cut the fly in four quarters. The third swordsman got up, saw another fly, took one swipe, and the fly flew away leaving the third swordsman with a big smile on his face. Everyone said, ""Why are you smiling? The fly is still alive."" The swordsman said, ""Yes, but he'll never be able to have children.""I wish somebody had stopped this fly from having any children, then none of us would have been subjected to this movie's sequel.By the way, The Fly is a good movie."
2,always liked this movie,I forgot about this movie.. so I bought it for a FLY party..... we all STOPPED WATCHED and LAUGHED our butts off! Sometimes watching a movie from your past makes you laugh because our humor has grown so much
1,thefly,never got the dvd you just sent the vhs tape i sent it back reorderd and never got it kids were disappointed
4,Nice and Cheap,"The blu-ray version of the fly definitely looks better than any of the previous releases, and is worth the price (since I think you can usually find this one for under $10). Just as good and gory now as it was when I was a kid."
4,"Terrifying and Sad, yet somehow slightly beautiful","After laughing through Scanners (sorry my love), I wasn't expecting too much from this Cronenberg film. I was pleasantly surprised at how effective everything in this movie was. As much as I dispise Jeff Goldblum, I can't think of anyone better for the part. The visuals were great and I loved seeing the transformation of Seth Brundle (Goldblum) into the ""monster"".For me, this was a completely new experience with horror. I actually felt bad for the ""evil"" in the movie. Normally it's clear cut who the viewer should be rooting for but this movie threw that concept out the window. As wonderful and gross as the transformation was, seeing Seth suffer and become an uncontrolable creature tugged at my heartstrings. Overall, the film is very well done and I enjoyed it thoroughly.As a side note, I'd like to wish everyone a happy, safe, and horror-filled Halloween."
5,the fly,jeff goldblum is melting his cells along with those of a housefly with incredible chris walls make-up magic. and adding the gina davis/john getz love triangle into the mix... david cronenberg has achieved a major movie classic from a vincent price movie classic. stupendous!
5,CREEPY CLASSIC!!!!!,"When i see this movie for the first time, when i was a kid, it really creeps me out...The story is really interesting and disturbing, and the special effects are really good...I've seem this movie more than 10 times, and always disturbs me...BLERGH!!!It's a total thrash creepy movie...if you like the kinds of ALIEN, PREDATOR and vampires you may like it!!!"
5,A Movie For The 80's,"The 1958 remake of The Fly was excellent. This was a movie, not for a first date, but not a bad idea either. It told the story of Seth Brundle, a brilliant scientist who invented a genetic transportation device. One day while he was experimenting, a common housefly got in the machine and our story begins. He falls in love with a writer. When he starts to transform into the fly, the story shows how deep the writer's love was for The Fly. A little gruesome I admit but an overall winner."
2,Don't Buy Unless you Can Solder!!!,"I have had four of these over the past two years--two I received ""bad out of the box"" and the other two consequently failed after a small power surge. I have since repaired all four--all failures were due to poor solder joints! They seem to work OK once they were repaired, but don't buy this unless you are ready to re-solder the connections. I wish I could reach the manufacturer to complain, but have not been able to locate a website or contact for them."
2,specification sheet,"we purchased this from overseas in eu and after 500euros later in customs and shipping only to open it and see that the 2 plugs are not both for 110v! outrageous, we are not able to ship it back! the specifications are for transforming to 110, why would there need to be a 220v.? anyhow, we do not have the capacity to run our washer and dryer now, this is sad, doing laundry by hand is not fun, its exhausting!!!!!!!!!!!! please put more clearly on the specifications that the 2 plugs are one 110 and one 220 for the next relocaty!:("
3,"Not brilliant, but she likes it","Perhaps it's that the rest of us--dad, mom, and fourteen-year-old brother--have had years of playing video games with better complexity and far better graphics, but I'm not wowed by any of the Clickstart games. Yes, I know, they're for young children, but even the web-based games for toddlers have better graphics and are sometimes more user-friendly.That said, my three-year-old does like the Clickstart, and is able to navigate it without help. The Toy Story game isn't all that impressive, for the money, but that's a complaint I have about Clickstart cartridges in general. She enjoys being able to manipulate the familiar characters, and is building some directional skills. Except for the opening sequence with Zurg, however, the characters bring little of the flavor of the movie to the play of the game, and they could easily be any other sprite."
3,not a favorite,"If you own the click start and other games, you might not be impressed with this one. I'm kind of anti-game systems for young kids, but agreed to get this one since the controller was a keyboard. We have the Thomas and the Cars games and love both of them as well as the buit-in games. The Toy Story game, however, doesn't use the keyboard, just the arrows. You control the characters by jumping/running to get items. Granted, you are looking for specific shapes, numbers, colors, or whatever, but it's more like a traditional video game. My husband and I even have trouble controlling the characters."
2,Bad game on an average preschooler's computer.,"First of all let me say the Leapfrog Clickstart is just average at best. We have recently purchased the FIsher Price IXL and my daughter has enjoyed that handheld computer much more than the Clickstart.With that being said, this game is one of the worst on this system. There is really only one challenge on the game...the graphics are poor....the educational value is very minimal....basically save your money.My daughter has the Finding Nemo title for this system and enjoys it much more than Toy Story."
2,Don't Buy This,This Toy Story game is aweful...We have Dora and Thomas and those are a lot better. This one doesn't even compare...

3,Don't trust the negative review,"The nut thinks that the JLU was a bad show, so he clearly has no taste whatsoever."
4,What happened to the last third?,"Old School was very interesting. The movie starts out with a lame beginning.The beginning was unoriginal, thus, making it not funny. The middle section has some good cameos. The last thirty minutes are a huge disappointment. There are no humorous scenes, and I lost my interest from there. Also, the movie doesn't explain a.) what ""Frank the Tank"" does for a living, because he never seems to be at work b.) how Mitch could afford a house across the street from a college c.) why Mitch would buy a house he obviously could not afford to lease. If you liked Road Trip, you will most likely like Old School."
3,Old School...if only....,"I realize that one shouldn't judge movies such as this by the same standards as serious drama, but even by the normal standards of such college-related comedies, ""Old School"" comes up short.Don't get me wrong; it's not horrible--it's just that it's not all that it might have been. For one thing, the ""unrated"" edition barely merits an R rating; for another, Vince and Luke's roles were woefully underwritten.""Say It Isnt' So"" & ""Not Another Teen Movie"" are just two recent titles that far outscore ""Old School"" in the laughs department.Better luck next time, boys. Until then, save your money!"
2,VERY weak: not even worth renting,"Not even comedy man Will Ferrell's appearance or Luke Wilson's charm, save this movie from the same place where movies such as Joe Dirt come from. There are a few moments that are probably bound to becoming classics, but unfortunately, if you saw the trailer, you saw most of the good stuff that the movie has to offer. When I first thought of the concept (a fraternity put together by guys already graduated, married and/or already entrenched in their professional lives) I thought: ""clever idea, must be funny."" How wrong I was! For a comedy it falls short by a lot. The storyline could have gone in a lot of brilliant directions but it didn't. We rented it. It's not even worth renting, even if you get it for free because it's a guaranteed title in Blockbuster and they are out of it."
5,"Movie is hysterical, but the DVD extras [are bad].","This movie is a modern day animal house. It is just that funny. The combination of Vince Vaughn's dryness, and Will Ferrels over the top comdedic posuring is just too much. These guys had everyone laughing like hyenas. I am just praying that they don't make a sequel, becuase sequels always [are bad]. If you haven't seen it, rent it or buy it and you won't be dissapointed.I purchased the DVD for the movie, not for the extras though. The cut scenes were cut for good reason. They are just not funny. There is also a spoof on the actors workshop that the three of them do, and it is pretty boring as well. Don't expect much."
5,Truly one of the greatest comedies of all time.,"This and Animal House are truly the two best movies about college fraternaties of all time. I may even have to say this is slightly better because it gets at something that adult way post college middle aging men all sort of feel deep down : ""Wouldn't it be cool to just toss all responsibilities and go back to college?"" and then proceeds with the logical and probable consequences of three men who actually try doing that in the most comedic fashion possible, I was busting in half laughing through the movie."
5,A Classic!,"The funniest movie I've seen in years. I don't usually like ""frat boy"" humor, but this is the one exception."
4,Good Stuff,I loved this DVD. My only problem with it is that the unrated version and the rated version are two seperate DVDs. You can't have the option of both presented to you on one DVD like you can on a lot of other movies with rated/unrated versions. I would have like to seen that on this one. Everything else was great.
2,Unrated? How about overrated....,"I am NOT a big fan of Will Ferrel, but my friends said that it was hilarious and that I should check it out. This movie was an OK effort. I just thought that it could have been alot better. Some characters were not developed enough in my opinion (i.e. Blue). It was fun, but not all it was hyped up to be. It is not the same caliber of comedy as any National Lampoons film (except for 7 Deadly Sins which stunk) and to compare it to Animal House is sacrilige."
5,Animal House? Get outta here,"Must be 40 yr olds that think animal house is some devine movie, The younger generation such as I(28)know that Old School is waaaaaaayyyyy better! no contest. i've seen both and I personally Think your a dumbass to think animal house even compares to old school, and someone should take your keyboard away and ban you from amazon! Later Losers."
3,Just for fun,It was silly and goofy as expected. I actually laughed a few times. I got this movie because I read that it was funny and it was. Not rolling on the floor tears coming down my face funny but funny enough. I'll never will be a big fan of either Vince Vaughn or Will Ferrell but they did okay this time.
5,"""Hey Merisa It's Frank Ricard""","The Funniest movie of 2003. This slapstick party comedy starring the King of comedy William Ferrel and also starring Lucas Wilson and Vincent Vaughn. The three men who relive their college years when they start a faternity. This film is laugh out loud hilarious. It's the Animal House of the 21st century. it's Ferrel's funniest act since Jay and Silent Bob and Saturday Night Live. The Best scene is Will Ferrel streaking "" come on snoop, snoopaloop bring your green hat"". This film will be a classic comedy some day. If you want screwball,slapstick comedy. or if you saw Anchorman first. You'll love Old School. It's a hell of a good parade of party animals. ""Blue your my boy"""
4,Hysterical!,"This was one of the better comedies to come out earlier this year. I enjoyed it alot! Will Farrell was great in his role. I laughed so hard...The only problem that I had with it was that a few parts seemed to drag a bit. That is my only criticism. If you wanna laugh, go see this one. You won't be disappointed.*Andy Dick has a HILARIOUS cameo!*"
1,Grade School.,"Given the talent involved with this flick it's truly a shame how utterly bland OLD SCHOOL is. A superb cast is wasted on jokes that are unfunny and/or poorly executed. There are a dwarfs handfull of humerous scenes and they do not make up for the banality of the rest of the package. Do yourself a favor and watch ANIMAL HOUSE for the sixty-third time because I guarantee it will produce more laughs than this snoozer. Poor writing and direction drags a comedy dream cast to the Deans office, a damn shame."
3,america's critic,i dunno where to start will what happened this fell short unsatisfing and barely entertaining-- worth 1 time of watching story wasnt good and just seemed blahhh
3,Meh...,"Ever watch a movie the first time and laugh so hard your stomach hurts, then watch it again and think...now what was funny about that? Enter, Old School. and there ya go..."
1,Old school is old just buy the Blur of Insanity,"If call this a College movie than you'd love the Blur of Insanity!...or you can buy it direct from amazon just search for ""The Blur of Insanity"" in only the DVD section.The Blur feature a unique cast including Joshua Leonard from the Blair Witch Project you know the dude who died.In the Blur college sophmouers have screwed up there life for a year in just 2 days.They must get a 4.0 GPA and pay 7 thousand dollars or risk going to prision.A heart-pounding comedy that will keep you entertained for hours.I know that I can keep whatching it because it never gets boring.I encourage everyone please don't waste money on old school but instead the Blur of Insanity."
1,THE ANSWER TO THE MID-LIFE CRISIS--NOT!,"What does a mild-mannered thirty-year-old businessman do after he catches the early flight home and discovers his woman in a sado-masochistic tryst? Why, the same thing you and I would, of course--he starts a fraternity! All those New Age philosophers who think the key to manhood lies in the ""inner child"" have found their cinematic manifesto in this bomb. Stuffed start to finish with farcical crudity and tasteless ""jokes,"" ""Old School"" caters to that inexplicably loud & proud American caste that believes sobriety and responsibility are the great evils of society and that everything is okay as long as you can make it to the next party. Unfunny and offensive, ""Old School"" is a sad waste of celluloid."
1,Where were the funny parts,"I thought this movie was going to be funny, since I've heard it was better than Animal House. Where are the funny scenes? There were about 3 or 4 parts that were kind of funny, but that's about it. To compare it to Animal House is a joke. I can't count how many funny things happen in Animal House, Something About Mary, American Pie, Tommy Boy....because these movies are really funny. Old School was just kind of dumb. Maybe I just don't get Will Ferril. He starts streaking about 5 minutes into the first party, and I guess it's supposed to be funny that no one follows him, but that's it. He streaks thru the town and his wife sees him, but nothing funny happens. I guess I just didn't get this movie."
3,"That's right, it's old school stuff","It's got a few funny parts, but when I saw it in the theater, I was bored in the first half. I was wishing I had watched ""About Schmidt"" instead. Much of the storyline doesn't fit. No college would ever let a non-student in a fraternity/sorority. Why do it in ""Old School""? Had this movie been real life, the dean would have been fired ages ago. His superiors would be way too stupid not to catch him. With the acting, I've seen Vince Vaughn and Luke Wilson perform better, but it's not his fault. It's bad directing. Will Ferrell is same ole, same ole."
3,Crude but amiable humor,"Old School is not the best of its genre, but it's better than average and worthy of a Friday Night checkout. The basic storyline is simple enough: three thirtyish guys start a fraternity in a college town, to prevent a foreclosure on one of the guys' house. Pretty thin premise, but Wilson, Ferrell and Vaughn provide a fair number of laughs as the plot unfolds.The trailers make this movie out to be grosser than it actually is. Except for one tasteless (but funny) sequence featuring comedian Andy Dick as a red-wigged ""b-job"" coach, there's not much that's really very raunchy. You get a minute or so of Will Ferrell's butt, and a few seconds of bare female breasts, and that's about it.Overall, Old School is a good-hearted movie about male early-midlife crisis, that happens to feature a lot of drinking and frat-house shenanigans. This is a high three-star entry, not quite worth four stars, but a ""thumbs up"" nonetheless."
2,Too Predictable,"Will Ferrell is one of those guys where you either really like him, or you don't. I'm a huge fan of his but this movie was crap. I'm entertained by juvenile gross-out comedies as much as the person but the story here is so familiar that I actually started to roll my eyes. Story is about Mitch Martin (Luke Wilson) who is in his early 30's and one night he catches his girlfriend Heidi (Juliette Lewis) having orgies. He moves out and lives in a house near the University and when his best friend Bernard (Vince Vaughn) finds out he convinces him to start a fraternity so that they can party every night and meet girls. They throw a wild party one night and Mitch's buddy Frank (Will Ferrell) gets wasted and goes streaking but is caught by his wife who throws him out of the house. Frank ends up living with Mitch and the three of them quickly become legends on campus. It's been done do death."
5,Good Times At OLD SCHOOL High!!,"Basicly a remake of a classic about adults that don't want to grow up.This movie is cool, I suggest you watch it at least once!!I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!!"
5,Too funny for words....,"I went into seeing this movie with a poor attitude, considering that most movie they claim now a days, funny, are really poor in plot and usually never make me laugh. I found this movie to be funny and had me rolling on the floor a couple of times, I would recommend this to people that are sick of funny movies, not being so funny afterall."
2,Just Doesn't Come Together,"If you thought Will Ferrell was funny in this movie, you should immediately pick up THE BEST OF WILL FERRELL from the ""Saturday Night Live"" DVD series.OLD SCHOOL is not--I repeat NOT--the ANIMAL HOUSE of this generation or the 21st Century.It just doesn't come together. Despite a few sporadically funny scenes, the story never comes together and the characters are never as developed as the Deltas and Omegas from ANIMAL HOUSE.I've just read an article about how today's comedy is reaching the high standards of the 70's/80's (BLAZING SADDLES, SNL, SCTV, Monty Python, ANIMAL HOUSE, CADDYSHACK)--but the only problem is that this current crop of comic filmmakers have yet to produce a bonafide classic.Recycling TV shows (STARSKY & HUTCH) and youth/college formulas are not the way to do it.But if they choose that route, they should at least make something funny."
2,Not as good as all the hype,"I was expecting a movie that I would be laughing my [behind] off at. This movie isnt that. I did laugh a few times but after a while it got boring. Will Ferrell wasnt funny enough. Most of National Lampoon's movies are better then this, and this isnt a new ""Animal House"""
4,Instant Classic,"For all of you reading thinking ""how in the world is this getting a 5star from some and 1star from others?!?!?"" Have no fear, THIS IS A FUNNY MOVIE. I love Animal House, this is not animal house, but this FUNNY. I was rolling on the ground while watching it."
3,MEDIOCRE and nothing more,"Old School has its good points and its bad points. The movie is good, although they revealed way too much in the trailers. It is not nearly as funny as Road Trip or other college comedies. I was slightly annoyed at how they pumped this movie up so much, and it wasn't that funny. Anyways, the DVD is better. The ""UNRATED"" EDITION features nothing more than a few more women walking around topless and a scene that is rauchier. Nothing spectacular. The Extra features are good. The extended scenes are hilarious, and I wonder why the didn't put these in the movie...it would have made the movie funnier. Also, the blooper reel is very funny. There are a couple of standard 8 minute documentaries and the normal trailers and cast etc. Nothing spectacular. The menus get very repetitive and the music is VERY ANNOYING. IN conclusion, if you loved this movie, you'll love this dvd. If you thought the movie was okay...save your money."
4,FUNNY!,"I thought it looked incredibly stupid at first, but I was laughing the whole time through! The acting is good, Will Ferrell is hilarious, and the script is superb!I give Old School 4 stars instead of 5 because while I loved it, some of the jokes were a bit... tasteless....and I didn't think the 2 naked girls wrestling in KY Jelly was really necessary.I don't usually like most ""teen"" comedies these days, but this was great. I definitely recommend it if you want a good laugh."
3,Another teen movie. 15th april 2004.,"It's one of them teen movies, if you are into them sorts of movies this is perfect for you. I like some of them, and don't get me wrong this is pretty good but i have seen better. I always think well by looking at the box cover, and reading the reviews on it which i normally do, i thought by what it actually says it is funny i normally go for funny movies. I didn't laugh at it at all i don't think it is funny. Some older people might find it a laugh though. There are on similararities to this film or any other i have seen. I could imagine it been like that [not another teen movie]which i have never seen."
1,Total Crap,"I'm a fan of Will Ferrell & was fully expecting to like this movie. Wrong! I suppose that if I were a teenage boy or a miserably unhappy married male, I would have enjoyed it, but no such luck. What a waste of time and money : ("
4,A Classic Comedy,"A group of guys having a mid-life crisis decides to go back to college and relive their better days. They decide to start a new fraternity. They friends go on a hunt to recruit the right members. This movie is the story of those guys and the rejects that they find to join them. The Dean doesn't like their plan and has made it his personal mission to get them expelled.This movie is totally hilarious. It has a pretty good cast, a fun story, and classic comedy moments that you'll never forget. This version contains some racey deleted scenes and has 5.1 Dolby Digital audio. This is a must see for any fan of the comedy genre."
5,"""You're my boy, Blue!!!""","A great comedy. One of my top 10, if not top 5 favorite movies. Hilarious performances by most of the cast, and a great story about an off beat frat house. ""You're my boy, Blue!!!"" Grab this one up!"
5,Great Initiate into a Great Tradition,"I laughed for a good 60 to 70 minutes during this film. It starts right at the beginning and really does not let up. Critics are really funny about this film ... they seem to take shots at the movie because it's not some stuffy MIRAMAX-let's-buy-us-an-Oscar-type film, yet they all admit that they laughed?!?It's a film can not be a comedy for the sake of being a comedy. Films that make an audience laugh this much should be hailed and not pilloried."
2,"Had Great potential, but blew it.","Old School is a movie of great potential. Three adults, played by the capable cast of Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughan and Luke Wilson, have all hit a crossroads in life and circumstances force Luke Wilson's character to move into a house on a college campus. There is the obligatory wild party and crazy college antics, but Old School seems like a movie without a clue of what it wants to be about. Is this going to be a movie just about crazy adults who start a college fraternity, or is it going to be about some crazy adults who are trying to find their way in life, and along the way start a fraternity. Scenes seem spliced together, going from a frat party to a birthday party for Vince Vaughan's kids. Then the conclusion is incredibly ridiculous. This movie would have been better if more time had been spent on how Wilson, Vaughan and Ferrell came out winners instead of just showing how their frat beat the dean of the school."
3,"not too original, but has it's moments","No, there's nothing too original here but I'd say it's worth a rental just to see the wedding band's rendition of 'Total Eclipse of the Heart'. I must have watched that sequence 20 times before I could stop crying I was laughing so hard. Will Ferrell does a good job, Vince Vaughn is characteristically annoying, but Luke Wilson seemed to be relegated to playing the straight man for most of the film."
5,Old School,This is by far the best movie i have ever seen...Will Ferrell makes this movie great. The movies basiclly about three middle aged guys who start a fraternity and live the time of there life in a few brief weeks before (luke wilson) gives the bachlor life up to go for a girl he had a crush on in high school. All in all this movies very funny and worth seeing
5,...,"This movie had non stop laughs with many clichets wedding singers, a academic challenge like that in billy madison, and a ... dean like animal house. Even though you could predict wat was gonna happen this movie totally kicked ... very funny a must buy if u enjoyed road trip very well done."
2,UNRATED,"For those of you looking to purchase this DVD, one bit of advice - remember it's UNRATED. As soon as you put the DVD in, the menu pops up showing two women with no shirt on. This was highly offensive and undesired (especially with my spouse next to me). There's also a lot of curse words. The movie is still pretty funny, hence the 2 stars."
3,Same ol' same ol',"This is the typical Ferrell movie. Funny at times lame at others. If you are a fan of his you will certainly enjoy this, if you are not a fan of his you may want to look other places for your viewing pleasure."
1,Will Ferrell in all his glory.,"So this is what Will Ferrell has been doing since leaving NBC's Saturday Night Live. Will Certainly likes to reveal his talents doesn't he? Jeremy Piven has been known to do university students-act-like-kids movies, but this time he is a Dean. Vince Vaughn plays a smart-aleck."
1,Old School is Vulgar,i dont get these teen movies anymore theyre vulgar and naugty. Kids want to see them because they want to see some sex but thaats beond the point. The point is that these movies like Old School go overboard. The olny teen movie I enjoyed was American Pie. It was vulgar but not as vulgar as Old School. In Old School theres this Old man who's in a tub with naked woman and hes telling them to stroke his lobes how is that funny. I think its iommature and gross
2,MEDIOCRE AT BEST,"It starts off okay, but the laughs are too far and inbetween. Will Farell is okay, but he starts to get annoying about halfway through. Luke Wilson is really good in quirky roles, but he fails miserably as the straight man here. Vince Vaughn is great as always, but he can't save it. Rent this one."
2,POINTLESS!,"Old School is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! Will Ferrel is one of the greatest American comedy actors ever. But if I was basing his career on this movie. I'd say he's one of the worst. This movie was a bland, boring movie with a predictable ending. I won't spoil it, but I'm sure you've seen this kind of ending numerous times. This comedy had some funny parts, but that's the only reson it gets 2 stars. The story line was terrible. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!"
3,Don't sit still,"This is a funny movie, but it is not worth sitting still. Plan to do a lot of multi tasking while you watch."
3,Ranuncgy campus comedy,Not the best movie of this type i have ever watched. there are bits of comedy and very little sex or inneundos. but is still watchable
3,what? unrated? whats the difference?,"This movie is hilarious, and I would give the movie itself 4 our of 5 stars. But there is hardly any difference between the unrated cut and the R rated cut of the movie. When you have topless women on the menu and on the back of the cover, one might be mislead to think there was tons more nudity, when in reality there are 2 brief scenes with any type of nudity (besides will ferrel's butt scene). This movie could have easily passed the R rating cut, as the unrated thing is nothign but a marketing ploy. I bought the movie for laughs and definately not for sex, but for someone who does, the ""UNRATED AND OUT OF CONTROL"" part is quite misleading."
5,Great movie!!!!!!,"A new comedy classic!!! I don't know how much blu-ray does for this flick, but it sure looks great on my screen!! Thumbs up!"
3,DVD version's better,Can u believe that there are more extras in the DVD version?it's true.. i own both.
2,Didn't work for me,"I was hoping that I would enjoy watching Old School, since it had Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn. It failed to make me laugh. I know lots of other people admire this film, but I didn't find it very funny. Sure, the plot worked and the characters were actually convincing, but I found the jokes to be very weak in many parts. Oh well, next time when I watch this comedy again, maybe then I'll find it extremely hilarious."
1,Not the product I purchased,I received the DVD in the mail the other day. When I opened it up the product was not what I ordered (The Transporter 2 not Old School). I don't think I should have to pay the shipping and handling for a mess up that is not mine! This is completly unexceptable!!
4,"Way ""Old School""","How old are these guys? That one guy was almost a hundred years-old! ""Old School"" was a very funny movie and Frank ""The Tank"" (Will Ferrell) was pure laughtersome (genius!). You're crazy man, you're crazy. The part where Mitch Martin (Luke Wilson) and his buddies kidnapped their pledges was hilarious and the BJ instructor (Andy Dick) was hysterically witty! Crouching Tiger, Hidden Twig was off-the-wall comedy. Earmuffs were awesome once Vince Vaughn said, ""FSB."" This movie was great."
4,Pretty Damn Good,"I am a huge Animal House fan so when they compared Old School to it I was very excited. Will Ferrell is hilarious in this movie. He practically carries it. Ohhh and Vince Vaughn is pretty good to. Not a must see, but go see for some great laughs."
4,Hilarious!,"The story is about three guys in their thirties who decide to start their own fraternity. They say that it's to save Luke Wilson's character from losing his house, but really it's just an excuse for them to party, get drunk, and have lots of fun again. I had very low expectations for this movie because I'm not a big fan of Will Ferrel - he's never really made me laugh that much before... But this movie shocked me at how funny it really is. Don't expect to be watching an Oscar contender; but it's not meant to be one. It's meant to be stupid and silly and funny - and it is. watch it! you'll laugh!"
3,Some humorous moments...,"I rented this film after it was recommended by many of my friends. I expected it to be a laugh-a-minute ride into the world of youth remembered. While there are several humorous moments to be enjoyed, overall it was not as hilarious as I expected it to be. In my opionion, this film should have focused more on delivering laughs then delivering a message. I give this film 3 stars."
5,"""i see blue...and he looks glorious!""",This movie had me laughing non stop throughout the whole thing. It was soo funny and I think that the cast was very well put together..sooo funny! i wish i could have rated it better than 5! watch it
2,"Old school, no","I gave this flick a chance because, hey, Luke Wilson, Will Ferrel, and Vince Vaughn are in it. With talent in this movie, I expected alot better. This movie, and Road Trip before it, are horribly directed and contain few laughs. Ferrel was by far the funniest part of this movie (fiery hoop, streaking, and tranq dart scenes.) The movie is pointless, but is a good popcorn movie. It really lacks on original jokes."
3,Lame,"I wasn't expecting high-class comedy from Will Farrell, Vince Vaughn, and Luke Owen, but even so I thought this movie was puerile to the extreme. The movie is filled with stupid characters, sex-related jokes, and drunken orgies. It's a remake of Animal House, but isn't a classic like Animal House. I thought there were a few funny moments with Will Farrell, but the rest of the movie was pretty pathetic. I'd rather watch a good Will Farrell comedy, such as Kicking and Screaming. This might be worth watching once for a few laughs, but I wouldn't watch it over again."
5,Will Rocks,"Old School is awesome rated R entertainment. Though not all of the material is suitable for everyone, there was a target audience in mind when this was made, and they nailed a bulls-eye. This is a movie about some guys just about 10 years removed from the college scene and eventually try breaking back into that life style by setting up a unique frat house. There are some trials and tribulations that have to go on before the house can get totally set up and the movie takes you through the journey.The cast was awesome, so many funny men that worked wonderfully with each other. These guys are becoming the corner stone in the comedy movie industry these days and that couldn't make me happier. If you love that college humor kind of comedy and are a fan of people like Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn, then this movie needs to be on your shelf."
5,A CLASSIC,"This movie will be writen down in the pantheon of comedy classics such as Animal House, Caddy shack, Stripes, and Rushmore. The film is a well done comedy - not an easy feat, as anyone knows that has sat through a bad one. The writing is great, and my buddies and I know the lines by memory and send lines via email during the day.For example: ""This house is practically on campus, its sick. How did you score this?""""It was pretty easy really...a professor lived for 30 years and just died.""""That is awesome....pause....awesome (while giving a high-five)"" ****** Priceless"
3,Rejoice the Frat Moment...,"Mitch (Luke Wilson) arrives at home earlier than expected to surprise his fiancé Heidi (Juliette Lewis), but it turns out that Mitch is the one who is getting surprised by his fiancé's activities outside their relationship. When Mitch's friend Frank (Will Ferrell) gets married he finds himself deeply depressed, which Beanie (Vince Vaughn) recognizes. When Mitch moves into a new house close to a university campus Bernie comes up with the great idea that they should start a fraternity in order to get Mitch to get over Heidi and back into the dating business. Old School is a hilarious comedy that offers some morals in an extremely funny way, however, the last act of the film seemed rushed which caused some awkwardness in the story. In the end the audience is left with a good cinematic experience that will cause multiple laughs, and maybe offer some lessons."
2,What's the Hype about this?,"I watched this on DVD yesterday and wasn't impressed. The plot is taken from movies such as Animal House and Revenge of the Nerds: Misfits overcome adversity to prevail. The comedy is funny, but not that funny. The most intriguing character is Vince Vaughn's: the party boy and instigator of all the craziness who is carrying around his son the whole time being a dad. Other than that, a lot of the movie is a let down. What's the point of that one fat guy doing the vault with the scrawny guy spotting him? He does the vault successfully with no squashing the little guy. Big whoop. That pretty much summarizes the movie. Lots of build up with no payoff."
2,Old unispired and it often is tedious,"There are some fine performances in this movie, just don't count Luke Wilson amoung them. Does this guy act or just sit with an absolutely vacant expression while the movie rolls past him? Any scene with Frank the Tank is good enough reason to buy this movie, but on the whole it's a big disapointment just because of what it could have been. Not very funny but on occassion entertaining. Then again, once you watch Old School, I think you'll appreciate Animal House with a quasi-religious feeling. Old School is Old Hat, no...it's an old shoe! My advice...wait until it comes out on USA Network, which should be soon."
2,Occasionally funny; jumps around a lot,"This is Amazon's property, meaning they can do with it what they want."
2,the describption was wrong,"The seller enter the description as a number and it showed it had infotrack (the computer access code) as if the book was new, however it didn't, so it was pretty much useless. I contacted the seller and she did give me a refund, the seller was very gracious and understood her mistake."
5,good,convenient and good condition . if you STUDY MPA this thing can be taken with you bec it is very useful
1,Boring,This is a very boring and dry read. The print is small and the chapters are long. I had a hard time reading even portions of this. Get it at the library if you have to read this book for a class.
4,Great toning!,"This is a good all-around work-out with an appropriate balance of cardio and toning. She does a lot of reps of the toning exercises! If you're looking for fancy choreography, you'll probably be disappointed. The Step and Hi-lo combinations are fairly basic. I also like the ""class"" participants. They look more like normal people, not skinny actresses."
4,smells great,"Great fresh, natural, light scent. Got many compliments. Glad I was able to find this item, will give as gifts"
5,Entertaining and informative,"In his analysis of the crash of 1929, the great JKG provides insights into human nature and the web in which we entangle ourselves. His observations are relevant in 2012, more than 50 years after he wrote them and over 80 years since the crash of 1929. Then and now, important men who were regarded as capable and intelligent prove unable to act rationally when a speculative bubble is alive. I was intrigued by his analysis of how the collapsing market of 1929 - 1932 irresistibly lured virtually all of the players into its vortex, to their ultimate ruin.The book is witty and wry, delightful and informative, proving that Galbraith was capable of producing clear prose when he wanted to."
3,In a nutshell --- IRRATIONAL EXUBERANCE,"The more things change, the more they stay the sameGreenspan used the words ""irrational exuberance"" in the late 90s to describe investor activities that were driving up the ""value"" of stocks (many of which had no BUSINESS value). Unfortunately, he and the Fed never took appropriate action to rein it in, and the market ultimately crashed.In this book, Galbraith reveals numerous examples of ""irrational exuberance"" by investors that foreshadowed the 1929 crash.The actual decline of the stock market was a bit frustrating to follow since the book is all text, with no charts/graphs. And Galbraith keeps changing the stocks he quotes price declines on. Perhaps that's irrelevant, since the CAUSE of the crash was fairly well laid out."
1,kindle version is almost unreadable,"The _book_ by Galbraith is fine, but the Kindle version is almost unreadable. If you popped the book onto a copy machine then spilled coffee all over it you'd get a better copy than this. It's FILLED with typos that were not in the printed version. Would it have been so difficult Houghton Mifflin Mariner to have proofread this thing? I can sometimes figure out what the garbled number or word is supposed to be, but not all the time."
4,Galbraith - surprise,"To tell the true, I have always been little bit sceptical about J. K. G., but this book surprised me in very positive way. It could be used as a textbook for the History of Economic Policy! Easy reading, lot of datas, interesting points of view... Strongly recommended for all economicsts."
1,A grinding boring read with little upside.,"I hated this book, its boring and written in oldy time text and I got very little out of the book in the end. I would highly suggest Lords of Finance, Ascent of Money, The forgotten man, Devil take the Hindmost or simply tinkering on the internet. This book is only good for people writing a dissertation on 1929 alone. Avoid."
1,If you are a liberal you will love this book,"In his book he BASHES Corporations, views government as incompetent missing many opportunities stop or avert the crash and aftermath it caused.Basic facts are correct (dates, names and events), BUT his conclusions are all wrong (think Paul Krugman).If you think BIGGER AND BIGGER government is the solution to all problems you will love this book."
4,Spritely,"A spritely account of the days leading up to the great crash. A must read from a historical perspective, and some useful normative accounts."
2,Boring and confusing,"Good regards historic detail, confusing as regards explaining causes and not very good in connecting the relationships betwwen siginiicant players."
2,Hard to understand,"I had to read this book for a history class in college. Being someone who knows absolutely nothing about the stock market, I found this book very hard to understand and follow. It was slow and did not keep my attention. I think if you know about the stock market and are interested in the causes of the crash it would be a good book for you, but not for someone who has no knowledge of the stock market going into the book."
3,Has some good points; Superficial,"I am reading this book for a college economics class. It is one of 5 books I have already read on the Great Depression, since I am doing a paper on the subject. I am not so arrogant as to criticize the Economics ability of a Harvard professor in the subject, but I will say this book is superficial. It just glosses over the Crash in a jaunty sort of way. I do think it has some good points (shortness being one of them), and I will use it to illustrate one perspective when I write my paper, but there are a lot of books out there where the author clearly spent about 100 times longer thinking about what might have caused the Crash than JKG has put forth here.One good thing: it captures the mood of the recent 1999/2000 stock bubble so perfectly that you could just about change the names and dates and re-release the same book. The more things change, in some cases, the more they stay the same."
5,A must read !,"This book a must for those interested in the ""...this time is different..."" phenomenon. It is very well written and not too technical. Enjoy."
5,Interesting and useful,This book is very easy to read and very useful. Shows how history book should be written. Recommended by Buffett himself:)
5,Learning,"I was very glad to get this book, because it gives me an idea of what it was like during the crash and how long it lasted. My father-in-law and I didn't get together enough for me to find out from him his experience. He came real close to stealing in order to feed his new baby before he was offered the job of iceman. He was very glad to have the job.This book fills in the blanks I have in my education of this subject.Well written."
4,Fun and Relevant,"Terrific writing. Insightful, serious, edifying and entertaining. So many of the players have not changed, it's a great read for these times."
3,bad,"Amazon needs to get it's act together...I have already submitted a review...I am outraged that the shippping for the $15 item cost $5 more than the cost of the product...I shopped Amazon to SAVE money, not waste it...I will not order from Amazon again and I have placed Amazon in my blocked senders list...I do not want to keep receiving nonsense reviews..."
3,pretty basic stuff,"Pretty run of the mill basic sports betting info, fine for neophytes. Better info out there, but a decent read."
3,One of the better books on NFL Sports betting,"I find Gordon's book to be one of the better books on how to find winners vs the line. However, the suggested approach is at some points described in a less than cristal clear fashion."
3,Some Pops and Graininess,"In general a great CD. Another reviewer complained about background noise. I didn't hear it on all the tracks, but it was definitely there (and annoying) on at least a couple."
3,Nice but Noisy,"As a casual fan I was surprised by the noiseon the track. You might choose to hearthe noise as a pleasing retro background. ThisCD is probably great for Segovia experts, butif you're looking for nice background musicjust be aware it will sound like the old vinylit was remastered from."
2,Great Track Selection but Not So Great Sound!,"This is a good sampling of the great master's earlier works and I suppose given the age of the recordings, it's inevitable that the sound quality would suffer. It doesn't help when this album is recorded in Mono from an ADD master source as well. What this means is that the sound quality is very poor indeed. Given the state-of-the-art sound engineering technology that is out there these days, I hope EMI decides to revisit the vaults and dig up the best preserved master tapes and remaster these in stereo and clean up as much of the sound as is possible for re-release. That would be the only way to do justice to the memory of this all-time guitar great. They've already done this with Django Reinhardt's early work and so it's about time they got around to updating and remastering the Segovia catalog. I, for one, will be waiting for the day with great anticipation..."
5,Diaper nirvana!!!,"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these diapers!!!!!! They fit soooo well from newborn on, of course I do have big babies (10lbs, 4oz), so the fit may be a bit bulky on a smaller newborn, but what cloth diapers aren't, unless they don't absorb very well.. which rather defeats the purpose!! LOL The only downside is that the aplix closure tabs & laundry tabs seem to wear out fairly quick on these diapers, but the company does provide new ones if that happens. Their customer service IS THE BEST!!!! The tabs are not enough to keep me from buying them though, because the diapers are THAT GREAT!!!!! LOVE THEM!!!! I have them in every color, except white because that is just too boring!! LOL"
4,Not the best diaper when the baby is small,"Now that my baby is older and larger, I do like this diaper. We tried using these when he was a newborn and they were Huge on him! Then when he first starting sitting up with the front end of the diaper folded over to the last roll of snaps he would always fall over because he had so much bulky diaper. When he was big enough to use the first row of snaps for the fold down I started to like them much better and they became more practical. I was going to order a few more but after checking out their web site I found that there products are made in BOTH the USA and Egpyt and I'm not sure how I feel about that. There are plenty of other one size cloth diapers that are made only in the USA."
1,They Leak,"Not sure if we are doing something wrong, however, we have been using disposables for 18 months and decided to try the cloth ones to save money and the environment. Although they fit nicely on our kid, they leaked within the first hour of use. Judging from almost 100% positive reviews here, I feel very surprised and disappointed. They fell very comfortable thought."
5,"Converted me from Disposables!! Perfect, a bit bulky","I was spending 75 a month on disposables, and bought 3 pairs to see if these were as good as all the reviews. Converted me. Sure - scrapping the poop stinks, but saving 75 a month on disposables makes that minor chore more bearable. Plus - if you dry out some baby wipes and place one in the BumGenius, the poop lifts straight out! No messy poop to scrape off. You need about 12 pairs to only do laundry every 3 days. I still use disposables overnight - to prevent overnight leaks. Otherwise, were 100% BumGenius. When compared to Fuzzibuns and Little G GDiapers, these are superior to both."
4,Great initially,"We bought the Bum Genius One Size diapers when my son was about 3 months old, after trying biodegradables, G-diapers and regular cloth. They were superb. So easy to use and no leaks EVER! That however was then. My son is now 19 months old and we had hoped to use these same diapers on our next baby, but over the last two or three months they have really started to fall apart. The elastic is gone or going on all (we have 22), and the velcro is starting to lose its stick too. It's been a great run - over a year, with multiple hot washes and no complaints, but sadly we are going to have to say goodbye. My overall impression is fantastic, but for those of you who think these will be the only diapers you ever buy, think again. I would certainly recommend them as a wonderful alternative to disposables, and probably the easiest and most effective cloth diapers on the market."
3,Okay but not the best out there,"These are not the best cloth diapers out there. They are not made from natural materials and we had problems with the diapers causing rashes on my son. They require more maintenance than regular cloth to get the smell out. They are VERY bulky. Even though they are ""one-size"" they are way too big for a newborn. The velcro can irritate baby's skin as well.The only positive I found was that they are very absorbent. Other than that I would not recommend these diapers."
4,"Overall happy, but could use some instructions","Overall, I am happy with the BG diapers, but would like more instructions. It comes with a newborn and one size insert. When is the newborn insert suppose to be used? I was using it, but am now much happier once I switched to the other insert. It is a bit hard to wrap around my daughter is thin and would like to know how them recommend wrapping it. For example, should the velro be folded, etc. I am new to cloth diapering and would have liked a bit more direction. We also sometimes have an issue with the snap sizing the diaper down coming undone when we are putting it on her."
3,OK but bulky,"I've used this diaper for a while and I Guess I may just not like pocket style diapers. I do not at all like microfiber for inserts, it is leaky when compressed. If you stuff it with something more aborbant, then it is very bulky. I like the bumgenus organics a lot better!"
4,Happy with our new diapers!,"I have been very pleased with these diapers! The ajustable snaps are great! I don't know how they would do with a newborn size booty, but for my 1 year old they are great! I do still use disposable diapers, due to the fact that we only have 6 BumGenius diapers and my daughter can go through 6 in one day. I will say, I do get tired of doing the laundry and having reusable diapers adds to the load. But totally worth the extra work!"
5,Great,"I purchased these diapers for my grand-daughter for Christmas, my DIL said they are wonderful. This is my second purchase of these diapers first time I bought pink before she was born."
4,Very soft diaper,"Bumgenius are probably the softest diaper I have used on my son. They don't seem to hold stains like some of the other diapers and fit very well (so no leaks). However, they are expensive and take a long time to dry. I prefer the pocket diapers."
3,"Great at first, but don't hold up to extended wear","I was thrilled with these diapers for the first six months. At that point, I started noticing some serious pilling and lack of stickiness with the velcro. I thought it was just me, but a friend who bought at the exact same time had the same issue. Within three more months, the diapers were essentially useless unless my sons were wearing jeans over them to keep the frayed tabs from catching on their clothes and letting go.Go with snaps. You'll be happier."
3,Great for first few months...get snaps!!!,"The velcro wears out quickly, even if you follow directions. The diapers needed another shell to keep them on, or other clothes, at about 12 months. However, the snap diapers still work great. Sadly, we only purchased 2 snaps because we thought the velcro diapers were a better choice. There does not seem to be a way to replace the velcro so that it can work again. For the money, get the snap diapers and you'll be thrilled you did!"
2,not worth the money,"I bought these diapers for my daughter to use on her daughter. They didn't fit my granddaughter until she was nearly a month old and she was an average size baby at birth. They are easy to put on the baby and work well once on. They are a huge pain to reassemble after washing. After about one year of use, the velcro quit sticking very well and the diapers were looking very worn. When my granddaughter was a little over a year, she was too large for the diapers despite being well within the advertised size range. I replaced them with a much less expensive alternative-fitted diapers with separate covers, that were just as absorbent, did not require any reassembly prior to use after washing and large enough to fit her until she was potty trained. In summary, bum genius diapers are not worth the money."
2,Velcro doesn't work,This Bumgenius is quite good as there is no leakage except that the velcro stops working in couple of weeks making the diaper useless; go for Fuzzi bunz instead.
5,Great diapers!,"This is a great diaper. Even though its not the 3.0, I've never had a problem with wicking at the top. Absorbant inserts and no leaks."
4,Great if you have a front-loader....,"These were excellent, 5-star all the way until we had to downgrade from a front-loading washer to a top-loading washer. After just a few washes, the laundry tabs were shot, and now all the velcro sticks together, get wound up, and they come out in one big string of diapers. By the time I'm done unvelcro-ing everything, the fabric separates, tears, and comes undone.Other than that, they're great!"
3,Babies are different...,"Like most parents to be, my husband and I read the reviews and made our purchase in advance. The bum genius had the best reviews, and we felt confident in purchasing enough to meet our cloth diapering needs before our son was born. Sadly, it didn't work out...perhaps because we ended up having a long, lean baby with relatively larger thighs. The bumgenius seemed tight in the legs while never fitting well in the waist. Our baby never seemed comfortable, and we never made the switch fully to cloth diapers. My advice to parents to be - WAIT until your baby is born, and try a bunch of different cloth diapers. All babies are different, and there is no perfect diaper for every child. The fuzzibunz seem to be a better fit for our baby, and we will be trying them next. I like that Fuzzibunz has adjustable elastic in the legs, which allows us to fit our hard to fit baby."
2,At least knock a few bucks off for an older version.,"I had the 3.0 in my wishlist, and when g-ma ordered some for baby, this is what she got. I believe they ARE the 3.0s, but are probably backstock from before they started putting in the infant sized insert. Why they don't just say THAT on the description I don't know. If they want to sell them to get rid of the stock without that extra insert, they could knock a few bucks off them. I usually use them for nighttimes with my baby anyway, so I don't mind the bulk of the full sized insert.the diaper is great, the way amazon is selling them annoys me enough to knock them all the way down to 2 stars. You can get them direct from this seller for the same price with an extra insert."
1,I don't recommend,At first I liked the product even though it is a pain to wash and a somewhat gross task. I figured its for the environment. When my daughter was 15 months more than half of the diapers started coming apart with the velcro. I spend over 400 dollars in diapers and they are defective. The company gave me a hard time returning them to be fixed. I had to pay my own shipping and handling for their defective product. I would not recommend these as it has been a huge inconvenience.
3,"Review of PRODUCT DESCRIPTION, not product.","I'm reviewing the product description not the product because I've found the product description is confusing. This product is listed as a bumGenius 2.0 one-size cloth diaper. However, I believe that the 2.0s are AIO (all in one) diapers and are sized diapers. The bumGenius 3.0 diapers are pocket diapers with inserts and are made so that one size fits all. This product is a pocket diaper designed to fit all. Is this product mislabeled? Perhaps it is really a bumGenius 3.0? This needs to be addressed! Also, please note that many other websites offer this diaper for the same price with two pocket inserts, not just one. So make note of this if you don't want to fork out the extra $3 for the newborn insert that should come with this diaper on amazon.com but doesn't."
5,Best diaper I've found,"These diapers are ""genius"" -- for so many reasons. One size makes them very economically attractive. My daughter is growing so fast she is out of the sized diapers so quickly and at average $18 a diaper this gets painful financially. These diapers are very well made, user friendly and most importantly keep the runny poops in! They fit snug and cosy, clean up nicely and don't leave nasty red marks around her legs. I've tried prefolds and diaper covers(Bummis Whisper light) as well as Happy Heinys pocket diapers. I found the BumGenius by far superior."
4,The only cloth diaper we use!,"I invested in 14 of these dipes when my daughter was born. We started using them exclusively when she was 6 months old (she's 11 months now). There have been very few leaks, fewer than we have had with disposable. We usually use a disposable overnight, since she nurses all night long and wets heavily, but on the few occasions that we have used a BG 3.0 it has held up for 12 hours with no leaking. The only complaint I have is the stinky pee smell that happens on occasion (usually if I have NOT followed the directions and left hem sitting for more than the recommended 2 days). To combat this I have added a TINY amount of bleach to the wash and washed the inserts again- no pee smell. Sunning the dipes in the summer time helps, too."
2,Apple MacBook MA699LL,Product was defective - battery won't recharge - no longer works unless plugged in to outlet. Trying to get Amazon to replace. We'll see.
2,ordered one MacBook,"was sent 2 MacBooks. Credit was given for second MacBook which was refused, but it was some trouble dealing with it and keeping track to make sure credit was given."
3,Good computer marred by sharp edge and busy fan,"A couple of widely reported problems bring down the rating of what would otherwise be a fine computer. First, for reasons impossible to fathom, Apple released this model with a sharp edge around the case, so that if you rest your palm on the edge when using the trackpad and button, it literally causes pain after a few minutes. It doesn't affect me when I'm typing, but is really irritating when using a browser, when normally my hand would rest near the trackpad for long stretches. Second, the fan seems to run 100% of the time, or close to it, producing an annoying sound if you are in a quiet environment, and reducing battery time."
4,"4 1/2 Starts, good hardware, but not perfect.","I'm very happy purchasing my first Mac book after being a PC person ever since I started using computers. I only give this a 4 1/2 starts because its not perfect, but its a nice change from using a PC. After I saw Vista was pre-installed on every PC laptop out there, I thought that a mac that can run both OS and Windows XP was right up my ally. Overall this is a nice machine that is powerful, stable, and for the most part very easy to use. I have yet to tinker with what a mac has to offer, but I don't mind learning, since Mircosofts failure to provide was a blessing for Macs alike. There are only a few things l'd like to point out on the designs. The way you rest your hands, the edges feel sharp on your palms, so prolong periods of typing isn't going to be very confertable. Other then the minor adjustments, this hardware matches up nicely to any laptop even for the price, this is the better investment."
3,all good but 2 things,"1. the edge is jagged, sharp and unrounded. It cuts my wrist especially when I type on the macbook on my knees.2. CPU is easy to be heated. As long as my cpu usage is more 30%, the fan will reach 6000 rpm within 20 seconds"
5,Macbook MA701LL,I'm lovin this notebook. Very small and compact. I would buy another one if I had the money. Maybe a white one.
4,Black mac makes me the mack.,"I already used the Macbook Pro for over a year now and I picked this up for my wife to replace her older laptop. After testing it out for a month already, I do recommend this laptop.For close to half the price of the Macbook Pro, it includes a lot of the features: great build quality, simple and elegant looks, and blazingly fast performance. It also would be the choice mac for people on the go as it does have better battery life and a smaller form factor.Definitely, I would have liked a few things: 2GB of RAM would be on par with similar PC models and the monitor adaptor should have been included in the box rather than charging $20 as an accessory. I think for the extra money spent on the black finish, these extra's should have been included.Aside from that, my wife loves the lappy which is the most important thing for me!"
5,Macbook: just perfect,"Great in features, standard applications, looks, simplicity and mobility! Overrules all you eventually Windows neccessairies. Opens them and writes them back in any (Windows) file format you want.Easy synchronisation possibility (iSync and .mac) with other Mac (also PC?)Bye it or keep on dreaming."
5,For Leaders in Transition,"This slim volume is concise, to the point, and a quick read, which contains some essentials for the pastor or other leader who needs to know how to say 'farewell,"" whether circumstances are great or uncomfortable. Oswald is an expert. Rev. Mary Latela"
4,Mr. Beer 3 pack,"I have just started brewing with Mr. Beer. If you enjoy beer, this is a fun way to get started in making your own quality beer. As long as you only want to brew 2 1/2 gallons at time, this is perfect. If you want more, you should start with this and then ""graduate"" to more advanced systems.The 3 pack offers a multitude of varieties if you also purchase Unhopped Malt Extract (UME) from Mr. Beer. There are a lot of recipes on the Mr. Beer site that make the 3 packs you have purchased very versatile.I would give this 5 stars, except for the fact that you have to throw away the yeast that comes with it. It is not strong or consistent. You should go to a local brew store and purchase fresh ale or lager yeast. You won't be dissapointed."
5,Perfect For Heavy Drinkers Who Want To Slow Down,"Brewing your own beer isn't necessarily cheaper, but my alcoholic friends say it slows down their imbibing to a tolerable level by forcing them to only drink as much as they can brew. The mix and yeast are exactly as described. Imagine my joy when I unboxed a product that exceeded my expectations for quality and ease of use. This product is fantastic."
3,all right,not a big fan of the canadian draft and the octoberfest was only so-so. i have made great brews with the wheat weizenbeer though. tip: find something to mix in with these like fruit or other ingredients to help the flavor and increase alcohol content.
5,"Good beer, great price.","So far we've had plenty of success with our Mr. Beer home brewing kit. After we made the two batches that came with the kit, we decided to give some more exotic flavors a shot.So far so good! The beer has great flavor, and really can be done in as few as 3 weeks for the minimum. We've done more than the minimum by going out as far as 4 weeks in the keg and 4 weeks in the bottles before conditioning, and the results were worth it.For the simplicity of the Mr. Beer set, the taste is great and that makes the prices more than worth it!"
5,"Great Product, Great gift!","This was a great gift to a beer lover, soon to be beer brewer lover! I also got the variety pack as I read through reviews that said the pale ale wasn't the BEST. But, I haven't heard a complaint yet!Very happy gift giver,Happy shopping!!!"
4,Great product,The product is wonderful. I ordered 3 of them. The box was damaged on every one of them. Which was sad because they were gifts.
4,"Cheap and easy, but not great flavor","I've only made one of the three packets, but it was straightforward and easy to prepare. The flavor was mediocre at best, but I'm not sure if that's my fault or Mr. Beer's. However, for a first-time homebrewer, it was a good starting point. It also made a lot of beer for a low cost compared to other simple homebrew options. I'd recommend it if you're a beginner looking for something cheap and easy to try."
5,Great Value!,This Mr Beer refill pack is a tremendous value. I wish I had known about it earlier. 3 Refills for $30? Amazing. I will buy my refills here from now on
5,Mr. Beer 3-Beer Mix Variety Pack (Purchased on 12/03/2007),Mr. Beer 3-Beer Mix Variety Pack (Purchased on 12/03/2007)I was very satisfied with the above purchase and the quality of item and the fast shipping and from the seller. A pleasure to do business with a company like that. Thanks!
4,Mr. Beer Variety Pack a good deal,Mr. Beer Variety Pack is a good deal here. The Mr. Beer Website itself charges high shipping fees. Everything arrived great from Amazon/Target.
2,like forest gump; you never know what you will get,"i bought 4 of these under the 4-3 program, and they were all not the same. so you do not seem to know which you will get. but mostly what irks me is that two were in very very old, beat up boxes. and the beer made from those were terrible. i wonder if mr beer ponds off to amazon old stock. if so then the yeast and such might well be stale, inactive or something bad. the beer from the newer boxes was but middling beer...have had beer far far better. i would not buy mr beer anymore and have googled other makers and have been happier."
3,Nice system but...,"I've just made to completion my first batch of home brew. I'm impressed with the ease of use and the quality of the products, to include the finished product. It's great beer and a great way to make it.I'm less impressed with the shipping process. It took Amazon many weeks to get my initial Mr. Beer system to me, due to supply I believe. I subsequently ordered additional Mr. Beer products directly from their website and was not impressed with their high shipping charges and very slow shipping/handling times. This would be a five star product if they could work out their shipping delays and costs."
4,Good stuff,"I bought the variety pack and brewed my first batch of Nut Brown ale. It was fairly easy to make except it didnt come with mixing instructions so I had to find them on the internet (I have a different beer maker than a Mr. Beer). Would have been nice to include those.This mix is far better than the other beer mixes that I have tried. It tends to mix easier than the powdered stuff. Overall the beer was tasty, but it needed time to clear up. The first few drinks of it early on were ok but as the beer sat and cleared up it got a lot better, so give it time (2 weeks atleast). Happy Brewing!"
3,Mr. Beer,"I am on my second batch of making beer with the Mr. Beer system. So far, I have not had very good luck but it may a matter of my inexperience rather than poor product. In any case, my last order from Amazon arrived in a very dirty, dusty condition and it is obvious it had sat in a warehouse somewhere for a long time. I wonder if the yeast and starter is still OK. I'll find out when this batch is done. My suggestion: if you order from Amazon and it arrives in a dirty condidtion, return it with an explanation."
5,gift,Very fun gift for my husband. We enjoyed the beer and order another kit. Great for a guy who needs a hobby.
1,Busted merchandise,I bought this variety refill pack along with the beer making kit. The box itself was sticky all over on the outside and when I opened it up one of the white packets was busted all in the box leaving everything inside incredibly sticky. Very unpleasant to find.
3,kit gives plenty of sugar but makes only 2gal stout,"You may want to try another manufacturer since I have used other beer brands and this one is not the best, the kit had some dried yeast in a tiny packet but you would have to buy your own liquid yeast at a brewstore to brew the full quantity of 2 gallons of stout while insuring no contamination, although the kit also contains 12 oz of corn sugar for bottling and some cold method bleach to sterilize....that's about it, haven't tasted the result yet. Others can make as much as 5gal of hopped stout"
2,beer makeing,mr beer is a ok start for someone that dont know if they would like to brew or not and cheep. but you get what you pay for .i do suguest to all that would like to brew great beer to stopand get into a beer system cost is about 60.00 to get started and buy a kit about 20.00 to 30.00 . you can make 2 cases of beerat a time with one kit . i started with mr beer and move on to better brewing . better all the way around. 10 to 14 days iam drinking beer some take longer 5 to7 days before i bottle . if you have questions check a home brewing web site most will help you.
5,Awesome Advanced Step Workout!,"This is a great step workout for people who love complex step choreography. There is a fast-paced warm-up followed by 7 combinations. Seasun then proceeds with a cool-down, core work, and finally a stretch. As far as cueing goes, Seasun is OK. She is not perfect, but I found it fairly easy to follow along even on my first run-through. There is not an excessive amount of TIFTing (taking it from the top).I found this workout to be challenging but doable. I like workouts that engage my brain as well as my body and this definitely fits into that category. If you are at an intermediate/advanced fitness level and enjoy intricate step choreography, you will like this workout."
5,"A lot of work, and a lot of fun","I am not the most coordinated person and the first two times I tried this DVD it made me so frustrated all I could do was cry. It was hard to see what she was doing with my back to the TV! But when I realized that I didn't have to get it all 100% of the time as long as I kept moving and picked up where I could I was fine. I can now do all but the last piece, and that's more because I am just too tired after 45 minutes to keep going. But I love it! I watched each section first and then tried it, that worked pretty well. Once I had an idea of what she was doing her verbal cues made it so I didn't have to look at the TV. Very good cuing. I think I am going to order the other one!"
2,VERY HARD TO FOLLOW,"I do step 3-4 times per week and this instructor is the hardest one I have ever had to follow!!! She acts as if you've been doing her class for years and doesn't do much demonstration. The choreography is VERY advanced and she doesn't have the same rhythm as other instructors you will find on the web i.e. Taylor, Smith, Anderson. If you get frustrated easily, do not buy this tape. It would be a waste of your money. If you're willing to stick with it, it's a tough workout that will get your heart rate up there."
3,Gettin Ready For Candy makin!!,"I was a little sad in this one .It was not the authors usual tall tale style.In several of his books this author gives a history of hunting and fishing,gold hunting in Alaska or details on fishing. I picture him telling these stories as he sits by the fireplace of his Lodge keeping the customers warm and entertained .This book gave details on candy making in a simple and easy style ."
3,"Script in book form, nothing more.","Gordon McGill writes a polished novelization, but adds nothing to the already lacking story of an adult Damien poised to rule the world. For die hard Omenites only."
2,A disappointing end to the first two,"Maybe this didn't live up to expectations because of a different author. But the stage was set and somebody had to step up and write the next sequel. Now we find Damien as a powerful adult, following the same tired plot of striking down anybody that stands in his way. There just isn't the gut-wrenching suspense in this effort and I found the whole effort, if you can call it that, disappointing."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"In the novelisation The Final Conflict : Omen 3, Damian is a grown man with a lot of power and influence. He still gets rid of people that stand in the way of the whole antichrist thing.It is also a lot harder to stop an adult man on a rapid rise to the top, compared to a child, but osme people give it a shot."
5,Love it,"Great experience, processed quickly, shipped quickly, no problems what so ever. Would recommend them to others and will use them again."
5,Tried and True,"This book is the pinnacle of Aeneid translators. I used this in AP latin during high school and have recently purchased my own copy to start it up again. The footnotes and appendices are invaluable resources in their helpfulness and explanation of Vergil's poetry and scansion for those not familiar with dactyllic hexameter. The word list in the back is very helpful as well but a latin dictionary is a must since some derivatives of words are hard to translate (not a negative for this book, just a warning). Highly recommended by everyone with whom I've spoken who know of the Aeneid."
2,Comprehensive but poor,"I admire anyone who attempts to teach all of condensed matter physics in one book. That being said, being comprehensive and being comprehendible are two very different things. While being the former it sacrifices the latter. Marder does not do a good job of explaining the physical concepts needed to build a better understanding of advanced material. In addition, his end-of-chapter problems can be relatively uninformative and tedious i.e. you are left asking why did I just do this problem? Inevitably I find myself going back to Ashcroft & Mermin's wonderful but dated book. Hopefully one day they will publish a new edition..."
2,An advanced Graduate level book in Condensed Matter,"I used this book for a Graduate class in Condensed Matter Physics but I didn't get as much as I wanted from the book. The author uses a lot of jargon which you are not supposed to be aware I guess, and also there are a lot of typos or strange terminology which is really frustrating sometimes. He tries to cover everything in Condensed Matter and as a result he does not explain thoroughly the material or the derivations presented. I couldn't only use this book alone to study but instead I was using Marder's book along with Kittel or other books, because this book confuses you so much. The only nice thing about this book is that it covers pretty much everything both in Solid State Physics and in Soft Condensed Mattter but you can find better books I guess."
2,Not Good for Beginner,"I don't like this book, particularly the way it demonstrates mathematical proofs behind physical concepts. I used it as an undergrad, but my graduate classmates did not like it either. Some of the figures are illustrative, however the contents of each chapter are unorganized and confusing. I definitley don't recommend it to beginner of this subject."
4,reveiw,"cd was good but one song was scratched and kept repeating, but hey you get what you pay for.I was'nt upset at all."
1,returned it,This looked more like something you'd hang an ID badge on for work than a piece of jewelery. Mine got returned.
1,Problems with Amazon,"It's disheartening when one orders a product from Amazon, and then finds that the order is cancelled. Seems that Amazon dangles enticing deals and prices as a form of loss-leader to get people to use the site - but this is foolish - it only upsets customers who may begin looking elsewhere for their ecommerce needs."
4,pleasantly surprised,"I bought this disc for the morbid classic, ""St. James Infirmary"" and was pleasantly surprised by a coupla other tracks, mainly ex-Stray Cats Lee Rocker's original, ""Little Buster"" and the Gershwin chestnut, ""Summertime.""Also really liked Hank Williams' ""Mind Your Own Business."" Quite Good!"
5,LP1209 Guiro Jam Block,"I am very pleased with the LP1209 and highly recommend it to both, students and colleagues. It is the largest of the color-coded, jam block series and creates the pitch of an E3 on the piano. It compliments the red jam block, which is tuned to B3. This creates an interval of a fourth, which sounds like the wedding march, ""Here Comes the Bride"". I have been using LP jam blocks for many years and have found their Jenigor plastic formula to be extremely durable and perfect for outdoor use in poor weather conditions. I have never a problem with the mounting brackets, nor the eye-bolt assemblies. The hole of the eye-bolt is 3/8"", which fits most L-brackets and cymbals stands, but not all. ( The traditional Tama L-bracket is one such piece that the eye-bolts will not fit. ) The LP1209 has an added feature of teeth-like grooves, allowing a guiro-like application. The LP1209 is really two percussion instruments in one and is perfect for any Latin or World Music situation."
4,"Sturdy, flexible and very useful","This bag's great, I just wish it was a little bit taller so that it would have more space. But otherwise, it's very light, and has utilities for carrying all sortsa stuff. Also looks pretty good, the design in black has some great styling. Highly recommended for hippies!"
4,I'm waiting..,"This felt like more of a beginner workout and while the levels used for instruction are geared for anybody/fitness level, I thought it was a little pampering. I liked the workout but I would like to have a little variety and more challenges. I guess this is a request to find out when the next workout is going to be released."
5,It Works For Me!,"I am so happy I bought this CD. I will admit, I am one of those who need a little push. This does that in a positive, upbeat way. It is only 30 minutes, and at first I thought ""how am I going to finish 30 minutes right off""? It goes by so quick. I love how it has little challenges throughout the workout to keep it interesting. I wish there were more of them, so I could close my eyes, pick one, and go with it. In addition to simply wanting more of them, I would like to see some longer and more challenging workouts as I progess. I love this CD."
2,Music,"This is okay, kinda disappointing after reading some of the other reviews actually. Music selection is...? I'm not sure who the music is meant to be motivating for. I guess its always subjective.Good concept but to listen to it day after day? Just give me some hot music to pace me."
2,Too cutesy,"The coaching is too cutesy and the tempos don't change enough. If you're gonna have music during a workout, it's much easier to move with the beat. The difference in ""Level 1"" and ""Level 4"" is only about 20 or 25 bpm."
5,Now that was a great workout!,"What a great idea.... Is there anything else like this out there? I realized it was designed for more of a beginner to fitness although, i still got a great workout. Does anybody know if there are more workouts? Great voice...actually felt like Sean was right next to me the whole workout...keeping me from slacking off and the music was pretty good to. Not that techno [stuff] that makes my head spin. I'm ordering a copy for my mom...Maybe she will finally use that treadmill that I got her for her birthday for more than just a blanket holder."
5,Saved for what?,"""Are you saved?"" evangelical Protestants ask. While salvation *from* sin, death, and condemnation is certainly crucial, it is only the beginning of Christian life. What are we saved *for*?Fr. George Maloney gives the ancient Catholic answer: we are saved for deification (divinization, theosis). The Mystery of Christ in You explores Saint Paul's mystical theology of deification. It is a brilliant, readable introduction to the Epistles of Paul, the doctrine of deification, and mystical theology."
2,"Only if you like the BANDS on here, not if you like SLAYER","Only 3 bands can save this ""tribute"". 1)Hypocrisy, 2) Jungle Rot, 3)Dissection. Well, the S.of Heaven songe arent bad, but 2 versions werent needed. Brutal Truth and Mortician are bad in this. But, if you're a fan of the bands that PLAY on this, then you will like this."
4,SSSLLLAAAAAAYYYEEERRRRRR!!!!!!,Bravo to any band that does a cover on Slayer. And I'm not just saying that without listening to the CD. The 4 stars rating proves that. Slayer is a house-hold name. Slayer is GOD. It would have been a better CD if they were covered by more well known bands.
5,"If you like baseball, you will love this story...","I had a hard time putting this book down. Zane Grey has the feel for what it is really like to be a college baseball player, along with all of its struggles and victories. This is a great story with a great ending. You too will enjoy this story about Ken Ward and all of his fellow teammates. In the end, you will be thoroughy satisfied. Great book!"
2,Not a western,"Good read but dated. Grey does much better with western, explaining the scenery and providing in depth explaining of the western experience."
4,Good Read,"An interesting story. Obviously from years ago, but good, nonetheless. This is a well written story which kept my interest to the end."
4,The Young Pitcher,Another good read from Zane Grey. This book would certainly appeal to a young man interested in the sport of collegiate baseball. It is quite interesting in that it takes place shortly after the turn of the century and allows the reader a look at the game and its players from a bygone era.
5,A great guide!,"I have been dreaming of going to Hawaii for years but have never known how to approach it. Thanks to the explorer's guide, I have been able to map out a trip that meets my needs and will allow me to see the important sights (for me) on some of the islands."
1,Ridiculous,"This movie is described as "" funny, and often outright silly"" but it is completely insipid. Don't waste your time or money on this one. It's disappointing because I love David Hasselhoff. This movie is 'WAY beneath his talent!!"
2,Ashida Kim...most people either love him or hate him...,"This book is concerned with the control of one's own mind...something not intuitively obvious from the title. If anyone believes this book will allow you to control peoples minds like Obi-Wan or something, you will be very mistaken! The main content of this book deals with breathing techniques and the kuji-in methods of focusing chi, derived from the buddhist art of Mikkyo. On a purely design note, the pictures tend to be rather blurry, and Kim insists on using chinese throughout the book to supplement the japanese words for the 9 kuji-in.As with all of Kims books (and indeed any book on the subject of Ninjutsu), read them and then decide for yourself what to believe and what to ignore."
3,Highly Interesting Read,"This emphasises on relaxation techniques based on chinese medicine, Ashida Kim's focus is controlling one's mind if one can understand the following statement ""The greatest warrior is the one who can conquer himself"" you understand what I means...thourughly recommend it !"
1,What a joke.,"I bought a copy of this book about two and a half years ago, when I first started studying budo and wanted to read everything I could get my hands on. When I read it I had never encountered anything of the sort, so I really didn't know what to think about it all. I have since encountered real budo through Hatsumi sensei, and I have since Mr. Hunter's book in the garbage, where it rightly belongs."
4,Respect for marshal arts,"Any selfish person who takes marshal arts, to be more powerful than the extreme are weeded out early. Any good marshal artiest knows the best way to win a fight is not to get in one. Any selfish person who reads the title and think about control other poeple minds for ther own selfish needs, desire, or egos. Will not make it in any marshal arts.(Your true colors will shine thought) This book is design to give you mental dexterity. Marshal arts that exercises the mind and sprit are far morevaluable physical sxercises. The proper respect this is needed. You will learn to control your own mind, wants ,needs, and fears. With the proper respect."
1,Just Falls Short,"Not the worst book on the subject that I've read, but close. The book contains little of merit other than to increase ones intrest in the ninja. More concerned with hand movements and breathing techniques than ninja philosophy or art. Compared to the works of others (Hayes, Morris, and Hatsumi) it just falls short of anything usefull or intelligent about ninja. If it's true ninjutsu you're looking for, try one of the mentioned authors."
1,He's a fake,Ashida Kim is an obvious fake trying to cash in by exploiting ninjutsu. It's really THAT obvious
3,"Not bad, but not authentic","This book did have some very good ideas regarding fighting techniques, mostly distractions, and some philosophy.Kim is without a doubt a self made ninjutsu guy. The facts are that he uses very little Japanese,alot of chinese, does know a little fighting skill,and a little stage magic.I read the book as a child, and have used some of the techniques to defend myself while in the Military Police Corp."
3,Briefly states basic finger positions and meditations.,"This book doesn't live up to it's name of mind control.Dealing briefly with hand positions to gain ""power"" alongwith breathing exercises to relax. It also goes into Ninjamoves which leaves room to be explained better. This is abook more on the Ninja than it is on how to BECOME a Ninja.This book also deals very little with Chi power, contraryto the books back cover description. This book need only beread by Ninja fanatics."
1,This book is more funny then anything,"I got this book second hand at a garage sale like 20 years ago. Can anyone take this stuff seriously? I thought it was a bit more like comedy then anything else. I especially liked the ""monkey steals the peach"" move. That was an inside joke for me and my friends for quite some time."
2,Smells like Ninja,"I read this book when I was 14, and a decade later I have a lot of perspective as a martial artist who has used books for self-training. I used to be a big fan of Ashida Kim books until one day I realized that he basically ends each book trying to teach you a ninja-fied version of ""magic."" There are many interesting techniques for training and expanding your awareness of others trying to influence you in this book. For a good price or at the library this is a decent read, but I've read better, such asMind Manipulation: Ancient and Modern Ninja Techniques. I'd give this guy's work a higher rating if not for the fact he tries to teach you the Kuji Kiri, details how to make contact with a familiar spirit (as in a spirit that will guide you and even protect you, like an imaginary friend but more). One may say its just nerdy drivel, and others will say its a demonic toybox. I say either way he tossed his credibility out the window."
2,Probably not worth it,"After buying and reading several of his works, I have yet to be convinced of ""Ashida Kim""'s credentials. I'm very wary of an individual who feels he must don an Asian name to gain credibility in writing about martial arts. Therefore everything he says you must take with a grain of salt.Mr. ""Kim""'s credentials aside, like all of his other books, this book does contain some very good knowledge, if you look hard enough. But overall this book is vague and provides very little for its reader. There are far better books on martial arts and ninjutsu avalible to readers. Pass on this one."
4,The TRUE Jackson,"Excellent history. I cannot understand how ANYONE can hold Jackson in high esteem. Well written documentation, not the glossy ""facts"" found in some Jackson books."
3,Understanding what the true healing is all about...,"This is another Murphy classic. In this book he explains a reader how to understand all those miracles which are credited to Jesus in the New Testament. He brings in his spiritual understanding, by explaining those miracles in the light of spiritual psychology. Then he explains how to apply them into your everyday life. Dr. Murphy takes this all a step further and tells a reader how to master the art of healing. Not just your physical wounds, but also those inner problems that slow down your own progress toward success.Dr. Murphy has written many great books, but this could be a bit better. This is certainly not the book to start with if you have not read other Murphy material. If you are new to Dr. Joseph Murphy, please read ""The Power of Your Subconscious Mind"" and ""Telepsychics"" first. Then proceed to this book and you will understand it better off.Good luck."
2,Review Scams,"After spending alot of time reading the reviews, I looked backed at WHO was supplying the majority of these reviews. BioNeurix. I'm very upset that people who are desperately seeking help are being duped by a company that is just looking to make a buck. Look at who is writing these reviews and you will see what I mean."
2,Honestly....,"I've had this product for a about 2 weeks, I think it helps a little with anxiety, definitely helpful with insomnia. I had to stop taking it during the day because it makes me extremely tired! So unfortunately I can only take this at night, but it really does help me sleep. I gave a 2 star rating because I really hoped it could be something for me to take during the day to help with anxiety of daily tasks and such, however as I said it makes me feel like a zombie, so I was very disappointed with that. It's used as merely a sleep aid for me, not what I had expected."
2,Seredyn,"I didn't notice anything when I took this product. I wouldn't recommend it, but who knows, it could work for someone else."
3,Not that great- for me anyways,"I tried Seredyn for my social anxiety and panic attacks that would occur every time I went out. I will say that it does have a calming effect and is great if you are just stressed out and want to relax. However, when I did go out it made me feel wierd because it would calm me somewhat but yet I was still shaky and full of panic underneath. It also upset my stomach a little bit (which can be a side effect of Valerian and Passion Flower). I think I am better off buying Passion Flower, 5-htp, and Valerian root by themselves to see if maybe it was one specific ingredient in the Seredyn that didn't agree with me. Besides, it is MUCH MUCH cheaper to buy the herbal supplements by themselves (they sell on Amazon for like 3 bucks a bottle). I can't say that Seredyn doesn't do anything, it does. It is just not what I need. If you are just looking for something to help you feel calm or sedated then go for it."
3,Works for mild attacks,While it works well for mild anxiety/panic attacks it doesn't touch the major ones (at least for me). I had a bad attack thinking about a trip required for my job (my first one since getting off of Lexapro due to weight gain)this morning. Took two Seredyn before eating and it didn't touch my attack. I had to work through it at work which made me tired. I took two more five hours later and now I'm sitting here sick to my stomach. Now I have to pray that I don't have any attacks while on this trip. Don't get me wrong while it works for some it didn't work for me. Best of luck!!Tracy
1,really didnt work for me,really didnt work for me.It guess my body got used to it but idk. Dont really see a difference. It used to work but not now i guess
1,Didn't help at all,This is just another one of those placebo's. My wife wanted this and it did not help her even in the slightest.
5,My opinion...,"This product is great in my opinion. I take about 1 or 2 a day and ALMOST all my anxiety is gone... I feel more talkative, less worried about little things, and also more focused and calm in social situations! I feel it helps my adhd also!! I have chosen to continue using this product because I have seen significant results and improvement. The ONE thing I DO NOT like is how it causes slight tiredness and rarely minor headaches... Other than that its a great SUPPLEMENT."
2,Seredyn's Completer Calm,"I only used one bottle of Seredyn. I believe this product may work good for some, but not for all."
2,Another anxiety relief letdown,"No relief for me at all. Did both the maintenance and during a panic attack. I hoped, but no. Tryptophan or 5 HTP are just as effective. It was worth trying."
1,sereydn,"only started today but gave me shakes, more anxiety and more stress so we ll give it few days of trying it."
5,Pretty Good,I've been taking them for a few weeks now and I notice a difference. I am a lot more relaxed its a little pricey but worth it if you struggle with anxiety. Also noticed that it helps with PMS.
4,Has its pros and cons,"I've used Seredyn on an ""as needed basis"" and I can say it definitely calms my body down, although it doesn't necessarily take away all panic or anxiety symptoms. Sometimes when I'm on it, my mind will continue to race or look for a way out but my body feels calm. It's a strange feeling. However, I do believe it HELPS with anxiety and panic attacks. I can't say it completely takes it away, but I can definitely tell that I am a little more relaxed when I take it."
4,I've used it for several years,"I have Grave's Disease, a form of hyperthyroidism, and it works wonders for calming the ""jittery"" feeling, it also eases the heart palpitations common to the disease. Taking with grapefruit juice seems to potentiate the effects of Seredyn somewhat, I've noticed that when I was taking any kind of medications to decrease stomach acidity like Nexium, Seredyn doesn't work very well. As mentioned in another post, it does physically calm the body down."
3,Not worth the money,"I am sure the pills effects will vary from person to person, however, for the price of these, they just don't do enough. I took two of them at first and felt relaxed for about half an hour and the effects went away. The next day I took three of them together and pretty much got the same effect for no more than an hour. I was disapointed and thought these would be good after reading reviews on them. The price is too high for these pills, I am looking for ones that work longer and are cheaper in price."
2,I agree- Doesn't work,"I've only taken this twice, but I have to agree with the other reviewers. I didn't want to say anything negative about this because I thought maybe it was just me, but after seeing these reviews, I now know that the problem is Seredyn just doesn't work. I felt a little calm, but that was it. Certainly not the boost we're all looking for. These natural pills just aren't strong enough, I'm afraid. We'll have to stick to the real drug, and just take on any side effects it brings. I know that's what I'm going to do. I am looking into Paxil and Xanax, as this did nothing for me."
5,Seredyn,I began taking this several months ago for generalized anxiety. I take one at night before bed and it has helped immensely.
2,"Eh, doesn't do anything.","This product, I'm sure works differently for everybody, but it didn't do anything for me. I didn't feel any different, I still get all kinds of anxiety, didn't help me relax or even fall asleep. Nothing. I'd say it's a waste of money but it was worth it for me to try because my anxiety levels are ridiculous. Everybody's body is different but it really didn't change anything for me."
2,Works in Some Situations,"I took Seredyn for panic attacks due to speech anxiety. I found that it didn't really do much. I took it everyday for a few days before my presentation, and it makes you feel a little bit sleepy and dazed. But when it came time for my presentation, I didn't feel any calming effects. So I think it might help with general anxiety, but with specific phobias, I don't think it really does much. Every person is different though."
1,Made me feel depressed,It made me really sleepy and numb. Also made me really depressed. I wont use them any more. Maybe they don't work for me!
2,Snake Oil,it did nothing for me I need drugs that work one that doesn't make me sick or turn my eyes red
3,very good,I thought this was a charming story about a very talented boy... it definitely explores the human side of being so gifted. Foster as always is quite good. I particularly liked the scene where the kid reads the bottom of the plate...
5,Little Man Tate,This is the very best Jodie Foster effort....I Loved this movie...It's one you can watch over and over.
4,Little Man Tate,"Little Man Tate is an excellent movie with first class acting and direction (Jodie Foster, Dir.). This is a movie the entire family can enjoy. It will expand your awareness of people around you, and stimulate discussion and appreciation of the gifts each person has, even if there are no geniuses in your family. It is a thoroughly engaging, heart-tugging, and often very funny movie."
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...],"There's something so amazing, but also so sad about this movie. This film really showed you how much someone with a special gift has to give up, just to remain special. The story was great, but as a movie it was choppy and jumped around a lot leaving many things unfinished. Entertaining and worth watching? Yes. One of the best films Ive seen? No."
3,Little Man Tate,"This was an interesting movie. It isn't a ""feel good"" movie, but caused me to ponder. Glad I saw it."
2,I liked it up to a point,"My wife and I felt the same about this film - it was good up to a point. The main weakness of the film is that the characters are 2-dimensional, and without giving away any plot details, we found itdefinitely too ""feel good."" At the end of the film, we agreed: ""only 2 stars for this one."" Rent it before you buy it. (We saw it on TV, luckily.)"
3,Not that good.,"Any director worth his or her "" salt "" would have taken advantage of all the missed opportunities in this movie. First, the characters are merely two dimensional and portray little to no genuine human emotion. The character developments in this film are really poor. Things just move too fast in this movie and from the beginning to end it feels lost amid a sea of turmoil with no light-house close by. I wish more would have been acknowledged about the "" mentors "" lonliness and her coming to grips with her inner pain, of which we see little of. Also the mother, Jodie Foster, seems to be acting by "" numbers "". This was one of her worst roles both in acting and script. There wasn't enough dynamics in the movie. Really a sloppy movie."
3,Controversial,"Many criticize carelessness in this guide, prepared toward the end of the author's life."
3,"Good basic homebrew kit, reasonably priced.","For beginners. This kit makes a good gift for anyone who loves beer. Everything you need to brew a 2 gallon batch of pale ale, plus instructions. Also comes with catalogs and order forms for all sorts of other flavors of beer refills and equipment."
4,Great Gift Idea,"I bought this for my boyfriend as a father's day gift, and he LOVED it. The only problem I see with it, it doesn't have bottles in this package. Bottles are necessary for the last step in fermentation. But you don't actually need to buy the bottles, you could always save some pop bottles instead. I ended up ordering the glass bottles from the MR Beer website.I would also say that the easy steps are pretty easy, but there are a lot of things to do in those steps...anyways. Its a great product and a fun one too. A great gift for any beer lover."
5,Pretty good system,"It works. It is easy. But it is not as cheap as beer on sale at the grocery. Biggest gripe: the spigot stinks. Get a better one and widen the hole if necessary. I like Homebrewit.com for parts and HME. I tried a Belgian Abbey Ale they sell from ""Brewferm"". It makes 9 liters and still fits in the Mr. Beer fermentor. I didn't cool it enough before adding yeast, and it bubbled out the top, but I cleaned it and put the top back on and it turned out great."
1,missing parts,i bought this item as a girt for my father . it was missing the yeast and other ingredients to make the beer he has yet to be able to use it . I'm really sad because i have ordered alot and never had an issue with anythingMr. Beer Deluxe Edition Home Microbrewery System
1,"Its worthless,cheaply made, trash","Dont waste your money on this junk.Got mine and it was ready for trash before my first batch was even made.Warnigs on water temperature, for sterilization should be more noticeable.If you use to of hot of water for steriling equipment ,it will ruin it.Very cheaply made"
3,Not a complete product...,"This is my 3rd Mr. Beer kit, but the first of this caliber that I had received as a gift on Christmas. That being said, I was a bit confused by why they would sell this kit.Sure, it comes with the keg and a mix, but that's only enough to finish half of the process! After you ferment the beer, where are you supposed to put it if you don't have bottles?! And as far as I can tell, it doesn't even come with the shown bottle caps, but not like they would help.I can't say much for the beer that's included, because it's not done brewing, but as mentioned, I love the Mr. Beer line as a simple hobbyist way of making beer.If you want to experiment with Mr. Beer, then do yourself a favor and get the Mr. Beer Premium Gold for $15 more to get bottles and 2 beer kits instead of one. You won't regret it."
2,Do not buy this.,This is possibly one of the cheapest things I have ever seen. First of the keg is such that it is near impossible to pour your hot wort into it without it spilling all over the sides and becoming a sticky mess. The spout on the front of mine was so bad that I had to take it apart to get it to stop from pouring water straight out of the keg. Even after it had been fixed I had to place the spout in upside-down. This still did not prevent leakage I went from about 8.5 liters of wort to somewhere are 5 liters when the beer had been done fermenting. Had I known that this thing would have been a piece of garbage I would have never bought it in the first place.
2,Doesn't come with everything you need,"Despite advertising ""everything you need to make beer in 14 days"" this kit does not come with bottles. Imagine my husband opening it on Christmas Day to discover he couldn't use it just yet. Anyway, buyer beware."
2,Poor Taste,"I've brewed two batches now with my Mr. Beer keg and both have turned out tasting inadequate. Both batches had nice color, minimal carbonation, good alcohol content, and a decent aroma, but were lacking in taste. It's kind of hard to describe, but it is as though the byproducts of the fermentation are too powerful in the final product. I agree with someone else who said that a two-stage home brew kit would probably do better. I will not be brewing any more with this kit. I like the idea though."
4,The kit is good but beer is ok,The kit works very good it is simple but the beer that it comes with is ok but not great. I would order the refill packs from Mr. beer itself because the refill packs here just don't cut it. There is not to choose from here on Amazon.
5,"Great product, GREAT BEER!!!","Got to the States from Africa and started the process 3 weeks ago. Yesterday opened my first bottle and it is AMAZING!!! I started with the Oktoberfest and it does taste so good. I added one tbs of brown sugar to the wort as suggested on a review and it is just awesome!The process is simple, the wait is not bad, the amount is perfect and the result is cheaper than buying in the store.As soon as I bottled the first batch, I started the second one with an American Classic Ale. Nothing is better than coming home after playing a soccer game and open a bottle of cold and delicious home made beer.Highly recommended... after trying, you will never go back to the store to buy beer! Will bring a kit with me to Africa!"
3,Pretty good,"This product is pretty good. A few of the beers didnt really turn out that well but I think it may have been the way my boyfriend capped the bottles. Having said that, the beer that did turn out, was really good! It is a really fun activity for a father and son. My boyfriend and his dad worked on this together."
4,A great gift!,This was a birthday gift for my husband and he has had so much fun with it that he has ordered all different types of brew options to try!
5,great easy to use product,"my husband is now the beer meister because of this beer machine, you can simply not make a bad batch of beer- the customer service to buy the Mr. Beer mixes is supurb- we however did not order the complete system with the plastic bottle we found a site on-line where we ordered glass bottles-they will last longer and they look great. Highly recommend this product- we also purchased a different type of beer machine and have been completely disapointed. This is the one for you we promise. Cheers"
1,Buy a home brew system instead.,"I tried the Mr. Beer homebrew system and was very disapointed. It was fun to make the beer, but the end product left a lot to be desired, why brew beer in this that you can barely tolerate when you can spend a bit more and get a brewing system that makes good beer.Learn a lesson from me and go to you local home brew store and brew your own."
1,Not worth it,"My father recieved one of these for Christmas, and we were rather disappointed. The ingredients were low quality, and the equipment akward to use. You're better off going to your local homebrew store, getting a 6-gal plastic bucket with an airlock, and a siphon. Also the book ""How to Brew: Ingredients, Methods, Recipes, and Equipment for Brewing Beer at Home"" by John J. Palmer. There are pleanty of good recipies, using dry or liquid malt extracts and dried hops, which are as easy to make as the Mr. Beer kits, and much, much tastier."
1,Stop! Read This!,"People! Please stop being mislead into wasting your money and time on this obvious gimmick! I've been brewing GOOD beer for over 20 years and can tell you that Mr. Beer is a marketing toy, not a real brewing kit. It takes serious shortcuts to sound brewing practices, shortcuts that make it very unlikely you can make drinkable beer with it. I personally have met at least a dozen owners of this toy and only one has indicated he made a drinkable beer with it...after 10 failures. Do yourself a favor and contact a local homebrew supplies store and purchase a real brewing kit from folks who know how to make good beer. While the initial investment may appear higher, at least you won't end up pouring out 9 out of 10 batches of beer. And making great beer with a real brewing kit and ingredients, is quite easy. Mr. Beer gives craft beer a bad name...please don't continue to support this gimmick!"
3,"Great song, but the remixes suck!","""The power of goodbye"" is one of the best songs Madonna has ever recorded. And one that received the WORST mixes ever!I really have no idea where Madonna was, when her recording company decided to release it as a single, maxi single etc.I bought few years ago the european maxi with 4 versions and after few weeks I got rid of it. I couldn't listen to it.This one has only three tracks, but at least keep the beauty of the original song. They cut the remixes to only one (thank God!) and this is Dallas Austin mix. Of all mixes I have heard, it's the closest to the basic version, without stupid effects and all the tricks which could make it sound ridiculous.In my opinion the remixes did only wrong to the song and its chart performance. If you are not her die-for-fan, skip it and buy the ""Ray of light"" cd."
5,Pamela Williams - Smooth Jazz Personified,"Living in the midwest (Oklahoma), you have to do a bit of work to find out what's new and exciting in the smooth jazz genre. I rely on our digital cable provider's music channel and input from friends who live in large metropolitan areas in other parts of the country. I had heard of Pamela Williams but hadn't actually heard any of her music. While shopping on-line, her music kept popping up on ""what other customers bought"" who made the same muscial purchases that I had.I decided to get her most recent CD, ""Elixir"", after reading a review by a customer here on Amazon.com. It sounded like this was a CD I had to have and the reviewer was right. I love this CD! It's got a great blend of up-tempo tracks along with some slow-grooves to cuddle to or just relax by. I found every track to be a ""keeper"". I am a new fan and will remain a loyal one. Can't wait for the next release from ""The Saxtress""."
5,Elixir- WOW,"After hearing the song ""Afterglow"" on Pandora.com, I knew I had to hear more of this amazing talent that is Pamela Williams. I have purchased this CD (and The Perfect Love, which Afterglow is on, pick that one up as well) and I was simply amazed. No song sounds like the other songs on here, and the composing of the beat and sax blend perfectly. My only complaint is the CD is too short, but this is a CD to put on while relaxing around the house, driving down a coastal highway with the top down, or whenever!I now have two CD's by this amazing, funky saxtress and the name saxtress is definitely well deserved. Pick this CD up if you are a fan of good, soulful smooth jazz.Top 3 Songs:RejuvinationPositive VibeGive Me What You Got"
2,You get what you pay for,I received this product and returned it the next day. Don't be fooled by the pretty picture. The actual product looks like something put together as a science project. Save yourself the trouble.
5,Comfy for summer,"This is the first pair of Naot I have bought since my summer in Israel in 1997, and I am reminded of why I love Naot! They are very comfortable, far more so than Birkenstocks. I have very high arches, and as a result I need a lot of arch support in a shoe. These Naot have that support, and enough of a heel that I don't feel like I am barefoot. Because there is a velcro closure on the shoe, you get a perfect, snug fit while still enjoying the convenience of a slip-on shoe (which is so nice to have in the summer).I used a bit of clear rubber cement to reinforce the cork sides of my last pair of Naot, and they lasted for years. My guess is these will too."
2,Not Spiral Bound As In Photo,"I purchased this book before. The copies I purchased were spiral bound and could be laid flat for reading and recording. I ordered three from this seller thinking I was getting the same. Regardless of picture, they are NOT spiral bound. These close up due to the cloth binding,. Makes it harder to record and read. I will probably take a shot at returning them. By the way, the 5 star reviewer here even mentions that he is reviewing the spiral bound book.. Amazon dot com, if you kick this review back to me again, I would like you to specify what is wrong with my review."
3,Good transaction..merchandise less than described.,The transaction was good. The book pages are pretty brittle. I will be the last person to read it as it destroys itself as I turn the pages. The item description was a little bit optimistic but the price was right.
2,Do not buy Critic's Choice - Poor quality,"Do not buy Critic's Choice Sherlock Holmes DVD's as the one above. I purchased this one and others and am sorry I did. They are poor quality, shakey blurry, and faded. I purchased MPI Double Feature Sherlock Holmes and am very happy. MPI are very clear, not shaky, and you will not be sorry. I don't know why the person above is recommending Critic's Choice unless he is the seller?I am now looking for MPI replacements, so I can get rid of my Critic's Choice. Unless you have no choice and need the episode, then do it, but I recommend to wait and get MPI. Good Luck!!!!"
3,Cute,"I thought Flyboy... was a pretty decent read. Both of the main characters are compelling and unique and the plot is original. I'd say the only real fault with the book is the way that the main character keeps lapsing into lame, cheezy emotionality; the relationship described, while believable, is drawn out childishly, and the descriptions of sexual situations seem too naive to take seriously. Maybe that's the point. It's no Dostoyevsky, but it's a cute book and is entertaining."
4,Couldn't put it down.,"This was a really cool book. Read it in 2 days. I loved the stylish underground nature and the attention to detail. I really liked Munroe's writing style (the chapter transitions for instance) and his attention to detail, it's a must when you're a fan of Sailor Moon and the punk/activist culture. I know the descriptions make this book sound like a sci-fi novel, but it dosn't seem that way one bit. A great read."
1,songs of zion accompanist,"Songs of Zion Accompanist Edition is a Good book to have in your library. It may not have some of the latest songs as does Zion Generation book which was printed later, But it has many classic standards that are always needed. Also this particular edition of Zion has the spiral for Accompalists which makes the pages easy to turn without leaving creases in your book."
4,"diamond dogs, turquoise days","i have enjoyed all of mr.reynolds books. the story lines are thoroughly enjoyable. i only wish to point out that in ""diamond dogs"", chapter 3, pg. 41, he lists the first few prime numbers as one, three, five, seven. One is not a prime. the first prime is two."
2,Disappointing after reading Pushing Ice,"After reading Pushing Ice, the much shorter Diamond Dogs was a tad disappointing. It lacked depth and character development. A bunch of people head out to explore an alien spire full of puzzles. Get it right, you move on to the next room. Get it wrong, you get sliced and diced. Frankly, its as if Reynolds watched ""The Cube"", and decided to write his own version. The lack of a solid resolution left this story as an empty copy of another idea. Since we never learn anything about the Spire or the aliens who created it, there's nothing original to get lost in and the final ""twist"" is lackluster. I'd pass on this one."
4,"Good, but too short, novellas","Both novellas in this book are quite good, but both feel like they would have benefited from an extra 50 pages or so... their endings feel a little rushed. However, they're still quite enjoyable to read and if you are craving more stories set in the Revelation Space universe, this fits the bill."
3,A must for the Reynolds fan but not for the collector.,"I hate collecting books in the mass market paperback format, so these Gollancz editions are a real boon to me. Other reviewers have amply reviewed the contents - I wanted to point out that the publisher appears to have used Spell-Checker instead of a human proofreader for this edition. If this kind of defect affects your enjoyment of the material then try for another edition."
5,Not Free SF Reader,"Two excellent novella style works, here. The first is about an alien artifact that is a complicates of series of mathematical puzzles that get harder as they go on, and the desperate lengths people will go to to try and understand it.The second is about two sisters and their relationship with the biology of the strange ocean on their planet, as well as the unstable political situation they live in.Fine work.Mathematics requires surgical precision.5 out of 5I sea we have a problem.3.5 out of 5"
1,Wrong product description!,"I bought this item because it said it was PINE SCENT, that is what I was looking for, but it is actually horrible bubble gum scent. NOT pine scent!Zero stars!"
5,"GREAT - Now do an update, Andres!","I read this book before visiting Cuba some years ago and it made the trip SO much more interesting. I found myself looking for the ONLY sign of protest: the 8A graffiti around Habana. Now that Raul is in power it would be wonderful to reevaluate the island's politics and culture, just as updating Bordering on Chaos would explain a lot about what is happening in Mexico with a new PANista leader's intense and violent confrontation with the drug cartels."
3,"Interesting on certain accounts, but ....","...compared with ""Bordering on Chaos"", this book makes me question Oppenheimer a bit. And, there has yet to be Castro's ""final hour"" eight years after this book has been published. But I did enjoy the in depth reading of certain events he covers, and I think it must be pretty difficult to write such an intensive work on such a controversial subject. I look forward to more good readings on Cuba."
1,Some people would love to have Batista still in power,"Just four words: ""FANATICAL HATRED OF FIDEL"".Yes, there are A LOT of things to criticize about the communist government in the island. However, when one looks at the landscape left by center-right governments in the rest of Central America... the corruption, the iliteracy, the ""open markets without any local development"" policies that destroyed industries from Dominican Republic to Haiti, Cuba by comparison can be criticized only on ""lack of freedom of speech"", on all other accounts, they win by knock-out on all the important counts specially health care and education.That such a small island was able to survive decades of economic sanctions and blockade, it's something to admire.People like Andres Oppenheimer would love to have Batista still in power, applying his ""open wide markets"" doctrine, that left the rest of central america empoverished."
4,Prints Great,"I would recommended this printer because it prints very fast and prints on all types of paper. I have had no complaints with printer so far. We bought it to use in our church office, networked to four computers."
4,An Eye Opening and Historical Look at Jewish Persicution.,"I read this book while taking a semester of school in Jersalem. I had always known about the holocaust, but never did I understand the lies and fabrications that accompanied and fueled that hate. This book exposes the deception and lies that caused the people of Europe, and Eastern Europe to foster what really amounts to fear that manifested itself in hate acts. The author documents his claims well, and dose a good job avoiding emotional baggage. The work is well written, well documented, and a well argued book. I would recommend it to anyone for its educational value. You will never think of the holocaust the same again. E-Mail me and we'll talk about it. -Santa Clarita,Ca"
3,SAP book on performance tuning and testing,I didn't find the book as expected while purchasing. It is more of a high level overview and doesn't get into details on the subject.ThanksSB
2,not a prize,"Deanna's Ashford Savage Surrender was erotic, intriguing, and kept you wanting more. I found that book very pleasurable to read and have been looking for a similar one. I was hoping to find it here, in this book and was mistaken. The storyline is too drenced with sexual interactions (don't get me wrong, i like drenched, but geez) and there was nothign out of the ordinary....nothing done that you would be like ""WOW!!"" After reading a chapter or two, i skimmed through the rest, barely. It doesn't seem like the author who wrote Savage Surrender penned this book."
1,Not really very sexy,"Now and then I enjoy a good erotic novel, especially one with an historical setting. This one was unfortunately a dud - being neither particularly erotic nor a very good story."
3,What's that in your eye?,"The eye balls are great to look at but the taste really isn't all that good. Not bad; Not good! Still,. . . Cool!"
3,The novel's concept is flawed,"While I am a Mina fan, ""Deception"" is very much flawed in concept. The focus on the mystery occurs relatively late in the book, when Lachlan becomes less passive and discovers and follows leads. The ultimate explanation is bizarre, requiring an unbelievable character.At the same time, I would have appreciated a better understanding of how Lachlan came to lead the life he did after successfully completing a medical degree. Lachlan's brief explanations are too pat, his introspections unsatisfying. Perhaps more insight into Susie's point of view could have made her a more compelling, multi-dimensional character."
4,Enjoyable mystery,"This is a ""crime"" mystery written as a diary by a husband whose wife has been convicted of a murder. The story seems unfathonable and the reader become engrossed in trying to figure what is going on. Mina is a good writer and bring the tale to a close that ties up all the loose ends very nicely. Slightly tongue in cheek, I think -- but fun to read."
3,Well written but uninspiring,"The plot of this novel was interesting, and certainly presented a few surprises, although on the whole, it was predictable. I loved the narrative style, and found that Mina was extremely effective at creating the main character's psyche."
2,Did She Check Out the Stories?,"I thought this was a good concept for a Vietnam experience book - about 20 oral interviews with women of various Vietnam backgrounds. However, I couldn't get through it. As anyone familiar with Stolen Valor by B. G. Burkett knows, there's an awful lot of lies out there which are represented as true Vietnam experiences. I got to the story from the lady who said it most disturbed her that ""her general"" and six other generals and aides were killed in her area. I think the history shows that only one general in total was killed in Vietnam. So, I don't believe the author/editor did any fact checking and I don't believe she had much of a knowledge base. In another story she referred to a ""gunny"" sergeant as a ""gunship"" sergeant (although she got it right in a later story).All in all I thought this was a pretty weak effort. The concept is still good, it just needs to be better handled."
5,great,"this item had prompt service. it was a great deal, i couldn't pass up.not to mention, fast delivery."
2,"Good start, not enough material","Having purchased a number of Study Bibles over the years, I looked forward to adding one more to my set. However, this Bible hardly qualifies as a Study Bible. It does provide a very good introduction to one method for personal Bible Study - it then uses Genesis as a way to apply that methodology. But that is all.I expect a Study Bible to offer helps throughout the scriptures - this Bible only focuses on one book. A look at this edition's home page, makes it clear that it was developed to support William Proctor's seminars. I expect that it does this well, but it falls short of being a general Study Bible. If additional resources were available on-line, it would add some value to this edition. If additional resources were available for purchase, it might be of addition value. Neither of these are available.If you are looking for a general Study Bible, I would recommend looking further."
2,Not even close to being a classic,"The latest Niven book 'The Burning City' looked interesting, and having heard that 'Magic..' was a prequel-of-sorts, I decided to read it first.This was my first experience with Niven and if it's representative of his body-of-work as a whole, I can see why he regularly collaborates with others...he's not very talented with the written word.Most of this book was stilted throughout. Topping that off, it's just not horribly interesting. Perhaps we can give Niven a little credit for being one of the forerunners of the modern fantasy boom, but calling this book a classic isn't something I'll ever do.The fact that other reviewers have remarked on its similarities to a popular children's fantasy game speaks volumes."
2,Falls apart during usage,"The pepper grinding course/fine adjustment screw never stays in position and the entire top of the pepper mill falls off during use. Surprisingly, the pepper mill comes only one-third filled with peppercorns. The satin finish absorbs oil from your hands and feels greasy after a short time. Even worse, after a short time the mating surface between the removable top half and the base gets a coating of fine pepper and when the top is turned, the pepper mill emits a load squeal.I am very unsatisfied with this product.The salt mill, too, does not come completely filled with coarse sea salt and the grinding adjustment screw never holds firmly in place."
4,Peugeot Paris Salt and Pepper Mill,Peugeot is the only brand of salt an pepper mills that I would consider purchasing for personal use or as a gift. The only improvement that I would like to see is to be able to purchase new hardware (grinding heads) as they do eventually wear out.
5,Kidde Combo Carbn Monoxide/Smoke Alarm,"This is a great buy for a combination unit. If your house is already wired for an AC smoke alarm this unit is a breeze to install. I replaced two older smoke alarm only units in my house that was already wired for AC smoke alarms & the existing wiring works fine for the combination unit & the battery backup is a big plus (in case of power outage) that my old units did not have. If your house is not already wired for AC units then I would recommend a battery unit only because wiring an existing house for these would be to complex & expensive to wire. I am very pleased with these units & Amazon's price was the best deal I found. I have made many purchases from Amazon & their delivery & service is the best as far as I'm concerned. Keep up the great service Amazon!!!, Yours is my favorite online place to shop & I look forward to doing business with you in the future.Sincerely,Robert Joyner"
5,Solid product!,So far so good. Hopefully it never goes off but you never know. Previous one expired after 7 years so this a great replacement/upgrade. I would highly recommend as it was easy to intstall with existing wiring and is solidly built.
2,Hush mode?,"""Hush mode"" has never worked on this device. If I try to brown dinner (it doesn't even have to get overcooked, just browning is sufficient), it starts yelling that a fire is occurring even though no smoke is visible, I have the kitchen window open, and am running the house fan, a box fan, and the stove vent. So I'll activate hush mode. ""Hush mode activated!"" the alarm chirps, and we all sigh in relief ... for 2 minutes before the alarms starts shrieking again. Repeat. Last time it got so bad my husband attacked it with a broom. It gets two stars for still working after the broom attack despite the serious cosmetic damage."
1,Defective after 6 mos,"and of course, I can't return it to amazon.com! Item beeps every 25-30 seconds even after installing 2 new 9-volt batteries"
5,easy instal & reliable,easy install & much needed upgrade! Bought a 20 year old condo and the wiring was still a 3 minute project... a good investment for your family's safety
2,"False alarms with ""dirty"" electricity","We've got two of these and are sending them both back due to false alarms. They seem to be related to electrical noise on the line because one of them reliably goes off when we use our induction cooktop and both go off intermittently usually around mid-day when our PV system is at maximum output. No problems with the 6 Kidde PI2010 dual smoke alarms or the HD135F heat alarm on the same circuit (other than the fact that it's deafening throughout the house when all 9 detectors sound off at the same time!), so it isn't a Kidde power supply problem, just something specific to these units.Other than that, they look and work well, and the voice feature is a useful feature since it enables you to distinguish the type of alarm. They should make the red light on these things brighter, though: figuring out which alarm initiated requires running around the house and standing directly underneath each alarm to see if it's the one with the red light."
1,"Do not buy, beeps for new battery after just 1 month","I should have heeded the warnings by other reviewers that some of these units constantly beep for new batteries after only a short time. I bought one and it worked fine so I bought several more. About 1 month ago the old unit started beeping for a new battery.Thinking the battery that came with the unit was drained to begin with, I used a battery tester to ensure a replacement battery contained a good charge and inserted it into the unit. Approximately one month later, the device is beeping again. I am sending the several I had received after the replacing the battery one month prior, back to Amazon with the reason being that Amazon should not sell these.I may contact Kidde, though I really do not want to risk installing another defective unit that possibly won't even detect CO or smoke."
4,smoke alarm,This item is an exact replacement for what we had. It has a built-in life span so it has to be replaced in a certain number of years. It starts beeping for no apparent reason when it is time to replace it. We had it for at least seven years with no problems. It has a good sensitivity level.
1,Poor product...don't waste your money,"After the 1st week, the alarm would constantly beep every 15 seconds. I thought it was a defective battery, so I changed the battery out with a new one. Then one month later, the beeping came back ;( This is the worst smoke alarm I've ever seen. Its only brought me headaches instead of reliability. I'm going to chuck this one out and replace it with a cheap, non-voice warning smoke alarm."
1,If only I could give ZERO stars,"Constant false alarms in the middle of the day. And then when one presses the ""Hush"" feature it runs through a variety of smoke and carbon monoxide alarm demos before it shuts up. Then, the other night at 2:45 am I get ""SCREEEECH SCREECCH LOW BATTERY!!!! LOW BATTERY!!!"" and it would not quiet and even after tearing the POS out of the wall it still would not shut up, so I had to wrap it in a towel and stick it in the fridge to get some sleep. I called their customer service and got an obnoxiously rude woman named ""Heather"" who was little to no help. Something that is supposed to save lives should not be so faulty."
2,double edged sword,"I purchased a home where the previous owner installed these everywhere. I do like that in the event of a fire that you have a professional style system, like you would have in a school, that all alarms go off and flash at the same time. However, like another reviewer stated, it's a nightmare when it happens for no reason.About a year ago our carbon/smoke detector started to fail and alarmed randomly, especially at night. It was hard to find what unit was going off, which is the worst part of this design. In theory if something is wrong, the unit is supposed to beep frequently, like 2 times a minute. However, when these things malfunction, the beep goes off at random times (could be ten minutes, thirty minutes, five hours apart) and its very hard to locate where it came from since their are several units in the house. The only way to stop them from alarming is by disconnecting them and pulling the battery, which is really dangerous, as you now have no alarm."
5,GREAT BUY !!!,IT IS EXACTLY WHAT IT SUPPOSED TO BE!VERRY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT - CONNECTED 2 IN LINE - THEY TRIGGER TOGETHER IN CASE OF TROUBLE!IT WORKS AS DESIGNED.NO PROBLEMS
1,Terrible,We have had the alarm for less than 2 years. It gives a false fire alarm constantly.I just threw it out. Do not purchase this product.
4,I purchased several,"of these for my townhouse and had my friend purchase them for hers. They are great and loud when they go off yelling ""Fire, Fire!"". When they go off because of cooking fumes by grandson lines everyone up in the garage to leave the premises!"
4,it works,"this hardwire smoke/Carbon monoxide detector works fine, one must check compatibility with exiting detector, if you have older detector you will end up changing plate that sits against wall surface, I was hoping to use my old one, so it would be that much less work. battery compartment could have been design better."
5,reliable durable easy to install,Have a total of 3 of this model Kidde CM/Smoke Alarm very reliable durable product. Best price found with free shipping. Doesn't get much better.
2,Decent detector with culprits,"These are decent detectors, however not without problems. They do require to be hard wired to AC to operate and left running on battery alone will exhaust it within days and sound ""low battery"" alarm. Therefore leaving a house for vacation and shutting down all power is not an option.Secondly, as others mentioned, they do sound a false alarm once in a while due to power fluctuations. Indeed, this usually happens at night, the most unfortunate timing.And thirdly, although by design, the volume of the alarm is absolutely deafening, so much so that approaching the detector to turn it off in the middle of the night is a self-inflicted torture. Perhaps great for hearing impaired but not recommended for folks with good ears.But most importantly, like other ionizing smoke detectors, this devices will fail to alarm you during a slow burning smoldering fire (such as smoking upholstered furniture) until it is too late (see NBC Nightly News on 3 Oct 2012)."
3,"Good, but read warning!","Hi,Installation was pretty basic. I used a 3+G wire to interconnect the detectors, same wire as if installing a ceiling fan/light.I then connected the the 2 hot leads to an appropriate circuit.WARNING!!!I used the same power circuit as my bedroom ceiling lights. Everything was fine for 6 months.Summer causes ceiling fan usage. Apparently the dimmer switch will trigger off a false alarm.To be more specific, I have an off-low-medium-high dimmer, and when adjusting from high->low->Medium, or low->high->medium will trigger off a false alarm. One of those will trigger off the carbon-monoxide, the other will just be the smoke alarm.Not sure why; they have an extra wire meant for communication."
2,Giving False alarms!,"We have 6 installed in our small 3 bdrm ranch. The past 2 mornings we've had false alarms - ""FIRE FIRE"". The neighbor has had the same problem with same alarms installed by same company. The one in the attic is going off in hot weather. We had the Fire Dept here after first alarm went off 7AM to find nothing. When the attic one went off again at 4:30AM, we just disconnected it. These alarms have only been installed for 8 months. We are having heat wave, but heat should not set off a smoke detector/CO alarm."
2,Combo Smoke and CD Detector,I replaced identical detectors which were installed in my house when it was built in 2005 with these units about a month ago. The CD portion of the original units failed and were constantly giving false alarms. These woke me up one morning about 2 months after I installed them by saying carbon monoxide alert in a very loud and irritating voice. I took them down and pulled out the batteries for an hour or so and they seemed to reset. I installed them again and they seem to be OK for the last week or so. Not very confidence inspiring.
4,Easy and Effecient,"Install of the detector was easy and the product is great. Voice alert tells you what kind of alert (either smoke or carbon monoxide). White color blends nicely with the ceiling. My only negative is that you have to twist the detector off of its holder an unplug the wires, in order to replace the battery."
2,Problem with low battery,I purchased 5 of these alarms to rplace the old alarms in my house. After only 6 months 2 of the alarms started beeping and announcing a low battery. That shouldn't have happened so soon but I replaced the batterys and they lasted only a couple of months the second time. There is obviously something wrong with these alarms. I guess I'm happy that 3 of the alarms still seem to be working correctly.
2,False alarms scared my family~,"For no apparent reason, alarm started to go off with the sound, ""Fire Fire"" at 3 in the morning. I would replace them with more expensive units if I am given a chance. Alarm going off at 3 in the morning really got us scared, not to mention waking everyone in the town house units..."
5,Satisfied the Inspector.,This was a required purchase. Recently remodeled and we were required to install this product and it satisfied the inspector.
4,Replacement unit for the exact same one.,"I really like this detector. I wasn't so impressed with the fact that my old one crapped out in less that 6 years.Ok, install is a snap! very easy, maybe 5 minutes tops.Alarm beeps are loud, very loud. The voice itself not so much.So the alarm sounds at 85db, but the voice that yells fire! fire! is only 50db.The test/hush button is nice, I've never had to hush the unit, but I did test it regularly.The link-ability is very nice, if you have more than 1 level you can use the red wire to link them all together. So if there is smoke in the basement, then the 1st and 2nd level alarms will all go off, and visa versa.The voice feature is very nice, not really necessary, but come on, it is pretty cool!Overall I recommend this unit, I was disappointed in the fact that it only lasted 6 years, but hey...what are ya going to do?"
1,frustrating,"This thing drives me crazy. It keeps saying Low Battery even though I have put 2 separate new batteries, fresh out of the box, into the thing. I've tried repositioning the batteries and making every other change I can think of, to no avail. Each time it makes me go through the whole earsplitting ""test"" process, then, a minute or so after I've finally come down from the step ladder, again tells me ""Low Battery"". This is after it woke the whole family up in the middle of the night with the lovely ""Low Battery"" voice and beeping. How annoying!"
5,Easy to install.,Easy to install. No problems with the alarm(s) after 3 months of use. Having both smoke and CO2 detector together is a must for all homes.
1,Does not qualify for State of Massachusetts Fire Code,"After purchasing 3 of these devices before selling house, I learned that they are unacceptable in the State of Massachusetts for the inspection. The Fire Chief in my town explained that only ""photoelectric"" type devices (First Alert or BRK) will qualify. See [...] for more information. I would check your local fire code (call your fire department) before spending money on the Kidde device. Unfortunately, we did not realize this and are now stuck with these devices.After further research, I realized that this device states in its information brochure (which is NOT on their website description) that ""it should not be installed within 3 feet of the door to a kitchen, door to a bathroom containing a shower, air supply duct use for heating ..."" In our house that is basically where all the original hardwired smoke detectors are located when they were originally installed. (We were trying to upgrade them)"
1,So far it is giving us the dreaded low battery warning!,"We will try calling the company, but my husband just installed this and after about 12 hours it says low battery. Put in another battery and another 12 hours later it says low battery... and the batteries still work in another appliance!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If there is another error and all this thing can say is ""Low Battery"" instead of what is actually wrong, then it is going back as soon as I can figure out how to return the item!!!"
5,Easy Safety,Before this I did not know that these alarms had a specific lifetime. This one was easy to wire and there was a place to write a date so I (or someone else) will know when to replace it in 7 years.
4,Smoke Alarm/Carbon Mono Alarm,I bought this as a replacement item and it met my expitations. It was simple to install and had more than adequate adapters to make the installation easy.
2,DOA,These were to replace the ones in my house as there is something in them that chirps after 7 years of service. The ones from Amazon did not interconnect. It set off a fire alarm when interconnected. I called Kidde and they replaced them for free including shipping. The new ones worked flawlessly
2,"Whooa! Easy Install, Replaced Central Fire Sys Sensors - but does it work?","Quick shipment, replaced 7 sensors which were smoke alarms only (past expiration). Even with need to use wire connectors (sold separately, old system contacts different), each one took about ten minutes going slowly. Impressed when tested - all systems kicked in. No false alarms now after 6 weeks. Good saftety investment for the family. System install capable of novice handy person.UPDATE: 2 months later. Son just learned how to use the microwave (NOT!) - lots of smoke, but alarms never went off. Previously ""tested out fine"", no piece of mind. Will ask Fire Depart to check."
4,Monoxide Smoke Alarm,Product was straight-forward hard wire install. 1 black 1 while 1 green. The complaint I get from my tentants to date is the smoke alarm is to sensitive. Goes off when they cook something in their oven.
3,smoke alarm,"I bought a set of these smoke/co and smoke only detectors 7 years ago. They were much more expensive then, maybe because I bought them from electrician's store.The combination detectors worked and did not have unexplained alarms. The voice low battery indications were good point. I did not have to go back to manual to translate the number of beeps.These detectors were expensive. 3 stars for not lasting at least 10 years.Someone mentioned cleaning the detectors with compressed air. I will try this first next time before throwing them out. FYI, does the recommended life of about 10 years come from kind ofchemical or material used in the sensor? I would research this before assuming they should last a lot longer."
5,"Good product, great price","Easy to install, will set off other alarms on same circuit throughout the house, much better price through Amazon than the local hardware store or home depot."
4,Works as advertised,"Easy to install and set-up. I purchased three to replace the interconnected smoke detectors in my home. I had to wire-on the new connector but that was quick. If you currently have Kidde detectors, you probably won't have to do this step. I followed the start-up and testing directions and everything worked fine. The voice is some what muted but the alarms are loud."
4,Smoke Alarm,The product replaced the same product installed 7 years ago so it was hooked up to wiring in place. Instructions were clear and installation was easy with ordinarily available tools for average homeowner. If you are concerned about working on ladder and have no familiarity with wiring get an electrician.
1,programed to fail after 7 years,works well but no warning that between 7-8 years they will ALL fail. no warning of this ahead of time just recommendation to replace at 7 years. no warning that they will all fail. my home is large and has 45 detectors. what a surprise to find them all failing within 8 years of manufacture--NOT installation. check the dates (stamped on back of unit). if not current remember it will fail early
1,-0 - Quality Control,"Thank you, John Graham!! Both of my units developed the ""low battery"" syndrome -- and I would have had to call an electrician to install new ones! But your reverse-polarities trick seems to have worked! Thank you, thank you, thank you!~"
3,Replacing units,If you don't know Kidde CO units automatically go to a fault code after 7 years. SO I've been replacing them. I'm a little annoyed and I'd like to see the science that says they no longer work after 7 years but I don't want to not have them.
1,Dissatisfied customer,"Received product with missing items, never could connect item. Contacted shopdealonly, still waiting to hear back from them to send me a return label!!! Amazon was NO help to resolve this issue."
1,the worst kind of rubbish,"Seven of these were installed in a newly renovated house we bought 3 months ago. Now one remains. Constant low battery alerts despite having just changed the (not cheap) 9V battery. False smoke alarms up the wazoo. An ear-shattering cacophony every time one went off, as the other 6 units took up the hue and cry. The final blow was 3 carbon monoxide alerts in 2 days, with 1) the oil furnace not running, 2) no other sources of combustion in the house, and 3) my ADT-monitored CO detection system proclaiming all was well.I took down 6 of these and smashed them into plastic dust. My children called me a hero. DO NOT BUY, unless lack of sleep/peace of mind/sanity and visits from the fire company telling you your units are defective are luxuries you can live with."
2,false alarm,"This unit detects smoke just fine, but it sure doesn't distinguish between a real fire and a bit if smoke from the frying bacon. We get incessant false alarms when we're cooking. And if you hit the Hush Mode button, shouldn't it know that two seconds later you still want it hushed?"
3,Problem with false alarms,Had to return one. The replacement failed on installation (started sending false alarms almost immediately). Disconnected it and reinstalled a few days later. It seems to be working well now.
1,3a.m. Fire Drills -- not fun!,"Have these units on their own circuit breaker. When a storm went through the breaker was tripped and soon found out these units cannot live off a 9V battery for more than a day. They are also good for waking us up at 3 am with false fire alarms. Good way to find yourself in a ""boy who cried wolf"" situation."
4,Much too easy!,Needed to install two Carbon/smoke detectors and didn't realize Amazon had them. Ordered and received them within 7 days.Great Service!!!
4,CO-Smoke detector KN-COSM-1B,"This detector was purchased to replace one that finally failed after 7 years (the power light kept blinking and couldn't be reset and a single beep every few minutes; book says it's an 'end of life' signal.). It was one of two interconnected alarms. I wanted to maintain this interconnected system as it has worked well until the one unit failed. I was pleased that I could get an exact replacement (it fit right into the existing mounting plate and plugged into the existing connector) after 7 years. The price on Amazon beat the two retail stores I checked by more than $10, the item shipped the next day, and was received 3 days later. The only problem I have had with the detector is an occasional false alarm when the window AC unit on the same circuit starts up. I wish who ever wired the system had put it on another circuit.I am very satisfied with the ordering process, quick shipping, and price on Amazon."
5,replacement for old alarms,"I learned that even hard wired smoke alarms need to be replaced at least every 10 years, so I bought 6 of these. The directions for installation were easy enough to understand and the installation was a piece of cake (even for a klutze like me!) They all tested fine when I turned on the power."
5,Easy to install,We hope to never need this product but it does offer great peace of mind and is required by law. It was very easy to install and comes from a reliable brand.
5,Kidde combo alarm,A great product BUT needs replacing after 7 years or it starts to chirp.This fact is rarely published. I had to replace all three of my units. A fine product and price. Easy to replace.
4,They all worked!,"I bought 16 of them and they all worked! yay! They do have to be replaced every 7 years according to the sticker on the side because of the CO2 sensor... Thats why it gets 4 of 5,"
1,BUYER BEWARE!! A piece of junk,I bought and installed this detector less than two weeks ago and it has already crapped out. Last night is went into fire alarm mode and it won't stop. The location is smoke free & CO free (my cellar) and the battery is fresh. I have another CO sensor in the area so I know that CO isn't a problem since that one is running fine. I tried cleaning the sensor disk by opening the guts of the device (which voids my so-called warrenty) but that didn't help either. The Kidde web page is useless in troubleshooting since you get caught is a logic loop that puts you back where you start from when trying to solve this problem. BUYER BEWARE!!!
2,20% fail rate within 1 year,"We purchased 5 units in June 2011. Installation was very easy (the same as most other pre-wired household detectors). 5 units took me about 1 hour.11 months later, we had our first unit go into false alarm mode (fire). The LED indicator blinked about once every 15 seconds (not on their status list). Battery replacement doesn't help.So my questions as a consumer not answered on their web site:1) should I buy another one to replace it?2) should I invest the time, money, and effort to send ""the alarm with proof of date of purchase, postage and return postage prepaid"" for warranty service?3) what is the chance that the other 4 units in our house will do the same thing in the next 5 years?So, -1 star for product failure, -1 star for the hassle of pursuing their warranty repair (how do I prepay return postage on a box?), -1 star because now I WORRY about reliability of the other units that I count on to let me know when there is a fire or CO risk."
1,Warning! Warning! Warning!,"If you buy this product be prepared to be awakened repeatedly in the middle of the night by the unit going off screaming ""Fire!, Fire! Firer!"" and blaring its alarm for no reason. This unit was installed by electrician and is not near a fuel burning appliance or exposed to any other condition that would cause false alarms. It is only 7 months old. Also had problems with it being too sensitive when first got it. None of the other units (plain smoke detectors) go off with it or ever have, and we have never experienced this with any prior smoke detectors or CO detectors. And it only happens in the middle of the night. Had to disconnect."
3,BEWARE--battery polarity sticker could be incorrect.,"We have two of these in our new house, which we purchased as new construction a year ago. One of the detectors started chirping and announcing ""low battery"" every minute, so I replaced the battery in both of them. Lo and behold, both of them started making this noise and giving the warning. After much frustration and futzing (Kidde's phone line was no help--it merely directs you to their web site and then hangs up on you) I figured out that the unit must have been manufactured incorrectly, and the +/- terminals indicated on the sticker inside the battery bay were backward. Once I put a battery in backward, they sprung to life on battery power alone, and no longer give the warning.3 stars due to poor quality control. Kidde, if you are reading these reviews, you have a potential lawsuit if someone's alarm fails to work because their battery backup is installed backward (and per your instructions)."
3,Loose Use of a Model Number,"I purchased this to replace another unit with the same model. The bracket was already installed and the wiring was in place for the AC hookup. I assumed that purchasing another unit of the exact same model number would allow me to swap it out without changing the wiring or bracket. The new unit fit into the bracket, but the wiring harness for the AC is different. Now I have to rewire it to get the AC hookup. I'd like to think that the same model number would ensure compatible parts. Other than that the unit is OK, but nothing special."
1,"Poor design, loud false alarms that you cannot turn off","I bought several of these to add to and replace some hardwired Firex units in my home. Today, they false alarmed for the first time - nearly 6 months after installation. It was impossible to determine which unit was the trigger for the alarm. The hush button didn't work either. In fact, the button is poorly designed and can get stuck. I replaced the batteries in all of my detectors with fresh ones and still had problems. I am so frustrated with this product."
3,Operational Review,"Purchased 6 units and installed. They are tough to control. Days after installation one unit started chirping, I removed the battery, tested it and it was good(new). Installed it back in and it was good for until the next week when I found it chirping again. Replaced the battery and it started again. This is now continuing with the other units. The house is used on weekends and whenever I enter, one or two units are chirping, not alarming, and I go thru the same routine, reconnecting, battery changing etc. If this continues I will remove and dispose the entire set."
1,Piece of junk,"We followed the installation instructions, put in brand new ""recommended"" batteries and after 30 minutes of plugging it in kept getting battery low messages. Tried the manufacturers phone line 3 times to get it fixed with no answer, couldn't even leave a message! It took them nearly a week to respond to email, even though I completely explained the problem the only answer they had was to ask a question I had already answered. Needless to say it took them so long to respond the product was out of the 30 day return window. I now have to eat a 15% restocking fee on a product that never worked."
1,No Customer Service,"I bought two of these the beginning of the month. The end of last week, one of them started ""beeping"" every 30 seconds or so. I looked at the instructions that came with the unit and it stated to call their customer service number. Good luck! It rang, and rang, and rang. No one picked up, and there was no voice message stating their hours, etc. I'll be returning the unit to Amazon, I guess."
1,3stopped working within 2 weeks,"Have 3 in the basement for a few years. Change batteries every 6 mos. All 3 stopped working within 2 weeks ( 2 on the same day). Changing battery does not help, they still chirp. I think they are not made to last.Have to change all three. Not Happy."
2,Amazon must have old stock!,"This unit was exactly as described - but the units in Amazon's warehouse must be old stock, the battery had a production date two years ago! Or Kidde got a deal from Duracell on nearly dead old chinese-made 9v batteries. I didn't realize this until the unit started beeping in the middle of the (first!) night and saying ""Low battery"". Of course the reason I bought an AC powered alarm was to avoid exactly this scenario. So check your fridge for new batteries if you buy one of these Kidde products from Amazon."
5,Easy to hard wire and install,"It was straight forward as my previous alarms and also compatible. Hard-wired, run the test, and everything was done in 10 minutes. I will definitely purchase the same brand again when my old ones die."
4,Adequate,I initially bought this because I was considering a wired model and being interconnectable would be an excellent feature to incorporate in my house where some areas are less audible. I however was disappointed to find the warning on their model that says it's incompatible with off grid installations (I do not know if other models or brands have similar models)I am generally happy with this model but since I do not have a situation to test it's effectiveness... I can only say that I would perfer the kidde KN-COSM-B which is the 3AAA portable edition. The reason is that on further though and existing fire alarms it was easier to replace all the batteries every 6 months (cheaper too) than replacing 9v every year.
4,Fire alarm,"This is an excellent Fire alarm, very loud piercing sound, which works very well. Hope this helps you decide."
3,Mounting procedures,I thought it could be mounted to the ceiling with an existing electric outlet nearby. Instructions inside box said that it needed to be mounted to a junction box.
3,Interesting but not discriminating enough,"There are some nice example of diagramatic visualizations here. My one concern is that the authors were not discriminating enough in their choices. Mixed in with the powerful graphics are a number of chartjunk examples. In addition, in the ""how to"" sections a number of techniques (shading, perspective, etc.) were described without any indication that the use of these techniques actually detract from the visual integrity of the visualization.My suggestion is to pick a copy of Tufte's ""Envisioning Information"" before this one. After you have read Tufte, you will be able to pick out the good from the bad in this book."
2,"What you can do, not what you should do",A visually appealing book that shows off many digital effects and possible ways of creating digital diagrams. Whether or not you should do some of the things shown is another matter.This book is not for the serious Information Architect - but may be useful for a designer or graphic artist.Read Tufte and Wainer first - but then you won't find much new or useful here.
4,Great ideas for communicating with real people,"I found this book to be a very useful resource for creating visually interesting informational graphics. I'm a technical communicator for a marketing-oriented company working in a number of different media, including print and web, and it is important to be able to attract and keep people's attention while conveying information. It may be that some of the methods provided in this book contradict E.Tufte's doctrines, but an ivory-tower nose-in-the-air approach ain't gonna move no product! Maybe I'm not a ""serious Information Architect"" -- That being said, I found the author's presentation and descriptions of the various types of charts and graphs helpful, and some of his layout ideas will be immediately valuable to me in my work."
1,PU!!!!!,"I've never spent so much money on a lousey quality cd in my LIFE!!! I've owned bootlegs that had better sound quality than this!!!! Even played in a set of headphones, this thing is barely audible. STEER CLEAR OF THIS ONE!!!"
2,This book is bad book for a beginner.,As a beginner I found this book to be inadequate for my needs. There are 63 pages of nicely spiral bound(book lies flat) examples of various effects. That is to say... 63 pages of coloful rectangles with some comments about how to achieve a particular effect. It's sort of like reading the ingredients for a recipe but not telling you how to mix the ingredients or cook it.I imagine that this book has some use to an experienced airbrusher but I suspect that once you have the experience the book is not very useful and is merely a nice 63 page of pretty rectangles.This was not a good book for me.
4,Cute little mouse,"Very portable and does the purpose, I like to use this on my laptop since I prefer a mouse than the flatform. Highly recommendable if you travel with it and not much room around the computer."
2,Mini Mouse Review,"I loved the mouse at first, perfect to sit with my laptop that I keep in basically one location. But in only a few weeks the left click button stopped working, unless you push it in really hard. Quite annoying and disappointing."
5,Outstanding performances,"Reissued together withMonteverdi: Complete Duets 1 / Curtis, Il Complesso Baroccoas a double CD:Monteverdi: Complete Chamber Duets & Select Madrigals / Curtis"
4,Small Amp That Packs A Big Punch,"I just purchased this amp and I must say I'm very impressed by its capabilities. I already own a Line 6 Pod 2.0 guitar effects box and between the two, I have a whole array of great guitar and amplifier sounds now at my disposal. I plugged it in and the factory presets sound good, though I'd like to tweak it a little more and see what other great sounds I can come up with. The only reason I didn't give this amp a five-star rating is because of its low wattage for playing out live. If you're looking for an amp that could play a bigger venue, you may want an amp in the 75-watt and up range. For a small, friendly setting, this amp is more than sufficient. And, don't worry about what kind of guitar you play, whether it's a Fender Strat or a Gibson Les Paul, this amp offers you a nice clean sound all the way up to one of the nastiest, overdriven distortions (without a pedal) that I've ever heard. Overall, a great amp for a great price.Tim DetoreFort Lauderdale, Florida"
5,Extremely sharp and excellent color and contrast!,This is the first time I ever own a Zeiss lens. I am very impressed. Vow! was all I can say. Great combo when use with the Sony A55. It is worth the high price.
4,Zeiss Vario Sonnar,I am very pleased with this lens and the A100 combination especially the improved contrast and color rendition. I just took an entire wedding under overcast sky and the pictures look like they were taken on a sunny day. Now I reset the camera to a lower contrast and saturation level.SB
4,Great lens,"For still shots, this is a great overall lens. This has been my walk-around lens on my A65 for a few months. The clarity and color were amazing compared to the kit lens. I would have given 5 stars, but the auto-focus in movie mode isn't the best for action scenes. I think the consensus is to set to to manual focus at infinity, but for the price I was hoping for more performance when videoing."
4,The Seekers DVD,"What a shame the third and fourth TV specials by this group from Australia is not available.This DVD desires improvement in film quality but the video and music content is worth the purchase.If you liked the movie ""Georgie Girl"" this is a DVD to enjoy the music of the Seekers and realizethe world wide popularity of this group. Their performance before an audience of 200,000 is unequaled.Part of that performance is included in the DVD. The DVD provides a lot of information about Australiaand contains interesting video scenes. This group from the 60's is tops in song and talent."
5,I love this book,"There is simply nobody else writing like Brijbasi in the world today, as far as one can tell. His is a unique and miraculous talent to spin surreal stories that are at once as laugh-out-loud funny as a Woody Allen spiel, and as haunting and luminous as a painting by Balthus. Almost any of the pieces could be read as a prose poem. Every page in the book holds something wonderful, that I might name 'essence of question' - the type of inspired writing that positively refreshes the brain and sets its higher powers of thought racing. Dazzling, hilarious, daring, uncompromising, and he makes it all seem so easy. If you like Bunuel films, Chagall paintings, books by John Berger, and laughing your head off - you'll love this. Guaranteed."
4,"If you are on a Healing Path, buy this book.","This book is great. So far the information about the Shaman's techique seems to be very similar to techiques used by ancient Hawaiians known as Kahunas and also another technique which I am trained in doing which uses quantum physics as well. I have studied the Ancient Hawaiians' culture for several years and it is always interesting to read about other ancient teachings. In fact, the more I learn about the different ancient teachings the more I feel that they are all just ONE TEACHING. I am already interested in looking into a seminar which I found on the author's website.Dr. Villoldo writes in simple language and states his information in a clear concise way. He actually outlines how to do the process for yourself. When I finish the book I am doing the process for myself.You'll find it quite interesting."
2,A brochure?,"Soul retrieval works, regardless of whether we have an explanation for why/how or not. Science and technology has convinced the Western mind that they can and will have an explanation for everything when this is not true...This book was a disappointment to me in that is was a 250 page brochure for the services and teachings of Villoldo's Four Winds Society, where ""You too, can be a shaman for only $10,000- Call NOW!!"" If not you can pay for a private consult...If you want a book of his that supports changes in your life try The Four Insights and actually put the info to use. If you really believe you need a soul retrieval, find a reputable practitioner and discuss it with them... An ethical shaman/medicine person will interview you before taking next steps...Good luck."
4,"Interesting, informative and helpful","I have heard some opinions about Villoldo that he's not authentic enough, that he distills the techniques and ideas too much. However, I feel this book is a good introduction to soul retrieval and other shamanic techniques and ideas. It is well-organized, and laid out in an easy-to-understand and easy to follow fashion. The techniques are easy to learn and try. I think he should explain more forcefully in the beginning that these techniques carry a lot of power and that readers should not use them on others unless they have been trained by a teacher. Other books I would recommend for those who want to learn about shamanism are The Shaman's Body by Arthur Mindell and Keepers of the Ancient Knowledge by Joan Parisi Wilcox. You should also become familiar with Chakras and so read The Chakra Handbook by Sharamon & Baginski. You will also probably end up working with power animals and might like Animal Talk or Animal Speak I forget which it is."
4,recommended,"Many of the processes covered in the book are taught in Dr. Villoldo's Healing the Light Body School. I found that having the techniques,outlined in book form, very helpful as a reference guide. The personal experiences of the clients and author enrich the learning experience."
3,Yes and No,"I really liked this book when I read it. I found it inspiring, hopeful and engaging. The exercises presented where pretty good, but difficult without a guide or a cd...I believe there may be one that you can purchase separately? CD's are incredibly cheap, why not include one? I do believe there is too much selling of his ""Four Winds Society"" where you too can become a ""Certified"" Shaman for a small fortune. He talks a lot in this book about his private consultations with clients and then doesn't really offer them unless you are an advanced student, ie have dropped loads of cash already. The book itself was pretty good, but if you want to take it any further...prepare for a sticker shock. My advice, take half of the ten grand you will spend on four winds and go work with a Shaman...not a sorcerer (laika) in Peru. I did this and you will get a whole lot out of drinking ayahuasca and doing dieta in the jungle...oh yeah, but no laser printed certification, sorry."
4,wow,I met this shaman at Omega some years back. He's the real deal. We did a group thing that was of this world.
5,Mending the Past and Healing the Future With Sould Retrieval,"I purchased the Kindle version of ""Mending the Past and Healing the Future With Sol Retrieval"" and I found it to be very insightful. We have so much to relearn about our spiritual selves and this book will help."
5,This CD is my all time favorite!,"This is the best CD that I have purchased in a while. I play it ALL the time and have told all of my friends about it too! Phil Perry is real SMOOTH and with these classics you can't go wrong. Great arrangements, great voice, nice groove..... I love it!"
4,Ohio,"It is outstanding, anyone that is a Phil Perry fan will love this CD. There is no disappointment at all in this CD. If it is a first time for you picking this artist out, then the only thing I can say is that you pick a good one."
3,OK but some originals please,"I know the title is ""The Classic Love Songs"" but Perry's best work are his originals. He does outstanding covers having the best voice in the business since Luther's death. However, one feels a bit cheated with this CD. All covers and no new material does not a great CD make."
4,good collection,"back in the day the term busting your chops and earning your keep applied, and while Phil Perry is a journeyman Artist and never gonna be held up with the top tier or even main second tier cats in R&B singers, he certainly has range and talent. he has been around so long and yet his voice is still on point and this collection highlights him truly adding his own flavor to the standards of R&B he is covering. real smooth and on point.he has feeling and he ain't sleepy time when he hits them notes."
1,Luther????,"How those who review this ""covers"" CD from Phil can compare it in any way to Luther I do not know! - listening to this CD when not singing high range Phil really struggles and seems flat at times."
4,Punk Rock n' Roll,"Another great Canadian Punk Rock n' Roll band. I have had the pleasure of seeing The Exploders live a few times and they rock. This CD is damn good. The highlights are ""Teethclencher"" and ""Put On Your Wig"". As I said, it's a great album. but from what I have seen live their next recording will be the one to look for."
3,"Works great, tough to store",It works great. Very universal. Will hold a variety of tuners. The problem is that it doesn't fold down for storage. The solid L shape can be awkward to fit into the storage compartment in my case.
5,Best red-dot sight in the market IMO,Not a lot of hype around this scope. It must be the best kept secret of the shooting world. No other red-dot offers this sharp visibility in bright daylight. It is rugged. It is solid. It's made in the USA and Trijicon Customer's Service is second to none. The chevron reticle is both quick and accurate. I consider this 1x scope to be better than the offerings by the two leading brands. You won't be disappointed.
2,Beautiful illustrations but difficult language,"I'm a teacher, and believe me I want books to have some challenging vocabulary. However, this book is beyond the comprehension of most adults, let alone the young child audience that picture books are intended for. The illustrations are nice, but any child will be frustrated by the vocabulary (and adults will be frustrated at having to explain a word in every single sentence). I had planned to read this book aloud to a classroom, but it might as well be in Russian because they won't understand it at all, which is a shame because they are inherently interested in bugs."
5,This Book Gets to the Root of the Problem of Violence,"Addressing Violence is an excellent book on the subject of American violence. Although the book speaks specifically about a situation that occured in Springfield, MA, it is relevant to circumstances across the country.The chapter dealing with America's culture of violence really gives insight into how hypocritical it is for Americans to be shocked at any act of violence. It speaks plainly about the fact that we are inundated with violence everyday and actually enjoy our indulgence in it.This is a must buy for those exploring ways to address violence."
5,My 4 year old loved this until learned to swim,This vest is great. Better and easier to put on then the typical swimmies that go on the arms. Also safer since it can not slide off. I wish I had knew about it for my first kid.
3,Deluxe size 2,"Bought this swim vest for my 1 year old. Unfortunately, there wasn't any size recommendation before I order. It turns out to be too big for him to use. Can't comment much otherwise, but just ask anyone who is interest to find out the size before purchasing."
4,Is it? Could it be?,"In an amazing feat of accomplishment, a photography team that just moved to L.A. from Brooklyn, NY has written its first book?! Wow. I didn't even think he/they could really read! But here's the proof, and what proof it is. This book shows that Jeff Spinner not only understands the world he lives in, but relates it to reality as well. Not only that, he shows himself/themselves to be (a) savvy consumer(s) of identity politics, deflecting attention with obtuse attention-getting devises, while secretly writing a magnificent discourse on a really deep subject. Way to go, you DJ masta!"
2,Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now? Now? Now?,"I got this headset for my wireless landline phone so that I could do other things while talking on the phone. It doesn't work as well as I had hoped. I can hear the person I am talking too quite well, but they have a hard time hearing me. I have to hold the microphone in front of my mouth for them to hear me...and...well...that defeats the purpose I bought it for! It was very inexpensive (or should I say cheap?) so I guess you get what you pay for. I was hoping for better. Especially since it has the Samsung brand name on it."
3,Review,"Overall the book gives classical examples/methods from the EMC community on solving many of the problems we encounter. However the on line software is not accurate or user friendly, they would be better off putting everything into a mathcad or matlab formate.Overall a good reference if you are doing EMC analysis and prediction."
5,Great EMC book,This is probably the best book and analytical methods for EMC. I have not tried to use the software.
4,Swing play all day,"This is a great coffee mill. I am surprised it is no longer in stock here. It combines the classic grind it yourself style of grinding beans with the best modern machinery. The blades do a super job grinding your coffee. You just put the beans in, grind away, open the drawer and scoop the grounds into your filter. I use it to grind espresso beans for my moka pot, but you can use it for regular American style coffee beans and paper filter pots too. I also like the unfinished wood look of this grinder. These smaller manual grinders are much more useful to the home user than the larger electric grinders. You have more control over how much you want to grind. You only grind what you use and you don't leave a bunch of grounds or beans in the open to get stale. You can also order replacement blades and they are easy to change. Overall a really good grinder for the small kitchen user. Good luck finding one."
2,A let-down,"I was very excited about this book. I thought it would talk all about stuff important to readers, like reading more than one book at once, etc. Instead, it is more like a gag gift. It actually has a chapter on people who eat books! It left me disappointed. If you want a book about readers, for readers, about reading-oriented issues, not weird trivia, try Sara Nelson's ""So Many Books, So Little Time."""
4,Wonderful fun for all book-lovers.,"If you're seriously contemplating getting rid of the furniture so you have more room for books, or if every employee of every book store in town knows you by name, dash out and get Biblioholism!This wonderful book often had me laughing so hard that the bookshelves shook. Why anyone might consider that owning thousands of books could constitute an addiction is, of course, beyond me, but if you think you might have this dangerous bug, set aside some time to enjoy Tom Raabe's creation."
4,Biblioholism,"This is a fun little read. I already KNEW I was a book addict. I,however, am not ashamed or inclined to do anything about it. Indeed, I am a mite bit proud of this little addiction. The older I get, the fewer vices I have, and the less likely I am to change this particular habit. I love books. I love books about books! This book was fun to read and laugh at myself while doing so."
3,Fair,"I love books about books. I purchased this one on a whim. Although I like the comedic aspect of this book, it really did not fulfill my need to read about the love of books.I would definitely consider this more of a humour book than any kind of serious look at the love of books. Good for a laugh though."
3,"Book Is Descriptive, Not Analytical","I was disappointed with this book. I was hoping for a psychological analysis about why biblioholics need to consume books in excess, why they buy books when they already have hundreds, maybe thousands, of unread books at home. Instead, Raabe's text is more descriptive - describing different types of readers and buyers, various forms of bibliomania, ingenious ways to sneak books into the house, etc. On the plus side, this book is exceptionally well-written, entertaining and humorous. Just don't expect any real answers."
2,No good,This show is similar to A chinese ghost story but the former is not as good as the latter. The story and fighting moves are very badly done. Strictly for Cherie Chung's fans.
3,The bitter-sweet American dream,"The movie adresses many topics (too many ?) : the cultural gap between second and first generation Mexicans, the difficulty, hostility and loneliness illegal immigrants face, the issue of debasing oneself for others. I found some characters (Lola) a bit shallow, but the Mexican mother is truer than life.Too many coincidences in the plot may make the movie seem somewhat unrealistic at times.The end is filled with emotion."
5,Great Movie,This movie shows to struggles of English Language Learners in the United States. I would only show this movie to a 4 or higher level Spanish class.
5,Amazing!,I love this film! It is an brilliant portrayal of two people finding their strength to face life obstacles. It is definitely a must see film!
5,See this film.,"I found this film to be an engaging and honest look at the immigrant experience in the US. You won't be disappointed, the filmmaking is skillful and engrossing. Definitely a film that will open your eyes and keep you entertained at the same time."
5,Catholics can sing!,"I bought this album as a gift after having purchased it for myself in MP3 format. I am always delighted to find Catholic musicians doing contemporary music and this compilation is superb. I especially like the John Angotti selections, but it's all good. It was the kind of find for me that has me wanting more even as I realize this kind of album doesn't grow on trees."
5,Getting interesting,"This fifth episode was really good--better than episodes 2, 3 and 4 though not as good as the pilot. Murder in the new colony has more human interest and dramatic value than a mystery virus or an attack by ""birds"". This fifth episode shows that this show has real potential. The other episode which I liked was the one with the runaway girl, because this, more than any other episode, advanced the plot with the ""Sixers"", which is the most interesting plot of all, not only because of the drama but also because it can tie the various episodes together into a larger story."
3,A mixed bag.,"All you had to say was ""dinosaurs"" and I was there.I could probably sit here and pick Terra Nova apart all day. The special effects are, especially for this budget, kind of awful. It's a show FULL of cliches. The characters/acting are a bit flat.But at the end of the day, I'm really entertained and as a big ol' dinosaur geek I'm having enough fun with a (potentially) weekly dose of the terrible lizards that I'm willing to give it a chance.I've only seen the pilot so far. I may end up giving up or raising my grade based on future episodes. It's really up in the air. But either way, I'm in for at least the time being."
4,Could be better,"IMO this is a good idea for a show, but its just a little too ""Disney"" I dont understand why everyone in the show is hot, I havent seen one fat guy in the entire show. the Shannon family looks weird like a bunch of Disney channel actors. Also the show is just a little too PG-13. There is a lot of stuff that doesnt make sense in the show, why arent there more dinosaurs, how come even all the bad guys look like a bunch of models? and whole bad guy army look great, but act like a bunch of pansies. One thing I absolutely LOVE though, is the Taylor guy he is absolutely prefect for the role, and so is Shannon. Shannons wife and kids get on my nerves tough, too Disney world, like the whole show. Also the soldiers uniforms look freaking stupid."
2,So much potential...,"OMG, this is almost un-watchable. I don't understand. Big name folks involved. $$ spent on effects and sets. You've begun with an interesting premise. But the story is garbage. Recycled garbage at that. Pushed along by hopelessly cliched dialogue. How sad. Who is the target market? Why is the leader doing an ""Aw shucks ma'am""/Marshall Dillon impression? There is no chemistry between the husband and wife. The sullen misunderstood teenager plot line has been done to death. Let it rest in peace! I guess I answered my own question. The target market are kids who are too young to recognize the cliches. To them it's new stuff. Okay... Well, I'm going to watch a Firefly episode to cleanse my pallet."
4,Enjoyable!,"I agree with the one reviewer in that this is a little bit Jurassic Park and Lost with a touch of Avatar and Lost in Space. The Shannon family characters are likable although the family tensions in the story line are rather standard, but I believe are typical and expected for the average family. The other main characters are likable, but are unknown sources -- good guy? bad guy? somewhere in between? Even the Sixers while initially seeming to be the bad guys give a hint of perhaps being not. Maybe ?. It was an enjoyable pilot -- it raised enough tension and questions to help get the story started in several different directions. It has the potential to be a really good series. I am looking forward to next week!"
2,Bought on a whim,Not a very good show at all but I half expected that. Not a huge loss in my opinion. Oh well!
4,Too bad it was cancelled early.,"The show was amazing, great story-line, great suspense. Plot was well done, interesting topic. Everything was planned out real well, but unfortunately, it was cancelled early."
1,"Unbelievable, Unexciting","The storyline is slow with many action scenes being simply unbelievable. I cannot recommend anyone watch this show, which is sad because the show concept could be very fun."
3,Terra Nova,Terra Nova is the title for episode 5 of Star Trek Enterprise. Just A little FYI. Have not seen the FOX show.
2,"Men with guns, telling people what to do, policemen thinking they","don't have to follow the same rules as eveyone else. Gee, that sounds so familiar, why did they leave earth in the first place? Macho military personnel in charge, armed to the teeth in firearms. Don't sound like paradise to me. Sounds like more of the same. I don't see this farce lasting too long, hopefully."
1,Boring,"After watching the first episode I was utterly bored. Stupid teenagers doing stupid things is no longer fresh or interesting. Mom and Dad getting to know each other and figure out how to work together again after a separation is as uninteresting as it gets. The bada$$ Man in Charge, is even more boring than the stupid teenagers doing stupid things.What I wouldn't give for a show where at least one character uses his or her brain on a regular basis. One show where teenaged angst isn't the rotten meal of the day. One show where someone with some spark of creativity was allowed free rein for at least 10 seconds. This isn't that show."
2,"Lame, predictable pablum","The premiere failed to reach orbit, held back by unimaginative dialogue and predictable scares that we've seen in so many other films. The family at the center of the drama fails to engage us with any real emotion, and the parents and teen children are cardboard cutout stereotypes. The action sequences were barely B-movie quality, with kids trapped inside vehicles that were being mechanically shaken over, and over, and over. Blech."
1,No viewing rights?,Not understanding why they are selling a season pass to a show that they do not have rights to show to you. Why am I getting charged for the new episode when I can't even watch it?
5,She did it again!!!,"The wonderful 2 part story of Lucy and John Wayne. These ""I Love Lucy"" shows are casted in Hollywood, CA. Lucy and Ethel meet John Wayne, and Lucy just has to get his footprints from the Graman's Chinese Theater. They are spotted, and as usual, the whole thing is a big mess of tricks, stunts, and is just plain hilarious. You will love this."
4,What Do Husbands Think About?,"Funny book. Makes me think of what might happen if the protagonist of NEVER MIND NIRVANA actually DID marry and decide to settle down.How does remain faithful, especially when one is in love with one's spouse and there is a half-naked woman in the window of the next building? And can one stay on task when working from home?Very dry wit, neatly written. Very enjoyable. Worth a couple of reads."
5,This is a must-have reference for any Asiaphile.,"Terry Durack has written the penultimate reference book for all serious noodle-heads, or wannabes. If you've ever wandered the aisles of an Asian market, enchanted yet baffled by fresh, dried, yellow, green, white, thin, fat and medium noodles...get this book. Noodles are ID'd with photos, then identified in 3 or 4 languages, how-to-cook, how to serve and recipes follow. Fabulous recipes and, as a bonus, you'll be educated AND entertained by Durack's wicked sense of humor. No cook should be without this one!!"
4,Review of Noodle,"A really unexpected and wonderful book on as many noodles you would ever want to encounter. I shall have great fun and enjoy the finished products.Thank you, Una"
1,Crummy,"As another reviewer commented, hinges broke immediately upon removing fan from the box (whole thing is held together by 2 dime-sized pices of paper-thin plastic). Fan is useless without them. Additionally, fan is advertised as battery or AC operated, however an AC adapter power cord is not included. Whole thing is typical of the quality I should have expected from a cheap plastic chinese-made item, I suppose."
5,O 2 Cool,"I got this item about 3 weeks ago. I am using it to cool the LCD TV light engine in the back of the TV, that give off enough heat to fry an egg. Does it cool the inners of the TV? Sure does!!! I can actually touch the back side of the TV without feeling like I am going to burn my hand. It is not quiet at first, but once the TV is on, you cannot hear it.Yes, this is O 2 Cool!Update 12-23-08: After using this fan for only 11 months, not everyday, the noise level is now unbearable. It is a rattling/vibrating noise. It is now going in the dump. I do not recommend such a fan. Find something else."
1,It worked quietly for 2 weeks...,"It worked quietly for 2 weeks, then it started making noise. The noise got louder, and I had to replace it."
1,Awful quality. Very cheap,"I ordered this as a present for my mom. When I got it one of the hinges was already broken and PART of the missing part that chipped off was floating around in the box. Soon after the other hinge broke. The fan still works, but has to be propped up. Definately NOT worth your money!"
1,Battery Operated Fan,These fans were defective. The base of the fan was cracked on each side. I was not able to stand the fan up because of the base being cracked. I ordered 4 fans and all 4 were cracked. I would not recommend these fans.
5,Excellent Commentary!,"Highly recommended Bible commentary. Clear and insightful. Purchase along with the Old Testament Commentary. Thank-you for selling this item,A+!"
3,Questionable?,This book was lent to me by a friend and I noticed that David Jeremiah gives it high praise. But when I was trying to figure out how to talk to a friend who is a Jehovah's Witness about their belief that Jesus IS NOT in fact God I went looking for a scripture and thought John 10:30 would be perfect. But then I opened this book for clarification and it says this scripture DOES NOT say this.I searched other places including sites online and everyone else seems to believe He is in fact stating this here which is why the Jews want to stone Him.I always thought this to be the case but this book says that that is erroneous.Can anyone help me understand this?
4,Bible Commentary,"This book is in great shape, just as it said. It isn't exactly the one that I thought it was going to be, but it works just the same."
5,This book is a must for serious Bible study.,"This book is a must for serious Bible study. The commentary is detailed and gives many references, historical and scriptural, to back it up. It focuses on what the Bible says, not what someone wants it to say. This is a wise choice."
5,The Bible Knowledge Commentary,This is a great commentary. The explanations of scriptures are indepth and easy to understand. I would recommend it to anyone who is a serious student of the bible.
2,Black Cherry Gum,Took along time getting here about 2 1/2 weeks to get here but it is a good product. Shipping was just slow.
1,Not that hot,I purchased this CD and was very disappointed in the quality of the playing. The four musicians play with an almost unbearably bright tone color and their technique together is not as clean as some other groups. Don't waste your time here - pick up a recording the Rascher Quartet or Paul Cohen's quartet instead.
1,Bad Game!!!!!,"It would be a good game if it was licensed by the MLBPA so, you can have the real players names. Baseball Mogul is better because there are the real players there."
1,"Good Questions, Poor Step 3 Review","I used this Q-Bank book to review for step 3 along with Crush. The questions in this book are good and reflective of the information covered in Crush. Problem is, the questions are in no relation to what was asked on Step 3. I thought I was going to do well on Step 3, I recieved 225 on Step 1, and 230 on Step 2, but somehow by memorizing crush and this Kaplan Q-Bank, I managed to do poorly on Step 3. I was very disappointed on test day to realize that none of the questions from Kaplan even remotely resembled the questions on Step 3."
2,boring,This is a very slow movie. It has English subtitles. I wouldn't waste time buying it. Just got it at the library and knew nothing about it. Only good part is seeing how real Indians live. I've been to India several times and it has a real authentic atmosphere.
5,10 STAR REVIEW,"The 365 Stupidest Things Ever Said calendar is the ONLY calendar worth owning. It's Whiz-Bang FUNNY and also quite functional. I write my daily store list on the back of the prior dates page. The Produce Manager in our local store often finds me laughing out loud while staring at the lettuce. I know he thinks I'm crazy. Don't care. I'm off to buy lettuce now. Maybe today, I'll show him my ""store list."" Or, maybe not. GREAT CALENDAR. Love it. Keep 'em coming!"
1,A real DUD!,"This one has been a real disappointment to me. I received this as a Christmas gift because I asked for it. There may be some stupid things said here, but most of them (the month of January anyway) aren't really that funny. I've used lots of funny calendards over the years and enjoyed most of them. But this one just isn't funny. Although there are some exceptions (like Al Gore's inventing the Internet comments) most of the entries are really nothing more than inadvertent slips of the tongue. Given the utter stupidity of many public people in the things that they actually mean to say there is no dearth of material available. Instead, the editors of this calendar seem to be more interested in minor slips of the tongue. I suppose they might be funny if you were there. But reading them on a calendar page has barely made me smile let alone laugh. I need to laugh so I just bought another calendar (Our Dumb Century) which I hope will be an improvement."
1,Absolutely horrible,"I have the 2003 edition. It's terrible.As others have said, nothing but dumb typos (or bad language translations). Incredibly lame attempts at humor.Spend the money on Dilbert, Far Side, etc. Skip this."
5,A laugh a day,"This will be my third year with this laughable lunacy. One could say that I'm addicted at this point. I recieved my first Stupidest calendar as a gift and now buy one for myself, in addition to buying them as gifts for others. The best thing in my mind: Rather than being one single type of humor, it's a collection of different forms -- quotes from people in the public eye, odd headlines, misbegotten newspaper typos, mistranslations. It covers a wide range -- a veritable cornucopia of hilarity, if you will. Highly recommended for personal use or gift-giving."
5,Funniest Calendar Ever Read!,"I really love this calendar -- my only problem is I always read ahead at least a month, then have to wait for the next month to get new stuff -- call me frustrated! Can't wait for next year's to come out."
4,Great Calendar for work!,"I received this 2001 calendar as a gift and can't wait to get a new one. This calendar is filled with great quotes and clippings from some of the most recognized individuals making flubs and goofs of themselves. Talk about open mouth, insert foot!!! As an Administrative Asst, I keep this on my counter at work and it brings everyone to my desk daily to read!"
3,Just Average Somewhat Lame,"I received this calendar as a gift. Some of the items are funny but as previously noted many of the ""Things Said"" are actually not quotes just typos from newspapers and such; which would be OK if they were funny but many aren't. Today's ""page"" is a good example of one of the unfunny listings, it reads: ""Her Peugeot 406 Estate Collided Head-On with a Fish at the Big Tree Bend, Near Inverkeiler. from the Aberdeen Evening Express.""The best thing about the calendar is that it comes with an on-line code that allows you to one free on-line calendar at the Page-A-Day website. The on-line calendars are exactly the same as the print version in terms of content. You can chose from any of the Page-A-Day calendars not just the one that matches your paper calendar. You can also sample before you select."
2,Not really that funny,"Way too much of this is not quotes at all; just typos from newspapers or signs that accidently turned a harmless word into a ""naughty"" one. Today's quote is ""Well stocked panty."" from a newspaper add. They should have stuck with actual stupid sayings from politicians and celebrities and not padded this with all the typos."
3,It was OK. But I wouldn't buy it again.,There are a few funny ones in there but nothing to wipe tears from laughter away. I thought it would be a lot funnier. I bought it for my husband to take to work and it is still sitting at home so I guess he doesn't like it that much either.
2,Disappointed,"I read the reviews online and picked this up assuming it would be a great whodunnit. I was disappointed. I have read much better, more puzzling mysteries. I didn't find this especially gripping or surprising. I think it's a real gift to write a good mystery, and I don't think this author has it. It's not a bad book, by any stretch, but it's not a book that grabs and doesn't let go."
4,"Good, but not great","I liked the story but found the way it was put together a little odd. I'm speaking of the chapters about each member of the Norbois family that the author describes. I just could never quite get into them. I didn't feel a lot of sympathy for them. I did like the fact that it was an easy, quick read and have found the horror of the event, which supposedly was based on a real story, has stuck with with me. For this reason alone, I give the book high marks."
3,"intriging subject, but more details please",The subject is one I remember and looked forward to reading the book although it's fiction. When finished I found myself looking for much more information.
5,Read in one sitting...,"Though simply written, this was a novel I couldn't put down. The slower character development in the beginning pays off when the pace picks up mid-novel and never stops. There are plenty of small twists to the plot and every character gets their due. I think the strength of this novel set in Northern Michigan is that it is underwritten. You read on to get more...more sense of the victims, more sense of the community, more sense of the killer. The characters were so real I still find myself thinking about them. Reading this story makes me want to go into the archives and read about the true murders that this story was based on. A VERY intriguing read."
3,"Not a ""Holiday"" DVD","Again bought this DVD for my 4 year daughter who loves cats, but it's the same exact DVD as ""Kitten Party."" Save your money and just buy the regular one."
5,For Any Party,I got my hopes up thinking the dvd was a xmas special however it's just a holiday package with the original dvd. Still worth every penny. Who can resist a bunch of cute kittens playing around in your room without having to clean up after them?
1,Deceiving Cover!,"We already had the original Kitten Party and thought this would be a good addition. To our surprise, it is the exact same DVD as the original with just a different ""Holiday"" cover! The DVD is very cute, but this gets only 1 star due to the very deceiving cover!"
3,Kittens!,"The voices along with the DVD are pretty annoying, but if you are into watching kittens romp about doing kitten-like things then this DVD is for you.I purchased this to cheer up my girlfriend that can't have a cat in her apartment. At first she was annoyed by the voice in this video but then the little fluffs melted her heart.Meow!"
2,Well looks like we got burned,"I BOUGHT THIS BOOK THINKING I WAS GOING TO BE ENLIGHTED WITH SOME ADVANCED TROUBLESHOOTING KNOWLEDGE. I AM A PC TECH AND THIS BOOK JUST GOES INTO DETAIL ABOUT ALL THE COMPONENTS THAT MAKE UP THE SYSTEM AND THEIR HISTORY.IF YOU ARE A+ CERTIFIED YOU ALREADY LEARNED ALL THIS INFORMATION AND YOU`LL JUST LOOSE INTEREST RIGHT FROM THE START BECAUSE THE WRITER IS JUST REHASHING ALL THIS SAME INFO.THIS BOOK IS 713 PAGES AND THE LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLESHOOTING INFORMATION IN THE BOOK WOULD FILL NO MORE THAN FIFTY PAGES,JUST A LOT FLUFF SO THEY CAN MAKE THE BOOK AS THICK AS THEY CAN.THIS BOOK MIGHT ACTUALLY BE SOME GOOD FOR A PERSON WHO MAYBE IS JUST STARTING OUT,AND WANTS TO LEARNED EVERYTHING FROM THE BEGINING AND GETTING READY TO LEARN A+.IF YOU ARE ALREADY A TECHNICIAN YOU`LL JUST GET BURNED.ALOT OF AUTHORS SEEM TO BE TRYING TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK WHENEVER POSSIBLE.""PC TECHNICIAN BLACKBOOK"" THERE ARE NO SECRETS HIDDEN IN THIS BOOK GUY`S."
5,Excellent book for Sandusky lovers.,"Charles Frohman is an important figure in Sandusky lore, but this book is a font of knowledge for lovers of Erie County minutia like my mother-in-law is. She grew up 2 blocks from his house!"
4,does what it's supposed to do,"The unfortunate thing about this product is it hardens after several uses, but it is necessary to have these pads in order to use the dermabrasion equipment. These really should be available in stores."
2,Disappointing for a Janis fan,"Ms. Siegel is a great singer and vocalist, but this one is a snooze. Go for Tender Trap or the new Broadway album instead."
2,Basic How To Book - disappointing,"This book is for the beginner who has less than no idea where to start. It does have basic how-to info but I found the examples and dolls in the book very disappointing. I feel like even though I have never done a fashion doll repaint I can do at least as good a job as the author did if not better. I was expecting a lot more and if I had paid full price for this book I would have returned it. (I bought a used one) I don't want to be mean but the nose holes on one doll looked like boogers and the Julia Roberts repaint doll's lips were disturbing. If you want just the basics on how to get started then buy the book, if you expect more then don't."
2,Before you buy...TRY,"If you can't draw a circle, then you might want this. For the rest of us, I found the pictures of artwork done by the author a joke. They look like a child painted ALL of them except the one on the front cover which must have taken her years to perfect. She had a few tips that were helpful but I'd go to the bookstore and write it down before I would buy this."
5,Destined to Witness: Growing Up Black in Nazi Germany...,"I finally finished the book Monday (08/10/2010). Of all the semi-autobiographical texts I've ready, this has to rank among the best ever! I've known about this book on Amazon (for years), but until recently, I didn't have the time (or the patience) to read any books. Well, shame on me! The young Mr. Massaquoi was a real trooper for dealing with the twin demons of racism and politics. Even through all of that, there were people that took him at face value, befriended him, and bestowed upon him friendship, respect and love. Where (pardon my poor paraphrasing of Dr. Martin Luther King!) he was ""judged on the content of his character, not the color of his skin."" A masterful work that ended much too soon (in my opinion)!An interesting man, who led an interesting life!I give Hans Massaquoi (and his book) 5 stars!"
5,phenomenal view of the Germans before and during Hitler,"I am so thankful to the author for sharing his story. There is information in this book not found anywhere, and it's so well-written that I can't put it down. This record really makes clear, too,the wide range of humanity (and lack-of) in Germany before and during the Nazi days. One very moving piece is the author's mother, who, without doubt, gave him the strength of character to endure so much pain and grow up to be a fine person. Also, the teacher during his first year of school--in all my days of school in THIS country, I never saw such fine character in a teacher! And...And...And...So many unbelievable people in a sea of horror.This account sheds light on civil rights issues, everywhere (and we learn a bit about Liberia, too!)This is an phenomenal book. Completely original and beautifully written."
2,Disappointing,"I found this book to be disappointing. The author spends too much time explaining and describing things which add nothing to the main point of the book; an extraordinary tale of survival in Nazi Germany. I found that the story could have been told in less than half of the pages that the author uses and not spend countless chapters on descriptions of relatives and acquaintances that have little to do with the overall story. The bottom line is that, fortunately for the author, nothing much happens. I am happy that the author was not actively persecuted and that he was able to survive that totalitarian regime. But, unfortunately for the reader, it doesn't make much of an attention-grabbing story.For a real captivating real-life account of living in a critical situation I recommend The Gate by Francois Bizot."
5,Destined to Witness,This is such an extraordinary story and gives us an angle on history that maybe we had never thought about. We must not forget what the Jews went through during WW2 but we must also remember that others such as Blacks were also victims of hatred. It is incredible how individual human beings can be so unkind and even harder to imagine how those individuals can behave so cruelly towards a child. All credit to that boy who survived and found the strength to make something of himself. I've never read a book like it.
2,Destined To Witness,I could not even finish this book. It was written with such arrogance and puffing!I found the author to be quite contrive about the true nature of the Holocust and more intent on his personal injustice.He was lucky that he was young and had friends in Germany. His father being a king of some sort is put high onhis list of achievements although the treatment of the women involved with himself and his father would not be so prized.I am going to put this one down and go on to something more worth my minds time. ~
2,The book wasn't good and couldn't finish it!,The author didn't write it good. It made you feel like you wasn't in at the time of his childhood. So I thought it was lousy writing. All he was doing was describing it and details and other stuff like events but they way he described it was like you wasn't in the book. To let you know I didn't finish the rest of the book.
5,Absolutely fascinating!,"A really good book on what it was like to grow up in Germany during the 30's & 40's---the bonus being some real relevations, such as his observation that most kids joined the Hitler Youth after being pressured by their elders but most dropped out after a month or so! (p. 104-). I think Massaquoi's narrative does a good job at piercing some of the stereotypes many of us held about the German people during this period."
5,Hans J. Massaquoi Growing up as a Black in Nazi Germany,"What a wonderful book I truly enjoyed reading it. I am German, 44 years, my son is German 25 years with a Afro American father. I raised him in Germany and he is a true black German.We experienced together racism and I saw ourselves a lot in this book.Today we live in the USA and sadly he learned much more about racism here than ever before in his life.I am saddened by the thought that his goal is to go back to Germany because of these reasons - this is just to show you how times have changed. I hope for all of us that my beautiful brown babies my grandchildren that I will have one day never will have to experience anything like Hans or Frederick Douglass."
5,Fond memories,"As a Mischling, I want to thank the author for sharing his experiences. Even so born after the war, I share many of his experiences, both in Germany and in the USA. Racism I didn't experience until I came to the US, covertly from White and openly from Blacks. The pictures in the book, substituting a little balck girl, could be mine, the experiences of reading Uncle Tom's Cabin and Huckleberry Finn, could be mine. Reading the book made me even more greatful to my wonderful German grandparents for raising me. I do feel embittered about the American Government for ignoring us, specially after the efforts that were exerted for children left behind in Vietnam."
3,A little gem,"RETURN IN RED is no less than a find. Its title may intrigue, but the packaging (borrowing from 28 DAYS LATER) is generic and for lack of marketing budget we know nothing of the movie. It's 'small', it's Americana, it's paranoia and, most of all, it starts very slow. But it has GREAT atmosphere, the - for the most part - amateur acting is not bad, actually quite fitting, and the basic assumption, however simplistic, is convincing enough.A great little movie that deserves better than the minimal festival attention it has gathered."
3,Kinda.,This movie will leave you wondering and hoping that it can not happen. Makes us wonder what all the government can do???
3,"Not the best, but far from the worst zombie film","I was folding laundry while watching this particular zombie flick, and for the most part it was entertaining. Low budget and some issues with lighting and sound from time to time, but the actors did what they could with the script. Three 1/2 stars. Jan 5, 2013"
1,Slooooooooooow movie,"I like indie movies since you can find some real gems but this movie was just way too s-l-o-w.Storyline worked given the initial premise of the movie. Acting was decent indie stuff. Cinematography and visuals was actually pretty good. It's just the movie is sooooooo damn s-l-o-w! Scenes just dragged on and while it worked in a few parts to ratchet up the tension, for most of the movie any sense of dread or horror was overwhelmed by my irritation to get the movie over and done with. My eyes went on autopilot and my brain started drifting onto other things. As it is I can't even remember half the movie and I literally just got done watching it."
1,complete waste of time,"I think that the director does an amazing job at building a creepy atmosphere, but that where it stops. The first 20 minutes were enough to establish that something was very awry in this little factory town, but then the movie goes nowhere- very slowly.No clear middle, climax, or end even in this movie. They could probably have cut 50mins of nothingness from the film and it would have been the same movie. Add a little action, and it could have been good. But as is, this film was awful"
1,Good movie for taking a nap,"Saying that this movie is slow would be an understatement. Molasses moves faster. I'm usually a bit leary of films written and directed by the same person and in this case I was right to be. Somehow I managed to watch the first 40 minutes without completely falling asleep. After that I started fast forwarding. As one reviewer said, it's an interesting concept done with very poor execution."
2,LOST COMMANDMENTS= LOST MONEY,I'm a big fan of Malevolent..never seen them live..wanted to check them out on dvd..this is a disappointment. Whoever filmed this bootleg is a moron..it's shot from like 20 feet away. The only positive to this is that Brett Hoffman pulls off a great job singing all the classics..the second dvd with Kyle Symons is inaudible and poorly filmed. I recommend this for die hard fans only. For a band that has been around 20 years..this is inexcusable for a first dvd release.The behind the scenes footage doesn't even include the band and the photo gallery is blurry and pointless.I hope they produce a professional one soon.
1,CLA-60 Defective out of box,"I purchased the Sony Ericsson Cigerette Lighter Adapter CLA-60 with a new Sony phone. It would not charge the phone or the light would not work the first time plugged in. I emailed SF Planet who promptly sent me another along with a pre paid return label. The replacemet works. The Sony adapter is not made very well, the light switch is very delicate."
2,defective or made of inferior materials?,"I'm an avid SE product user. I was totally disappointed when my charger stopped working after 2 weeks. The green light works but the phone will not charge, nor will the map light work.I could have gotten the same results with an aftermarket product!Unfortunately, I threw the packaging away assuming I had a quality product."
1,Better take two tents,I took this tent on the AT and replaced a heavier 4-person with it. I liked the weight and it poured the first two nights and we stayed dry so I liked the fact that it was somewhat watertight. Can't complain about condensation if you have a single walled tent. The third night there was about a 12 inch separation from the side and the bottom. Lasted one more night then to return it I had to clean it and package it. Putting it back up to clean caused the seam to separate all the way down one side and across the back. It's more airy now. Unfortunately now according to Mountain Hardwear I get a credit to use on another tent manufactured by them. I would recommend you get any tent besides this one. I'd rather have a sore back from more weight than throw away money!!
1,Good information but very poorly laid out for free stuff,"This manual contains valid and useful information but is very poorly laid out. The table of contents and the index contain not one single page listing, Duh! Additionally all the figures are at the end of the chapter, hand drawn, hand written figure numbers or just plan missing. But the kicker is this and most of the sniper/target interdiction books are available in pdf format for free. Contact me at my email address. This is so typcial of the publishers Paladin Press, Delta Press, etc."
4,Excellent for the basics,"This manual was well written, concise, and without opinion. The manual, written at fifth grade level is easy to understand though the pictures and diagrams leave much to be desired. Great range estimation chapter! Definate recommended reading."
1,Dont waste your time,"One Star for catchy title........I wouldnt waste your time or money. Looks like copies of old Army regs, even uses the old M-24 Sniper system. Get Major John Plasterers Book on sniping much better. I thought this book might help out an old retired sniper (BS) I learned more in BasiC Training.........It honestly looks like copies of copies of copies of old US Army regs pasted together......dont waste your money. I would rather purchase a great book on lessons learned in OIF and OEF from snipers than to have wasted money on this...........I learned nothing and I have been out of the game for awhile. Dont waste your time or money, again, buy Major John Plasterers book on Sniping, google his name, it will come up I am sure, much better stuff there......"
1,Very small & very little sound,I ordered this item from another vendor and it was a piece of...well you get the point. It is so small that water coming out of the toilet sounds better. Buyer Beware.
5,A treasure.,"Any Lautner enthusiast will be captivated by this book. It covers more buildings than any of the others, and includes Lautner's own comment on each, making it an invaluable record of Real Architecture.Most of the photos in this book appear to have been taken shortly after the buildings were completed (and some during construction), so it makes a great companion to ""The Architecture of John Lautner,"" which has mostly rescent photographs. Together, the books give a facinating ""the and now"" contrast, and demonstrate the timeless quality of Lautner's work."
3,Educated Opinion,"This is a good product. I do find, however, that taking this with stabilized Glutathione and Amla berry exponentially improves results. Camu Camu is not stabilized and breaks down if not consumed soon after harvesting. Amla berry stays bio-active much much longer. Be well."
3,Interesting topic,A friend introduced me to this book. I was disappointed when I got it because this copy was a smaller print an size. I prefered the larger book. The topic is very good.
5,EXCELLENT....I feel so much better!,"I cannot believe what a difference this book has made in my life. I did not realize how tired I was until I began following the guidance of this book in avoiding certain foods and including others in my diet. Within a week I was feeling better. I had no idea how tired and sluggish I had been--I have so much more energy now, particularly in the evenings when I was usually tired after coming home from work. I highly recommend that you try this book. It's easy to read and well worth the time and money."
5,Allergies - very helpful input!,"While a lot of the material in this book is necessarily duplicated from other books published by D'Adamo in case the reader starts with this book, the real medical assistance offered has been very helpful to me - teaching me to manage my allergies proactively!"
2,So so,"Poems leave you with a daze or should when they're good like youhave been amazingly changed in a small way. These seem like theytry too hard like they are too obvious so you don't feel like that. At least I didn't. I like the use of the words, I just didn't find them clicking together in a way that made them more than just the words. I'm not a major expert or English person; somebody gave me this. So some of what other people are saying goes over my head. But I guess I shouldn't have to be an expert to ""get this"" or have it get to me."
1,don't bother,"don't waste your time reading this collection because there is nothing fresh or worthwhile within these pages. here's an example:The industrial laundry's heady bleachdizz eeped into the gray gold street Iwalked alone. As if a bird formed it-self out of my breastbone and flew off. Asif I walked through stands of blasted cedarsshaking down sapped drops of leftover rainfrom prehistoric crooks and limb lops-Breast. Mouth. Thigh. Zipper. Cream.Repeat.Breast. Mouth. Thigh. Zipper. Cream.Make babies. Here come the babies. The End.i'm guessing that daisy thought she was being inventive but she comes off more as a hack. she probably thought ""bleachdizz eeped"" sounded cool. maybe if she would spend more time with her craft and not with trying to sound hip then maybe this collection would be worth your time."
2,Why icky? Insects are cool.,Why 'icky' bugs? Why encourage children to be wary of nature at such a young age? I suppose we should also write books entitled 'Boring Math' and 'Really Hard Science.'
1,Did not like at all,I gave this book the 75 page tryout and just didn't like the style of writing. The subject seemed good and I would watch the movie but I just couldn't read it
2,I disliked this novel!,"I felt no sympathy for Susan Burling Ward or her grandsonLyman. Lyman is a person who can not live his own life but has tolive his grandparents' life while critiquing the world he presently lives in and all who are of its generation. I hate Susan in this novel, Oliver paid for her huge mistake of not even paying the closest attention to her own daughter, who I might add is not old enough to take care of herself. Susan is a terrible mother and wife to her hopelessly devoted family, why did she breed? She is a socialite, a snob and an inconsiderate human being and I dont understand why Oliver would subject himself to her foolishness for forty years after what she did. Lyman is just a pathetic exuse for a human being! He is booksmart but dumb about the world around him I did not like this novel one bit."
3,"Good story, but something's missing","The most interesting part of the book for me was Lyman Ward. I did not feel pity for him, but found his thoughts on ""contemporary"" 1970 society vs. his own and his grandmother's time and morals extremely telling of what the (late '60s) time was like for people like Lyman and Stegner (who was 61 at the time of publication). But I had some trouble really caring about Susan and Oliver, or little Ollie even. But the use of Lyman as narrator and participant was well done. It does not fit my image of a Pulitzer winner, with the likes of ""Old Man and the Sea"" and ""The Caine Mutiny."" ""Angle of Repose"" is a good, but not great book."
3,oldie but goodie,"This book was written forty years ago, but well worth reading. However when choosing a vendor to receive the book, I chose a middle price one. Lo and behold about in the middle of the book there was a repeat of 70, yes seventy pages, and so seventy pages are missing. I am finishing the book. It is a very interesting history of a family as related to the settling, mining, and water development of the good old west."
4,"A haunting story, but...","First of all, I wanted to like this book more than I did. It was the innaugural choice for a newly-formed book club of college professors here in Idaho, so with much of the book taking place in Boise, I wanted to ""connect"" somehow to the state I'm in.The ""historical"" story between Oliver and Susan was by far the most satisfying. I didn't really appreciate the way the story was ""framed"" through the eyes of Lyman Ward, Oliver's grandson. Those sections of the book seemed the most tedious to me, although I do understand their relevance.Their lives are unhappy, full of unfulfilled desires, and thus tragic. It's a haunting story that left me somewhat unsatisfied at its ending.Overall, I would recommend it for its strongest point, a sweeping view of western life in the 1880's."

4,Great transitional strengths by Stegner,"The tremendous setting of the table by the author to force the reader at the end to forecast what will happen, is overwhelming. Will Lyman be as unrelenting as Oliver seemed to be? During the writing of the history of his Grandparents, he clearly took the side of his Grandmother, for whatever the reasons. But when his own wife, who had some of the same characteristics as his Grandmother (helpless victim of love?), came to seek forgiveness, the reader is left to surmise if Lyman will welcome her back. Does this remind anyone else of ""The Lady or the Tiger"" dilemma?"
4,The Civilized West,"Although disappointed with the lack of true grit that you expect from a story set in the Western US of the 19th Century, I found myself liking th e novel.I disagree with the previous reveiwer who felt that the ending was rushed. To the contrary, I felt that Stegener ended his novel quite succintly by coming to terms with his own bitterness.The tale of Oliver and Susan Ward was one of courage, determination, and dogged stubborness. Although you admired their good qualities, each was flawed to the extent that they could not truly make each other happy. The fact that each lived so long in their emotionless state was bitter irony.I have to admit that at times I thaought I was reading a Westernized version of Edith Wharton. However, on the whole I enjoyed my few weeks with Angle of Repose."
2,Not What I Expected,Not what I had expected or my style of writing. Did not keep my interest very slow and some what boring
3,Interesting...but a little scattered,"Enjoyed it for the most part...story was a little scattered and lost me a couple of times. I also thought it ended too abruptly. When it was going good I really liked it, just didn't really think it flowed well from past to present."
5,This is one of the most important books on Western history.,"Stegner knows the West, people, and how to weave them into a fascinating historical novel. This is supposedly a true story. If you like his books, you will like Ivan Doig, too."
3,Nice writing and flow but.........,I tried twice and both times was foiled by it's monotony. It needed thinning / weeding out. It was like a slow train ride across a desert with the occasional oasis.If I ever make it to the used book store I'll see if I can find a different title by Stegner and try again.
3,I admired the source of the title of the book,"If this is the book I read about twenty years ago, then I would say it was excellent reading. The most interesting part was the title. After giving a brief history of mining, the angle of 62 degrees is the angle of repose."
5,Satisfying,"This esteemed author hardly needs my approval, but I loved this book. The story though fiction seemed very real, very honest."
5,The best of Stegner,"If you are only going to read one Wallace Stegner book, it should be this one. But better, read others (like Big Rock Candy Mountain, and Crossing in Safety) first, and save this one for last."
5,Wonderful Meal of a Book,"Angle of Repose is not a page turner and that is a good thing. Each night I looked forward to another 50 or 70 pages. Stegner's gift was to make me reflect upon the fact that history is so often presented as wars, treaties, and elections while it was also (and maybe more importantly) the day-to-day existences of people like these, who lived and moved and had their beings just like we do ourselves. A great novel which makes me want to read other works by this author. One really can't ask for more!"
4,Stegner for the first time,"I found the book to be very intriguing. Between the western descriptions, the descriptions of people were the most interesting. I found Stegner;s style to be refreshing and very personal regarding the descriptions. I agree with many other reviews that Lyman Ward's narrative was needed and welcomed. When Lyman came back into the scene I was always pleased for the break from The Wards life and you knew that it signelaed the next pahse in their life and a new personal discovery into Lymasn Ward.I found Susan after a while to be very selfish and short-sighted which was a disappointment. The hero was Oliver, he was pure and solid and under apppreciated and abused, all the requiremnets for a hero!"
2,characters have no appeal,"Reading this for a book club meeting in Sept. I just find it boring. I have not been able to get invested in any character enough to care about anything that happens to them. Every once in a while there will be a sentence that gets a ""wow"" from me but not enough to keep me reading if it weren't for my book club. In talking to another club member our reaction was the same ""there are too many good books out there I want to read to spend this much time on this book"". She had finished it and told me not to expect the ending to make me feel any differently."
2,"Great Book, but not a great edition","I read The Angle of Repose about 10 years ago in paperback format, and this year our reading group was assigned another Stegner novel, Crossing to Safety. I bought the latter in a limited edition, and I enjoyed it so much I wanted to re-read his other novel, too. Having given away my paperback version, I was looking for a hardback copy of The Angle of Repose, and the Modern Library edition came up. When I received the book, it was in excellent condition, but the Modern Library edition is cheaply done and disappointing as a hardback book. I would advise anyone looking for a quality hardback copy to look at another edition. The story, of course, is outstanding, one of the best stories about the difficulties inherent in sustaining relationships I have ever read. The book is highly recommended, but this edition is not."
2,How can this be so well received?,"After having heard so much about this book and having put it down several times over the past few years, I MADE myself read it although it was a chore from beginning to end! What a dry, poorly written book and such rave reviews! If this is a 5 star, what other junk are you reading????? I cannot believe anyone could find this anything but textbook level literature. It was true labor to finish it and I would NEVER suggest anyone to read this when there are such fine authors out there. Never-ending and dull and repetitive for almost 500 pages."
2,MILDLY INTERESTING,"I know Stegner is supposed to be a great writer and he is widely admired. But I found this novel boring and lightweight, fraught with attempts at deeper meaning that don't quite work.The content is not engaging or very interesting. I read 72 pages, and the main character, an old man in a wheelchair, is obsessed with the life of his grandmother, Susan, who carried the values he admires. The world around him is sliding downhill, morally and intellectually, so he is writing a book about Susan, to tell the world how to live. Good freakin' luck.Susan is a mildly interesting character, and her life is also mildly interesting. She was in love with some guy, and she and a girlfriend hung around with him, but he fell in love with the other woman. So she married another man. OK, but so what?I'd have to be alone on a desert island, with nothing else to read, to want to finish this book."
4,Solemn Reflections and Lives,"Not since Clarissa walked onto her steps in ""The Hours,"" have I immediately loved a character as I did Susan Ward. The life of Susan, as told by her grandson, starts out with much vibrance and excitement. But the parallel story of her grandson's life gives the story an edge- and a glimpse into why he is in pursuit of understanding (and documenting) his grandmother.The conclusion of these lives (to which we are privy) is not simple nor cheap. But it does stand apart from the rest of the novel. And it does not offer comfort- but rather a glimpse into a set of lives that might be more real than we'd like to admit."
3,Do NOT read Angle of Repose until,"Stegner left nothing on the table after ""All The Little Live Things"", his 1960s novel. Read ""Live Things"" before reading ""Angle"" and you will have a hard time getting through the latter. I have also read ""Spectator Bird,"" ""Crossing to Safety,"" and ""Bluebird Sings/Lemonade Springs"". These three and ""Live Things"" are all far better than ""Angle"", although my favorite remains ""Live Things"". I couldn't finish ""Recapitulation"" which goes over his life in Salt Lake City. ""Angle"" is tedious compared to ""Live Things"". I am a huge Stegner fan and am sorry to think that people will be turned off by ""Angle"" and quit him without reading his good stuff."
3,a 1970 Oprah selection,"I'd like to read Crossing to Safety, which another reviewer highly recommends. Stegner is a wonderful writer, but this book, Angle of Repose, is overly-long, overly-wrought, and seems to meander way too much. I'm brought back to the world of turn-of-the-century western *pioneer* fiction, but I feel that I'm at the hands of one too far removed - the grandson/narrator for me is contived and doesn't add much, except generational overtones of despair and malaise. For gripping scenes of the untamed west, visit the forgotten works of Guthrie (*The Way West*), visit Norris and his wonderful books of California. And if it's family drama you want, spend time with Tolstoy - speed up to Eugenides. As it is Angle is a book that now finished, I don't think I would ever revisit."
2,"A decent novel, but nothing to write home about.","Sorry, but I was disappointed, having read all the glowing reviews and expecting something much more. In the main, the characters were somewhat vacuous, as if they existed little more than on the surface of a history. The absence of any real spirituality or religious convictions, good or bad, was glaring in the characters, hardly anything philosophical, or even political, to ponder. As an adventure, it was only enough to keep one interested, but hardly dramatic or epic in scope. So, at the end, I said to my self, ""So what?"" I'd recommend Joseph Conrad's Nostromo for those seeking a more ingenious story of depth."
2,100 Words or Less,"The stiff construct of this novel is overwhelming.Like the character and his setting, the prose proves to be self-involved and restricted. The words thud across the page with so much leaden ""meaning"" that I simply struggle to continue. The pace is lethargic, the emotional string-pulling is typical, and it all provides little reason to continue.Maybe this novel is a victim of its era? Maybe its formula is so used by now, that I couldn't approach it with a fresh eye. Well, for whatever reason, I tried to slog forward, but to no avail. I stopped after two chapters."
5,Epic Great American Novel,"This is a masterwork of Stegner's (one of the best American novels, really). Epic story within a story of human frailty (marriage, love, failure, meaning) & life--real life-- in the beginnings of the American west, told through a descendant of the pioneering couple in late 20th century California.Stegner's prose is easy to read though quite beautiful--& stunning in some places.Like any great work, this story (themes, characters etc,) just stays with me long after I've read it.It is a longer work, but I could have easily read more if he'd written it."
5,Brilliant Author,This is a must for those who enjoy true writing at it's best. The author mesmerizes you with his stories. Read the book slowly and let the story sink in. Now this is what a reader looks for in a book!
3,"Beautifully written, a frustrating relationship","Stegner writes a richly detailed fictional biography of his narrator's grandmother, who ""built the West,"" though it was her husband who deserves that title. As in Crossing to Safety, Stegner skillfully tells the story of a marriage between a strong woman and a quiet man, but where Crossing to Safety brought me to tears, I felt only irritation at the grandmother's lack of trust in her husband throughout their lives."
3,Overrated,"As usual, compared to most contemporary fiction, this book was pretty good. But among the 100 greatest English language novels ever? Not even close. Others have given plot descriptions so I shall not repeat here but if you are an avid reader this is not one I would rush out to devour - essentially predictable, boring, annoying, but not horribly written which in itself is a treat, will most likely be a better choice than any recently written novel you may pick up but I would certainly not rush out to buy it."
2,Wallace is an acquired taste,"I got this for my bookclub. It drags on and on. I love words and descriptive sentences, but this author uses. 20.words when 5 will do"
5,excellent book,"I read this novel several years ago but I do remember how good it was. I believe it won the Pulitzer prize. Also, I remember that the author based some of the story on his own ancestor (grandmother?).Set in the American west, this is the story of a husband and wife who travel west for the husband's job in the mining industry. He is intermittently employed and the wife is a writer and illustrator and able to help support the family with her income. This makes problems for the family. It's a rich telling.EnjoyI think I'll read it again!"
4,Backup from my ab roller,This is worth having. I bought mine as a backup to the original VHS cassette I had when I bought the ab roller unit several years ago. Too bad they don't put these things out on DVD. Go figure.
1,Totally misread,FOr the price asked for I mistook this for the actual ab machine. This VHS tape cost and was listed as $34. Who still pays that much for a tape? I woud have thought this was a mistake since there was another one posted for the same tape at $9.
4,Ab Roller Review,I use this several times a week and I find it helpful in keeping my stomach muscles firm. I used it years ago and lost the tape so was happy to get a replacement.
5,hard to find replacement,I was looking for this certain video and finally found it. Amazon is great. The video was as promised and fast to ship and receive. Thanks!
2,No volume,"Contradictory to it's name, my friend who I purchased it for complained it did not give her hair any volume. She did say it made her hair very silky."
2,My first ever... return item - a real disappointment,"This is an elegantly designed, precisely made, sturdy product that looks as if it would last forever. Unfortunately, it doesn't suit me because I really, really like pepper - lots of it, very coarsely ground, and the throughput on this mill is just plain wimpy. If you like a lot of pepper on your food, or prefer your pepper not ground much further than cracked, this is not your mill."
5,"Achoo You.,","This is an awesome addition to any Frenchman's kitchen and the metal curve lacing is perfect for modern American families who are on the fringe. Using the concepts invented by the great French cook Beaumont, this pepper sprinkler uses a half cork spring valve to smash pepraka into small edible particles which are excellent for cooking on lamb roast."
1,Won't play on PowerDVD; really not DTS-HD,"This disc won't play on a computer with PowerDVD.Also, I learned from a review site that it is really just a 5.1 transfer and re-encoded to DTS-HD--quoted here: ""PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS RECORD WAS ORIGINALLY PRODUCED FOR 5.1 AND PRESENTED FOR 7.1 SURROUND SOUND REPRODUCTION TO PROVIDE YOU WITH UNIQUE ACOUSTIC REALITY EXPERIENCE."" Given that the disc size is on 6GB, this clearly could fit on a DVD. I think they are just hoping that by putting it on Blu-ray that we will think it is DTS-HD Master Audio quality. It is not."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"One of the primary reasons I ordered this blu-ray disc was for the listening experience of this relatively new medium which has been well-received in the reviews I've read. I found this recording, however, to be only average in sound quality. I found the performance to be so-so as well."
1,Most of the Blue Ray Audio in 7.1 are not worth buying - Stay away,"I bought several blue ray 7.1 channel classical music titles from Amazon in 2009-2010, none of them live up to my expection. They simply do not play all the way through and for the part that they play, the audio is well below my expection. Those purchases were a waste of money for me and may be the technology or the available recording is not yet ready? (IMHO)."
1,Would not play - altered non-standard codex?,"Caution - I just received this BD disk, and it will not play on my Samsung BD-P1500. I contacted mfg support and they told me many disks of this series are having problems and they are trying to update the codex used in the disks. They said the codex is altered, non-standard, but they will issue a firmware update soon that will at least make this disk work. I will wait to return the disk a week or so, then if there isn't a fix, I will return. NOTE: The disk will play on an older Sony BD player I have, but it is only 5.1 . This was to be one of my 7.1 trials. The disk may be a 5-star, but I can't tell you yet."
3,A mix of black and white Blues,A fine mixing of Black American and White British style of sixties Blues. JL.Hooker and T.Mcphee compliment each other superbly. A good choice of tracks recorded in London during a JL hooker tour. The set can become a little lacluster at times with few magical moments. The recording shows McPhee's musical backgound and is a must for Groundhog/McPhee fans. A good listen for anybody else into sixties black blues.
3,Funny in small doses,"It's a lot better than Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, which it spoofs, but that's not saying an awful lot. It is funny, but a lot of the jokes are lame and obvious, so it's best if you see little bits at a time, when you're in the mood.The best thing is the cast. Cary Elwes brings his whole ""Westley"" charisma from The Princess Bride, which makes for a great, charming, sarcastic Robin Hood. Richard Lewis is very funny as Prince John (he of the ever-changing mole) but by far the best is Roger Rees, hilarious as the stuttering, dyslexic Sherriff of Rottingham, whose convulsions of ridiculous fury could carry the movie alone."
2,Mediocre Brooks,"A couple of funny gags, visual and verbal, don't make up for a tired plot and some dated pop culture references. Cary Elwes is an engaging Robin and Amy Yasbeck is a comely Marian, but everyone else here has done better, especially Mel Brooks in the writing department. This is the second time Brooks has tackled the Robin Hood story (does anyone remember ""When Things Were Rotten"" on television?), but it still doesn't hold up. Perhaps some stories are so familiar they just can't be spoofed anymore. Stick to ""Young Frankenstein"", ""Blazing Saddles"", ""High Anxiety"", or ""Twelve Chairs""."
2,DISAPPOINTING COMEDY,"Weak comedy starring Mel Brooks as Robin Hood who surprisingly disappoints. The whole film simply does'nt seem to gel together, and the witless script handicapp all performances which includes Amy Yasbec and Richard Lewis (although they are all competent actors). The jokes are all old hat and it almost feels like an updated formular of the Carry On films with all its bawdy gags and predictable double entendres. It's all a matter of opinion really but for me this comedy misses its potential in a long way."
2,Lost in the Woods,"Audiences of satire films have matured a lot on such rapid-fire comedies as Airplane and Naked Gun, but, in this movie, Mel Brooks prefers heavy handed schtick designed to make sure EVERY dummy in the Cineplex has got ALL the dots joined up - phwar phwar! Nothing ruins a comedy more than having every joke hammered to death in this way. It's like he's asking, ""Have you got it, have you got it?"" before moving onto the next labored gag. Also, picking on Costner's abysmal film is a little like shooting fish in a barrel. The best way to enjoy this movie is to impair your intelligence in some way, probably by drinking half a bottle of whisky or vodka."
1,Stupid movie! Unwatchable.,"This movie is one of the stupidist movies I've ever tried to watch. My 12 year old son, who has a background in classic movies, walked out on it after 20 minutes and I left shortly afterwards. My wife lasted longer but only because she was the one who had rented it. I've seen Mel Brooks movies like Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein which are truly funny and classics,but this one is totally unwatchable. Don't waste your time!"
1,Wanted to walk out within 10 minutes,"Unfortunately, I saw this movie in the theater and paid good money to do so. I have never wanted to walk out of a movie so much in my life, this was HORRIBLE! Bad acting by actors and comedians who are trying really hard to make a bad script sound funny. Mel Brooks is really a hit or miss director. Some of his works are really hilarious, others have their moments and then there was this one. The only line I found funny in the entire movie was the line shown in the trailers "". . . only one that can speak with a proper english accent"" or whatever. I can't understand why so many people actually gave this 5 stars but everyone is free to form their own opinions."
2,"A okay comedy, but a piss poor Brooks film","Eh....not Mel Brooks' best comedy by a long shot. The jokes are uninspired, some of them are recycled ({like the camera breaking the glass gag he used in High Anxiety...which actually made sense in the latter)...hell, the song ""Men in Tights"" is the exact tune as the ""Jews in Space"" number at the end of ""History of the World, Part 1""! Seriously, did no one involved with the production think no one would wise up to that?Almost everything in this film was a joke from previous films. This could have been so much better than it was."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though Cary Elwes is perfectly cast as a self-aware Robin Hood, too much of this film's humor seems pitched at the 6th graders that Mel Brooks began targeting with 1987's Spaceballs"
5,I had heard things...,"The disk came in great quality, no issues. The movie was hilarious, and I must say, the best rendition of Robin Hood yet."
3,A Light Weight Comedy,"Fun for a few laughs. A product of the late 80's/early 90's with comedic references from that era (including MC Hammer-style rapping). A little slow paced at times, but fun if your in the mood and if you were alive during that time and will understand the references to other movies from the same period."
4,Always fun,"We simply had to buy this for my eldest daughter to save money on rentals. I don't know how many times she's watched it, and I often stop and watch it, too."
4,Silly slapstick,This is Mel Brooks at his finest. The subtle inuendos ( and some not so subtle) and small optical pranks are everywhere. It is witty and just good fun.
2,Not His Best Work -,"'Robin Hood' is basically boring, overloaded with stretched efforts for cheap jokes that fall flat. Instead of watching this, go back are watch 'Blazing Saddles' again."
5,Great Robin Hood movie.......Better than the other movies!,"I love this movie! Robin Hood is so cute in this movie! If you love comedy.....see it! If your a woman/man who likes cute men in tights.......see it! I love it!! Soooooo very funny, an adorable movie!"
5,Lots of silly fun!,"Fun for the whole family, wonderful actors with perfect timing, something for everybody.Mel Brooks did it again. (And Carey Elwes is easy on the eyes!)"
5,Fantastic classic!,"This is one of my most favorite movies ever! If you've ever seen any other Robin Hood movie, you'll enjoy laughing and making fun of it while watching this movie. Mel Brooks is genius!"
4,"Men in Tights, DVD",My daughter loves this DVD. She is a young teen. Lots of slapstick kind of humor.
2,"Way too predictable, even though I'm a Mel Brooks fan.","When I saw this movie in the theater, I thought it was great.The second time, 6 years later, I bought it and saw it on video. I could recognize all the lines and gags before I saw them, and they weren't all that funny. Some movies I love repeating the lines to and waiting in anticipation for something to happen. This isn't one of them.I'll skip my viewings of Men in Tights and just watch Blazing Saddles twice as much."
4,"Funny movie, but not Brooks' best","I got this for my birthday, and I gotta say, it's definately a comedy classic. But in my opinion, it's not Mel Brooks' best film. As I was watching it, I noticed that he took scenes from some of his other classics, and just re-vamped them for this flick. That ruined it for me. If you want to see his best work, go out and buy Space Balls."
2,An unfunny fossil,"What I'm about to say is akin to declaring the Earth is flat.Merry Men sing their signature number. How much you want to bet they'll start doing the can-can? ..Yep, there it is.""A BLACK sheriff??!!"" ..Hang on, we better explain to the audience that it's a shout-out to Blazing Saddles. Wink wink nudge nudge.Little's John's river is smaller than a toothpick. Wait! Have Chappele straddle the sides to show how tiny it is! Otherwise it'll just go over the audience's heads.Pratfalls. Pratfalls. Did I mention PRATFALLS?Dat goofy Sheriff, he talk so funny!And so on. If I can predict the joke by recalling a Loony Tunes cartoon I watched at age 6, we have a problem. It's not just this movie; a lot of comedy falls into this bracket, even now. To you, it may be classic and familiar, but to me it's depressing. The only guy comfortable here is Chappelle, and maybe Richard Lewis (a wicked fly Prince John; why would they want to depose him?). Otherwise, this was just painful to sit through."
4,Really funny.,"It's not as good as The Producers, Young Frankenstein, and Blazing Saddles but it has many, many laughs and is fun entertainment. You will laugh even more if you see the original 1938 Robin Hood movie with Errol Flynn and the 1991 version starring Kevin Costner."
4,Perfect Parody,This movie is a great parody of all the cheesey Robin Hood movies out there. It has a lot of cultural references and its humor is definetely towards the more Monty Python and Blazing Saddles side. It also has some great guest stars like Patrick Stewart and Mel Brooks. If you love dry English style comedy you will love this movie.
5,Pure Fun!!,"Totally crazy, you get caught up in the hilarity of this parody from the get-go. Definitely a must-see!"
5,Hilarious,This movie is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I wore out my VHS and hesitate to buy it in that format again as my vcr is on its last legs. I can not believe that the studio's are ripping us off by only making it available on dvd in the Mel Brooks Collection. This is outrageous. I think if they are trying to make money this way they are dropping the ball. I think more sales would come from the individual release of this film as they have done with other Mel Brooks films in that collection. STOP HOLDING OUT ON US!!!! Release it in the US on DVD so EVERYONE can enjoy it.
4,Very good Mel Brooks.,"This movie has many very funny parts. Some of it is just not classic Brooks, but it is well worth watching."
5,What can I say...?,"For any and all Mel Brooks fans, this is a must have! Blinken, Achoo, John, and Rabbi Tuckman are wonderful characters to the gorgeous Cary Elwes as Robin Hood. Don't miss the title song... the kick line is hilarious! If you love Princess Bride, Spaceballs, Blazing Saddles... then this is right up your alley. I'm so glad this finally came out on DVD!"
5,Beautifull absolutely beautifull,Marvelouse I rally laughed my brains out. I realy hope you watch this movie.
4,NICE....CANT COMPLAIN :-),I personally like classic Brooks films. But this is an exception! Well I found it amusing-very funny.
3,"Childhood nostalgia, but objectively not that strong","If you saw this film as a child, as I did, it might be a very good idea to buy it. I had a lot of fun remembering all the dialogues and situations. Some jokes are excellent (eg. ""Abe Lincoln!"") and certain scenes still work for an adult audience (eg. the Godfather scene), but most of it is really childish and silly. You have to be in the right mood for this one."
4,I liked it but....,"I liked the movie but when I received it, it was not attached to case it was off the box and it got a tiny scratch on it. I still really enjoyed it. Thank you"
5,Achoo!!!!,"I still consider this to be one of the funniest movies ever. Mel Brook once again shows off his silly play-on-words humor and I think he peeked out on this one. One thing I like about Mel Brook films, including this one is he places the humor throughout while still keeping a good story line. He is not over-the-top and somewhat annoying like the makers of the Scary Movie series can be.Cary Elwes was the perfect choice for playing a comedy based Robin Hood with his silly but not overly done mannerisms (his acting is similar to how he was in The Princess Bride). The characters are hilarious. I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a good laugh and who like silly, put well played out humor. If you liked Spaceballs you will probably like this movie."
4,Funny but not gut-busting,"Men In Tights is a great parody of a slightly-above-average movie. Most of the funniest parts of Men In Tights are the 1990s cultural references that have nothing to do with the Robin Hood association. Definitely worth seeing, but not one that I would watch frequently. I loved Tracey Ullman as Latrine, and Brunhilde is hilarious in every scene. The Everlast-branded chastity belt is just one example of a tremendous amount of sight gags that are hilarious. This movie is trademark Mel Brooks, but it doesn't break the fourth wall as much as say, Blazing Saddles, which I feel is a strong point for Men In Tights."
5,Another classic from Mel Brooks,"This movie has got to be another one of Mel Brook's classics. Practically all of his movies are! This movie has got comedy, romance, action, drama, and did I mention comedy? It's a great movie that I believe everyone will enjoy! Worth the price of purchase for $9.99!"
4,robin hood men in tights,"pretty funny movie, some jokes were a little lame, but all in all a good viewing experience. too bad its not on dvd yet"
3,ROBIN HOOD MEN IN TIGHTS,"""WE'RE MEN, WE'RE MEN IN TI-IGHTS. WATCH WHAT YOU SAY OR ELSE WE'LL PUNCH OUT YOUR LIGHTS..."" I THINK THAT SONG SAYS IT ALL... THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE IF YOU LIKE MEL BROOKS AND IF YOU LIKE A DIFFERENT KIND OF ""FUNNY"". I WATCH THIS MOVIE QUITE OFTEN AND STILL LAUGH.(AND THERE IS A YOUNG DAVE CHAPPELL AS ROBIN HOODS SIDE KICK...) YOU CANT BE TOO DISSAPPOINTED WHEN YOU BUY A MEL BROOKS ANYTHING."
4,Almost one of Brooks' best parodies,"Yeah, it ain't ""Blazing Saddles"" but then that's like comparing anything else Leonardo painted to ""Mona Lisa."" This is a funny, funny film with a great cast, headed up by Cary Elwes who despite looking like a handsome leading man, can carry off humor with incredible skill. Why don't we see more of him? He's great. The rest of the cast is fantastic, and the cameo Brooks role of Rabbi Tuckmann, purveyor of sacramental wine is one of his best. He's one of the few directors who can make a cameo more than just a walk-on vanity.This is always fun for a rainy day rental and after seeing all the second-rate serious Robin Hood films, it makes a welcome parody."
5,"Master, you lost your arms in battle??!!!","Absolutely the funniest movie ever, you will want to watch it over and over again! For some weird reason DVD version is only available in Europe, you can buy it from [UK website] (your DVD player should be capable of playing Region2 PAL DVDs)"
3,A funny movie,"A little crazy, but this movie is entertaining and sometimes very funny lines. A ""fun"" watch some evening with family."
5,Call a locksmith!,"I prepurchased this DVD because I'd been waiting so long for it to come out. (I still have my VHS version). I've loved this movie since the first time I saw it as a child. The great thing about it is every time you watch it you catch new jokes. Cary Elwes gives his best performance to date as the charming, witty Robin Hood who, ""unlike some other Robin Hoods"", can speak with an English accent. From start to finish this movie will have you laughing. Mel Brooks even makes an appearance as the flippant Rabbi Tuckman. This is not a movie to miss."
3,This movie is okay. Not as funny as Mel Brooks' other films.,"This movie is okay, it has too many stupid parts that aren't funny but it has enough of them to be satisfying in the end. This film may not be as good as Mel Brooks' other films, but its definitely worth checking out. 7.5/10"
2,Quick N Dirty Job,"Have read 40% of the book so far. There are many places where visual aspects are discussed, and there are no visual illustrations!!. The book is clearly aimed at people whose knowledge is elementary in the areas being discussed, and yet there is no attempt to make it easy for the reader to learn. Also, the examples are unimaginative.On the bright side, I like the casual conversational style."
3,Behind the scenes of the movie,"I was curious to see what Mary Meigs wrote about my favorite movie. It was an easy read and told a bit more about the women involved in the movie, their lives and what happened to them in later years. The movie actually needs no further explanations if you view it for whatever message you see in it."
5,Each Character is a jewel In the Company of Strangers,"One of the best movies ever. It is a jewel, and should bewatched again and again. The humanity of these womenfar outweighs the loose plot. What's a plot anyway whenthe characters are the moving force in a drama. I wouldrecommend this movie to any thoughtful moviegoer."
2,"It was good, but not stop my heart good.","I kept waiting for the book to really get started and I feel it just never happened. This is my first book by this author and it will probably be my last. Save your money, if you need to try it, get it from the library or a friend."
5,"A Subtle, Beautiful Love Story","Either Sebastien ""clicks"" with readers or he doesn't. If he dosen't, those readers found the story to be slow. But for those readers like myself who were drawn to him from the beginning, Sebastien was the perfect hero. (He didn't have a silly line anywhere.) Since I did like him so well I found everything about this book endearing and interesting. I hated to see it end. I loved Sebastien's humble ways, I loved the way he respected the elder clan members, and respected Alainna as a clan leader; he never once doubted her ability to lead a clan (although she never actually ""led"" her clan in my opinion). Sebastien was the perfect man."
5,An Adorable Hero,"Sebastien was one of those hero's where only a look or gesture can melt a woman's heart. He was so handsome and very nice, just a great guy. This book was slow in a good way. I like the way the author took her time with him, although we all know that this method doesn't always work for a lot of her books, but isn't that due to the attractiveness, or lack of, of the hero?"
3,"Nice story, but boring!","As a heavyweight (no, not my dress size) in the romance readers dept. I must say that I don't understand all the high praise this book has received. I went out and bought it because of all the great reviews. Sure there are some wonderful moments, the male lead is interesting, the setting full of promise....so why was I so bored? This book is very easy to put down."
2,"Sweet, but Boring","I thought that the romance between the two main characters was cute, but this book was so boring! The accuracy from this time was awesome, but all the talk of the stone carving almost made me fall asleep. The writing was fine, the characters well written, but I like books with more humor or action in them. This was a snooze for me."
1,Painful........,"I have never really given a bad book review, so here goes, this is my first.THIS BOOK WAS SO BAD; I WAS IN ""PAIN"" FROM READING IT.I have run across some badly written books in my time. But this one takes the cake. It was just too slow and nothing ever happen (nothing). I have to put it down half through the book. I couldn't take it any more. If you are brave enough to read this book, then by all means go ahead. But I told you so."
2,disappointed,"We bought this knife set for our own use. However, it's been six months minimal use and the paring knife broke just broke right in half. The copper handles are wearing off from wash. Very disappointed."
3,Sharp but Slippery,"I liked this set of knives, but the copper handles are sometimes hard to hold on to. The knives themselves are very sharp, including the top portion of the blade, if you're not careful you can cut yourself while chopping. Nice value for the price."
3,Okay for price,"Good price, but unfortunately have a couple of problems. First, the set I received is not that sharp. The company could have done a much better job sharpening them. Second, they will start rusting if washed in the dishwasher. Otherwise an inexpensive set of all metal knives."
4,Good Value,"I ordered these assuming they wouldnt cut like my set of Wustof Classic knives and was hoping they would be adequate for everyday use and that the steak knives would do the job. I was pleasantly surprised that the knives were better then I had hoped, though still far short of the wustof knives-which is to be expected at the price. Still, they are attractive and hold a fairly sharp edge. I am pleased and you will be also."
4,Ok for the price,"...It is true that they are not the sharpest or highest quality knives. But for that price they cut well enough and they look fantastic hanging in my kitchen. I only use them occasionally and for my purposes they are well worth what I paid. However, if you plan to use them daily and/or don't care what they look like, there are much better choices."
2,Too bad looks aren't everything,"While this set of knives does look pretty cool (and for that reason alone, I've rated them as worthy of two stars, vs. none). They were not even remotely sharp upon arrival-I was able to run my finger across any one of the blades without having fear of injury. Right then I should've sent them back, but my failure to do so has understandably left me ""stuck"". Even so, my opinion would've been somewhat positive if they could be quickly sharpened by using the steele included, or else if they held an edge once sharpened, but that's not the case ... not by any stretch of optimistic imagination. Fortunately, they were obtained at half price during a Yahoo sale; if not for that, I'd be thoroughly disgusted."
2,Disappointing,"The only reason these knives get two stars is because they are beautiful looking knives. Unfortunatly, they are not very useful. Out of the box these knives are dull. VERY DULL. Dull knives are extreamly dangerous because there is a greater tendancy to slip off the food your trying to cut and so begins an accident. Try dicing an onion with a dull knife. The sharpening steel can not sharpen a blade this dull. They would require the services of a professional knife sharpener. I am going to exchange this set for a new one. Perhaps I just got a bad set."
3,Not all that glitters....,"I purchased these knives because I desperately needed a new knife set. I really liked the all metal design and the shiny copper handles, and they did look like they would be sharp. To my surprise the knives were so dull I had to sharpen them right away!!Overall I am happy they look nice in my kitchen and I got them for a steal ...!! I would not recommend buying these if your'e looking to invest in a good set of knives. I think you do get what you pay for. Don't be fooled by the way they look.I just have to say after using WUSTHOF grand prix. These knives are just for decoration!!! If you cook everyday like me DO NOT buy these. Because I could not afford to buy a full set of WUSTHOF, I just bought the 7"" inch santoko knife and have had it for 2 years now. That is the only knife I have in my kitchen, you get the rest. It will slice paper like those corny commercials.lol! Don't waste your $$$."
4,A good value for the price,"I've had the Sabatier Copper 11 piece knife set and block for about a week and have been very happy with the performance. I really like the copper handles. They are solid/heavy feeling and seem to be a good fit in your hand. They also go nicely through the dishwasher. I know there are better knife sets out there for more $$, but I didn't want to spend a fortune. Count me as a satisified customer!"
2,"Okay for couples...""ify"" for the general public","After watching this DVD, I can safely say that with the exception of couples massage in the privacy of your own home, that most (if not all) regulated states would never allow the routine shown to be done for the public. The draping was horrible, one of the therapists had long hair that wasn't tied back (was touching the client's skin),and some of the longer strokes down the back and up the legs were extended underneath the towel/blanket. The Esalen Institute is based in California where there obviously aren't strict ethical boundries established...as say in..NY where I'm licensed. A few of the strokes might be adapted for massage to the public however. The only good thing I can really comment on is the scenery...if you're thinking about designing a garden or deck to do outdoor massage, you might get some decorating ideas. All in all, I'd rate it a 2 out of 5 stars."
2,Not for couples,"It's tough to rate this one because I was specifically looking for intimate massage. The setting is breathtaking, but the presentation is more professional how-to or ""travel destination"". Nothing intimate or arousing for two people in the privacy of their own home, but they may consider actually going to Esalen for a getaway."
5,Good pretzels for dip!,"I'm trying to save money with alp few subscribe and save deals on amazon and I thought I'd give these a whirl and make my own smaller packs for toddler snacks on the road. Theyre the oerfect size for my guy- he enjoys them daily. They're my favorite because I like to dip food in other food and these waffle-type pretzels offer a ton of surface area for my dipping needs.As another reviewer said, a pretzel is a pretzel- but these are good. Oh! And 20 to a serving size! That's a nice little snack!"
4,Cheap price gets an extra star on this one...,"This CD is kind of a sampler for the famous a cappella singers, so it has a little jazz, gospel, folk and Christmas mixed in with the classical tracks. On some they sing the words, although the group became famous more than 40 years ago for singing only the notes. Either way, there is a lot of talent displayed. I was a fan early on, buying several of their Phillips LP's, but my favorite was always their Christmas record. For unknown reasons, that one, singing the notes to a couple of dozen carols in medleys, has never been fully and faithfully transferred to compact disc. Some of my friends find the Swingles style irritating, but I think more of their selections are just full-out lovely. Buy this as an introduction, because their work on CD usually is a bit pricey."
4,Not all traditional,"Nice music, but it's not all traditional (unless you consider the Peter Gunn TV show traditional). Not all songs are the wordless acapella I expected, but they are all well done."
5,Excellent Product,"Very good product at an unbeatable price. I originally bought it because it was the only wireless keyboard I could find that retains the original U.S. layout without the gratuitous and a ridiculous changes to the centre keypad that have been foisted on us by Microsoft and Logitech. Having acquired it at less than half the price of the competing and unsatisfactory products from the big producers, I am now a happy and satified user. This is the second one that I have bought"
1,I Hate Wasting Money,"...The book did not grasp on abuse like I thought it was and then it goes on to help you realize that the husband was nothing but a crackhead. In the beginning the author Marlene Taylor lead you to believe that he was going crazy, but his craziness was induced by drugs. ... Drugs do make you do crazy things, but if you were sober and drug-free you most likely would not do these things...."
5,"If You Like Wacthing the ""Lifetime"" Channel,","If you like watching the ""Lifetime"" channel, you will love reading this book. I'm glad i read the book because it gave me more in sight on why some men are abusive to their wives/girlfriends. I believe there are a lot of naive women in this world just like Tuesday and this book is a wake up call for all. I really enjoyed reading this book and i recommend it to all who enjoy reading and watching Lifetime *smile*. I just have two questions tho. Who pushed GB down the steps? and What or who was in the crawl space when Tuesday's Brother heard the noise? I hope Marlene does a continuation to this book...."
5,Phenomenal work!,"I felt compelled to write this review of Marlene Taylor's A Silver Tongue. The moment I finished her novel I was eager to congratulate her for her best work yet.I quickly noticed an evident maturation in her composition techniques in comparision to those of her first novel. This is in no way to mar or detract from her former novel, Life Is What You Make You It, Darlin', but to instead applaud her latest piece of work. Her choice of narrative, plot development, character and location depiction, especially the little voice, make it all so realistic and familiar.Marlene Taylor captures with perfect detail some of society's most destructive entities. Drugs, obsession and infidelity are are shown to be key destroyers of our working and middle class. Very well done Ms. Taylor, I couldn't put down your book and I eagerly await your next."
3,Good but not great,This is a good book. The author got to the point very quickI wish the book was a little longer but other than minorflaws this is a must buy.
4,crazy,"this book was really good. i'm still trying to figure out what ""a silver tongue"" has to do with anything, but this was a page turner for me. there were some twists, but the way it ended blew my mind!"
3,A Bit hammy,OK its just about watchable but it suffers alot from wooden and amateuristic acting.The story is watchable and it would be of interest to those interested in the Shaver mystery
1,Worst movie ever,"I sat through this boring, amateurishly made ""film"" only because I was dared to. A random collection of ideas and concepts from Shaver, Lovecraft, Christianity, Fort and many more all presented badly and performed by some incredibly terrible actors. I think even Richard Shaver would be embarrassed by this. Yes, there are some scenes that hit that ""so bad they're funny"" level, but not nearly enough to counterbalance the endless exposition and scenes of people slowly wandering around. Did I mention the narrators creepy drawl? This is Youtube quality video presented as a real film. The Shaver Mystery deserves better than this.TERRIBLE!!!"
4,New Boston star,"A very laid back Album, very easy on the ear, definately a star in the making.Very dificult to package a little bit folky and a little bit country roots/americana, very bare sound just a lot of voice, and little bit of guitar and drums very nice indeed especially later in the day after a bad day at work, relaxing music for adults."
5,"Good concise and from what I can tell, well researched history","While not an exhaustive history, this book does give a very well written and concise history of the Knights Templar. It also has an appendix covering the fate of the order, as well as some of the myths about where its members ended up after their suppression by the Church."
4,Good product,"Have a generator that had cheap Chinese tubes. Valve stems ripped out. These replacement tubes, although also made in China seem to be of reasonable quality. Time will tell"
2,not enough football,"I am disappointed with this item. It seemed to me that less than half of the time was video highlights and instead we get a bunch of talking heads, interview out takes, etc. I won't waste any more of my money on NFL Films items unless I know for sure it's wall to wall football and not video of how Tim Rossovich lives on the beach or Dickie Post runs his clothing business, or endless minutes wasted on player interview out takes that are pointless. VERY BORING!! The best part of this DVD was the 1962 NFL Championship game. That was worth watching. Most of the rest is boring."
2,cw,Customer service is one of the best out there but the watch looked a little out of date. Over all ok but Iv'e had better
1,WACK!,"Well it was cheap, what do you expect? This watch lasted only for 2 days before it started falling apart. Atlest for 20 bucks it could have just lasted for one week! Common folks! Be realistic, if you are trying to buy this watch, give the money to charity. it will be more valuable!!!!"
5,Good stuff!,"This is a very nice collection of some of Dar's best creations, performed with passion and energy. It also includes some samples of the amusing and witty concert banter that she delivers between songs. An added bonus is the voice of Gail Ann Dorsey, which blends beautifully with Dar's in such songs as ""Better Things."" As an attendee at one of the concerts where the album was recorded, I am pleased to see the enthsiasm of both the artist and the fans reflected here."
3,"good, but far below what she could have accomplished","In just a few short years Ms. Williams has gotten herself the support of a big mangement company behind her, but frankly Dar's magic comes out of an acoustic guitar. Sure, it's great the AGF people were able to get some top-notch studio/session players to join her on the road, but that's exactly what you are hearing. Hired hands being paid to do a job, period. From the reports I've heard she should have cut a live album with the folks that are touring with her now to, ironically, support this album."
3,"She's amazing, but...","I first discovered Dar at a concert in Snowmass Village, near Aspen Colorado. I had never heard of her in my life, being from Australia, but I went along anyway and was completely mesmerized! From ""Iowa"" to ""What do you hear in these sounds"" I couldn't believe her cool, honest lyrics and voice. I got ""The end of the summer"" and love it, but the live album wasn't so great--I recommend her others, as each wonderful song is given more clarity in her other albums."
5,The best,"I don't understand why some people say these songs don't sound as great live. Sure, they sound different than on Dar's studio albums, but in my opinion, they sound BETTER!!!Dar is a great song writer, and for any fan, especially one just starting to listen to her music, it's a must-have. I've burned it for a lot of music fans I know, and most of them love it too!Stand out song for me is February, but they are all great. You seriously will be hard-pressed to find a song you don't like."
4,Better Live,This is a great CD for Dar fans. She sounds so much better live. I might even toss my older studio-recorded CDs.
5,Good taste of Dar...,"If you have not had the honor to see Dar Williams live, get this CD. It not only showcases how wonderful she plays, but on a few tracks it shows us how cute she is inbetween songs. The CD lets us hear her explain the background to a few songs including ""The Babysitter's Here.""If you have seen her, still get this baby and relive fond memories."
5,A romantic love story,"From the beginning, Elinor married an old man Arthur, she was there for him till the end. But her desire for Luce was so romantic I loved that romance. If you love romance in an exciting way this book is it. Anita Mills is a very good writer. Her writing goes back to the 1800's. Falling Stars is the next book to read. Two thumbs up!!!!"
1,PRE-FAB,"Caitlin has finally come undone. ""While You Weren't Looking"" is another pre-fab recording full of lifeless lyrics wrapped in uppity pop beats. So much so, the childish attempts to wrap some kind of deep meaning in her music lyrics seem irrelevant."
5,Heart and Soul,"Caitlin Cary's new release flies in under the radar and blows you away with heartfelt alternative/country ballads in an exceptional recording.She shared the stage with Whiskytown's, Ryan Adams, and after you listen to the disc, you quickly realize she was the heart and soul of the band. Add the recording and production genius of former DB, Chris Stamey, and the albumn soars. Three tracks stand out: shallow heart, shallow water; what will you do and thick walls down.This is one of the best recording's I have heard in a long time and the sad thing is, it won't get any airplay and get missed. Do yourself a favor and buy it today. You will not be disappointed."
1,VERY VERY POOR,"Ms. Cary's performance here can only be summed up with two words- VERY POOR. From begining to end this endless stream of pop country simplicity defies any logical connection to decent music. Surely, ""Please Don't Hurry Your Heart"" ranks as one of the most pitiful attempts at music in a long long time. "" Shallow Heart, Shallow Water"" is not far ahead either. Ms. Cary's intense arrogance, immaturity, and lack of craft is prevelant here. One so full of herself has never made such bad songs. Warning- if Ms. Cary happens to knock on your door with a free copy of this mess- tell her to leave immediately..."
3,Good if not unique,"A lovely clean vocal delivery is perhaps the refreshing quality this recording has. Otherwise, though I must admit enjoying a few listens, I know that I have a dozen good records with very similar arrangements and structure, dating back to 1976. It's a good structure, so I can't really knock it, but if these little stars are to mean anything, I must knock off a few for lack of ingenuity, and in my opinion, for the occasional self-conscious lyric."
4,Please take a look,"If you like country, folk, rock and pop music-you'll like this. If you like a sweet voice, smart lyrics, musical arrangements that are just right you'll like this. The songs deliver some serious messages about co-dependancy, not seeing reality, family troubles, resisting committment, and wallowing in self-pity delivered with such beautiful singing and musical arrangements that they seem upbeat, more like a little nudge instead of a kick in the head. It's obvious that a lot of work went into this cd to get it just right, but it never sounds over produced. Favorite songs include Thick Walls Down, Too Many Keys, Plese Don't Hurry Your Heart, and I Ain't Found Nobody Yet. Pretty good disc!"
3,Just average,"I wanted to like this a whole lot more than I do. I love her work with Whiskeytown, but the songwriting here is average at best. I just picked it up again after a few weeks and still feel the same. This reminds me of a Syd Straw record: great voice, unremarkable songs."
3,Mildly Engaging Debut of Whiskeytown-alum,"Caitlin Cary and Ryan Adams were both the vital members of Whiskeytown. This is Caitlin's full-fletched debut solo-album, and it is pretty good. Of course, it invites comparisons to Ryan's post-Whiskeytown solo output (""Heartbreaker"" and ""Gold"") and this album simply isn't as good.The opener ""Shallow Heart, Shallow Water"" is an uptempo, uplifting, almost radio-friendly track. ""Fireworks"" (unlike Ryan's ""Firecracker""!) is a mellow, country-like track, with Caitlin prominent on her trademark violin. Mike Day, also of (latter day) Whiskeytown, co-wrote some and plays on most of the songs, the best being ""Pony"" and ""The Fair"", staying closer to Whisleytown's country-flavored origins.The initial pressings of the album come with a 4 song bonus CD, the most notable track being ""The Battle"", co-written and co-sung by Ryan. Overall, a nice album, but it's so hard to not compare with Ryan Adams' sublime post-Whiskeytown albums..."
5,Great western...best I've read in a long time,"Wow...this book has it all, gunfights, rustlers, beautiful cowgirls, you name it.By the way, another reviewer said he was Doc Holliday and claimed to have shot Ringo. Not likely, Ringo's wound wasn't in the back. T Ringo"
1,PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$$$$$,"You think your buying a great book about him, instead you don't. You don't get the early part of his life and or the later either. It's just a way to throw your $$$$$$ down the drain"
4,A favorite CD,"The poetry on this CD is gently evocative of meloncholy memories that most listeners can relate to. But it is the captivating voice of the reader, Thorsten Kaye, that invites many listening moments."
1,Shallow Poetry - Mediocre Presentation,"Money would be better spent elsewhere. Though the poetry by Dorothy Bridges is a touching tribute to her husband, Kaye's poetry is lacking in depth and creativity. It is obvious that Kaye is a novice at the written word, as is also evidenced by the sparse number of poems included in the book. At many times during the brief read, I got the impression that Kaye simply forced himself to hammer out poems to get the ""book"" finished. Perhaps a longer time spent studying the genre, or adding more substance to both the poems and the volume would improve the book. The presentation of the book itself is equally as mediocre. Clearly, minimum standards were met in cover art, binding, and paper selection. If Kaye puts forth another poetic effort, one would hope that a more professional eye will be given to the packaging details of the book. I looked forward to reading the book, and am very disappointed to have to write a less than complimentary review."
2,customer Service,"Even though the brush does not work as well as I had hoped, the customer service from the sender 360Living, was outstanding!!"
4,A reasonable purchase,My cell. phone battery died But Amazon came to my rescue @ a very reasonable price & a quick delivery & good quality.
1,Why Do Only Males Tell It Like It Was?,"I returned the book because of the twelve sermons, NOT ONE is from a female viewpoint. Even the Esther text quotes Morddecai instead of Esther! David Rogne has a good idea but I suggest female prachers avoid buying the book until he revises it and includes at least six female voices!"
4,Very pleased,"I was very pleased with the performance of this cookware. Very lightweight, compacts easily for packing, and provided good, even heating for cooking. Sturdy and more heavily-bottomed than I anticipated for the weight and price. I used this over myColeman PefectFlow 1-Burner Stove, so can't vouch for it over an open fire, as I haven't tried it. But, so long as you're hot placing on hot coals (i.e., using it on a grate), I believe it will hold up just fine. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is, you cannot leave the removable handle on the pot/pan while you are cooking with it. It changes the balance and makes the cookware ""side heavy."" I was afraid my pan would fall off the burner and hurt someone. Also, remember to pack a hot pad orLodge Red Leather Gloves, as it gets hot. All in all, pleased with the performance, and recommend to others."
3,smaller than I thought,I once owned a Coleman camping set than I can no longer find and wanted. This is nice with the outside finish and Teflon coating but much smaller than I visualized. It will be OK for just a couple camping but not much use for a family. I won't know how well it stands up until I use it awhile and I would NOT use it on a campfire.
4,~Rockin~,"Im not into soundtracks, only because there are usually only a few good songs & artists on them,, BUT This soundtrack outdoes the others, if your into just a few of these artists you will see how great the others are. I can honestly say when i got this soundtrack it didnt leave my cd player for a good month"
3,Ummm..,"This isn't a fantastic CD. Most of the songs on it are tolerable-your average rock that you would hear if you switched on the radio. The best track is Blink 182's ""All the Small Things"". I also like Uncle Kracker's rendition of ""Time After Time"". Also among the better tracks are ""Holiday in my Head"" and ""Never Let You Go"". Make sure you do research on the songs and see if you like them before you buy this CD."
3,"""Know My Name"" Rocks","I don't know about any of the other songs on the album, but ""Know My Name"" by Kool Keith is real tight. It is kind of funny to see underground rap. . .psycho overlord Keith on a CD full of pop. Especially when you consider how childish and stupid the movie looked."
4,NON-GREASY MOISTURIZER,"Dry skin doesn't have to be slathered with grease for moisturizing to take place. This is a non-greasy potion with Lecithin and Aloe Vera Gel.For over 44 years California based Jason Natural Cosmetics has offered natural alternatives to chemically synthesized products. During that period of time they have also followed vegetarian and vegan philosophies.Today, their product line has been redesigned and manufactured with 70 - 100% Certified Organic ingredients."
3,"Great song, weak CD single","""Breaking Up The Girl"" is one of the few BEAUTIFULGARBAGE tracks that I don't skip past. It's a great number that should have been released as the album's first single, in my opinion. But I would save your hard-earned cash for the full album instead of ""Breaking Up The Girl 1"". ""Candy Says"" is one of Garbage's weakest B-sides, and carries an unhealthy ""So Like A Rose"" vibe (a song from BEAUTIFULGARBAGE which, while blah, is still better than ""Candy Says""). And the techno remix of ""Breaking Up The Girl"" is a 10-minute snoozer. This single's saving grace is the ""Breaking Up The Girl"" video, rendered in high video and sound quality. If you're a hardcore fan, pick ""Breaking Up The Girl 1"" up....but otherwise, steer clear."
3,A good book to start using Linux,Good start for beginners who want to learn to explore the free world of Linux operating systems.
2,Limited Usefulness,"This item seems to work with the salt that comes in it - it isn't very coarse. But, as mentioned by another reviewer (that I should have read first!) it doesn't work on Pink Himalyan. The product directions packed with the product, but not mentioned online, list a lot of things including Pink salt that it should not be used with.The quality doesn't seem to me to be as advertised because there is very little selection possible on the fineness of the salt when grinding it - even with the salt that accompanied the unit. It will not grind as coarsely as common table sale, for example. Virtually no adjustment to the coarseness of the grind.For me, this item proved to be useless. If you get it - be certain to use nothing larger than a medium sized salt in it - coarse just won't work."
1,Grinding to a Stop,"I have one for pepper and one for large crystal salts. I have found they are hard to turn at all, many times.Also, the top nob used for adjustment is so loose the thing won't work at all. When I used either of thesemills/grinders I have to spend time tightning the adjustment nob between each turn.There has got to be something better than this. It is a bit embarrassing when guests are watching."
3,Lacks power for some salts,"I'm having a tough time using this product with Himalania pink crystal salt. It may work fine with ordinary sea salt, but I purchased the clear acrylic mill mainly to show off the cool pink color of the world's best salt (in my opinion, of course...).I've loosened the nut at the top to get a coarser grind, and it doesn't seem to work. It's surprising, since Peugeot is known for being the best choice in salt and pepper mills. My guess is that is just isn't robust enough for anything but conventional salt.Still, it's an attractive item, a good size, and seems like a good value - but I'm still going to end up buying the salt grinder that Himalania packages with their salt, since I know that one works - and looks almost identical."
1,Read those reviews,"The other reviewers were absolutely correct. Although the pepper mill is great, the salt mill is worthless. Note the chefs on cooking shows: they always use a pepper mill and always take a smidgeon of salt from a bowl."
1,Won't work on any salt!,The nut on top loosens & must constantly be readjusted. For it to work at all. I have to readjust the nut on top & shake it up & it works for about 2 turns. Very frustrating & end up using regular salt shaker! The pepper mill works find but the salt gets an F. Do not order this item.
4,"Get a grip, you idiots!","Sure, Pac-Man may be a ball now, but that is his new look! Take a look at Pac-Man World 1, 2, 3, and Rally, and the rest of the Pac-Man games that came after this!"
3,The Umberto Eco segment,"Umberto Eco comes to talk with Charlie Rose about his new novel, 'The Island of the Day Before'. Eco the author of the worldwide bestseller, ' The Name of the Rose' is also one of the most well-known intellectuals in the world. Unfortunately speaking English is not one of his skills. It is very difficult to understand the broken half- sentences he mumbles. Also he just is not very interesting in talking about the novel. One remark only I found worthwhile. He when asked about how he is researching the work, he said that there are 'infinite ways to research. It can be just looking. For instance the cloud I see. I can describe this."" Eco also talks about the International Date line, celebrating two New Years very close to one another.For this interview Charlie Rose should have perhaps learned to speak Italian."
2,how,how can you get the engine to work on the main game all I can get is for them to work on the explore route section
3,Does not fit 1/2 size violin,"Bought this for my daughter as she was starting violin. With her tiny 1/2 size violin, I didn't want to spend a lot of money on buying a Kuhn rest or another expensive one as she will end up going up another size soon. So I opted for this one. It's a descent rest and I've used this brand before BUT my only problem was that it doesn't fit a 1/2 size as it states and is too big. It seems like it's more a 3/4. The only way we could make it fit was to bend the legs in a bit, but even then, it would still fall off all the time. Ended up buying an adjustable rest and keeping this one for when she moves up a size as a back up."
5,Outstanding,"This album is a must have for any fans of natural horn or period performances. Clark's playing, especially in the Brahms Trio, is outstanding. I prefer this rendition of the Brahms over any on modern instruments."
3,A bit disappointed,The first and last books in this series are definately the best ones. The middle two books left me feeling cheated. There's hardly any character development and no physical descriptions! I don't think I'll be buying anymore Judy Christenberry books.
1,way out of date.,not a very good book not good photo copied pages. i could have done this at home. whatch out people
4,Shashi Tharoor's Nehru-A good read,"This is a very good book for those who do not know much about Nehru. Mr. Tharoor's style is simple and brings out the essential facts in a simple understandable manner. People who know more about Nehru may take issue with him as they might feel he is too kind towards him. But, this book I think is factual and certainly not a scholarly work as Mr. Tharoor himself mentions. I liked it."
2,Thin.,"Hits all the high points. Tharoor's occasional protestations of objectivity about Nehru ring hollow; this book is objective only in tone. Nehru's contradictions are glossed over as if merely a source of amusement, but Jinna is treated as a pathological cynic, and the British are alternately inept and reactionary. Tharoor's treatment of Churchill is as harsh as it is shallow. This book reads very quickly, and is good for people who want a quick bio of Nehru. For people who want a real examination of the man, look elsewhere."
5,So may amazing bands packed into one CD,"You can not go wrong with this CD - nor the price of this CD. The Handpicked CD features artist that have an amazing future in music. Pick up this CD, check out the songs, and then check out your local ""creative loafing"" and you will see at least two bands are touring in your area soon. CATCH THEM LIVE WHILE THEY ARE STILL PLAYING YOUR LOCAL CLUBS! In other words- catch 'em before they blow up on the music scene.To name a few: Jump lil Children, Hobex, THE MEAT PUPPETS, Johnny Irion.The guys in Hottie have surprised me with their excellent taste!Handpicked is a bargain buy ! Highly recommended!"
3,An OK Sequel,"This sequel to the incredible ""Butcher's Boy"" is classic Perry. It involves an extended travel, continuous pursuit, detailed descriptions of the settings, and considerable, mostly believable carnage.While ""Dogs"" is entertaining and suspenseful, it lacks the unique twist of ""Butcher's Boy"" wherein the reader finds himself rooting for someone who otherwise would be the bad guy.It's an exicting read, but lacks the unique twist of its predecessor."
4,Great follow up,"This is a great follow up to the butcher's boy. Takes you much deeper into this shocking individual that you wind up rooting for in all the mayhem that ensues. A good read, worth the time and money."
5,I am a big fan of Thomas Perry,"Need I say more, I have all the books he has wiritten and he is one author who I re-read his books over and over.."
5,Action filled fun,"It's hard to be an aging hit man who just wants to retire. However, his past won't let him. But, as before, the Butcher Boy doesn't miss a beat. Best if series is read in order."
1,Butchered Boy!,"I loved the Butcher's Boy and The Informant. However, this middle book in the trilogy is a bore and a total waste of time. Life is too short to have to plow through drek like this."
2,inexcusable mistake,"i stopped reading and lost all respect for the author early in the book when after shooting the greaseball in his ny restaurant the hero goes to wash off the gunshot residue with soap and water. he just washes his hands and forearms.every child knows that gsr traces adhere to clothes, hair, the face etc. so here we have a professional assassin looking like a rank amateur. not really convincing"
5,Multiple uses for this great DVD!,"The DVD is great. Beautiful beach scenery and minimal graphics. Perfect for setting the mood in your home when you need to relax.I actually bought the DVD because I'm in a Jimmy Buffett cover band. ( www.cedarreeferband.com ) One bar we play at has a huge screen TV on stage behind where I put my drums. We turn it off when we play but I figured there's gotta be something better than playing in front of a big blank screen. Much of Buffett's music is about the beach, the vacation mindset, and the distant locations that many of us long for. This DVD is the perfect backdrop for the music and vibe we put out during our performances. It's gorgeous, yet it's not busy so it isn't distracting. The creative uses for this beautiful DVD are only limited by your own imagination!"
4,Take me away!,"Feeling depressed? Feeling overwhelmed at your job? Feeling those wintertime woes? Then this is THE DVD for you! Whenever you feel like getting away from it all, push play and you are instantly in the Bahamas! The scenery is amazing and the waves are realistic. There are no people, no traffic, no commercials, no cells phones, no music, no voices- just nature. It's you and the beach. The locations chosen are truly awe-inspiring. Very soothing & relaxing dvd. 60 minutes, then it loops (replays). Highly recommended."
2,ONE OFF,A ONE SHOT SELF CONTAINED STORY ABOUT MID RUN ALONG IN VOLUME 1(1991)OF THE VIGILANTE PUNISHER SERIES IS AN OK STORY ABOUT THE PUN MAN AND DOUBLE CROSSING AND MURDER GOING ON IN CHINA TOWN A DIFFERENT SETTING FOR THE KILLER VIGILANTE IS THE ONLY THING THAT SETS IT OUT FROM ANY OTHER ISSUE.... FOR PUNISHER COMPLETISTS ONLY AM AFRAID !!!!
4,helpful book,this book was very interesting and helpful when it came to reading the future in your palm.
5,Excellent Addition to the Scales,"This book gives detailed information to supplement the ECERS. For visual people, the photographs in the book are extremely helpful!"
5,Can I rated this higher than five!,"Finally...the full ""Dreamgirls"" score with dialogue. What a cast! Audra McDonald, Heather Hedley, Lillias White, Billy Porter, Darius de Haas, Norm Lewis, Adrian Bailey...with Alice Ripley, Emily Skinner, Malcolm Gets, Brad Oscar, and Brian Stokes Mitchell thrown in for good measure. Wish I had been there! Maybe we can pray for a DVD of the concert."
2,For the diehard dreamgirl only!,"This is not an easy listen at all. It's just too much noise and fanfare. Contrary to many opinions, I think the Original Cast Recording contained just the right highlights, plus you had the one and only Jennifer Holliday - the only one entitled to belt out those two infamous songs to perfection. This full recording is just too busy and crowded all the time, and everywhere which makes the storyline meticuloously laborious to follow. I, personally, wouldn't recommend it."
1,Dreamgirls 2001,This was the worst reproduction of Dreamgirls that I ever heard. I was so disappointed the CD went into the garbage. This is one CD that I would not sell to the public because I expect so much and get so little.
3,Nothing beats the first time,"Not as good as the original cast album,but yet better because it's the whole score dialouge and all. Audra McDonald does great as Deena,Heather is excellent as Lorell, but Lillias White [was not good] as Effie. Her voice was more popish than Jennifer Holiday. Lillias wasn't soulfull enough.The way she butcherdAnd I am telling you I'm not going made me want to butcher her. She [was not good] on all of the songs she lead except for I am changing. Now I know no one is going to take the place of Jennifer Holiday,but god they could've did so much better. They could've gotten Kelly Price or Jill Scott. But all the guys were excelent. Norm Lewis sounded just like Ben Harney. But overall I really liked this cd and advise you to buy this cd"
4,really nice rendition by extremely talented people,"i aactually saw this in concert and it was wonderful. now that i have the CD, I have grown more attached to the music, and am still amazed by the talented performers. yes, this was recorded live, so some of the vocals might be a little shaky at times. however, the energy is there, and its really a dream cast. norm lewis is fabulous as also, and headley, white, and mcdonald are really perfect for their parts and really do sound great in them. so yes, they might not be able to deliver the best vocal performances while doing such an intense, live, demanding show but nothing so terrible. okay, anyway i think its a really great CD and a great show (the storyline and the music) I would seriously consider buying this CD."
5,If you never knew this show...,"As a young theatre buff, I never got a chance to see Dreamgirls when it was running. This CD not only sounds great, but it includes dialogue to help bring the story to life. I think Lillias White does a great job at the Jennifer Holiday role. Audra McDonald is also fantastic. For any Side Show fans, this is a must-have!! Henry Krieger also wrote this show and the music holds a certain likeness. Enjoy!"
2,Not my favorite version,"Having seen the original Broadway production and being very familiar with that soundtrack, I was disappointed by this. While I'm glad to have a complete recording, I just felt like it lacked the spark of both the Broadway and movie recordings, especially Audra McDonald's performance (which surprised me). I'm not talking about the difference in quality because it's a live recording - I'm talking about the performances themselves. The feeling behind the words and music wasn't really there."
3,A DREAM MISSED,"i WAS SO EXICTED TO RECEIVE THIS IN THE MAIL, AND ALTHOUGH THE MUSIC IS ON POINT SOME OF THE MUSCIAL NUMBERS FALL SHORT. HEATHER HEADELY DOES NOT COME CLOSE TO THE FIREY lORRETA DIVINE,MCDONALD, ALTHOUGH A GREAT ACTRESS MISSES SOME OF THE SOFT SOUNDS THAT WERE INTENDED FOR DEENA JONES, I STLL HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS WAS A GREAT IDEA TO DO, I HAVR BEEN LONGING FOR THIS SINCE THE ORIGINAL PRODUCTION OF DREAMGIRLS BACK IN THE EIGHTIES. THIS IS STILL A MUSICAL THAT WILL NEVER DIE."
1,Im looking for something,"This cast is bland. The acting is Horrible. The songs/music are boring not like the OBC where you get chills. The actors act like they are bored also. Like they do this show everyday on Broadway.I thought this would have more of a motown sound,Sounds like pop.Seth R said he didn't want to make a reunion cast but I think it would have been better.If all of the leads are alive and well then Why Not?Also why does Lillias White do a ""WHOA"" in the middle of ""And Im Telling You"" she didn't sing that song like I thought she could.Everyone on here is giving this 5 stars but I dont know what they're listening to."
1,A Ridiculous Book -- Don't Buy It,"The book is not reasoned well and poorly written by a fairly arrogant author who seems only interested in building up his own reputation. The book is not practical, and its theories stir up more questions than they answer."
5,A Winner,"This book is a winner! I am not a lawyer, but I read Beyond Winning, underlined it, and used it as a guide during a difficult set of negotiations. It gave me useful ideas and language. More importantly, it helped me be both assertive and flexible. By taking me through situations that others faced and showing me the steps that they used to resolve their conflicts, I learned about myself and the person I was confronting. In my case, although neither of us came out with all we sought, both of us came out ahead. And we had the satisfaction of resolving our differences peacefully, quickly, and out of court. I recommend Beyond Winning enthusiastically!"
1,Not recognized as a Blu-Ray disc on 2 attempts,I purchased this so called Blu-Ray disc twice but both discswere immediately rejected by my Panasonic BD-55Blu-Ray player. There was something very wrong with a company releasingtitles that were authored incorrectly like this. I had to returnthe defective products at my own expense to get a refund back.
3,Tchaikovsky in Blue-ray,"So far, not what I had hoped for. I might need to give it a couple more listens for it to grow on me."
1,Doesn't work,"I tried in three different Blu ray players: this disk doesn't work. and I open the box, I mean I bougt it NEW.Why? Why companies throw they products without previous testing? Why I have to pay for one man's hungry to achieve ""top performance"" in his dirty job? I'm just a buyer who wants to enjoy the music. And pay for this and I don't get a single sound, it's simple; it's just anfair...Enjoy the prize to achieve your goals, sales manager, don't you forget the bill's coming sooner or later."
4,Every church official should own this,"This book should be mandatory reading before a person can get a degree in the religion field or hold any position in the church. It is extremely insightful and presents the dilemma of age dynamics within the religious field. However, the author's attitude came across as condescending and I even felt that he should have watched how he referred to the older folks on more than one occasion. He loses a star for lack of attention to wording."
1,Modelo Antiguo-A Novel of Mexico City ?,"I was very disappointed in this book for many reasons not the least of which is that this novel is about a couple IN Mexico City, but the book is not ABOUT Mexico City. I bought this book mainly because of the title an the blurb by Benjamin Alire Saenz on the cover stating that this book ""brings English readers a real taste of Mexico City streets."" I have been collecting fiction and nonfiction about Mexico City for over twenty-five years, and this book is not a keeper !"
2,My first review,"I'm a long term Amazon purchaser, but this is my first review -I've wanted to give back to the community for a while now. I had to return this product and that's a rare thing for me.I learned that for the same price you can get a modem that is much easier to set up and is half the size of this unit. I tried out my friends modem (an ActionTec from Bestbuy) and I was able to get faster speeds. I had recently cancelled AT&T; and ordered DSL 2+ from Sonic because they were cheaper and supposedly much faster.The next week the technician from Sonic sold me a ZXDSL 831. This unit was also not only much smaller and easier to set up but gave me much faster speeds then I got from the Netopia."
2,Will not be using...,"This is a great beginning science book about frogs that I would have liked to use in our homeschool. However, the first couple of pages are about the evolution of the frog. It states that the frog has been around for millions of years, before monkeys or cats or people. The next page has pictures showing how the frog evolved from fish. These pages are totally unnecessary to the rest of the text, so it's unfortunate that the author included them. Use caution if you're from a creationist viewpoint."
2,Could have been great,"Wonderful illustrations and lots of fun facts, but alas, another science book carrying the water bucket for evolution. The brief research I did after reading this book shows that no fossil has been found that shows any transition from fish to amphibian. The skeletal structure of a fish could not support an amphibian, nor are the internal organs the same. These are major changes that would have taken time and thus history would show a transition. The book begins with the evolution of the frog from fish. While it is an interesting theory, it is simply that, until proven otherwise, yet rarely is it ever stated to children that these are theories. I do believe in evolution, the evolution of science, as new things are being discovered every day, and what we believe changes accordingly."
1,No stars would be a better rating...,"If you have absolutely no knowledge of the Currency Markets then this book may be useful to you. The subtitle of the book is ""Manage Risk and Reward in the Forex Markets by Learning How to:...""Unfortunately, the overwhelming majority of the book is about Currency Futures and Options but NOT Forex."
4,Better than the original watchers,"This movie was made the way Dean Koontz meant it to be when he wrote the book. It follows the book, and contains the romantic side, which the original Watchers did not. I believe this to be one of Koontz's best."
5,This Movie Rocks!!! (And I Would Like A Date With Ms. Scoggins!!!),This is a vey good Science Fiction movie about a Super Intelligent dog and a Genetically Engineered Killing Machine. Ms. Scoggins gives a very fine performance in this film and she has a lot of on screen chemistry with Marc Singer. Plus she also looks very sexy in glasses. I am sorry that she did not become a Major Movie Star because she most certainly had the talent for it.
5,"Looking for Risk, then buy this!","After spending many weeks trying to find an ""old"" copy of Risk II to buy, I found this. It has Risk I, Risk II, and Civilization II all in one box. This whole package was cheaper than buying one of the old copies of Risk II alone!You get the best of all worlds...Risk one includes a great classic version of the game, plus the added games of Castle Risk (I think thats what they call it) where you can play with states in Europe and have attacking strategies. Risk two has great graphics, and the addition of simultaneous risk is a GREAT addition...really gives the game new life that isn't possible off the computer. I haven't ever played Civ II, but I am sure it is in there for a reason...BUY THIS if you like Risk...you get them all for next to NOTHING!"
4,"Great game, but no Internet option","Great game if you love Risk. However, I was very dissapointed to find out that there is no real Internet ability. They used to have the ability to play on zone.com, but that support is no longer provided. Unless you are on a LAN, or are adept at setting up a VPN, there is no way to play with a friend over the Internet. VERY DISSAPOINTING!!!However, for the game itself, it works fine on my Win 2000 machine. No bugs that I have found which is pretty good for an older game title."
3,Good resource,Very easy to read book and has helped a lot in my understanding of Child Psychology. Good read and great sell back rate!
4,Great live set from the band's transitional period...,"Recorded in 1986, the last year TALK TALK would ever perform live concerts, this collection shows the band in a transitional state, playing mostly pop material from ITS MY LIFE and COLOUR OF SPRING with longer, more introspective arrangements. The trio of Webb, Hollis and Harris are augmented by two percussionists, two keyboardists, a guitarist and Mark Feltham on harmonica. For those of you who own the bootleg TALKING COLOURS, this is a completely different set (though some of the songs are the same) so don't worry about any repetition. IF YOU OWN THE BOOTLEG, BUY THIS CD! You won't be disappointed! Hollis is as pensive and introspective as always, and the extended songs incorporate subtle solos and some intense jamming. This is a beautiful and mesmerizing set, driven by Harris' steady rythms, Webb's tasteful bass lines and the tribal effect of the added percussionists (ORang fans take note)."
4,Early favorites,"When a group has been around so long it is hard to put their best on one disc;such is the case with this disc. Granted it does have some of their best songs but a sampling of fourteen songs doesn't do justice to this group. I enjoy ths disc still on occasion and found it to be a good way to get a sampling of Spyra Gyra on my I-Pod; a perfect interlude and surprise when it is on shuffle. Some of my favorite early Spyro Gyra songs are featured here including their signature tune ""Morning Dance."" If you are looking for a collection of ""hits"" from their early period than this is the disc for you. This is Jay Beckenstein at his earliest best. Recommended for fans of smooth jazz. Now where is that deserving box set?"
3,"Works, but not that great","I use both an oil-based remover and this one... And I must say the oil-based one does a better and faster job.I need to rub quite a bit using this one and it stings if it gets into my eyes. It also takes a lot longer and is less effective since it just turns mascara into a slushy gooey sticky substance. :(It also leaves behind a sticky feeling, I'm never sure if it's actually clean or not so I go over it with a cleanser.When I'm done with my shower I have raccoon eyes, so I clean it one more time with a eyelid cleanser."
4,europe on $ 5.00 a day,"in the mid. 60s,we went to europe on five dollars a day.you can only do that when you are young.this book was interesting,even though it is somewhat dated."
3,Speidel brand?,"I received this watchband promptly from the seller, but was disappointed to discover it was not a Speidel brand. I contacted the seller about receiving an imitation and two genuine Speidel brand replacements were provided - quickly and at no cost."
4,Foundations of Vacuum Science and Technology,This is a very useful book for the people who is interested in Vacuum technoloyies.
5,Good Introduction to Vacuum System,I have used this book as an undergraduate and graduate student. This is a great book that takes you from the basics to the more advanced technologies. A must have for a lab.
3,Only one major flaw,"I got one of these monitors with a Compaq PC purchase. It does what it's supposed to do... mostly. It works as a monitor and works well. My only drawback to the monitor was the right channel speaker never worked. Not in any of 2 PC's I've had that I've hooked up this monitor to. I still use it as a monitor, but bought some separate speakers which both channels worked on, so, it's definitely a fault in the monitor. You may not experience this problem with such a monitor, but, I've laid out my story with one for anyone who wants to take a caveat about buying it."
1,Not sure,I wanted more from this book and it just wasn't there. The Practical Model works but it is convulted and this text was very editorial to me.Just not sure about what is offered and there seems to be better ways to skin a cat as it relates to Practical Theology.Thanks.
2,This is no allstar workout,I am a big fan of MaDonna Grimes from Allstar Workouts but this video was very disappointing. It seemed as if this video was made for the dancers in the video to showcase thier hip hop skills. This could of been an okay cardio workout video if the routine was danced out a few more times.
2,Great Information But Poorly Written,"I really wanted to love this book since I am completely fascinated by the subject matter. It just did not happen. The author seems to be a fan of Old West folklore and that passion comes across to the reader but that enthusiasm does not make up for poor writing and organization of the text. At times, the book was highly repetitive and too one-sided. This is a history book yet the author uses such statements along the lines of ""It is obvious to people that..."" or ""As any student of history should know..."" A personal pet peeve was the misspelling of actress Lillie Langtry's first name as ""Lily.""I wouldn't cast the book completely aside and actually did recommend it to a few of my friends. I learned a lot and found it to be an interesting read - but that was only after I got past the writing."
2,Compilation of Other's Authors Research,"It is sad to say, but I read this book and found pieces of it lifted almost word for word from other author's works. There is no primary research, just secondary re-hashing. If someone is looking for a summary work, this may suit their purpose and the chapters are entertaining to read. However, I would advise against investing time and/or money with this book on western prostitution with so many better examples to chose from, and by authors who at least took the effort to use their own words."
3,Upstairs Girls,"An interesting history of prostitution in the old west. I only wish there were more pictures of the old west. I enjoy this period. The desperation of these women in a time when the only work available was wife,servant,laundress,or prostitute. The double standard of wife being good, prostitute bad, even though a majority of these women got into to this profession due to the death of a husband or being lured to the west with promises of marriage when there were none. Despite the fact some of these fallen women donated money to causes and helped sick people they were still shunned by ""polite society"". Such a sad story . All in all this was a good book."
3,"Interesting topic, boring writing","I was really excited to stumble upon this book. I thought it would be written in the spirit of most of the ""mythic"" old west. The topic held a lot of promise, but unfortunately the book is written as a parade of facts and observations, many of which were so obvious I'm not even sure why they made the cut. I felt like I was reading a high school term paper where the student was trying to cram in as much as they could to ensure the teacher knew they had done research. There was no real flow to the writing, even within chapters it could be quite jarring. Were this professor to do another book, I suggest working with a ghost writer!"
5,Upstairs Girls - Prostitution in the American West,This book is extremely interesting concerning prostitution in the days of the old west. I learned a lot and enjoyed reading the information. Highly recommend this book to those who are interested in reality. I've thought of purchasing a few more copies to give as gifts to my friends.
3,French book,"I love this textbook, but the condition in which it was sent to me was terrible. There are swear words and profanity written throughout the book and it is really sad that I can't show it to my student because the language is so bad. It was labeled as Very Good and hardly used, but this was not good at all."
3,french,I think that this is a very good book for kids grades 6-8 but also for people just learning french.
1,Maybe it helps if you use a PC.,"MAC USERS: One thing that should be pointed out before you buy this book. This book will do you no good whatsoever. Long about page 5 there is a disclaimer that the server applications used as examples in the manual are nor available for the Macintosh. So sorry. Thanks for the money. See ya! At least with most software, you are warned if it'll work for your platform. The Friends of Ed are no friends of mine."
3,A Bit Thin,"Friend's of Ed probably could have put a little more time and effort into this one. The book, less than 400 pages of Ultra Dev instruction does not cover development of applications for the more advanced database connectivity methods, ie: OLE DB connections.The book could have gone through another round of editing, as there were more than a few obvious typos, making some of the instruction difficult to follow.However, I'm still a ""friend of ed"" and will continue to rely on their wonderful series of books to get the education I need."
4,Pretty Cool,"Very hands on...the only way to learn this stuff. I'd agree with others who say this is one of the best books they have on their shelf. That said, I'd say this book is good for those who already have a basic understanding of databases, ASP and Dreamweaver. Nothing in this book is very in depth but rather an overview of what UD can do and more importantly HOW to do it and WHY. I'd give it 5 stars if there weren't so many really STUPID errors (like missing ='s). There's tons of silliness like that which is another reason why I say the reader really should have some previous knowledge."
5,The best UD4 user guide,"This is the best UD4 book out to date. Not that there are a plethora of books yet, but it far surpasses the MM user guide. The examples are very clear and well demonstrated. The book assumes you know nothing about UD4 or asp, but clearly explains the details necessary to get a useable site up and running. It was well worth the price."
3,The end of a great love affair,"I have a been a big fan of the Friends ofEd series since the beginning. The foundation series are great for everybody intertested in learning Flash and Dreamweaver (although the amount of typos amazed me in Foundation Actionscript).I'm somewhat saddened to say that their latest release on Dreamweaver Ultradev has left me somewhat disappointed. I find this book to be somewhat bias. All the book covers is the use of ASP and does make small mentions of other languages used (JSP,Cold Fusion).Not all webmasters utilize ASP on their sites, some of us use Java Server Pages, cold Fusion and others.It's always a sad day when the end of a beautiful love affair closes in. Sorry Friends of Ed but a bias opinion doesn't count."
2,Foundation Dreamweaver UltraDev 4,"I usually like the tutorial style of the Foundation Series. In this case, however, the authors didn't reveiw their tutorials as thoroughly as it is required so as to not confuse a novice. There are errors in the code, some of the completed files that can be downloaded don't work (Chapter 7 files are a good example) and sometimes, filenames are mixed up or not even mentioned so that one has to add a significant dose of imagination to figure out what the authors wanted to say but never quite got done saying. What a waste of my time!"
3,Good idea - full of errors,"The concept of this book is very good - explaining all the necessary functions of a retail web page by example. The authors are also intent on the reader learning the code to write and alter the web page functions. This would be great except for the fact that every single chapter I've worked in so far is full of errors. Some are small errors - like inconsistent cases in the naming of forms. Others, however, are huge errors like leaving out entire lines of code or code that just plain doesn't work. Unless you have the patience of a saint and a high speed internet connection, which you'll want to access their help page and example files (apparently a cd would have been too big of a commitment) as you struggle with the errors in every single chapter, then don't bother with this book."
1,"Dishonest, misleading system requirements","Who runs Windows 98 or ME anymore? Nobody. This software will not run on ANY NT-based OS, including 2000 and XP. I've tried.(..)For Atari to continue selling this (I don't care who they bought it from) is criminal.Do not buy this title unless you're running a 9x-based machine. Better yet, don't buy it at all or anything from Atari until they sell software that will run on operating systems that are not five years out of date.(..)"
3,For small children,"My son is almost 3 and this game is much to easy for him. Of course it being Thomas he still likes it, but the other games are much better. If your child is familer with the computer at all and over 2 1/2 dont' buy this, but for a first game it would be great!"
4,"Works on XP, Vista","Kids 2-5 love it. But you already know that from the other reviews. I wanted to comment on compatibility.I believe we have this edition - it's fairly old, and it has the Hasbro brand.It appears to work fine on both XP (SP3) and Vista Home Basic. I installed it on XP a long time ago and don't remember if I had to do anything special, but I don't immediately see anything. I just now installed it on Vista, and it appears to work fine immediately.Printing does switch away from the window, and you have to switch back manually. (That's why it only gets four stars.)BTW, this game is great for teaching mouse-eye coordination."
5,AT HIS BEST,"DION IS 69 YEARS OLD AND SOUNDS LIKE HE IS 25.HIS TRACK LISTING RUNS HIS ENTIRE CAREER TO THE PRESENT.HIS VOICE IS REMARKABLY CRISP AND SHOWS WHY HE IS A GREAT GUTIAR PLAYER.I RECCOMEND THIS TO ANY DION FAN.HE MAKES ALL OF THESE LEGENDARY SONGS SOUND LIKE THEY WERE RECORDED IN THE 2000S.------------------------DION,NEWMASTERS"
4,Big fun with mini birds for little bird-watchers,"Another Dover Little Book. This one has eighteen small tattoos of popular birds. They're very colorful and very realistic, and bring smiles to kids and adults alike. My own favorite is the rosy faced lovebird, followed closely by the sandpiper and the goldfinch. Other birds depicted are the brown pelican, the blue jay, a hummingbird, a robin, a sparrow, a bluebird, an owl, a gold and blue macaw, a Baltimore oriole, a woodpecker, the bald eagle, a penguin, a toucan, a scarlet tanager, and a flamingo."
3,purchase not needed,"This seems to be a perfectly good tube, however, one was included with the tire I purchased. Did I miss something?It wasn't clear that a tube came with the tire."
4,"Good for Wheel Barrow, Too","This inner tube worked fine for my ""tubeless"" 380 wheel barrow tire also. It had been impossible to keep air in the not-so-often used wheel barrow tire."
1,Flat,Tire wouldn't hold air and is a piece of junk.....Don't waste your time and I don't recommend you purchase it.
4,interesting,"Funny story about a guy that tries to find a bottle of dom perignon for a woman. Also, he and animal are on the search for the greatest party ever."
1,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"I expected this player to be extremely cool, but it isn't. Not only could I not get the full advanced resolution DVD-Audio to work, but this thing wouldn't even play most of my CD's, including the brand new Ozzy Osbourne remasters. I was very disappointed. The picture quality was also [poor]compared to my old player, and I was using a gold plated S-Video cable. My old player is a Panasonic, and I am very happy with it, which is why I bought this one, I just don't know what happened. Now it is possible that I received a defective product, but I would think twice when buying this item, and if you do, be sure to save your receipt."
1,Reiki?,"I am a beginning Reiki student and eager to read all material that will advance my studies. I was very disappointed in this selection. I feel that it is one woman's catharsis on a dysfunctional family and served very little information to a first time Reiki student looking for guidance. While I totally respect the author, the angst she is feeling, and her role with the International organization, I do not see the value of this ""diary entry"". Other titles on Reiki better serve the interests of beginning students, in my opinion."
3,This is NOT a book about Reiki,"This book is a biography of a Reiki Master. It does not include the ""How to"" or even the ""What"" of Reiki. This book discusses the events in a Reiki Master's life and encourages you to find similar events in your life and apply Reiki to the negative emotions."
2,For those who wish to drown in self-absorbed emotion,way too gushy and self-absorbed to be useful for me. I've been doing (in this life) this work for over a quarter of a century and have books on Reiki that are MUCH MORE USEFUL
2,No support and problems with DVD burning,"Buyer beware.If you go to www.optorite.com you get a shell website with no content. There is support.I have the drive for 2 years now, and had problems with many DVD media types. I was able to burn fine with Ritec DVD+R 4X media, but Sony TDK and Samsung gave me hard time.I also had problems reading DVD's that were burnt on same system.CD burning is OK, no issues.The worst thing is that there's no support and there's no recommanded list of DVD media to use with it."
2,"Not very compatible, no longer reads CD-R's","I've had this drive for about seven months now. As of yet, I've only been able to create on DVD that worked in a player. This could be due to the media I've used, though I doubt it.Also, about three months ago the drive sped up and would not slow down until I powered off the computer. Since then, it no longer is able to read CD-R's. I have no idea how this happened, and since I have a CD-RW drive it's not that big of a deal to me. But it might be to others.Given the price of good drives these days, I'd stick with a better brand, such as Panasonic, Pioneer or the NEC ND-2510A."
5,For professionals and for parents!,"This book contains a myriad of excellent ideas for both the professional as well as the parent in improving everyday dysfunctions with the family, provides tips on how to manage life's basic and more complicated challenges, including communication, scheduling, positive reinforcement of parenting skills, self-care, and various mental disorders. It is also an excellent tool and resource for using in an adult or late adolescent group setting. For those professionals who do family therapy, it keeps the therapist and the client on track-one of the biggest challenges when there are five people in the room!"
5,where did he go?,"since jazz is not my forte if i heard this anywhere without knowing what it was i would have thought it to be one of the jazz giants of the 50's and 60's. somehow this cd crosses the gap of classic jazz to smooth jazz but it is not smooth jazz as defined today.doing songs by charlie parker,sonny stitt,sonny rollins,acker bilk will give you a feel of the prowess of this young sax musician. playing with him are recognizable names as clark terry,nicholas payton, benny green and kenny washington.so the question remains WHY HASN'T HE RECORDED AGAIN AS A SOLO ACT? this cd was released in 1991 and this is the only cd that comes up when you put amani a. w.-murray in the search box here at amazon. anyway for $.o1 + shipping you can get this treasure. don't miss out!""rpm"""
4,Is he 14 or 40?,"It is difficult to believe, because of the maturity and well-craftedness of this album, that Amani A.W. Murray was only a young teenager when he made it. Recording for major jazz record label GRP, which is home to such jazz stalwarts as David Benoit, The Rippingtons, and Nelson Rangell, the kid sounds right at home with such distinguished company, especially on the eight minute sax-blues masterpiece ""Blues For The Blues""."
5,Great,This is great if you are someone who likes to travel light. I didn't really like the bulk of a wallet...even a small one. This replaces the wallet perfectly. I carry what I need with this; couldn't ask for more. It holds my cards & money securely.
1,money clip,I ordered a clip and did not ever receive it. I did get my money back through Amazon and do appreciate that.
1,Storus Smart Money Clip is a piece of junk!,"Although I did not like the look of this money clip on the internet, I ordered it as a Christmas present for my boyfriend who said it was ""exactly"" what he wanted. I could not be more diappointed in this item, which I am now stuck with since I was stupid enough to have it ""laser"" engraved by the company. I am so horrified and embarrassed by this worthless piece of garbage that I am trashing it rather than embarrassing myself by actually giving it to him. You have to struggle to get folded bills in it, and sliding cards in it is truly an exercise in futility. Totally disappointed in my complete waste of money. Should have gone with my instincts. If it looks like crap, it probably is."
2,Good idea gone bad,"I rated this product 2 stars for the idea and fast shipment. However, this is solid metal money clip, and has no elasticity. When you try put your CCs, you actually need to make your cards bend to be able to fit 4 cards at the same time. BTW, there is no way that you can put 5 cards without damaging your cards. Product has bad quality of finishing. Plastic cards can actually make paint to chip! This would be a great product if the material were carbon or a similar kind of plastic mixture.Honestly, I have no idea how come people ""loved"" this item."
5,Great Product,"Very fast delivery (Something I appreciate) arrived within 48 hours, solid product (so far :P) and I am liking it..what more? I threw my wallet away because of this....need to simplify my life so figured I'll use a money clip. The only negative I'd say I have about this is that, when you have about 4-5 cards (credit cards etc) they tend to BEND a little..which can damage the cards in the long run...but no big deal."
2,Typos a speciality,If books were priced by the error this book would be gold. You cannot follow the directions given in this text because of the errors. The Redhat documents on-line were much more helpful.
4,"Great sound, but require some getting used to","These work very well and sound great. They also do a very good job screening out the ambient noise: I've used them while working out and not been bothered by all of the noise in the gym and even been able to listen to the music I chose instead of the stuff the gym was piping in. I've even been able to listen to music while mowing the lawn and not have the music drowned out by the mower engine. Wonderful!I've had some small difficulty getting used to them. They're described as ""in-ear"" headphones, which is quite accurate: instead of traditional headphones which sit outside of your ear, these are actually inserted into your ears. That felt strange to me at first -- it still feels a little strange. If you're uncomfortable sticking something down into your ear canal, you might be happier with more traditional headphones. But I think the sound and quality of these headphones are worth working through the initial discomfort."
1,Unwilling to stand behind the product,"I purchased this product from Amazon as a Christmas gift. It was delivered broken and unusable, yet Amazon and BlueProton have both refused the return. BUYERS...BE AWARE!"
2,Creative Aurvana In-Ear Headphones.,Ear plugs work well. Volume doesn't get as loud as I would like but they do block most of the outside noise. They don't stay in the ear as securely as I feel they should.
2,Disappointed,"The service from Amazon was amazingly fast. ThanksThe product: Honestly, my $15 creative headphones have better sound! By far. Low frequencies are awful! For a $110 set, I feel generous with 2 stars."
2,Chord is microphonic,"These are very comfortable, small and light, and they block the ambient noise very well. There are a couple of major problems however. One is that the chord is microphonic. It transmits a loud scraping sound to the earpieces when it rubs on your face or clothing. The other is the response. The only other earphones I have to compare it against are the Ultimate Ears Super.fi 3, (a.k.a. Altec Lansing UHP336). The Zen suffers very badly by comparison. It has an uneven frequency response with a bump in the mid treble range around 3kHz to 5kHz that makes it sound shouty. Another nit is that there is no room in the supplied carrying case for the airplane connection adapter."
2,Save your money; buy the EP-630's,"I bought these as a replacement for my Creative EP-630's after the left earbud stopped producing sound. I decided to spring for a more expensive pair of Creative earphones, since I liked the EP-630's sound and wanted to hear what a expensive Creative earphones would sound like. So far, I've been disappointed by their sound and overall quality- they sound no better than the EP-630's, but cost twice as much. Also, the cord is made out of the material Creative uses for its basic headphones, which is not as reliable as the other cord material.On the bright side, the headphones do offer better insulation than the EP-630's, and they don't sound bad, but certainly should sound better considering their price."
1,Cheap product and even worse customer service,"I purchased these at a airport, so returning them to the store is next to impossible, they worked for about 10 minutes, after contacting the store they pawned me off on the company and after contacting Creative they tried to pawn me off on the store, after finally contacting Creative by email the only way to contact them, they expect me to pay to return them to their service department and pay a fee to look at them. I should have stuck with Shure great customer service and they actually work."
3,Quality decays over time,"I've had these since December 9th, and my first impression was that it's near perfect. However, as time went on, the flaws became more apparent.First of all, the ear buds are very small. That may sound like a good thing, but putting it on requires delicacy. I've often bend the wires because the ear buds are too small for my hands (and my hands are small already).Secondly, the wires misshape itself. This sounds weird, but the wires do become crookedly and there's nothing you can do to reshape it.Sound quality wise, it fairs little better than the V-Moda."
5,"So good, I bought a pair for my wife",I purchased my first in-ear-headphones for myself in March. Sound quality is good. External noise reduction is also good. I surprised my wife and bought a set for her when she lost her other headset.
3,Not Good for Running,"The Creative Zen Aurvana In-Ear Headphones is a good product, but it doesn't work when I run. If I'm using the stairmaster they work just fine, and even walking on the treadmill is fine. The problem is running either on the treadmill or outdoors - I can hear the pounding of my feet that reverberates through the body in my ears. I don't have that issue with earphones that fit over the ear. The product comes with different size ear molds - that's great because I had to play with the different sizes until I found a combination that works for me. Overall, I'm not sure this product was worth the price."
2,poor sound for money,"Well made, nice carrying case and packaging, sound quality is very poor for the price. I have $15 in-ear phonesthat blow them away.Good for joggers and active folks who don't know know or care about fidelity but for almost $100 these sound like crap IMHO.I expected better, most Creative earbuds sound pretty good but these are Dogs, no detail in hi,mid and the bass is a joke, for this price I expected reasonable flat, low distortion phones, these simply do NOT cut it.The $20 creative MZ0365 EP-830 blow these POS out of the water, so save your money, also the JBL 220put the Aurvana to shame for about $30. (Beware though, there are a lot fake JBL 220's on ebay etcThey look like a cheap knock-off of the Shure EC3 but they must be made in some Chinese sweat shop or laborcamp, shame on you Creative. !!!Pro Sound engineer so I know what I'm talking about."
4,Saw this in the Theater,"Yup...saw it that long ago and it was great. Great concept, great acting...a little dated but, cool movie!"
4,Above average,"Overall well-done science-fiction for it's time, though seemed pieced together at the end. Good quality DVD & picture."
2,DVD Quality Mediocre,"The brainstorm movie is a good one, but I was VERY disappointed by the quality of the prints and compression used for this DVD. The picture makes you want more vibrant colors and sharpness. More like a VHS quality picture. Many compression artifacts. One of the worst picture quality I have seen. They need to re-release this thing and remaster it. This one is just not up to the promise of DVD's. I have seen other DVD's, like the Philadelphia Experiment that have incredibly good quality transfers."
3,Widescreen Film on a 4:3 Disc,"At theaters when the sequences with the Brainstorm-apparatus unfold throughout the movie, the ordinary widescreen image streched to full Cinemascope widescreen (originated in 65mm) and stereo sound. The Laserdisc recaptured this experience. This DVD has the ordinary picture in widescreen and LETTERBOXING the special scenes so these are even SMALLER instead of wider. Also there is a 4:3 version where all scenes are 4:3. This film would deserve a special edition supervised by Mr. Trumbull."
2,"Great Film, Lousy DVD","This is a truly great film, and like Bladerunner, was years ahead of its time. Unfortunately this DVD has is possibly one of the worst transfers I've seen. If your thinking of buying, don't. Wait until the studio releases gets it together and gives this film the attention it deserves with a restored anamorphic release."
5,Absolutely fantastic - a dream come true,"I first saw this movie on German TV in the 80s. I loved it for its thrilling story, the great actors, especially Walken, whom I adore. And of course for the (at the time) advanced graphic sfx. I owned it on VHS once. But for a long time I've been hoping for a real good HD disc(which by the way still isn't available in Germany).Now this region free Blu Ray has made my dream come true. An amazingly great quality in sharpness and colour brilliance, let alone the fantastic audio track. Unbelievable for a movie of that age.Luckily I'm good in English language, as there is no German audio. This encluded it would really be making my day."
4,brain-pick,"I have always been a big Natalie Wood fan and this was her lastpicture. She did a good job as did Christopher Walken andLouise Fletcher. As a sci-fi flick it is better than average.The special effects were okay, but just a little dated.The concept of recording your every thought and feeling isdefinitely a cut above virtual reality, although a littlescary. All in all a good movie."
2,Remastered ruined a good movie,"I remember seeing Brainstorm in the theaters and loved it. The VHS was OK, and the first DVD was an OK transfer as well. Then again, the TV I was watching it on was a knob-tuner 19"". Again I enjoyed the movie though the heart attack/death scene gave my ex some bad nightmares. Now I have a 50"" plasma and wanted a better DVD. This one looked promising but failed. Hopefully they'll bring out a blu-ray and just leave the original movie alone. As some have mentioned, not the greatest of acting but a good story and great effects (remember it was done in 1983).What I can't understand is why they stripped out scenes for this ""remastered"" version. The sound is improved but they had no need of removing anything. Not as bad as what happened with the 'Director's Cut of 'Bladerunner', but nearly so. I'm almost sorry I trashed my VHS."
1,DVD quality is horrible,"Brainstorm is a great movie, but I wouldn't know that from the viewing I just had. The quality of this DVD is absolutely terrible. We spent the entire movie adjusting for extremes in brightness and contrast and still could not view some segments of the movie at all--the screen was completely black in some parts. You'd be better off buying or renting a VHS copy."
3,"Love the movie, bad transfer here on the DVD","I've loved this movie since it came out (yes, I'm an ancient person who saw it in the theater).However, I just got this DVD and it appears they screwed up the transfer. The film is _supposed_ to be a 2.35 format movie but was transferred for a 1.85 academy projection. So all of the scenes that were shot with 65mm show up cropped, all of those shot on 35mm are full frame. Very annoying and a waste of space that could have been used for a higher bitrate compression.Granted, this is one of those early DVD transfers that has ""widescreen"" on one side and ""standard"" on the other. Even for $10, I'd pass on this and wait for this movie to be retransferred correctly on Blu-Ray or some future format."
3,Someday this Will Be Possible,"I gave this movie 3 stars, actually 5 for the idea and premise and 1 for execution. The main problem of this really thought provoking story came at the end when some stupid marketing director (I presume) or producer decided to court in the kiddies by making the computers go crazy at the end with massive destruction of the scientific computer rooms which I guess was to be hilarious. The huge mistake was splicing all this in when the Christopher Walken character was plugged into the death video and seeing what the Louise Fletcher character saw at the moments (and after) of death. So therefore, your emotions are being tugged both directions at the same time. If I could, I would edit out the ludicrous computer chaos and just let the beautiful and ethereal death scene flow uninterrupted.Someday someone will invent this machine and we'll see things that are a huge mystery. Don't think I'll live that long but I envy the ones who do."
2,Very dated and not too exciting,"I bought this movie because it was Natalie Woods' last movie and it sounded interesting. However, the movie itself is kind of stale and the exciting parts are not too exciting."
4,One of Louise Fletcher's best performances.,"This is to be seen for Louise Fletcher. Her performance is superb, and what she does to advance the plot (not to mention what she does to get the special effects going)must be seen to be believed. A must for sci-fi fans, who not only get Fletcher and good FX, but they get Christopher Walken and a very early (this was made in 1983) Virtual reality storyline."
4,Brilliant acting & special effects ruined by weird aspect ratio configuration.,I can understand why the force behind the movie wanted to setup the aspect ratio so that the scenes portraying the virtual & simstim sequences appeared bigger. However the effect left me disappointed by what seemed like getting a dvd in 4:3 aspect ratio with occasional 16x9 performances.
3,Imagine This,The thing about Sci-Fi is some of the premises are actually possible and with the new high tech environment are no longer out of the question.... Natalie Wood is stunning!
3,Became slapstick at the end . . .,I remember seeing this movie in the theatre and I loved the first three quarters of the movie. Towards the end it became embarrassingly slapstick as if someone else directed it.
4,Brainstorm is NOT anamorphic,"I loved the concept of the movie, but on a flat HD screen it doesn't fill the screen. Could we have a special edition in anamorphic widescreen?"
4,Great movie. Aspect ratio changes a bit distracting.,"I have been waiting for a remastered copy of Brainstorm to come out on BluRay. I had forgotten that this film was shot in multiple aspect ratios, and when viewing it I was a bit distracted from the message of the film by the constant switching.Other than that, this is still the great film I remember. It's not the greatest (so only 4 stars), but certainly worth the cost and time investment. Highly recommended."
4,Realistic World War II issues for those on the homefront,"The difficulties of trying to go on living a life when you're worried about theloved ones in war a world away and the toll it takes while you're waiting for them to return. Being human. The extreme measures a woman must go to just to get by. Wonderful romantic scenes between Crowe and Hirt. The horror a soldierhas to endure before being deployed. Get a whole box of Kleenex, you'll need it. I am transported back in time every time I watch this film."
5,For The Moment,I loved this movie! Russell Crowe again gives a memorable performance. The picture as a whole was well done and after awhile you were actually living that period of WWII. Again I highly recommend it to all who have never seen it and for those who have it is worth a second look!
2,There was only one good thing in this movie,"And that's Russell Crowe, apparently the only real actor in this movie. All the other performances were stilted and wooden. I never felt anything for the heroine except annoyance. Too much time was taken up with a secondary romance. The story was predictable."
3,Not in the top ten,"I have to admit I also watched this movie for Russell Crowe.The characters are good and there are some interesting plot points but it is slow moving and I had to resist just turning off the T.V. a few times, but that was mostly due to the bad choice of music in a few scenes. It is a sweet movie and a treat to see Russell Crowe be so Australian...."
2,If It's Cheap Enough!,"""For The Moment"" is a trip to nowhere. The script creates a main plot which could be worthy of film but then creates so many sub-plots and diversions which are given equal billing, that the main plot is totally sacrificed. The acting (with the exception of Crowe) is right off the high school stage. Zeke's love affair with the local ""camp whore/bootlegger"" is meant to be touching/romantic but I found it to be fodder for emotional cripples. Several moments make the film worth watching if you can borrow it or buy it cheaply; firstly, the scenery from the low flying plane sequences is superb; secondly, Crowe manages to hold the story together; thirdly, Zeke's incredible, mind bending request of Lachlan(Crowe);fourthly, the ""Waltzing Matilda"" scene is extemely well done!"
3,Not a great film,"This movie is all over the place-too many silly subplots. Its supposed to be a love story. What does the town hooker have anything to do with anything? The girl Crowe is in love with is ugly, he's way too good for her. Its truly hard to believe he would go for someone like her, and for someone in her position (she's married can't he find a single one?). He's such a hunk he could have gotten someone better. Because of this, the movie failed for me. Still, if you're a Crowe fan, he looks pretty good! But not as good as in some (kinda chubby)."
3,"""For the Moment"" has its moments","It's easy to say the movie bogs down in mushy melodrama, but the way such opulent love is pitted against the tragedy of a war, the result is quite befitting. ""For the Moment"" plays out like the younger sister of ""The English Patient"", starting with a sublimely beautiful opening shot, and proceeding on to delicately break our hearts, even if the story seems too romantic to be plausible (which is not entirely true). There's a great performance from Crowe, and a notable one from Hirt. Great music and scenery. The movie can be described as nothing truly orginal, but hats off for the great effort and the way they expand on the theme. Even if it seems too goody-goody for it's own good, ""For the Moment"" does have its moments: Crowe's recital of ""High Flight"", the lovers singing ""Waltzing Matilda"", and several notably memorable lines of dialogue (""Best to just feel my way around."") It's worth a rental, but it's not terribly heavy stuff. Overall, not a bad movie."
4,Solid Nostalgic WWII Romance,"The story is quite good, depicting a real look at the way WWII affected people's emotions. Russell Crowe is excellent as the Aussie heartbreaker. The film may suffer slightly from the secondary romance, but it fits well within the overall plot of the movie. It made me want to be right in the middle of it. The filming is beautiful and the characters are engaging. I wish more movies like it were made."
3,This was a nice delight!,"OK...this is not a truly great film but it is a different role for the wonderful Mr. Crowe and a delight to see him in this type of role.This is more a rental-sit-at-home-and-watch type of film but a delight nonetheless. It is a sweet love story between an air pilot and a woman whose husband is at war and lonely, not knowing when he is returning. She slowly develops a friendship turning into a relationship with Crowe. It is a nice and entertaining film and Crowe is wonderful in it. The actress, Christianne Hirt, is sweet but not much chemistry between them. but it will be worth it to hear Crowe sing ""Waltzing Matilda"" while bathing and just to hear the classic line...""I have come to take you to the seaside Madame."" It is a sweet film that most would enjoy I believe."
4,Beautiful!,"There are better Russell Crowe movies, but this one is my sentimental favorite! It is beautiful and touches the heart with its simplicity!"
4,Not just For the Moment,"As a big fan of Russell Crowe I never cease to be amazed at this mans ability to get into his character. One can understand why he is the star he is. This isn't a movie for women only, my husband enjoyed it too. Fantastic scenery, great music and a good supporting cast helped make this movie very plausible. The children were a pleasant surprise, considering they didn't say very much, especially the little boy. This is a definite repeater and make sure you have a kleenex handy."
3,Earnest tribute to WWII pilots and their families,"Here's a chance to see Russell Crowe before he became a big star, in a Canadian film that actually takes place in Canada.The scene is a pilot training base near Winnipeg that trained pilots from Commonwealth countries and the U.S. during WWII. A lot of the drama hinges on the fact that these pilots had an average life expectancy of six weeks when they went into combat. Thus the pilots and those they loved learned to live ""for the moment"", as this film dramatises.Crowe is in charming mode as the Aussie trainee who falls for the young wife of a pilot already away at war.While overly earnest and somewhat clicheed in spots, this is a touching film that reminds us of the sacrifices made both by those who fought in World War II and the loved ones they left at home."
5,"Fair dinkum, this is definitely better than stamps!","I must say that this is Russell Crowe at his best. It's not often that you get to see him playing his true nationality. The story of Lill and Lachlan is true romance at its best. I especially enjoyed the underlying story of Betsy and Zeek and I couldn't help wanting to know more about these two characters. The scenery and the music in the film is breathtaking and the two love stories give an insight of what it must of been like in 1942 to only have a short time with the people you love. Living in the UK I don't get to see much of Russell Crowe's early stuff, but this is definitely one I've added to my video collection. If you like a good love story (and Russell Crowe), I'd recommend it to anyone!"
3,Russell Crowe finds love.,"Russell Crowe made this film just before his United States of America debut in L.A. Confidential (1997). Very nice and beautifully-filmed film set in West canada in 1942. Pilots-in-training find love with very nice women. Russell Crowe plays ""lachlan"" who is from Australia. He begins a nice friendship with a women (Christine Hirt) on a farm. it becomes a tender, forbidden romance. Lachlan wanted love and found it, even if it was for the moment. Incidentally, Russell Crowe found love too. In 2003, he married Danielle Spencer, whom he worked with in The Crossing (1990). They now have a newborn son."
5,Outstanding,"Without a doubt, the most valuable printed material I have ever read on the subject! This book is very user-friendly and packed with ""essential and practical"" day-to-day, country -to-country information. It is as though you have your own tour guide condensed into 300+ pages. It answers questions you didn't know to ask! Don't leave home without it!"
5,Perfect Size and Style,This is such a cute sugar bowl. Perfect size and a great addition to my Fiestaware collection. I have this in the Scarlett Red and it is such a stricking color. Thanks Amazon for such great packing.
4,Swaddling for Dummies,"I never managed to get the swaddling-with-a-blanket thing correct -- my bundles were always too loose to contain my very wiggly baby girl. These swaddlers bind her up like a little papoose! The placement of the Velcro is a little inconvenient, and she grew out of the small size in less that two weeks (she was 8.5lbs at birth), but I would recommend these for anyone who needs to swaddle but hasn't the knack."
4,"Great for when baby is too strong for a ""tucked"" swaddle...","I purchased two versions of this product when my daughter was born. The first purchase was of the fleece type Swaddle Me, and I DO NOT recommend that version. I found that because the fleece material ""gives"", she was able to wriggle free and thus defeat the purpose of keeping her snug.I HIGHLY recommend swaddling. It has worked well for us. In the beginning, though, I had to use a flannel blanket (42"" square) to swaddle -- this item was too big to swaddle snuggly.When my daughter reached about 3 months of age, she began to become too strong for the regular blanket swaddle and would break free (like the incredible Hulk!), so I purchased the FLANNEL version of the Swaddle Me product.The flannel version worked GREAT! The flannel fabric has less ""give"", so she could not escape as easily as she did with the fleece version. And, the velcro closures were great at holding her in. :)"
5,Keeps baby cool but snug,"I have a few other kiddopotmus swaddle me's, but this material is exactly what I was looking for. I was given the microfleece one as a gift, and two of the cotton flannel ones. I live in Hawaii so the microfleece one makes the baby over heat unless we cranked up the ac all night, the cotton flannel ones are good too, but a little too stretchy.My baby is now 10 lbs and the small size is still big on her and she loosens the whole thing pretty quickly. The cotton knit material however is perfect. It is soft but not really stretchy so it keeps the baby snug all night without overheating her! Plus its a cute design."
1,Waste of money,"I truly believe the swaddle, but with a real blanket. This was huge on my 7 lb 5oz son. It was way too loose fitting for the swaddle to work. Save 10 bucks and get a receiving blanket."
3,Shrinks in the wash,Probably works well for newborns and very small babies but my baby had outgrown it before she was 2 months old (11 pounds).
1,Not Good,My infant daughter got her arms free in about 60 seconds. It is not a well designed blanket.
1,Not for Newborns,"I bought this blanket when my son was 2 weeks old. He weighed about 8 and a half pounds at the time. It was way too big, and there was no way to get it tight enough to provide a snug, swaddled effect. I ended up buying this cool thing from etsy.com called a Swaddle Sleeve. It worked like magic and kept him swaddled for as long as he needed to sleep.I just pulled this blanket back out to try it again (my son is 15 weeks old now). It is still way too loose, and he isn't a particularly small baby. He probably weighs about 13 pounds now. He wiggled out of it in less than a minute."
2,"Good for tiny babies, but not big ones...","It's a very cute blanket (especially the teddy bear velcro tabs!), but as another reviewer has stated, it shrinks in the wash. My big 9-lb boy used it maybe two or three times before he didn't fit in it anymore. I finally put him in the large SwaddleMe today and he fits just fine (11 lbs, 23 inches long)."
2,Busting out!,"This is a great product for a few weeks, then the velcro gets really weak and your child will be busting out! I go in to find my son with both arms out and one leg out. No matter how tight I make the blanket, the velcro comes apart. I encourage you to buy their other SwaddleMe blanket with the larger velcro flap."
2,"Fleece ones are great, but this one shrank","I got a fleece version as a shower gift, and found it to be wonderful -- my daughter, now 5 weeks, sleeps best in it.I bought the flannel one thinking it would be good for naps when the room is a little warmer already. However, after washing it twice (and following the washing instructions), it is now an inch and a half smaller than the microfleece ones. My daughter is on the large side (she was 9 lbs at birth), and 1 1/2 inches doesn't seem like that much of a difference, but she can't wear the flannel one anymore. The velcro just barely doesn't reach.Love the fleece ones, very disappointed in this one."
4,we're very glad we have it,we first tried the swaddleme when we were still in the hospital and found our baby slept much better wrapped up. one issue was the velcro was annoying and woke him up whenever we had to change him and we stopped using it for a couple days. once we were home i tried again and found after a few washings the velcro was much quieter. now we use the swaddleme for night time and naps and LOVE it. it's really useful and fast. baby loves it too. he is just much more relaxed once he is swaddled. now that he's 2 months and 11 lbs he is starting to wiggle out and it's not fitting as well but we have a couple other bigger swaddles for him.it's very useful and i would recommend it to anybody. it would also make a great gift.
2,Not the best,"This particular swaddler is made of a thinner sheet material. It is smaller than the fleece swaddlers even though they are both ""smalls."" It would be good if your Newborn is born in summer months when its warmer and you don't need fleece, but my daughter was born in the middle of a very cold winter and we didn't use this one hardly at all."
1,Great Series at an outrageous price !,"I adore this show so do not be angry with this horrible rating. 200$ or more for a dvd where the other volumes are about 19$ ? You have to be kidding me with this, nobody is going to shell out that kind of money! If they lowered the price I'd buy this in a heart beat but for God sake 200$ you are out of your mind!"
4,Guilty pleasure,"At first I thought I was getting the original series, but this is new, no ""Hyata becomes...Ultraman!"". But it's still pretty good, as guys rolling around in rubber suits goes."
1,stinks,I'm on my 3rd one. Everyone self destructs after a few months. When it fails the On/Off relay switches rapidly and who-knows-what its doing to your expensive battery. I even put mine on a mechancical timer so that its only On an hour a day - still developed the problem. Time to suck it up and spend more money on a battery tender. I would not trust leaving the house with this thing plugged in - might come home to ashes!
1,DO NOT BUY/USE THIS POS!,"I'm a LCDR in the Navy and wanted something to maintain my vehicles while on deployment. After testing two of these on both cars, I quickly saw that they are wothless. The batteries were CONTINUOUSLY overcharged! Just for giggles and grins I allowed them to stay on for an hour or two and they still didn't turn off. You could literally hear the water being 'boiled' out of the battery on these units. Had I left them in, I'm positive they would have ruined the batteries and likely my house when the garage filled up with hydrogen and the blew the place up. STAY AWAY from these chargers. A little more $ will get you a reliable charger."
1,Junk,Did not shut off and ruined a $174.00 gel motorcycle battery. I will never purchase anything Black & Decker again.
1,Failed in less than 3 months,"I had one of these units, sold under the Vector brand name, fail in use after about three months for no obvious reason. It was hooked to the battery of a truck in long-term storage in a garage, in a benign environment. It's obviously of little use if one can't rely on it to keep a battery topped-off. Out of curiosity, I broke the seal and opened the unit. 120 VAC was still getting to the printed circuit and the on-board glass fuse was good, but the LEDs no longer lit up and there was no DC output. Something in the electronics simply failed.Based on other adverse reviews here, it's obvious that the design is deficient and these units are unreliable. I still need a trickle or float charger, but the replacement unit won't be one of these."
1,"Not good on AGM batteries, and causes some TV interference.","This B&D; float charger seemed to work OK on standard 12V automotive-type lead-acid batteries, but not on AGM types (sealed Absorbent Glass Mat, similar to GELs), although the box says it is also good for maintaining AGM and GEL batteries. When I tried it on an AGM the initial charge cycle was OK but then the following float charge dropped to at least 1 to 1.5 V less than what an AGM needs, resulting in a long-term undercharge while in maintenance mode. This will result in damage to AGM batteries, and probably gel-cells also.TV interference: while charging a battery it causes some picture hash on the lower channels of nearby TV sets that use an antenna, unless it's re-located far away from the antenna (this might not happen with TV's that are connected to cable or satellite systems). Well designed equipment should not have these problems. It was made in China, not here, which seems to explain a lot about quality these days."
