2,What a stupid ending!,"It takes a lot for me to stick with a book like this all the way through to the end. The story had good attention grabbing aspects in it and I hoped for the best for an exciting ending. IT NEVER CAME. The ending of this book was as uneventful as the movie version of Stephen Kings' ""Storm Of The Century"". The guts of it were good but what happened? Did the author get tired? Was it getting too close to the due date to turn the completed work over to the publisher? Did someone forget to put the last chapter in the book? I will not waste my time reading any other works by this author. He betrayed me when he left me with this dumb, thoughtless, closure-less ending."
3,"STRONG STORY, WEAK ENDING",I must admit this is the first Saul book I have read and I did so only under the pleading of my sister who is a huge fan. I very much enjoyed most of the book. It is an exciting story and told very well. I must say I was more then a little disapointed with the eneding. I was hoping for something a bit more substantial.
3,Was hoping for more,"I enjoyed a number of John Saul's other works, especially his serial novel a few years back, but this one left me very flat. Pedestrian plot, little suspense, weird POV glitches and a very disappointing ending. This story just never got it together and I found myself skipping paragraphs at points just to get through parts. I was hoping for more."
4,Entertaining read,"This is a fast-paced easy to read thriller. Maybe it is on the simple side & maybe redundant at times, however it was entertaining.I enjoyed the book, although I had a problem w/ the murderer being executed after only 2yrs from sentancing - TX doesn't even kill 'em that quick. Also, the whole ""Indian"" (Native American) stuff w/ Sheila Harrar just seemed...I don't know, but Mr. Saul could have done a better job w/ that topic."
2,very disappointing,This book tried to be too many different things. First believeable and then way too much unbelievable. The characters were shallow and uninteresting. There could have been so much more done with this storyline.
2,Great until the last 2 pages.....,"I thought this book was very interesting and exciting. I had a great time reading it until I got to the last two pages. I felt like the writer had become bored and just decided to end the book. Right now! I had to reread the last several pages to follow what had happened and still couldn't figure out why he dumped the book and the reader like that. Except for the last two pages I would have rated this a 4, but because of how he left me hanging...a 2 is all I can offer. I am not sure I can bring myself to read anything else he has written."
2,Black Lightning leaves alot to be desired,"As an avid John Saul reader I was disappointed in this book. I long for the days when Saul based his stories out of New England and concentrated on the psyche of his characters. Black Lightning is confusing from start to finish. It is only in the last two chapters that the reader can figure out what is going on. While that is fine in some suspense books, Saul is constantly losing the reader and jumping around too much to take this story seriously"
1,Worst Abridged Version Ever,"This abridged audio book is the worst I've listened to having been cut from over 400 pages down to 3 very short audio CDs.The story doesn't flow from one event to another, instead people dissappear during conversations, past conversations are referenced that never took place in the audio book, and people travel miles between one sentence and the next.To abridge this book they gave the paperback to a monkey in the zoo, let him randomly tear out pages, and what was left they gave to Lee Merriweather to read. It's a confusing mess.Never again will I purchase an abridged version of a book. I've read the book and all I can say is ""Poor John Saul""."
2,Trite&predictable,"I'm a big fan of John Saul, but ""Black Lightning"" was a disappointment.Within the first few chapters I recognized a plot premise that dates back as far as horror novels go. Anyone who has ever seen an episode of Twilight Zone will know what's going to happen w/in 50 pages.Think I'm being overly critical? Try this: Anne Jeffers is at a prison to witness the electrocution of serial killer Richard Kraven. At the exact moment of Kraven's death, Anne's husband has a near-fatal heart attack and is brought back from the jaws of death by use of a defibulator.If you can't tell what happens next, then buy this book."
1,Don't bother unless you're really bored.,"I don't know why I keep thinking John Saul will eventually write a good book. He is a mediocre author, and this is one of his less than mediocre books. Maybe he wrote a good one once that got him a really long contract with some unfortunate publishing company. I have yet to find it. I'm sure someone thinks he's brilliant, but anyone who reads Black Lightning looking for something twisted, mysterious, or horrifying should not bother with this book. It's just plain stupid. Don't bother with John Saul at all for that matter. I have read several of his and am tired of being disappointed. Curl up with Steven King on a stormy night if you want a true, well-written scare. Even his bad ones are better than Saul"
1,I DON'T GET IT!!!,"Forgive me. I heard all the hype, so I was eager to hear this comp. I'm not familiar with DNSS live shows, but the concept sounds highly entertaining.I do appreciate some seriously bad music, but I truly don't get this. I don't feel this at all. Like fake acid.I feel jipped. If I was less diplomatic I would say this is one of the suckiest CDs I've ever heard. However I probably don't get it. I get the feeling this is some in joke, or that I had to be there.I dig the Make Up, Blues Explosian etc. I believe my problem is with Dub Narcotic. There are plenty of psuedo funky joke bands out there. So I guess I will have to look else where.I don't mean to be cruel.... but Bloodhound Gang, and Insane Clown Posse are funnier.I'm really glad I listened to this CD before I bought it. I would certainly be less diplomatic if I bought this CD."
3,disappointed!,"Luckily, I read Time Station Paris first. This book was a disappointment. In my opinion, the author didn't use the time travel concept enough. Case in point: two time travelers were looking to catch five or six bad guys, but were worried about not having enough manpower. Simply get a small army of themselves from different futures! Instead, the two of them did not succeed in the capture, and let a few escape.I have no problem with far out concepts, if they are used to full advantage. The transporter on the Enterprise was never, IMO, used to it's fullest potential."
5,Fascinating Accounts,"This book is a fantastic account of feral children from Rev Singh's orphanage in Minapore,India. Illustrations are reproductions of old black and white photographs, which add to the value of the book. It was first published in 1942and contains journal entries documenting observations in an interesting and detailed way; one example is when he describes Kamala, a girl raised by wolves, being attracted to the swing at the orphanage.Other cases are also documented at the back of the book, which is a must have for researchers on feral children and cases of extreme isolation."
2,bummer,This is not a book for beginners. Most of it is plasters work with a few cabinets. They use the most expensive brushes you can't find anywhere and the paint they use doesn't even give the name of the maker. You'd search for that paint til the cows come home. Pretty pictures though.
2,Disappointed by this book,"I purchased this book partly because of the reviews that said this is not a beginner's book. As a professional, that appealed to me.I was disappointed in the book because I felt that half of the book was the exact same technique, just changing out the colors. I also found several of the cabinet finishes to be very messy looking. I was just expecting more . . . ."
5,Faux Made Fun,"Get out your paintbrush and have some faux fun with this advanced guide to faux painting. Fully of techniques and ideas, you'll want this in your library."
2,Won't Last Long,"This toy won't last long. It is basically two plastic cones and a long slinky-like spring. This gets tangled up easily, which makes the toy completely useless. Ours only lasted about 3 days, and I even made sure it got put away carefully."
2,Didn't lower my cholesterol,I read somewhere that Artichoke Leaf Extract would lower my cholesterol but it didn't work for me (at least this brand didn't)
3,"The original animation, but not the original actors.","This is the same Kimba that everyone fell in love with in the 60s, but because of legal problems the soundtrack has been replaced (that's the reason for the title change as well). This is a major disapointment for some of us. The new actors don't sound right, and Isao Tomita's music is gone as well. As much as two minutes has been removed from each episode (there are two episodes per tape). To their credit, they re-visited the original Japanese version when writing the voice parts and some of the dialog changes appear to be truer to the creator's intent. If you want to see the original Kimba TV show, there simply is no other home video available."

3,Caution!,"Although fascinating and while I applaud the effort, many of the lines in the book are incorrect. Some of the Ishams of Southern Lines are incorrectly tied to Ohio Ishams etc. Be careful if you are using it as your primary genealogical resource."
5,This is Great,"I received this book when it was just published, it was a gift. And this is the one book I treasure, second to the Family Bible. It is even fun to show the kids my name and all their family members in it. I think it is the best for anyone who is an Isham. Must have!"
2,Gentle but does not totally clean my skin.,"I bought this product after reading Sharon Stone used it . I have oily, acne prone skin and need a gentle but effective facial cleanser. I am switching to La Roche Posay which seems to work better for me ."
3,online for order but not physically in stock,"I was counting on this book for a class of mine, and now it has set me back a week and a half. Sucks.If it weren't for the other book i ordered and recieved i may have only gave them a single star."
3,some are great some is really boring,"i liked some of the revies and stories in this book but there were also some stories not worth the time, love the lou reed one, i almost only bougth this book for the lou reed interview, but theres some stooges the too"
1,Are you kidding me?,"Sorry, but this book totally sucks. The ""angular"" writing is nothing more than unbridled ramblings. Bangs often struggles to develop a singular, cohesive theme about a particular band other than writing about the band itself (kind of). The chapters read like every cliche music feature written post-Bangs in Rolling Stone, Spin, and various other rock mags. In a sense, you can't blame Bangs for being that influential, but still, for current-day readers, it's as if you've read his work a thousand times already. I really wanted to like this book, but there's just very little to get excited about. You're much better off reading a good blog about a particular band."
2,Was he serious?,"Interesting bathroom reading. But those of us who have grown up will see it for what it is. Glorified navel-gazing: ""This music was IMPORTANT because I was around to see it."" The book serves as an interesting time capsule. Reading this, one can smell the weed, taste the day-old pizza, see the semen-stained poster of Kerouak on the wall, hear the inebriated Mr. Bangs talking to himself at 3 a.m. Hey, it's was just music. A bunch of kids banging their guitars around. I loved it and still love it. But my guess is anyone who really feels it is important that The Troggs receive their props hasn't made much of a life for himself in the decades since."
1,the man who ruined rock?,"Lester Bangs is guilty of being one of the most pretentious and detrimental rock critics in the history of the gloriously varied musical genre. His narrow-minded opinion and self-impressed need to pose as a tastemaker frequently undermined the efforts of truly talented and generous musicians. Bangs, himself an inept hack of a writer and a shallow wader in the ocean of wisdom, could only understand and praise simplistic music. Why do I villify him? Simple - because he was a villain."
2,Bangs was an over-rated hack,"Lester Bangs is enormously over-rated. Perhaps among rock critics he was above average, but as a writer he was a hack. His style is one of the most annoying I've ever encountered. The funny thing is, I wrote just like Bangs when I was 14 -- and that's not bragging. Rather, it suggests that Bangs wrote like a whiny, pretentious, pseudo-intellectual, neurotic, self-satisfied, egotistical 14-year old who neve grew up. The style is a sort of uninhibited stream-of-consciousness which becomes tiring very quickly. Plus, it's not very funny.On the other hand, I did appreciate the historical aspect of some of the articles, particularly the perspective they provide on early punk. Ultimately, however, there is, as they say, as little point in reading about music as in tap-dancing about painting."
5,The Microphone is worth it,"I was skeptical on paying this much for a guitar pickup, but it was very much so worth it. The microphone is what really makes this pickup great. It gives the guitar's sound that airy, natural, sparkling sound to it. I absolutely am in love with it. I try to use as much microphone as possible in whatever situation I am in.I've never owned a guitar pickup before, but I know a good-sounding sound system when I hear it, and this pickup can be a part of one."
5,Love this seasoning,"I grew up using this seasoning on steak, and pretty much everything. Could no longer find it in stores so ordered a case off amazon. Very happy nice spice and flavor. Highly recommend."
5,Good on Everything,"I originally discovered this years ago on vacation in southern Maryland. Since then it's always been in our cupboard. We came home to PA that year with three cans of it and then resupplied each summer. After a couple of years it became available in our area, but in the last year or so, we haven't been able to find it anywhere. This is one seasoning I don't mind buying by the case. (and it's a great price, too!)We put it on virtually anything - and I mean anything. Meats, poultry, seafood, salads, spaghetti, eggs, pot pie, vegetables, soups, whatever. It's especially good on any pasta dish. I even sprinkle it on a sandwich. The spice is just the right amount of heat with the touch of lemon to top it off. It sounds weird but I think I could even enjoy this on ice cream."
5,Amazing Man,"I know the Sijan family, and could never imagine feeling what they still feel today regarding their lost son and brother. I am 25 years old, the same age of Lance when he was shot down. I feel sorry for people my age who do not and cannot understand what these amazing men and women did, just so we could have a secure future. Lance never gave up, his struggle and will to survive should serve as an example to anyone who wants to overcome anything. This is my second time reading this book, I think it should be required reading by every High School in America, so they will never forget, I know I won't."
4,Wow! What a great video!,"I jst finished watching a terrific little documentary on those crazy Beanies...what a lot of help it was! I'm just starting out as a collector, and I plan on using this video whenever I make a Beanie purchase...highly recommended!"
1,Not as Pictured,"Nasty looking vent on top of cap, no internal arch ribs. Accel has fallen from grace with cheap replacement parts."
1,Trusted old friend is gone,"I must agree with another reviewer in that I am very disappointed with the 'NEW' Grammar in Action. The wonderful simplicity of the series which made it unique is gone. It appears that in an attempt to hve the book mesh with their other titles, the publisher wanted make it look like every other textbook. And that is what they have done. My trusted old friend of a beginner ESL/EFL book is gone."
2,I am disappointed,"I have used the orginal Grammar in Action books, and I am very disappointed in this one. The wonderful, clear simple pictures are missing and have been replaced with tiny crowded ones, or worse, no pictures at all!"
3,"Outdated material, inadequate maps","My family and I used this book on our trip to Kauai. The reviews were sometimes helpful but this island is changing so rapidly that a lot of the material is outdated. The maps are okay for general use, but don't use them to navigate. Pick up one of the free maps handed out to find your way, or you will get lost."
2,Godzilla - Mainia... don't be fooled!,"This video looks like it was thrown together in 2 minutes. The opining music dosen't sound at all like Godzilla music. How many times can you use the same picture of Willis O'Brien. 4 times to be exact. It's like theres no other pictures availible. Alot of the information in this movie is toatally wrong! The only thing that saves this tape is that is has the original ""Godzilla vs. Megalon"" trailer that I have never seen. It's like a monster movie documentrey for pre-schoolers. ""Was Godzilla the first monster movie ever made?"". What a stupid question!"
5,Lots of exercises.,Got writer's block? You won't after being inspired by all the wonderful approaches to triggering writing ideas in this book. 63 exercises in all categorically grouped in a sensible format. Includes encouragement and instruction on keeping a writer's journal.
1,READ THIS!!! DON'T buy this gun,"I don't know where to start. Fisrt this gun looked cool and shot hard but the part i really liked was the metal gear box which i thought would cause it not to break. I ordered two and one came broken and the second made a high pitch gear grinding noice after about 500 shots and wuold no longer shoot. So i sent them back and got two more (I figured that i would give this gun a second chance and what are the odds that any more guns could be bad, right). Wrong! The next two i got both ground there gears in the exact same way after about 500 shots. I even followed all of thier rules like oiling, good bbs, and avioding extended periods of shooting. This gun is the biggest piece of crap that u will ever buy. TRUST ME, DON'T BUY THIS GUN!!! If u buy it u will regret it. Everything that i have said is true and i really hope that this gets posted to warn other potential buyers"
2,Don't know why they made this film,This was a grim tale which never really went anywhere. Even such potentially beautiful country as the Pacific Northwest was underutilized!
4,"Awesome TV, awesome sound!","While not as great as a Sony Wega as far as picture is concerned (gee, big surprise), this TV is awesome.Stereo sound is really great, the picture is sharp and clear, and it even looks cool. This is a really great TV, and I know I'll be very happy with it."
4,Good cover.,"Three sided zipper made it very easy to put on the futon mattress.This fit my six inch mattress perfectly.It's durable, and strong.It feels a bit rough though, so I still felt the need to put a bed sheet on over it.Great buy."
1,pop punk zombies,"i ejected after 10 long worthless minutes & i love "" b"" zombie movies, wowDO NOT WASTE ANY OF YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY !!"
1,God awful,"Coming from someone who LOVES bad horror movies... this one is utter garbage. The acting is god awful, the soundtrack is god awful, the makeup is... okay, I suppose. Thankfully, I got free credits to watch this thing. Don't waste your money unless you've seen everything else."
4,Good practice blades.,These practice broad head blades fly pretty much the same as the field points and the for-real broadhead blades. Thats all I was asking.
1,Muzzy 100 Practice Blades!!!,"I gave this webpage 1 star, NOT the product. Muzzy products are GREAT, and the fact that they make practice blades to use makes these broadheads even better, so they would get 5 STARS. This webpage is all screwed up though! For those that are confused like me:The TITLE of this page is accurate. These are the practice blades for the Muzzy 100 3-blade broadheads that are available in a 6-pack. These are NOT the practice blades for the newer MX-3 100 grain broadheads as the item description states. There are 18 practice blades in this set (3 per broadhead x 6 broadheads). This is the lowest price online I have found for this item...too bad Amazon has such a hard time providing an accurate description of archery products."
1,Muzzy Broadhead,The picture online is of a muzzy broadhead with hunting blades. I recieved practice blades that are not sharp and cannot be used for hunting. The picture needs to be updated and the description needs to be made more clear.
2,not really worth it,"first it is black not camo which made me mad, also pretty cheap and flimsy. i would suggest spending the $4 more and getting the one with tubes in it wish i did, also you can get the same thing at walmart for cheaper but i guess it is what it is and works"
3,archery equipment,It works good. I thought I was getting a quiver that had a shoulder strap but this is good too.
4,cookie presses,Good quality but it must take practice to imprint cookies right. Some of mine were perfect; others you couldnt tell what the design was.
2,"Outstanding for the UK ... for the US, expensive and less relevant ...","I lived in the UK (East Kent) for two years and subscribed to Kitchen Gardens. It was marvelous -- advice on what grew in my area, what to do in the garden this month, new plant varieties, new seed offers, experience of other UK gardeners in challenging environments, the restructuring of medieval kitchen gardens -- in short, a wonderful read and guide to kitchen gardening in the UK.And at GBP 3 per issue, quite reasonably priced ... but $100 for 6 issues, describing seeds we are unlikely to get, growing conditions unlike what we deal with, shows (and garden tours) we can't attend ... it's still a great read, but its utility is vastly reduced and one has to wonder about the cost/benefit ratio ...I decided that as much as I loved it in the UK, it's a pass in the US. Sorry ..."
5,Effective yet economical trap,"I have used these glue traps in two ways, as stand alone (as shown in the product description) and as inserts into pro-ketch brand traps. They work quite effectively in either case. I have placed bait in the center of each trap to aid in capturing mice, but if you place the traps properly, no bait is needed. There are many glue traps on the market, and I have tried many of them, but I have found none that trap and hold mice as effectively and for such an economical price."
5,These sticky pads REALLY work!,"We are having a HUGE problem with Springtails. They are coming in by the hundreds! At least we can catch some with these sticky pads, but am at my wits end with trying to control these teeny tiny lil moving things! The exterminator has been coming out weekly and spraying, but nothing seems to be getting rid of them. If ANYONE has an answer for us please message me!"
4,Very effective,We are very pleased with this product. We had a terrible roach problem. We had an exterminator come in and he left three of these traps in our kitchen to see if the roaches returned. The traps caught the remnants of these loathsome bugs. So we bought a supply and have kept some in our kitchen ever since. We have caught several over the weeks but nothing like the infestation we used to have!
3,Black and White,"While I admire and relate to the words of Merton, I find his style rather sharp. He seems to define his experience and spirtuality well (which I relate), but then seems to trash others or society that functions differently. Certainly society is very ill and could benefit from Merton type teachings, but this constant contrast seems to put himself (and spiritually commited people) apart from everyday people. When we (I) am living in an everday world, it makes me feel stuck between his teachings and those whom he blasts. Still, I am enjoying the teachings of the book. I simply need to accept his style and take what the book offers (which is indeed rich in spirituality)."
3,Contemplative thoughts from an American Mystic,"This is one of many books by Merton which looks at contemplative Christianinty. It is considered one of his foundational works, but the shorter Thoughts in Solitude is easier reading. This is for someone more advanced in the contemplative field."
2,Not for everyone,"Instead of inspiring me (as he has clearly done for many readers), Merton more often left me frowning and scratching my head. While this book contains some gems, I can understand how the reader from Florida saw it as ""mumbo jumbo."" For starters, Merton is not exactly a skilled writer (he admits as much in his introduction). His writing is often frustratingly vague and disconnected. Moreover, his calls for strict adherence to Catholic dogma and for perfect Christians to become communists were a bit off-putting to this layperson. Perhaps at a different point in my life, I might find it wonderfully inspiring. But as an early guide in my contemplative journey, Merton was more of a stumbling block than a stepping stone."
2,a limited view,"If you are interested in contemplation/meditation but not interested in God or Christ, this book has very little to offer, in spite of having been written by a major thinker. Alan Watts' works (e.g.,You're It!: On Hiding, Seeking, and Being Found (Alan Watts Archive)Behold the Spirit: A Study in the Necessity of Mystical Religion) are vastly superior alternatives."
1,Mumbo Jumbo,"This is supposed to be a great spritual book. I found the author to be hopelessly lost in a bunch of words which mean nothing. This is one of those ""spiritual"" books that are really the result of the author bewitching himself with the trappings of language. I think that Merton actually believes that he is saying something when all he is doing is using vaguely defined words and terms which can mean anything-or absolutely nothing (the more likely possibility). If you think that sitting in complete silence and solitude for hours on end is the way to learn something, get this book. If you think that that is the way to delude yourself and possibly go mad as a hatter, skip this one. Read one ""mystical"" treatise, and you have read them all. If ""contemplation"" is such a great way to gain knowledge, why is it that all of these books say the same insipid things?"
2,Not Marguerite Henry!,"I bought this book because I enjoy books by Marguerite Henry ('Misty of Chincoteague', etc.). I thought that with this particular book she included her married last name or something.This book is not written by Marguerite Henry Wolf. It is by Marguerite Hurrey Wolf. Big difference. I FEEL LIKE IT IS FALSE ADVERTISING. I am unlikely to purchase from this bookseller in the future.The book is somewhat interesting. Pretty well written. From a first person point of view. Just personal anecdotes about living in Vermont. But obviously published on a very low budget. Almost like hand-made, based on the exterior. Also a poor font.Kudos to the author if it was a first attempt at writing and publishing a book. However, very disappointing for someone expecting to receive an old hardcover Marguerite Henry novel."
5,five star,"If you are a fan of Waterhouse, get this book. It contains most of his well known works, which are reproduced very nicely. The book itself is also very attractive, and quite reasonably priced, considering what it is. Just get it, lest it become unavailable."
3,Reproduction only okay.,"I expected a lot based on the other reviews, and although I have not read the text, I was dissapointed with many of the reproductions in this book... some are washed out, other's have glare from the photogrpher's lights. I saw many of these paintings in person on a recent trip to the UK, and I know it could have been a lot better. It's too bad because Waterhouse deserves a book par excelence."
4,Great table book,"Would love to have ordered the hardcover for a coffee table book but this one does just fine for the cost and over-seas shipping it would have taken for the hardcover. Lots of information on J W Waterhouse and great pictures. It even has some of his less known works and pictures that you can't find prints for. A true keep sake and treasure for those who are interested in this artist and his time. Oh, and a few of the house guests, students, have even asked to borrow the book. First table book to have created some interesting conversations."
5,An astute feel for a quiet man,"Peter Trippi's monograph has done what I would assume had to be very difficult to do: he has a good feel for the quiet,quiet man behind the paintings. The depth of his study helped me to verify a number of pieces of information that led me into my own research, and has continued to be my main reference as I continue my work. I recommend that this is the book to begin with if you are going to enter any serious study of John William Waterhouse; however, don't let that make you think it is only a scholar's read: it is well written, beautifully illustrated, and simply a joy to behold."
1,The Looky,Visual field too narrow to be worth the cost while it would need to be much bigger to be wider then it would be too large to drag with you. Haven't found a portable device that fits the bill and I've tried few at $800+.
4,I saw this guy in Amsterdam,I can see why the people in Amsterdam keep having this guy come back year after year with a soulfull feel and real attention to detail his music is relaxing and inspiring. A breath of fresh air in the southeren rock/country genre. You can't compare his music to anyone else and I hope to hear more of him in the future.
3,Nero Mix,I got this to make CDs with mp3 files and i haven't been able to make a single CD with it. I tried it on at least 3 computers and they all had a different error reason for it not to burn the CD. I would not buy this again
5,Works great in my Ford Edge 2009,"I bought this one for my Ford Edge 2009. This works absolutely great. It is really safe, easy to install and uninstall.Package I bought: Thule RB53 Rapid Aero Aluminum Roof Rack Load Bars (53-Inch, Set of 2), Thule 1530 Fit Kit for 480 Traverse and 480R Traverse Foot Pack, Thule Rapid Traverse Foot Pack (Set of 4), Thule 544 Lock Cylinders for Car Racks (4-Pack). Everything fits properly. I am really happy, this gives me a lot of help so that I can have plenty of options to adjust to this system. Actually I am using the: Thule 630 Ranger 90 Rooftop Cargo Bag (Rack Mounted) that is absolutely great."
4,Love it!,"This is the perfect chiffon skirt for class. I have it in three colors now! Periwinkle, seafoam, and black. When I wear the black with black tights and a colored leo, my legs look really long and slim! It's a short skirt, so don't expect a lot of coverage, but it's just enough to elongate lines! The periwinkle is a GORGEOUS color, and I love it. The chiffon is nice, but not amazingly flowy (thus the four star review). But you get what you pay for in materials. Love the colors though and it is the perfect length to make your legs look gorgeous. Plus the taper from front to back is just enough so it doesn't do that weird thing down to the backs of your knees, it is just so it will go over your butt and keep a straight line at the hem. I think it's the perfect skirt."
4,"Bright, Fun, Unique Pop-Rock","I caught these guys on their recent tour (at San Francisco's Bottom Of The Hill) and picked up this recording. I really didn't know what to expect, except for the ""Athens"" vibe which was apparent from the first note (more like Let's Active or a less self-aware Dbs than, say, the B-52s). They're a fun bunch of folks to watch, and this record never gets boring. Go see 'em if you can!"
5,Very Pleased,"This book arrived aerlier than expected which was a huge surprise. It arrived safe and sound in near mint condition. There were some light signs of usage but all the information is readable. It also included a hidden image puzzle as well as a book mark. (I over exaggerate they were left in there but it was still kind of cool.) Long story short, all thumbs up, I got a $200 book for $15 and it excedeed my highest expectations."
1,"ewe, gross!","This manual disenfranchises all that is interesting about human nature. We professionals are all aware it was created for insurance coding, but it has somehow contaminated the less intelligent careerists in our ranks (which is just about all of us), who are susceptible to its suggestion, and we now find ourselves using this caricature tabloid like a map of the psyche itself. This manual is the cause and effect of an anti-intellectual strain of professionalism that has all but replaced scholarship and reflection. If this were the Bible, we would all be guilty of evangelical fundamentalism. When we consider the thousands of professionals (working on task forces and subcommitees) that produced this megillah, a principle from a neighboring behavioral discipline comes to mind, i.e. freedom and intelligence in individuals -- indeed consciousness itself -- is inversely proportional to the size of the group in which they participate. Psychology is all but officially a sham discipline."
4,Thank You Tuscon & Bowling Green,"Thanks to the reviewers from Tuscon & Bowling Green who point out that this is only a tool that attempts to codify the many mental states we collectivly term mental disorders. As a clinician I find it useful as a quick refererence but it doesn't replace good case studies, in depth works and clinical experience."
4,DSM - IV is a manual for use by mental health professionals,"DSM-IV is a manual for use by mental health professionals so that there is uniformity in diagnosis and basis for future research. Each diagnosis has been subject to extensive research. DSM-IV only describes symptoms and does not discuss causes for disorders. I would agree with the other reader that I would like to see diagnosis related to anger disorders appearing in future editions. Because there is political concern about anger disorders being used as criminal defenses, the mental health community has been somewhat reluctant to formalize diagnosis in this area. I feel, however, this is important so that the mental health community can be more active in reasearch on anger disorders to provide more effective treatment in this area."
5,great for the inquistive layman,"learned a lot about the people who surround me....family friends and coworkers..not giving advice, but helps to understand addictictive behavior, personality \ and bi polar disorderhighly recommend for the curious and intelligent mind"
2,"This is a hoot, its like reading a book thats cluless about the human condition.","I was going thru this manual and found it so subjective that it is way beyond sublimely incredulious, a sane person would laugh until his sides would ache, and if it is used as widely as promoted it becomes insidious as a methoid for labling people. I suspect the next volume (lets hope that does not happen) will list every thing as a disorder. If any rational person uses this as a professional txt then there is a hidden agenda he wants to promote. It is clear what the APA wants for others and it's not for your health."
4,"Like it or not, it's the DSM","If you are going to counsel people, you really have to have a copy. So, here's the copy you have to have."
1,Yuck,I was really excited to get this book. When I opened the package it reaked of cigarette smoke. I immediately put it back in the package and haven't opened it since. :( I have not heard from the people I bought it from.
4,This is the definitive book for diagnosing mental disorders.,"The DSM-IV is the cookbook method of diagnosing mental disorders. The cookbook method is atheoetical in nature. The DSM-IV contains symptom lists, demographic, prevelance rates, and expected course of the disorder. The cookbook approach is useful for the experienced clinician because the diagnosis can be used across different theorectical treatment schools. The inexperienced clinician can be overwhelmed by the enormity of the manual. The information provided in the DSM can be useful for standardizing psychopathology research. I would recomend another introductory textbook about psychopathology as supplimentary to the DSM to groud the clinician in a particular theoretical model. Overall, I am pleased with the outcome of the DSM-IV, but I would want a more theoetical approach to supplement this cookbook of mental disorders."
5,Still a classic,"Even though there are newer DSM's, this one contains the classic diagnoses that non-psychiatrist physicians (and billing and coding programs) consistently refer to. This is the one that was published before all the ""politically correct"" wording and renaming occurred (BPD = ""Affective Dysregulation Disorder,"" my a##!). My original DSM IV disappeared in the last move, and since it was out of print, I was worried I wouldn't find another. Thanks, Amazon!"
1,It Stinks,I purchased this and can't stand it. The vacuum seal isn't strong and despite the manual saying you can seal cereal bags etc. it only works with a very specific bag that comes with it that has these lines on the inside. What a waste of money!
2,Eh,I didn't really like this game when I started playing it. I thought it was going to be more fun than what it was but I was wrong. Game works though. I might turn around and sell it.
1,Really sick game,"This games is sadistic, grotescus, an INSULTING FOR THE SONIC fans this is the worst game of sonic legacy,the graphics are a little good but the game doesn't have a history in fact when i finish the game i don't belive this the really end of the game, the music is HORRIBLE, and the GAMEPLAY SLASHY,STRASHYAND and confusing, all the reviwers say the game is great is beacuse they don't what to admit their 50 bucks going down, belive me if you want a really sonic game buy the great original hits games of sega like Sonic Adventures 2 Battle or Sonic Adventures DX but if you want to buy it okay the 50 dollars are not mine wahaha..."
1,What's the Point???,"What is the point of all the swearing in this game? I played with my 10 year old son for 10 minutes, and heard expletives about 10 times. I was also surprised by the amount of violence - very non-Sonic like.I'm absolutely ticked off by this game, and the trash the makers of Sonic have pushed on us. I'm sorry we bought it. I am not raising my kids in a gutter, and this game belongs there! And it will not stay in my house!!!"
1,What is wrong with everybody?!,"I'm 13. So some parents don't like ""damn"" or ""hell"", but honestly, one video game by a beloved company that goes off the beaten path to something new has to be beaten down like this. Oh boo hoo. If you go into my school, which is a good school, you'll hear more bad words than ever if you played this game. Also, the only time you hear ""damn"", is when Shadow dies. So unless you don't understand that jumping off cliffs is BAD, then you won't hear it very much. And, on a final note, if you don't want to have your kids exposed to ANY bad words, then get rid of all forms of communication, throw away the tv and electronics, books, board up the windows and doors, and don't let your child out of the house. If your child accidentally says a bad word, and then you go blame it on this game, then that is just messed up. And finally, 1 star is not my true rating, and I gave it 5 stars through and through!"
2,very boring,"I think this game is so boring. All you do is run around in hover shoes and pick up guns to shoot people or aliens, you swear every time you get hurt, and you can run around dying easy. I don't know who made this game, but I addmit I like the music. The rest is all very very very very very boring. I think this game was a waste to buy. But if you like cool music, buy this game and listen to the music, but don't play the game itself."
1,"Sega, get real. Why are you recking this game.","My name is connor and i was going to get this, until i used my brains. i read some reveiws and according to what i read: bad language, swords and guns, unusefull bad music. one of the reveiws said bad language is every where, that really got me MAD! i'm a christan and dont think that i dissagree with all games. i have a cube and own quite a bit of games including lord of the rings, and two other rated T's the rest are E's. i also own sonic adventure battle 2 and its great! but sega has gone too far and neads to stop NOW! becouse there are angry parents that wish they wouldn't of bought this game. so my advise is to buy a older sega game."
1,Not for young kids,"We bought this game for our son who loves the Sonic series. However, as others have said, the game includes frequent swearing so we no longer allow him to play it. The game also has a very ""dark"" feel to it, which I realize was part of the game creator's intent. IMO the game should be rated ""T""."
1,E 10 rating is completely wrong,"Parents stay away from this one. This game should have a more mature rating. Sonic says ""dammit"" constantly. Shawdow the Hedgehog has the most gratuitous use of foul language I have ever seen in a video game! Big thumbs down to Sega and the ESRB."
1,Not pleased with Hedgehog's E Rating,"I'm sorry, but I do not think Sonic the Hedgehog should have been rated E. I don't think 9 year old boys should be hearing ""damn"" and ""hell"" in video games. Call me a prude if you want, but it's got to stop somewhere. This one's going back to the store. More parents need to listen to and watch these games to see what their kids are playing."
3,Parents Beware...,"My 10-Year Old Loves It; I Don't. I wish I had read some reviews before purchasing it for my son, but it was rated E-10. He loves the game, but I would never have bought it for him if I had realized that the ""mild"" language indicated on the packaging included repeated use of ""damn"" and ""hell."" I really think this game should have received a ""Teen"" rating."
2,Parents beware of foul language,"Shame on Nintendo for releasing this game and promoting it as appropriate for ages 10 and up!!! Why in the world did they take a wholesome franchise like Sonic the Hedgehog and add unnecessary cursing? Parents, note--the words ""hell"" and ""damn"" are strewn in with the dialogue with alarming frequency. We returned our game to the store and they refunded our money. Just be aware that there is no way to squelch the curse words, and why should we be exposing our kids to even more smartmouth language than they already hear? My wife and I were sorely disappointed...plus the rating of E10 is a joke. This should be for teenagers or older only."
5,NOT a Sonic the Hedgehog game!!,"For all the horrible ratings on this game for bad language and straying from the other Sonic the Hedgehog games because of use of weapons and vechicles, people must keep in mind that THIS IS NOT A SONIC THE HEDGEHOG GAME!!!!!Get youst to it!!It is only suppose to have a LITTLE of that Sonic touch in it.....jees.Yes, it should have been rated T, but it was ment to not be like Sonic the Hedgehog that much.It has a very good storyline and is an AWESOME game, so if you like Shadow.......BUY THIS GAME!!!!"
2,Shadow The Hedgehog GameCube,This item was shipped according & was in good condition. Some of the levels are difficult. The special effects are good.
1,Please don't buy this game!,"I bought this game for my almost 10 year old son. He put it in Christmas morning and out came this horrible language. I purchased a game rated E 10+ not M. We don't talk like that in our household and I do not appreciate Sega bringing this into my home. I was misled and I want my money back! I have a 4 year old who loves to watch his brother play video games. That is not what I want him learning. The bad language is every few seconds, not that it is appropriate any time, but this is ridiculous. Please don't buy this game and send a message that this is unacceptable for our children. This game is not rated correctly!!!"
1,Highly disappointed,"I am very disappointed in this game. I have been playing Sonic almost all my life and I've seen nothing like this one. My siblings wanted to rent this game the other night and thinking it was like the others, we rented it. I saw that it was rated E 10+ so I told them that I had to play it first and make sure it was OK. When we got home, I stated to playing. I turned it off in less then 15 minutes due to the swearing and gun violence. This game is pretty much Doom or Grand Theft Auto for 10 year olds. I heard more cussing in 15 minutes of playing that game then I have heard in a rated R movie. I don't think it should be rated what it is. This game is NOT for children under the age of 13. Parents, PLEASE DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS GET THIS GAME!!!"
2,uhhhh............,"this was a very intrsting game.Shadow had to use firearms to get through the level,something new for the sonic series.But i mean come on to my house for bacon ho ho ho happy easter!Shadow can;t be the ultimate life form iff he kneads weapons.this was a big dissapointment for me.I was excpecting fast gamplay.I bet you disagrree but this of a good 40 dollers.Its fun at first but then your in total shock like what happend.THEY CUSS IN THE GAME.you should be aware of that before you buy."
1,Senseless Language,What is the point of all the swearing in this game? It adds nothing and ruins the game for the yournger kids.
5,This ROCKS,"This game rocks. It's hard, fun, and lots of action. You can do anything in this game. You ride in cool cars and lots of other things. If I were a teacher I'd give it a big fat A+. I'd give it to people anywhere. Guns and fun here. Pick good or evil,you choose. I'd give it (...)thumbs up."
1,A slap in the face to Sonic fans everywhere.,"Are you a long-term Sonic fan? Would you like to feel like Sega shafted you in favour of casual gamers and GTA fans? Here's your game. A transparent, cynical, cold-hearted, rushed cash-grab, an inferior version of existing Sonic games with a blatantly tacked-on gun system to sell to the OMGLOLGUNZRCOOL crowd. Buy Sonic Rush instead; that's a Sonic game. I'm not offended by the language or the violence; I'm offended by the lack of respect this game shows to the Sonic franchise."
5,Yipeeeeeeeeeeeeeee,"This game rocks. I love it alot. The only thing I wish (and it doesn't affect the WHOLE, entire game) is that I wish that Sega had made a M (17+) rated Shadow the hedgehog for ALL of the game systems where blood flies out of the aliens and as well as the human solders. That would be very cool. I'd buy both of the rated versions. Anyways. THIS GAME ROCKS!!!!!!! I hope Sega will make a Shadow the hedgehog 2 (with a Mature rated (M)) game and a E10+ one.Here are my ratings: (out of 10)Graphics 10Camera 8-10Violence 4-5 (tiny amount of blood flies of the black solders)Key searching 7Missions 10Weapons 10vehicles 9-10Overall 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000I also like the checkpoint warping."
1,Stupid,This game is so stupid! No Sonic related games (That I know of) has guns! Shadow cures all the time! How is this this E10 game! After this Sonic went down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Sega should have never made this game! The endings are awful!(Yes there are three awful endings.) One he thinks he;s a robot!!! The other two and JUST AS STUPID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I would rather play Hotel Mario (that's another story}
1,Shadow Hedgehog GameCube Game,"TOTALLY UNNECESSARY STRONG LANGUAGE is used throughout the game. This game should have been given at the least a ""T"" rating. My local game store was kind enough to let me exchange it."
1,THIS GAME SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,FIRST OF ALL THE CHARACTERS ARE VERY TINY SO IT'S HARD TO SEE WHO THE HELL YOU ARE AND PLUS WHAT'S UP WITH THESE HORRIBLE GRAPHICS?! sECOND PEOPLE SAY THE MUSIC IS GOOD WHILE I SAY IT SUCKS TOO. pRACTICLY THE WHOLE GAME IS TREMENDOUSLY STUPID. IF YOUR A SONIC FAN DON'T EVEN BOTHER TO BUY THIS GAME. i WOULD RATHER PLAY HELLO KITTY BUBBLE GUM GIRLFRIENDS THAN THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I HOPE YOU TAKE MY ADVICE.
5,All you Shadow lovers out there! This is the game!!!,Kids don't listen to that christian. I am christian and there is nothing wrong. THis game rules! SHadow's past is open to us! All of you shadow fans have to buy this! Here are the ratingsStory:10Fun: 10Difficulty:10Graphics:9.5Sound: 10!!!!COntrols:10( It is very good controls. But it is a little hard to know all.)Gameplay: 10Overal grade: 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000!!!!BUY THIS GAME! THIS IS THE YEAR OF SHADOW!!!
4,This ERSB rating should be a more mature rating.,"Too short! Your out with a rifle shooting aliens and people! Theycus and there's alot of gory, bloody, violent scenes! Reminds meof Grand Theft auto vice city, a real great game though!"
1,stop dissing my reviews,"hey little kids stop dissing my reviews. you can't say there not helpful, if the game sucks. to see the truth about this lackluster game, visit www.gamespot.com. it's the truth about this game. ps. i am hard rocker tom."
4,a great blast,"extreme graphics,guns, destroy anything in your way like cars few buildings and much much more. Tired of walking on foot drive 3 different vehicles. Thousands of different storylines. Excellent music too. listen to the ingame music in options menu.Replay all of the levels. I gave it 4 stars because the last video is sad."
4,prealgerbra skills workbook,"it's a good book tells you how to work problems, gives good examples etc i think maybe it could have been a little more specific in certain areas, maybe a few more examples but all in all great author, great book."
3,Overrated. Question the Hype.,"I've owned this CD for more than a month now and it still hasn't made a huge impact. Two songs, ""When a Man is Wrong"" and ""Lost my Faith"" are truly great songs, but other than those I would gladly toss the rest aside. Unlike the 2nd album which really had depth and character, this one attempts to go deeper into human emotion but has only exaggerated it. If you like this kind of music, try ""Postcards from Heaven"" by Lighthouse Family, now that one is orders of magnitude worth buying than this one."
5,Just like you said....,"I'm a huge Seal fan and was disappointed the first time I heard this album. Needless to say by my third listening I fell in love with it. It's a moody, symphonic, beautiful piece of work. And if you don't like the album that much by it simply for the song ""Just Like You Said""... I'm willing to bet that'll be Seal's next big hit, even if not, it's probably the most incredible song i've heard in a long time."
3,A mediocre entry from a great talent,"For those of us who loved Seal's first two albums, his third leaves something to be desired. While the album isn't bad per se, it lacks the power and imagination displayed on Seal's earlier efforts. While the lyrics are powerful, the music is banal. Even after listening to the album a few times none of the songs really stand out. After a four year wait this album was really a disappointment."
5,Real Art Requires Patience!,"I wonder if one of the definitions of a ""work of art"" is something that doesn't immediately appeal to you, but grows on you over time, like a fungus. The power of these melodies begin to infiltrate your senses after a few listens and the effect is hypnotic. Even more moving than his previous release (if that is possible), this album has shown itself to be just as solid as his first two. Since four years have passed, it's just about time for Seal to work his magic once again, and for that I'll be waiting. Heartbreak never sounds so good as from the mouth of Seal!!"
4,It was great,I would have to say that Seal has put together a great CD three times in a row. I had to wait four years to heard this new one but it was worth it. I hope the fifth does not take long. It was a great album.
1,Totally disappointing...,"I just don't like it!!! It always took 2 to 3 listens before I finally got the ""hook"" on Seal's cd's, but this one just doesn't seem to have one. Seal always had this incredible gift for taking the most depressing subject matter & putting a positive twist on it - but not in this case. I had to FORCE myself to listen to the entire cd both times I listened to it (in my desperate attempt to find SOMETHING I liked) - I just couldn't stand it."
1,waste,This album was not worth the wait or money. It really too bad because his first two albums were great.
1,awful,Notice how there has only been one single released for this album...because there is only one worth releasing. The songs on this album are so boring that i could not wait to stop playing it (it was that painful). Listen to all songs before you buy.
2,A disappointment,"I was such a BIG fan of Seal's last album, that I couldn't imagine anything less than a great album from Seal. But that's what I got... something less than great. A LOT less than great. This album bored me to tears. And it was depressing. I really tried to like it. Really, I did. I owed him that much, didn't I? But alas, I can't. It's a disappointing dud. There's not a single hummable melody. Completely forgettable."
4,Great CD by others standards,"This CD lacked the inspirational qualities that the first two releases had in abundance. Personally I think Seal is at his best with efforts like ""Future Love Paradise"" and ""I'm Alive"". I could not point to one song on Human Beings which captures that spirit.This is not to say that it is all bad. For the Seal fan it is full of sumptuous tunes(i.e. Lost My Faith and When A Man Is Wrong). Truly there are redeeming qualities which make this worth purchasing but it is not as great as the first two Seal releases.It is my hope that Seal sensed that Human Beings did not inspire which accounted for its poor sales. He is giving hints that he has returned to the muses of the past with his release of ""This Could Be Heaven"". I can't wait to hear what else he has in store for us."
3,Excellent singing and great wall of sound but ...,"Seal's Human Being abstracts the artist's emotions resulting from lost love and other issues into the music. The result is a vocal concerto with Seal as the soloist. Of course, Seal's vocal crescendos supported by the lavish accompaniment lead to a work which is captivating and hypnotic. The downside to this approach is that most of the lyrics are incoherent and meaningless. Seal would have been just as effective, in most of the songs, if he would have sung the notes of the scale (Fa, Re, Do)."
2,a disappointing comeback,"After a brilliant first album and an interesting but less exciting second opus, I was quite curious to see how Seal would pass the third album barrier. On the good side, there are two songs touched by grace (""human being"" and ""colour""), wich can be listened to for hours, with beautiful melodies, rich production and nice lyrics. On the bad side, the rest of the CD is a bit soporific. Nice ideas, gorgeous production but the magic is missing. Had he done at least five songs of the level of ""human being""... but two are not enough. Still a good CD to relax..."
2,Disappointing effort for a great artist,"I was hooked with his first release, and after his second release I was blown away by the lush multi-layered textures woven into a musical masterpiece. Sad to say, after listening to the third release several times I was left feeling as if something was missing or incomplete. There are several moments on the CD where I found hints of Seal's genius prying through this scape of fairly unmemorable tracks. Alas, none were enough to lift this latest effort out of mediocrity."
4,"Thickish , veiled production , Seals voice saves the album","The is a certain lack of clarity and sparkle to the recording,a thickness that seems to veil everything, the bass energy is wooly, the melodies sometimes lose their way in the production,and keyboards dominate.There is even a comment in the liner notes by Seal in effect complaining about the guitars going missing!.But the lush soundscapes have the desired effect with extended listening, lulling the listener into a mellow trancelike state if allowed! By the way, Trevor Horn is capable of ultra clarity, remember Yes' minor classic 90125 from 1983?. Seals' heartfelt lyrics and voice are always worth getting mellow for."
2,A Disappointment,"Maybe I was looking forward to Seal's new album just a little too much. His first two albums are indeed classics. With Trevor Horn again as producer, and help from Wendy and Lisa and William Orbit (who helped out Madonna with Ray of Light), I expected a third classic. I even was excited after hearing the first single. I thought, this is going to be good. I'm sorry to say I was wrong. Like I said, I enjoyed the first single and track (Human Being), but as each track wore on, I grew nervous. Where was the magic? As the cd ended, I realized there was no magic - only boredom. Maybe next time."
5,An artist that strives for perfection continues to deliver!!,"How rewarding it can be when a musical artist refuses to compromise the creative process; particularly when he has something fabulous to deliver. What is perfection? Just listen to Seal's third album, ""Human Being"", over and over again. He's like a gatekeeper, opening portals to very personal experiences that every listener will relate to. Both production and performances are so rich and innovative that you hear something new with every listening. From beginning to end, this album is in a class of its own. It will entertain fans, both new and old, and cause them to scan the media for an opportunity to see Seal's live performances scheduled for the new year. BRING IT ON"
2,"Good background music, but not like his first two cd's","I bought Human Being after having loved Seal's first two cd's. The opening track is excellent, but then it goes down hill from there. Many of the songs sound the same, and by the time it's over I actually feel a bit depressed by the music. There are no hits on here, in fact after listening to it many times, I can't remember any of the tunes.....LISTEN BEFORE YOU BUY!!"
4,Simply enchanting,"I gotta admit I wasn't expecting anything at first when I purchased it. However, after listening to its title track ""Human Being"", I was simply awestruck! That man can sing!! I personally like ""Just like you said"" &""Colours"" though the other tracks were just as good if not better. The album get my highest recommendation to anyone looking for music that soothes & inspires."
2,Seal's Weakest Recording.,"What happened here? This album is very weak compared to the first two, ""5 star"" efforts. Listening to this album you get hints of the something good but its lost behind the so VERY weak production!These songs ARE good. But the recording sucks! As a practicing musician my self who has done many studio recordings, the best way i can describe my impression of this album is it sounds like a compilation of late night, 4-track, amateur demo recordings.Wheres the beef!? No strong guitar, no strong keys, and the rhythm section sounds like a dime store casio beat machine. Seals vocals are good, but he cant make up for the weak production and the ""Mr Microphone"" cheapyness.I Highly reccomend Seal's 1st album. It rocks and is by far the his best yet. The second album is great too....."
3,A distant third best Seal album,"""Human Being"" pales as a whole, when compared to Seal's first two albums. The album starts off with two left feet, it seems, and doesn't seem to get things going in classic Seal style until ""Excerpt From"" and the tracks that follow it.By the time you reach ""No Easy Way"" (the absolute gem on this album) you wonder if there would be any reason to listen to the first few tracks again. In the end, it lands a comfortable third spot in Seal's discography, not only chronologically but in terms of quality too."
1,too much formula,"this guy has talent and can sing.but this formula record is tired and boring to the ""t"".nothing new and exciting.hopefully his next record won't take near as long and will be better."
3,"An ""okay"" release.","Unfortunately Human Beings lacks that certain magic that makes CD's like this grab you. Unlike his other two CD's, the lyrics are emotional and there is a lot of substance to wade thru. This is a good thing, unfortunately, its also largely devoid musically or lyrically of anything to hold your interest or catch your imagination. The more you listen to the CD, the more you begin to admire Seal's artistry and the layered quality of the songs. Unfortunately, its a case of the parts being more than the sum."
5,"Have you REALLY LISTENED to the chords and harmony on this ""HUMAN BEINGS"" C.D.?","Seal is so underrated!! He is one of the few ""Human Beings"" that can colloborate with himself and his musicians to acheive a sound that is ""ASTOUNDING""!! My favorites are ""Human Being"", ""Colours"", ""Princess"", and ""Lost My Faith"". Thanks SEAL for sharing your SPIRIT of phenomenal enlightenment!!"
4,Cool & captivating,"Someone else called it ""A sadly overlooked gem"" and I couldn't agree more. An album which some might call more of a Trevor Horn album with his trademark sweeping orchestral sound mixed with electronic beats he made famous with other acts like Yes and Frankie Goes To Hollywood. But here, Seal balances Trevor's production with the album's mix of power-waltz ballads (Just Like You Said), cool techno (Except From, which sounds like an excerpt from something), and soul-searching epics (Lost My Faith). I listened to this more than the other two albums combined. That's saying something..."
2,Dented and not tasty,"The cans were dented and the strawberries were strange. This is my first time eating non-fresh strawberries at home. They are the grey pink color of the strawberries in the basket that have turned bad in patches. The taste is not a rotted taste. It tastes different. Not toxic tasting but new and unencouraging. I placed three strawberries on each waffle and my family ignored them. Unlike the other berries, this not pleasant to eat straight so I will use them mashed in chiffon cake. I am not optimistic.I made a chiffon cake with a can of strawberries and used the red liquid in the frosting. The result: flavorless."
5,"Recommend to anyone, not only photographers and journalists","This book is great, it contains such an amount of interesting material, includes photos of Capa and others photographers, and costs almost nothing. This is not just about Magnum Photo - it's about XX century. There also many reference for whom got interesting for further studing photography. This book - must have"
4,Good reading - this is history for photographers,"Well written, good reading. this is paper-back novels for photographers. :-)Full of funny quotes along the line of ""at any time there are about 50 photographers wanting to leave Magnum, that is the entire agency"". This book documents the drama and creative energy of having a agency run by creative individuals.As a official worshiper of Magnum, I can say, this is required reading.If you don't know what Magnum is, and could not care less, then honestly this book is going to be a complete waste of money... BUT if you are trying to understand how 50 creative photographers have managed to work together for this long, then this is one of the books you want to read."
4,It does work.,My wife suffers as many women do and this product is helpful in minimizing the discomfort and seems to diminish the progress of the problem.
2,A tale of disaster.,"I am now almost certainly headed for my third of these printers under warranty. The first had the green flashng light of death, revived temporarily after firmware upgrade then died again. The next (warranty replacement), proceded to go the opposite way to Henry Ford and print any colour other than black! When the first printer did work (lasted about 60 pages) it was fast, the auto duplexing was efficient and the photo quality perfectly acceptable for A4 prints on decent paper. I am now waiting for a replacement printhead and if this does not solve the problem ...bring on printer number three!Incidentally as a stopgap I have purchased a DJ6980 which although smaller with a combined (read expensive to run) colour cartridge, prints faultlessly with auto duplexing and has USB, ethernet and WiFi connectivity.If I get the K550DTN working reliably I'll try to post again."
2,REVLON EYELINER,"THE EYELINER ITSELF IS FINE, BUT THE DESCRIPTION AS ""TAUPE"" IS MISLEADING. THE COLOR REALLY IS ""COCOA"" AND NOT TAUPE. AFTER RECEIVING IT, I REALIZED IT IS TOO DARK. APPARENTLY REVLON HAS DISCONTINUED THE ""TAUPE"" COLOR, BECAUSE IT IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. BUT THE EYELINER I RECEIVED IS ""COCOA"" COLORED, TOO DARK, AND MISLABLED ON YOUR SITE"
5,"Excellent color, excellent staying power",I have been using this liner for years. The color is a nice compromise between a deep brown and a berry--you'd never notice it wasn't brown unless you looked closely but it really complements brown eyes. And it lasts all day!
4,Nice little tea pot,This was a very nice unique little tea pot and was well received when given as a gift.
3,Write your own...............,"It is ok, but a bit willy nilly, would not recommend as a beginners text in conspiracy theory as it it is too jumbled and poorly written to build a good base on, but it has its moments of lurid tabloid derri-do.Check out Feral House, New Falcon, Amok, Disinfo...for better stuff than this.... Peter Levenda, William Cooper, David Icke, Alex Jones, Christopher Hyatt, Jordan Maxwell, Aleister Crowley, or Jim Keith will all answer your questions."
1,Junk,Not sure who wrote the reviews on this dvd & cd collection but this stuff is junk. Cd sounds like crap in my cd player in my cars and the dvd is junk in my dvd player with bose surround sound. Ended up going back to download studio mp3's of the few tracks I enjoy. DON'T WASTE YOU'RE MONEY ON THIS SET. High end equipment will not make up for the poor job they did on this set.
1,Toto - Live in Amsterdam (DVD),"Just like with the Doobie Brothers ""Live at Wolf Trap"" DVD this one doesn't work with any of the DVD players I have at home nor with those at my friend's homes. I ordered these DVD's from Germany and - since this was clearly indicated - expect them to be playable on my equipment here. As with the Doobie Brothers I will send this back and ask for a refund."
3,fair price for a small e-commerce.,"what can you expect from this price? it is pretty good for someone just planning to start up a small e-commerce. most of the e-commerce program does not come with shopping cart, so i think it is great buy. you can find add-on shopping cart, but it is expensive."
1,Action packed Clay animation Dinosaurs of the Jurassic,"The word ""action"" should have been left off of the title of this video. Packed is more like it. Packed with slow moving 1st grade gumby style dinosaurs that are very, very slow. That's probably because the video was ment to be a documentary and not a children's video. But even the word packed is relative. The 1st story is the only clay animation you'll find on this video. The balance of the tape is filled with still photo, classroom style learning stories. If you're fascinated by this type of animation then this tape is for you."
1,Much much less than 45 minutes of clay animation,"The video has about 10-15 minutes of some really original, even ""heartwarming"" animation of prehistoric animals, from Triceratops to tiny mammals. The problem is that after the first 15 minutes it lurches into a science lecture on dinosaurs with all of the sophistication, charm, and still cartoon artwork of a cheezy 6th grade filmstrip from the 1970's.I was disappointed, because Amazon represented this as ""45 minutes of clay animation."""
1,why so expensive???,"I was just curious if Amazon had this product, and looked it up. I was shocked to see it listed by the seller for 17 dollars!! You can purchase this item at Kiehl's and other places like Nordstroms and Neiman Marcus for $6.50 for the 0.6 oz or $8.50 for a 1 oz jar! I have used this product, it's great and I recommend it, but DON'T buy it here. It's more expensive than your average Chapstick, but 17 dollars is ridiculous!!"
3,Literally,"One of the only Cat Power discs that I can stomach, with fuller-fleshed out arrangements finely complimenting her questionable songwriting skills and growing vocal strengths."
3,"Ok, but not the greatest","Other reviews led me to believe this was one of those CDs with all tracks being awesome. Unfortunately, not the case, 2 - 4 tracks were great, the others were boring."
3,overall worth it,"It's not her best career work, but similar to her live performances there are some magic moments that make the CD worth it. She puts out such heartfelt work it's hard not to support it."
3,Earnest effort but there's no magic here,"Sometimes meetings of disparate minds work well in music. Usually, the result, however, is tentative and plodding. And that's what we have here. Merging indy slacker persona Cat Power with a Memphis sound is curious, but ultimately unsatisfying.Cat Power's strengths are in creating mood with her smokey voice and lyrics of longing. Memphis music is about groove, melody and unbridled emotion. Ulitmately, the mix leaves the band underutlilized and you can sense the frustration in the musicians trying to get a handle on music that makes them play against their strengths.This album is a failed experiment, but it was worth a try. These songs would have benefited from more standard indy arrangements. In this setting, what stands out is that rhythmically and melodically there's not a whole lot going on here."
3,The Greatest - it grows on you,"I love Chan, I love her music. I was so excited to buy this CD. The first time I heard it I was so dissapointed, I didn't think it was her best work, although the song 'the greatest' is awesome. However, after listening to it every day it has grown on me. If you are a true fan you will love everything she does, I know I do...but I must admit this album has taken a while to grow on me."
3,Ouch. Let me pull Myra Lee back out.,"I have been following the highs and lows of Cat Power for the past 10 years, and this is really the lesser of the albums to date. I have absolutely adored the music that has come out of this enterprise, but not this collection.Standout songs on the CD are: The Greatest, Willie, Hate, and Love & Communication.The other songs are a yawn one to the next. The title track was really wonderful, and I had high hopes. I gave it a fair shot, and after a couple of listens, I pulled Myra Lee back out.If you are trying to get your hands on the Bonus Track, it's the weakest song on the CD, so it's more like an unfortunate addendum."
3,Better idea than execution,"Chan Marshall had a great idea in getting these classic Memphis soul musicians to back her on this album, and their playing is excellent. The mood to the album in nice, as well. The only problem is that, with a few exceptions, the songs are somewhat weak. They just kind of lie there. Still it's an album I would somewhat recommend. But if you want Cat Power's best, go straight to Moon Pix."
2,meh,"I suppose I don't really ""get"" Cat Power, which is surprising most of all to me, having been a huge fan of Velocity Girl, Eve's Plum, Liz Phair, and many other alt-prog chick rockers. With Cat Power, though, I just feel like Ms. Marshall has a beautiful voice with nowhere to go. The lyrics in these songs are shallow and wanderlust, the music droning and dull, and the entire album is utterly and completely forgetable.I won't deny that Cat Power has a large and rabid following (indeed, I thoroughly expect this review to be flamed by said legion), however I just think there are better indie-rock choices on the market for my $14, and I really can't recommend this one."
5,"""Living Proof"" that Cat Power is perhaps the best indie artist out there.","This album is more quiet than her previous outings, but it still carries the same Cat Power vibe that you always get from her. The best tracks here include The Greatest, Could We, Lived In Bars, Living Proof, and Love & Communication.The best album of 06 so far."
4,beautiful but overkill at times,"I saw her play these songs solo with an acoustic guitar and a piano about 2 months before this was released. That might have been the most beautiful show i've ever seen. Top 5 definitely.When i got this album the day it was released it took me a while to find the songs i remembered from the show. I knew they were there but i didn't recognize them. the backing band just took over in too many of the songs. sometimes it works, like in ""Lived In Bars"" and ""The Greatest"" but ""Empty Shell"" loses most of it's charm. Stand out tracks such as ""Hate"" and ""The Moon"" are beautiful because of their simplicity.A major accomplishment for Cat Power. I just Hope I can see her play these solo again."
2,Hyped and boring,"I bought this on the basis of a magazine review.I am thoroughly underwhelmed.Not even seasoned Memphis pros could rescue this dreary, twee and indulgent project.Miss Chan, go back to your lo fi/alterna crap."
2,Chan can do better than this.,"Incorporating more instruments is a good move even though I loved the sparse textures of the excellent You Are Free. The problem here is that she's singing her smoky voice through the kind of junk that Van Morrison sh_ts out these days (someone needs to tell him to stop coasting on his reputation and record some good MUSIC to go along with for a change, but I digress). The music on this collection does not do her justice - it is definitely NOT the cat's meow. It is lame, actually. There is one good song, ""The Moon"". Unfortunately, the album reverts back to whatever theme she was trying to evoke. I dreamt Hope Sandoval would step in and show her how it's done. Once again, the rock press gets it wrong. This is not a very good album. Here's hoping she tries using a band again to improved effect."
5,"Great CD, Sellout ""Artist""","I loved this CD. It moved me, amazed me, and made me want to grind all over my sig other (now fiance). I think this CD might be one of the reasons that we are getting married.That said, I was heartbroken when I heard her cover of ""How Can I Tell You"" by Cat Stevens used in a diamond commercial. Now, I can never listen to another CD by Cat Power without wondering if she wrote that song because she *had* to, or because she wanted to sell X?<sigh> This is why I hate it when singers allow their songs or performances to be used in commercials. It puts the stench of impure motives on everything they do from that moment forward. As Bill Hicks said ""You do a commercial, you're off the artistic roll call forever. End of story."""
1,"Cat has labored, brought forth a hairball","This was highly recommended. Lord knows why. It's instantly forgettable, flat and tuneless. If people think this is good, then the state of music is bad these days, the dearth of talent severe. Caveat emptor."
2,Sick of waiting,"She came out all hyped up (I bought the first CD on the strength of a glowing ""Big Takeover"" review), and I just didn't see it. The songs just went nowhere, hookless and drifting, and her voice seems purposely breathless. So here we are, several years later, and nothing has changed. A little funk injection in places does not help. I'm through waiting for her to get it, whatever it would be for her."
2,surprisingly boring,"i love cat power. love everything she touches. but this sounds really boring and the backing band, albeit ""legendary"" sounds like a really boring studio for hire---not much emotion in these bluesy tracks. title track is brilliant though."
3,Recommended for Loveless fans,"I wish I could say that I found that the story played out like the product description, however I was left wondering if I was watching the same thing.I am a huge fan of Loveless, however I have not had the pleasure to read the Manga. I am reliant upon the DVDs. There are usually 4 episodes on each disc, however each episode is very short--not long enough for me anyway. The last episode on the vol. 3 disc left me going, ""NO WAY!"" and a little bit of ""Huh?"" The product description is referring the the final episode on the disc and there are a few ""filler"" episodes up till then, one being particularly cute.If you haven't watched Loveless, this volume isn't the place to start. In volume 3 there is a little more angst and love-driven confusion than the other volumes, but that would be expected as the relationships are growing. I'd recommend this for the Loveless fan."
4,Not bad for a kit,"I made 36 tamales today (3 kits of 12), the first time ever to make tamales. Not bad, though I wish there were more specific tips (more than provided on the label) on how to form each of the tamales and additional filling recipes. I found that my tamales were a bit on the mushy side after an hour's steaming and wasn't sure if that was to be expected. It all worked out in the end though. Let your tamales cool down and they'll firm up just fine."
4,label,I bought this for office use and honestly I have not used it. But the price was great. Thanks.
5,lost mines,"I would curl up and die without my laminator. I love it, unfortunately, Brother no longer manufactures this item. The supplies are hard to find. I was thrilled to purchase a lifetime supply of cartridges. I was able to also find a back up unit on Amazon. With any luck I can laminate on my death bed."
4,Good find,"We could not find these in the stores any more for our older laminating machine.I was happy that there are still some being sold.Works well, shipped quickly."
5,Best Book on GI Bill,"This is without question one of the best books on the history of the GI Bill and its impact on America. I found it to be well researched and an enjoyable read. Clearly, the secret to the success of the GI Bill is that it was an earned benefit that changed the social dynamics of America by creating ""middle-class"" America, creating ""suburbia"", putting veterans' back into the workforce, and opening the doors of colleges to a population of citizens that would have never received a college education. One of the greatest pieces of social legislation ever enacted. Leaves readers with one unanswered question: ""Why aren't today's veterans worthy of the same benefits?"""
4,John Mayall 70th Birthday,"Some great blues standards, nice to see EC and Mayall reunited 40+ years later! If you like Mayall, you're going to like this."
4,John Mayall & The Bluebreakers & Friend DVD,"Excellant show but didnt have the full concert on it, but whats there is excellant"
3,A so-so outing for the king of the blues,"I bought this DVD because I figured a 70th birthday would bring out the best in Mayall's Breakers. Not so. A lackadaisical outing for them, and nothing of what I remember from the early 70's. Do not know if their lackluster performance was an anomaly or if the group has been going downhill since then. Will not buy another Mayall DVD and instead will enjoy my memories of one of my favorite blues men of the past."
5,a real sleeper,"This dvd turned out to be one of my favorites in my collection,and I have many.John Mayall is truly a blues legend and a man of many talents.If your a blues fan, you will enjoy this one.Great sound,good camera work and great selection of songs.This is a keeper."
3,A rehash of other Nanking films,"If you haven't seen any of the other Rape of Nanking films, this is worth watching. I recommend THE FLOWERS OF WAR and its documentary of the filming."
4,A dramatic tale for a war story rarely told.,"It is true that most war movies are concentrated in the two World Wars in Europe, with an extension for the Pacific conflicts. And this may be the reason why the drama depicted in this movie seems rather new. The film maker is a young Chinese man, very competent, technically skilled, but there is something missing that is hard to describe. It is perhaps the lack of insight on why the Japanese invaded China and massacred civilians during that period, I really don't know. Overall, the narrative tone is very depressive, and left me not longing to see it again anytime soon."
3,Nicely filmed but doesn't rise above simply depicting a series of horrible events,"Begins asSaving Private Ryan, evolves intoSchindler's List. Well made, nicely filmed in black and white but doesn't have a strong enough through line to rise above simply depicting a series of horrible events."
2,It is far from a historical fact.,"This is a propaganda movie having low degree that created a random historical fact by the Chinese Communist Party. The Japanese soldier puts it in Nanjing and does not adopt the act described for this movie at all. The direction of the Japanese military is extremely unpolished. However, I think even monochrome picture description to be high in the artistry."
5,This is a STAR among the 360 launch titles...,"Call of Duty 2 is one of the best games at the launch of the xbox 360. The graphics are incredible, the gameplay is immersive and it leaves little to be desired.If you have a 360... or are going to get one... get this game with it."
2,simple and fun but a bit boring,"If 2 1/2 stars was an option that would be my rating. I'm a World War 2 buff so I enjoyed the realism and historical basis of this game but overall it's just a basic, decent game to get your shooter fix. It's an older game yet I was still impressed with the graphics and gameplay. My main complaint is that it gets boring. It lacks variety and it didn't grab my interest enough to make me want to play it for very long stretches of time. I was rarely itching to play it the way I've been with other shooters. Of course part of the problem is that I'm used to playing such greats as Bioshock, Halo 3, Gears of War, and COD4. Call of Duty 2 certainly isn't as good as COD4 but I only paid $10 for a brand new copy of this game and at that price or less it's probably worth the money."
2,"The gameplay is ok, but the tank controls suck. This game is mediocre overall.","Considering its a COD game, its main focus is the war aspect of it and what is going on throughout the game as this aspect covers it. Anyway the online multiplayer is okay and is pretty much the main reason why anyone plays a COD game, the on-foot FPS controls are okay and u can't sprint in this game which is stupid. What is also stupid is the fact that the controls for the tank that u control is horrible. Also there really isn't much to this game as well as the fact that the fact that the infinite ammo cheat doesn't work at all. Anyway this game is boring in my opinion and doesn't really interest me. 5/10"
4,Call of Duty 2,"I got an XBOX 360 for Christmas and wanted this game above all others. I enjoy WWII first person shooters and from what I read, this was the cream of the crop. I really enjoyed this game; the landscapes were lush, the action was fun and there was a good variety in terms of game play--you start off as a Russian soldier in Stalingrad and once you finish those missions you unlock the British Campaign in North Africa and then finish the game as an American in France during and after D-Day. I just wish this game were longer, perhaps incorporating a Japanese section. From what I know, there are only a handful of Pacific-Theater based WWII games, but none of them really did well. Also, from a few people that own Call of Duty 3 as well, many agreed that Call of Duty 2 is better rounded and more fun."
4,Best wwII shooter for the 360.,"Though the jaded gamer may pass over any game with the words wwII fps in it this is one you shouldn't miss out on. This game comes with an excellent, yet short, single player campaign and good multiplayer as well.The single player is the true standout with some of the most intense roller coaster levels you will ever play in any shooter. The graphics are now dated although the smoke effects are nice, the rest is very last gen.Don't let that stop you from buying this game which is totally worth a buy for anyone who owns a 360.****"
3,"Decent Single player, online needs improvements","Now comming from the PC version of the original CoD, I was hoping for great improvements in this game, and I was suprised how great the graphics were, but I found the online play to be a little less to be desired (I guess it's the pc gamer in me, was expecting a little more out of th 360). The biggest plus, is the graphics. Other soldiers and smoke look unbelievable. The one annoying thing I found about both the single and multiplayer is the inability to peer around corners like you could in the original. For online play, 8 players tops for xbox live, and you don't even get to choose a 'server' (as in the PC version) and cycle through maps. Everytime a game ends, you have to rejoin a new game. To top it all off, the offline multiplayer doesn't include bots, so if you only have two players, you're only playing against each other. Hopefully activision will take this into consideration upon their next release of an xbox game."
5,GREAT GAME,I played this game for a very short time at eb games on a demo but it was an amazing game. I loved the grahpics they blew my mind with every little detail loong amazing and the game play was the best of any war game iv ever played it was a very realistic but fun game that i cant wait 2 play when i get the 360 tuesday.
3,OK but not great.,"This game starts out good. But by the time you get Tunisia the game starts to suck. The tank battles suck and then you have an idiot driving the armored get away vehicle in Tunisia. At this point, I am sick of it. I know the game is old, but it is like the creators just gave up on the game to get it into production. This is when I put it on the shelf. You get stuck in a situation that your skill does not count for much. I have been stuck in situations before in FPS games but then you figure it out with a change in tactic. With this, there is no chance to change strategy. It ain't no HALO, but what do you want for $7. It is worth $7, barely. It was fun for about a week and better than Modern Warfare."
1,Zzzzzz,"All that I really need to say is, while me and two other friends were playing this game on multiplayer, I was beginning to fall asleep. One of my other friends actually DID fall asleep!I found this game to be utterly slow and relatively safe in terms of what it can do--this is not a good thing. There is nothing innovate to speak of. How many times can they redo WWII video games? There's no story line, unless you enjoy sham remakes of what really happened. There really isn't much historical fact here either.But I guess most people that play this junk are too fat and lazy to open an actual text book to learn what really happened."
2,Blah,This game does not look like he game they show on the commericals. The graphics are pretty but is that all the 360 can do?? The gameplay is the same as previous versions. zzzzzzzzzzzzDisappointed in the system overall. I don't think a casual gamer would buy a 360.
1,load of crap,I found it difficult to move and very boring. No on screen help......I could have been stuck walking around for hours had I not ejected it from the Xbox then gave it away at work. Don't waste your time or money on this.
5,Graphics are stellar,"I buy all of the 360 games as soon as they come out - at least I have so far. Of all the games, the sound and visual quality of this game us just flat out impressive. The story line and flow is very pre-determined so there is not much mystery to the adventure. The thrill comes from what your sensory system will absorb. If you are not using high-def TV and a good surround sound system, you will probably still enjoy it but if you want to be blown away, go all out and get the hook up. I am hopeful there will be a number of 360 games coming up with similar quality."
3,Not for Xbox Live,"Great single player game, but plaing on xbox live will only give you heartburn. You can not setup your own games. You can not set your own map. You can not pick who you play with (teams or clans). Who ever is first on the list of an online game is the server, even if they are a slow connection, so you can expect some major lag time, jumpy graphics, and even disconnects."
4,An awsome game. Worth the money (scavenger hunt),"This is a must buy for the xbox 360 console. It is a fun as it is amazing! I would definitly recomment buying it to anyone who carries a 360 in their possesion. Although the online is a bit laggy and has a very small server, it is still fun and worth the wait to get a game going (most of the time :) Congratulations on making it this far into my scavenger hunt! Next you will have to message me with this code so I know you made it this far. The code is ""CODIN09"" The graphics I wouldn't say are xbox 360 material, but they are still fairly dencent. I have this game and it is my favorite 360 game up to date. Also, one of the most played games on xbox live at the moment."
3,Great Console Play with Lackluster Online Play,"This game is great in single player mode at normal difficulty. As you can read in the other reviews the graphics are incredible and the AI is great for both your allies and enemies alike until you play on veteran mode. In veteran difficulty your squadmates suddenly become stupid and help very little, making the game harder but unrealistic. Also, your enemies suddenly know where you are at all times and only target you even if your whole squad is standing out in the open. If that isn't enough, the online play and multiplayer play is horrible. There are no co-op missions for multiplayer console play, and the online scenarios are weakly put together. If not for those two issues, this game could have been what Halo was to the original Xbox. Instead, it will be known as a good World War Two shooter with awesome graphics. The 360 is still waiting for a game worthy of its power."
5,Call of Duty 2,"Excellent 1st shooter game, graphics are awesome, & you learn a little bit of history behind one of the most devasting wars in world history. It makes you realize, war is made to be played on a game console, not in real life...our world leaders have yet to understand this..."
5,Greatest Game Ever,"I have played a lot of games, specifically, a lot of war games, and fps games are my favorite type of game. This game is my favorite game. The single player mission is amazing, especially on veteran, which I recommend playing first, because if you play on regular or hardened first, it will be hard to become accustumed to veteran. The online multiplayer is the greatest online experience I have ever had. Some complain that the maps only hold 8 people, but that makes it all the more fun in my opinion. This is also the game I'm best at, I play other games, but in this one, I rarely don't get first place on the Live game. And even when CoD3 comes out, I assure you, that I will still be playing this game because it was made by Infinity Ward, which we all know has made the best Call of Duty games. If you like War games, FPS games, any games at all, get this game, you will not regret it, though you should buy the GotY edition, because it comes with the extra map packs."
3,Fails to impress,"I was expecting a lot from this game as an owner of Ghost Recon 2. The third edition failed to impress, yea graphics got better and loading times are blazing fast, but the game itself just isn't as fun as the previous. It is actually alot easier to master than the previous, a little more game like than real world. It's good, just not great. Wait a couple of months and I'd expect it to get pretty cheap, not something I intend to keep in my premenant game collection.Online play is just as expected. Not much say here, it's fails to impress in this regard as well. Ghost Recon 2 is definatly superior and more challenging."
3,Single Player is Great -- Multiplayer big disappointment,Probably worth buying just for the single player games.Multiplayer is a huge disappointment. You can't select a group of players (friends) and start a game with just that group. One person has to get into a game and everyone else has to go into their dashboard and join the game in session before Xbox Live finds 7 other people on its own. This is a MAJOR DRAWBACK.
2,Call of Duty 1.1,This is not call of duty 2 but more like call of duty 1.1 or call of duty 1 plus. They say the xbox360 is capable of so more but this game does not look like that good when i saw it on tv I was I am definitely going to get that game so I was so let down it look like the xbox version not the 360 version if you have a 360 do not get this game but if you have a xbox 1 then buy the xbox version .The game is not bad but the 360 version just does not look all that good..
5,5+ Star Game,"This is the best war game I have played so far. COD:The Big Red One was excellent, but this one was better. This game had the best atmosphere I have seen in a war game. The dialogue between your squad mates were really well done & it added to the intensity of the shoot outs. The musical symphony was outstanding! I really like the control layout for this game on the Xbox 360 controller. There were a large amount of weapons to choose from as well. The emotion that your commanding officer gives you to complete an order made me feel like I was in the service again! If this game was this good, I can't wait to play COD 3 & 4!"
2,Short Life,I bought this battery one year ago and now it won't hold a charge. The original Toshiba battery lasted 4 years.
2,"Godard as poseur, the Stones as artists","At the time this film was made, Godard's reputation was as a great avant-garde artist while the Stones were mere pop singers. Thirty-odd years on, the roles are reversed. It can be seen that the Stones created something lasting while Godard's contributions to this movie are cinematically amateurish and politically primitive. Unfortunately Godard wasn't enough of an artist to appreciate the material he had, and so he keeps cutting away from the Stones to add various undergraduate-level film tricks. The net result is increased appreciation for the professionalism and discipline of the boys -- well, of Jagger, Richards, Wyman and Watts (Brian Jones is a silent, stoned presence playing inaudible rhythm guitar) -- because it contrasts so strongly with the lack of professionalism and discipline in the film itself."
1,***pathetic (NO sympathy!),"Great song; ridiculous movie.I'm of this silly generation, yet it is not the silliness of half this movie which bothers me. (The movie mixes footage of the Rolling Stones recording ""Sympathy For the Devil"" with immature, amateur social ""commentary"".)It is the arrogance and the ignorance which flows from this film that bothers me, the fakery that richness and idleness birth. Silly me! When I was impressionable, I listened to these jesters and these jumping jack flashes rather than the wisdom of the west.Maybe this is why so many had so many objections to us in the 1970s; we were so objectionable.Continue to listen to the song. Save yourself, though, from this dull, pornographic drivel. (Unless, of course, you want to see just how ugly and empty we were then.)"
3,"Stones Great, Goddard Blows","Having grown up in the 60s, I have to say I saw some asinine, pretentious crap mixed in with the earnest good intentions. The studio footage in this DVD is great, the Goddard contributions and cuts are just plain aggravating. And embarassing. That part is so bad, it makes me cringe for my generation, and I thought about returning the DVD. But it's worth keeping for the Stones in the studio. I guess this is (more) proof that art and politics rarely mix well. DC"
2,Scattered and Rambling; Of little interest to musicians,"This film is unfocused and of little interest to musicians who hope to get an inside look at the Stones' process of developing songs in the studio. I was looking for something along the lines of Let It Be, but this is all about one song only, and large sections are buried under seemingly random rambling by a male voice affecting a literary quality.Then there are the completely unrelated sections taking place out on the street and in a junkyard and elsewhere.If you're looking for absurdity mixed with psychedelia and 60s music, I'd recommend the Monkees' Head which is much more fun and also very interesting and thought-provoking."
4,Interesting...,"Well, it was a an...interesting...film...not a straight-ahead documentary, but did have some added surrealistic clips put in. Not for the casual Stones fan."
2,Dont bother...not even in the same league as Exile,I bought this hoping to see what kinda rig Keef used for the solo....never really shown.what was shown was 1 hr of social commentary crap that was not interesting and only mildly artistic.would have much rather seen more of the exhausting studio sessions.
2,a boring waste of money,I found this a boring waste of money. It could have been condensed down to 10 minutes.
1,Big Disappointment!,"I am a huge fan of the late 60s and early 70s era Stones. I bought this DVD without knowing anything about the French director Jean-Luc Godard. The so called ""pop politiacal cartoons"" that the review on the back cover refers to as sheer genius, are moronic and actually painful to watch. These skits are all about socialism, black power, and revolution. Oh boy! The high minded symbolism of this movie just looks ridiculous to me. The skits in this movie are so un-professional that they appear to be made by Junior High School kids! And that is a slight to the kids! As far as the Stones rehersals, they are interesting, but slow. They develop only the one song. As great as that song is (one of my all time favorite Stones tunes) it's just not something to watch over and over again. Especially if you have to endure the rest of this horrible movie."
2,Sympathy for the Devil,"I remembered seeing this in a theatre coupled with Gimme Shelter. But I had forgotten how bad and bizarre it was. Thank Goodness I bought it used for a few dollars more than nothing. I think it may be impossible to sit through the whole feature without the finger on the fast forward button during the bookstore, Democracy Eve interview and black militant scenes."
1,a stone fan,"just got this, the stones are great, the rest sucks....I can't even make to the end, my wife just laughs at me every time I put it in to try to see the end. sorry it sucks........"
2,Be Prepared To Use The Remote,"I'm a really big Stones fan. Im actually wearing a Stones shirt as I write this. I've glanced at this on and on, until a few nights ago I was given a Gift Card and decided to buy it.Well I started watching it and the whole process of developing this great classic song was awesome. But the Director's crap with the incoherent babbling of some man, weird scenes with a bunch of Black Panthers was completely pointless in my opinion. I had to skip these segments quite a bit to get to the hidden jems in this movie.Again, I loved seeing the band develope the song, it was phenomenal to get that Insider's perspective, but the rest was crap. I was expecting something similar to The Who's Kids Are Alright, where they show scenes of them in the recording studio, with unadulterated footage, but Sympathy was something much different. This is worth renting to see the band, but I wouldn't suggest owning it."
2,So so,"This movie is only good when the Stones are on (I love the song ""Sympathy For the Devil""). The rest I fast-forwarded through. Godard originally asked the Beatles to be the band that appeared in this movie. The Beatles turned Godard down. The Beatles were very very smart."
3,wow,"Got this movie because it had the stones in it, kinda confused about all the other stuff, still its pretty interesting even though it dont really make much sense."
1,Save your money & time,"My rating is a big fat zreo. The Stones fiddle around with the song off and on but never really get it going. Brian Jones is allbut invisable. The social commentary that is interspersed throughout was probably cool at some point in time but I've seen it all come and go. My remote was working, and I used it a lot.I'm still looking for something really good by the Stones on DVD, VHS whatever and have yet to find it. I saw them in 1971 and they were decent but didn't really leave that much of an impression as a live band."
1,It made me shiver...,"This is the epitome of romances, it had me ""thrilled"" up until the last page, when he ""made love to her"" her, violently.I found this novel obcene and feel that it should be banned for its inappropriate and outrageous portrayal of the female gender."
4,a great LA mystery,"There's always a lot of talk of following in Marlowe's footsteps, but this is the closest anyone's ever gotten. However, this is not a Chandler imitation, Harris stakes out his own vision of LA and humanity in general.I hear, after how many years, he's finally gotten down to writing a third Kyd novel. Can't wait!"
5,Outstanding!,"This is one of the best books in the hardboiled mystery field since Raymond Chandler's THE LONG GOODBYE, which it's very reminiscent of but which it's NOT an imitation of. It's too bad Harris hasn't written more than three books about Thomas Kyd. He'd rank right up there with Spade, Marlowe, Archer, and (for my money) Stephen Greenleaf's John Marshall Tanner as one of the definitive fictional P.I.s if more readers knew about him."
2,Corona 3 tine hoe review,"I bought these hoes trying to loosen up clay type soil in my yard, and now I have two broken hoes, they apparently weren't up to the task. I didn't hit many rocks, but was troubled by the tined portion of the tool, that kept pulling out of the end of the tool, and falling onto the ground, requiring it be reinserted. I ended up having one of the hoes fracture off two of the three tines, and the other developed a fracture laterally along the lower plastic retaining sleeve, rendering them both useless. I'd love to be able to return these for a refund, since I had to go to the local big box store and purchase a better constructed steel cultivator/tined rake to finish the job. I don't recommend anyone purchase these unless they can redesign the tool to retain the working end of the device that can only slip into the plastic retaining sleeve, and it kept falling out then fell apart-very annoying!"
3,Information overload!,"When I first read the book, it took me alwhile to actually understand what was going on. There are way to may characters to keep up with, the action parts are very dull and short, but the story is deep and emotional. You have to reread most of the time, and back track after a few chapters. Overall, the book is entertaining but confusing."
1,obnoxiously bad,"This entire series is ridiculous and insults my intelligence. I can scarcely follow the characters development, for they seemingly alter fundamental personality traits at the drop of a hat. The entire juvenile plot is built like some fifth grade fairy tale, with random plot elements built in willy-nilly like the contraption of some insane inventor's apprentice. I can't believe I sat through the first two, and half of the third one. Stay away."
5,Cactus Pears,"I love cactus pears, and getting high quality is worth every cent of the shipping. Overnight or second day overnight is the only to go to get the freshest product. I buy on-line often, and I am very happy with the products I receive."
2,Surprised at all the great reviews,"After just 4 weeks, the inner lining is seperating and coming out, and the velcro isn't sticking anymore. You should also know that this shoe is not really for narrow feet. The velcro won't allow you to adjust for width. I think it's probably a medium width shoe and won't adjust to anything else. Also, when we got the shoes, I was very surprised by how there was absolutely NO padding in the shoe. The leather is really soft and the soles are really flexible... but I don't think it's meant for a lot of walking. They are cute... but don't expect to get a lot of wear out of them..."
2,blood pressure monitor,I am sorry to say the machine did not function as advertised. i am returning it for repair.
4,ADC-Advantage Blood Pressure Monitor,"It does the job. My mistake, I thought it had memory and it does not.It is very accurate and easy to use. It is a one person machine which is very important.Susan Wilkes"
5,very satisfied,"As the old saying goes [it was just what the doctor ordered]my wife is very happy with the product,the price was right,and it was a quality item.It arrived in a reasonable time frame and was in the condition you would expect it to be.I would deffinately buy from these sellers again,and would surely reccomend them, as I am doing right now with this review.thankyou.Christopher Woodall."
4,HFA00,HFA 00The ADC Advance Semi-Auto Upper Arm Digital Blood Pressure Monitor serves one well when used accurately.
5,Our Christian Heritage... Indeed!,Thank you David Barton for this wonderful DVD and sharing the recorded historical facts about our early history. The influence of the Bible on the United States is undeniable.
5,Great!,I purchased this as a gift for my husband. He loves the history of our America. Amazing to see God's role in our great nation.
1,Mean-spirited and Misleading!,"Save your money. This book is not only disappointing (and misleading), but mean-spirited in its intent and execution."
1,attention to readers: this book is a complete waste.,"This book is so amateurish, so flimsey. In fact, its nothing more than a pamphlet filled with little usefull information. When I saw it in a bookstore -- I marvelled at how anyone could see clear to spend more than a couple bucks on it. I just don't want to see people who can't actually see this book waste their good money and order it over the internet."
2,Overpriced but good for teens,"Prior to buying this book, I read a review that said it was too simple for real office professionals but good for teens just entering the workplace as a starter guide. I think that is a good appraisal.So I bought the book as a gift for a teen just graduating from high school.As a gift for a teen, I am disappointed with the sketchy, plain cover and the sketch quality of the illustrations.I am also disappointed that including shipping and handling I paid some $17 or $18 and received a book that looks like I paid $2 for it. Therefore, it is not well suited as a stand-alone gift either. This was not a ""good deal.""In spite of it's cheap appearance and thinness, the information inside is good for a first, elementary, book on dress and conduct."
1,guide to throwing money out the window,This book merely states the obvious and does not shed any light on the current proffesional atmosphere with a realistic view. after reading part of this book it is apparent that this author has little or no experience in the real business world.
2,Save Your Money!,This book is not for the reader who wants to be a real gentleman. It is full of simpleton advice that is almost laughable. Save your money and read something better written.
2,Basic Information,"Overall, this book was very basic. But if you require more details into fashion coordination, look eleswhere. No pictures to help one understand color cordinates or details, just a few illustrations."
5,I love it!,"Finally, a useful, straight-forward book on the business world. This book led me by the hand and showed me how to dress and act at work. If you appreciate a well written book, then this book is for you."
5,Love it,My dad got me this for graduation and I love it. Simple and to the point - just what I need.
4,a fantastic guide to conduct for the young gentleman.,"greenleaf's 'attention to detail' provides the young gentleman entering the professional world with all the schooling and training that, until now, only years in prep school and elite colleges could provide. he covers everything from how to dress professionally and how to conduct yourself, all the way through etiquette and chivalry. i wouldnt let anyone work for my company until they've read his guide. and i certainly will give a copy to any college kid who shows up to an interview with jeans on! a true gem..."
2,"a teens guide, not a gentleman's guide","this book should be titled ""professional appearance for dummies"". most of the information is very very basic. remember, this book is only 51 pages all inclusive. in that space, it covers dressing, posture, emailing, eating, etc. not a lot of information on any topic.on top of that, some of the information is wrong. for instance, the author derates asymmetrical tie knots like the half windsor as unprofessional. this is inaccurate and the half windsor is one of the three most popular tie knots for business. (another - the four in hand - the most common - is also asymmetrical)if you ""don't do nuance"" and want a couple of rules to live by - this is your book. alternately, if you are young and need a good introduction, read this. otherwise, its really not worth the money."
5,I Love This Book!,This is the best little guide! I keep it on my desk at work and people are always running in to ask me advice (which usually means they look at the book). I think every guy in business should have a copy of it because the information in here is priceless!
2,The Title Should Be a Tip-off!,"I'm going to try to be objective here, because I strongly disagree with Ezola's politics and her decision to run as Pat Buchanan's running mate. However, there is no escaping the fact that this book is poorly written. She jumps from topic to topic, but the soapbox speech is the same every time. Her arrogance is distracting. ""What's Right for All Americans""???? Come on, who would profess to know such a thing? The clincher for me is when she writes an open letter to Rosa Parks, suggesting that the icon is a fraud and unworthy of our respect. I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it in print.And I was going to be objective! All in all, I would expect something so revolting to be a more interesting read."
5,Tetris Worlds for XBOX,I really like this game. We played it over the holidays with my family and it was addictive! It is hard to find a game that my sister and wife will play but with this game we do not have that problem. I really like that you can listen to your own music while playing. An XBOX only feature!! It is a little different thatn the other Tetris games that I have played but it is worth buying!!
2,Tetris - nothing like the original we all grew up with,"I rented this game to see if what is any good, and i hate it after one day... i'm so used to the orginal that came with every gameboy, the this game just seems weird to me... each time you reach a new level the game stops and asks you if you want to play some more... yes the new games are an added benefit, but they're nothing to make up for the fact that it is a completely different tetris... i would recommend that no one buy this, but rent it first to see if you like it. i definitely didn't."
3,Not the Excitement I Rember / Good for Newbies,"For new causal gamers who never played Tetris before, this is quite good. However, for those trying to relive memories from the past, I didn't think it was anything special. The graphics are better, but I miss the block-style from before and the old music. The music is all new techno and none of the old. The menus and multi-player seem quite unpolished. I haven't played the single-player form though."
2,NOT IMPRESSED! But this game came free with our xbox,"I was really excited when I purchased our xbox to see that Tetris was one of the free games that came with our system. This was the first game I played on the xbox and I was not impressed. I have played tetris on just about every console that made this game. I always liked it and loved to play Tetris. My expectations of this game was the graphics would be great and it would have lots of new things added to it....wrong! The game is very hard to see, they have a tiny screen for the game play and a background on the sides- why??? If they would have made this game full screen I might have given it a better review. I have a 36' tv and I can hardly see to play this game! My husband also complained about this. Not a good choice, but it was free, so who can complain too much?"
2,I bought this used and still not worth it,"This game is super lame. I played it for all of 5 minutes and then put it in its case and haven't looked at it since. It's really boring, and the levels suck. It's just tetris, there's nothing more, and it's really easy and boring. I bought it for 1/3 of the price listed on amazon and I still hate it. Go with something else."
1,Do not buy this book,Complete waste of time for professionals - too simplistic with no real troubleshooting for most components
5,Helpful,"wonderfully written, a real asset to the person that less than knowledgeable in the field. Is able to read this book and have a better grasp of the subject. The content is intriguing as well."
4,What About Wanda?,"No doubt this is a very good movie, and the crispness of the photography plays well on DVD. There's lots of good review material above, but what happened to Wanda, the supposed key witness? Did the other prisoner get released? Maybe this is in the commentary track. I skipped to the final scence after seeing the entire movie, and listened for some additional info about the final release. None was heard. 777 seems to have some additional symbolism that may have been overlooked. Wiecek was one very lucky (three 7's) fellow to be freed.I believe in the trailer there's a suggestion the story was featured in Time and Reader's Digest magazine. Maybe in 1948. Perhaps more of the story can be found there. Too bad they didn't use these sources to tell more of the story in the sparse extras."
4,"Entertaining, classic docu-noir. Campy by 1999 standards.","Good, early Jimmy Stewart work about a man wrongly convicted of a cop murder. Based on a true story, Stewart plays a Chicago reporter who is inspired by an offer of a reward to investigate the case.This 1948 movie, while interesting for its murder story content, is overlooked for its showcasing of the use of technology to resolve a crime. Look for a lie detector test (administered by the actual inventor), photographic enhancement and digital transfer of data as keys in the story - all in 1948. Interesting to note that, ""Blade Runner"" had similar uses of technology to help sniff out the bad guys and let the good go free."
3,Little Fire in Chicago Story,"The documentary style employed here may have been revolutionary for it's time but to me it undermined the urgency of the story being told. What this film needed was a little flair in relating the story of an ace reporter(James Stewart) who is trying to free a man (Richard Conte) of a cop-killing conviction. The location scenery is nice and the black-and-white cinematography works effectively, too, but maybe this film needed a little editing to punch up the story. Stewart is adequate here and nothing more. The best performance delivered here is probably by Conte in the few scenes he is given. A major annoyance here is the use of voice-over narration that pops up at intervals with little rhyme or reason."
3,Not quite noir enough for me,"I am a big fan of film noir and I grew up in Chicago and knew many people like the ones featured here so I expected to like this more than I did. Jimmy Stewart wasn't convincing as the hard nosed big city newspaperman, at least to me; I found his attempts at talking tough sort of silly. The story is quite predictable--we know from the first five minutes what's going to happen. Actually, after about an hour and fifteen minutes, I pulled the plug. Maybe if I'd stuck it out I would have liked it better; we'll never know.I think if you are dyed in the wool Stewart fan you'll probably like anything he does, including this. For others...there are many better films noir available."
3,For Film History Buffs,"""Call Northside 777"" is a sincere, though somewhat overly earnest attempt at docudrama-neo realist style. Part of the problem, at least for contemporary audiences, is 777's over-reliance on stock character types (the saintly mother, the intrepid reporter, the gruff city editor, etc) of which there seems to be no shortage of here. Such dusty artifice, coupled with a predictable man-wrongly-accused plot, quickly undermines all compelling sense of realism. If anything, the film seems stiff, a precursor to the terse, straightjacket style of TV's Dragnet. Hitchcock gave a more lucid (and more moving) exploration to this sort of material with his aptly titled ""The Wrong Man,"" which captures the neo-realist style with greater ease and tenderness.777 is strictly film buff stuff, nontheless, it's black and whites cinematography looks smashing in this DVD's crisp presentation. Definitely worth a look if film noir history is your bag."
3,Stewart Toughens Up,"A dated crime drama made palatable by Henry Hathaway's documentary-style direction and James Stewart's determined Chicago reporter. ""Call Northside 777"" (1948) marked the beginning of the actor's harder-edged screen persona - thus paving the way for his collaborations with Anthony Mann and Alfred Hitchcock. Though predictable and slow-going at times, Stewart's compelling performance holds the film together."
5,Call Northside 777 film review,"Upon viewing Call Northside 777 (Fox Film Noir), starring James Stewart, I was quite interested in the scenes filmed in Chicago, circa 1948. My grandparents' building (since torn down in the 60's) was included in the film. Quite a mystery presented itself, with James Stewart's character digging into what really occurred in the murder of the police officer in the early thirties."
3,A straightforward procedural,"I don't consider this noir, it's a free-an-innocent-man neo-realist procedural more in the vein of Naked City or, even, Dragnet. Jimmy Stewart takes low-key to new lows, his wife appears briefly and supportingly, Lee J. Cobb underplays and remains a cipher, there's no mystery here about how it will end and the journey isn't especially interesting or entertaining.As others have noted, it does provide a glimpse of the Polish immigrant community in Chicago after WWII and a look inside an amazing prison. What caught my ear were the 2 or 3 times where the script intentionally indicates that Chicago has the finest police force in the world, anything that happened happened in the old days, we're so over that, etc."
5,Classic noir,One of the best film noir available. Suspensful and moves at a great pace. This is a must see film for anyone who is a Jimmy Stewart fan. He really does an excellent job in the role of the crusading reporter. I would highly recommend this film to everyone.
5,Excellent quality lopper,Not much to say: this is a quality item. Works great and a pleasure to use.
2,"poor blade quality, great customer service","After an hour of testing the cutter on 1"" branches, the blade edges were bent/dull. I called customer support and they sent me a new set of blades for free, that was very nice!.. but what good is it if they only last an hour. It seems lkie the blades were not hardened, damaged on 1"" limbs!?!? My 10yr old $28 Ace Hardware clippers are still as sharp as day one and have seem major use/abuse."
3,Returned,I returned this lopper to Amazon because it was advertised as made in the USA and when I got it it was made in Mexico. That was over a month ago and the Amazon ad still says Made in USA. Maybe they got a different shipment or something. I didn't want to rate the lopper having never used it but they made me do it so I gave it 3 stars for looking like a quality lopper. I'm just trying to buy USA made stuff.
4,Printer works fine,"I bought this printer to print the occasional photograph and for the built in fax and scanner. I use a color laser printer for heavy duty printing but find the duplex unit on the HP 7410 to make it so useful that I have started using it a bit more. The wireless connection is just gravy.So far, I have had no problems at all. Everything works great, prints great, scans great, and have had no networking issues.Only complaint is the one all inkjets get and that is that the cartridges are expensive and don't last long at all. Otherwise, no complaints in 4 or 5 months."
1,If you travel DON'T EVEN CONSIDER this product,"HP driver software is junk - you probably already know that - but if you intend to use this printer in wireless mode and intend to travel with your laptop to a different network, you can count on your computer locking up. HP will guide you through a re-install, which will take you about 1 hour, each time you change networks. Your computer will be unusable until you complete this process. If you can live with that each time you change networks, this product is for you!HP acknowledges this problem exists, that they have known about it since 2005, and that there is no fix."
1,Don't try to move it!,"We moved the machine from one room to another. Since we reconnected it, we get an error message and it does not work at all. No one dropped it, no one changed a thing, just picked it up and moved it 15' and gently put it down. We're going to see how much it costs to get if fixed and I bet the tech tells me it's not worth it!"
1,This printer is a nightmare,"I've had major headaches trying to get this product to work. Each time I contact Tech Suport, they point me to a convoluted procedure of deleting registry keys, unisnstalling, deleting files, and finally reinstalling - this exercise takes about 45 minutes and ends up breaking something else. They've had me do it 4 times now!In my 17 years as a Systems Analyst I've run up against buggy software and hardware but this particular product is hands down the most remarkably poorly assembled dog's breakfast I have ever encountered.I got it on sale for $200 - and am disgusted with myself for having wasted my money...This thing is even too light to make for a suitable boat anchor.sigh...."
2,very difficult software,"including My business locations, and my residences, I own no less than 6 HP printers including two HP All in Ones (7410 and 2500). I like the functionality of the AIO's -fax print scan and copy - HOWEVER HP's software is very sensitive and subject to constant reloads. I lose the wireless ability repeatedly on this as well as on the HP 2500 I own. This is a problem! Speaking with HP Customer Service or internet contact is a joke. They try but are lacking on product knowledge. I love the quality of print and ink printing capabilites of HP but think it is time to try Cannon. My next AIO will NOT be HP."

1,No good Vinyl,My vinyl doesn't workI just have to say that I spent 22dollars on a vinyl and I can't even listen to it
3,"Helpful, to a point","The book offers a lot of tips early on explaining ways to avoid keeping everything in the headers to permit changes to occur without forcing a load of code to recompile.My problem was that to avoid this recompilation the code has to get very confusing in hiding methods and variables.I'm halfway through the book and a reread will definitely be required, but I guess all good things come at a cost. And when he is referring to large he is referring to applications which take multiple hours to compile. Smaller apps probably won't benefit as much.The tips also lead towards saving time during the building/compiling stage while sacraficing application speed.It's best point is that it brings up development issues which often get overlooked."
2,Has Anyone Read this Book?,"If you read Chapter 6, Lakos makes recommendations that would result in the most butchered code imaginable. C++ is the worst language ever invented (is it even possible to do worse?), and this would make a bad thing even worse. Anyone who ever fully implemented Lakos' proposals would have a set of code that only a well-paid masochist would be willing to maintain.Many of the good ideas are common sense that are better covered in other books."
4,"Quick delivery, great price, good movie",Loved this movie very nostalgic in terms of Napa/Sonoma Valleys during thetime I was a student at UCD in the late 60's and 70's.
1,Didn't enjoy it,"This movie is very campy and simplistic. If you want to see a very unrealistic, and overly simplistic, portrayal of this region and time period this it it."
3,good movie,"The dated story was very good, but the sound quality of the DVD was bad. Audio needs to be improved."
5,A great and overlooked film,"My family loves this movie. It covers the big turning point in the world's view of California wines, and does so in a very entertaining, pleasing and fun manner. The writing is sharp. All the performances are good. We're HUGE Alan Rickman fans and he is a delight. Dennis Farina is a scene-stealer. We didn't recall this film's release in theaters, so it was a sleeper hit for us. We've watched it several times now and have shared it with family & friends, who have all thoroughly enjoyed it too."
5,Great Movie,Based on a true story. Funny and very informative. Loved it. Have given several DVD's as gifts! Everyone loves this movie!!!
5,Shocked!,"What a wonderfully entertaining, yet educational, movie. After watching it many times on TV I just had to buy the movie. It's entertaining on it's own, but knowing the history behind it makes it a must have for anyone it the US that appreciates a great wine. If you remember the 70's, you gotta see this! By the way, Alan Rickman ROCKS!"
5,Great movie if you are a wine lover!!!!,"It is a revised version of what put California on the map in regards to top quality wines. In a blind tasting in the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, 10 of the top French experts in wine picked Napa Valley wines both Red and White, Stags Leap and Chateau Montelena respectively as the best wines in the world.It was repeated again in 2006 and California won both categories again, go figure. I loved it!"
4,A savory film,"Saw this movie last night on satellite and missed the first 30 minutes, but really enjoyed it. Love Alan Rickman. We kind of take for granted now in the USA the quality and quantity of US produced wines, but it wasn't always this way. This film is a nice, light historical introduction into the development of the US wine industry, thanks to Napa, CA. Anyway, a much much better film than Sideways and yes, the love triangle adds nothing to the movie, but doesn't overwhelm the film like the relationship scenes and storylines in Sideways."
4,"Great Story, Great Music!","This story is so engaging that it's easy to forget that it's all true! For those of us who survived the sixties (and seventies), the music is a bonus. It really takes you back."
5,Great movie!,"I happened on this movie some time in the last year and loved it. It's a feel-good movie based on a true story. It has a little of everything: drama, comedy, suspense, and a bit of romance. For Christmas, I was searching for an idea for my hard-to-buy-for brother and came up with the idea to pair this movie with a bottle of the wine around which the story is built. It was a perfect gift for my brother who is something of a wine connoisseur. Bottom line: Bottle Shock is worth the watch!"
3,movie,This movie was really good I enjoyed my purchase very much. Looking forward to farther further video purchases I am I buy more movies on amazon thank you very much it was in new condition.
4,Wonderful,Simply delightful. Loved how it opened. The music and scenery werequite captivating. It didn't matter that I didn't know a thing aboutwine. Totally fantastic cast. Loved it! Am going to buy the DVD for my Dad. Afew questions though: The sword use had to embellishment right? Couldyou really rent a Gremlin? What's with the boxing?
5,Bottle Shock,"Wow, what a great movie! You can sense the passion for perfection that is expressed in the film both by the director as well as the characters.Here are the extras on the DVD. Looks really good.Commentary by Randall Miller, Jody Savin, Ross Schwartz, Lannette Pabon, Chris Pine, J. Todd Harris, Bill Pullman & Eliza DushkuAn Underdog's Journey: The Making of Bottle ShockChateau Montelena: One Winery's Search for ExcellenceDeleted Scenes:""It Was Just Sex""First AlternateThe Second Wine ScamBo and Sam Make LoveTrailer Farm: Theatrical Trailer"
2,Shlock is more like it,"Leaden dialogue, predictable story, tedious subplots. Alan Rickman manages to inject some much-needed humour, but the rest of the cast struggle to breathe life into this screenplay."
3,"If you're a child of the 60's, this is a must see.","Good soundtrack, familiar events and is fun to draw the parallels between the events in the movie and what was going on in my personal life at the time. Enjoyable but maybe not good for younger viewers due to mature subject matter."
4,Bottle Shock,I have seen this movie a couple times and it is a very warm story and it is based on a true story. This year for Christmas I purchased a bottle of the wine from the winery in the movie for a gift for a family member.
2,Ho Hum,"The movie is a cookie cutter version of Mark Twain s ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" novel, except set in wine country. The only deviation was the wine snob and they substituted the abusive Aunt for an abusive Father and a boat for a surf board. OK, the surf board...........this is Napa and he drove to the beach to surf?"
4,Excellent Movie,Very fun and informative. The only weakness was the love story. Maybe some portions of this plot were left on the cutting room floor?
4,California Wine Appreciation 101,Rickman is classic in this tale of how Napa Chardonnay won a French competition in 1974. Beautifully shot--the helicopter work over the vineyards is breathtaking--this movie sits alongside Sideways and A Very Good Year in my wine appreciation library.And isn't that Mike Grgich eating a roast chicken?
4,"Very good movie, not perfect.",definitely enjoyed the movie and so did the GF. alittle slow in the middle but you really felt emotion and empathy for the CA growers. Amazing to see how the wine industry got it's reputation.would watch again.
1,Horrible distortion of a good story poorly witten and horribly acted,"This is highly fictionalized account of a fascinating story. Very little about the story other than the outcome of the tasting is even close to the truth. Do yourself a favor curl up in a good reading chair with George Taber's non-fiction accountJudgment of Paris: California vs. France and the Historic 1976 Paris Tasting That Revolutionized Wine. A much richer and more interesting account of how a group of bohemian 50's and 60's intellectuals lit the match on outstanding wines from around the globe.See the movie if you want a light bit of fluff that's pure fiction. The plot lines don't make sense, the acting is second rate and the sex is fleeting and gratuitous."
3,You need to be a wine lover to enjoy this movie,"Wine lovers will enjoy this movie. The cinematography is awesome, the acting good and a script that is wanting and fails to deliver full bodied character or story development. The book Judgment of Paris by George M. Taber who was the only journalist (Time Magazine) present at the event in 1976 does more story development in it's first few pages (free Kindle preview available) than this entire movie delivers. The hope was this movie would be a home run like Sideways (which I rate five stars), it barely manages to get to first base. I'm glad I watched it on NetFlix and did not buy it. If you're into wine it is worth watching. The people who rate this movie five stars must love drinking two buck chuck and would no doubt rate it 5 stars as well."
4,Bottle Shock movie,this was given as a gift so I don't know what the quality of the film was but the arrival was fast and the price was right. I hope my giftee enjoys it.
3,Pretty pleasant and predictable,This light comedy/drama about how the Californian wine industry beat the snobby French at their own game on their own home court slips down like a pleasant Chardonnay. It's certainly not deep and quite predictable but it's harmless fun enlivened by a great performance by Alan Rickman as a snobby Brit who runs a snobby wine shop in snobby Paris.Off he goes to the Napa Valley to find the best American vintages to compete in a blind tasting. He runs into a rag-tag bunch of cliches all clamoring to be seen and heard -- the proud former lawyer who chucked it in to run a vineyard and is on the verge of going broke; his hippy wastrel son; his proud Mexican employee and his attractive blond bombshell summer intern.It all bubbles up nicely like the Widow Clicquot's best champagne into a pleasing finish that lingers only slightly on the palate and in the memory before dissolving into effervescence.
4,Mon Dieu....Napa!,"This charming little film about the ascendency of California's Napa Valley vineyards is a delightful diversion. Solidly anchored by Alan Rickman as the English wine connoisseur with his shop in Paris on one end and Bill Pullman as the tyro Napa vintner on the other end, the story is light, amusing, based on fact, and fascinating with both its detail and obvious appreciation for the wine grower's passion and expertise.The youngsters filling out the cast are fine, and the story builds to the factual 1976 tasting that shocked the French wine world and began the explosion of wine production worldwide that we see today. A nice bit of history wrapped in a pleasant light comedy. Well done, and worthwhile."
4,Bottle Shock Review,Loved it even if all the facts were not true. Enjoyable movie showing the underdog rise again. Would recommend for those who enjoy wine
3,Could have been much better,The actual story is such a great one. It's too bad Hollywood mucked it up. I was disappointed that the writers/editors/directors felt they had to add a sappy and irrelevant love story to a film that should have been much more about the wine and how California rose to international recognition.
3,Great Movie for the Wine Enthusiast,"This was a great movie of a monumentous event that really catapulted California wines into the world-wide marketplace. Having known the story before watching the movie, it was interesting to visually see the story played out on the big screen. Bill Pullman makes a great Jim Barrett (in fact, I think this is one of Bill's better roles). However, the romance portion of the movie was a bit forced as it seems movie producers think you need to have a love story in every movie or it won't fly. Definitely would recommend for anyone with more than a passing interest in wine; but for general public, they could probably take it or leave it."
4,Wine is nice,"Surprisingly entertaining and made me want to track down the wineries mentioned in the film. The characters are interesting and the plot keeps you involved. I recommend it as a great Friday night movie and popcorn night. With wine, of course!"
2,Does not due justice to the book!,"Bottle Shock is based on the excellent historical book, Judgment of Paris, which describes the amazing growth of the wineries in California and the tasting between California and French wines in 1976 in which one of the cabernets took first over the French Bourdeux and one California Chardoney took first place over the French white bourdeux. The book really is head and shoulders better than the film which portrays only one wine and the associated people who brought that wine to Paris. The film also has very flimsy romantic subplot which is the usual modus operandi of hollywood to spice up the movie. I recommend reading the book and forgetting the film."
4,The best wine movie to date,Bottle shock is a nice lower budget movie that depicts the events that lead to the increased popularity of California Wines.
2,Not what you would expect,"If you are not that interested in wine or learning anything about the '76 tasting, then you'll probably enjoy this movie. It's a very superficial 'feel-good' story of a father & son & hot intern. Even as such, you never get to know or care about the characters very much.I get that this isn't supposed to be an educational documentary but a few more details would have been nice. For instance - why was the Napa wine better? What are the high-level differences in winemaking style between France & US? What happened at the red wine tasting? Was the tasting really held in a run-down building with no roof?I really wanted to see this movie and really wanted to like this movie. I am very interested in wine & viticulture and any film that promotes and feeds this interest, I have to see. But honestly this movie was disappointing."
5,Fun and informative,Great movie to just enjoy a glass of wine with. Very informative on ways of some wine makers.
1,Even Alan Rickman can't save this movie,"Alan Rickman is the only good thing about this movie. It is otherwise filled with bad acting, stilted dialogue, bad wigs, and filmed 85% of the time between the hours of 5-7 pm during the sun setting to make everything look better than it actually was. The true story is remarkable, but this filmmaker's vision dumbed it down to a cliche. Even Alan Rickman can't save this movie, it even makes him look bad. It so bad, that I even bother to spend some time to tell Amazon readers how bad it is. This is not a documentary, but the film makers fantasy of what California, and the wine county might be like. It is so stupid."
2,"beautifully shot, terrible writing","This movie had wonderful potential but every line made me cringe... forced character developement, layers of cliches -- but really enjoyed the scenery."
1,"God, this is terrible","Uncertain (but showy nevertheless) direction, half-baked script, characters that generate zero warmth and an unbelievable narrative await you with this rancid DVD. After 10 minutes, I said to my wife, ""We have a directing problem here."" She said, ""No, we have an everything problem.""Randall Miller may be the most inept director I've seen in some time. He has absolutely no idea what to do with the camera and an editing sytle that borders on psychotic. Chris Pine evokes absolute revulsion in his characterization of Bo. (Did he really show up at the Paris contest in the same t-shirt he wore in Napa? Help me.)The character Sam decides to sleep with Gustavo and then Bo for what reason again? Huh? The Napa growers decide to send layabout Bo the bum to Paris to represent them. What? Bo and his father have repeated violent boxing matches for exactly what reason?Enough."
5,Bottle Shock,"Bottle ShockI just saw this movie while crossing the Atlantic Ocean. It is a must see for all wine lovers. Especially the wine-o's whom have heard about the 1976 Paris wine tasting that put Napa valley on the map. It is well produced and the story line is fantastic. I will cretainly purchase the DVD and put it right next to my copy of ""Sideways"", another exceptional wine-lovers movie."
5,great!,"It's definitely an awesome movie... very pleasantly surprised at how good the plot is (despite knowing how it ends already), and how entertaining the movie is throughout. It's odd that they don't offer a Blu-Ray version, or I would have bought that instead...We hated ""Sideways"", but loved watching ""Bottle Shock""!Makes for a great gift, too, since nobody's heard of it and it's surprisingly good. Got one for my mom and she absolutely loved it."
4,Pleasantly Surprised!,"I wasn't sure I was going to like this movie...I watched it only because AR is in it and he usually delivers an excellent performance regardless of the script. I must say I was not disappointed. The ""younger"" characters seemed a little distracting from the story line at times, and I wonder if they really needed them as much as they were in there (that's why I didn't give it 5 stars). Over all this is an excellent movie! I especially enjoyed the humor in it!"
4,Amazing Independent Reality-Based Film,I was on an Alan Rickman binge and found this film. It was a really pleasent discovery. There are some great performances surrounding a surprising story that has dramatic and comedic elements.
4,Forgiving Dr. Mengele,Excellent! Excellent message and the fact that she had the audacity to stand against many that felt she had no right to forgive makes her phenomnal. Forgiving is not forgetting.
4,What might have been,"There's that mixture of joy and sadness again, last heard in Bryan McLean's madly-inspired home demos (Ifyoubelievein). This batch of almost-theres and not-quites works wonderfully as a melancholic souvenir of Ham's could-have-been-brilliant career, which was tragically cut short by his suicide. This second collection of private tapes is a trip to a better musical place --- for both Badfinger obsessives and pop lovers who never really cared about the group or its wonderful guitarist/writer. A listen to such beautiful works-in-progress as Dawn, Where Will You Be and Makes Me Feel Good (two versions of which bookend the disc) should convert even skeptics."
5,A revelation!,"I bought this CD completely cold, knowing nothing about Pete Ham or his music beyond the Badfinger hits. I listened to it in my car on the way home, and by the third track I noticed that every hair on my body was standing on end. For fans of late 60s pop (Beatles, Beach Boys, Kinks) this CD is a revelation. It also foreshadows 90s home recordist songwriters like Liz Phair, Elliot Smith, and Jack Logan."
4,A fine follow up to 7 Park Ave,"It's amazing the tracks that Pete (or the band) felt weren't up to Badfinger's standard. This follow up to 7 Park Ave has a number of fine moments, but is more fragmented than its predecessor.While, from a historical perspective, all the tracks are essential there are a number that could have been removed without effecting the overall quality of the disc. Producer Dan Matovani deserves praise for returning to the well of Pete Ham songs to produce this for the fans. It puts the Badfinger legacy into better perspective. While the other members of the band were important, clearly Ham was both the most prolific and talented member."
3,"A little disappointing, compared to 7 Park Avenue","It is true that Pete Ham was a great songwriter, and that is easily obvious on the first CD,""7 Park Avenue"". This compilation though, is far less consistent. You can tell they were scraping the bottom of the bucket to put together this one. No doubt about it. Many of the songs sound unfinished or are instances where Pete is just fooling around with an instrument such as the drums, not even playing an actual song, with voices in the background sometimes. There ARE a few good solid songs here such as ""A Lonely Day"", Dawn, Without You, I'm so Lonely, but the 7 Park Avenue CD is a much better place to start if you're new to Pete Ham's music."
2,Don't make this your first Mu-ziq buy!!!,"If you REALLY want to listen to Mu-ziq's best stuff, check out Tango'n'Vectif and Bluff Limbo. Beautiful works of art... Paradinas has kinda gone downhill since those two beauties."
2,Illegitimate Bastards,"A collection of outcast bastards from daddy Paladinas' fascinating ""Lunatic Harness"" family. Being a Mu-ziq fan I gave these guys a fair shake. Indeed these tracks have all the smooth under-melodies and hard break beat cuts as their pedigree main album brothers. But somehow they do not possesss the legerdemain of the Mu-ziq name. Maybe if they had been secretly held over into the next CD they could have blended in and stood their ground. I agree that they were not added to the main CD as this would have diluted it's intensity. Track #7 ""Abmoit"" does grab your interest with a unique stylistic presentation. Even the CD cover shows daddy turning his back on these feeble bastards. And why would he name one boy ""Losers March""?"
5,Everything that I ever wanted to listen,"Mu-ziq is not just an electronic musician. This Ep (as his album ""Lunatic Harness"") are not just electronic albuns. His music is universal. Mu-ziq puts in it everything that I ever wanted to listen: Beats that are so complex that almost ""talk"" with inspired and cheerfull melodies."
4,Very nice album,"The first track ""Brace Yourself (Remix)"" is so darn good. How can anyone not listen to that song and not just start giggling like a little girl is beyond me, it is like some whacked out happy hardcore track. This is a funk curing album, if you feel unhappy just put it in and it will wipe away any bad feelings you might have. Other than that ""Summer Living"" is the other highlight, another great warm piece of work. Mu-ziq's stuff sounds like he has fun making it, and you can really feel it through the music. This is an album you can put into the cd player and just forget about, nothing is skip worthy, sure there are a few ""weak"" songs, but none warrant a skipping.A great EP, fans of good music check it out."
2,I happened to have five CDs from this guy.,"I was dissappointed. It didn't live up to my expectations. Unstructured, beats are not well thought-out. Unmelodious, it severely lacks musical theories whatsoever. Chaos can be great but this is simply overdone.I like The Auteurs VS Mu-Ziq, probably because The Auteurs lent Mike some great tunes."
1,Disapointing,"I really can't stand this album.I like songs with more action and energy, andthis has no flavor or beat to it."
3,Passable Biography,"This is a decent biography, but it leaves so much out. We are fortunate that Mosel was able to interview many people who knew Miss Cornell, but the book comes off as too fawning. The definitive bio still needs to be written, perhaps with an eye to how Miss Cornell changed the theater in America and her impact upon it. We need a good bio for today's generation which has all but forgotten about her."
5,Digital Camera,This camera is great for kids my son is 7 and loves this thing. He wanted a digital camera and I looked all over. I happened to come across this I got it b/c I couldn't find a digital camera for kids with a good review. So I figured the video one would do. This camera takes video and still pictures and my son has had hours of fun with this. If your kid likes to take pictures pick this up.
4,Loads of fun,"I bought (4) cameras - one each for my niece & nephews for XMas. They've had a blast making videos & taking stills. The only drawbacks are that they burn through batteries quickly and picture darkness. (They require a lot of light for clear picts.) Overall, best presents I ever bought!!"
4,Vcam Now,"I have two boys 8 and 6 and they both got it from Santa and love it. It is a toy, so don't expect adult camcorder quality, but for the money, it is worth it. Plus it is a camcorder/digital camera. The boys take it everywhere and take their own pics/movies and I download their stuff and they also view them on their VideoNow machines. I think it is worth the buy. Just my two cents."
5,A very neat little toy!,"My 8 year old got this camera for Christmas and constantly fills up the little 32MB hard drive within a day. It's cute, easy to use and so far we've only had to replace the batteries one time.Please note though! I had problems with the 2GB SD cards so I called support... the product specs up there are WRONG! The 2.0 camera will only work with a ONE (1) GB SD/MMC memory card. You can still get a ton out of a 1GB card though, from what support estimated about 224 minutes of video OR 2560 pictures.I highly recommend this camera to a little one that can learn how to use the big easy to push buttons all the way up to an adult that just wants a fun little camera to play with. The video has to be shot in a semi well lit area but will adjust the best it can and the pictures are an average size. You get what you pay for but IMO this is a fantastic little toy."
2,VCAM made it through wash!,My 8 year old son was very disappointed with the quality of pictures. There is no flash and most pictures are hard to see. Pictures also have to taken with a VERY steady hand. Definitely not worth the $80. But it did make it through the washer and dryer and still works!
1,This toy is a piece of junk,"My son who is 12 bought this with his own money and it is just crap. The video quality is really poor, it's dark, and very unfocused and with the small pixel amount, you can't make out anything in the picture. He was SOOO disappointed because he had saved up his birthday money for this toy, that I took it back and got him a REAL camera.Obviously it's for kids, but if they have ever seen your video camera or digital camera, they will be disappointed in the quality of the images and the non-function of the camera."
4,great BEGINER VIDEOCAMERA,This is the perfect video camera for ppl(and me) who cant aford a sweet digital video camera. You cant use it in even a dem room.Only way to use it in dark rooms is with a night vision mod.30 minutes of video and somethin like 999 pictures can be done on this lil camera.Shis thing is a lil les then a inch wide and only the size of a credit card.So if your a beginer in video taping id get this but if you need something for experts id go with the 5000 something dollar digital video camera.
5,10 Frames a second???,I dont have this yet but 10 frames a second that just sucks. it will be so choppy. even the most crappy games run at least 15 frames per second
4,"It's a fun ""TOY""!!","My son just turned 7 and he got this for Christmas. HE LOVES IT.Please keep in mind, this is a child's toy. Don't think you are saving money and going to buy this instead of a real camera.No, you will not get that REAL camera quality, but for the price, it's fun and he certainly has gotten a lot of mileage off of it! It's gone to school with him. He's taken video of his friends! It's been a durable toy to hold up for a 6/7 year old boy!If you purchase the Media Wizard, you can then burn PVD's from your media you record from your VCam and play it on your VideoNow Player!"
4,VCamNow,I got this camria for christmas last year and I love it! My only complaints are the screen is very small! And there is no flash so you can't take good pictures in dim light. It does however take very good pictures outside!
2,Could it be any harder to determine line strength?,"If it's 20lb test, SAY that it's 20lb test. Don't do the ""20/8lb"" nonsense. It means it's 20lb test with the same diameter as ""normal"" 8lb test monofiliment. What's up with that? When did fishing become a techno-weenie adventure?Not at all what I wanted.I'm dropping the staars for a very confusing product description. I can't use it on my reels, and can't rate it as a fishing line, but the guy I gave it to was very happy to get it for salmon fishing."
1,Wrong size sent - buyer beware!,"I use Fireline for beading, and I just took out my new spool, only to find that I was not sent 6 lb test, but 14 pound test. This is over twice as thick as what I ordered and what I now still need. Six pound test is .15mm, what I was sent is 14 lb test which is .23mm. Useless, and I now I have to place a new order for what I thought I already bought. Very frustrating!"
3,Fair for the price,"I got this for myself about a week after Christmas, so I've had it more than three weeks. The system itself looks pretty sleek. The speakers do what they're supposed to and the Bass Boost is marginal. Recently the LCD has started flickering between the last digits on the radio station, and from time to time drops or rises two whole numbers, and thus loses the signal (this usually happens when I turn the radio on). The tape and CD play fine so far, though the CD whir is audible at close quarters. I didn't want to splurge on something expensive, so I opted for this. The other review for this item shows it's quality can be much worse. I got a cheap deal, and am content with it for now. If you're looking for something reliable, this is not the item to buy."
3,Playmobile pirate crew,"Do not recommend to small children who still put things in their mouth. parts of the priate, skeleton come off, could be a choking hazard."
4,entertains the children,"Don't let Amazons little picture of this fool you, there is only one doll with it and it comes with two ""rides"". The spin ride is a cute idea, you strap the dolls in their little cars and they twirl down the pole. You can also switch out the cars with the swings. Then there is the separate swing set toy where you can have 2 dolls swinging. It all appears fairly sturdy and my 4 year old has carried it around with her and played with it quite a bit. The little plastic pieces and outfits that come with it are pure nuisance items to me, I must pick them up ten times a day and eventually I throw them out, but the kids think they are tons of fun. I just think this particular Polly Pocket is a good choice because the set has some action to it with the spinning and swing. No batteries are needed and it is easy enough for the kids to do themselves."
4,just what I needed,"I bought these to attach to a couple mason jars to dispense soap and hand sanitizer. they work very well, I only wish that each pump would dispense a little more product..."
1,doesn't work,"These do not ""screw"" into or onto a bottle. they also do not fit snug inside or create a seal when snapped into a bottle. i would not recommend."
5,Great Product,"They work much better than the cork type, and the do not require any clue, all in all a great product, especially considering the price, I bought them for $15"
1,Lotion Pump Dispenser,I can not use this product as its screw-on cap is too large for my intended use. Until I find a larger bottle it will remain in storage.
1,pump dispensers--just too cheap,I was excited to find these for sale as I make soap/lotion dispensers with vintage mason jars. They just are so loose/wobbly and feel so cheap. I want to sell quality dispensers and these don't cut it. Very disappointed.
4,Decent for the money,"Some of the dispensers don't work or, instead of giving a nice even stream of hand soap, shoot it out at you. But, considering what I paid for them, worth the money."
1,Author Should be Embarassed!,Typos and broken writing are too distracting and destroy credibility of the author or organization. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK! It's designed to rope the buyer into a digital book club!
3,Ok but not amazing,THis DVD is good for those who remember to keep proper form most of the time. Otherwise the standing sections are useless. It got me sweating and I felt my stomach muscles burning but it's not my favorite ab/lower body workout. I like Shpresa's Double Pump Lower Body better but this DVD is good to rotate with other ab workouts
2,For beginners only,"I purchased this workout because I wanted a good workout focusing on my abs. As an intermediate level, I found this workout too easy and was disappointed to find myself not a bit sore the next day. I've even tried it several more times to make sure I wasn't doing the moves incorrectly or not putting in enough effort. Overall, it's probably designed for beginners just starting to workout, which would be a great ab workout in that case. But I prefer a workout DVD that's more challenging because then you can build up to a harder level or have a goal to attain. When I want to just do abs, I go back to my trusty ""I Want That Body"" DVD with Tamilee Webb instead."
2,Not for people who work out,"I tried this video and was completely bored. I did not feel my abs 'burning' at all and found this DVD to be too easy. I would recommend this to people who have never worked out before. Otherwise, stick to the gym ladies and gents...this is a waste of time and money."
2,disappointed,"The name ab attack sounded challenging, but this is light ab work. I was hoping to feel sore, but was not. I also couldn't stand the instructor's hip hop, party girl style. I would recommend to skip this video and keep looking."
3,Okay workout,"This workout is ""okay"". It is not particularly intense and the ""fat burning"" component is lacking, IMHO. I do like the standing ab work, but the floor work and the side lying planks could be both more intense and longer. It felt like I was on the floor for about 10 minutes before the floor segment was over.The instructor is pleasant, but the background exercisers are too hip and irritating. Typical ""Crunch croud"" I suppose."
3,Half of it is very good.,"Here are the sections:1 Warm up2 Standing core/abs3 Standing abs/obliques4 Mat upper/lower abs5 mat planks/lower back6 cool down/stretch1 & 2 seemed pretty useless to me. The instructor said it was a ""kick-butt cardio workout,"" but it didn't raise my heartrate at all. I don't remember 3 very well because I've only done it once so far, but the squats were effective since they made me pretty sore. 4 & 5 are definitely the best parts, and I've been skipping right to them. There's lots of variety and it leavs my abs feeling like they've been worked out pretty decently. I'd recommend doing that part twice if you want. It's about 10 minutes.The instructor is good. She's cheerful without being annoying. I don't regret buying this DVD, but it's annoying to have to skip past the non-effective parts."
3,"Ab attack maybe, fat blaster... not so much","I just used this video for the first time. I can't say I felt much by way of fat burning (my heart rate went up a little, but no sweating and I wasn't out of breath). In order for this to work you must remember to keep you abdominal muscles ""engaged"" while performing the exercises (which the instructor reminds you of periodically), if not this or any other ab workout video will be a waste of your time (which I suspect is what happened to the people who gave this a bad review).Overall, I feel it in my abs, but don't expect it to be a substitute for a your cardio workout.Just FYI if you're wondering what perspective this is coming from, I'm in my mid-20's and work out 5x a week strength training and running appx. 60 mins. I got this video to target my abs."
3,"Okay, somewhat easy","It's alright. If you want a half hour program with some dance moves and then some mat ab work, it's good. I agree with the concept of needing both cardio fat burning and ab work to get yourself a happy midsection, but the problem is that it's just not that intense and does both part way. I think that if you are just getting back into shape it would be good, but if you want the intensity one needs to get anywhere close to the stomach that the instructor has, you are going to need another video."
4,Decent,"As a former dancer, I already have pretty strong abs. I never feel the standing exercises, but I do feel most of the floor ones. I enjoy doing this workout because its not time consuming, I still manage to get my heart rate up, and its fun. Its an excellent low-impact workout and great for days when I dont have a lot of time.Like other people said, this tape will not give you a 6 pack, but there are no miracle tapes that will."
4,"Good, I was sweating!","This dvd was okay, I like the Dance Blast one better or the Bikini Body but this one was great for abs. I was sore in my legs the next day though. I just wish it didn't have mat work. It's hard for me to do proper ab moves on a mat with no spotting. It's hard to find a dvd workout for abs that are just dance moves. It was decent enough though, I was sweating!"
2,Nothing like I expected.,The DVD isn't a good abs workout or a cardio video. The section on obliques at the end is good but only a few minutes. The instructor was motivational but I didn't find the moves that creative or intense.
5,My newest favorite workout DVD,"I am a runner and I usually steer clear of workout DVDs because the instructors are always so annoying or blah. After having 2 children, my abs need some special attention and running just isn't going to cut it. I found this video on Netflix and I instantly fell in love with it. Cat is so upbeat and encouraging and cute and she just makes my workout fun! I am trying to mix it up with other workout videos and only do this one every other day, but the other ones just can't compare to this one. And after only 2-3 weeks I can really see a difference in my abs!"
2,PULLEEEEEESSS,"enough of the sappy reviews. The workout is fine for a fit 20 something college crowd. Some of the moves are interesting, but abs of this nature dont come with the workout. If you already come equipped with the tone, it will keep it that way. IF you are dieting and exercising and your metabolism has slowed down with age, stick with Tammie Webb, Kathy Smith, Pilates, Yoga or Scott Cole. The work out is boring, even for those of us that are coordinated and fit. A couple of workouts, and its pretty much a recyclable item."
3,Disappointed...,The video seemed too rushed to really work the ab areas as extensively as it could have. The standing abs were different. And the plank exercises were suitably grueling. But I think it could have been a little more intense to truly be effective.
4,Great Ab Workout For the Beginner,I found this workout enjoyable. There is a variety of different ab routines. From standing to lying on the floor. It's really easy to follow and for a person getting back into the routine of working out again I definitey feel the burn in my abs. Two things to complain about is the length and the instructor cues. It's only 30 mins. I believe to get a better workout it should have been stretched to at least 45 mins. The instructor is good at times on her cues but then starts to slack off and assumes everyone knows how to do the Mambo for se. Although after doing it several times one woudn't have to worry about the cues.
4,"Derek ""Turk"" Sanderson & the Bruins","I enjoyed this book the first & second time I read it. ""Turk"" takes you on a fun ride from his childhood to the 1970 Stanley Cup. Refreshingly candid and never dull, he doesn't mince words when talking about the Bruins or other opponents. Readers should note the chapter on his 4 categories of women. Neanderthal? You be the judge. A definite must-read book for hockey fans."
4,LOVED IT,I first bought the men's version of this jacket at the Mall. They didn't carry the women's version. I found it here and LOVE IT! I would though order a size up from your normal size. Couldn't be happier! GO BUCKS BEAT BLUE!!
3,Meh...,"I make the mistake of or downloading this thinking I could watch it on my 3D tv with my 3D glasses.Lesson learned, I could not! You gotta wear the goofy red and blue ones... All 3d glasses are goofy but the RED & Blues ones take the prize.I just don't see how you can relax looking so goofy. Anyway, I just downloaded it to test my 3d web streaming out and it was an absolute fail!Must be too new age for me? Or not new age enough, yea... thats it!"
3,The Greatest Human Being Ever Born,"...or so he seems to think. Asia Voss's review says it all, though I'd give it 3 stars and was worth the 10 bucks I paid. He does build up others but always points out he great he is. Over and over again. And he was more popular and charismatic than Bruno, Hogan, and everyone else. And the Dusty finish never had anything to do with a fake title change. And the dream card. I would have probably put Benoit in instead of Goldust. Oh, well. Read it from the library or if you can get it cheap."
1,Unfortunate,"Quite discouraging. This guy is the man I grew up with on Saturday nights watching TBS. My all time favorite wrestler, and 2nd favorite interview. I even have a Dusty Rhodes doll. However, this book is terrible. Way too many expletives that just are not needed. Terrible grammar and editing. Story line is at the same time disjointed and repetitive. Way worse than Flair's ""To Be the Man."""
2,Only buy if Dusty Rhodes is your favorite wrestler...,"This book was more about Dusty's personal life than his wrestling career. He left out a lot of details about his wrestling career, instead talking more about his wife and children. I was disappointed; there wasn't enough substance to this book...unless Dusty or Dick Murdoch are your favorite wrestlers of all time...And even still, you would be left wanting more details...One of the worst wrestling biographies I've read..."
3,Greater love hath no man.........,"Dusty is a self-promoter. That is ok, he is a wrestler and that is the name of the game, you have to promote yourself to be larger than life or you will not get anywhere.Dusty's book is full of promise but it doesn't really make the grade when it comes to delivering on the promise. He has a wealth of knowledge and stories and we see very little of it.Readable but not a classic."
1,WORST WRESTLING BOOK EVER!,"Dusty Rhodes calls himself the american dream. But I know a few billion folks who are better americans than he could ever hope to be. And they aren't obese, lisping, boring, revolting egomanics either. On a lighter note the book is very poorly written.."
1,MinnesotaWreckingCrew,"This book is not a total waste of time and money. There is some interesting material and minimal value. Overall, it is very disappointing and compares very poorly with other wrestling biographies. It is very poorly written and the style in which is it written leaves much to be desired. It is my opinion that the strongest point this work emphasizes is what a sick individual Dusty Rhodes was and is. If you are a staunch wrestling fan I do recommand reading it, but look for a copy at a thrift store or yard sale. I am sure there will be plenty of copies available soon."
1,total piece of garbage,i'll never forgive dusty for ripping me off. his book is a total waste of money. i'm trying to get some use out of the book by using it as toilet paper. his dvd sucks too.
5,Truly a dream read,"This book was one of the best wrestling books I have ever read. This isn't a book about how he ran Crockett or florida or TNA, but just a bunch of cool stories that made me long for the old days. Please do another Dusty, and let's relive the glory days"
3,DUSTY NEEDS SOME DUSTING OFF,"FIRST OFF I DID LIKE SOME OF THIS BOOK. I THINK DUSTY IS AN INTERESTING PERSON AND DOES TELL SOME GOOD STORIES. THE THINGS I DID NOT LIKE WAS HIS LACK OF DETAIL, CONTINUAL USUAGE OF THE F WORD, CONSTANT BRAGGING. I REALLY THINK HE AND MANY OF THE PEOPLE HE MENTIONS IN HIS BOOK HAVE BIG TIME DRUG AND ALCOHOL PROBLEMS WHICH HE SEEMS TO THINK IS NOT SUCH A BIG DEAL. ALOT OF PEOPLE THINK HE WAS A GREAT WRESTLER, I THINK HE WAS FAT AND OUT OF SHAPE BUT GOT AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE OF HIS WILLINGNESS TO DO WHAT IT TOOK TO BE GOOD FOR THE BUSINESS AND HIS MICROPHONE ABILITIES. I ALWAYS WONDERED WHY HE TALKED LIKE A BLACK MAN, MAYBE AN IDENTITY CRISIS. I STILL FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT A FAT, FLABBY GUY LIKE HIM COULD POSSIBLY BE BELIEVED TO BE ONE OF BEST WRESTLERS OF ALL TIME. (WHAT A JOKE) I AM NOT A FAN OF HIS, HE IS MORE LIKE AN AMERICAN CAN OF LARD WITH A BIG MOUTH AND EGO. IF YOU LIKE HIM YOU WILL PROBABLY LIKE THIS SO SO BOOK."
1,Dusty Finish,"I purchased this book looking forward to read all about Dustys great career and get insight into the great Jim Crockett era of 84-89. Instead I get Dusty blabing on and on about nothing in particular. Dusty jumps from topic to topic without ever finishing whatever thought he was on at the time.The book is in no chronological order whatsoever and if you are to believe Dusty, he was bigger than Hogan and ""Terry"" ripped him off. Oh and thanks for the chapter on the Dream Starrcade big Dust. I couldnt have lived without that. After watching his latest run as booker in TNA and reading this book, TNA will be gone by year end if you will."
4,Stardust,"Dusty is a true legend. The problem is he loves to tell you that. He talks about what a star he was in the 70's & 80's outside of wrestling, but no one knows it.He blame everyone else for his wrong doings.But their are not many who have more insight into the wrestling world than the dream. I don't think wrestling would be the same without him."
2,Dustys Dreaming,"Keeping this short and to the point.Although not even half way though it ,Dustys book is doing my head in .His shameless self promoting /name droping/ disreguard for time lines is just to much.Moving onto JJ Dillions book instead.Read it ,If you willBut have pain pills on hand"
3,Not As Advertised!,"Obviously this Hitch Mount will do the job. however, it was advertised and pictured as having the no spin design which is a great feature if you change out hitch balls. It arrived without this feature and if there is anything i hate more when buying online is getting something different from what you were expecting. Especially when you look at the pictures AND read the wording in the description. FALSE ADVERTISING!"
4,Just what the doctor ordered,"My new truck rides kinda high, and the utility trailer I bought is low profile. It looked like a ramp for the ""Duke Boys"" when I hooked it up. This drop hitch makes things much more level. Unit appears to be well made, and I plan on using it for a long time."
5,Hammel begins his quadrilogy of aerial excitement,"This is the book that sparked my interest in WW2 in the air.Hammel, an expert writer on the subject, leaves out each and every thing not essential. Consequently, the action comes through like in no other book I've read, with the possible exception of ""Top Guns"" by Foss & Brennan.The stories are short, but once one of them ends, the next one must be read right away, and the whole book is devoured at one sitting. Also included are short descriptions of the large-scale events during which the missions told take place.Buy all 4 and make your spouse angry for a week."
2,Sketches.,"This is a collection of first-person reports of dogfights against Axis fighter planes by American fighter aces, with strategy for each theater of operations and biographical material thrown in. Episodes are as repetitive and numbing as the dogfights they describe. Either the flyer got up behind the foe, fired, and watched the enemy go down, or the enemy got behind the American, who nevertheless escaped (since these aces survived to tell their story). The most interesting tale, and the longest, deals with a downed pilot escaping through enemy lines into Normandy after D-Day. Also interesting is the service records of aces after WWII. The structure and style of this book, keyed to reporting action only, make it seem heavy."
1,Sucky!,Do not buy this toy! I made the mistake of doing so and it cost me a whopping 100 dollars!!!! The picture quality was disturbingly sad. It is very blocky and I couldn't even make out the people!! The toy has very little memory [only about 30 minutes at highest quality] and it froze on me while I was recording! I was so mad I returned it as fast as I could to get my precious money back. Even though I got a value pack that included a case the toy is still now worth it! Do not buy this toy and even if you have return it now!
1,The worst toy of 2005 and 2006,I brought the vugo for my son on Christmas and it was surprising to to know that the most costful present would be the one that gave the worst face . It did not even work . When I call Hasbro the maker they tld me that I could not get a new one because there are none at the manufaturing . PLEASE DO NOT NOT BUY THIS PROUDUT IT IS JUST A DISAPOINTMENT TO SEE IN YOUR CHILDS FACE.
2,The Hasbro Scam: VUGO,"Awful product. Don't buy it.My reasons?1. The asking price for a vugo is between 100 and 150 dollars. This piece of trash only offers 128 megabytes. Do you see a problem with this? I do!Even with a memory card, which costs EXTRA MONEY,you can only extend memory 2 gigs more.2. Picture quality is terrible. Now I understand this is not a fancy expensive product, but still! You can barely make out the person's face!3. Sound quality is terrible!4. Its an entire inch thick!5. When you're in the car or outside and it's sunny, you can't see the screen.6. It froze on me several times, and after a few weeks stopped working. It may have been the batteries, or rough handeling during shipping, but I'm not so sure.I guess I'm not suprised by it's quality, considering it costs so little, but still, I do NOT thinks its worth the money. For 70 or 80 dollars more, you could get a PSP. Much better quality, and worth the money."
3,Not Worth the M.S.R.P. that's for sure,I purchased this for my daughter and was checking it out before I gave it to her.Well if you have an older computer system don'tbuy it because it won't work.The picture quality is very poor even on the best picture setting.Hasbro has alot of refining to on this one to get the M.S.R.P. of $119.99 I paid $22.00 on the net and that's about all it worth.Bottom line never gave it to my kid threw it in a drawer selling it at a garage sale.
1,waste of money,DO NOT BUY THIS!!! Both of my children recieved these for Christmas and they never worked. When we called VuGo customer service we were told WE were doing something wrong and offered no help or refund. Huge dissapointment!
1,Feel like I got scammed,I ordered this product for my 3 year old neice so that she could play games or watch videos in the car. I received it in the mail and tried to set it up and download some videos and couldn't. They provided a number to call for help and when I did I was told that Mattel no longer sold or produced this product and they no longer offer help for it. I was unable to get it working and now have a useless multimedia system.VuGo Multimedia System
3,"catchy, but predictable","The main feature is the bleepy analogue lead synth riff - a good stiff sound, with a melody that bounces across the whole octave. Otherwise it's a cheesy mix between trance and club pop, with everything happening in the places you'd predict. Her voice is ok, and it breaks things up a bit. Fairly obvious European sound. You'll love the riff, and it'll stick in your head for a few days before it finally gets annoying."
5,"Over in the Meadow, by Jane Cabrera",A great version of the classic rhyme! Illustrations are colorful and fun. Over in the Meadow is a great shared-reading book to be enjoyed over and over again!
5,Perfect for any age,"I started reading this to my infant at 3 months. The colors are amazing & kept her stimulated - along with the sing song story. Although it teaches counting to 2-4 year olds, but little one loved ""counting"" along with me. Hooray for Jane Cabrera!"
2,Too Expensive,"Tungsten is an industrial grade metal, and asking $250 for no more than 20 grams is absolutely ridiculous. WAY WAY WAY OVER PRICED."
4,Tapping into the authentic Russian Orthodox monastic legacy,"If Dostoevskii's Brothers Karamazov were rendered in chant form, if we could experience the Holy Gospels in song, if we were able to lament the Soviet's martyring of Christ's Bride in the early years of the twentieth century, . . . if any one choir could capture mourning, pious faith, and hope altogether in one offering, . . .then this would be it. This is by far the best volume that I've heard in this Anthology. The series Orthodox Shrines of the Russian North includes;The Konev Monastery, The Kirillo-Belozersk Monastery, The Solovki Monastery (Vol I), & Vol II [ renamed Vol 5 here above , 2CDs!}. This, like Dostoevskii and Icons will be mostly meaningless if you are an unbeliever!"
2,Thin picture of people seeking to be significant,"While I agree with Steffanie Gibbons' view that the Waters' memoir is well-written, in that it flows with the pen of an accomplished writer, but I cannot not agree with a rating of five stars. The ""intimate"" picture portrayed gives a thin image of his artist friends. Moreover this picture is one of, somewhat desperate, people seeking to be significant as artists, but coming off more like hangers-on. After reading the book, Taos has lost much of the well manicured luster as an artist center, and comes off more like a tourist trap."
5,:),"Claymore is absolutely amazing! It definately ranks as one of my new favorite anime series! .. ""Elfen Lied"" is still #1 though! ;)"
3,Not as good as expected.,"Kinda cliche' and corny. The lead characters traveling companion is too goody goody and over the top dramatic. This series could have been good, but it simply isn't. I thought it was going to be darker but it really is just a typical run of the mill anime."
1,"Very disappointed -- Rent it, Do not purchase!","Half of the episodes are ""night mode"" with only a 2 color palette -- black and blue. Very boring to watch - like watching an audiobook. With the exception of a few yellow eyes and sword sparks, it's very low-budget animation for half of the episodes. The first ones are good, and the last minute of the last episode is in full color, but the rest is very disappointing. The ""commentary"" for Episode 19 is just 2 chicks jabbering about nothing to do with the episode. I didn't even bother to watch the entire ""commentary"", or any of the others after checking that one out.I wasted my money on this one."
5,Great anime,"Claymore stand itself from the rest of the current anime's out there in the fact that is darker, the story is compelling girls turn into hybrid against their will, to fight monsters, the real struggle is whether they can keep their humanity during their lifetime, it is packed with good action set in the middle age.I enjoyed this anime very much it is one of my favorites.Only thing I would have like to get is a poster or more art."
4,Claymore Review,"Claymores are half-human creatures that use giant swords when hunting the blood-thirsty yoma, monstrous fiends that seek out and devour the visceral meat of human innards. As one might imagine, this is a very bloody anime, and definitely not suited for children under the age of 17. In addition to all the gory glory, all claymores are female thus, considering the MA-TV rating, a fair amount of partial nudity and occasional revealing of breasts and buttocks is present. In short, this is not a kids cartoon show... IT IS VERY ADULT!!! Parents be warned. However, if none of the above bothers you, the story and style of the anime more than make up for its unnecessary desire to flood your TV screen with nudity and gore. Another plus is the show's ardent lack of strong language, this was a big surprise as the show beautifully captures each character's emotions in dire situations. A big thumbs up on the writing.For more info and complete review:[...]"
4,Claymore,Great storyline and animation. I had never heard of this series prior but was glad I found it.
4,worth the money,"This is a good series to watch. Getting the episodes this way is much more efficient and cost-effective. I would recommend this series to anyone that enjoys medieval time settings and fantasy storylines. I believe that it is a good series for any older teenager or adult. The animation is excellent and the details are wonderful. It does tend to get a little graphic at times with the blood, but past that, truly a hidden gem that everyone should pick up."
5,Christmas gift for my nerdy wife,My Wife really liked the series. it made a great stocking stuffer. I actually watched it with her and thought it was a good story.
3,Why funimation ?,This is blu-ray ..why the Japanese Audio is Stereo 2.0 channel only ??? and the English is 5.1 TrueHD !!Thats sucks .
4,Nothing to Complain About,This came as it should have. We love this series so my husband was excited to get it. There was nothing wrong with it when it arrived and it runs fine.
5,Awesome,"Half human girls dominate killing monsters. Showing little emotion and each with different talents. As the story unfolds, it answers questions you thought you knew and then provides more questions. Their ranking system is interesting, but it gets exposed as the series progresses and the ideals about each individual character. i couldn't stop watching. Fight scenes were very well written and captured. The eye coloring was definitely different focal point versus apart of the body or the weapon. ."
4,with reservations,"I won't say much more than the many 4 and 5 star reviews except one thing. Funimation is only offering the 5.1 audio in English, as they do in many of their other releases. It seems funimation has little regard for those who prefer the original language. It's not like it would have been a huge added expense to keep the Japanese in the conversion process, and then add the dub after5. This is why I will often buy some funimation titles in the aftermarket, as Funimation seems no regard for the fan base that loves anime and appreciates the original language. I asked once about this practice and funimation replied, that to provide this service to the original language fans would be a disservice to the other fans. Go figure."
1,Old anthem,Please update it to the new National Anthem that Libya has now. As after the liberating Libya from Qaddafi this Anthem has changed
4,A cute book if you're a Disneyland fan,"This is a fun book-- the premise is, a page shows an extreme close up of something from Disneyland (for example, the crest above the castle, or the lions near the Haunted Mansion). You have to figure out what it is; turn the page to reveal a larger photo that reveals the location. Kind of neat :-)"
5,A must for all Access Developers,Very explanatory book which takes you right from intermediate level of Access Knowledge to an accomplished programmer. Full of excellent examples which you can import into your custom applications.I was so impressed that I bought the handbook for Access 95 the moment it came on bookshelves. I was so impatient to buy Handbook for Access 97 that I emailed Paul Litwin in Jan 97 to ask when was his new book coming. I regard Getz as my guru
1,music critic,"bianca was a AGT winner 2 years ago, havent heard from her since, not surprising with material like this, she tends to ""shout"" most of the song, not recomended"
4,excellent garden tool,"I couldn't decide between the Black and Decker cultivator and this one... I actually needed two... one for me and one for my ""hired hand. This, too, was ""perfect tool for those of you who need to weed/ cultivate small tight areas of the garden and spare the bending over that so often causes back pain. A great product at a great price... with great results. You can't go wrong with either, but if you pressed me into choosing one, I think I liked the Black and Decker better for being a bit more ergonomic and overall design."
4,Words that Moved a Nation,"Product Description:""The American Reader is a stirring and memorable anthology that captures the many facets of American culture and history in prose and verse. The 200 poems, speeches, songs, essays, letters, and documents were chosen both for their readability and for their significance. These are the words that have inspired, enraged, delighted, chastened, and comforted Americans in days gone by. Gathered here are the writings that illuminate -- with wit, eloquence, and sometimes sharp words -- significant aspects of national conciousness. They reflect the part that all Americans -- black and white, native born and immigrant, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American, poor and wealthy -- have played in creating the nation's character."""
3,Not for muzzy mx3,"Beware this is now for the muzzy mx3 3 blade but instead the regular muzzy 3 blade, it was my mistake while purchasing just letting other buyers know to beware of it aswell"
4,For Those Who Enjoyed the Book,"We watched this movie one night, the entire family having read the book. The ""city"" itself was worth the view (what a concept!), and the details were wonderful, i.e. repaired clothes and electrical tape EVERYWHERE. The casting was adequate, Bill Murray making a particularly fine mayor. Ok, so the screenplay didn't exactly follow the book, but still was close enough to satisfy fans. Worth a watch."
5,Good fun,"This movie has a good storyline that they built on well. They chose a lighter approach to keep it fun for the whole family. It could have been done differently, but stills does an outstanding job at watchability. If you have kids between 8-14, pop some popcorn and put this movie in your dvd player. Guaranteed to have a good time."
3,good film,"i really like this film , its a bit dark in the lighting but hence the city of ember. Some nice adult actors and a nice story, makes you wonder if it could happen in the future !"
3,Not as good as the book.,I read this book series and it was excellent. Of course as soon as I found out there was a movie I had to see it. And of course the movie is not as good as the book but it was still worth watching.
5,An underacheiving great film,"This movie did quite poorly in the theatres. It never got very high in the rankings, and left the theatres soon after it got there.Yet the initial reviews were good, and so I bought it. Didn't look at it for over a year, but sat down tonight and thought it was a pleasant night's 5-star entertainment -- about 90 minutes of movie.Others have described the plot, I'll try my hand at it. Something happens on earth, a global war or cataclysm, or something. So some people build a city far underground, built to last for 200 years, which is the length of time that the earth's surface will take to be livable again. They start a timer so people will know when to come back to the earth's surface. But things go ""terribly wrong"", the timer is lost, and the city systems (electricity, water, food) start deteriorating. Nobody will survive unless...Well, THAT's why you need to see the movie. Four 1/2 stars, but I bumped it to 5 because of good special effects."
3,City under the ground,"Lots of unanswered questions, but it is a good movie for the family. At least it gives everyone something to talk about later."
3,"Very Entertaining, Great For Families",I saw this movie a few years back and I couldn't remember the title but after some research I found it and had to add it to my collection. If you like puzzles and mystery this is a must have I really enjoyed trying to piece clues together and this movies has many clues to it's story.
3,I loved the premise...,"This was slightly a let down. It was kinda predictable and the graphics were quite low for the time it was made. I will give them credit for the few things they did do right, which were two animals that they CG'd and were done decently."
4,Interesting movie.,It's an interesting movie. It's like an adventure movie. I would suggest it to be view by someone who isn't startle by a small scary scene. But overall it's clean and have a good storyline. It kind of keep you on your toes wondering what's going to happened next.
5,excellent movie!,Rented this for my students to watch and they loved it. It was a great resources in teaching literary elements.
2,Disappointing,"After seeing Saoirse Ronan's performance in Atonement, I was disappointed to see how shallow her acting can be. None of the characters are multi-dimensional and the plot is very straight-forward, a little outlandish, and predictable. A good adventure movie for young kids though."
1,WORST MOVIE EVER!,"My friend told me this was going to be a good movie.. what a b.s. lie. i should of walked out and went into a different movie. This movie was so pointless, waste of my time, waste of money, and a waste of film.."
1,bad and awful,"My firm opinion on this book is that it is flat out terrible! It is an insult to the book, the author and movies in general! The acting is poor and the actors do not do a good job of portraying the story AT ALL! The viewer is left in complete confusion throughout the entire movie, ESPECIALLY if they are not familiar with the story! For all those who are thinking of purchasing this movie it is NOT, I repeat NOT, worth your money! And if it is for some reason not costing you any money, than it is not worth the time you will spend viewing it! If you are still interested in this movie, i recomend borrowing the books from the library! Though the books are no masterpiece they are much better than the movie and reading them will save you the money you were planning to spend on this!! I firmly recomend purchasing ANYTHING else!!!"
3,Good Movie...Better Book...Better than other movies out there!,"This movie is a 5 stars compared to anything High School Musical, Hannah Montana will have to offer. The City of Ember's major flaw was the fact that it was terribly rushed. Unlike the book. I felt less sadness, felt less fear, and felt less triumphance at the end. The mayor was poorly portrayed, the innocence and trust of the people were barely registerable. I wish those aspects had been more astutely communicated.There wasn't a whole lot of win in the end, not like how the book had built you up and up and up for the final approach to the world above. Too bad, but still this movie has a better premise than anything HM or the other HM from disney can give you. I suggest reading the books however. I have a feeling there was way too much editing on this movie and I have a sneaking suspicion something had to do with budget.Good luck..."
2,City of Ember,"I was sent the European version. I returned it, asked for them to replace it and instead they are sending me a rebate card. Very disappointed and still haven't received the rebate."
3,Not as Good as the Book,"After reading the City of Ember book I watched this movie. The movie had so many things removed from the story that is in the book. There were things in the movie that just didn't make sense (e.g. why was there a control tower with many controls when all it was designed for was to reveal the exit?).The mutated creatures were cheesy.I may not have enjoyed the movie now, but I remember when it first was released I watched it and enjoyed it (when I was 14 years old). I didn't remember much of it so I read the book then wanted to watch the movie again. The movie is designed for children. The book is a ""children's book"", but as a teen who doesn't read may books I did enjoy it."
3,OKay - not as good as book,"This is an entertaining movie - characters are fine and acting is decent. We read the book first and where interested in the movie but... not nearly as good as the book. The movie changed the story line enough that it was difficult to follow at times. The book was much more clear about the letter and had a true mystery to unravel.The movie - interesting, not great."
3,Mediocre--had a lot of potential--Book is Better,"We watched this because we really liked the book. The movie had a lot of potential--and had Bill Murray and Tim Robbins. It's almost like the good movie it could have been is hidden away in there. The crisis starts immediately--how about a little build up of the normal life in Ember? And what's with all the high techie stuff they added to the movie in order to be able to find the way out? The book had a simpler more plausible (OK not really plausible but at least more so) discovery line. It's like someone decided they better add some giant slugs/mollusks and a big tidal wave to spice up the action quota. What a shame. I wondered why I never heard of it coming out in theaters. Anyway, we watched it all and it was perfectly appropriate for the age 7-10 crowd. Too bad, this book could've made a great movie with this scenery and these actors."
3,Good but not great,The story is an interesting story but the outfits and props are low budget and cornet. The book was way better.
4,Very surprised by how entertaining it was,"I'm a 40-year old adult with serious movie tastes. I watched this with my 8 and 13-year old kids and was completely surprised by how entertaining it was. I have seen many movies with them that were total CHEESE... I mean cheese. They like it but the movie was just awful. But, this movie was not one of those. It was quite good and had good child acting. There have been so many lousy ""kids"" movies that performed well at the box office and I don't understand how this decent movie flopped...?"
5,"Fun, Adventurous, and best of all... TOTALLY CLEAN!",We are very picky when it comes to movies. We like modesty in our movies too. This movie is remarkably clean and it is still adventurous! What a find! Great family movie!
2,Couldn't get into this one.,"Neither I nor my children could get past the first 15 minutes of this one. Although the young girl was adorable and precocious, she wasn't enough to carry the movie alone. It was dismal. The storyline wasn't strong. The idea seemed intriguing, however, the final product missed the mark. Skip this one."
4,City of Ember DVD,My Grandson had read the book and had asked me to look for the DVD. Luckily I found it on Amazon.He was tickled that I bought it. We watched it together and it was pretty good. Than he took it home so he could watch it with his Mom & Dad.
4,City of Ember-,I enjoyed the storyline. Exciting and fun. I hope the rest of the books in this series are made into movies. Good movie for a rainy day.Kids will really enjoy the mystery and adventure.
1,"Will not play on US players, Pay Attention! BluRay disc is Region B!",Bought this for my daughter for Christmas to play on our brand new Sony 3D BluRay player. Surprise disc is encoded for Region B which will not play on most players in North America - Great! Amazon please make sure seller specifies clearly that it is a Region B disc!
4,city...,A very good movie. It is a very clean with an interesting story line. I really enjoyed it. It isn't flashy and full of bullets flying. It is based on a book so if you read the book first then you will have a bit more of the details that should have been filled in during the movie.An underground city's only source of electricity is expiring. Two particular young people figure out some clues that should have been given to each generation but was forgotten. The clues are really important in order to save their city.
4,Good watch,This was a good movie for kids & adults. I enjoyed it. It had some comedy & some drama and lots of mystique.
3,"good, but not at all like the book","I liked this movie, and thought that is was a good one, but it is NOT AT ALL like the book. I know that usually when there is a movie based on a book, it is usually slightly different than the book, but not like this. The movie is completely different than the book. I do like this movie, and I think that others may like it too, but it sort of a letdown to see how much it isn't like the book."
4,Incomplete plot left me wondering,"I suppose the books are better are they are a series and contain more info, though I'm one who prefers to watch fantasy stories instead of reading them. Wish I knew the background history as far as why the city was created (the danger for mankind); also, about the mayor, the man who came from the tunnel, and Dune's father's attempts to escape. It's as if you are suddenly thrown into the plot, and while richly done, it left me with questions. Here's hoping there will be a sequel (and/or prequel)."
1,Wish it worked as good as it looks.,"I purchased this as a gift for my wife. It showed up, it looks great, and a few days after it arrived, before I had a chance to give it to her, it stopped working. I am less than impressed."
5,"A wonderful, moving book about ""fitting in.""","I stumbled across this book when I was in late high school, and liked it so much that I checked it out of the library to read to my mother. This book spoke especially strongly to my experience of growing up Jewish in the midwest, but I think any child who's felt like an outsider (which is to say, any child) could identify with Molly's experiences."
3,Molly's Pilgrim,"The book ""Molly's Pilgrim"" by Barbara Cohen is about a girl named Molly. It is her first Thanksgiving and she founds out that she really doesn't have anything to be thankful for. Her classmates really make fun of her because of her unfamiliarity with American ways.Then when it comes to doing a project Molly gets embarassed because her mom helps with the project. She helps by making a little doll that looked more like a Russian girl than a pilgrim. But she explains thatthe doll her mom did was because she tried to explain that her mom is a pilgrim because she came for freedom to worshiip god as her own way."
1,Superficial treatment of a complex subject.,Don't waste your time or money with this book. A superficial treatment of a complex subject. Book is filled with technical inaccuracies.
1,Don't waste your time or money on this book!,"Like so many of the others, this author tries to explain a highly technical subject to non-technical folks and fails in the attempt. The book is filled with technical inaccuracies and leaves the non-technical reader scratching their head after reading a chapter. It's almost as if Ms. Van Tassel had this stuff explained to her by a technical person that either didn't want to take the time to do it right or didn't know the subject."
2,ok,"I'm a professional Massage Therapist and Reflexologist and I'm always looking for new resources for my students. This is a very pretty chart, but it's got some very unusual aspects on the hands I've never seen before and are not commonly accepted. Someone came up with their own chart there. Some of the foot anatomy is a bit off too. Skip this one and go for another like the Rainbow chart or Quick guide one."
3,Its good but no easy to install,"Great product, once its set it work perfectly, it releases the arrow straight and true every time, it just took about an hour of fiddling to dial it in, it doesn't come with instructions, so you just have to figure it out...."
3,Arrow Rest RH,"The product was alright at best; the rubber covers wrapped around the A.rest kept effecting the arrows when it was drawn, making the arrows pop out of place and having to manually re-insert them almost every time. In the end I just went back to using the original arrow rest that came with the bow."
1,cheap junk,this is the biggest peice of crap.the spring on the unit is made of none spring metal and lost tention right away. buy another arrow rest.allen company sells toy quality stuff not made to stand up to any stress of use.
1,Poor quality,This rest has lots of play in the cam/ axle the prongs are sticky and the spring is garbage. I find it hard that this rest would produce reproducible accuracy. I tried to return it and got poor customer service as well. Do not buy this product if you tune your own equipment. My dealer said he would not sell such an inferior product!
1,Don't buy this product unless you are looking for shredded coconut,"The description of this product is disceptive. This product was represented as a powder, but it is not a powder, it's a granule. It is nothing more than shredded coconut and doesn't even dissolve in a high speed commercial blender.Unless you are using this product to manufacture a dark chocolate-coated coconut patty, to me it is useless. My intention was to use it as an additive in a healthy shake. It ended up ruining the shake as I had to resort to chewing the undissolved, tasteless coconut pieces rather than drinking the shake.Additionally, the way the product was packaged, there was no protective cardboard preventing the slashing the top package when the box was opened.If I could have rated this product zero stars, I would have. The only redeeming quality was that it was rather inexpensive. I gave one package away for FREE to a patient who loves coconut and she gave it back to me two days later complaining that it was terrible!"
2,Needs to be sturdier,"For the first few weeks this headset was fine for morning workouts. Good sound, comfortable fit, relatively easy to use. I've had it about six months and the flaws in the design are becoming evident and annoying. The little metal parts like the screws have corroded, the set gets stuck on a single channel -- not the one I want -- and it's impossible to change, it goes through batteries way too quickly, and sometimes it just doesn't work. The channel settings are lost when you change batteries, so I stopped using that feature after the second battery swap-out. The low-battery indicator light always seems to be on no matter how fresh the batteries are. As new as my unit is, I feel like it's on its last legs. This said, if the company came out with a much better version of the same product I would buy it because the basic concept is strong."
2,Great unit until it broke.,"I bought this GPX unit looking for a ..., digital radio to use while jogging. The good news is that the radio worked well, the unit stays on your head well while jogging, and even though build construction wasn't great I was happy given the low price.After three months the AM radio stopped working. I still use it on FM stations, but I wish I had spent a few extra dollars and bought the Koss headphone radio. I had a Koss model that lasted for 5+ years through all sorts of abuse."
1,Hard to use no support,Whatever you do please stay away from this terrible piece of software. There is no longer support on it any longer as the company has closed up shop.The product is extremely difficult to use and very cumbersome. The only reason to buy this kit is to get the firewire card that is included for your laptop.The software is no good.
2,okay dvd,"I wanted to try this dvd cause I thought it would be a good DVD. But, to tell the truth I was really disappointed and I love Rania's dvd's. I figured it would be better. I didn't get much out of it at all."
5,Husband's FAVORITE candy bar,"My husband grew up in upstate NY near Montreal, Quebec. He loves this candy bar and it is not sold in the US. I ordered him 30 bars and he eats one almost daily."
5,deelish!,Bought these for my husband's birthday to remind him of his childhood in Canada. I enjoyed them too.Can't wait to order some more.
5,Great for homeschool art or any art appreciation,Beautiful cards!Pros:Printed on nice strong card stockName of artist and title printed on the back of each card.Nice clear picturesGood to use as flashcards.Cons:I wish there were more pictures.My children always enjoyed looking at these types of cards.
5,I Wish,"The book mirrors every baby boomers recollections of their parents that survived a depression and fought a world war. The greatest generation maybe overblown and tainted with perspective problems; however, there is no recent generation that survived, prospered and ultimately found a way back home to prosperity and family. It is a universal struggle of many and makes one feel guilty of not recording their own history.It is well written and the dry wit of Lt. Gatewood survives the text. The book is not overblown with sentimentality or emotional gaffs. It is not flowery and the dialogue matches Lt. Gatewoods war time profession. Straightforward, concise and precise are words that come to mind.This book should have multiple audiences---from that baby boomer recollecting their parents, to the young reader in school trying to grasp the realities of what that generation endured."
4,"Loving, friendly, honest - a very pleasant read!","Karen leads her readers through those preschool years with wonder, humor and insight, making the journey from pastor's wife to pastor's wife with precocious little girl a joy to follow. Her encounters with Molly, from ""Molly Bug"" to ""Molly, Big Sister Ready to Face the World,"" challenge Karen to grow in her own faith and relationship with God. This book reminds us all to open our hearts and minds to the daily lessons and gifts we all find tucked into the corners of our lives."
3,Dramatic audio is the only way to listen to a book,This whole series was well done and used lots of the same actors so following the story was easy. This particular book seemed rushed and was done simply to wrap the story up and not leave any loose ends. Not what I had come to expect after the others but still not bad.
3,"""soup"" bowl is WAY too small.","While the dishes and mugs are fine, the cereal/soup bowls are far too shallow to hold either. Don't know how on earth you're supposed to fill them with a normal portion of food!Also disappointed in all of the warnings that accompanied our Watercolors dishes. They are far more fragile than the ads led me to believe.May not keep the 12 place settings which just arrived today."
1,All the same!,"This guy may have some talent, but he needs to realize that all of his pieces sound the same! Somebody needs to tell him that there needs to be some variety between his tracks. I purchased this CD because I am a follower of Todd Turkisher and Bruce Rogers, and therefore are on the CD. They should not associate with him."
4,Nice but not sturdy,"This is my favorite gardening tools. However, the head broke off when I tried to clear a large patch of crab crass with it. I will get another. It is great for picking up fallen fruit."
2,not terribly strong,Maybe I was just using it wrong but I managed to snap the entire head off of mine while prying out a stubborn rock from my lawn. It was however a great tool until then.
1,Great tool if they send the one you ask for!,In the picture you see what I ordered. I already have one of these and it's an awesome tool. That's why I ordered two of the same. Instead I got what I suppose is the new version in green. The blades are not the same! I would not order it again.
1,Waaay toooo small. worthless,This could be only possibly useful for very very light work (in which case you might as well get a little 3-prong curved for $2-4 at your nearest store). The only positive is the handle which is sturdy and may be reused for another purpose or to attach a different tool.
3,"Very Useful Tool, Nice Function, Bad Construction","This is our favourite gardening tool. The handle has a nice plastic grip, and the extension makes it functional at various lengths. The head of the tool is welded to the extendable length of the handle, and it is this part that is the Achilles heel. The gauge of steel used is inadequate, and just a little too much leverage on the tool causes the head rips off.I really hope Corona fixes this problem because this is really a great tool otherwise."
3,Extremely dated,"This DVD looks like a run off of the old VHS tape by the same name. Very dated, looked like mid 80's to me."
3,Not for beginners,"You have to be familiar with yoga poses in order to do this workout, as no instruction is offered. It is a fast-paced yoga based workout that I enjoyed, but I found the music really annoying."
4,from a yoga dummy,I am enjoying this workout. I feel that I have exercised when I am through but I don't hurt.
3,lost weight?,"Is there anyone who can review this and say that they lost weight? there are lots of yoga dvd's available. I did yoga for years, even taught beginners, but I never lost weight. I'm older now and want something restorative to complement the cardio and weight work I do, but I want to continue to lose weight. Does this really help with weight loss or is it just about feeling energized or relaxed?"
4,I'm Addicted to this DVD,"I have never done any type of yoga before, and I am no gym junkie either, but I did not find this workout too hard to follow...just don't expect to completely hang with it at first - you have to get to where you know what's coming next, and some parts will always be easier than others. Challenging, yes, but just enough. I like the pace and it really does get your heart rate up. Chris is a bit of cheesy robot but I like her. Great routine!"
3,not for beginners,"As a person who is not experienced at doing yoga, I found the dvd hard to follow. It is fast paced and I would recommend watching it first before doing it. On the other hand, I'm sure once I learn the routine, it will be a fun and effective workout.The problem is, there is no beginners routine. Also it would have helped if she showed how to do the pose first, then had you do it. Overall, the instuctor is motivational. Just found it hard to keep up with pace first time around, and had to skip second phase because I am out of shape. I will however continue to try and write a new review after I start to see results."
1,Don't bother.,I got this DVD for only $9.99 and good thing too because if I had paid anymore I'd be pretty upset. The DVD isn't as easy to follow as it claims. Perhaps it might be easy to follow for someone at a higher level of experience but not for beginners. On top of that the way Chris Freytag grins through out the entire workout is reminiscent of a robot.
3,"Short, Solid Cardio Yoga Workout","A solid short cardio yoga workout. This is one of the first yoga routines I did regularly and I found it easy to follow and just challenging enough to get me sweating, with lots of repetition and a fast-moving flow. The ""for dummies"" add-ons, like the little pop-up reminders, get annoying after doing the DVD a few times, but that happens with a lot of DVDs I guess. If you are new to yoga, I recommend a slower hatha-based flow to start, or read a couple yoga books before starting this quick series. The cool down is a little short, and there's no corpse pose at the end."
2,Eye Opening,"I ordered this book because I assumed it would be accounts of murders and how/if they were captured. I was looking forward to the text by Katerine Dunn, but much to my dissapointment there was none to speak of. Being an avid true crime and forensic reader, I was shocked when I looked through the book. I knew there would be pictures, but MAN...that's all there was. It reminded me of Faces of Death. Not my thing, but if your into that than this book is for you.I would recommend for you true crime lovers to pass on this book. I for one can do without seeing brains and parts of skull spread about someones front porch."
5,"morbid,twisted,true","this book is one of the best books i have ever seen on the market especialy if you want the sickest most morbid collection of pictures including, but not limited to suicides car wrecks,murders and even a section of dead babys and children my favorite is the one where a mom smacked her kids in the head with a hammer or the one with the infants head cut off by a meat cleaver..... but enough about that if you are sickend by this reveiw than dont get this book it is morbid, twisted but most importantly of all true!!!!!"
1,Ignorance.,"This book had very little in the way of background stories of the cases. There were brief explanations, at best, and sometimes nothing. I feel like the person who compiled this was a bigot and got some type of kick out of photos of what he called ""faggots"" and especially the hermaphrodites. It's shameful."
4,There were no good old days,"Jack Huddleston was a homicide detective for the Los Angeles Police Department from the 20's to the 50's. He collected his photos in a scrapbook now published by Feral House, and it makes for grim reading.His career started with Prohibition (and the wonderful crimes that it caused) and continued with investigations of all kinds: murders, suicides, car accidents, and even babies killed by poor desperate mothers. In LA there were no good old days.These pictures are not for the squeamish. They do, however, reflect the values of the society in LA at the time. Immigrants from all over were rushing to seek their fortunes (and misfortunes) in a society that worships success and scorns failure. The criminal gangs and the suicides were two sides of the same coin."
3,Disturbing and provacative,"I admit I bought this book out of a sense of curiosity more than anything else. What I got was the printed equivalent of a nasty car accident - you know it's going to give you nightmares but you just have to slow down and look anyway. I gave this book three stars beause I can't honestly say I ""enjoyed"" it, but I was very unsettled by it. Warning - there are several pictures here of murdered infants and children; wish I had known this in advance, as I am pregnant and I can't get those painful images out of my mind.If you want the unglossed truth about what violent death looks like, this is the book to buy. It doesn't need to be in color to be graphic - the b&w is detailed enough. Good documentation, but with too much emphasis on the shock value."
3,Not for kids,The real photos that the old paper would put in the paper to scare people and lower crimes -- Not for weak-hearted
5,Much more interesting when you read the intro,"This book is fascinating simply in it's origins. That sets it apart.After I read this book for the first time, I found The Trunk Murderess: Winnie Ruth Judd by Jana Bommersbach at the library. It was so good I purchased it on Amazon...but the updated copy. (buy that one)It's about a woman made infamous for supposedly murdering two women, chopping up one, putting the pieces into two trunks and shipping them. It was the pieces-parts angle and her beauty that captured the headlines and got her a horribly long sentence...even though she was almost certainly innocent.Imagine my surprise when I re-read Death Scenes last night and found several autopsy photos of the dismembered victim, Sammy Samuelson. It was very sad. Trunk Murderess is highly reccomended."
5,For all Morbid people like ME!,"This book is perhaps the most honest and morbid book in the market today,I had to order it here because my local bookstore would not order it for me!The text is an interesting essay on how this woman has viewed the purpose of the book.I am not here to tell you what the purpose is,but I will tell you this:It is good for the morbid part of you.(But never take it to school,I got mine taken away for two weeks before I got it back)"
4,Not for the Squeamish,"Jack Huddleston was a homicide detective for the Los Angeles Police Department from the 20's to the 50's. He collected his photos in a scrapbook now published by Feral House, and it makes for grim reading.His career started with Prohibition (and the wonderful crimes that it caused) and continued with investigations of all kinds: murders, suicides, car accidents, and even babies killed by poor desperate mothers.

Immigrants from all over were rushing to seek their fortunes (and misfortunes) in a society that worships success and scorns failure. The criminal gangs and the suicides were two sides of the same coin."
4,Not for the faint-of-heart,"What can you write about a book you liked that also made you nauseous?Being a morbid individual since I was little (my teachers used to send notes home, asking if I was always so fascinated by death), I was thrilled when I found this book, and looked forward to looking through it.The photos were fascinating, but invoked in me the same feeling I used to have before Anatomy lab -- the feeling of ""I can take it -- I can take it"".I can't take it.I have an even greater respect now for people who have to deal with this as a function of their job. I think they're underpaid.After finishing the book, I felt I had to undergo therapy and/or be sedated."
1,Badly Designed,"The engineer who designed the air flow physics of this thing should be fired.It has a standard large fan located under the hard drive you install in it. In comparison to most other enclosures, instead of blowing air on your drive to keep it cool, the fan rotates in reverse, allowing the hard drive to heat up, and then attempts to pull the heat away through ineffectively small exhaust vents on the sides.The end result is that this enclosure TRAPS most of the heat, causing both your hard drive and the enclosure to get hotter and hotter. If you want to cook your hard drive and shorten it's life in this thing, well, it's a free country.Be intelligent. Shop further for a better product.I recommend the Thermaltake N0012USU Max 4 Active Cooling 3.5-Inch USB 2.0 eSATA Hard Drive Enclosure. Amazon currently sells this."
2,meh.,"i like all three songs. it's an okay single, i guess, but it seemed like zwan half-*ssed this single by not bothering to include studio tracks. both of the b-sides are live recordings from the hideout shows.....it just would have been nice for them to put a little more effort into a single, and give the fans something we didn't already have."
3,Almost like the old days,"UK import on Martha's Music/Reprise/Warner Music UK Ltd. The non-LP tracks are the Bob Dylan cover ""Nobody 'Cept You"", sung by David Pajo, the James Iha of Zwan if you like, and ""Autumn Leaves"" is one of those songs your grandparents would know (like the Pumpkins cover of ""My Blue Heaven"")! After this single, they had their Zwan song (Zwan is Dutch/Nederlandse for swan)."
3,Rare but not so good,"This England import is for the real fans of Zwan and Smashing Pumpkins. It has 2 live songs that are acousticly performed, one by David Pajo and the other by Billy Corgan. They aren't that good but I like the fact that I have a rare Zwan single and those 2 acoustic songs.Overall I give it a 3 out of 5, like I said it's for a true fan of Zwan and The Pumpkins"
4,Could have been better,"I was delighted to finally find a concordance for my elementary age children. I love the idea of being able to teach my children how to search the Scriptures for themselves for GOD's truths. It is easy to use and understand. In addition to the places listed where the word occurs, there is also a short definition of the word which is helpful. The print is big enough, and I like how they also included the phonetic spelling. I do not, however, like how much wasted space there is. Each six inch wide page has a two inch wide gray colored column going down the side. That column offers no information; it is just wasted. Occasionally, there may be a small B&W illustration in that area. There are six maps in the back of the book. Keep in mind that this book is for children and is NOT a complete concordance. There are just a sampling of the occurences of each word."
5,Hot Shit,"This dude is the next nigga out of houston. He's on his way to the top. perios. Solid album, solid beats, his stlye his like a southern jay-z and 50 cent on one. This dude is no sleep on."
1,FOR Canon EOS to FD lens mount adapter digital,"Arrived on time. The product was returned back since it did not fit and work with my 135mm Canon FD lens. As such, I do not have a positive influence on this product or comments."
3,Canon lens adapaterr,"The adapter is ok, it's a little time consuming to attach a lens, and some lens brands just don't work, ie a zoom Tamron lens just wouldn't fit"
1,expensive!!!!!,"this is a great product, but it is priced way too high here! You can purchase it many places for 5-8 dollars. Don't buy it here!!!"
3,"Best lip balm, worst container.","This is the best lip balm ever made. It is non-greasy, has no flavor, keeps lips moist for hours and gives a great shine that even seems to enhance the color of lips. But the tube is the worst design ever. The tip is not an applicator tip so you either have to use your finger (gross) or rub the rough end over your lips. After you use about half of the tube it becomes a struggle to get any out, like a toothpaste tube. When you're down to 25% left you smoosh it to the top of the tube, trying to get out enough to put on your lips. After struggling for a while to get some out it all comes spewing out the top, all over your hands, wasting about 50 cents worth of product each time. It's so frustrating that I buy 2-3 different lip balms a month just trying to find one that works as well but is in a different container.Please Kiehl's you have got to make a better container for this awesome product."
3,Just OK for me.,"Wolfgang Baur and Zeb Cook produced some mindblowing stuff with TSR and 2e so I was expecting some of that to come across with this. Not really what I expected. The assassin core class that's offered is really kinda ""meh"". I've used a stripped down 3e rogue with the prc assassin powers every few levels but sans the spellcasting. It's better than this one by far. The guild info is pretty good though, so it's not a total waste.I really was expecting a stellar core assassin class with four or five outstanding prcs but I was pretty disappointed. Baur and Cook are better than this!"
5,Works well for toy cats too!,"Was looking for a country-style cat bed for a little girl to keep all her furreal friends in. Has worked very well. Helps keep the ""babies"" tidy and off the floor. The bed itself is gorgeous. Could not find anything near as nice to look at in the local stores. Appears it would be rather comfy for real cats too."
1,"Quality Writing, Horrible Binding","I have zero complaints about the content. It was a useful, concise, well written textbook. That being said, in a class of 20 students, every single copy of this poorly glued disaster fell apart before the end of the semester. At this price, the quality of this book is near criminal. I have emailed the publisher and received zero response.If you really need this book for a class, the introductory version is properly bound (or look for an alternate source). If you are teaching this class PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE look elsewhere."
3,needs more examples,"There is a ton of information in this book, and the information flow from section to section is pretty decent, but I wish there were more examples or more thorough examples. I'm the kind of learner that needs to see things worked through to get a good grip on it. The book does this sometimes, but in many of the more complex examples (when really needed) the explanations and visual representations are often quite slim. In most cases, it would take an entire page or two to show the beginning information, the steps between, and the final result, but I would rather have a thicker book that I understood more thoroughly."
1,paper back is worthless,"buy the hard cover!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the paperback is falling apart only after one months use. I'm not even kidding. I bought it brand new too. What a waste of money. The hard cover isn't as thick (and has the same material...don't ask me how). The paper back also comes in 2 annoying editions as opposed to one.The material is probably the same as any other DB book, its good and explains everything well.but remember.......BUY THE HARD COVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!! YOU'LL THANK ME L8R...well if u never had the pleasure of the paper back i guess u wont but w.e"
4,"Awsome Dexter Gordon album, but lousy sound quality","Nice tunes, but why did they have to destroy the sound quality by running the master into a cheap PC noise reduction system and then claim that it is a better sounding 20 bit release?I've been looking for ages for the older CD release of it that is not tampered with like this release is."
1,Way too bright,The clock is basically a blue night light. The first morning after using it I checked the manual and was happy to see there is a dimmer. Too bad it was already set to low. I tried living with it for 2 weeks but every night I ended up facing the clock away from my bed due to the brightness. I've since switched back to my old alarm which doesn't display all the numbers correctly BUT it doesn't light my bedroom blue...
1,Do not bother!,"This alarm lights up my entire room at night with a very annoying blue light. I've had to put it under my bed every night, but I can still see the glow. I've tried to dim it, but that's as dark as it gets. The radio is horrible, although you can program multiple channels, the reception is so aweful that they barely work. And when the radio is on, the display turns to the station number, and you can't set it to show the time. Also, it's difficult to see the display unless you're right in front of it, even though it's bright. I had to switch to my old alarm, at least it works."
2,worth what you pay for it,"If you're looking for a ultra cheap clock radio with abysmal sound quality from the radio..this is it. Wasn't expecting Bose quality, but still. The most annoying feature is the blue backlight. I have to throw a towel over it just to get to sleep."
2,"Not much annoying A&C schtick, but not much to redeem it either...","I bought this expecting (based on reviews) something more...Granted, the usual irritating mannerisms weren't plentiful - but there was still plenty of, ""Why, you..."" and fist shaking.This movie most notably lacked a good script. It took some good ideas (the Jack story is embedded in a modern-day tale of babysitting for a bratty little kid, some potentially charming embellishments on the fairy tale itself), but the writing (this thing must have been churned out in a week or two) didn't do anything with them. The songwriting and choreography are similarly uninspired.The other thing that wasn't there was quality acting/directing (for example, the giant spends most of his time standing around looking threatening).My sons (4 and 5) are big movie fans, and will sit and watch almost anything - they lost interest in this within a few minutes. I made the mistake of continuing to watch, waiting for something good to happen. It never did."
4,Very enjoyable,"Definitely above average. It is listed as a paranormal romance, but this isn't what I consider paranormal. It is more alternate reality, or even sci-fi rom. The plot development was good, the pacing better than average, and the character development solid. I loved the intersecting (parallel) time lines. What could have been an overworked storyline was used quite effectively. Plus the romance was wonderful. Overall a very enjoyable read and I look forward to the next in the series."
4,Very enjoyable!,"Kelsey Wells, geologist, meets Jared Bennett, the Refarian alien king in Yellowstone when they are both teenagers. They spend time together on earth before Jared's mentor, who wipes the memory of their meeting from their minds, takes him back. Years later they meet again and thus ensues a romance and adventure.I thought this science fiction romance had a beautiful love story. We actually see more of Jared's character as a great deal of the book is from his viewpoint. I agree with one of the reviewers that this book does not really take off until the middle and once it does, it throws a completely new spin on the action. It took me quite by surprise after the first of the book deals mainly with their growing relationship. There were some very touching scenes that made me cry. The love scenes were beautiful. I absolutely enjoyed this book and will definitely read the others in this new Novel of Midnight Warriors series."
2,I couldn't get into this book,"I love paranormal romance novels and I'm generally pretty willing to try new authors. But I just couldn't get into this one. There is nothing specifically wrong with the writing, just wasn't interesting. The characters were flat and not worth the effort. The plot also didn't seemed to be going anywhere anytime soon. The closest I can come in the way of an explanation would be that the author is basically painting by the numbers, all the right elements are there but there's no spark. The book is nothing spectacular, but also not terribly bad either. Me, I don't like luke-warm reading so I put it down."
1,Parallel Dysfunction,The story and characters started out interesting but then everything went to heck in a handbasket. The storyline became confused and uninteresting. The characters were immature and clueless. I didn't bother finishing this book.I will not be reading anything further by this author.
3,Great-looking!,"Looks aren't everything, though...this is a beautiful hammock, but a single person using it is just engulfed in it as it folds up with their body weight! No crossbars on the ends to keep the hammock open, which makes it difficult to use at best. We're novice hammock users, so don't know if there's a trick to this or not. If there is, we haven't yet figured it out."
2,wish they had told me the size earlier,The size was never put on the site before I bought it. If you read the reviews and your looking for the size its about 4x7 feet. good material just not for me
2,Wrong size,"Since the size of the cover was not included in the description, it did not fit and had to be returned."
1,No Size in the ad !,"If the size (i.e. what model it fits) is not included in the ad, I'd never buy this. Shipping stuff back and forth is not THAT much fun."
5,Gymtough flex mat,"Not many reviews available when I was shopping for a mat so I just picked a mid-price range mat. I have an elliptcal on the mat over a laminated floor. This mat is very adequate for this purposes. I also have a bow flex mat that came free with the bow flex and the Gymtough mat is better and cheaper to buy outright ($49 vs. the $99 advertised price for the bow flex mat).The only down side, this mat had a very bad odor which lasted for over a month. I put it outside for a day when I got it but I would recommend unpackaging it and leaving it outside to air out for at least a week when you get. Anyway this is a problem that will go away in time."
5,Tough!,This product is easy to use and keeps my elliptical from making scratches or impressions on my hard wood floor. Also keeps it from slipping. Highly recommended.
5,X-MAS IN 1969,AT THE EARLY AGE OF 6 I RECIEVED MY DANNY O DOLL AND SINCE HE WAS MY FRIEND. I PUT A SET OF MY PJ ON HIM AND HE SLEPT BY MY SIDE. I USE TO PUT ON SHOWS FOR MY FAMILY.

I THANK MY LOVING SISTER ALLISON FOR THE GIFT THAT MADE 1969 CHRISTMAS SO SPECIAL FOR ME. I HAD DANNY O DAY FOR TEN YEARS.
2,not worth it,"This book was ok in parts, but very outdated in thinking and in the legal aspects around S-Corporations. I was very excited to read the book as I own an S-Corporation, but the information contained in the book is not very useful. Instead of buying this book I suggest reading the online information from your state of incorporation, and picking up any standard law or CPA book that has chapters on S-Corps. I wanted to like this book, I really did, but it just was not worth it in its current form."
2,not what i was looking for,I found this book a little more geared towards someone who may know nothing. I took the time to sit down with a lawyer and he covered everything this book has to offer and more.
2,Off center,"Nice overall, but several of the security holes are so far off center as to make them useless. With the cost of shipping it makes the item impractical to return. Would be nice if there was a way to exchange the defective items."
4,it's useful,it's useful to my dad and we all like it~it'll be better if effect more quickly and i think i'll buy it in future.
3,callus again,Its okay will continue to use daily havenot seen any improvement since I startedusing it for my callus
4,Works as promised,"Use with caution because this is strong stuff. Used properly, it does the job very well."
5,Awesome,"A fantastic way to remove caluses on my feet, cuticles on fingers and toes! Works extremely fast! Calluses take a while to form after removal! way cheaper than going to a salon for a mani/pedi! Oh, the calluses on feet re-grow smooth. When I use a file while taking a bath when the calluses regrow they are often ""scratchy"" I had to constantly aply lotion, but it was only a temp. fix!This is a fantastic product! You must use care to use it on your cuticles tho. I use a fine paint brush & they are removed with in a couple minutes. I never leave it on for longer that 2 maybe 3 minutes."
5,Awesome,"I went for a pedicure while on vacation in Texas and the guy was complaining about how I must walk around in bare feet all the time, blah, blah, blah. The next thing I know he puts some of this stuff on my feet and they were baby soft! A MUST HAVE."
2,Brutal..,"It works... but it's brutal. Follow the directions precisely. Don't let it get on non callous skin (or it'll burn and hurt like hell). It does work, I just don't like the way it works."
3,Works as good as Draino.....has almost or more than 50% of the Lye as Toilet Drain Openers + Cleaners,"American InternationalBe NATURAL Callous EliminatorThe bottle with Earth Friendly green printing?Asking about that product?Company document below.My review?Works as good as Draino.....has almost or more than 50% of the Lye as Toilet Drain OpenersThe active ingredient of this product is Potassium Hydroxide, lye, used to clean clogged drains.If we use it sparingly, with ventilationNever touch non calloused skin,We should never inhale, ingestThis can affect the lungs etc...See below...Potassium hydroxideAs drain cleaner has 18-36%Callous Eliminator has 19+%Manicure and pedicure professionals, have quit, rather than use this brandMany are undettered and stilluse this productHere are the WARNINGSFrom this companyandthe State of New Jersey.gov Right To Know[...]"
3,This is an okay product.,"It doesn't cure cancer or save the rainforest as some of the other reviews might lead you to believe, but it does help take a layer of callus off the with aid of a good pumice scrubbing. I've used it twice now over about a week and my calluses are smoother, but there are still calluses. Perhaps if you are the type with only mild callusing this would take care of it for you, but for the elephant-footed (such as myself) it's going to be hard for any one product to do the job."
3,Softens calluses but seems a bit weak,"Although this is my first time using something like this, I took extra precaution after reading the reviews expecting it to be harsh. It works ok, but seems much weaker than I expected, leaving some rough skin intact even after soaking, leaving the solution on for 5 minutes, then using a pumice bar and file.My product that just arrived, despite the bottle looking the same as in the photo here, contains the active ingredient Potassium Hydroxide. There is no Dihydroxy Propylene in mine, as is listed in the product page. I suspect that AII may of shifted to a weaker or more watered down version due to misuse or burns. Still it works ok enough to keep, but I'll try to contact AII to ask about this change before reordering."
4,effective but use with care,"it is a solution that once applied to the soles will emove some of the callusbe carefull, your soles are going to be very slippery and on tile you can fall"
5,Dry Heels?,"I would give this 10 stars if I could. WOW! I have DRY heels, at times even cracked. I go for pedicures & feel so good when I leave. Then those dry, cracked heels would return. They reccommended callus eliminator. Unbelievable. 1st put on gloves, then rub on heels, let it sit @ 5 minutes(depending on heels), then use a pumice stone-get scrubbin'! Your heels will be so smooth. If you have dry heels, cracked, callused-TRY THIS! You won't regret it."
2,so-so,This product initially removed some layers of calluses but quit working by the third application. I'll try to find a better product.
1,Worthless,I had absolutely no results from this product. I tried multiple times to use it and it did nothing. Worthless.
3,So-So Results,"I wasn't incredibly pleased with this product. It did remove some built up callus', but it didn't seem to work as well as other reviews made it seem. It did however make my hands peel, so maybe my feet are just rougher than most others. I say give it a try, because it does yield results, but not if you have rough feet like I do. Head to your local salon and have them take care of you."
4,Worked great on callous feet.,This is a pretty good product. I think I was expecting a little more out of it than I got but I did remove a lot of dead skin. You have to have a metal file or something pretty sturdy to help you file off all the dead skin after soaking your feet.
2,defective bottle?,"After all the glowing reviews I had great hopes for this product. I've used it several times and ABSOLUTELY no difference. No burning, no reaction , no results. What a disappointment!!"
1,Product recieved broken,Bad packaging.. I should be fully reibursed beacuse of the waste of time......I will appreciate if you guys can do something about it.
2,dissapointed,did't work as i thought it would.didn't work no better than a lot of the product that i've purchase at the pharmacy.I thought the price would have made a difference in the product
5,Works!,"Even though getting a pedicure 'done' at the salon feels good, it's such a waste of money. This stuff is the same product the girls use at the salon by my house and they charge $5 each time they use it on me, and they don't leave it on long enough so I prefer to do it myself. It really works...you just 1) soak your feet for a few minutes to soften up the calluses 2) apply this product 3) wipe off (it doesn't rinse easily so wipe first) 4) rinse your feet in warm water and lastly 5) use a pumice scrubber to gently buff the rough skin off- which takes very little time since the chemicals in this product soften the skin for you. Yay!"
3,"Runny, but it works","It works fine, but just wish it were less runny and more viscous so that I could keep it in one area. I have a thin 1/4"" ridge of white skin at the edge of my heels - I'd like to focus on just that."
5,Effortless,"Observations By a First Time UserPROS- Effortless!- Scent-free- Feet are so, so incredibly smooth now, like the way legs feel after being Nair-ed!- Works as directed, but I did have to do a 2nd application for maximum callus elimination since I noticed the first 5 minutes didn't really cut it. Maybe my callouses were really bad =/. I don't recommend anyone doing 10 minutes like I did just in case your skin is more sensitive than mine, but am just suggesting that it is possible to leave it on that long without skin being burned to the bone.CONS- A little hard to wash off, so use a towel or loofah rather than just with water alone- Box came from Amazon seller Big Daddy Beauty...that raised my roommate's eyebrows...- None, really! Just make sure to pay attention to the tingly feeling close to the end of the process. Mine started feeling a little sensitive, so I'm sure had I left it on longer, dire things would have resulted.Good luck! Let me know if you have questions!"
1,bad decision,i used this as directed and no deal. i was also upset that the product leaked in the package even before it was delivered. i followed the instructions as shown on you tube with plastic wrap and so forth. it simply does not work in a nutshell.
2,Didn't do the job,I purchased the Emjoi MicroPedi Foot Buffer AP-3RP at the same time and that did the job without the potential danger of the Callus Eliminator which has the danger of burning or damaging tissue.
5,WORKS,I ALWAYS SEE THE SALONS USING PRODUCTS LIKE THIS AND IT WORKS. COMBINE WITH THE CALLUS REMOVER TOOL AND IT IS EASY AND SHOWS MAJOR RESULTS A MUST HAVE.
5,Best product! Awesome Price!,I have used this product for about two years and my heels are as soft as a baby's!!! The price and super fast shipping can't be beat.
4,I like it,"I like it... its not amazing, like the hard skin does not just fall off but I did notice my skin felt better after I scrubbed them... Key is you need a good scrubber!"
5,Robin,This product is wonderful. I've used it twice so far and my heels are soft and smooth. And the treatment lasts for weeks.
1,Not so great ...,"I did not find this product very helpful. I was careful to follow the instructions exactly as provided, but for me simply using file or egg shaped file and then using their heal lotion to be much more effective if used on a regular basis."
4,Be Natural,"This product works! After my first use (following the directions) my feet felt baby smooth (however, the feeling did not last terribly long) You must follow up between usages with other products (lotions, etc) - My feet stayed MUCH better than before, but lost the ""baby"" quality- I will buy this product again"
2,only a supplment not a solution,"So I've tried this twice over the past two days and even after using this product as the instructions on the bottle indicated, I had to do a GREAT deal of buffing with a foot file.. just as much as I would had I not used this product.. not too impressed.. this maybe helps a little, with dry heels, but it doesn't do much for actual calluses on the balls of ones feet from wearing heels. NOT impressed."
2,Careful with this one!,"I purchased this to remove callouses from my feet. It sure did,but be careful. Even wearing gloves my hands became itchy and red. In a week my fingernails became weakened and peeled. This product did its job and more for me. I'd recommend using it in a salon...NOT at home!"
2,A little aftaid,After ordering and reading I was afraid to use it because I was concered I would be chemically burned. I'm sure if I had followed directions I wouldn't have but I'm very cautionary on things like that of those types of products.
1,Be Natural Callus Eliminator - don't use!,"PLEASE be careful using this product! I had a salon use this on my feet during a pedicure and they got some on the soft part of the bottom of my foot (right in the middle) and now I have cuts and burns all over the bottom of the foot. It was fine on my heels, but it caused cuts and burns on the side of my ankle and side of the foot as well. I wouldn't use it!"
1,Didn't work for me,"I had high hopes for this product, based on word-of-mouth and the other customer reviews, and I was severely disappointed. I tried this product twice as directed, and it didn't do anything more than a normal soak and scrub would do. I suggest you spend your $20 on a pedicure instead."
1,All hype : disappointed,Ordered this base on these rave reviews claiming that this is some miracle product I feel ripped off/ bamboozled !!! It is not a miracle in fact it didn't burn my non callus parts!! Think of Elmer's glue when it dries how you can peel it. That is what this product basically is. Save your money and get some cetaphil from the pharmacy!! Please don't be a dummy and waste your money !! Be natural should be called beripoff!
1,NOT BRAND NEW,"Ive used this product before whenever I got my pedicures, but this time I decided to order my own and save the money$$, but when this was shipped here it was spilled everywhere it was not brand new!"
4,honstly i havent tried it out yet,ialways get pedicures and they had this item so i decided to try it out!
3,worked well,"my feet are very soft now - not sure if it was the sally hansen filed plus this product, but i like my feel now :)"
1,Didn't work,"After reading the great reviews I purchased this, didn't work for me, not sure if it was expired but it just did not work at all. I even tried leaving it on way longer than recommended and it just didn't work. Won't try again."
2,Framed you have been,"Don't start here if you are a first time buyer. Patchy at best. Sultans Choice, Blackhouse and Sirrocco are hardly great songs.Pick up Next which is brilliant. Not a bad track"
1,What were they thinking?,"This movie really stunk. It must be public domain because all these public domain el cheapo tape companies carried this title and the print was completely out of focus, like a bad bootleg. Even apart from the atrocious quality of the image the film looked mediocre at best and Joan didn't photograph as well in color. Stick with Joan and Louis (Jourdan) in the wonderful black and white classic Letter to an Unknown Woman.Caveat emptor!"
3,Not for dogs who love to chew. Toy requires supervision.,"My dog has had fun with this new toy. She likes the way it rolls across the floor when thrown. It also provides enough grip for us to play tug of war with it.My dog is 11 now, so she's no longer high energy. She's a large dog (70 pounds) and even though this toy is recommended for smaller dogs, my dog enjoyed this toy.This would not be a good toy for dogs who love to chew. I know some dogs who could destroy this toy in a matter of seconds. I would also be concerned for dogs who may break off a piece of plastic and swallow it. Plastic shards can have sharp edges that can hurt the gastrointestinal tract. I highly recommend that this toy only be given to dogs that are supervised."
2,Omega Paw Blue Orbit Flying Disk Jr.,"I didn't care for this product, because after a couple of hours of the dogs playing with it. It already had holes in it and looked that it wouldn't last long. The dogs loved playing with it. It just didn't last long."
1,Rock Hard,I could drive nails with this thing. My dog is 50 pounds and I am not going to throw it at him. maybe if he was 150 pounds
2,Not sure what to do with these...,"First of all, I was not expecting these to be the hard plastic that they turned out to be. I can't let my dog catch these -- if she catches it, I can hear the plastic cracking against her teeth and if she's a little off target, I can actually hear the thud when it hits her in the skull. They also don't fly that well. The shape is great for tug, but the hard plastic makes tug not only unsatisfying for my dog, but worries me as far as safety. My dog did enjoy stealing one of these from the counter and destroying it. I've been finding prickly, tiny shards of chewed up plastic for a month now. Since I know my dog likes to kill her toys, I ordered three of these at one time -- I still have two, but I let kids who come to visit play with them. They make great imaginary steering wheels and who knows what else for imaginative minds. As dog toys, however, I just don't understand what the designer was thinking."
2,Omega not so pet friendly,Our pup enjoyed the idea of chasing the Omega disk but she had some trouble trying to pick it up. She had to use her paws to flip it up just to grab it.
1,CANCELED,As much as i ;ove DBZ and want to have them on Blu-ray Dont buy these sets Funimation Suspends Dragon Ball Z Blu-ray Production.[...]
3,What does it have?,"What i do know is that the footage is better than the dragon boxes but until it is officially released we won't truley but from what i've seen, the blu ray footage looks better than any of the releases in color and quality. These use the original master unlike the false statement of the Dragon Boxes using them. The Dragon Boxes used the tape masters that didn't age but still had saturation. I'm not saying they suck but its regarded high b/c of it's packaging, opening and ending credits original text, previews, & no ommitted songs (Orange Bricks -__-). But if someone does know, will these have the Dragon Box footage? Why downgrade when the Dragon Boxes are out right? So, the logical thing is to release these forever-to-release-the-entire-show's blu-rays with all that footage...... right? Well, other than that, the image is the best from all the releases so far and the truest representation to the original thing (remember, most of us don't know if it has dragon box footage)."
2,I can not stand the 4:3 ratio!!,"Like many here I am a huge DBZ fan as I grew up with it as a child when it was on Toonami. I love the fact that the series has caught up with the times and has been remastered in such beautiful picture quality. The episodes are just as I remember them so long ago and are awesome to watch as an adult now. I do however have some major complaints. One is the price of each Blu Ray disc, 17 episodes is not really a fair trade off for the price. Two I can not stand the aspect ratio being stuck at 4:3. I understand that this is how it was originally was aired, but I would like it to at the least fit my screen. Maybe I am a bit OCD but having a 4:3 aspect being played within a 16:9 black box sucks. I really hope they don't carry this trend over in to the newer episodes."
1,Where is the HD?,"After updating the firmware, I had hoped that would change the lack of quality on this disc. Nope! Dragon Ball Z Kai looked better. This has no 16x9 aspect ratio, just 4:3 on a 16x9 screen. Extremely grainy, Sound is okay, but not worth the money. If you own it on regular DVD that should suffice for now. Save yourselves about 25 dollars do not buy this. You'd be better off buying the action figures. It clearly was not what I was hoping for."
1,Are you serious? 17 Episodes for $25?,"The fact that there are 291 episodes means there will be $449.82 worth of Blu-Ray in this collection (18 discs). I'd be a lot happier with each saga on it's own blu-ray mini box set, then to end up with 18 separate discs costing a fortune.And this is after releasing a terrible Kai edition of DBZ saga nearly gutting it to nothingness.Absolutely AWFUL!"
1,Could have been better,"When I heard funimation was releasing the dragonbox, I decided to hold out on buying them because I figure they might one day release Dragon Ball Z on Blu Ray. Considering Funimation has released this series 4 times already. So finally I got my wish. But the problem is this set is only 17 episode long. Come on funimation this set should be at least 30 episodes long. This show has been release 4 times by you. I understand if this was one piece which isn't that popular, it needs a fanbase in america and its never been officially released in the states. But this is dragon ball z its been released 4 times in america and its got the biggest anime fanbase in america right next to naruto.I reccommend that you skip this and wait until funimation releases dragonball z blu ray box sets with more episodes considering the fact that this series is 291 episodes long."
1,Really?,"I love how they are re-releasing the orange bricks on blu-ray, but with like half the amount of episodes as the orange brick season 1 box and for pretty much around the same price (actually I think you can find season 1 for pretty cheap now). If you are looking for DBZ boxsets, I highly recommend the dragonbox sets. They were cleaned up and still in 4:3 (none of that ""remastered"" wide screen crap that ruined the film quality in the orange bricks) with the original Japanese audio and english dubs. You get way more for the price range of the dragonbox compared to this blu-ray crap thats most likely the terrible orange bricks just thrown onto a blu-ray disc and has less episodes on it."

5,Great Book,This book presents the story of Spain in a simple way. Easy to read and comprehend for those that might not like history too much.
4,YOU WANT BOOK!,THIS BOOK AMAZING! SUPER GOOD WITH SPANISH LANGUAGE IN SPANISH! HISTORY OF SPAIN! READING IT FUN! GET GRADES SUPER DUPER! EAT CAKE FOR HOURS!
2,"Disapointing ""stories"". Mainly a history of the marathon.","It's a pretty book. Looked at once, though, and that will be it. There isn't much that is terribly amusing or interesting. Thought it would be more about just normal people running marathons. No. Just the history of the marathon."
3,"The original animation, but not the original voices.","This is the same Kimba that everyone fell in love with in the 60s, but because of legal problems the soundtrack has been replaced (that's the reason for the title change as well). This is a major disapointment for some of us. The new actors just don't sound right, and Isao Tomita's music is gone as well. As much as two minutes has been removed from each episode (there are two episodes per tape). To their credit, they re-visited the original Japanese version when writing the voice parts and some of the dialog changes appear to be truer to the creator's intent. If you want to see the original Kimba TV show, there simply is no other home video available."
5,great kit,"I bought the kit with no idea what the quality is but when i got it was pretty good.the kit is from a company called digital concepts the lens that i got were black not silver as the photo, they fit nicely and no problems what so ever and they are doing what they are supposed to do.The bag feels nice and can keep all the kit in except the tri-pod but it comes with its own bag.The filter set are from a company called crystal optics there is a pink, black and a clear lens, the do a decent job but black or gray could have been a bit darker but for the price its great.The wide lens is very noticeable so most of you would be happy as for the telephoto lens is nice but does not add that much but it could give that extra feet that you some times need.Overall i am happy with my purchase and its a great kit to start with its NOT a professional kit but great for starters like me."
5,"...And The Koreans Do It Again, Excellent Film ! ! !","Just got my copy today in the mail and watched it, and it was excellent! Of course, I knew it would be excellent since I have two other films from this director (Nightmare & Phone). I'm a big fan of all asian horror and I mean anything asian horror. I'm not one to put up any spoilers on my reviews and plus other reviewers have already given what the stories about. What I will say is that this is an excellent movie all around, great story, acting, sound & picture. Film is in excellent 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen picture and 5.1 Dolby Digital surround. Special features include trailer, previews, music video, and audio commentary."
5,Correcting behavior vs. correcting the attitude,"I have read four or five books about the subject and I must say that this one is the best for me in terms of feeling comfortable with his advice and obtaining immediate results.One of the characteristics that makes his approach different to many others is that while other books talk about changing the attitude of our kids before we can change their behavior, Robert MacKenzie teaches we should concentrate on obtaining the right behavior while ignoring their attitude. What is the logic behind it and why is it more effective? Because the bad attitudes our kids show are usually attempts to hook us into a power struggle. Once they realize we are not taking the bait any more, they stop trying; their attitude changes without us having to deal with it. It really works!"
4,Good set of basics for proper discipline,"This book has been really helpful. My wife and I were in a pretty regular tug-of-war with our three-year-old. We were getting to our own limits. The examples and techniques of this book made it pretty clear why we were in the jam we were in. Our son ruled the house...until we both read this book. The games came to a halt the next day. Our son was a little shocked at first and went to great lengths to try and test the limits of our authority. It was difficult at first, to say the least. But, after about two weeks of persistence on our part, we turned him around and put some very clear boundaries in place - PROBLEMS SOLVED!I'll say this: We paid about $15 after shipping for this. It took about three days to read. For the amount of peace and comfort we got in return, this is a fantastic investment for any family."
5,Super Well Written -- A Blessing in the Sea of Crappy Parenting Books,"I've read so many parenting books that have a few nuggets of great information, but are terribly written or just way or whose authors meander self-indulgently (yeah, I'm talking about you, Simplicity Parenting author!).This book is very well written, with lots of sample dialogs...realistic sample dialogs.It's not a cure all, but things have gotten much better. Give it a try."
4,"Useful, practical info.","I am picky about parenting books but read this one through (ok, it was repetetive so skimmed it is more accurate). Lots of examples and practical use of the theory. I found it made me think about the ineffectiveness of certain battles I was having and helped me form a more clear idea of how to approach my 3 y.o. daughter. I have noticed a difference in more positive interactions between us since applying methods in this book."
3,Didn't meet my needs,"This book was very well written, easy to read. The tools were easy to understand and apply for your ""run of the mill"" child. However, I have a very explosive, strong willed child. If I tried many of the techniques suggested it would definitely incite an explosion...I would recommend this book for a basic owner/operator manual for the even tempered child."
5,Great value for money,"I was really pleased with this book when I received it. I haven't finished reading it as yet, so I can't comment on what I think of its content, but what I have read so far, I am not disappointed. I was happy with it because for the price, I considered it to be a good quality book, and I am sure I couldn't have bought it for the price I paid if I bought it in a local book shop."
3,Quick Fix,"This seems to work until you, (and your child) realize that trying to force your kid to do what you want on command by threatening him is a quick fix but can not be used too much or your child will rebel against it. Do you want to threaten you child into doing everything?? That's what this book is about. That being said, there are some times when it is effective and appropriate."
5,I'm doing it all wrong....,This book really helped me how to parent my spirited 9 yr old girl. I realized more about her and learned that old school ways of parenting wasn't working. Do yourself a favor and order if you want to become a better parent!
3,ok,seems to work at some point. just have to stick with it. child will come around in the end hopefully
5,Confident parenting tool,Best resource ever invaluable spells out in black and what to do and how to do consequences consistency rules all we know we needed but ways to actually do it now it just takes practicing the tools with a new found confidence thank you
2,Too repetitive,"As other readers commented on, it's easy to read but the stories, nor the advice, vary too much. I don't recommend this book, there are much better books on this subject."
5,exasperated mother,We have a very bright 6 year old who is good at avoiding what he doesn't want to do. This book has been a godsend as it has helped us understand the way he operates. I would recommend it to anyone who has a strong-willed child. Why argue all the time when you can read this book and improve your family's quality of life!
3,"Most helpful for older kids, not toddlers","The basic concepts can be applied to toddlers with some adaptation, but the book is not at all designed for kids below 5 years old. The examples are almost uniformly children ages 5-12. I have a clearly strong willed toddler, and I would like to get off to a good start. Reading this book gives me some good theory to work with and some goals for discipline down the road, but it's not super helpful right now."
4,Not as applicable for young toddlers...,"I did not get as much from it as I probably would with an older child (Our son is about 2). It is well written, perhaps a bit repetitive at times but overall gives good advise on dealing with different situations."
5,Excellent parenting book,I recommend this book frequently for my clients who are having difficulty with their strong willed children. More than one client noted that 'I feel like he's looking through my window' when reading the book. Very helpful.
4,Another way to look at the strong-willed child.,"This book gives very good advice about managing behavior problems in difficult children. However, the concept of a ""strong-willed child"" is confusing because it implies a child with will power or self control. These difficult children actually have poor will power and self control. The techniques given in this book will help teach such children self control.It is important to understand that the cause of the strong-willed child is an excessive drive for power over others. The strong willed child wants to be Captain and he wants everyone else including his parents to be a deck hand. Parenting this type of child correctly, will help him learn to better control himself and respect others. However, he will likely never be the compliant child that some parents are hoping for. [...]"
4,Helpful ideas,"This book was great when I used what I agreed with and ignored the parts I didn't. We were getting in nightly arguments with our then three-year-old and the book told us to not let the kid get us in an argument - instead go straight to the consequence before tension grows. This worked wonders for our strong-willed child (granted, he is not nearly as strong-willed as I know other kids can be). There were parts I completely ignored such as it recommends that when a timeout is over, let the problem drop. I would rather talk to my kid about why he got the timeout afterward when he's calmer and more rational. The book also gives gives corny (and too perfectly constructed) examples. But since tension significantly reduced after implementing the parts I agreed with, I can easily overlook these downfalls."
5,hotdog,This book is a must have. I just told someone today that they should hand this out to parents in the hospital. The techniques are easy to use and they make a huge impact. I went from feeling like my son was running the show to having control over the events in my house. My husband and I are so enthusiastic about this book that we purchased several more copies and handed them to friends. The author is a genuis and it's fantastic to see that you can effectively parent and never lose control or belittle your kids. BRAVO
4,very helpful guidelines,"I found this book to be very helpful in setting forth a discipline program to follow that is easy to remember and implement, and best of all, it really works! Any program that advocates spanking wasn't for me, so this book really laid out a straight forward, common sense program that has turned my daily struggles with my 3 year old around in a few short weeks. I enjoy interacting with my son again and teaching him how to control his behavior (and my responses to his behavior) instead of feeling like we are both spinning out of control. I also really appreciated the explanations behind the behavior of strong willed children - I now understand my child much better and don't take his behavior personally and this has made a huge difference in our relationship."
5,Fabulous book on Discipline,I found this book very helpful. I have read many childcare articles and some books tbat recommend setting firm limits. This is the first book that actually told me how to set firm limits. The techniques and many examples in the book have helped me in my dealings with all three of my children--not just the strong-willed middle one. The book made me realize I am not alone and that my child is not abnormal.
2,Better books out there,"This book is based on the ideas inPositive Discipline. There is practically nothing new, except the idea that a spirited child will test your limits again and again, so you have to be even more consistent. There! Now that you know that, just get the Positive Discipline, which is excellent. It describes the background of the method, specific approaches, gives you ideas for all ages. ""Setting Limits"", btw, is much harder to adapt to a toddler. The writing is leaves something to be desired as well."
1,Dumb smelling movie,OK YALL FIRST OF ALL. I WAS FORCED TO SEE THIS MOVIE!This movie was really really really dumb.I mean im no fan of the rugrats but adleast it was ok.There was only two things they really advertised.There dog could talk and you could smell the movie (so what)Theres like a million movies with talking Animals and um you can smell it wow scratch and sniff from a shoe store and fast food food joint thats really amazingno offence to the people who actually liked this movie
2,Can we end the Rugrats already?,"This movie seemed cute from the previews, putting together different characters from two different shows seemed interesting. But they just had to ruin it with all the ""poo poo pee pee"" humor that the creators obviously thought would guarantee laughs from the kiddies. My two little cousins laughed maybe once or twice through the whole movie and it wasn't because of those stupid jokes. Don't get me wrong, I can enjoy that kind of humor, but this was just embarrassing.And I'm really hoping this is the last time we see the Rugrats in a movie because I'm sick of them. Like I said before, pairing them up with The Wild Thornberries seemed interesting but it just went down hill. The only good episodes of the Rugrats were the old ones, now those were funny. And now it's been what, 13 years? End it for God's sake!"
1,Well,"Ok, well I highly recomend this movie to anyone under the age of 7, because my 8 yr old brothers and sister did not like it, but on the other hand, my 5 yr old cousin did. I highly recomend Finding Nemo over this one, the entire family could enjoy that, and you can also enjoy Finding Nemo without every other sentence having potty humor in it, and seriously, the potty humor gets old, FAST. It starts out decent, then has a very very long stretch of being horrible, then it builds back up to the decent point for a few minutes, then it ends... I couldn't stand this movie, but then again I'm a 15 years old and I have a life. So I recomend it to the very young audience, but anyone else, go see something of really good quality like Finding Nemo or Bruce Almighty(which I thought was going to be a terrible movie but turned out very good)."
3,"Only enjoyed when kids come along?, or not?","I enjoyed this movie because my 9 year old cousin went with me to see the movie, and when she laughed, I laughed, it sometimes works that way. I was also curious to see this movie because I wanted to see how Nickelodeon would do the job in uniting The ""Thornberries"" with the ""Rugrats"", and they did an o.k. job at doing it. It also has some things that only the adults and some children would understand, like when they refer to Gilligan. I bet half of the kids watching the movie don't understand that. And also for you parents that like musicals and haven't seen one in a long time, watch this movie. This movie is more of a musical than an adventure.This movie is recommended for children 5 and up"
3,borderline,While the majority of this movie was fun and exciting I thought it walked a fine line at times between light hearted silliness and raunchy. There were a few moments where I contemplated a quick fast forward but all in all I liked it for the meeting between the Thornberries and the Rugrats.
3,Fragile Fun,"Playmobil toys are wonderful, no question, but the more elaborate they are, the more problematic. This ship is gorgeous and has great detail, including real string rigging. This toy took forever to assemble, especially that pesky rigging, with the usually excellent insrtuctions falling short. After about a day of playing, my two boys had dismantled the ship enough that it wasn't fun anymore, and after three days I could no longer get all the parts back together. It is now a somewhat expensive box filler. The other Playmobil Pirate sets are still much loved, and have been conscripted on the nearly invincible Good Ship Fisher-Price."
5,The most popular toy in our home!,"I purchased this pirate ship for my son's fourth birthday. This is by far the most popular toy in our house! My 8 year old son and 6 year old daughter also love this toy. There are so many items that come with the ship - from canon balls, swords, treasure chest full of goodies, food, animals and even jewelery for the pirates - they are never bored. My four year old plays on his own, or with his friends, and when all three are home they all play together. Definitely worth the investment for the amount of joy this toy has brought to our home!!"
1,Too many little pieces,"Bought for three- and five-year old boys. Too many pieces and extra accesories to to keep track of. They were all over the house. It took hours to put the pirate ship together and once it came apart, it couldn't be put back together again. I do not recommend this item."
3,Tool of the trade but needs to be on a CD,"Without question, Black's is the quintessential dictionary for lawyers, paralegals and others involved with the legal trade. Foolishly, it is not available in electronic format (a' la CD). There is a critical need for that. Forget the overpriced 7th edition released in Fall 1999. It is not worth $20 more."
3,A mix of new and old,"Evaluating a CD like this is difficult, because many of the tracks can be found on other CDs. Although I really enjoyed ""Left where it fell.""If you don't have much Brian Eno in your collection and would like to explore his ambient, this is a good buy. I'd also consider this a good gift for someone who hasn't been introduced to Brian Eno.That being said, I enjoyed hearing Brian Eno speak, the first time. Since then, I skip that particular track. Not that I didn't appreciate it, but that I load up my computer with music, and like music to be music and words to be words. It's just a triffle pretentious. It is facinating, to hear where Eno places himself, what his influences are."
4,Nice bargin,"No problems so far. I received the lens surprisingly fast and in great condition. I shot an outdoor basketball game with very good results. I got some good depth of field shots at f2.8. The AF worked well, and but the motor was not as quiet as I expected. I can live with that, I'm not photographing grasshoppers. I would recommend this lens it's a good bargain."
2,"Good lens, did not last very long.","Bought this lens back in February 2006. I am an hobbyist photographer and used this lens often. I take care of my equipment, everything is kept clean and in a Canon backpack case.A couple months ago it started to get noisy when zooming. Now it will not zoom at all. At the time I paid 80$ for the lens, it would cost me 100$ to have the lens fixed. I have 2 other lenses that I got around the same time, a Canon and a Tamron that are still working.Have heard from others that Sigma's have lost their build quality, will not buy another Sigma lens."
4,Good Replacement for the Kit Lens,I bought this lens as a replacement to my kit lens. I use a Canon XT as a backup to my Sony Alpha so I bring it on less important photo ops. I just took it on vacation with me to Florida and took alot of great shots with it using just autofocus. It's nice lens to have when you want to take something manageable and more responsive than a compact point and shoot. I'd definitely recommend it.
4,Great value,"I was hesitant to get the lens because it was so in-expensive. I've been happy with it based on how much I spent, actually I was pleasantly surprised by the results I am getting from it. It does a good job with indoor photos which I was looking for when I bought it. It does have a tendency to take hazy pictures if shooting with back light I have found. I basically needed an effective lens that gave me some zoom options but was fast enough to capture kids indoors or in low light and this has done just fine with that. It's not the same quality as more expensive lenses but it does a great job considering the price."
3,Sigma 28-70MM,"Pretty decent lens. Reminds me of the standard 18-55mm that came with my T3i. I wanted a cheap middle of the road lens that could do 2.8 for low light. Haven't used it for video yet. Get used to the manual focus, resolution is better to me, that using auto focus. But for the price the lens is worth it."
3,Good album,"I liked this album but these guys certainly aren't doing anything new. I like Bleeding Through and Avenged Sevenfold and these guys were recommended to me by a friend. Thw whole album is really easy to listen to, but it still leaves something to be desired. I can imagine that the guys were ready to rip some heads off while they recorded this album, but it doesn't seem to come across all that well on record. I'm looking forward to seeing a live show and I hope that they will blow me away and I'll have to kick myself in the butt for giving them such a mediocre review!"
4,Another Hit from Diana Palmer,"I discovered Diana Palmer books some years ago and am diligently buying all I can find and this story like all her others is well scripted, has a sympathetic story and of course a happy ending.Diana writes so many about the Jacobsville residents and I feel that the townsfolk are my neighbours.I am looking forward to her latest book dangerous."
3,irritated,"I found this book disappointing in that I had ordered two other books in a similar vein at the same time, only to find, after delivery, that this book actually included much of the content of one of the others. It had not been clear to me at the time of purchase that this book was an edited collection of info from other authors/artists rather than independent and original info by this author. Its content would be fine as stand-along material, but in conjunction with the other books it was redundant to my needs. My other criticism is that, to some extent and in some places, this book fails to provide adequate instruction on the nitty-gritty of how to do what it suggests one should do in order to achieve the desired results. That said, it's good in that it offers examples of effects that can be achieved in a variety of artistic mediums."
2,That's 103 minutes R&R time I ain't never gonna get back,"Wow. I'm almost speechless at how horrid this was. I DVR'd it because I love Michael Beihn. Wow has he aged, and not for the better. I was happy to see Sean Patrick Flanery... I liked him in the Stargate SG-1 episode he guest starred in. He did a GREAT job of being a complete LOSER in this film. And the bunnies were absolutely preciously cute. That's all I have to say. Cuz, wow. Just. Wow."
3,Story has some bite to it.,"It's not great, a little slow in the beginning, some of the lesser roles offer lesser acting but it's got something extra that your average vamp flick doesn't. Sean Patrick Flanery is a lovable loser you want to be happy. Charlotte Ayanna is beautiful, dangerous but not entirely unsympathetic and Michael Biehn should have been in the picture more, he's that enjoyable. Should you buy it? I say no. Should you see it? I say yes."
4,vamp-trapped,i was surprised with this movie. it was very interesting as the plot is different from every other vampire movie i've seen. well acted and it kept your interest right up to the end. well worth the money for vampire movie fans
5,Wonder of wonder! I love my hammock!,"I love my hammock. I actually have 2 now, and they are both in my backyard. I like the white because it goes well with my yard, and sometimes with the multi colored ones you never know what you're going to get. It is also extremely comfortable. If you combine this with the smell of cut grass and a cool breeze and I think you may have just found the key to life."
4,In The Shade...,"How wonderful an item that provides comfort and stability at such an affordable price to relax in the evening shade. No yard should be without the ever-enticing hammock - and now available in RAINBOW colors, too! How fun!"
3,almost up to U2 standard,"...but not quite. I liked the variation between songs, but without good discernable melodies.I was surprised I hadn't heard of them before (I picked up the cd at a garage sale for nothing :)"
1,Promotional material,"I have several of Larry's books and some are really good. But this one is probably the worst book I have ever read coming from him. The title is misleading, the subject of stocks is almost totally ignored. The information revealed on commodities is not worth much and a lot of the buying and selling points are very subjective. No exit strategy is ever discussed. The book has little content and a lot of charts and silly jokes.The sole purpose of this book is to sell you Larry's paid recommendation services on commodities and stocks."
3,lcsmith,Not a bad book some new concepts. Larry please be more business like I'm sure your a great guy and definetly bright talented and the trading world is a better place with you in it but it was a little tough to read through all the fluff
4,Right or wrong he entertains,"He has something opinionated to write about practically everything. It is hard to imagine a reader who will not find something they are interested in this book. He is writing to relieve some kind of artistic tension. He does not try to prove anything with a lot of facts. H. L. Mencken likes to deposit a well written idea that is designed to attract attention by coming across as extreme or different from conventional wisdom and then move on to the next subject.For instance, most historians think that Martin Luther's Reformation had something to do with starting the Renaissance. Mencken creatively states as fact that Luther killed the Renaissance that was raising in Rome."
2,Much good information but just too big to carry daily,This is the textbook we use for the beginning nursing class. It provides much information for the nursing student but it is just too big to carry to school everyday. I know the authors have seperate clinical skills book. They just try to make more money from the students. They should just seperate the this book into two sections-theory and skills. This will be much helpful for the students to handle it.
3,This book is a mystery to me~,"I had purchased this book for my introductory nursing course. I found it very boring to read and difficult to follow. It should be written by Perry Mason!However, I do feel that in later years, it is a good reference and is good for assessing patients."
4,This is a fine story collection.,"I liked every story in this collection, and truly admired several. My favorite was the title story, ""I Got Somebody in Staunton,"" because it deviates from the book's dominant, narrow narrative view of race relations. The protagonist, who has valid reasons to be concerned about the environment he's in, learns that the reality of the situation was slightly different from what he'd perceived. A very powerful story is ""Urban Renewal,"" about a bereaved mother who challenges a condescending college president to take a truly meaningful step to reach out to the poor, black community that is neighbor to his campus.Fans of Edward P. Jones will like this collection very much."
4,So Real,"William Henry Lewis has great style. All of the short stories in this collection were not great, but his style and ability to bring to life characters you can easily identify with makes it worth the read. Shades, In The Swamp, Urban Renewal, and Crusade were my favorite stories in this collection. He is masterfully creative. He makes you ""feel"" the charaters."
3,"wonderful images of a brief overview, with a text that lacks","blah, blah, blah, yackety, schmackety..."
1,Can't review something I never received,Never received the product as the seller said current stock was out of date. Never heard anymore from them.
2,"Big, but not real useful","Unless you write music with a felt-tipped marker, I'd look for something else. The staves in this volume are large and extremely dark. The typical (pencilled) scribbles of composers will be difficult to read on this paper."
4,decent manuscript paper at a great price,"Each page has twelve 11mm staves with 10mm between each. This can get cramped quickly depending on the music, so if you're looking for a high-quality paper for a nice-looking manuscript, look elsewhere. If not, this is hard to beat for the price. I use only one side of the paper, so this works out to about $.043 per page.The paper itself is fairly sturdy, and the perforations let them tear out without too much trouble. The one-page 'notation guide' is useless unless you don't know the difference between a quarter note and a rock.As for ease of readability, the staves are fairly bold and might cause problems for pencil users. Personally, I find that pen doesn't smear and is easier to read than pencil, and erasures take much more time than scribbling over a passage anyway. That said, this paper I've found perfect for manuscripts ranging from solo instruments through piano and chamber pieces and even large ensemble sketches."
2,"""Mine must have been made on a Friday""","Every time I tried to tear out a page, it ripped the darned thing in several pages. I took a course in jazz arranging, with weekly (or so) assignments. My teacher, catching on to the pattern...said that my book must have been made on a Friday. Ha! I will be upgrading to a little more quality product. Sorry, but this doesn't fit my needs. Staves are too big, not enough space between them. The binding makes the innermost inch or so unusable unless you tear it out...but I already told you about that problem."
5,Gets the job done,This is my first book of staff paper and it is working for what I need it for. No complaints.
2,Not recommended,"The problem with this paper is that the lines are printed very darkly. This makes pencil marks difficult to read, so you would have to use a felt tipped marker to make it more readable. Then the problem is that you can't erase.Ideally, the lines would be printed in a somewhat light red or green, if not light gray, because this would contrast with pencil markings the best. The paper is also not pre hole punched."
4,The Big Book of Staff Paper,"Great stuff. Looks good, high quality. Does its job well. The perforated edges can be a bit tough, but its blank sheet music! Its not supposed to look pretty. And for the price, it can't be beat!"
1,B___I___G.......D I S A P P O I N T M E N T,"The lines in this book, THE BIG BOOK OF STAFF PAPER. (MANUSCRIPT PAPER),are dark and close together, making writing notes above and below the staff just about impossible. The pages are NOT spiral bound, making writing ANY notes difficult. Writing music, and having it published, in the highly-competitive music industry is hard enough. One need not add to one's problems by buying this book -- especially when there are so any other, (and spiral-bound!) music-writing books around. I tried to use the pages from my book as scrap paper....but the lines were just TOO DARK, and too close together. The 8 1/2"" x 11"" pages are too small to wrap fish. I finally had to throw mine out."
4,Difficult to rate.,"I hesitated to put my name to this review as the film is a bit perverse... hell, it's a LOT perverse. Redefines 'dysfunctional family'.Dad - a failed TV reporter trying to film a documentary on teen sex ends up bedding his daughter. Pays no attention to the abuse in his household.Mom - a heroine addicted amateur prostitute who is routinely beaten by her teenaged son.Son - constant victim of bullies who takes it out on his Mom. Has a collection of instruments for the beatings.Daughter - teen hooker who had no problem seducing dad.Visitor Q - Hit dad on the head with a rock on two occasions before moving in with the family and participating in, if not promoting, the madness.That's just the setting. There's plenty more (like sex with a corpse, murder, enthusiastic lactation and more).Director Takashi Miike is know for these way, way, way off the wall films and if you can open your mind for them they are quite enjoyable. Visitor Q is one of his best."
1,Visitor Q,"I almost vomited 4 TIMES!!!! This is the most shocking, mind-twisting, degenerate film I've ever seen! You must see to believe!"
1,Sorry I bought it.,"This cd had beats that went no where, samples that had no meaning, and incessant loops. I was very disapointed with it because the label has some of the best stuff out there."
3,boring,"why would i listen to freaky chakra when i could listen to the real thing? There are still some plastikman cd's i dont got yet. freaky has skill, but he aint plastikman."
5,Gorgeous and Easy To Put Together,"I loved this thing the first time I saw it assembled. So I purchaed it for my grand niece. I was afraid that I would not have the time to put it together, given what the other reviews said (one says a day and a half). Well, maybe I have a penchant for such kits, but it took me about 2 1/2 hours, spread over a couple of days. The instructions made it amazingly easy. So far, I see no problem with the roof, either. Once you snap it together correctly and have the roof ""crown"" firmly in place, it seems to be fine. As other reviews have stated, the thing is gorgeous. Well worth every penny I spent for it."
3,Where's the emotion?,"Highway being Free's fourth recording came off the heels of the album Fire and Water that broke it open for them on both sides of the the Atlantic. Compared to previous works this album is missing the emotion that was on their first three recordings. Buy FREE live instead and hear Be My Freind,Ride On A Pony, with the emotion,intensity and fire that FREE was known for. Don't get me wrong, the songs are well written but more mellower than earlier albums."
1,Failure of Locking Mechanism,"I like the lopping aspect of the Corona Pole Saw , but the Extension locking mechanism is an extremely poor design !! How anyone in their right mind would expect this to adequately lock without pulling out , during aggressive sawing , is beyond my comprehension ?? Therefor my rating of this saw is LOW !!!!!! DO NOT BUY !!!!"
1,Troublesome,"For a high end pruner, I expected better.The chain has almost no tension and keeps jumping out.A nut fell off and was lost. The pull handle fell off.The above happened in the first hour of use.This pruner is rather heavy and is hard to manage whenit is fully extended. I'll go back to using my cheapaluminum pruner for everything that it will reach."
3,Bad locking mechanism,"The telescoping plastic locking mechanism is of the compression type and does not lock adequately during aggressive sawing strokes. The pole extends instead of completing the down sawing stroke. On the plus side the 13"" blade cuts with ease and stays sharp. I've had the same blade after 4 years of use with only the spring finally giving out. Replacement parts are available locally and at on line retailers. With a better locking mechanism I would rate 5 stars."
2,Corona Clipper not without problems,"The lopping function of this compound tool works reasonably well, but only on relatively thin limbs--up to about 1 1/4 inches. The saw is a different matter. The blade is beautiful--a japanese pull stroke saw which is very sharp. The problem is in the telescoping pole mechanism. The action of sawing loosens the locking mechanism on the pole, no matter how hard one tries to tighten it. And one wouldn't dare use a wrench because the mechanism is plastic. So it's almost impossible to get enough torque for sawing high up when the pole is continually lengthening itself!"
2,locking mechanism sticks,"The lopping and sawing work fine, but the plastic extension lock is stuck so I can't loosen it. In spite of that, the extension mechism slips when I put strong sawing pressure on it. This is a very back feature on an otherwise well-engineered product.I certainly would not buy this pruner if I had it to do over again."
5,#1 Mother Goose collection,"My 6 & 7 year olds have reviewed several Mother Goose books, and this is hands-down their favorite. The illustrations were great and it had all the old classics I could remember. It also had about half of the rhymes I had not heard before, but all were charming, even if occasional editing is needed for some parents to avoid certain topics mentioned in other reviews here."
3,Collection of less well-known rhymes which doesn't click,I was looking for a compilation of familiar nursery rhymes to get my kids started in the wonderful world of words. I was disappointed in what I consider to be a limited and weak collection of rhymes. Illustrations are good.
2,Very Disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this book. Some of the additional verses added to familiar rhymes change the rhythm of the rhyme, and do not mesh. Many rhymes, including ""Jack and Jill"" have a different second verse from the traditional one. ""Hush Little Baby"" is incomplete. Many of the rhymes are non-traditional.I don't even want my child to hear some of these poems! They talk about a man who wouldn't say his prayers so ""I took him by the left leg and threw him down the stairs,"" giving a barber a pinch of snuff, and other such things."
5,Brings Back Fond Memories,"Bought this as a gift for my baby granddaughter. The anniversary edition is just as beautiful as I remember from 25 years ago when this book was my son's favorite for bedtime reading. All the familiar rhymes are here, each one delightfully illustrated in the most vivid colors."
5,One of Catherine Cookson's best! Highly recommended!,"""The Round Tower"" is one of the best Catherine Cookson adaptations ever! It is lush, well-acted, romantic and a must for any Cookson or British drama fan. The story centers around young, strong-willed, wealthy Vanessa Ratcliffe (Emilia Fox - ""Pride & Prejudice,"" ""Rebecca"") and ambitious, handsome, poor Angus Cotton (Ben Miles). Both are good friends, despite objections from her snobbish parents. When Angus is wrongly accused in Vanessa's pregnancy, the turn of events brings them closer together but later threaten to break them apart. This addresses such themes as ambition, class conflict and prejudices, personal vs. familial responsibility, and love. A touching, sweet love story! I loved every minute of it!"
1,Video would noy play,I was able to play the Part 1 just fine. However Part 2 would not play and even unraveled inside my VCR. The case was also cracked and the box did not look new. I have sent back the video but as yet I have not received a refund. Linda Hodson
2,Not Worth the Price Charged,"This movie is lacking in many ways and the price is far above a two star rate movie, as far as I am concerned. Some may like the movie more than I and think the price is worthly. It could have been better directed and the actors did well with their parts. It lacked in many directions and I am sorry I bought it based on the high reviews it received. Maybe I expect more. Sorry to anyone who rated this movie so highly, but I do not consider it worth paying the price to have in my library of movies."
4,Oh well,"I was a little disappointed in the suit I was prepared for a bad looking suit..I mean it is a grab bag even tie dye or polka dot or anything else I could think of would have been fine (I chose this option because I was buying for practice suits not for fashion.), but the suit I received was so ugly there is no way I would wear it. But If you really don't mind what you get it is a good program ,Just remember you get what you pay for.(I didn't know they made suits that looked like what I received)Oh well"
2,Unhappy with the color and the style....,"Well, of course it is a grab bag, and you should not expect anything like the latest season collection, and I do not care much in what to swim, as it is for excersize, not for the beach. However, I was quite disappointed with both the style (spaghetti straps) and the color (narrow oblique magenta stripe on black). They have also sent me a swimming cap of toxic-pink color either to chear me up, or to promote their website (the shop name and adress is printed on the cap)...That's my first experience with grab bags, not sure it's the last, as all the designs I saw on internet were ok for me, and there are so many positive reviews here..."
5,A perfect option for the routine swimmer!,"I'm a routine swimmer who used to swim competitively and now swim 3-4 times a week to stay in shape. I knew that I wanted a speedo suit because I know their sizing and their fit, but didn't really care what it looked like, so I ordered from the grab bag. When it arrived, it was just like any other suit I would have happily bought in a store -- mostly black with a subtle blue design with wide straps. I'd highly recommend this option for anyone who just wants to use the suit to swim and doesn't care too much about the pattern."
5,Good quality suits,"These are good quality Speedo suits - for competetive swimmers, Speedo suits last longer than Tyr suits. I generally order 2 at a time, & get sent 2 different styles/colors (no solids so far). The only issue may be that you can't choose wide straps vs spaghetti straps."
2,hard to get into and out of,"This suit was hard to get into and out of...the ""cutesy"" hole in the middle of the back not only accentuated portions of my anatomy that should've been covered, but getting in a out was - well, probably amusing if you were watching me, but otherwise uncomfortable. Make sure you get at least 2 sizes larger than your regular clothes size!! Will not be wearing for quite some time (and at least another 20 lbs), if ever."
5,very good deal,"I ordered a grab-bag swimming suit and didn't expect much, but the actual suit really exceeded my expectations. Very nice - and modern - design (black suit with thin yellow straps; on the chest area there are bright colored letters ""love 2 swim"" with a few little hearts around letters). It looks good on me, and for 1/2 price it's a really good deal."
3,Much better than black size on black wrench,"I bought both the metric and SAE T sets and have found them much better than the regular L shaped allen wrenches. After a while you start to remember the size by handle color. The reason for 3 stars is the offshore mainland China quality, (Typical of Grizzly) size indicators arent lined up with wrenches, and really stupid mounting keyholes. Other than that, they work."
1,"Awful, irritating film on every level","The somnambulist shorts of the underground movement could be compared to ""The Eternal Present,"" except that the shorts rarely ran more than 15 minutes and TEP goes feature length. The hero is a dork with a bad haircut who walks around with his mouth open. The jump cuts and eternity of black leader is sure to put you in a bad mood within minutes. In one scene, Our Hero is taking a bus ride, sitting and looking out of the window. This is covered in ten jump cuts and three fades to black! And nothing happens! There may be a plot here, but I am certainly not going to watch it again to find out. The film's credits include the film splicers our Artiste used! Do not buy this film, whatever your curiosity level. It has nothing to do with the plot synopsis offered on this web site."
3,MARDUK'S WARNOGRAPHY ALBUM: PANZER DIVISION,"In comparison to Marduk's previously recording, ""Nightwing"", it appears to me that the follow-up ""Panzer Division..."" falls short of the predecessor's greatness. Granted, ""Panzer Division..."" is composed of consistently faster music, it doesn't achieve the inhumanly fierce brutality and blatantly infernal atmospheres exhibited on ""Nightwing"". The reason can be largely attributed to a moderate alteration in thier riff structures which, in turn yield a more contemporary aura, while on earlier recordings, Marduk compositions tended to utilize noticeably more dark medieval and gloriously grim structures. With all that said, ""Panzer Division.."" is worth one's attention, especially if ferocious speed floats your black metal boat. However, this recording is inferior & shorter than their finest and substantially more satanic output, ""Nightwing""."
2,The Most Unrelenting Album I've Ever Heard,"This is by far the most nihilistic and unrelenting album I've ever heard. It consists of app. 98% blasts beats, no exaggeration. But how is the album itself? Not that great unfortunately. While I wouldn't call the album bad, nothing really stands out. It's pretty much just non-stop blasting and brutality with very little interesting going on. There are certainly some good tracks on this one, but not enough to make it a mandatory album. Pick it up used to hear how audacious it is. Otherwise I recommend Nightwing over this."
1,It's a pretty poor excuse for a musical recording,"Marduk plays brutal fast blackmetal, or so they claim. In actuality, all you hear is senseless grinding, boring riffs and songs which sound the same. By the third song, I was asking myself, where did my money go? If you want quality black metal, go get Dimmu Borgir - melody and aggression combined into a coherent whole, pure aural enjoyment."
2,Fast but Boring,"This is my first Marduk album. Panzer Division Marduk is for those people who like blisteringly fast repetitive music. If you like simple guitar tunes repeated ad infinitum with repetitive drumming, this album is for you.However, if you prefer any variety in the songs in the album, this is about as bad as it gets.The speed and ferocity of the initial listen quickly wears as one proceeds through each track. Vocals and tank cannon blasts are about the only thing which passes muster here. Guitars are boring. Drumming is boringly repetitive. You could take the ""chorus"" of any track and strap it on to any other, and not know the difference! Trust me after the third song, you will probably turn this thing off.I would avoid this one."
3,Black War Metal 100 MPH=Marduk Panzer Division,"This CD is totally intense real Black Metal,played raging fast. It has breakdowns with the guitar riffs and solos occasionaly but for the most part is really fast. Great CD,one of Marduks best. This CD is not for trendy posers into NU-metal ,so I would advise to stay away,but for people into Black Metal and Death Metal,be sure to listen to this CD."
3,Good but not great,"Well apart from alot of cheese, with this album you get an evil (yes sometimes VERY cheesey) sounding, brutal-but-melodic journey into the dark and angry depths of... well something anyway! The cd starts off sounding pretty cheesy but in the end sounds much more evil. The drumming is, yes, anti-aircraft fire and is quite good, the guitarist are pretty damn good as well, vocally its much of the same and the bass mainly follows the guitars.Fairly unoriginal material but still good, a bit of filler but otherwise a good cd, I might go into more detail later, I'm a bit busy now."
4,A Visit to the War of Greek Independence,"Phyllida Vannick and her aunt escape from the Sultan and are rescued by a less than enthusiastic Brett Renshaw. Phyl is looking for her brother, who ran away from America to fight with Lord Byron. Brett, who is heartbroken by a ruthless woman back in England, begins to see Phyl in a new light, but she is enamoured with the Greek pirate captain, Alexandros.This is a typical Jane Aiken Hodge romance- filled with historical background, believable characters and a well developed romance."
3,Helpful!,This textbook is very user friendly and even offers a quiz at the end of each chapter to allow for self checks. It's like all my high school and college writing courses re now making sense and I understand what they mean. The redundancy o important information also helps me get the point.
2,Not impressed.,"I received the book within a few days, but that is about the only thing that has gone well with the purchase. When I opened the tattered paper it was wrapped in I noticed that the book was damaged. I tried to contact the seller about returning the book and still haven't received any feedback."
1,Not generally informative,"This book is directed at personal finances and not, as I had hoped, to more general concerns. It does not resonate at all with previous writing in sociology, systems theory, and complex analysis, as I had hoped and expected."
5,Very nice blanket,"This 100% cotton blanket is very nice and is currently under $10, which is a great deal.I got the green colored one and am very happy with it. The color and design is very nice and you can tell this is a very good quality blanket that will not fall apart or fray in the washing machine.If you can get this while it's on sale, don't hesitate to do so. I would order more blankets from this company."
5,Worth it!,"It was more than I expected. It was easy to hang, looks good, and most of all it is as comfortable as advertised. Too bad I don't have more places to hang more hammocks."
5,Excellent plan for church strategic growth,This book hits on many of the challenges facing particularly main-line churches today and forces churches to ask themselves if they are connecting to their members and the community. I appreciate his easy to read style and explanations for lay people regarding the definition of branding. Very helpful!
5,Clear vision,"Church Marketing 101 is one of the best resources to help you understand how to use marketing in the right ways according to individual needs. Richard's vision through this book, leaves you full of useful information that anyone can put in practice. He gives a realistic approach to understanding branding, and shows you the path to obtain it. Both strategic and an encouraging read."
5,Great Book,"For anyone that are not familiar with markeing concepts, this is the book. It takes you in a markeitng journey to explain how to make your church grow.It is good teory, there are great advices and will help to stablish a ""good"" marketing culture in your church. A must have for those with poor markeitng knowledge.As a portuguese speaking country, I am using it to teach those concepts to our church council, because not everybody will be able to read it."
3,Okay but no real ideas in it!,If you know anything at all about basic marketing do not bother buying this book as it is just redundant to what you already know. I was looking for true ideas and strategies not run of the mill Marketing 101 info. If you know NOTHING about marketing then not a bad buy but even then do not expect any big inspirations.
4,Chemistry Review,"This is a pretty good review of the basics of Chemistry. I'm also reading the Calculus, Physics, and Biology books of this series. They all seem to be good reviews of the basics."
3,Not a bad book,"This is actually not a bad book, the only reason I give three stars is that its meant for students with little or no chemistry background. Its a good book for students of chemistry 101 or maybe even 111.Its clear that the author wrote the book with the student in mind. The author explains the chemistry concepts very well so that even the least chemistry orientated can learn a thing or two."
2,Not Enough,"I am taking the second semester in chemistry. I bought this book with hopes of helping me in my class. There is mostly material in this book pertaining to a first semester course. I regret buying it. However, if we're only concerned with a first semester situation, then this book gets four or five stars."
4,Chemistry Homework Helper,My daughter is just starting advanced chemistry for the first time. The book has help her. I would reccomend this to any chemistry student.
5,Best explanation of concepts for chemistry comprehension!,"I had a very tough time with chem 101 at my college. I bought this book just as an aid based off the other reviews and they were right! I learned more from this book than an entire semester of lectures! And as I continue on to more complex chemistry classes I still refer back to this book as I find it gives the best explanations for the foundations of understanding chemistry, which is essential if you wish to succeed in the science."
3,so so,"Neat idea, throw a ball and instantly see how fast it was going when your buddy caught it. Works on about half the throws."
1,Piece of junk...save your money !,"Someone gave my 8 year old son this ball for Christmas and I must say that it is a complete waste of money. In order for the ball to register an MPH reading, it must be held with a virtual death grip. No one...and I mean not even a major league player can accurately throw a ball with a tight grip. Any player will tell you that a ball is thrown with a light grip. My son's hand is neither big enough or strong enough to make this ball function. I'm sending it back for a refund."
3,It is decent,In order for this ball to work you need to use a two- seam grip. You can not throw a 4 seam fastball.
4,underware,"I'm lockin for sexy underware still I'm not gate what I want I would like to some body share with me to gate what I want, thanks"
3,"gay, see mine","Boy, are these ever HOT...fit and feel great...They show off your cock. from across the room or pool and get you a lot of attention....Recommend you get a size smaller as they will fit tighter and really outline your cock, especially if you are hard....My other half loves them and has to keep an eye on me, especially when others want to feel them, and me...."
2,Cheap Pleather,"I'm a huge Peaches fan, and I wanted to hear Gonzales, so I decided to fork out for this. I don't recommend you do likewise. The first track, 'Red Leather' is definitely the best of the three. The beats are club-ready, even if the lyrics and vocals aren't on point. Tracks 2 and 3 however, are generic and forgettable, compelling me to junk the whole CD. The second track, in particular, is unlistenable, and begs the question, ""What were they thinking?"" Peaches gets sexual on the third track, but it's without her trademark wit and attitude. We already know she's a Jewish Sex Goddess -- so her claims here are extraneous, especially as the music offers nothing. Gonzales isn't particularly interesting either, going by this EP. Avoid."
5,MOLLY MOO COW,"My 15-month old daughter loves this video. Whenever she starts to get cranky, I put this video in & she is mesmerized by the characters. She loves the music and action. And it doesn't hurt that one of her favorite characters is Molly Moo Cow. I would recommend this video to anyone."
1,i dont even have this movie,i just typed a random name and got this i have no idea what its about but it looks stupid......like me
5,Sinatra's Best TV Performance,"This is one of the greatest hour long musical specials ever produced and it is now on DVD. Not only is Sinatra superb, but this is one of the pitiful few on-screen performances of Antonio Carlos Jobim available. Jobim was an amazing composer and performer and his segment, though brief, is worth the price of this disc alone. Ellas singing here reminds us of how truly blessed we were to have her on this planet and how completely musical she was. This is ""historic"" for sure, but don't be fooled.... this is also pure entertainment and a disc you will watch over and over as I have and still do. A joy."
5,Maybe the best entertainment you'll ever see.,Frank and Ella in there prime at there best. It doesn't get any better than this.
4,Ella outshines Frank and Tom.,"Sinatra is a little hokey on this program (a TV special from the mid-60s) but Ella is fantastic. She is her usual awkward self when it comes to making TV banter with Sinatra, but they are great together on their duets. The closing duet on ""Lady is a Tramp"" is th highlight. Tom Jobim is given short shrift and is featured only as an accompanist for Sinatra in a rather short segment."
5,A Show that will Spoil you,"Ella Fitzgerald a Great Great Talent.Jobim Very Talented,then you Have Nelson Riddles Orchestration that is something else.but to top it all off you have the Greatness of Frank Sinatra leading the charge.His Vocals were top notch here&this is one of those Specials that you will be glued to from start to finish.the arrangements are vibing&this is One Groovy Good time."
3,"Nice historical video, poor video and sound quality.","If you're a big fan I think this DVD is great, but to me it doesn't worth the price, I should have bought the VHS and would got the same quality and entertainment or just save the money for a later reissue, this is just a poor raw conversion of the video, no enhancements at all, although it's really nice to see Sinatra, Ella and Jobin I was very dissapointed about the image and sound quality."
2,"Lots of heart, but...","First off, I admire Dave Alvin a great deal. He is in fact one of my musical heroes. Some of the songs he's written are just flat out fantastic. But it isn't just the music. It's the person as well. In the music business, integrity is almost impossible to find. Dave has more integrity in his left pinky than most people do in their whole bodies.That said, Dave isn't really a singer. He works hard at it, but the instrument just isn't there. He does a great job with his own songs. When he starts singing other people's stuff, though, it can get dicey. He's an outstanding producer and the production here is wonderful. But when it all comes down to it, most of the songs on this album need someone with the kind of vocal range Dave doesn't have. I admire him for taking the risk of putting this CD together. I'm sure it was a labor of love. But it's not a pleasing listen for me."
2,very dissapointed,"I've followed Dave since his days with the Blasters, This CD is such a dissapointment. The Only highlight of the CD was Surfer Girl. If you want to try a Dave Alvin solo DVD, try Blackjack David."
2,"bland, faint singing","The music is not bad, but I don't like the voice. The singer is not a singer really..."
5,New Love,I Loved this book. I hope they wright a nother one. But hey!.I hope that the Thoroughbred books don't shut down after book 72.Sign the partishen and save the books. Created by Joanna Campbell.Jamie Smit
3,"Perfect Book For Little Girls Into Horses, But...","This book is a perfect gift for a little girl who is into horses. Proberly also bigger girls, who are into horses will like the book. But I am not a little girl, and I am not into horses, so my enthusiam about the book is so-so. What bothers me about this books is that the characters are too superficially drawn. Otherwise I can say that the book gives a very English feel, that is a UK how it was before, before it was turned into the multicultural UK we know today."
5,oh sweet heaven....,"With a cd like this, you'll soon forget friends and family. Amon tobins ""melody infringement"" has got me in the knees, on the floor, lost forever."
3,I don't get it.,"I just don't get it. I feel like i wasted my money. I was expecting more, perhaps faster or more trance-like. My fault. If you want to listen to Braveheart crossed with Electronica and mixed to sound like angst. Then buy it. It's more like Psychadelic-Hypnotic to me."
2,Lost All Its Heat,"Charles Bullen, multi-instrumentalist and vocalist of the great post-Faust band This Heat, emerged from hiding in 1998 with this oddly un-Heat-like effort. In ways it resembles Bullen's and Williams' 1985 cassette ""Flaming Tunes"" (the ""gentler side of This Heat"") although it is less adventurous and less colorful. One would never connect this music to Heat without the liner notes, sounding like any given random synthesist with a beatbox and some flangers.If internal Heat comes from radioactivity, the ""Internal Clock"" of this one indicates decay to a mere leaden state -- the term ""deservedly obscure"" comes to mind."
3,Top Hat not a snap,"My Top Hat included instructions that were meant for a hardtop for one. Otherwise I didn't know one had to undo the convertible top to secure the rear TH flaps. In kid speak, way not a snap to install. I don't want to undo all that for 9 hours of parked.thanksHap"
3,"Okay, but not great","We have numerous puzzle books, mostly from Usborne. This one is enjoyable (especially for dragon fans!), but not nearly as good as the ""Puzzle X"" books (Puzzle Castle, Puzzle Ocean, etc). There are quite a few pages where you basically have to guess to get the answer rather than solve a puzzle. I suppose those are useful for being a good observer (e.g. when you find Dan's nametag), but our family does not enjoy them as much as the other series."
2,song quality,"First impression is that it didnt take too long to produce this CD, was only one song I liked so I bought it when I saw a good deal on it hoping some other songs would be good as well, nope."
2,Right Films Wrong Music,"While it is a delight to see Buster Keaton and his masterful comic timing, the music chosen for these masterpieces is ALL WRONG! It is truly annoying to have the music from the Douglas Fairbanks' Thief of Bagdad playing while watching The General--where is the Civil War music that went with the film? ( When Johnny Comes Marching Home and Dixie are painfully missing )would it really have been too much to have music that fit with each film? This is enough of an omission to lower my vote to 2 stars."
4,"Keaton, One of the Greats!","I own a few other Buster Keaton sets and I really enjoyed this collection. My favorite Keaton movie is the Cameraman, I think that even though it was made at the time he signed with MGM and his career ended shortly after, it was one of his best. That was the only thing I think this collection was missing, the Cameraman. I pre-ordered this item because where else can you find a set with serveral short films, full length films and bonus features of Keaton for about ten dollars?"
2,"Buster's great, some of the DVDs are busted","You can't go wrong with Buster, but in the set I bought, some of the DVD's won't play on any machine--computer or DVD player. If you get this set, make sure you play through all the DVDs right away to make sure they're not defective."
3,bad music choice,"I liked the fact that this dvd contained many shorts, and later projects I had yet to view. It is a good price for so much stuff, but I did feel it was slightly misleading. On the cover it shows a some pictures of movies that are not even included they are The Navigator, and The Cameraman. When I was reading what was included I stumbled across a title of a short I have never heard before ""Her Painted Hero"" Excited to find a short I never saw before I looked for it right away. I soon discovered Buster never made a short, and I wondered why they would put the title of a film that doesn't even exist. Over all I liked that it had many shorts on here, but some of the music they chose doesn't fit at all."
1,Incorrect Product description,"I will return this item. On the Amazon website, the Product Description lists the contents to include ""Universal AC/DC Power Adapter."" However, it has no such item, and is instead powered by AA batteries."
4,Tea Set Every Child Would Enjoy,I have seen cheaper tea sets made. The decorations make it more eye appealing. Great for 3+ years of age. My granddaughter loved it.
4,Better Patrick effort,This was a better than average stroke book. There were a number of good stories that actually had a plot and were varied and hot. One of the better ones from this prolific and now deceased editor.
2,Description not helpful,"This product and similar others need more descriptive notes such as length in inches. One does not know from this write-up if the spoon is 3 or 15 inches long. These are most likely great products, however, I and probably others need to know more in order to choose."
5,Shiseido Pureness Gel (oil-free)...good stuff for sensitive skin with occasional break outs,"This is an excellent product. Shiseido is discontinuing it, I think, because I simply cannot find it at the dept stores anymore. They've got a similar product now, but it doesnt contain a lot of the same, helpful ingredients.The price is right. It's very good for sensitive skin that gets an occasional break out. I would recommend giving it a try."
3,Good moisturizer for oily skin,"I like the idea of a gel and I like the cooling feel. However, for my normal skin, even in the summer when it tends to get oilier and requires a light moisturizer, this is just not enough moisture for my skin...it feels almost drying. I ended up giving it to my BF who has super oily skin and he loves it! I'll probably get more for him when he's out! But not for me."
1,does not moisturize enough,"I bought this moisturizer for the name brand, as Shisheido is famous for the quality of its products.I was predisposed to like it, however it did not work for me. My skin is oily, but the lotion did not moisturize it enough.I also noticed that after I received it, it only had 3 weeks of life left. That was a major blow.So, half of the product ended up in the garbage can.Will never buy it again."
4,Not quite the same,It's a good product but not as good as the same product manufactured and sold in Japan.
2,Did i hang it wrong???,"I bought mine on Cozumel and hung it when i got home. But when you get into it, it feels like you're lying on a flat board, the sides dont go up around you, and it feels like if you were to turn or shift around, you'd just fall out of it (it's a one person hammock). If I did hang it without doing something additional to it (i just hung it from the loops on the ends), please tell me how to fix it! Thanks!"
4,Great but not plug and play!,"Very comfortable hammock with fine workmanship and vibrant colors. It's worth the money, but it came with no hardware for hanging it. It would have been nice if the hardware was included or if Amazon sells a kit for hanging the hammock, but neither was the case. I had to make a few trips to the hardware store to find the right combination of screws, S-hook, and chains to hang it."
5,Kids love it,"We've had the hammock for a month, now. I hung it between two trees. We use it for relaxing (adults should lie diagonally for the most comfort), and even as a big swing for the kids. We've never tried two adults at a time, but one adult and one kid fit just fine. And, kids can hang onto it easily to be safe while swinging. My daughter loves to pretend she's a butterfly in a chrysalis by wrapping the sides around her. The colors and weave are nice-looking. I'm happy with it!"
1,Not fashion forward,"This book was a disappointment. If you live in New York, London, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago or any other major city, you've already worn most of these styles. The book is a compilation of looks ranging from really bad early 80's wannabe goth, unattractive fetishists, a raver or 2, a couple of neo-hippies, a club kid, a design team who deconstructs then reconstructs garments and two japanese girls who change styles like most people change underwear. It doesn't try to even guess what might new and exciting.The photographs are clear, the print quality is good. The content is a disappointment. Look over this book in a library or something, don't bother buying it."
1,ICK!,This book glorifies the unnescessary and cruel practice of genital cutting. Not suitable for children.
5,Love It,Loved it so much I purchased two. Its a great fit and good price. I would recommend this item and will purchase another if necessary.
2,Poor quality,We received this futon cover. Were able to put the cover on just fine but when we started to zip it the zipper broke. Cheap zipper.
3,futon cover,"Actually Khaki ended up more the color taupe, but the fabric is OK. Looks nice and smooth in the picture, but when in use really loose and untidy looking. Price was super great, however."
3,"Thin, lightweight cover; not very tough","The cover is thin and not very durable. It's not exactly upholstery-grade material. The upside is that it's soft, and would probably feel better under a sheet than a heavier, more durable fabric might. The downside, of course, is that it might not hold up well (mine ripped at the seam when I first installed it). I've not had any other problems with the cover in the 17 odd months I've had it, but then, I've been afraid to try to remove it to wash it, for fear of it ripping more."
2,"Decent farbric, but too tight","To tight for our mattress, ripped when trying to put it on. I think there may be thinner futon mattresses out there, but if you have a thick one, then pass on this product"
4,Brushed Cotton Twill Futon Cover in Khaki,Nice and neutral Look great paired with nice throw pillows in turquoise and brown. Love my design on a dime kinda look!!
4,Good for my needs,"We wanted something comfortable so when the kids had friends to sleep over, we had something presentable, durable, and not too expensive. This fit the bill pretty well. The zippers are not plenty full when you want to wash the covers but with some practice, you get used to it."
4,great cover,I like this cover . The color was richer and better than I expected. The zipper is only on 2 sides but this is not a problem for us. Material seems durable and is of good quality.
3,I the fabric to be thicker :(,"This product gets the job done for now. I will replace it in the future though with a cover that is far more substantial in weight. I let my 2 year have her water cup on the futon in the TV room and I had hoped that this cover would be thick enough that drips would not penetrate the cover. It is really thin. It's almost the same weight as my sheets. My other complaint is that I have to stuff my full-sized 8 in. mattress into the full-sized cover to zipper it shut. It takes some huffing and puffing on my part because the cover is that tight. Also, the cover looks a little more milk chocolatey than it does khaki. For the price, I will keep it for now and budget for one of better quality somewhere down the road."
3,Cover,Gave this to my daughter for Christmas. As with other reviewers she found zippers only on 2 sides and had a difficult time putting it on by herself. Pulled a seam on one side corner. Would recommend that at least two people should install this.
3,Just about average,The futon cover was just about average. I expected the material to be softer and more comfortable for the $$ I was paying. I don't know how long lasting it will be. It's been just 1 day so far. The khaki color is a little duller than it looks in the picture.
3,It started out ok,"It started out beautifully. Got on the futon, looked perfect! Then the puppy got her mouth on a corner of it and now it's in the trash. :("
3,Diferencia de color,El color del producto en realidad es mucho más oscuro que lo que vemos en la fotografía. No es exactamente lo que yo quería.
3,"Love the shoes, sizing was wrong","I love K-Swiss shoes, I've been wearing them for years, I was disappointed that this styles sizes ran small and narrow."
3,felt like I was sent two different sizes,"I know my left foot is a bit bigger than my right but there was a dramatic difference in both shoes. My right foot feels great at the end of the day but the left shoe felt as though the arch was too far forward toward my toes and too tight around the sides. I did not return them because of the hastle of returns and figured my feet will get used to them once they're broken in, I hope."
2,Didn't care for it.,"I'm an overweight 48 year old female & I found this dvd hard to follow. She didn't stick with one movement long enough for me to catch on to the steps. Maybe as I continue to use the dvd I'll get the step before she moves on to another but at this point, I'd rather put in a different dvd which I can actually work out with. I would not purchase this product again, nor will I try any of her other dvd's."
5,Really fun workout,"I was skeptical about this one...in my experience, workout DVDs that feature any sort of hip-hop dance are typically cheesy and corny. This one was actually very fun, and keeps you moving the entire time, ensuring you work up a nice sweat. The instructor is fun, bubbly (but not too much so), and great at cuing. If you dread cardio, want something to mix up your workout routine, or simply like dancing, this DVD is worth a try."
2,Way too Short!,"I bought this DVD because of all of the good reviews I read here on Amazon.com. I was disappointed. The workout is only 30 minutes and couple that with the low intensity and I don't think it's worth the money.So I'm not totally negative, I will say that it is fun and well instructed but I'm definietly going to have to combine this with other DVD's to get a good workout."
4,Happily surprised!!,"When my daughter(who does alot of dance/exercise classes) gave me this DVD for Christmas I wasn't sure I would be able to follow along with a Crunch Dance Workout. I was happily surprised. Marie really goes through each series of steps at a doable pace while you get the hang of it, then picks up the tempo once you've been over the steps a couple times. It is really fun. It really makes you feel like a dancer, and,it's a great alternative than just doing cardio work on a treadmill. Also, the time, 39 minutes, can easily fit into your daily schedule."
4,Funky and fun!,"I had a hard time finding a workout video but finally decided on this one because of the words ""cardio"" and ""dance"" which sounded like a good combination.The dances themselves are actually fun to do, although there is very little description of the moves before hand and it took me a while to get them figured out (usually around the time they were moving on to a new dance) but the changing of the dance themes really makes the time fly by. The music was fun but stayed pleasantly in the background. (I hate being overwhelmed by overpowering soundtracks)I didn't feel the usual awkwardness about trying these moves out, it felt more like a night with the girls than a workout. My heart rate elevated pretty quickly but the marching in place helped keep me from getting overwhelmed too quickly. I like this enough to seek out the Fat Burning Dance Party to add to my collection."
2,Beginner Cardio but heavy on the dance moves,"I find that I am slow to work up a sweat with Cardio Dance Blast. I am learning some new dance moves though! Once you get the dance steps down you can get the movement going better. I am not a 'dancer' so for me the dance moves are a challenge to follow. The up side is the 20 mins goes real fast, you have a bit of fun with it, but I find I get a better cardio workout with traditional exercises lunges, squats, jumps etc.. This dvd is ok if you are bored with your current exercise routine and want to mix things up a little, but definitely not a dvd I would use as my primary resource to be (or get) fit. I would consider this a light cardio workout. Probably better for beginners."
5,Fun Light to Intermediate Workout,"This is a great workout if you only want about 30 minutes. It is a fun dance workout, you don't even realize you are working out, I would highly recommend this DVD if you like an easy to follow dance workout!"
4,Very fun exercise DVD,"This music is not very current, but the dances are fun and moderately challenging. You will get a nice workout if you use this DVD and it's really fun."
4,Very Fun!,"This was my first dance workout video and I found it very fun and entertaining! Its really great to get yourself moving, although I dont think its very strenuous. I do it almost every morning and it wakes me up in a good mood!"
4,Very enjoyable,I liked this video. The hip hop coreography is fun and allows you to follow instruction well. It has continuos movements wich lets you break a small sweat and has good music.
3,Dancey - slightly repititious...,"Pretty good, definitely worked my hips/thighs. Takes a little while to get the steps, but not bad. Each segment is a different dance, but each dance is done the same. You learn a step, add a step, do them together, then run through the whole thing, then double time, then each step individually again for all the dances. I like that some of the girls in this video aren't already in tip top shape so it makes me think I can do it too. I don't think I'll be doing the whole video through again, definitely will have to do it in segments to break up the monotony."
1,for those with excellent coordination only,"this work out is poorly designed because the instructor (who could clearly be a professional dancer) spends almost no time teaching you how to do somewhat complicated moves. she'll break the move down initially and repeat it about two times before bringing it up to full speed and adding in arm movements. i'm not the best dancer in the world and was looking for a good work out with some dance tecniques to boot. well, this was not it. so unless you already are an accomplished dancer, this dvd will just make you feel pathetic and frustrated."
3,It's alright..,"This DVD is better than the Prevention DANCE YOURSELF THIN in which Marie Forleo is also the instructor but honestly, I wouldn't waste my money if I were you! If you want a good instructional DVD, buy 10 Minute Solution Fat Blasting Dance Mix with Jennifer Galardi. You will love it, I give it 5 stars..Jennifer is AWESOME!"
2,A little to 'hip' for me...,"This video was not for me. I like really fast paced workouts. This felt slow to me, too much rolling of the hips and flinging of the arms to really get going on your feet. The instructor annoyed me as well, and I couldn't focus."
3,A fun way to exercise!,This is very low cardio easy to follow dance routine. My 9 year old daughter and I enjoy dancing to this tape together.
4,Great workout for beginners,I was looking for something a bit more intense but this workout is great for beginners. She gives great instruction and the routines are easy to learn.
3,Somewhat Awkward,I have many years of different types of dance experience and I found this DVD a bit strange. I was not a fan of the instructor's style and the moves didn't seem to flow well together. But it did get me sweating so I gave it 3 stars for that reason. I would not recommend this to someone without a dance background.
2,Yuck,"I didn't care for this DVD. First, it's too fast -- even the instructional part. I also found it too complicated to remember all the steps."
1,Not good!!,"It was really hard to follow and it just frustrated me! I dont recommend this to anybody ;( it was a waste of money in my view,not worth buying!"
5,Not too shabby.,I bought this for my mom. It came quickly and she liked it. Now I need that 'insanity' work out thing.
1,Very frustrating and annoying!,"This is the worst piece of junk I've ever seen. The moves are not ever given a thorough demonstration - you're on your own to try to keep up. Jennifer Galardi's Dance Party (also a Crunch product) is FAR superior! She knows how to give you the moves by going slowly the first time through, and then repeating the routines so that you know what you're doing, and not just flailing around half-baked. I stopped this DVD after the first 10 minutes, and said ""Enough is enough!"" I'm glad I tried out the DVD from the library, so that I didn't waste any money on this DVD!!! Thank you, public library!"
1,You must be kidding,"I have learned my lesson........I will not buy another workout dvd without reading the reviews first. I tried this dvd this morning and the only reason it is still on the shelf is because I am struggling with throwing it away and ""wasting"" the money. In the end it will be in the garbage - while the video is broken down into different segments the moves are not easy to learn and then she is on to the next thing. In addition to not ""getting"" the moves I didn't raise my heart rate at all. I felt like I should put in one of my other dvd's and start over."
4,An entertaining and fun workout!,"My friend let me borrow her copy and I love it. Some of the moves are a bit awkward (and you can't help but laugh) but you really feel the burn when doing it. I enjoyed working out to it, which is saying a lot because I hate to work out and have never had fun doing a workout video. The only fault I found was if you're not used to the dance steps it takes a few times doing it to be able to keep up."
2,boring,"I wanted a change from kickboxing all the time so I thought ""hey dancing"" hopefully it's like Jazzercise(which I loved), well it's not. She went to fast and I couldn't keep up. I think I am coordinated, I used to dance...25 years ago (I'm 40!!yeah!!) This was NOT for me."
4,"Well, I thought it was fun...","If you are looking for a hard-core sweaty workout until you drop video, this is probably not the one. If you like to dance and you need something to motivate you to move, this is a good one. I didn't find the choreography hard to pick up on. And I worked up a good sweat. With the CRUNCH dance videos, I find the more you put into it, the more you get out of it. It's a good diversion from step and typical aerobics and kickboxing for cardio."
3,difficult to follow,"the steps are hard for non dancers, it took me 3 times before i can follow the moves. bought the tape last year but only use it less than 10 times, it gets boring after a while."
1,Quite crap really,"The video isn't really what I would call ""Cardio"", rather a series of jogging on the spot, bottom wiggling & arm waving. Didn't challenge me at all & wasn't tired at the end."
1,NOT DANCING,"If you are looking to get some cardio activity from dance keep looking. If you try any of these moves in a club prepare to never be let in again! This video is is the same old cheesey aerobics routines only with the participants wearing ""club"" clothing instead of spandex. I was very disappointed with this purchase."
1,Use at your own risk!,"Despite the instructor's professional appearance, the workout appears dangerous! If you blink, you might miss the warmup. This is followed by complex, frustrating routines for which no guidance is given to personal safety (i.e. injury prevention). I consider myself an intermediate-advanced level fitness participant. Yet I couldn't adequately follow the routines. Worse, I was concerned I'd be out-of-comission for alternative workouts after trying to complete some of the moves. Find yourself something less challenging/frustrating to follow that's a lot safer! Note: if you have a GREAT deal of prior experience with dance, then you may enjoy this tape."
3,Poems of Divorce,"A very interesting book, it actually looks into the mind of someone going through a divorce after a failed marriage, after reading ""If men loved their wives the way they love their children, all women would want to be married"",No, as a woman, I want my husband to love me as a wife, not the same way he loves the children. I can see now why the marriage failed,I wish I could ask the ex-wife if she ever felt like she was being treated like one of the children, since love between two adults is totally different from the love you feel for your children. If he hasn't already, I think the author should seek some counseling."
3,Poems of Divorce,I thought it was a good book and had some very interesting things to think about. I felt it let you have insight into what the author is feeling. I enjoyed reading it.
3,Theories,"The book is lengthy, but it isn't a real difficult read. The problem I have is that Amazon said I needed to buy it new because a used book would not have the CD or the activities in the back of the book. I bought it new and there is no CD with this book. I have purchased from Amazon in the past (used books) and have never seen that warning so I didn't think it was there regular disclaimer. So be aware that you may get that disclaimer, it doesn't mean there is a CD at all. I spent an extra $40 for a CD that didn't even exist."
5,Awesome!!!,I had absolutely no problems getting my book on time! I really look forward to doing business with this company again.
1,poorly designed clipper,"I own, use and enjoy many Corona products, but this one is poorly designed. I bought it to prune a bunch of cedars and junipers. I received it one day and unpackaged it to go out and start pruning. I was not trying to cut any limbs larger than it was rated for and I was not trying to cut any dead wood. From the first cut I noticed that it took much more force to cut than my other Corona loppers and then on the fourth cut one handle snapped in two and I am not a particularly strong person. I returned the shears the next day to Amazon with no problems. I have since noticed that my local orchard supply store carries a large number of Corona products, but they do not carry this shear."
2,"3 "" loppers","these loppers did not preform well at all, when tried to cut a 3"" treecould not cut at all. Handles seemed to want to break instead of cut limb.It also requires a tremendous amount of stregnth to operate loppers.preformance ratings of 1 to 10, I give them a three. Needless to say, I returned item."
5,For collectors of Little-known Soul,"Mighty good stuff here from the vaults of motown. I could go on all day about the wonderful tunes that somehow were not released a the time (except from an album cut by Jr. Walker's All Stars). Stevie Wonder fans will not only get a kick out of the previously unreleased Stevie track (with some nice wheezy harmonica to add to the proceedings), but also of Tammi Terrell's 1965 version of Stevie's 1980 hit ""All I Do."" An obscure group called the Fantastic Four try their hand at ""If This World Were Mine."" Earl Van Dyke does an organ-driven instrumental of ""He Was Really Saying Something."" A really nice number is Jimmy Ruffin's ""On The Avenue,"" (1965), a celebratory look at life in Detroit's ghettos some two years prior to the riots (similar in theme to Gene Chandler's ""Gonna Be Good Times"" from about the same time).In either case, collectors and Motown fans rejoice and buy it."
5,TOTALLY CLASSIC MOTOWN!!!,"AS A CHILD OF THE 60'S, I LOVED ANYTHING MOTOWN FROM THE BEGINNING-I COLLECTED OBSCURE 45'S BY BARBARA, KIM, ETC. AND THOUGHT I HAD MOST OF THE GREAT HIDDEN GEMS UNTIL THIS COLLECTION CAME ALONG!! WHAT A COMPLETE GOLDMINE!! THIS 2CD SET HAS STAYED ON MY CD CHANGER IN MY CAR FOR THE PAST 6 MONTHS AND I CANNOT GET ENOUGH OF IT! MARVINS BALLAD IS ACHINGLY SOULFUL,KIM'S SONG IS A SMOOTH SOUL CLASSIC, BRENDA'S TUNES COULD HAVE ALL BEEN HITS,BARBARA MC WOULD HAVE HAD ONE OF MOTOWN'S BIGGEST WITH BABY A GO GO, THE LEWIS SISTERS ARE TOTALLY MESMORISING,GLADYS WOULD HAVE HAD SEVERAL HITS MORE AND CHRIS CLARK ALONG WITH THE CONTOURS WOULD HAVE BEEN HOUSEHOLD NAMES!! THIS SET OF RARE MOTOWN GROOVES IS A MUST FOR ANYONE WHO HAS EVER ENJOYED ANY OF THESE GREAT MOTOWN ARTISTS! MARTHA'S SONG IS A REAL MOTOWN COOKER ALSO! DON'T MISS THIS WONDERFUL SET!!!!!"
3,Sure isn't only a little bit of fun,"I bought this when I was having a search around in Tower Records. They were playing this and I was hooked by how catchy it was. Songs played on Atari computers - fantastic! Admittedly you have to be in a fun mood to listen to these. None of it is to be taken seriously - as if you can take the lyrics "" Ich singe keine melodien Ich singe eins zwei drei vier, "" serious literally translated "" I sing no melody I sing 1, 2, 3, 4 ""Have fun and remember it's nothing serious"
1,Very disappointing!,"I hat to say it but this album is very disappointing. Jeans Team is a German band from Berlin, and I had heard some of their songs on various compilations before - which is why got excited about finally getting a full album. And it's a big disappointment. I am a big fan of various electronic music groups and musicians but what one is getting here is plain boring. I don't really what else to say about the album. None of the tracks sticks out as being nice. I can't even remember any of the songs although I listened to the album several times. Save your money and get yourself some nice electronica!"
4,Only for the serious,"This video gives a very good ""sense"" of C.G. Jung and is based on a filmed interview with him. It is just as the title says, ""in his own words."" It is excellent for anyone who has a serious interest in C.G. Jung or who is a serious student of Psychology. I will use it in the History of Psychology class that I teach for Psychology majors at the university where I work. The DVD is well made and includes interviews with other important followers of Jung. It is excellent historical footage."
2,Very disappointing,I expected quality similar to A&E's biography of Freud (which changed my perspective on Freud). I am hoping that A&E has a biography on Jung of similar quality.
4,Saws well,"I've had to remove 13 old shrubs, 7 of which were in a tight space between a fence and concrete. The root saw made cutting the roots much easier and because of it's compact size I was able to get into tight areas. The only problem I had was not with the saw, but with the shipping. It took over 2 weeks to get from NJ to NY."
2,biggest waste of money,"this is a terrible vacuum. It's only task in life is to vac a carpet in my office that is about 10x7. It constantly spits the sand back out at my feet instead of actually sucking it into the vacuum. I've used many vacuums in my life and am horrified at how poor this one was, right out of the box."
1,Sets a record for how quickly I returned a product!,"I was in a jam. My work vacuum failed, and I needed something FAST. I snagged one of these and away I went. Within 24 hours, back I came!Pros:* Comes fully assembled* Nicely balanced* Folding handle - easy to store* Good suctionCons:* THE DIRT GOES RIGHT TO THE FILTER! (no, my caps lock is not stuck)* The dirt goes right to the filter!* Did I say the dirt goes right to the filter?* Short power cord.I was dumbfounded. In the filter chamber, dust and dirt filled the area around the filter, and the canister was nearly EMPTY. Hoover blew it first time out with bagless and their tall side-by-side filter/canister system, then blew it again with their Fusion series cone/cyclonic design (which I deal with daily) - and now they are at strike 3 with this design. I give up on Hoover. Recommend to a friend? I don't hate anyone that much!"
2,Returning it,"As much as I like the appearance and the foldaway handle, I really don't like this vacuum very much. The one I bought blows dirt out the back near the carpeting and is quite noisy. I will be returning it for a different model."
4,Hentai and comedy,"If you are satisfied with hentai that only shows raw sex, there are hundreds of titles you can get. But if you want likeable characters, some story building, fun gags and the best (and credible) sex scenes in japanese comics, Slut Girl is your choice.Her you'll find a protaginist girl who doesn't like every thing that is done to her, a protagonist boy who is not that well endowed, and plenty of comedy situations. The only discouraging thing I found is that I found Sayako Bizen, the lead of the title, too much of an abusive woman, though clever and cool.Anyway, ""Slut girl"" is as good as hentai gets."
4,Beginning of a New Adventure of the Third Series,"In the Third Series of STAR BLAZERS, the Earth would be involved in a galactic war between two superpowers: the Galman Empire and the Bolar Federation.This volume introduces two new characters and gives some scenes of pitched space battles between the galactic powers.According to the package, this third series was broadcast in only a few cities in the US. If you enjoyed the previous series, I'm sure you'll find this new series exciting enough."
2,Too much like Dance and it has words.,Diddnt' like it too much money would of paid 3 cents for it and thats about it
1,Waste of Money!,"This ritual was horrible! Someone tok a rit and made copies of the pages (by the way, there are only 13) and filled the rest of it with irrelevant pictures."
2,not a very good camera!,"Las fotos son buenas, pero la camara es lenta y las baterias se agotan enseguida. salvo esto la camara no esta mal por el precio."
3,Good camera for $105,Have used this camera for almost 2 years and have to say it does have some faults. Low light pictures without the flash take long to focus and look like orange film was used. Many times it won't focus taking regular pictures. And will blur a whole range if you don't use manual focus or change focus setting. Otherwise it works like an average camera. Although My Sony Mavica takes pictures as well as this one in 640 resolution and it's 7/8 years oid. Plus I paid $600 for it.
3,Good,"This book is a serious look at how belief affects behavior. Buckman shows that the brain's right temporal lobe is sensitive to varying degrees in different subjects and produces religious esperiences. The core idea is that humans have in varying degrees an instinct to believe in myths. This is primarily a book of anthropology, neuroscience and psychology, not meta-ethics. The author argues in the last two chapters for a ""yes"" answer to the question posed by the title. The book is well-written and easy to understand."
5,A Great CD,"Bon Jovi continues their run of high-energy, hard-driving rock and roll with this great disc. Containing the arena hits ""Bad Medicine"" and ""Lay Your Hands on Me"", this disc has something for everyone.Jon and his great band shine on the ballads ""Living in Sin"" and ""I'll Be There For You"", while rockers will appreciate ""Blood on Blood"", a song about three best friends growing into adulthood, and the bluesy ""Love For Sale"".Each song on this cd is excellent and is full of Bon Jovi's teriffic vocals, energy, and insturmentals. I give this disc my highest recommendation. Play this disc and hear one of the 80's top bands perform some of their best songs."
3,It was cute.........,"It was a quick read. It was cute, I guess. If I was you, I'd see about barrowing it from a friend before you buy it."
4,Offers opportunity for personal insight,"This book is not what I expected, yet I appreciate its contribution to the literature on this topic.Twenty biographical accounts are arranged chronologically. Each offers basic facts about the life and accomplishments of the individual, and includes accounts of their behaviors, their own views of their challenges and accomplishments as well as the perceptions of their contemporaries.Taken together, these twenty biographies offer me insights into human diversity and the importance of accepting ourselves and others for our strengths as well as our idiosyncrasies. As a teacher it helps me both understand and appreciate unique children."
2,cute book- cheaply made paper punchers,"I was excited to get this books since I am an art teacher and know my kids would love it! Unfortunately, the punchers hardly went through a piece of notebook paper, much less anything thicker. One of the puncheers actually got stuck and it took quite a bit of work to get it open again! The book was really cute, but I was so disappointed with the punchers that I had to send it back."
5,Paper Punch Art: Create over 200 Easy Designs with the Punch,I was very excited to get this book. I was hoping for some cute ideas to work on my scrapbook and art and craft ideas. They included the punches which helps to make the different designs they show in the book. It is very easy and there are alot fun ideas. I'm going to use some of the ideas when I volunteer in my son 1st grade class.
4,Product great as advertised,Product arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Happy to recommend Amazon as a place to purchase from.
4,Deceptively big,"Don't be fooled by the description ""Small Pouch."" This pouch holds my Nikon 18-200mm lens without any trouble. Pleasantly surprised."
4,Bigger than expected,I was looking for a small neoprene pouch for my point and shoot digital camera. I thought by the description (Small) that this would fit the bill. Unfortunately it was much bigger than I expected. It is still a nice bag but if you are looking for a small camera pouch that will fit in your pocket then you should look elsewhere.
4,Colors Please...,"Product is nice, well made, and for my purposes it meets all my needs. My only wish is that the colors were available on Amazon."
4,I like The Hushdrops Version Better,Too Bad that John San Juan didn't write all the Webb's material for their record. Summer people is a great song! The Webb's just watered down the Hushdrops Version of this independent classic.The other songs are OK...
5,Great deal from a true bargain queen!,"I searched many sites to find an affordable hammock that was also durable. I was replacing a hammock that was brought back from Panama, and wanted equal craftsmanship, not the uncomfortable & awkward braided type. Most others I saw were $60 - $160. This hammock is perfect for lazing around off my back porch. My 3 year old won't stay out of it! You didn't have it in stock for Mother's Day, so I kept it for myself when it did finally come in. Thanks again for one of life's simple pleasures that us parents seems to miss out on ~ relaxation!"
2,"A confining, uncomfortable hammock","This hammock made you feel as if you were laying in a MRI tube. It curled up around your body, firmly squeezing your arms to your body. I can't wait to return this item. I guess it was due to the hammock not having any slats at the head and foot areas. We have learned a lesson!! The quality appeared to be very good.We were so looking forward to relaxing in our new hammock. This was a big dissappointment."
5,A necessity for our son with Autism!,"I recently purchased my second hammock for my son. He has Autism, and spends a tremendous amount of time in his hammock. His hammock is a staple of his home sensory integration therapy. We hang it from the ceiling with both ends together, suspended from a single hook. (Think of a cocoon!) We had our first one for three years and washed it in the washing machine several times, (it washes beautifully, and will shrink the fibers back to their original strength.) Unfortunately, we had a bad accident with a grape popsicle, and it was time for a new one. So, we bought the same one as a replacement. One tip: for kids, I recommend taking the fringe off, since fingers and toes can get caught in it. Enjoy!"
2,"Not comfortable, doesn't hold up to weather...","Hammock is ok quality, and a decent price, but it isn't the most comfortable. You feel like you're slumped into a sling, and you need large trees or posts to tie it to. If you want a comfortable hammock, or you want to use a stand, get hammock with wood bars. I bought one from ExoticHammocks for about $50 and gave away my Amazona. Also, look for a hammock with nylon or polyester. Cotton hammocks rot and fade."
5,Great Puppet,"It really sounds like a crow! Very animated face and body. Everyone, including my daughter, laughs and laughs."
5,Very happy with cookbook!,"This book was a request from my 28 yr old daughter. I sent it to her for Valentine's Day, and she told me she tried a recipe just tonight and it was FABULOUS! She said it was a rather labor-intensive recipe and that she will probably modify it to make it quicker. This is what she usually does...but she was thrilled with the photos AND the recipes. A+++ and fast shipping."
1,Terrible!,"This is essentially a text book.The level of writing makes it appear that this book is intended for the instruction of adolescents, and considering the rather recent date of publication they would have to be remarkably atypically ""innocent"" for this day and age. The questions intended to stimulate discussion are embarrassingly simpleminded in many cases. It is difficult to imagine that this book wouldn't be laughed out of the classroom by most of today's students.An appendix in the back of the book contain an acceptable translation of the Latin lyrics by someone other than the author. However, the body of the book contains the author's renderings of the Latin poems as well as her comments. What she has done to the poems is a travesty - even as ""free"" renderings they go way beyond what is acceptable in giving an unfamiliar audience an understanding of the originals.This has almost nothing to recommend it - there are many that are better."
5,Well written and informative,"I read the resource kit, wrestled with XP on a handful of computers at work and at home, and then read this book before signing up for exam 270. I passed it easily. I've read several other readiness reviews from MSpress and they all follow a similar format, I wasn't expecting to get everything I needed to know about being a Windows XP guru, but it gave me good guidance for the test. It was lot more readable than most MSPress books with scores of sample exam questions."
1,700+ pages of stuff you already know,"This guide was the first I found on XP. If you haven't certified on a fairly recent MS OS, this might be of use to you, but do not stop with this book. If really just scratches the surface. Most of the topics covered in the book (it does cover the objectives in a superficial way) are things the 70-270 test takes for granted you know. If you are 2000 certified, you want something else more geared to the specific differences between XP and 2000. The guide does include specific additional reading, usually from the Resource Kit or the Knowledge Base, and many hands-on lab setups (you need a 2 or 3 pc network, with 2000 Server on one). Bottom line, I do not feel this is a very good book by itself for any experience level."
3,A rather insipid volume of the series,"Homer meets a girl. The Argo takes off to space. Wildstar trains the recruits.If your budget is tight, you can just skip this volume to proceed to volume 29."
4,Super Reader,"This one was as good as Last Son of Krypton, even if in a different way. The characterisations of Luthor and Superman were done in the same way, even if, due to the nature of the antagonist here, there was not the same amount of byplay between the two old foes. The plot centres around a time travelling post graduate history student, coming back to find out the events surrounding what they call Miracle Monday."
4,NBA STREET FOR THE PS3,"This game was not really what I expected. The original ones are better. This game isnt that bad, but you cant beat the original. I am glad I picked this game up, especially for the price I got it for."
3,PS3 NBA Street HomeCourt,It's a good play. Moves are a little hard to master. Speed is a bit slow and it takes some time to build up your skill levels for you attributes. Still enjoyable to play and not made I purchased it.
3,Poor game balance,"I am not going to talk about what should be obvious or something that has already been mentioned.I will give my reason as to why I can't enjoy this game. There is no balance between the inside game (dunks) vs. the outside game (3 pointers).Sure, we all love dunks too but I got pretty bored with the unrealistic dunks rather quickly and this is where I wish there was some balance to the game. EA made shot blocking so easy that 99% of jump shots can be goaltended. Again, I understand this is not a sim but some balanced gameplay would have meant much better game play."
2,Not as good as the others,"I have to admit, this is the worst streets yet. I dont think this game was worth the $9 I spent on it. Alot of good deep poetry and vibing soulful Hip Hop; but if your not buying it for that, I suggest sticking with the classics. Thanx for reading."
3,street homecourt,game play is great with another person. with the computer it's just the same thing over and over again
1,G A R B A G E,What a waste.... I really wanted to like this game. I played and enjoyed very much all the NBA streets especially2 this isnt anything like that. I didnt even know this came out and i wish i still hadnt. Its not fun and its nothing like before . DONT BUY IT
4,Still Good,"After all these years, this is still a great game. Roster is a little dated now but that doesn't stop it from being enjoyable with a group of friends. For the price you can find it for now, a great buy!"
3,Small and cheap but effective,"These are about 3-4 inches long and work fine but are nothing fancy. There are no labels or markings. If that's what you're looking for, these will do."
2,Lotsa Room For Improvement,"After looking at the track listing I ordered this disc with high hopes. Unfortunately, this CD is full of several live versions and almost unrecognizable remakes of original songs. Some versions are almost laughably lame, perhaps on purpose. If K-Tel wants to sell more albums, they need to get back to basics. Put the original versions (at least the radio edits) on your compilations!"
2,complicated,"It might be my computer, but I wasn't able to get it to work. Apparently it is not windows vista compatible. Thank you, Beth Jones"
2,Software not included,"I did not buy this product intentionally. I was in a major chain store and it was on clearance, so I thought it would be a great Mother's Day Gift. The packaging was impressive as to what you could do for around ten bucks. When I opened it to start my project the software was not included. I double checked the package and it did state the software was supposed to be there. There was no evidence that the package had been opened and it was clearly sealed by the factory. I remembered that in the store there were about 10 kits on clearance, so beware I guess that the software is in the package! I plan to contact the company to see if they can send me the disk. The paper and covering appears to be of high quality."
5,To find that part of each of us that wanted to be a cowboy,"I took my wife on a whirlwind vacation of Montana in 1996. One of our stops was the annual Cowboy Poetry Reading in Lewistown. Paul was there to recite ""Rosined-Up-'n'-Itchin'-to-Git"" and ""Monte Carlo Express-Box 258, 15.3 Miles Home."" Afterwards I had the great pleasure of meeting him and shaking his hand. I was so impressed by his ability to describe his feelings for the West and for his own personal experiences that I wanted to read more, and was able to find copies of his Roughstock Sonnets and I Am Not A Cowboy. Everything about this man tells you what it's like to live life to the fullest, from the bare-back of a bucking horse. Thank God there are still cowboys among us."
2,"Not as pictured , very tacky","WOW, I just received this and it is such a let down. It doesn't look anything like the picture. Not even close. In the picture and the picture on the box it came in, the background looks so nice and light like real compacted dessert like sand...HUH !!! NOT SO. You can see the black foam throughout. It's basically black foam that looks like someone dabbed GOLD paint with a sponge only on the pertruding parts.That's right...GOLD PAINT. Not only is it ugly but a piece of the foam was missing and I found it in the box. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP You get what you pay for. I wish I'd ordered the more expensive rock cliff background for twice as much but I'll just save for it and it'll be my next purchase later on. UUUGGGHHH !! I WISH IT LOOKED LIKE THE PICTURE."
3,So so,It doesn't look anything like the picture above! The size and dementions were completely off! I still kept it bit I had to make some adjustments so that it fit my tank!Theaterial is no good and the color is off!
2,"Not as pictured, not as described, but looks okay..","Ordered two of these to put in my 55 gallon tank. Even with two pieces it falls short. The description says 24x18, but they are really only 23x17 at the most. So I'm not sure what I'm going to do about the extra inches it doesn't cover...I'm not sure how to install it with all the extra space. It also doesn't look exactly like the pictures, the color is a little different. It still looks good, just a darker brown. For being made out of styrofoam it looks decent. If it was the right size I would have given it more stars."
2,crossdressing female outlaws,The collective cowgirls in their black cowboy clothes looked great. Claudia Cardinale's cowboy outfit was not as sexy.The plot was predictable and the acting was fair.Alot more thoughtful script writing and better direction would have gone a long way in this film.
2,Rather inane comedy western,"Despite the best efforts of the leading ladies, Bardot and Cardinale, this movie is simply too inane to be taken seriously. Of course, I tend to find most comedy westerns including Cat Ballou not genuinely funny. Viva Maria, another Bardot movie, is an exception and is a far better movie than this one.Bardot and Cardinale are antagonists. These two ladies develop a growing dislike for each other. At one point, Bardot points out that 'she is starting to annoy me' as Cardinale interrupts her and her sisters while they bath nude in a stream. Their dislike culminates in a fist fight which ends in a draw as both succumb to exhaustion.In the end, however, Bardot and Cardinale emerge as not just friends but as partners as they jump on a train and free their siblings from the hands of the law. All very silly.Some my conclude that Bardot has lost some of her beauty but it appears what she really has lost is too much weight."
2,Better Homes and Gardens Home Designer 6.0,"I expected it to be much better than the much cheaper 3DHome Architect from the same software developers but it was not. I am now I am stuck with it. Should be $39.95 and not $99.00. I bought it thinking that it was more like the Home Designer Pro, which I bought a previous version of it 4 years ago but they don't support any longer."
3,Not for me,"I am 35 and I am a very active person, this DVD has great music, much slower movement, it only make me felling asleep. haha.I think for elder people or someone has really bad problem on their back,this one will be great to start with. but it is not for me."
1,too slow... too instructional...,If you like a workout video that flows and works - this is not for you. good for beginners who knows nothing about pilates.
1,main problem is the card stock,"I bought a Gilded tarot a few years ago. After just a few uses, the black borders already started to fray. I believe that is what everyone is complaining about. A few years later, I decided to buy a deck again, but just for collecting purposes... even just looking at the freaking cards makes the borders fray, so I decided to just use the cards until the die out on me which won't take long. I'm guessing the other decks Ciro makes are the same, based on the similar reviews on his other products. Such great art but whyyyyy with the crappy card material? At least create the material to make it last long for crying out loud."
2,The new print is very bad!,I bought the premier edition of this deck 4 years ago...it was excelent..now they changed the print..the paper is very thin..i am very disapointed..i don't recomend this deck to people that like to use your decks too much.
3,nice art work flimsy cards,"the art work is beautiful. the book is well written BUT, the cards are on flimsy card stock and the size is shorter than other standard tarot decks but not much. it is a nice deck for collecting purposes."
5,Excellent,"Great cards, loved them. The art work on the cards is very lively. Great explanations in the book too which makes it appropriate for beginners."
3,Picard Raises His Head!,"Like many Mediteranean European Tarot artists and creators, Marchetti has reversed the elemental attributes of Cups and Swords- it is obvious Swords are Water, and Cups are Air (just check out the color assignment). This smacks of the philosophy of little-known French occultist Eudes Picard, a Parisian hermetician enjoying occult France during the late 1800's-early 1900's. I own many decks from the Mediteranean continental locale that employ this switch. It is indeed a fascinating study as to why. Kudos to Mr. Marchetti for raising the bar on Tarot artwork in a way not seen before, and probably having the best selling deck since the RWS. In the same vein, I find the accompanying literature and the cards to be lacking in depth."
4,Beautiful,The artwork on these cards is beautiful. The cards are not really heavy. Can actually shuffle them. Images and book accurate.
2,Uninspiring,"I made a mistake when I bought this book. I wanted a book and DECK. I've done this before and accepted my mistake bc there were very nice, colored reproductions of the cards in the book. Not so with this one. The explanations of the cards were ho-hum. I guess I am spoiled by the thoughtful and deep writing of Rachel Pollack's ""Shining Tribe"" deck and her other Tarot books. I eventually returned this book bc I saw no value in having it."
4,Great deck of tarot cards,"Very easy to begin and start reading. Im new to the whole tarot thing, but I enjoy this deck."
2,Another craptacular deck from Lllewelyn,"All I ever hear about this deck is how beautiful it is and blah blah blah. Please. This is just another RWS clone. Great for beginners, but not for people who are looking to add something more original to their Tarot collections.The overall artwork is okay, but my biggest beef is with some of the minors with people being depicted in it (esp. the court cards). This is a CG deck, right? While the Majors are well put together, some of the faces on the characters in the minors do not look like they've been digitally rendered. In some cases they look like they've been cut and pasted onto the bodies. I find that rather half-@$$ed. If you're going to make a CG deck with digitally rendered people, why not go the whole way?I stear clear of Llewelyn's stuff (with the exception of some of the decks from Lo Scarabeo) because they seem to produce a lot of products that are either rehash the same crap from most other books or have no meaning whatsoever. Buyer beware."
3,I Shopped the Sheriff,"I have this deck when a friend left it at my house and never reclaimed it. It's got some interesting visual points, but some of the faces look like the artist or edior pasted some of their friends' faces onto otherwise decent drawings - the head is angled one way and the face is looking a bit the other way and it's blurrier than the rest. The overall theme to me screams ""Lookit me, I'm 15 and just discovered paganism and fantasy novels.""However, I have to say that ""The Lovers"" card in this deck is one of my favorite pieces of artwork, period."
3,"Beautiful, but...","I was given this deck & book as a birthday gift by my mother. It's visually stunning but I don't have anything else positive to say about it. The cards are very thin and slippery and my deck came without a ""Queen of Cups"" and with two ""Three of Swords"". I can't seem to find anyone else who's had this problem but I can't imagine that mine is the only useless deck in existance. REALLY frustrated!"
4,Excellent Gift,Beautiful and meaningful imagery with lush colors. An excellent deck for beginners or returning to reading from a long absence.
3,Average,"I purchased this deck but somehow I could not relate to the images in it at all. In a word, the whole deck was too 'glossy' - the images looked as if they were produced in some graphics software and the mechanical gadgetry somehow took away the magic. It just did not speak to me.The people in the images are especially too real - not drawings, and I guess that is one thing that I like about the illustrated decks. This looks as if someone modelled for the deck and then the maker put it together in a software...However, a friend of mine who is also a reader, looked at the deck and quite liked it. So I gave it away to him."
2,A Very Pretty Deck - Good for Fairs or Parties,"This is one of the lovely card sets that is visually pleasing, but seems powerless to the touch, and empty at first glance. They do spread out to make a pretty picture, and would be well used at a demonstration, a party should you allow the Tarot to be an entertainment ( not advised ).The card stock is flimsy, shiny, hard to handle, and would not hold up well for the professional readers. NIce to have but not to use."
3,Get card sleeves for this deck,"I was super excited about this deck because I'm an art snob, if I don't like the art I wont give it a second look, so this deck seemed perfect. Looking at the illustration I found it easier to make intuitive readings over my other deck. So why only 3 stars?The book is only ok in guiding you in a reading should you get stuck. And after shuffling the deck 3 times the black borders are already starting to get ruined. I've decided to save it as much as possible for reading other people and am going back to my original deck for fun readings."
4,"the image is so beautiful, and the Tarot deck tell me what I wish to know.","This Tarot card deck beautifull image , even better then I am expecting. I am so happy with this card. And also so far the card tell me what I want to know. Make me more enjoy and want to know more about Tarot."
5,I like this deck,"The packaging is only for transport, you will need something to keep the cards in later.The deck has the traditional cards, and is done in a style I like a lot. I prefer realistic and clear art, and I have no use for surrealistic pictures, which look like drawn by a 10 year old (*rant off*). The art of this deck is very good, and I like the touch with the mechanical elements on many of them.If you collect cards, you should take a close look at them."
5,Love this one,"Helps you remember the little things that we often forget. Effective for both domestic and international travel. No replacement for common sense, but a nice guide to help the frequent traveler."
4,Helpful,My kids liked the checklist and it was easy for me too. I gave them the checklist and they packed their own bags.
2,REAL KUNG FU,THIS IS FUN TO WATCH. LIKE THE SCENE WHEN YUFANG(BRUCE LI) AND HIS MASTER(CHEN SING)FIGHT THE APES. THIS IS A MUST BUY.
4,Great for Healing,I just purchased(from a health foods store) and began to use this oil a few days ago due to a surgical would that I was concerned about leaving a huge scar. I haven't used it long enough to see a difference in the appearance of my scar which is still at this point a wound. However almost immediately the swelling and tenderness in my somewhat fresh wound ceased. I'm amazed with the quick healing properties of Nature's Gate vitamin e oil and am more than eager to see what other benefits are to come from this awesome product.
4,Roll-on bottle is just right!,"What I love is the roll on bottle - that is what really earned the four stars. The product itself seemed to be effective. I purchased it to try to reduce the appearance of the many scars I now have. My skin did seem softer, but the bottle was quickly confiscated to be used on dog wounds. She's a pit mix, so a lot ow concern about any possibility of her looking like people want to label the breed. The multi-time daily regimen does seem to have worked (but we were also a using Neosporin) as she is healing beautifully."
1,ZERO STARS!!!!!,"This camra doesnt even deserve one str,I give it zero stars.My computer whouldnt reconise the camera,I have XP also.This is suposed to be for kids and I wasted ALOT of time trying to get this to work.The software looks so fun for kids,IF you chould just get it to work! What a disapointment,and waste of time!Im taking it back tomorrow"
1,PIECE OF GARBAGE - ZERO STARS,"Terrible quality, hard to use - and I am not a child which is who the item is supposed to be used by. Don't waste your time and money on this.Your cell phone will take a better picture!"
1,Bad Drivers & No Support ! ! !,XP would not recognize camera as removable drive. Drivers SAKAR provides don't help. No customer service and no support!
1,"Not Mac compatible, either","There is nothing out there to make this thing work with a Mac, don't waste your time. The CD that comes with it is only for PC. Also, the batteries will only last through a few pictures. It turned out that it wasn't even a fun toy for a little while."
1,Breaks easy,The forth time I put the USB cable into the camera the USB plug broke off inside of it (not the plug that goes to the computer but the USB port on the camera) and it's rattling around in there.Picture quality was very poor.Don't buy this.
1,"Not Mac compatible, Terrible Customer Service","This camera is not compatible with a Mac. Which is not stated on the packaging - ANYWHERE! I called customer service when I could not download the software, the representative told me that their products are not mac compatible so I would need to get another computer. Yes, I laughed. And that the fact that it is only for use on PC's was written in the manual. Indeed it was. But of course, why was it not written on the outside so that someone would know before buying and using it? She was a bit slow, and when I asked to speak to a supervisor she put me on hold. She would not give me her name and, you guessed it - I was on hold until the battery died on my home cordless phone! So, a complete waste of time and money, deceptive at best. The unnamed customer service rep did tell me that none of their products are mac compatible. So, no products from CyberGear, from Sakar International for Mac users. I believe they make crayola products as well, so be aware."
1,Not worthy of buying,I bought this camera thinking it would be a good Christmas gift. I am glad I tried it out before hand. What a waste of money.
1,Cheap and a waste of money,"My daughter got this as a gift for Christmas, she was terribly excited to get her own digital camera. While I tried to figure out how to get the camera to work (no clear on/off button, no flash, no screen), I realized just how ""cheap"" this camera was. My daughter could only take outdoor pictures, and unlike most digital cameras, there was no screen to see the picture she had just taken. I then tried to download her pictures to the software I had just put on our computer, but had no luck. The instruction manual made it seem ""simple"", but my computer wouldn't even recognize the camera hooked up. I now have to explain to my daughter that the pictures that she took will probably never be seen, and that we will now have to save up for a better digital camera. Don't waste your money or time on this camera. It is far from kid friendly!"
1,Complete Junk,"We got this as a birthday gift a while ago but the camera didn't work right out of the box. The text on the little LCD screen just faded in an out and the buttons didn't do anything. It feels cheap, it looks cheap and it doesn't work.The people who 'designed' and 'manufacturered' this POS together should be ashamed of theirselves. You're far better off getting your kid a real camera, even at 3x-4x the money."
1,Defective,"We ordered this based on the reviews and the brand name. When we received it we were initially impressed with the quality until we began assembling it. It appeared that they did not machine one half of the shelf correctly, and missed the bend by a fraction of an inch, because the two halves would not fit together no matter what. We ended up having to use a hydraulic press with 20 tons of pressure to force the two pieces together in the middle of the night so we could finish the job by morning. Overall very disappointed."
1,Creationism vs Old earth belief,"Dr. Baugh is using the same criteria to argue his case for a young earth as someone who believes in an old earth. He continually groups those who hold an old earth belief as being evolutionists. As was pointed out by the first review. This is what James Ussher did when predicting a 4004BC date which scientists laugh at today. I witnessed a debate between Dr. Hugh Ross(old earth) and Ken Hamm(young earth) and the evidence is clearly there for an old earth. God is supernatural but the case for a young earth cannot be argued by the physical laws, they clearly teach that the earth has been around for longer than 10,000 years. Why would God lead us to believe though science that we have an old earth? Science agrees with biblical revelation. Surely those that hold an old earth view can be do not have to believe in macroevolution."
1,Beware Pseudoscience!,This book makes no serious attempt to provide factual proof for any claim made within it. To find out the whole truth about this subject go to http://members.aol.com/Paluxy2/paluxy.htm
4,Good,"If you like the CrossGen comics, youll like these DVDs. It shows the pictures from the comic books with voice overs and it has some extras. I took one star off because, I would like to seem them make it into an actual cartoon with moving pictures and all, but its still good."
2,A waste of time!,"This movie sucks. I feel like I was watching Dukes of Hazard gangsters. When people get shot, it looks like barbque sauce on their shirt. I can't believe I wathced the whole thing. I think I lost IQ points."
4,Camel - Alive Record,Umd disco em verso remasterizada e com bnus desta banda que sabe fazer o som ao vivo. Boa gravao e embalagem também. Vale à pena para quem gosta de rock progressivo.
4,The classic Camel days,"When I was young, I saw Camel live and bought several of their record albums. Years later I was able to find some of their stuff on CD, but missed their live sound. The disk Pressure Points came toward the end, after a change in personel and sound. I was thrilled when I discovered this import double disk. It contains the entire Snow Goose album (with orchestra backing), plus all those songs I had seen them play. The recording is of very good quality and the collection of material is first rate. So why not 5 stars? The price for an import is a bit steep. Try Snow Goose or Moonmadness or Mirage to see if you are ""into"" jam rock at its 70s best. If you find you like their sound, you won't be sorry buying this live set."
5,Better than the original vinyl in every way,My original vinyl import still sounds great. But this CD reissue is incredible. More songs. Terrific sound quality. I'm sure to be annoying the kids just like I did my folks with this album turned up so loud it hurts...
5,It is awesom and I want one.,The reason i want a Tippman A-5 Stealth Is Cause I have A tippman 98 custom and tippman guns are the best.
3,Not up to her standards,"Dr. Warnick's book is not quite up to the standard I expected from other examples of her scholarship. It overreaches in many places, and the perspective is extremely dated. She is a fine rhetorician; however, this book is definitely not up to her standards."
3,Garmin c530,"The c530 will get you from point A to point B. However, in testimg it locally (Queens and Manhattan NY) I found its routing to be very different from what I would use(either ""fastest"" ot ""shortest"") In one case it actually would have sent me in the opposite direction resulting in 2 bridge tolls instead of one.I simulated a trip to New Jersey and the two routes it presented would have taken me through Manhattan(wasting 45 min to an hour) while Mapquest had a more sensible route.I guess if you are in completely unfamiliar territory it will, one way or another, bring you to your destination within a couple of yards.If you are familiar with some of the routing, then just procede as you wish, and the Garmin will re-calculate, repeatedly, as necessary and get you to your destination"
5,Great,Garmin StreetPilot c530 Vehicle GPS NavigatorThis product should have a rating of 10 works great
2,Goes dead,The first unit I bought went dead after two days. Amazon handled the problem fast and replaced it with a new one. Unfortunately it went dead again after two weeks. It unfortunate because is a helpful tool. We are considering giving Garmin one more chance.
4,Garmin StreetPilot c530 GPS Vehicle Navigator,"I am very pleased with the unit overall. Upon receipt, I promptly took a 3 week road trip in the Pacific Northwest. The functionality of the unit is very good. It was quick to set up and easy to use. I had read some reviews prior to purchase which stated the unit did not always give accurate routes. I did not find that to be true. My wife and I put it to the test going to some fairly rural areas and it never failed. It does have glitches that are to be expected. I was looking for a store that was in a mall, I did not know that fact at the time, the unit couldn't place the store as the address does not match the exact physical location of the store. Ounce experienced, easy to eliminate future like type experiences. I would recommended this unit if it meets your functionality expectations."
4,money well spent,"I love this garmin street pilot c530. The directions are great and if you miss your turn it resets in seconds. I only found 1 flaw when I was in NY looking for a restaurant bbq it didn't come on on the search and I was only down the street from it, but other wise I've had no other flaws."
2,get 330,this does not speak the streat names and is useless. Get something which tells you streat names.
1,Buying Nightmare,"I am so sick of trying to buy a GPS system. I just wanted a GPS like the one in a rental car I had recently, instead I have to compare 30 different systems (and that's just Garmin's ""on the road"" Automotive category) across 50 different ""features"" not including price. I'm exhausted with the whole process so I settle on this model and now I find out it doesn't have ""street name"" voices. I'm always going to remember this experience as distinctly unenjoyable."
4,Works great with some caveats,"This was a refurbished unit which made for a nice cost savings. I had assumed that it would have the current maps installed, which was not the case. My area (Phoenix) has had a fair amount of growth in recent years and I've found numerous instances where businesses and addresses that were put in two years ago are not in the database. It's a little frustrating to be faced with having to buy an expensive update for what should be a new/current system.Operation wise the unit works fairly well. Going through a complex freeway/overpass the system will may give an accurate instruction for an exit to take but too late to actually take it. It's not readily easy to put in and label a current waypoint - one has to provide a street address which may not be readily available.All in all it's a decent system that would be improved by having a switchable ETA/miles to destination option, and an altitude readout."
4,Garmin Street Pilot c530,"Outstanding Accuracy! Car on screen is always exactly where you are located at the time. Ease of operation is superb. Battey life is good. However, I do not think it always chooses the shortest route. Routes presented are at times different from what I drive on a day-to-day basis. Perhaps there could also be a category for Scenic Routes. Overall, an excellent instrument."
4,Garmin C530,I like this better than the Magellan that my friend has but I wish there is a way to program it to take alternate routes and not to keep pointing you back to the highway that you wanted to avoid.
4,Excellent Choice,I recently traded in an Infiniti G35 that had a nav system for a new model without. I find that the c530 GPS Vehicle Navigator is far easier and more convenient to use. The only thing I've had trouble getting used to is its position on the windshield. I keep confusing it with my rear view mirror!
2,Not as good as the C340,"This is an ok navigtor but if you want something that will tell you turn by turn prompts the C340 is for you. I have had 4 different ones & the one that I like the best is the C340. I only had the C530 for a few days & it quit working. I sent it back & got the C330. That one didn't last the day. The first C340 didn't work either. I sent it back & was really tired of all of them. I got one more & haven't had a problem with it yet so, I hope it lasts. I'll keep you all updated."
2,This map suck,"I bought this one this week because I needed to drive unknown road yesterday and today. This GARMIN is very easy to use and it turned dark automatically when outside gets dark. But, map in it is toooooo old. I couldn't find the address that I needed to visit. So I missed appointments. I recommend you buy one that includes the newest map on it. If you want to update the map, you need to pay about $60. If you were willing to pay additional 60, this GPS may be very useful."
1,Garmin Street Pilot c530,"This totally sucks! I have had so many bad experiences with this product! It's not accurate, it doesn't recognize a lot of streets or areas! It's doesn't do as is says it does! It is a total disappointment! I'm looking into a more reliable unit such as the Tom-Tom!"
2,Disappointing,"Have been using for a while and is easy enough to use. But does not always give best directions. Seems to divert from most efficient route. Even though quickest route is selected in options, directs me off highway onto stoplight dotted route which maybe shorter, but whole lot slower. Will get you there, but has questionable decision making in choosing route. Have tried contacting Garmin tech support, but they offered little or no help."
5,street pilot,"very nice addition to my wifes car, she gets lost in her closet.now she doesn't have to ask how to get there,enter an address and it talks you there and if you make a wrong turn it gives an alternate route."
3,travel helper,I haven't had to the opportunity to utilize the Garmin C530 much but playing with it seems easy enough to use. I have been using it around town and it seems to want to keep putting me on the highway instead of surface streets. Also had to buy updates seperately for maps. If I were to purchase another GPS unit I would go with the Navigon 5100 because it appears to have more features for the same amount of money'
3,crashed c530,I just bought this the middle of Dec. I really liked this product but after less than 2 weeks of use it crashed (wont power up) e-mailed amazon on their warranty hopefully it will be replaced will update when amazon responds. Overall the product is easy to use and accurate
4,Garmin Review,I purchased this product as a gift for a friend. I was instantly impressed with the easy of operation and fast link to satellites. As a resuly I purchase a similiar one for myself.
2,Not Impressed,"I borrowed one of these from a friend for a trip to Myrtle Beach, and thankfully, I printed out directions as well because this thing tried to take us way off course on the way there, and lost us for a good 100 miles around the Charlotte turnpike in NC. The only saving grace about having it was knowing (or hoping?) that if we did get terribly lost, we could eventually get back on track with this thing. On the way home, we missed a turn via the printed directions due to confusion over the difference between what the gps said and what the printed directions said. So we went with the gps and it took us a good hour out of our way.Unfortunately I had the same problems with a rented version on another trip down there that I was ""assured"" was updated. If it was, then Garmin needs some updating themselves. I wouldn't recommend this for purchase, and when I start shopping for a gps soon, I won't be looking at Garmin products period."
4,Garmin c530,"Wow! I cant say enough good about this little GPS powerhouse.It is a quality unit that is packed with features and is easy to use.The touchscreen interface is logically thought out,not confusing to navigate the menu options. It is also easy to read.The mapping software is full featured and seems to be accurate.Software updates from Garmin are also a snap to install.Lastly, the price it sells for (new) at Amazon is the lowest all around.(please note the low price is due to the C530 modelbeing discontinued this year. It's successor, the c550has a few more features like Bluetooth and mp3 player,but at almost three times the price.)Regarding any Garmin StreetPilot product, you cant go wrong. Buy it!"
4,Saved my temper in Canada!,The Garmin c530 Street Pilot is agreat GPS without any bells and whistles. If you are looking a good value that will get you from point A to B I would highly recommend. We used on trip through Canada and New England and found it fanastic.(Maine and Canada don't belive in road signs) For traveling in a new area this is the only way to go!
2,A women giving directions you can trust,The 530C has been great. A little like map quest in giving directions that need a double check but still very handy. Its best asset is finding the closest resturant-hardware store-hospital to your present location.
5,Great unit,"This is a great unit for the money, I never had any problems with it yet, out of the box and ready to go, I bought a extra SD card for it and I am loading customs POI from the net."
4,Garmin c530 GPS navigator - long term update,"Works fine so long as you know the exact street address you are going to. Otherwise you need to guess the street number / street name. Not great for planning trips.Updated 16 Mar 2010But it works like a charm for finding a friend's house when you know the address, or if you have bookmarked the location. It worked very well for an 850 mile trip to my son's house, and stuck pretty closely to the trip maps that AAA provided.I like the way you can pick your own route, or deviate from the recommended route, and switch back to machine-determined directions later.Map updates every year go for about $70, which I feel is a little stiff. But I'll go for that if I'm making a long or complicated trip.I'm a confirmed believer in GPS-driven navigation!"
1,The C530 GPS is a junk!,"The C530 GPS that I purchased from PCNation less than two weeks ago stoped working. What happened was:1, The touch screen stoped reacting to any input attempts;2, I turned off the unit;3, The unit cannot be turned back on any more either on its own battery or on external power. It is dead!I am waiting for response from the retailer and will follow up with their solution."
4,Car Navagation Systems,"I like the ease of operating this unit and the enhanced capacity to hold the signal. One still experiences a loss of signal in tunnels and densely populated areas w/ tall buildings. The unit will display the entire route so you can see which way you are going but does not allow you to choose a route to go highway versus local roads. Be patient when turning on unit, it can take from 2-4 min for unit to find signal."
4,GPS gift,"The unit only worked for about 3 days and would no longer boot up. I had to return it to GARMIN. Garmin quickly replaced with new unit and it has been working great. I suspect the unit had a defective electronic component.My hat goes off to Garmin for the no hassle, no question fast replacement."
3,c530?,"The first one I got lasted three weeks then stopped working. Amazon replaced it, the second one stopped working yesterday (lasted 9 months). Garmin says they have an average turn-around of two weeks for repairs (we'll see).Although I set it for the quickest route, it will opt for the shortest.Although I set it to avoid toll roads, I end up on toll roads.Although I set it to avoid u-turns, she wants me to make u-turns.One time was looking for a restaurant in upstate NY, we picked one name (out of many listed) which sounded interesting and ended up at a horse farm.I rated it 3 out of 5 because; 1)Price was good. 2)It lists the next cross street in map mode which is nice to have at night. 3)It's better than not having it.I'm now stuck with this model. If I could do it again, I'd try a different modelGood Luck"
3,Lacking some basic features,"The unit is easy to operate and has some cute vehicle icons, but it does not display the GPS coordinates. One of the basic features should be to allow you to view your GPS coordinates. The Garmin rep I spoke to said that this feature is available on the Nuvi unit, but it costs an additional $200. I sent it back and bought the Magellan Crossover. It does everything the c530 did and more. It doesn't have the changeable icons, but it does tell me where I am and I can enter GPS coordinates and it will direct me there."
4,Work's Great,"This unit is great, even better than I expected. If there is a downside it is that it doesn't recognize ""shortcuts"" to favorite places.My wife will never get lost again! She may not be shown the shortest way home but she will get home."
3,Great when it works.,"So far my experience has been somewhat frustrated. Once the navigator system is on it works great and is extremely helpful. However, I have had on-going issues with it coming on. Sometimes it takes 10-15 minutes for it to come on, other times it blinks, ""Street Pilot"" over and over and will not let you program it. After speaking with a rep on the phone I believe it will be corrected, but that doesn't change the frustration I am feeling with it."
3,Very good product but not excellent,"This GPS is not bad at all for the money I paid, $179. But to is a little complicated to enter the addresses. I have seeen better GPS but of course you pay a lot more. In conclusion, for $179 not bad at all."
2,GPS,This model does not state the street's name as the older model. Bit confusing when city streets are so close together.
3,"Important ""gotcha"" with this unit","One Buyer Beware on this unit is that it will ship with Version 8 of the mapping software. NOT the latest version 2008. This is per Garmin. This model must be being discontinued. Version 8 is a significant step down in that the routing algorythm it uses is pretty poor. Even worse than 7. Unless you plan on paying for the upgrade as well, skip this unit"
5,awesome product...,I bought this product after reading a lot of reveiws. This is my first experience with auto GPS device and let me tell you its darn easy to use. The POI collection is excellent. Great product....
3,Good - BUT,"This is a good GPS, with clear, bright screen, high satellite sensitivity, fast response and good navigating. But, while navigating to a destination geographical feature names, such as rivers, oceans, etc. are not displayed, nor are any other points of interest (POI's). To display a park, for example, one must go to another screen and select the POI from a list for it to be displayed. This has to be repeated for every POI. The same is true for restaurants, lodging and so on. There are other GPS brands which are also of excellent quality but allow the user to select display preferences which can show any or all POI's while navigating, such as Magellan. These are more user-friendly."
4,Great GPS for the money,First: I want to thank Amazon for their good price and fast delivery!Second: I want to compliment Garmin for standing behind their product and very good tech service.Review: The first c530 unit was defective (wouldn't acuire satellite) Called customer service (got right through & actually talked to a person!)Customer rep talked me through resetting the unit to no avail. Sent unit back to Garmin (UPS) and within 5 days had a new working unit up and going. This unit is easy to use right out of the box. I'm not computer friendly! but found this very user friendly. I've only had this unit 1 wk. but have found it very helpful in finding addresses. I am looking forward to useing this unit when we go on vacation to Branson in about a week so I will know better how the c530 works on the long haul!I don't believe that you can find a better entry level GPS unit for the money.
4,totally worth the money,"we got this gps after a little bit of searching for one that doesn't have a bunch of bells and whistles.. but it good for just going around town and getting where you want to go. the street pilot has been awesome. we just moved to a new city and it has been so helpful and accurate, that we've already begun to take it for granted! if you're looking for a gps system that is reliable and a good deal.. buy a streetpilot.. you won't be disappointed."
2,No Route Capability,"Just got a return note from Garmin Support. Although advertised as having Routes and waypoints, it just isn't so. Using MapSource on your computer (which you must request) leaves something to be desired. After all the hassle of learning MapSource(not worth getting into here), I uploaded the Routes and Waypoints. In the favorites, just the waypoints appear. Figured I was doing something wrong. Contacted Garmin. They confirmed. The Nuvi 660 (and the C530) does not support routes. So, if you wish to plan trips before going on them, forget Garmin. I'm looking elsewhere, and looking to return my (daughters presents) units.Too be fair, the C530 unit seems excellent for just getting from here to there. The Nuvi 660 is not worth the extra $300. The MP3 player only works over an FM transmitter (poor), and only handles MP3. No M4A (I could understand the M4P problem, but not the M4A)."
4,Great so far,I have minimal experience with any kind of GPS but needed one to help with a trip from PA to TX. I didnt want to spend a lot of money so I did a lot of research and found the Street Pilot C530. It was very good for what I needed and I do recommend it.
4,GARMIN SCENIC ROUTE,"GARMIN TOOK US ON A SCENIC ROUTE THROUGH WASHINGTON DC TO AVOID AN ACCIDENT. WE'RE NOT SURE IF THE ROUTE WAS SHORTER, BUT SAW VARIOUS MONUMENTS. WISH IT COULD TELL U THE REASON FOR RECALCULATION SO U COULD DECIDE FOR YOURSELF IF DETOUR IS WORTH THE CHANGE. THE TRAFFIC WAS HORRENDOUS ON NEW ROUTE AND SEEMED TO PROLONG TRIP. ALSO WE MIGHT HAVE DECIDED TO WAIT OUT THE ACCIDENT."
4,Good GPS for the money,"This GPS works very well. You could buy another lower brand for the same money but Garmin is so well known that I decided to buy this one at this price. I am glad I did.It sometimes seems to take you ""through the city"" to get somewhere when there is a better way. The bottom line is that it may not always take you the quickest way but it gets you from point A to point B. The time of arrival is very accurate. You can either start driving off route to recalculate if you don't like the route it gives you or you can push the detour button. There are lots of points of interests, all by category. The touch screen is very nice and easy. The screen can be adjusted for day and night driving as well as 3D or 2D. I would recommend this to others for a decent priced GPS."
5,Garmin StreetPilot c530,"This is one fine product, I have been using this product for one year and love it. I have compared the c530 to many my friend have to include the Tom Tom and Magellan, and the Garmin c530 wins hands down. My only gripe is the updates cost too much at $68.00, I feel this is a little high."
1,Worst. Movie. Ever.,"No Lemmy. We watched it for 30 minutes, and that was 35 minutes too long.Don't waste your time! Don't make our mistake!Too much violence against women. Ron Atkins HATES women."
1,A chronicle of the decay of a once thriving film market.,"It's difficult to believe that this film was filmed in the same place where Luis Bunuel, Arturo de Cordova, German Valdez, Pedro Infante, and the Soler brothers. It's a low class, vulgar, degenerate, and non-inventive waste of time.The sad thing is that this is the type of film that dominated the mexican movie industry in that period."
1,Not recommended,"I bought this book, along with a number of others, to find out the nutritional values of different foods. Unfortunately, it is nearly impossible to find a specific food item in this particular book, if it is even included at all. There are better alternatives on the market, and I'd recommend choosing one of those. (For example, ""The Doctor's Pocket Calorie Fat & Carbohydrate Counter,"" which is quite small but *loaded* with information.)"
4,Not as good as Harvey's Celebrity Fit Club Workout,"I have been working out to the Celebrity Fit Club Boot Camp Workout for 2 years now and love it - but I was looking for a little variety. I love Harvey, but this workout is not as challenging or fun! There is little humor or bantering with the people in the workout. It's good for a change but I would recommend the Celebrity workout for a better workout that is more fun."
4,Highly Recommend this DVD,"I was a little skeptical before I made this purchase. However, I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase. Harvey Walden REALLY gives a good workout on this DVD. I like that he starts you off at the beginners level then you progress to the advanced level. You are sweating and your muscles will get a MAJOR workout!! It's not your typical exercise DVD, but change is good!! I highly recommend this DVD and will purchase more DVD's from Harvey Walden."
4,For Harvey Walden / CFC fans only!,"It's an old program, the music is cheezy, and he's very repetitive so you've gotta take this one with a grain of salt. Anyone who watches Fit Club and likes Walden's delivery is going to like this. I'd also recommend this for anyone with a short attention span that needs thier work-outs quick and fast paced. Only about a half-hour, but it definitly kicks your butt."
1,Not happy,I did not like this dvd. I did try it out several times and just was not happy with the low-scale surroundings and Harvey constantly barking out orders to everyone. I know that this is what he does in the Fat Club show but it was in no way entertaining to me. It didn't hold my attention..it was not enjoyable to use.I would not recommend this dvd to anyone.
3,It's okay,"No music! What were the producers thinking?!? I like Harvey's more laid back style f/TV & will give the other DVD a try. This one has 2 much of an ""army feel"" to it"
5,Research book 1,I had no issues receiving this book. It came quickly and in the condition the sender reported it would be in.
5,radical bathing,"An inspiring take on the elemental pleasures of bathing and the body. The power of environment, contrast of minimalist and over-the-top, to awaken the senses. Ancient to modern."
1,NEED A BETTER DESCRIPTION,"Nothing I read led me to believe these are replacement blades only, thought i was getting a good deal on a pack of broadheads but got something i can 't use.Wasp makes a great broadhead but i haven't been able to replace blades onlydue to the damage to the housing that holds the blades."
5,Nice item!,We needed this to carry my 2 yr olds crayons on outings! This is very cute and well made and comes in so handy! Great price too. Thanks!!!
2,Huh?,"I'm a huge Charlie Watts fan, and was delighted to see a ""biography"" about him finally published. But this book is more about the UK jazz and ""beat"" scene of the early 1960s, and uses Charlie quotes from numerous sources (admitting that he would not respond to requests by the author for a new interview) that I've read a million times before. Nothing new, and the prose employed by author Clayson quickly tires, leaving the reader exasperated, wondering if the true facts about Charlie and his private life could fill a three page pamphlet. If the subject is truly a private individual, a revealing portrait is tough. Charlie is a truly private individual, and this is a tough read!"
4,Execede OEM,"There is a good product, NGK don't make universal products They build specific item for only best cars in the wordl"
4,Families are where you find them.,"I liked the characters in this story precisely because they were different. Much is said about diversity these days but in reality we have very little tolerance for people who are different than the TV images that create us. But sometimes necessity forces us into unlikely alliances and once we get close enough to know one another...really, we can begin to care. Hopefully this story will encourage readers to look more kindly on those living at the edges of our society and take the risk of knowing them."
4,Not about writing hit songs. More about how to persist and make contacts.,"This book is not about writing hit songs but more about how to persist and make contacts. If that's an art form then this is a useful book but I have read many pep-talk books in other topics in the past.This book will not tell you how to write a hit song, if such a thing can actually be taught, which I very much doubt. What this book will tell you is that you need communication skills and constant persistence to succeed. And even then you still need a lot of luck. However, there may very not be a science to writing hit songs other than that one must be willing to do anything, write anything and go anywhere. Most unsuccessful songwriters either can't or won't. 4-stars because I read it cover to cover so it certainly isn't boring."
5,A fundamental necessity for any aspiring songwriter,"Songwriting consultant and recipient of two gold records, one platinum record, and one double-platinum records, and composer/writer for 38 television themes and movie scores, Molly-Ann Leikin draws upon her considerable experience and expertise to show aspiring song writers how to not only create hit lyrics and compose successful melodies, but such essential songwriter tasks as crafting song structure, collaborating, securing a publisher, recording the song, and marketing music on the Internet. How To Write A Hit Song is a fundamental necessity for any aspiring songwriter, and an ideal introduction, instruction, and reference guide regardless of the category, genre or niche of their music."
4,Delightfully appealing to the eye and ear!,"Patricia Polacco caputres the desire of every child to be accepted for who she/he is regardless of their abilities. Once again, the child with a 'difference'who doesn't seem to fit into the society he/she lives in, is supported in a positive way."
4,applemando's dreams,I'm seven years old. I think this is a good book from ages 4 and up. My favorite things about this book are:1) Story because it is creative.2) Pictures because they're colorful.3) The message because dreams are important.

2,Appelemando's Dream,This is a book about a boy named Appelemando and he has a special power. When he dreams itcomes out of his head and into the air. This book is good. I like that the auther wrote about a problem with a hard subject. Also the book had a great ending. This book has very good art. So if you like to dream like Appelemando you should get this book. Jeffrey C.
2,Tracks n scraps,"I always appreciated the over-recorded guy in short length format better, even if there are a few good tunes at startup however, nothing makes the rest justify hunting."
2,Very Disappointed,"These sheets are not what I had hoped for. Although they look very nice in the package, they do not fit my 17 inch mattress properly. The front of the package clearly states, ""Deep pockets fit mattresses up to 18 inches."" The fitted sheet does not fit the corners or the sides of the mattress properly. Also, the fabric does not feel like a 600 Thread Count should feel. Perhaps it would soften after many washings. I have 400 TC sheets comparably priced that are much softer and fit better. I do not recommend this product."
2,Dissatisfied,"If you like really nice soft bed sheets, these are not for you! They look really nice but even after several washes they're absolutely normal sheets. The 600 Thread count means nothing in this situation. In fact, it feels tougher than cheap sheets I've bought at Ross before. I guess they're inexpensive (kind of at $49.99) for a reason. But I wouldn't buy these again nor would I recommend it if you're looking for comfortable sheets."
4,We really enjoy them,"These were so pretty. I loved the striping and they were so soft. I've learned these types of sheets you have to give several washes to though to really get the complete softneses. My only wish is that they were a bit deeper pocketed.........yes they are one of the deepest out there, but I can't seem to find any sheet that is deep enough for our bed. We have a pillowtop with a memory foam on top.... so that makes it tough. All in all for the price I totally say give these a try."
5,AN AMAZING MOVE,This is one of those movies i watch over and over again secretly hoping i hadn't seen it before just so i could feel the surprises like i did the first time i watched it. It's a fabulous movie.One of the most amazing parts of the movie is the acting. Some people may think it was poorly done but the fact that the two seem awkward and silent at times just makes it more real. it's not like those hollywood stories that you bore you with cheesy dialogs that makes you feel like an idiot because they have to explain every little thing to you. It's an amazing movie. WATCH IT!
3,Fairly good,"I enjoyed this movie, but wanted it to be better. The young star of the movie is very good and totally adorable. The storyline is one I can relate to, as can many of us. Overall, I am glad I bought and watched it, and will probably watch it again."
3,Nice message.,"Derivative. It's been done before. Nicely paced, photographed, acted, however. Performances believable. Minimally schmaltzy. A solid effort with a positive message. Sadly, those who most need to see and understand the film would never watch it in a million years so it's rather another ""preaching to the choir"" situation here. I wish it were otherwise."
1,Worse than a gay Harlequin romance,"The setting is beautiful, the two main leads are pretty, but the pacing of this movie is so incredibly slow and the plot is so incredibly predictable (with one exception) as to make it unwatchable. The one exception to the predictability of the plot is that there's no typical romance happy ending, which makes this movie even more unsatisfying. I'm really surprised this movie was made in 2007 as you'd think there wouldn't be any 18 year old gay boys in California who didn't realize that they could be Christian and gay. I really have to disagree with another reviewer of this movie who said that it was better than Latter Days! Latter Days was a bit predictable too, but at least it had a happy ending and realistic character interactions."
4,I chose some new bedtime reading,"This was a very romantic movie, but I felt let down at the end. The main characters were adorable and the story line was incredible, made you want more. I wish they would do a sequel so we can see where both characters have ended up!"
2,Important storyline - unbearably bad acting,The acting is unimaginably bad and the brief frontal nudity is gratuitous and could be awkward for some audience members. I almost stopped watching after 10 minutes. I'm glad I watched the whole movie because the theme is important. A theme I've not previously seen explored. I only wish the acting had been better.
2,Preachy and leaves much to be admired,"This film attempts to explore being gay and Christian--coming out, acceptance, and righteousness. As presented, it comes across a tad preachy. The acting leaves a lot to be admired (or perhaps the storyline was too contrived to bring to life). Either way, I found it fairly unentertaining. If you find this topic interesting, however, you might have the patience to sit through it, which moves at snail speed."
2,AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE REALLY THAT STUPED?,"I did not like this film main reason is because did not felt any "" TRUTH"" in it , is that idiotic country people really give that much importance to religion? UAU and waht is that "" CAMP"" that he talks about in the end of the movie ? i place to TEACH gay people to be heterossexual? in civilized countries like mine this tipe of facility is AGAINTS the low because of PREJUDICE against sexual orientation. Every time o see a movie and see thinks like "" gay correction camps"" os separete school for grils who are pregnant, i THANK GOD on my knees i was not bourn in that pityfull country"
2,"slow action - slower action - ""Rock Haven""","To watch it you need 78 minutes. These will be 78 looooooong minutes. The action drags unbelievably. Dialog here, a few lines there and a landscape and another landscape, some flowers, plants...ooops, another dialog.It feels as if the director was more focused on the nature than on actors, their play etc.The plot isn't best either. There is only one looser here and it is a gay person (the one living out of the closet).The ending is less than imaginative. The viewers are left with nothing.I give the second star for acting, which is not bad.Don't waste your money, rent it."
2,"Ok, But not the best","The movie is okay but not the best. First, if you want to see a movie with the same plot, but better, see Latter Days. It is an interesting movie but is a bit slow. I did not like the ending. Latter Days had the perfect ending and ended happily, but this ending was a little unclear. It didn't have happy ending though. I would watch it once... but wouldn't make a habit of it, unless you won't to see the infamous love scene."
1,Terrible,"This film is awful. Bad acting, bad script, bad directing. Don't buy. Buy Shelter instead (awesome film!)"
3,3-D climax IS on the DVD...as a hidden Easter Egg.,"The anaglyphic 3-D (red/green glasses work best) climax IS included on the DVD, but for some reason, it's hidden as an Easter Egg. However, it is easily found in the special features menu; it won't take you more than a few seconds to find it! Strange they didn't advertise this on the disc cover, as it certainly wouldn't have hurt sales."
2,"Contrived, and not moving","Part of me hates to give a negative review. Any author is a real person who has put forth effort in a way I have to respect. However, I was quite disappointed in this book. I felt it was very contrived and found myself repeatedly rereading sections because I found it so difficult to believe characters would act in the manners described. The antagonist was way too simplistic and therefore the plot was quite predictable. Also, I found myself unmoved by the romance or the characters' plights in general.Two parts I did like were the character, the Honorable Olive - sometimes there are those children who just light up a room, and the dance scene, which succeeded in being simultaneously uplifting and melancholy. I liked how everyone in the room sensed its importance and therefore conspired to let them have as long as possible."
2,Very little character development and world building,"Beautiful writing. I would've wished for a bit more character development as the reader doesn't really get a glimpse into the character's head, motivating factors and what really makes her keep her profession secret from her brother. Other than that, the description is beautifully done. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the likes of I Capture the Castle."
2,Verrryyy Disappointing,There were no chemistry between the main characters Anna and Rupert. The writiing style needs a little bit work such as the setting. It was kinda difficult to follow. The only positive thing to say about this book was that there was a sense of humor.Over all i would not recommend anyone to read this.
3,i was disappointed,"i was really excited to read this book; i love historical romances, especially after 'to catch a pirate' and so i was curious to see how this would turn out. from the summary, it sounded like a good love story. but i was disappointed to find it barely concentrated on them at all. there were only like five scenes at the most with them together at all. so you would think that if not a love story, the story is at least about anna's experiences after leaving russia. but that was messed up to. the author didn't focus on anna nearly as much as she should have. the author wrote some unnecessary detailed scenes of other characters that weren't important. by the second half of the book, i understood when to just skip scenes that were only distracting the reader from the focus of the book."
3,Not the best book ever written,"This book was okay. The plot was nothing new, the writing was tolerable. I will not read this author again."
4,Both Over- and Under-Told,"The writing style was very rich, which added a lot to the setting and characters. I felt like the book was a little long - some of the character viewpoints could have been cut, but it was still nice to get a complete picture.Of course, you love the two main characters. Individually, they are each generous and kindhearted. You hear their stories and see how they interact with others and know that they'd be suited to each other. So while it's nice to see them fall in love, it's also a little strange because they spend hardly any time together. The scenes in which they are together are very few. They're good people, and then suddenly they are in love."
2,Just okay,The book was mildly entertaining but I felt that the writing was more suited to a younger audience. I don't plan to read any more books by this author.
3,Countess Below Stair,"The book was a fun read, I have to admit, once the reader passes the first three or so chapters. The main character, Anna, makes me want to gag. She is what one might call ""a Mary Sue."" She is the very cliché, flawless, beautiful, intelligent, rich girl whom her father covered in gifts, but apparently she wasn't spoiled because she was naturally sweet, and she is graceful, everyone loves her, she loves music, she rides horses, and the list never ends. Gross! How about some creativity? Other than that, it's not a bad read."
2,Greatly Dissapointed,"I was greatly dissapointed by this book because of the lack of fullness in characters. They seemed like hollow shells of perfection, each having a beautiful face, but with nothing going on inside them. I found that each character didn't seem to have any flaws in there character and I also found that a girl raised to be a countess would not want to or be able to keep up with the constant hard labor of servants to an estate. Many of the characters had a disability of some sort, such as an invalid relative to take care of, or a crippled leg, but these didn't seem to have any effect on how they lived and it didn't seem to effect their minds at all. Although this is listed as a ""romance"" type novel, there was no chemistry between the main characters Anna Grazinsky and Rupert, and I didn't believe anything that happened in the last 1/5 of the book. Over all, this book is not one that I would recommend for readers."
3,A great idea just not executed well.,"I read the description for this book and I was immediately intrigued. The book pulled me in at the beginning but then the book started covering all these different character's lives and I thought that they were unnecessary and made the book drag a little. However, the characters are extremely true to life and really stick in your mind. Eva Ibbotson writes beautifully and if you're looking for a well written book this is the one."
1,This is not a Stan Brakhage movie,"This is not a Stan Brakhage movie (the 3 minute ""Dark Night of the Soul"" by Stan Brakhage has not been released in a DVD for public purchase) but a horror movie made in late 1990's."
4,The film college drug parties are made of!,"This is one of the most bizarre flicks I have seen, so weird off the all and eerie it stands out more than a lot of indie films I've seen. A skeleton faced ghoul uses black opium to brainwash people into his occult philosophy.Stars John Brodie who I remember as the reptile guy from the documentary ""Horror Business"" and directed by the wacky Ron Atkins also in that documentary. The film is used at college drug parties at PSU as one of the initiations into new frats, to freak out the pledge. It's wacky, weird and a serious head trip. If you like films that are really different you may dig it!"
3,"ok tape,","i realy didnt like the quality of the recording. looks like the tape has been taped over 20 times,and a lot of noise on the screen and i had to manually track the image.other than that an ok tape."
4,Awesome,"An awesome RPG. I love this series. For all you RPG fans, definitely check it out. Also check out the other games in the series, all of them are different in one way or another."
3,could be better,Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI is not as good as Romance of the Three Kingdoms X. It's a little disappointing. Seems to be a bit rushed in it's production. Hope XII is as good as X.
4,Have fun at nineteen knots in Hamburg Harbor,Easy to use even on a laptop with keyboard controls. Pleasant experience with many ship selections and manoevering options available. Realistic shoreside simulations. Many advanced options. An enjoyable game for those who love the sea and always dreamt of being captain of their own ship. Watch for the icebergs!
4,Ship Sim,This game is fun for people who love to drive boats and everything about boating. If you ever wanted to be a captain and not go through the trouble of taking a test and buying a boat then this is your chance.
5,A Review of my favorite Ship Game.,"This Game is AWSOME!!!! I love Ships soooo I Found this Game and I LOVEEEEEE IT!!!!!!!!! If you Like Ships,,,,GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Very excellent service,I want to thank you for doing an very excellent service and being very propht in customer service
2,Ship Simulator,"Not quite what I had expected. I ordered the game after reading about it on the Auran website and other places, thinking it would be more like TRS 2006, Railroad Tycoon or some other game in which you picked up cargo, passengers, etc., and delivered these/them to some destination elsewhere. I was surprised when I found that about all you really do is manuver your ship from one point to the other. To me the game was no fun at all and a big flop. Unlike Trainz and other games or sims, there isn't that much scenery, just the outskirts of cities as seen from dockside and baywise. This game might get raves from some and, in a few years might be a lot better but for now it definately isnot for me."
5,Good product!,"I've been using this product for years and years, and no longer could find it in the department stores. Thank goodness I found it on Amazon! To the company: Dillard's no longer offers this product in Memphis, TN, or Nashville, TN, where I shop frequently. Please continue to stock it so I can order from Amazon ..."
3,from Brazil,"Maria sings in several languages (including English), Mario leads the band on piano. Notes in Portuguese and samples athttp://mariajoao.oninet.pt/discos/tralha (dot) htmlThe songs with samples are in English and tend towards the ballad side, the ones sung in Portugese might be different (no samples)."
1,47 mansions and nothing on...,"300+ pages, 47 mansions - and not one single floor plan! Disappointed beyond words; and the photos weren't that good either. Don't bother with this one!"
1,ONLY the Flipper NOT the entire rest (bolt...etc),"The flipper works fine, however, the picture is deceiving. The picture shows the entire arrow rest, including the bolt that goes through the bow's arrow rest mount. YOUR ARE ONLY BUYING THE LITTLE FLIPPER AT THE END OF THE REST. Somebody messed up on the product description."
2,Biased!,I started to read this book with hardly any opinion about the two main characters. I soon started to realize the author's bias towards Sara and against Eleanore! She uses subjective snide remarks about Eleanore to promote Sara. In her book Sara can do nothing wrong while everything Eleanore does is questionable and fraught with ulterior motives.
4,It's all Mother's Doing,"Very informative, certainly showed another view of Eleanor. While Eleanor may be changed her view of Sara in her (Eleanor's) later years, it apepared to me that the Eleanor we love would not have existed without Sara's influence. I was surprised that Sara has been so much forgotten by history, not that Presidential mothers are often remembered. It lent great insight to Eleanor and FDR also. Certainly Sara was a 'lady' in the very old sense and also a woman who could and did change with the times. I found it enjoyable and would recommend it to anyone with an eye for history, politics and the Roosevelts and well as women of influence."
2,Komfort Kidz Shoes,I bought these shoes because the my daughter (9 mos) was in between sizes of the shoes she normally wears (pedipeds). When I recieved them I was disapointed that they were not white like in the picture but more of a cream color. They were also very wide and did not fit her feet as well. I noticed the stitching around the shoe was already coming apart and we had not even worn them yet. I would not reccomend these shoes. The are cute and a good price but they are made cheaply.
2,LA MOM,"Loved, loved, loved these shoes until they fell apart after 3 weeks! Leather is nice and supple, design is adorable, price is fantastic, but.... The whole stitching around the front of the shoe is too weak for a 14 month old walking!"
2,It's not white!!,Yes the shoes are adorable... but it's hard for me to put them on my daughter because the pair I received was off-white / cream... do they don't really match with her black and WHITE dress or her red and WHITE dress. I keep forgetting to get something cream to match them!! Now I'm looking at other pairs of shoes to buy and I'm wary about whether I'll get white or not-white!!
3,These shoes are maybe good for babies,"I bought it for my 2 years old daughter and was disappointed. the shoes are very wide and do not provide support, the leather is very soft, but thet are not the best fit for running around. they just look bulky and if i didn't have to use them in a certain eventi would have definately returned them. There are better looking/better quality/support shoes out there."
3,Grizzly G2532 1 HP Single phase 1750 RPM,I ordered my first one and overloaded it and burned it up. Called the company to see if they would warranty it. Never received an answer. That was disappointing although I bought another and have had success with the second one now for about 6 months.
4,Not Bad,"Heres one i took a chance on, having never viewed it. Nice atmosphere helps a pretty good Werewolf story. In fact this is a story of a werewolfs origin due to a curse put on an ancestor of the man. Sexy women abound as witches, and the Werewolfs love interests."
3,GOOD OLD SPANISH CHEESE !,"""CURSE OF THE DEVIL"" is a lusty old time spanish werewolf classic! Any real true horror movie fan can appreciate these kind of timeless but out-dated cheesey gems. Perfect for a cold rainy day!"
4,nice little picture,First of all I would like to [say] that this film is dubbed and that's why it seemed like the characters lips weren't moving at times. Obviously he hasn't been exposed to the european stage because dubious dubbing isubiquitous throughout this genre here in North America. Good luck in tracking down the subtitled version. Anyway this film was great. Nice to see a brilliant sumptuous transfer in tact here. Actually the dubbing wasn't as bad in this one either. Make sure to watch Werewolf Shadow as a precursor to this.
1,CURSE OF THE DEVIL,THIS WAS THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IT SEEN LIKE THE PICTURE WAS OUT OF TIMEING PEOPLE WAS TALKING AN THEIR LIPS WAS NOT MOVING I ONLY WISH I HAD MY MONEY BACK
2,This is such a dumb movie!,"I've been involved in cub scouting for years as a mom and leader and have seen a fair share of pinewood derbies. I know this movie is supposed to be a farce but it is so over the top as to make it stupid. No dads are this selfish. It's clean for the most part (still, there are some mom's with plenty of cleavage showing) but it's just too stupid for words. If you really want to buy it don't waste a lot of money on it, buy it used or from a discount outlet."
5,Greatly exceeded expectations,"I was only expecting a mediocre movie, but I was very pleasantly surprised. It had a good mix of humor, reality and hyperbole. Great, clean, movie for the whole family."
5,Great for the Boy Scout in your life!,This movie is such a cute family friendly movie! We have a Boy Scout in the family who has been in the Pinewood Derby races before. When you watch this movie if you've been a part of the Pinewood Derby you'll totally relate. Even if you don't have a Boy Scout in your life this is still a great family movie full of laughs!
5,Family entertainment.,"This is a great movie for kids and families, especially those that are familiar with the Pinewood Derby. Part of the humorous plot is how parents tend to get too involved in their kid's projects (and do more work on it than the kid!). We rented it, then bought it from Amazon. Two thumbs up."
4,A very good family movie,"It was much better than I thought it would be. It is about 3 dads who go overboard trying to develop the winning pinewood derby car. There aim is two fold, to win and especially to beat Ace Montana (""the best name in the world"")It isn't an academy award contender but it is a fun and harmless family movie that everyone can enjoy. I recommend it."
3,OK Read,"Wolfram Gerhart has been dispatched by royal command to bring Kathryn Somers to Henry V court. Kit refuses to go off with Sir Gerhart (she needs to stay where her returning betrothed can find her), but events conspire against her and she is forced to leave with the brooding knight. Expecting to head straight for London, Kit is surprised by Wolfram's insistence that they stop at Castle Windermere, a somber place shrouded in mystery and intrigue.All in all, an ok read. The plot was predictable, and at times the situations and dialogue were painfully naive and trite, but the story always moved at a brisk pace and the characters were well developed and likable."
4,It was great.,I thought The Bride of Windermere was great for a first-time writer. The characters were so vivid and lively. The setting was realitstic and accurate. I can't wait to read the sequel.
1,Don't waste your money,"CD player burnt out in three months and never worked well anyway. The features are very limited and difficult to use. The FM receiver only goes up to 106.9.Buy this only if you are seeking to fill the landfills, but I can think of cheaper ways to do that."
