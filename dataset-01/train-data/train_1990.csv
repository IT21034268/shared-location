5,Shades of the Past,"My father had this album, when I was a child, and it was one of my absolute favorites. Even though I haven't heard it since then, I still remember the music very well, and am so glad to see it again on CD. After all of these many years, I still break out in a rousing rendition of ""Goober Peas' occasionally. I highly recommend this CD, and hope it brings you as much enjoyment as it has brought me."
5,Excellent.....American folk at its best,"These fellas have made an excellent song choice - most well known and done with passion as fitting the times they were originally written and performed. EXCELLENT - Goober peas - What fun! Lay ten dollars down, my favorite!"
2,Not what I expected.,"Sorry, but I can't share the positive opinions of my fellow reviewers. It was quite a disappointing experience listening to this CD and I have to say that the singers can in no way compete with the beautiful and powerful singing voice of Ernie Ford nor with the Mormom Tabernacle Choir."
3,Just okay...,Didn't notice much of an effect controlling my oily hair. My wife likes it though...on her hair! Not what I expected...
3,There's not enough conditioner in the world...,"to make this product work on my hair. I have oily hair and within days, my hair was like straw even WITH the matching conditioner. It cleans your hair, just a little too clean for my hair I guess. So, if the right hair meets this product, I'm sure the rating would be higher. Me? I guess my hair's not oily enough for that kind of clean so I switched to something else."
5,Excellent Product,"Most shampoo's I've used are way too harsh or have strong cleansers.I have a really oily scalp and after using shampoo's the scalp got drier immediately and went from being oily to flaking and then getting oily again.Shampoos that claim to treat oily hair just use stronger cleansers. Oily scalp and hair is NOT necessarily any more moisturized than dry hair.This product works gently and naturally and I havent used another since.Also, strangely, my receding hairline (in the rear) has improved. My hair is definitely better than before."
4,An Unexpected Delight,I picked up the audio version. The reader is excellent and brings the author's rich use of language to life.
3,Honor's Kingdom,"Abel Jones goes to England to track Confederate activity there, and gets mixed up in a murder mystery.This is a competent historical mystery. Parry probably did well to get out of America for this one. The grotesqueries of contemporary London are well (if not over-) evoked, and since Parry showed in his last book that he currently writes Confederates as cardboard villains, getting away from them strengthens the book. It all resolves rather easily for Jones, but it is a pleasant read with some moments of humor.However, I think the author is capable of more than this. Jones is a strong character, with a powerful and engaging voice, but I'd like to see Parry create a protagonist capable of seeing the world in shades of gray. Jones doesn't change, and that makes four books about him, even though he's a well-conceived character, seem a little much."
1,time for a new character,"I loved Faded Coat of Blue. The books have been going downhill ever since. The last one I bought meandered through a convoluted other-wordly yarn in upstate New York. Isn't this the Civil war? I read this one after taking it out from the library on my military post. Give me a break. Maybe, Mr. Parry is just going through the motions because he signed on for a series. Try something new."
1,Worse than it needed to be.,"I only review the very good and the very, very bad books I buy. This was one of the worst. Poorly conceived, poorly excuted and very, very little reason to any of it."
2,Beautiful Prose Can't Save a Poorly-Plotted Story,"Owen Parry is a great writer, let me say that out front. He created a truly memorable character and has a rare gift for language. Unfortunately, those qualities don't always make for a good novel; that's certainly the case here. It's frustrating that Parry places his hero in a bizarre, over-complicated plot when the Civil War provides such rich ground to draw from. The opening chapter is excellent; wryly grotesque and involving, but things collapse after that. Too many plot threads, too many contrived situations, too little connection to history. The low point for this series so far."
5,Amazing book for anyone touched by adoption,"As an adoptee, I could relate to Kasey Hamner's book in very many ways. I almost felt like I had written it in some parts. Knowing that she went through the same events/issues that I did was comforting, especially the fact that she conquered them and is a healthy, productive citizen. Too many people only view adoption as a wonderful thing, something that every infertile couple (or fertile) should do. But have they ever asked an adoptee or read any of the books? I'm not saying that adoption is a bad thing, but for those of us whose birth mothers were forced by societal influences,or by family to give us up, there can be terrible results.I wish that everyone who knows an adoptee could read this book, especially adoptees who have reunited with birth family members, as I have. No one really understands unless they have been through it. It is a frightening and wonderful experience. Read this book and find out what it was like for her."
5,Undescribable Identification,"As a ""child of many"" I related on so many levels. I saw my birthmother and adoptive mothers in her b/mom and a/mom and found a wonderful sense of healing. I am a ""child of many"" and I am proud and happy to be alive. Thank you for sharing your life with us so beatifully and candidly. You have truly made a difference."
5,"A brilliant account of birth, love, and struggle.","The Language of Birth is a book of epic proportions and is sure to become the keystone of reading for anyone interested in birth. Professor Kahn has succeeded in the complex while graceful weaving of personal narrative, academic research, and poetry. Through Kahn's thorough research, she has created a platform for those with concern and interest in the fields of feminist studies/women's studies, modern obstetrics, traditional birthing practices, and parenthood to turn to. The Language of Birth must be read by academics and the lay reader alike. I give The Language of Birth five stars out of five!!!"
1,VERY POOR!,Unfortunately the content is very superficial and has been written by someone who is not familiar with the Turkish culture.
1,"Let's go for ""faithful"" rather than ""effective""","Attempts to moderate somewhat between the church growth advocates and the traditional side, but falls short on many counts. The title itself is a foretaste of what is to come, i.e. good advice on how to be more ""effective,"" such as people techniques, organization, etc., but why not concentrate on the more biblical concept: ""faithful.""Consider the Pastor Paul writing advice to Pastors Tim and Titus. Never does he talk about this quality and effectiveness and efficiency that most books deal with on pastors who want success. Teach the word purely. Be a bondslave to the gospel of Christ. Expect attack. Lean on the Lord. Sheep will safely graze and pasture, under a watchful shepherd's eye.Means means well in what he offers. Much good to combat the modern tendencies to lead the flock with more consideration of what the sheep want. I found him talking on both sides much of the time."
4,Not Bad!,"These flashcards are pretty good but there are some things I would exchange. I don't thing one of the first signs my baby needs to know is ball, I think grandma is more important. We just got them and my baby is only 5 months old so I don;t know how they will work but I do know the first thing I did was laminate them.(I got this idea from another reviewer!)"
1,signing w/2t,"My daughter loves to learn new words/signs, however, these were not ones we used regularly, so it was not as useful as I thought."
4,Easy to use!,"My husband and I love these cards. I think they will grow with my daughter because one side is the sign and one side is the word and a picture, so they'll be great for reading and spelling skills. There are some words that we probably won't use, but I like just having the cards. I have read articles on the benefits of signing and so I didn't really want another wordy book."
3,Okay flashcards,I got these for my son before he went to a daycare that used sign language every day. You have to be consistent in using the signs with them every day. But they're okay flash cards. I used the pictures on the front of the cards to teach him what they meant instead. He loved going through them and telling me what each thing was.
2,fairly Average Song,"i have heard this song quite a bit&still can't see what the big deal was?catchy basic beat nothing really great.His Voice is there.this song is like a Poor Man's ""The Way You Make Me Feel"" Michael Jackson."
4,USHER'S STRONG START,"USHER U REMIND ME IS A FANTASTIC SONG, THAT REALLY GETS IT POINT ACROSS. THIS SONG IS FOR EVERYONE GIRL OR BOY, A THUG IN NEW YORK, OR A COLLEGE KID THAT LIVES IN JAMESBURG NEW JERSEY. EVERYONE HAS HAD THERE HEART BROKE, AND IT HAS LEFT A SCARE. THIS SONG IS FUN AS WELL AS EMOTIONAL. THE KEY ELEMENTS THAT MAKE A HIT AND HOT SONG. GREAT SONG, THAT SHOULD BE A PIECE TO A GREAT ALBUM."
4,You remind me,The single You ''Remind Me of a Girl'' by Usher is a great CD. The song is one of the best ongs i have ever heard. about a man who loves a woman but can not be with her becuase she reminds him of a nother girl which he thought was the one for him. It is a sad and touching somg that woul will want to play over and over again for your self or you your boy/girl friend. the only reason i would not give it 5 stars is becuase it is a single CD and i would prefer if it contained more songs that that one.
4,Usher-U Remind Me,"I feel this is a GOOD single, however, there is another version of this song with some girls singing back to him that he reminds them of a guy that they once knew and it also features Method Man and others--->Now THAT version is GREAT! Unfortunately, I can't find it anywhere no matter how hard I search. Can anyone tell me how to get this version?"
5,THE BEST,This song is awesome!! It reminds me of my childhood and in k-5th grade. If you like Shaggy or Nelly then your gaurenteed to like this. I loved this song the first time i heard it! So i sugesst u to buy it and i think you will be happy with it!!
5,a must have for gangsta rap lovers....,This is a must have for gangsta rap lovers... Serious stuff. these guys need to be exposed!
3,Gives very basic information for a bridal shower.,"I purchased the book for help planning a baby shower. There is very little information for baby showers. Most of the book (about 3/4) is devoted to bridal showers. For this reason, the title is very misleading."
3,Lacks pictures,"I thought the information was helpful in that it provided a detailed planner, but I would have preferred some pictures. I enjoy getting ideas from actual pictures and there are none in this book, just a few very simple drawings."
2,No instructions!,"Good quality deck, but came with no instructions! I guess I need to buy another book to figure out how this deck works. Disappointed."
1,27 queens,i dont know why but for some reason when i got this thing in the mail it had 27 queens of hearts!
2,Would have been perfect but...,I got the deck and it was already opened and missing a few cards... not sure what happen wasnt even worth the time for me to report it.
1,A huge rip off.,"The title says it all.In here, it says that a dvd instruction and a link to a site will be sent along with the card. BUT, I did not receive any. The deck has a LOT of aces of spades, but not complete like a normal deck of cards. Ultimately, I could find no other use for the product but for dumbly playing with my baby cousin. I can't believe I wasted my money in this crap.Uggh."
4,Fun for a newbie to magic,This is a great starter for anyone interested in trying some magic tricks. I purchased this svengali deck and the svengali trick book for my husband and he likes it alot. I would highly suggest purchasing the book also when you purchase the cards because it will teach you a lot of neat tricks from the book. The items shipping fast and I would highly recommend this seller!
4,"Product just fine, but no instructions.","The product is just fine. Imagine buying a basic Hoyle deck from the store, the quality is just the same in my opinion. So no complaints there.However, I did not receive my instructions. Not really a big deal since you can just use google if you need anything.The product description says""You will receive the deck and the instructionsRed or BlueVideo instruction link included""I did however get this ""Video instruction link"", unless I suppose, if they were refering to the fortune inside a fortune cookie sized piece of paper included with a link to a website.Anyways, over all the quality, shipping, what I expected were all great."
3,Wrestling enzymes the old-fashioned way,"This book will do little to encourage people to renew their interest in metabolism - it has no point of comparison, for example, with Dan Atkinson's classic Cellular Energy Metabolism and its Regulation, which was packed with interesting and stimulating ideas on every page. It is ""dedicated to those who wrestled enzymes from tissues the old-fashioned way"", and that, alas, is just how it reads.As a book on metabolism it is adequate. However, the title mentions regulation, and it falls far short of what one would hope for in a book on metabolic regulation. Depending on one's taste and background one would expect some treatment of cooperative and allosteric interactions, of feedback inhibition, of protein kinases and phosphatases, and of the newer view of metabolic regulation that is emerging from work in metabolic control analysis. Of the last of these there is nothing; the other topics do get mentioned, but the treatment is skimpy."
4,really really good CD!!!,"I got this CD because of the classic ""Chevy van"" but after listening to a couple of times you learn to love all of the songs!!"
5,Great quality flash cards,"I ordered three sets of flash cards for my 2 year old son who has a severe verbal language delay. The cards are oversized, colorful and show on the opposite side an easy to follow picture and description of how to sign the word properly. The pictures are childlike which helps draw the attention of the youngster.I highly recommend these flash cards to any child who needs to sign as an alternate and/or additional means of communication."
3,"Helpful, but sometimes confusing","I used this book while visiting Venezuela, and I was able to identify quite a few birds. However, I found that some of the color plates are inaccurate, which made identification rather difficult at times. Several species (such as the Green Jay, some tanagers) are depicted with improper coloration- some were too pale, some too brightly colored and/or with incorrect markings. The book was very useful and I'm glad I bought it, but be aware that the bird you see may look significantly different in the book."
4,An essential book for Venezuelan birds,"Steve Hilty has done an outstanding job of making sense of the incredible diversity of bird life in Venezuela. This is by far the best guide to that area that you can buy. The only shortcoming is the arrangement of the plates -- they are all grouped together separate from the text -- with a bewildering array of numbers to cross-reference to the facing page of names. If you want to read the complete text and check the range map, you have to go to another page. Fortunately, the page numbers included on the page facing the plates are accurate, simplifying the process.The only downside for this book: it is much to bulky to carry around in the field, but there is probably nothing to be done about that given the number of birds involved. Be sure to bring a backpack if you plan to use this in the field."
3,O.K. But...,"This book is good for just identifying birds, but it does not provide information on behavior, breeding and feeding habits of the species."
1,the book never reached the destination,"I want to understand why don't yet arrive my book? I have been waiting one month and my book hasn't still arrived, Why?. I need that you return my money or a good solution. Please!"
1,not well made,"I was very disappointed when I received this item because it did not shuffle cards. It was very difficult to get it to take any cards, and then it only took cards from one side. I sent it back and got a replacement. That didn't work either. The top part between the stacks of cards was not attached and it appears there was a flaw either in the design or the one I got so that the pegs to go through the holes in the base to hold the top part on were not long enough or deep enough. I returned the second for a refund and bought one at a local store instead."
3,Card Shuffler,Works fine after I taped across the top to squeeze in the sides so the center top piece would stay in place.
2,Poor Quality.,"It is poorly designed because the center piece keeps coming loose. Therefore, the shuffle does not work most of the time.The sides need to be secured to the center divider top. I corrected this by inserting 4 small screws to hold the unit tightly, and then it worked."
1,Cheaply Made,"The first shuffler that I purchased was broken and the replacement, even though not broken, is a piece of junk. It will not keep itself together at the top so you have to hold it together and even then it will not work properly. I would not recommend this item to anyone."
2,Disappointed,This product is not as good as the prior shuffler I had. It gets hung up sometimes when it is shuffling. I would suggest another brand.
3,Card Shuffler,"This works okay sometimes. The cards get stuck a lot on one side. Sometimes the cards end up side ways or even upside down in the tray. But when you have to shuffle multiple decks, it still beat doing it by hand. We like the first one we bought through Amazon better. It cost a couple of dollars more and took 4 ""D"" batteries. We bought this one for friends."
3,card shuffler,"This card shuffler worked great for about three weeks, then it just quit. If you only use it once a week maybe it would last but if you use it regulary it will break. At least my one did"
3,Severe Osteoarthritis Knee,This product may be helpful to people with moderate arthiritis. I have severe osteoarthritis of the knee and it did nothing to eleviate pain.
4,Excellent collection of rare postwar Kyser band sides,"Collectables does it again. This collection brings together rare (mostly post-WW2) sides from a neglected period of the Kyser band. Some excellent forgotten tunes here, and fine vocals from the likes of Gloria Wood, Mike Douglas, cult-fave Lucy Ann Polk and, of course, Harry Babbitt. Excellent remastering, as on the recent Collectables' Eddy Duchin set. Small quibble: would love to have seen the inclusion of two of my faves from this period, ""Things Have Changed"" (fabulous Babbitt vocal on this obscure Hoagy Carmichael tune) and ""Dreamland"" (the superior flip of the inane ""A Trout No Doubt"" which was perversely included)."
3,Amazes but confuses,"3 1/2Darting in, out, and around all kinds of brilliance, the exciting jazz jammers can't seem to glue it all together in an undeniably consistent manner."
5,Another Awesome Effort by Diamond Rio!,"One More Day was well worth the wait! A fabulous collection of songs from a group known for its ability to select songs, this album shows this super group at its very best. Great harmonies, great musicianship from some of the best musicians in Nashville. If you've never bought a Diamond Rio album this is a great one to start with, although after you listen to this one, you will be back in here ready to buy many more!"
4,Trolling Motor,So far so good. It's probably a bit underpowered for my 17-foot Trophy center console but does fine on the sheltered creek where I do most of my fishing. It seems very efficient in terms of energy usage. It was hard to get reliable information on what size I should get for my boat.
1,Gonna rip you off,"Don't give your hard earned money to 3 losers like Fluoride,Ray & Peligro. The Dead Kennedys are officially DEAD. Buy a Lard cd."
4,A band at the height of their powers,"Tried hardcore in 1981s In God,and a more eclectic betterproduced mix of styles (psd).In hindsight too many different styles to take all fans with them and lyrics much more wordy,moving already to Biafra spoken word rants.Moon over marin,buzzbomb,riot and government flu are still brilliant,as are Dog bite and Nazi punks and the Rawhide cover version would have been top 20 uk if they'd wanted the fame..............A pair of brave,experimental records pushing themselves to the limits"
1,definitly the best DK album...,"...but buy it from alternative tentacles! otherwise, the money will go to the capitalist ex-members the have actually SUED ex-singer and songwriter Jello Biafra and WON. Jello is broke, support him! I myself added some money to his poor pockets when he performed with spoken word here in Sweden."
1,one more complaint,"Great CD, but . . .Jello is the Dead Kennedys. Almost all of the lyrics were written by him, and the instrumental quality of the rest of the band is, well, not the selling point. Supporting this rerelease is like buying a leatherbound guide to veganism - you could do it, but only if you had no interest in the message.There's nothing wrong with a recent budding interest, but please, go to a filesharing service or hunt down Alternative Tentacles releases."
5,Support the Manifesto releases.,"Ignore those who would have fans of the Dead Kennedys support only the Alternative Tentacles issues of Plastic Surgery Disasters/In God We Trust, Inc. and the other three discs in the DK catalog rightfully and lawfully licensed to Manifesto Decay Records. The Manifesto issue of Plastic Surgery contains the same tracks as the Altenative Tenatcles issue performed by the same band members. The only difference is the sound quality. The digitally remastered Manifesto issue simply blows the Alternative Tenatacles issue away. DK produced some of the best hardcore punk music, but the sound quality of the original CD product issued by Alternative Tentacles was and is flat. If you simply want to enjoy the quality of the music and not promote or support one band member versus another, the choice is simple; get the digitally remastered version and play it very loud."
5,boo-hoo Jello,"Jello ain't as punk as you all think.buy the remasters, not the Alternative Tentacles ones"
5,Loved this book!,"Baby boomers should read what's in store for us when we, too go to ""prison"" in an old folks home. Hopefully, we'll have a neighbor there just like Hattie. Written with humor and insight, it rang all too true to the characters I met while visiting my mother when she was an ""inmate."" Lot of truth to it.Wilder's also an inspiration to fledgling authors who say they're too old to write that book they've put away time and again. Not so. Go Effie go!"
5,This book is a true delight!,"This book is a true delight! Everyone (especially anyone over the age of 30, or anyone who has ever felt afraid of growing older, and/or of dying, should DEFINITELY read this book! I am 45, and it made me realize that life is truly just beginning for me! Kudos to Mrs. Wilder!"
3,MELODY IS NOT ENOUTH SMOOTH,"I LIKE THE TOPIC OF THIS CD.BUDDHA NATURE,THE EXPLAIN TO IT IS VERY GOOD.BUT I AM A LITTLE DISPOINTED TO THE MUSIC FROM THIS CD,IT IS NOT ENOUGH MELODY,A LITTLE BORE OF IT?"
4,San Francisco Gothic!,"I not much for gothics, but I admit that this one caught me up with its intrigue and coastal fog among the redwoods. Pre-Civil War San Francisco was extremely fascinating as well. Anyway, Felicity is besieged by ""accidents"" and doesn't know where to turn for help. She finally finds it...within herself. Great stuff. Two thumbs up!"
1,It doesn't get any worse,"This is the worst jump rope imaginable. If you want a jump rope of this quality go to the Dollar Store and by cloth line for $0.99 - it will make a better jump rope!I put the rope on a hook two weeks ago hoping it would eventually straighten itself out, but it still looks like the track of a drunken snake.The rope is way too light and will not work outside unless there is absolutely no wind at all.Also, be aware that the blue rope you are ordering is actually red.Before you spend [...] on this piece of crap consider burning the money!!!"
3,What's going on with that European holiday??,"l bought this cd because my mother used to put on 'It's so peaceful in the country' when guests were just about to arrive for dinner. The house would be sparkling, there would be something delicious cooking, the loungeroom would be bathed in soft lamp light...and this record playing soothingly in the background. Very happy memories!'It's so peaceful in the country' is just as l remembered it. It's a lovely record. l give that 4 stars.However it also comes bundled with 'European holiday' which is like a sound montage & radio play all rolled into one. After being soothed by 'it's so peaceful' to be attacked by that barrage is a jolt. Good for one listen for the novelty value but after that................???My advice is find a recording of 'It's So Peaceful in the Country' and make sure it doesn't have 'European holiday'! l give it one star, mainly for being a sound capsule from the fifties."
4,Cruising the Swedish Carribbean,"This is a great CD.I bought it after reading an article in Aftonbladet(a major Swedish Newspaper)about Magnus Carlsson. Barbados is a very talented band. The album has a mixture of songs in English as well as Swedish. Dont let this scare you away. If the music is good, you don't need to understand the words. And believe me, the music is good. There are songs most people will remember that have been redone with a delightful different sound. Songs like ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"",""Young Girl"", and ""Sway"". The songs in Swedish are excellent as well and if you listen close enough, you can understand some of the words as Swedish does have some similarity with English. Listening to this CD will put you in the mood for taking a cruise or at least a backyard luao.Its fun and delightfully refreshing. All in all, its a Fabulous collection of songs and I look forward to more from Barbados. ""Tack sa mycket Magnus och Barbados !!!!"""
2,Only works in certain room temps.,"So, if you have just come in from the cold, forget about it. You will show up as stressed. In fact, there have been very few times that I didn't register as stressed. I think it is just cold in my house. And if you house or office is air conditioned, don't bother."
2,Wisdom of the Tarot,I felt that this was a failed attempt to convey the esoteric truths of the Major Arcana of the Tarot. I'd recommend the works of Dr. Paul Case instead.
4,Cute Movie,This movie was a cute romantic comedy. It had a different twist to it which made it very enjoyable. It's a rom-com so you can't really take it too seriously.
3,okay,It was okay. I could not sympathize with the main character because she was not honest and then expected sympathy and understanding.
3,Pleasant but not especially memorable,"This is a rather predictable romantic comedy, a story already told hundreds of times. It's a satisfactorily pleasant way to spend an evening, but neither pioneering nor memorable. Did I enjoy it? Kind of. Do I recommend it? Well, sort of. What did I like about it? I can't really remember. What did I dislike? Not much of anything in particular. Probably not an especially helpful review, but this movie does not inspire me enough either way to lead me to greater helpfulness. Sorry."
3,My Girlfriend's boyfriend,It was good but I got lost the first time watching it. Definitely have to watch it twice to understand.
1,not a romantic comedy at all,"The movie is such a cliche, and bad acting. I don't find anything touching or funny, other than the actors try to sound smart. The plot is somewhat confusing intentionally set up by the writer who may think this is smart. There is too much trying to be witty and funny and it is really not. It is not worth wasting the time to watch it."
1,Funny in a pathetic sort of way,"First of all, the darn acting seems perfunctory, or maybe they did try...It's just that something seemed so unreal about it. Can you say cronyism... Also, the jokes and lines are corny. More thought could have been put into the script. Then there's the plot... where's the climax? and they could have made it clear that she was or wasn't sleeping with both of these two men at the same time. If so, I think it's kind of inappropriate for such a PG film. Lastly, the characters are Ugly! Even Alyssa Milano is losing that charm (no pun intended) she once had...maybe it's just age.Sorry, but I laughed and shook my head at the overall quality of this film."
1,REALLY BAD movie,"I am really surprised that anyone else liked this movie. I LOVE romantic comedies, and I did not enjoy this movie at all. The story could be believable but is not because of how it is written and directed. It's clear from the very beginning who she is going to choose, and it is never clear why she is even interested in the other guy. The movie spends hardly any time on that relationship. There is no chemistry between Alysa Milano and either of the male leads, which makes it even less interesting. The acting is flat as can be. I had never noticed that Alysa Milano had a kind of annoying voice and was fairly one dimensional in her acting, but there was so little else to focus on, I ended up focusing on that. Finally, the movie was not funny to me. I can laugh at almost anything, and there was really not much to laugh at.One thing I did like about the movie was the opening credits. I thought the way they did them was creative and original."
2,Seriously? The ending made no sense.,"I want to like this movie, parts are very cute and milano is her adorable self but the last part of the movie made no sense - it went 'inception' on you like you were suddenly dreaming. I have no idea what prompted the change in form but it caused you to have no real ending which was very disappointing."
1,"Boring, stupid, terrible, a complete waste of time.",I think this is the worst movie I've seen in all my life.I can't believed Alissa Milano did this to herself.
4,Pulling it Off - (Possible Spoilers),"It is difficult to review this movie without the possibility of giving something away, but I will try my best to not be too specific in the things I reveal.Midway into this movie, I found myself thinking, ""There's no way this movie can have a good ending."" Jessi was either going to break one heart or the other, and I didn't want that to happen. I found the characters engaging and found myself rooting for both Ethan and Troy. Daryn Tufts has done an excellent job helping me to identify with Jessi's dilemma.In the end, I found Tufts' solution to the problem to be creative - if not a wee bit cheap, but still, it works.This is a great movie and I recommend it. It made me feel like I was flying."
5,Cute Idea!,"This is a fun, cute movie that kept me guessing...which is not hard to do. HA!! The plot is creative, but if you're looking for Oscar-Winning performances, don't look here."
3,"Very good acting, but the story line was a little hard to figure out, but . . . .",. . . . . but that could have been my limitation. I'ts like a Lifetime Movie. But it was ok. :)
4,Cute,"This was a cute movie. It wasn't action-packed, but it did hold my attention. A bit confusing at the end, but overall, a good chick flick."
4,"Surprise, surprise...","I don't want to say too much, but the ending of this film totally surprised me. However, I'm also surprised that I stayed with it. I was getting really ticked off at the girlfriend's actions in the film. I was mad at the reviewers that called this a nice clean film because her actions weren't nice and clean to me -- the two-timing hussy. As I mentioned, I don't want to say to much and give away the ending. It's not the greatest film on earth, but it made me smile. That's all I can say without giving away the plot."
4,Good chick flick,I finally got to watch a movie by myself and the kind of movie that I wanted to watch. This is a good ckick flick. I did enjoy it
5,"Great, clean romantic comedy.",In light of the myriad of movies out there that could be AMAZING but are ruined with unnecessary sex scenes; this is a movie worth watching. You really fall in love with the characters and find it hard to decide how it should end. The creators did a fantastic job of bringing about a happy ending.
2,clean romantic comedy: yawn,"Yes, it is a clean romantic comedy, but it is boring. It doesn't need nudity or sex, it needs more compelling characters. The female character is particularly annoying to me -- the only time she seems special enough to warrant attention of two presumably great males is in the first two cafe scenes. Most all the acting comes across to me as weak, unconvincing. I pushed all the way through thinking it will liven up, but it never does."
2,not worth the effort,"this movie made absolutely no sense, there were very few funny or even relevant parts....very disappointed, i bought this because of Alyssa Milano, and she wasnt even worth watching in this film, again, VERY disappointed."
4,good movie,"The movie had a nice storyline enjoyed watching it....rooting for the underdog! Romantic, funny and heartfelt.....I would watch it again."
5,So cute in a cheesy way!,"I never write reviews, but this movie needs an exception. There are very few good clean romantic comedies out anymore. This movie is really worth watching. Yes it is super cheesy and very slow at times. But I very much enjoyed it. The end is worth it all!"
5,Excellent,"I enjoyed this book a lot. It is a very easy to read book. It covered many different feelings on adoption. I agreed with some views and some I completely disagreed with, but I am glad to have the chance to see how other members of the triad feel."
4,Tony swings with the Count,"Although there are only 10 short tracks for a total of a mere 25 minutes, I'm happy I purchased this album. It is in stereo and the sound is good. The tunes included may not all be that popular or ""hits,"" but just to hear Tony and the swingest band of all time is wonderful. I'm glad I added it to my collection of Bennett album."
4,30 years Old and Still engrossing,"I read this book in the seventies, as a high school student in the throes of science fiction and feminism. If you enjoy the stories of Philip Dick and the reversals of fortune common to many thrillers, AND can handle the slow-paced style of this author get this book used or wait for the June 2009 reissue. The concept of the super-computer may seem a little dated but the Ice Age references seem very topical in our climate-conscious culture. I loved the surprize of the ending which I will not spoil here and cannot beleive that no one snatched up the film rights given the success of Minority Report, Children of Men, and other speculative thrillers which required an active imagination!"
4,Recipes from the heartland,"This book was published 1968 through 1981, compiled by Vicki McCleskey and Dorothy Guy of recipes from S&W Employees , Shawnee Mission, Kansas, and was sold as a fundraiser for churches and schools. Spiral bound, 280 Pages, indexed, helpful hints, tips, many useful recipes that could easily be lost to time. This is the sort of cookbook usually found with some stains and flour gracing it's many dog-eared pages as the recipes are simple, basic home cooking that anyone could master."
4,Great Mystery Collection,Bad Girls is an excellent collection of mystery short stories. Who knew women could be so bad? All of the stories are good but a couple are really great. The endings are unpredictable and will give you a surprise. This book works well for mystery lovers who don't have time to read a lot but want to enjoy a good mystery quickly.
5,I Am Not Alone!,"Funny how Mrs. Andersen hits the feelings of being a WOW right on!! She writes with insight and humour....yet is also mindful of the grieving process as well.The time reading the book feels like time spent with a good friend discussing inner-most concerns. This book is entertaining and well written! Thank you, Julie Donner Andersen for being there for us when we need you most-reminding us that we are not alone!"
5,A Blessing to a Growing Population,"I applaud this ""first of a kind"" book for braving the controversy it has created and revealing honest, forthright, and true testimony about life as a WOW, or Wife of a Widower. For those women who have long suffered in silence, this book can serve as a wake up call that there is hope for such relationships, and healthy alternatives for dealing with so many of the periolous issues facing WOWs these days. And as people live longer and longer, this is an issue sure to face many thousands more than ever before. Thank God a book like this now exists to help such women through a tough time of transition!"
4,One Woman's Journey As the Wife of a Widower,This book was well written and very insightful. I would reccomend it to anyone who is about to embark on such a journey as this one.
1,Best Piece of Fiction on the Non-Fiction Shelf,"SAVE YOUR MONEY!! If you are in a relationship with a widower, buy any other self-help book, suggest your widower go to a grief counselor or a priest, but don't buy this book! It's a waste of money, time & most importantly, self-respect for the person involved with a widower. This lady writes from la-la land. What it should be entitled is ""How to be A Door Mat for A Widower"". If you see this book on the shelf or online ----- run in the other direction!! This book is not for a woman who has her own voice & doesnt' want to play second banana to a ghost!! BE FOREWARNED!"
5,"A Helpful Perspective into Understanding References to the ""House"" and the ""Late Wife""","I searched the Internet and found very little regarding dating a widower and how the loss of his late wife would impact our relationship. I wondered if my feelings and emotions were ""normal"" as to the things of the late wife's in the home, the fact that it was ""their home"" and everything that goes along with ""the house"" and her ""presence"" in the house. Also, his frequent references to his late wife and the long history he and she had together, as compared to our ""brief history.""This book was extremely helpful in putting things into perspective and emphasizes that it is something that you work thru and not just something that happens overnight. Some give and take has to happen with both partners as well as a great deal of understanding from each."
5,Read this book GOW's and WOW's,"Julie-Donner Andersen writes for those of us trying to make a life with a widower. The title says it all! The past is always perfect and the present is pretty tense, if you ask me...Julie is insightful, forgiving and kind. All these qualities and more are needed to survive the grief issues, co-parenting and friendship reconfigurations as a WOW or GOW.Thanks for the help, Julie!"
1,If you have $... to waste...,"Send it to a therapy fund for the spouse or step-children of a WOW who employs Ms. Anderson's tactics. They will surely need it if they are subjected to a ""WOW"" who follows her lead.In Ms. Anderson's ""extensive research,"" she apparently learned nothing about compassion, understanding, and giving of one's self to soothe the sorrow of someone they love who became unmarried by death and not by choice. ..."
5,Very Insightful,"This book gives great depth in understanding Wives of Widowers.I don't feel so alone and know I can work through my insecurities. Also, I really enjoyed her sense of humor!"
1,"Buyer, beware!","This'book'is merely a collection other womens' experiences, strung together with her own uninformed, judgemental and patronising 'words of wisdom'. She portrays herself as a mother earth, appealing to vulnerable women in relationships with Widowers, as hers is virtually the only reading material available. Her only qualification appears to be having married a widower following her failed first marriage. Woopy Do! Not a good reason to buy it though and like the other reviewer, I wonder if Mrs DA seeks the permission of those who have shared there innermost thoughts with her via her blog, before publishing her own take on them! The tag line for the author 'helping wives and girlfriends of widowers since 1997' - helping them to what one might ask!! Get thoroughly depressed reading this sanctimonious claptrap one might venture. Save your money."
5,An absolute Godsend!,"This book is a Godsend for anyone contemplating a relationship with a widower, or already in a relationship with someone who has previously lost their partner. The author writes with the compassion and understanding of someone who has been there. She has thought of every type of situation and often complicated scenarios that arise, which can be difficult to handle.This book is like a guidebook to help you ease your way through these obstacles, providing invaluable advice and finding solutions to help resolve sensitive issues. The chapters cover ethics and protocol and the author pays meticulous attention to details and issues that can often be overlooked.I think that the review from ""book critic"" must have been submitted by someone with a personal vendetta against Julie Donner Andersen. Maybe a poor writer who hasn't achieved such great success as Ms Andersen?"
1,It's a comic book!,"Before you buy this, you should know, it is a comic book. I think it is referred to as a graphic novel but I missed that in the description and was very surprised to find little text. The stories are reasonable but if you are in the mood to settle down with a good story, forget it, it's very disconcerting to read."
1,30 Years of Trash,"This may be the most overrated band ever. I had been reading good reviews of these guys for years so decided to try this one. Bad choice. It's derivative and, most of all, boring. Everything they try to do is done better by others. Avoid at all cost."
5,His best album,"It is extremely frustrating to see poor reviews of this album. I believe this is by far Phil Ochs's best album. Phil was extremely affected by the events in Chicago, and this heartfelt album demonstrates the emotions that he was feeling. He put every ounce of energy into his songs, with every bit of anger or depressed feelings that could to win over the audience and get them to take an even stronger stand against injustices and lack of freedom. In other albums, in contrast, he sang songs with a mood of passive acceptance and hoped the audience would leave having learning something positive. While in this album he consistently said at the beginning of songs ""I don't remember the words [or the lyrics] to this song,"" it takes a closed-minded critic to mock that instead of simply enjoying the messages that he had to offer."
2,"Not quite there, at all","Oh dear. A disheartening, disappointing album that should never have been released. Phil Ochs, obviously shattered by the events in Chicago, stumbles through his live show, rambles through his between-songs introductions, rarely making sense, and -- especially on the slower songs -- loses the tune entirely. Saved by a stunning version of ""Another Age"" that renders this song timeless (someone, quick -- cover that tune!)and an equally brilliant ""The World Began in Eden and Ended in Los Angeles"", but otherwise his version of ""The Scorpio Departs But Never Returns"" is distressing, and he absolutely murders ""Changes"", veering off-tune repeatedly. This could not have been a pretty sight, and Michael Ochs' observations on the concert are far, far off of the mark."
4,kirk's liquid Castile,great product and a little goes a long way. So much better than the other castiles.
4,A GOOD PRODUCT,"I DO LIKE THIS PRODUCT AND USED IT FOR MONTHS UNTIL WINTER CAME AND I STARTED USING WELEDA. MY SKIN IS SO MUCH SOFTER AND LESS IRRATABLE WITH THE WELEDA PRODUCTS, AND THEY DO NOT SEEM, HARSH AND AS DRYING IN ANY WAY. KIRK'S IS A BETTER CHOICE THAN MOST BUT THE GERMAN'S (WELEDA, DR. HAUSCKA (SP), AND LAGONA) SEEM TO KNOW THEIR STUFF WITH SKIN/BEAUTY CARE."
5,World's Funniest Record Of All time,"Please excuse the hyperbole - but this series of Klein's comedic writing is, to my taste, the funniest stuff ever conceived. 'Juergen's Myasthenia', '100% undetectable hairpiece', 'Ever Record Ever Recorded' EVERY BIT on the album 'The None News News' - EVERYTHING IS ABSOLUTELY CLASSIC! I laugh every time I hear this work. Robert Klein has more wacky, kooky, zany, stuff crammed into this album than ANY other comedian... EVER... on any other album. THIS IS TRULY WHAT HUMOR IS ALL ABOUT... Sorry for the shouting - but I'll never hear anything else as funny, as long as I live. God bless Robert Klein - he is the greatest of all time."
4,"Yeah it is moldy, but still funny.","He is one of the best stand-ups of all time. If you lived his bits they are probably a lot funnier. But the National Anthem, First Time Stoned & Final Record Offer still are relevant. Watergate was & still is Hilarious."
5,Strong finish; most rewarding of the three books,"If you're read the first two books in this series, you know you're going to like this one. If you haven't read the first two you should, at least in order to get into the flow of the story thus far.Your reward will be that this is the most ""magical"" of the books, and will be the one that most closely reflects actual Welsh tales. It's also the most exciting, and the closest to stirring ""high fantasy"".And after you finish this, try Susan Cooper's ""Dark is Rising"" series."
4,Good read for older Harry Potter fans,"Like other reviewers, I liked the Charlie Bone series better, but this series is still well written, and is still a good read. It actually got my 10-yr-old son to put Harry Potter down for a few days! LOL He did find the 3rd book a bit confusing-I think it's better for kids interested in dating because of all of the romance complications involved that one just can't understand until one has had a broken heart. This book also has some creepy parts. I had nightmares after the section about the cruelty to the horse Glory!While the 1st two books can stand on their own, this book needs to be read last, or it's just too hard to follow. These 3 reasons are why I'm rating it a little lower than the 1st 2 books.I liked the information on Wales. It brought back memories of my visit there. I think it's a great way to introduce the country to kids."
2,Her voice completely gone on this album.,"This CD is really only for collectors who want to hear this particular concert. However, be prepared, Chavela's wonderful voice is not to be found on this album. All the songs are familiar, but the voice isn't. Her voice cracks constantly, forcing her at times to speak the words rather than sing them and to remake the song to avoid the difficult notes. The crowd is boisterous too often calling out to her in the middle of a song-- which makes the CD hard even harder to listen to.You would not give this CD to introduce him to Chavela. There are much better albums for that: the hard to find ""Volver, Volver"" being the one that most springs to mind. As I mentioned previously, this CD is only for collectors who feel they must have every last album of hers. If you think you're one of them, I'd still suggest that you try to find a site where you can download and listen to a track before committing to this album."
4,"""Good singer- But where's her only Hit ""","Funny, I've seen two different collections from Jill Corey and both are missing the only hit she had. It was called ""Love Me To Pieces"", out in the early 50's, and you'd think whoever put this and the other collection out would have known and included it with the other songs. Jill is best at upbeat songs,this CD is half and half, I don't care for the slow stuff, but this was the way the original was released. However by omitting that one song, which was a Huge hit, this CD is just missing a spark."
5,I'm using this as a substitue for lubing my Break Barrel nitro compression chamber,All works well. But.... the contents fluid amount is advertised incorrectly. It showed up and oz. short. Other than that. Great product.
4,I've heard it now....,"and I love it..... it takes a while to get used to it even when you're expecting the punk rock.... but after a while you wish it was much, much longer!"
1,Where's Amy?,"Those of us who love Amy Ray are accustomed to hearing her incredible lyrics delivered with that wonderful smokey voice. She has the ability to paint pictures in your mind that you never forget. Stag may have offered the listener a new group of songs to learn, but with the exception of Johnny Rottentail, I understood only a word here and there of the cuts that followed. The engineer pushed the instruments to the edge of distortion and the vocal line was the loser. This album could have benefited from an included text but it was not there. I will keep Stag for the cool cover photo, but I am sorry to have missed so many of Amy's songs."
3,Haven't heard it yet....,"but looking at other reviews, listening to the samples and full tracks,and combining my thoughts on Amy and Emily I can say that I won't be suprised when I buy it. Amy has always seemed to me like she was driven more towards rock than folk, it's as if Emily keeps Amy from rocking too hard. This isn't a bad thing... we all like the product: Indigo Girls! I was expecting this CD to have more rock than Indigo Girls music usually does, and it seems like I was right (my friend [she's always liked Amy's style of music better than Emily's] was also expecting this and you should have see her face when she heard the ""scary banjo"" on the first track). I hope that my fellow IG fans and I enjoy Amy's solo CD as much as some of the other reviewers have.PS. I'm aware that this review probably hasn't helped anyone but that's ok...."
1,not surprised...but still dissapointed,"i had a feeling this cd was going to be less than great. i am a long time indigo girls fan and i just had a feeling about this. i've been following amy for many years. as far as i'm concerned, the actual music (not just on this album, but the last IG album as well) has become less musical as her songs become a mere medium for her to voice her liberal politics. i for one am tired of the whole ""angry liberal folk singer"" schtick by now. remember the good ol' days of Blood and Fire and Reunion? she used to write some great tunes. she hasn't really written anything in the past few years that has moved me.this album lacks beauty. it has no distinguishable qualities, other than the first track. i beleive ms. ray has joined the ranks of political singers such as ms. difranco...another folk singer led away from the actual music by the desire to spout liberal politics from the highest tree."
3,generic ibuprofen - what's to say?,"Single dose packets of analgesic for my various first aid kits. I don't get headaches that often, so mostly this kind of thing just sits around until it expires, but it is a handy size to fit in a first aid kit."
2,"Superb form, distressing content.","Being a dog lover but not a dog owner who believes that it is cruel to keep most dogs in an urban environment, and especially a large dog in a flat as the author did, I found this memoir not to be my cup of tea. Humans are portrayed in it as curious, rather unsympathetic creatures, whilst the dog at the center of his love, is romanticised despite the loving detail with which the author describes the bodily functions of the animal. I can understand though, its appeal to those with an obsession with their dog who find humans too argumentative, contrary or difficult. An instance of ""horses for courses"" so to speak."
2,Overrated,"The author's devotion to his pet, Tulip, and his determination to attend to her well-being were very touching. I also appreciated how he admitted to his mistakes in ""dog-rearing."" However, it seemed to me that all he talked about were the dog's biological functions, be it elimination or the reproductive cycle. There's nothing wrong with the topics but they took up the entire book--in particular, he went on for chapters about the dog's heat cycles. I started flipping through the pages very quickly toward the end."
1,Good kindling if you have nothing else,"I adore dogs, and German shepherds are among my favorites. It takes a remarkable lack of writing talent to make one of them a colossal bore, but the author of My Dog Tulip achieved that dubious honor. There may be a more mind-numbing book somewhere, but I have been fortunate enough to avoid it. The only reason I gave it one star is that I couldn't give it fewer."
1,Disappointment,"I read a review of this book a few months ago in a dog magazine. It sounded good, I made a note of it. I must say the book has been a disappointment to me. I agree with two of the reviewers before me--the book lost its punch in last half with the endless breeding babble. Also I obtained a cheapened and altered book from the one I saw pictured in the review. I would say this book is over rated and over priced."
3,Possibly good for potential dog breeders,"I liked this book, although as a dog owner I found myself shaking my head and shocked at many of the things that were done with this dog... I do think this is a great book for anyone who is thinking of breeding their dog as it gives a good account of the trials of breeding, raising puppies, and the problems that can occur for the pups and mother."
1,Definitely not a fan,"I read this book for an animal studies course I was in. I am also an avid animal lover who owns pets so I thought I would be able to relate to this book. Boy was I wrong. I did not like the parts where he described the whole dog mating and reproduction very in depth (like literally describing the parts). It's not that I was disgusted about it or anything, I just felt it unnecessary and not my thing. I also didn't like how he treated the dog in some parts and just irresponsibly dealt with the puppies. It's like he went through all this work so Tulip could get pregnant than just didn't care about her young. I was left thinking, what was the point? So she could experience mating and pregnancy once in her life? At the end I didn't get the point of the book, it felt like a waste of time to read."
4,Nature vs Culture,"A very interesting and well-written observation and meditation on the interaction between humans and animals, in this case, dogs. It describes ,in a very detailed and sometimes clinical fashion, how Tulip's owner observes and tries to regulate, either by helping or counteracting, his dog's needs and instincts. The real love between the two is based on misunderstanding what the other desires and is trying to say in its own language (peeing rituals for instance). The tone of the last chapter is more somber as it suggests that we, as humans, are as much part of the natural world, untamable, subject to sickness and death just as animals and trees are."
3,A Slow Read,It has had great reviews but this book was not for me. I read each word and this one was hard to read.
1,Hair-raising; not for dog lovers,"Well, a lot has been said about others about the grittiness of detail. I work as a vet tech & have 3 dogs, so I'm used to all that sort of thing but his descriptions even bother me. You wonder if the guy is quite right in the head. After going thru all sorts of misadventure trying to breed her, and watching the birth with fascination and tenderness, he immediately goes for a bucket to drown some pups because he's just realized that he can't have that many dogs in his apartment. Trying to take into account that this all took place a long time ago (by the standards of the dog behavior & training culture), this book still offends me and plain old gives me the creeps."
5,beautiful ring,"This is a beautiful ring, with bright colored coral and great carving on the sides. It was shipped very quickly and well-packaged. I have ordered from them before and since, and they have consistently high quality."
5,"Wow! Amazingly beautiful, uplifting music!","I love this CD! It's incredible! The music is intoxicating, Yofiyah's voice is inspiring and I keep singing the songs long after the CD has ended. I play it every evening to wind down, let go of my day and lift my spirit. If you like Krishna Das, Wah, Jai Uttal or Deva Premal, you will LOVE this CD. Yofiyah's lovely voice opens the heart. The exotic music conjures both India and the Middle East with it's unique blend of instruments: tabla, harmonium, oud, frame drum, and more. The ancient text from the Kabbalah resonates deeply. It is extremely powerful. I'm so glad I found this CD. It is deep, beautiful, ecstatic--a true gem."
5,Great Expectations,"Pip,a poor orphan boy living with his sister and her husband, who is the village blacksmith, wishes for the new world to live life of a gentlemen in. As if an answer to his wishes, Pips learns from Mr. Jagger that he has been given an enormous quantity of money from a secret benefctor, this money is enough to live the life of a wealthy gentlemen in London. There he stayes with Herbert Pockt. When he sees Estella the girl of his dreams, the adopted girl of the rich, Miss Havisham. To find out who his benefactor and what happenes with Estelaa you have to read this truely great story for it is called ""Great"" ""Expectatons."""
3,"not her best, but still ahead of her time","good first chapter, leading you to think this is a typical Jackson scare story, mousy girl, mean aunt, then what? Instead you get a kaleidiscope of Jackson attempting to show: multiple personailty, a dunken mother, a mean aunt, child molestation (hinted at) and interesting conversations betwen all four perosnalities later in the book. This is an uneven attempt at psychology, and Jackson is fasinating in her unevenness. Some dark humor, the tacked on happy ending, but still Jackson certainly knew the dark side and she was way ahead of her time (40's 50's writer)."
3,"Starts great, loses steam","The first chapter is wonderful, thoroughly creepy. But that's the high point of this book. Jackson's sense of humor shows through is some great parodies of bombastic language, but overall this is a light entry to her canon."
4,Needs More oomph,"There is no doubt of Shirley Jackson's recurring genius and writing style in this book, it had a great initial blow, but it needed more power in the follow-up.Good,smooth, story-line, strong characters, interesting ending.From Sam Flowe's Internet School Of Writing:A+"
4,his most mature work todate,"...i've had the chance to listen to it thru a friend and i must say this is his most mature work todate.unfortunately not all his albums are available internationally.if you want to check out his past work,try out ""eric gadd-greatest hits"" if it's available in your area..."
2,Good quality egg,"The ball I was sent is not even close to round, but the kids don't seem to mind. Other than not being round it is a decent ball.Follow up: The ball continued to get worse over time. Also our school purchased some other playground balls made by Tachikara and they also became egg shaped. I would recommend buying some other brand."
4,Not too bad,Considering the overall age of this game it is still quite entertaining. The graphics are acceptable and the replay device let's you see what happened fairly well. Would have been nice to have a playbook or a function to see the diagrams larger and longer than in play calling mode. I play against the computer and allow the game to generate the action so I don't have to use all the keypad responses. It takes a bit of time to get a grip on the strengths and weaknesses of teams from 1994-5 but the game is consistant when certain matchups are repeated. All in all it's not too bad.
2,American Chopper - Season 4 - Part 1,"This set includes 3 disks with 2 shows per disk, total of 6 episodes. The episodes are:42. Carroll Shelby Bike 1 original air date: 1/31/200543. Carroll Shelby Bike 2 original air date: 2/7/200544. Lincoln Mark LT Bike 1 original air date: 2/14/200545. Lincoln Mark LT Bike 2 original air date: 2/21/200547. Junior's Dream Bike 1 original air date: 3/7/200548. Junior's Dream Bike 2 original air date: 3/14/2005I believe these sets are privately produced by Amazon, definitely not by the Learning Channel's production company. This is a bare bones set. NO special features, not even a disk menu to choose episodes on each disk. Discovery did much better with seasons 1-3, these new sets leave much to be desired, and at $5+ per episode, the price is steep. Come on Learning/Discovery- you can do better than this!!!!!"
3,Not bad,"This was kind of a let-down because I didn't realize they split up the seasons into two parts to get more money. I didn't mind paying $30 or $40 per season, but now I think they're just getting greedy."
2,Outdated Book With A Little Bit of Useful Information,"This started out seeming like a pretty good book, but as I got further into it just got more and more out of date. Subjects like computers, Internet, satellite systems, and RV systems are just really old. I wish I had paid the [...] bucks for a used version of it because that was about all it was really worth to me. I could have probably found most of this information on [...]. Sorry, but this book was a waste of money."
4,Must reading if your are considering this lifestyle,"I like the fact that this book tells you how it really is and cautions you to think through all kinds of things I never considered about life on the road. My husband and I decided it's not really for us at this time. Better to know now, than after we have sold our house and worldly goods!"
4,lots of information,"This book was very helpful with information. I especially liked how to find a job while traveling, and storage for the camper. There is so much to take in account for and this book although older still has a lot of good information for newbies."
4,Gives practical advice and will shift your paradygm.,"A must read for anyone thinking or going full-time in the RV lifestyle. Great advice on preparing for this major change in both living and thinking. For example, the author advises that full-timers not drive more than 200 miles a day. Why? Because full-timers truly do have all the time in the world, so why wear yourself out trying to get to a destination when the journey is the most important thing. Other topics are also valid like the pros and cons of giving up a permanent residence; how insurers treat full-timers; whether you'll want to or need to work as a full-timer and options for same. Some of the material is a bit dated. However, this is a must read primer for would-be full timers."
5,Solid Information for Living Full-Time in an RV,"My husband wanted to try full-time RVing, but I was too attached to having a house. Anyone trying to make that decision, needs to read this book.It helps you figure the costs of such a lifestyle and how to deal with mail, licenses, and medical issues without a home base. Two chapters cover selecting an RV for full-timing. Then it addresses adjusting the RV to your special needs and what to do about storage. Five chapters cover the care of the RV (electrical systems, water, sewage, etc.). There are sections on driving, security, and selecting campgrounds.We're talking about more than 500 pages of solid information here. It's essential for full-time RVers and quite useful for even part-time RVers."
4,Older book but some good information,"This is an older book on RV living and as such it doesn't have much if anything in the way of solar for power, satellite dish for TV and computer use or other off the grid living information one needs in 2007+. But the information on mail, medical, fees for various things, and what type of floor plan for an RV vs a trailer are helpful. Am still looking for a newer book and one that speaks to the single woman who travels in an RV and alone."
2,Crappy,"They were a double sided pen... just wood and not metal. The Stripes on both ends are horribly painted on... ehh, pay for what you get."
3,Good Product for efficient time,I have had a great help scanning the bussines card that the buyer give me. Now I don't have to dedicate a large time typing all the the business card. Only I scan it the sync with my outlook and finally I scan with my smartphone.
5,Good Plain Standup,"If you like standup comedy, but not as dirty as kinison yet not as ""weird"" as Steven Wright, this album is a must have- it's just Good plain smart and entertaining obsorvational humor... Robert Klein is a master at his field, and I own over 200(!) comedy albums of all genres, so I think you should take my word for it..."
4,BBA (Before Big Al),"I am currently reading Bob Klein's autobiography *the Amorous Busboy of Decatur Avenue: A Child of the Fifties Looks Back* (ABB) during the course of which I decided to pick up this CD. The *Child* CD brings back memories of under-your-desk-diving Civil Defense drills of the 1950's and other not-quite-Kodak moments of our lives. The 20 years after book, like the man, is a more developed and seasoned fruition. You could just skip this unformed and abridged *Child* Klein and proceed directly to ABB on CD, but then you would miss the groovy Akroydian looking young Klein on the case cover.The routines on this *Child* CD were compiled in 1973 - long before Klein-as-Big Al started selling stuff on the TV sudser *Sisters.* If the Powers That Release are reading this, wouldya please release *Sisters* on DVD?! /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"
1,missing a page or two........:(,I loved the story but the book was ruined and it all rhymed. Don't know what to do about it.
5,My children want to hear this one again and again!,"My five year old loved predicting what the rhyming words would be at the end of each phrase the first time we read it. Now he just loves to recite the rhymes along with me. The illustrations are wonderful, colorful, and you'll be surprised each time you read it!"
3,Not a winner with me,"Some rhyming books work. Others... don't. They sound trite, or forced, or just awkward. This is one of them.Worse, I don't think I quite like the message. You should have two of everything so you can have friends? I guess it's not a bad message, but why did it even need to be said? When is this ever going to come up? Seems like a long way to go to get to ""sharing is good!"" And who makes friends by finding random strangers on the street and bringing them home (and then changing everything to suit their needs)? What about looking for common interests or something?"
4,One Of Each ~ MAry Ann Hoberman,"This is a great book for children. It teaches sharing and how to make friends. I like this book becuase Oliver learns about how to treat others. He doesn't know what life is like, becuase he has always lived by himself and never talks to any of the people in his town. He has one of everything in his house. He doesn't know that his house was only made for one person until he makes a friend and invites her to his home. Peggoty Small tells Oliver that his home was made for one person and she couldn't live with him.My favorite character was Peggoty Small. I like her becuase she told Oliver Toliver what she tought. She wasn't afriad to tell him about her feelings, she just told him flat out what she thought. Even though she hurt Oliver's feelings, she old him anyways because she thought he should know the truth. This book teaches kids how to make friends, and how to share what you have with others."
2,Doesn't do anything that we can figure out,"Lots of money for a product that doesn't seem to do anything. No driving or pull back action on the wheels, the cycle falls over if not held, can't figure out how to launch this missile, the picture shows a red light on the Buzz arm that doesn't exist on the product....very very disappointing."
3,Gotta Love Rhino!,"As a fan of Rhino Records for many years I was elated when they started this series years ago. This was the 70s collection with songs that you couldn't find on any other compilation - the quirky ones that you remember hearing on AM radio, had the 45 but wasn't on the ""most popular"" list. For example: Sky High by Jigsaw (which I remember hearing in 1975) and Convoy by C. W. McCall (which I had the 45 rpm of). This isn't my favorite volume of the series but nonetheless, a volume that should be in your collection.Please note! The cassette versions are different from the CD release. There are ""Bonus Tracks"" on the CD that are not found on the cassette."
1,SONGS MISSING FROM CASSETTE THAT ARE SHOWN ON LISTING,"I was disappointed when I received the cassette I ordered as I opened the package. Same label cover as shown on order page, same songs, except that there were 2 songs missing from the cassette:RockyI'm Not LisaWhat's up with that????"
2,"there are weeds, and then there are weeds","Doubtless there are some good suggestions in this book, e.g. the chapter on drip irrigation. However, if your garden area is infested with nut-grass (Cyperus rotundus) you can forget about the method the author propounds. I covered my garden area not with newspaper but with cardboard boxes, broken down and laid flat. That was four months ago. The nut-grass wasn't even fazed; it punched right through the cardboard and the 4"" of mulch on top of it like those impediments weren't even there. I'm sure this method works on ""kinder, gentler"" weeds, but in my context the ""weedless"" thesis is useless."
3,Writing Spead Clearly Listed,"To the fellow who said not to buy this product because the manufacturer does not specify the writing speed --- hey, fella! Just click on the button for the technical specifics! It says clearly that it writes at 4x speed. So if you don't like 4x speed, don't buy the darned product!"
2,risky purchase,vendor fails to specify the max writing speed for this media. You might get stuck with 4x media. It might be 10x. Who knows?Don't buy this unless you can be sure.
3,Missing a vital track...,"This anthology of The Lords Of The New Church is drastically missing one of their greatest and most successful songs - ""Open Your Eyes."" I recommend instead that you attempt to track down the self-titled debut, as it has the band's best and most popular songs on it. The Lords Of The New Church are a fantastic and more light hearted example of the great heyday of early Goth and Post Punk music, and they will make a very important addition to your collection. This Anthology is a good start if the debut CD is that difficult to find."
1,Popped in the first 15 minutes,got hole first 15 minutes and is small for $7.00 for a small ball thought it would last longer disappointed
4,So far so goo,Bought some of these for my daughter's preschool. None have popped in the first month. They seem very heavy duty and good quality.
5,Great product for extended wear.,I am a professional firefighter and these drops keep me from clawing my eyes out after sleeping in my contacts for 48-72 hours. These are the best eye drop I have ever used for refreshing your eyes during contact wear.
5,I love this product!,"I can't find this product in stores anymore, and it seems to be the only thing that really works for my gas permeable lenses!"
1,Poorly shipped! Came in pieces!,"I ordered two barrels, both came shipped in a truck, as expected, with no wrapping or protection of any kind. Normally one would think this is OK since it is just a barrel. One of them was OK and the other one had fallen apart with three hoops missing. We had to wrap it in plastic wrap to hold the remaining parts together to unload it in one piece! Very disappointing and very expensive!Also they are not the same size so if you are expecting to use them as a matched pair think again, the intact one is about 6"" shorter than the pieces of the other one."
1,NOT A WHISKEY BARREL!!!,I have been hunting for a whiskey barrel for a friend for a special birthday gift. It just arrived and smells of wine! Very disappointed!
2,This is a wine barrel,"I have seen a lot of barrels, both whiskey and wine. The barrel pictured here is a wine barrel."
2,Not so fabulous,"This video had a good review so I bought it. After watching it for 5 minutes, I couldn't keep my eyes open. I teach ESL so I realize that the teaching methods have to be at a certain pace, but the pace of this video was too slow. If I were an ESL student, I wouldn't want to sit through it."
5,If You Like The Lynne Arriale Trio You Will Love This CD,"I bought this from iTunes, the whole album, and I like every cut. Problem is there are messed up places in the iTunes version on several cuts so I am buying the CD from Amazon. Great stuff ! Way to go Lynne Arriale Trio !"
5,Great Aerator! Good Price! Sturdy!,I ordered this from Amazon since my local Home Depot didn't have it in stock. I followed other reviewers advise and pre-watered lawn but only for about 30 min. since there was some rain fall the day before. Very easy to use and sturdy. My husband and I had no problems aerating the lawn. This is a definite must have before you apply weed & feed.
2,Did not work for me,"I have clay soil. It immediately clogged the tines. You can keep making holes with the tines clogged, but since the soil is not being ejected, all you are doing is further compacting the soil below. You may think you are helping your lawn, but you are actually making it worse. I suspect this is a good tool if you have soil that is dry, or sandy, and therefore likely to eject from the top. With my type of soil, which is fairly common, it was basically useless. Please check your soil before spending your hard-earned money on this."
5,Worked flawlessly for me,"I was nervous about the clogging after reading the reviews, but after using it a few times, it has worked flawlessly for me. It never clogged once. If the plug didn't come out during a push, I just just lifted, pushed again in the next spot and it would come out then. There wasn't the need to clean it out or unclog once. I used it a few days after a rain, so that probably helped.It is definitely a manual, slow going process, so expect to take some time. But if you want to save money and are ok with doing a large area over a few times (or are ready for hours of back breaking labor if you want to do it at once), this works well."
1,Garbage.,"Live in a creek bottom in central texas - soil is very silt-y and can get extremely compacted in high traffic areas. Figured this little guy would help uncompact the various dog trails around my yard.Totally useless. The ""tines"" on the end just fill with compacted soil, no cores ever come out the top. After cleaning out the tines, you get one, perhaps two presses into the ground before it just starts to bounce off unless you throw your entire weight on it and jump repeatedly.Of course, if you throw your weight on it repeatedly, like I did, you'll just bend the handles and the bar between the tines at the bottom.I ended up grabbing my pitchfork to finish the job, and hucked this thing in the garbage where it belongs."
3,"It Works on Moist Lawn, but Broke Quickly","The handle stem broke at the weld where it attaches to the fork under normal usage within the first 20 minutes. Gave three stars instead of one because I was able to custom design a handle that allows me to use it if I handle it carefully. Even at my quick pace it took hours to do my 125 X 75 lawn. However, the results were great."
4,"Serves its purpose, but cheaper elsewhere","This aerator works as it's intended, and wetting the lawn half a day before coring does make it much easier. We have clay underneath the lawn, so the part that was dry was quite hard to core through. It's been a week and a half, and we can see some green grass coming out of the brown patches now. And in response to the person that mentioned it's hard to empty out the holes, you don't need to empty it, just keep pushing it into the ground. Each dig pushes out the dirt from the prior dig. After you're done, just stand up a stick on the ground and push through it to empty the hole, simple as that.Having said all that, I did see a very similar corer/aerator at home depot for $20. Wish I had bought that one.Also, a word of advice - stay away from the 4-prong aerator. It's hard enough to push through the 2-prong, I can't imagine the 4-prong working too well."
3,Be careful,"This aerator works great. It's a little time consuming but if you do a small area at a time, it's worth using. My only complaint is that when I received it, I used it that night - it worked great, and the following morning. Unfortunately, the handle snapped that morning. You have to be careful and not put too much pressure on the handle. Use your foot on the core base to drive the cores into the ground."
1,Very poorly made,"I used this product for three minutes before one of the tubes bent. I was able to bend it back and use it for another minute before it bent again. The tubes aren't even welded around the entire tube, only on two sides, hence the bending and eventually breaking. i returned it the first day. I found the Fiskers Aerator online, ordered it, and it appears to me that it will last forever(it is built to last a lifetime). I whole-heartedly recommend the Fiskers brand aerator."
1,Always clogs,I spent far more time cleaning this with a screwdriver than actually aerating the lawn. It requires rigorous cleaning every 4 pushes.
5,Great Where the Large Aerator Can't Get To,"It worked very well for thew first time I used it. It serves a very important purpose for those who are thorough about their lawn. Large aerators are great for open fields, but can't get everywhere on a home lawn."
3,Yard Butler,"the product was as expected, however modification was require to ensure clearing. weld burs blocked on tube.Over all after filing it works as described. basic hand tools required."
3,"Works okay, tends to get clogged a lot for me","Works okay, the metal tubes get clogged easily. Maybe that's par for the course for these things. What's not par for the course is the tubes denting already which can't help the clogging - it bends in on the end.For the money, I don't rate it a great bargain by any means, but if you're having trouble finding an aerator - it does get the job done."
4,Great for what it does,"I bought mine about 5 years ago and it does just what I want it to. It's not for the faint of heart - quite a workout to do even a small lawn, but it goes deep, pulls consistent plugs, and gets a nice aeration done. I rented a power aerator once about 4 years ago, and it was massive over kill for my normal-sized residential lawns. Plus, it broke irrigation in two places that was costly to repair. This tool gives you some ""touch"" when aerating so that if youi hit a sprinkler pipe or something, you'll feel it before you torque down on it, and that's a good thing.DOn't forget to leave the plug cores on the lawn for a couple of weeks and try to break them up before mowing - best fertilizer for your lawn for sure are the plugs after aeration. I recommend the tool."
4,Let's see what happens,"I can see what others are saying about it getting clogged a lot, but once it starts working, it works great. I used it in my backyard about a month or two ago, and it seems that the grass is growing in the bare spots a little more. I just used it now on my front lawn and am hoping for similar results. Overall, the product is a solid piece of metal and quite sturdy."
1,Don't buy this,"The first day I got this it worked great. The next day, under the same conditions, the cores were not ejected. While it still made holes, without ejecting the core, it compacted the soil even more. I cleaned them out and even used WD40 as someone else suggested but that still didn't help. I tried contacting the manufacturer but they didn't not respond to email or phone call. I am returning this junk and purchasing a Step N'Tilt Aerator."
5,G-core model works great,"I went to Lowe's and bought the G-core model at only $20. It works great. The corers are full pieces of cylinders, and seems better built than what I read here about 2 half pieces soldered together. Just aerated my little strip of lawn this afternoon with it."
5,Works better than Zippo,Better designed burner. FLAT catalytic material held close to fuel reservoir. Lights in maybe 5 seconds & STAYS lit until fuel is exhausted. My Zippo will easily go out by itself and the Zippo burners I've used (two) no longer work after just a few days use.
2,Zippo Hand Warmer,"I would purchase this product again and again, however getting the Zippo Hand Warmer to fire up is difficult most of the time. Only major problem. But when it finally starts it is the best thing in the world for your cold hands.."
1,It goes cold when needed most.,I got the handwarmer as a Christmas gift to help keep warm while fly fishing. Unfortunately it works great indoors but as soon as I'm outside it goes cold. I'm sure I've got it filled properly and that it's started. It's very warm before I put it in my pocket. But once I put it outside it just goes cold. As soon as I bring it indoors it starts to heat up again. It's a real bummer because it's a great idea if only it would work.
5,awesome,this thing is awesome. always been curious about these flameless hand warmers so i gave it a shot and was very surprised. really does stay warm for close to 24 hours!works better in a pocket though. get one for each hand so you dont have to keep switching.in other words everything in the item description is 100% accurate....by warm i mean very warm!
1,Not as reliable as expected,"I have had a similar product for 20 years but was lost, and I bought this one to replace it. After about 5 refills it just stopped working.... don't know why.... I'm giving it 1 star because it didn't catch fire."
2,A mediocre product.,"The temperature of this heater varies from toasty warm to barely lukewarm for no apparent reason relating to fuel level or ambient temperature. The catalytic cap fits so precariously on the body I suspect that variation in heat transfer between the cap and body is the reason. The slightest bump will cause the catalytic cap to pop off, regardless of how hard it has been pressed on. All in all this is not a dependable device."
4,GOD MADE ONLY ONE DEX ROMWEBER!,This man plays some AMAZING stuff! He is one-of-a-kind. I have been following him sence 1985 and love everything he does. Dex is Rock N Roll!
1,Dave in Phoenix,"My first listen with Dexter was his ""Lucky Eye"" cd with Flat Duo Jets. I found it amusing and he showed some interesting talent. After reading several rave reviews about ""Chased By Martians"", I purchased it, expecting something similar to Lucky Eye, or maybe better. To my surprise, and this is putting it mildly, it sucked. The production was so bad I immediately sold it to a used record store for 1/3 what I paid for it, which is 3 times more than it was worth to me. Flat Duo Jets smokes compared to this."
1,The WORST picture I have ever seen and took it right back!,"The display is the worst that I have ever seen. You can not adjust the colors to anywhere what they would be normally. There is no black on the display, blue is pretty washed out also. the refresh rate is so low that any movement is blury. so if you want a very poor picture and a blury display then get this one if not get something else you will be much happier. P.S. Dont believe the picture on the box."
3,Depends on what you expect,"I found this on sale for $30, and didn't hesitate to try it out. I've read reviews of it before, and didn't expect much. After playing it for a while, I can't say I'm disappointed.This is one of the largest portable screens out there, but smaller text is still a chore to read. The viewing angle is very limited- luckily the screen can be moved (and color adjusted) to fit the situation. Like other reviewers have said, the very top and bottom of the screen are very hard to see, and there is no real black color- just a very dark green. There is some slight blur during fast movements, but not what I would consider unplayable.The sound is good, and headphone jacks are nice. The screen's design matches the xbox well, and fits without a problem.This screen is more of a novelty for situations when you don't have a TV. If you don't expect much (or pay too much), this screen will fit the bill."
3,This toy sort of sucks,I love this item but it could be better that is why i said it sort of sucks but is really is a cool toy. I just think the graphics could of been better.By: Victoria Torres
3,PLEASE RESPOND,"where in the freaking world can i find a power adapter for my car i need this by fri. so i'd like to be able to find it in a store like best buy or something, where can i find one?"
4,Not right,"i expected this monitor to be able to play in cars. i was wrong. even though it doesn't say it can, it would be thought that it would be car accessible. so, if you are looking for a monitor for family trips in the van, don't waste $180 on this item"
1,misleading advertising,"I bought this screen and contrary to one reviewer, you do have to plug in this screen into a power source, it does not get its power from the xbox; you have a power cord for the screen and the usual power cord for the xbox, both need to be plugged in seperately. Also, the photo shown makes the screen seem much larger than it is, the proportion of the screen to the diameters of the xbox do not correspond in actual size to the way they appear in the photo; the screen is really about 2/3 the size that the photo suggests. It can be hard or next to impossible to read text on the screen and there is no sharpness control. It's not a horrible picture but I'd bet that the new PSP will have a better picture and a screen about the same size. I love my xbox so I'm glad to have this screen to use, it's just too bad there isn't a better one available. Bottom line: this screen is way over priced."
3,[...],"I bought this screen before I took off to Korea then Iraq. Its great to have on hand while you are traveling. However, i just wish the screen was a bit bigger.If you want to take mine off my hands. [...]"
2,Not as expected...off white,I have used Canon paper and got this for price. It is not bright white and therefore loses out on the best glossy picture.My estimate is that this is 88 whereas canon is 105.
5,"Love It, Love It, Love It!!!!",Definitely a must have CD for anyone who remembers & loves the music from the 70's.
2,He has GOT to be kidding!,"First, I agree that ""Europeans spend more time with their mistresses"" to be a ridiculous pseudo-fact. I disagree with the reader who said there was no point of view in this book. It leaned so far to the left it fell off my bookshelf! Finally, Luttwak's claim that the organized crime movement is the key to Russia's salvation, as the yakuza saved Japan and the mafia saved Italy, was just too laughable for words. On the plus side, I do agree with Luttwak that this ""turbo-charged capitalism"" has led to an increase in the gap between the rich and poor. Luttwak is correct to fear that this trend will only continue in the immediate future."
2,Nostalgia,I only got this cd because I love Malcolm in the middle and I wanted to own some other stuff from the show. But the cd is bad. I only got it for nostalgic purposes.
5,Malcolm Rules Baby!,"I'm a HUGE fan of the show, so it was only natural for me to buy the sound track. Let me tell ya...this sound track rocks! The theme song's kickin' and the mix by the Dust Brothers is cool, too! If you haven'y bought the sound track yet...GO BUY IT FOR CHISSAKE!"
5,MALCOLM LOVERS!!!!,THIS IS THE BEST CD IT has all the music even the theme song life is unrfair THAT MY FREIND IS THE COOLEST SONG AROUND so buy it and see 4 ur self
5,Metal Mania,"This is a great Heavy metal CD. I was glad to find it again because I burned out my cassette tape years ago. Solid metal similar to the Y&T and Dokken style. Makes me want to walk around with my bandana around my neck sporting my old ""Maiden"" shirt"
5,a true metal album feast,"i can't say enough about this album. back in 85 a friend gave me this album on cassette. i was blown away, great metal songs from front to finish. i couldn't believe they didn't blow up big back then, no radio play, vids, nothing. i still don't even know the names of the musicians that recorded this but they were tight as hell and the songs were true hard driving metal masterpieces. i hear their second album was bad ass too, i've got to check it.all the tracks are great but my fave is still ""World War."" I feel this album is America's answer to the Leps ""High N Dry.""if you want true 80's metal not mixed with glam, not mixed with alternative, rap, punk, etc...this album's for you."
4,Much better then I thought it would be.,They lost a drummer and the lead singer. I thought this CD would stink. I was wrong. Much better then their second and almost as good as their first. Not a bad song on the disk. In fact the more I hear it the more I like it. If you like power metal you will like this cd.
3,MK II,"As long as you dont compare this album to the two prior Jorn-sung cds, this i quite nice.. The debut ws better but this totally competes for second place! Vocals and riffing is nice. Song-writing could be better."
2,You'll have this stuff laying around your house!,"Please before you buy this toy note what your actually buying. Included in the box is..A very flimsy what looks like a paint tray for a roller. Unpainted plastic houses, an empty water bottle, sticks, paint brush, a squeegee, a quick dry paints 6 colors. Along with a 38 page book about Tsunamis. 3 pages on instruction.My children enjoyed painting the houses, and I used the squeegee for the shower. The tray would collapse if you put water in it.I paid 7.14 for a squeegee and about an hours worth of quiet fun for 3 of my kids.I guess I will give it two stars rather then one for that reason. :-)"
5,THE NEVER ENDING SONG OF LOVE HAS NOT LOST ITS BRILLIANCE.,ITS A SHAME THAT AMAZON HAS CHOSEN NOT TO PROVIDE A LISTENING OPTION FOR THE NEVER ENDING SONG OF LOVE. THIS IS THE ONE SONG THAT MAY OUT LIVE US ALL. OUR GREAT GREAT GRANDCHILDREN WILL LISTEN TO IT AT THEIR WEDDINGS AND ANNIVERSERIES. THIS SONG IS THE ONE REASON TO BUY THIS ALBUM.
3,Glad I bought it but...,"This is one of those recordings that you are glad you own for it's historical significance (it represents the goodtime party era of the early/mid seventies to me) but you'll find that you don't actually play it very often. It seems well...like a bachelor uncle who is always trying to prove how hip he is. It just doesn't work anymore.Best played during lonely, nostalgic, late-night drunks.Much better sound quality than Delaney and Bonnie's Live on Tour with Eric Clapton. Buy just one, this one."
4,The Brest of Delaney & Bonnie,Most of the songs are very good some of the songs sound to similar to other songs on the album.
4,ONLY YOU KNOW AND I KNOW,"Released in 9/71, this is an edited (crime) version of 3:24, the original is 4:10 on the 1972 vinyl ""The Best Of Delaney And Bonnie"". The full length original version, with Clapton & Mason, does not seem to be available on cd, unless it is available under Dave Mason or Eric Clapton."
5,Delaney and Bonnie,"My father has been looking for an album, tape and CD for many, many years. This was a fluke that I came across this and you certainly made my Dad happy!"
3,Ms. Pacman/Galaga,"I agree with 1 review that states the joystick has ""issues"". After one day of heavy use, the joystick did not turn when needed nor where it was needed to go in Ms. Pacman, making it frustrating for me when I used to ""own"" the high score at the arcade many years ago! However, Galaga was a blast to do again and while it is not as responsive as I'd like it to be, it was still a good time and I could still impress even with the relatively cheaply constructed controls. After all, it is a kids game and I'm used to banging away at a commercial machine. All in all, it is a great value for kids to help hand/eye coordination with multiple games for several age ranges. I got it for my nieces/nephews and they loved it! My sister and I really enjoyed it as well-takes us WAY back-thank you!"
4,Just as expected,"We are having a blast playing the retro games! I bought it primarily for Galaga and have not been disappointed - it's a little tougher to maneuver because you have to hold the joystick, but not a deal breaker. Ms. Pac-Man is a bit touchy, but a lot of fun, too!"
3,4 out of 5 ain't bad (if that 1 wasn't Ms. PacMan),This thing is a lot of fun but if you're buying it solely for Ms. PacMan you will be bitterly disappointed. The first one I bought was defective and you couldn't move Ms. PacMan vertically at all. The replacement was better but moving her vertically is still very eratic. Completely unacceptable in that sort of game.The remaining games seem to work just fine and are a blast to play.
4,"Maybe I got a Revision 2, because controller is A+","I read the reviews from previous reviewers, but asked my GF to buy me this anyway.The controller works perfect! Mrs. Pacman, Pole Position, everything works great.I was most surprised and impressed at how true to the classics the games really are!!! They even have the demo modes if you don't touch the controller. The Sound Effects are just like the original games, as best as I can remember.The graphics quality is as perfect as the original coin opperated arcade games. This is no Atari home system. This is just like the stand up arcade machines I used to play at ""Pizza Hut"" back in the early '80s.Either I got lucky and got a properly made unit, or they redesigned and improved the joystick by the time mine was purchased on 11/26/04. This thing is well worth the money. I am impressed for the price paid ($20.00).Thanks,Rem"
3,Not bad,"A friend got this for his birthday, and everyone had a good time playing it. The one problem was...you got it, the joystick was terrible. It was very, very hard to turn the corners on Ms. Pac Man. That made the game unplayable. But when we bought ours, the joystick worked just fine.Galaga didn't suffer from the needs of a joystick as Ms. PacMan, and that was very well done, so Galaga was enjoyable, as was Mappy - a game I had forgotten about.I didn't like Pole Position when it was out, and I don't like it now, so I can't comment on how good that game was."
2,Not as fun as the originals....,"First, let me say the $119.99 price tag on this item is TOTALLY outrageous and unbelievable. I purchased this same item about a year ago for $19.99. You can still find it for $19.99 in stores. I'm hoping Amazon's price is a typo.As for the unit itself, it's very awkward and hard to use. Also, unless I just don't remember correctly, the games are not of the same quality as they were way back when. Additionally, more times than not, the games ""freeze"", causing you to have to start from scratch.I downloaded some of these old games to my cellphone, and sadly, the quality is much better."
2,Stiff joystick makes it impossible to control...,"I was a Ms. Pac-Man fan growing up...spent hours at the arcade playing this game as a kid. So as you can imagine, I was thrilled when the repro was put on the market.I ran home, inserted my batteries and plugged it into my TV. Voila! I couldn't wait to play.Unfortunately, the stiff joystick made it difficult to maneuver. At times I had no control over where Ms. Pac Man was going. I'd move her left and she'd run right into a ghost. It was more frustrating than anything.I gave it 2 stars for nostalgia's sake and the cost. But even at $20, it's not worth the aggravation. Save your money."
4,Old-School Arcade right in your hands!,"I started playing an arcade machine in my locaql movie theater's arcade, It was The Mrs. Pacman/Galaga machine.I really like playing it, I also saw one in my local arcade machine dealer's window, i really wanted one, but they cost around $3,000.I went over to my friends house and saw that he had a spongebob plug n' play Tv game system, then i looked at the box for it, and I sa the Mrs. Pacman TV game system!! I immediatley got some of my money and got my parents to go to Walmart and I picked one up. I love it!!! You can play Till youre eyes give out!!! I don't have to keep on putting 50 cents in!!! I also like some of the other games on it. The best thing about it is that you don't need to buy more games or controllers!!!! All you need is a TV(and maybe a comfy couch).The only downside is that it erses the High scores when you turn it off.All in All, i think it's great if you don't have enough to buy a real $3,000 machine, this is the next best thing!!!!!"
4,Good if you want to play Galaga and Mappy,I am a star at Galaga but some tv machines can't do plug & play.All three tvs we had wouldn't do it which stunk because I had towait 7 days finally after Christmas 2004 we got a old tv and itworked. The batteries wore low twice so far. Don't play Ms pacmanMs PAC-MAN is hard on this very machine.Ms pac-man's rating is 4/5 don't play this game because its slowI can only get 2 levels past the first intermission.Galaga's rating is 5/5 because I can get in the highscore list easily. Buy it!
3,Ms Pacman Disappointing but other games are fine,"As everyone has stated the joystick sucks on Ms Pacman and I have also encountered some ""glitches"" such as leaving the maze altogther. This is very disappointing and the system would totally suck if it wasn't so much damn fun playing Galaga, Pole Position, Xavius, and even Mappy a little. It's very unfortunate because I have the Pacman and Atari game consoles and they work pefect. I am a HUGE Ms Pacman fan and I am very disappointed with the game."
1,Faulty Game Controllers,"I received the Namco II: Ms Pac-Man with 5 TV Games and the Pac-Man with 5 TV Games. I love playing Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, but the controllers are too hard to operate. You have to push and pull too hard on the stick. With the old Atari joystick, I could at least get to the banana, and the movement of the stick was easy, easy, easy. That is not the case with the new longer stick. Also, the boxes are square, which make it hard to hold.I love the concept of the TV version. This is a great idea, but the joy sticks are terrible. Every time I try to play, I get frustrated; my hands hurt from holding the stick and box. Maneuverability is terrible, terrible, terrible.Just in case you think that maybe this is an isolated case,my daughter works at a large retail store. She said people were returning them for the reasons I have stated."
1,Ruined our big screen TV!!!!,"Our title tells it all, didn't expect much for $15, but certainly didn't expect our big screen tv to blow once we plugged this puppy in. My advice to you would be plug it into a cheapy tv!"
2,I was so excited and then sooo dissapointed,"I wish I read the reviews before I bought this game. The joystick commands just don't work properly.Galaga was the only game that I could barely play. Pole position was defective and so was Xevious on the unit I purchased. With all the complaints I just read on this product I'm surprised they haven't taken it off the shelves. Like others have said, you can't play Ms. Pac-man because you have absolutely no control over the joystick. It's too bad; I was really looking forward to beat my old records."
1,Selling this thing should be a crime!,"Everyone else has already hit the highlights...the joystick doesn't control the Ms. Pacman, the fire button is on the left instead of right, the game doesn't retain the high scores. If I didn't think some kids might read this, I'd be tempted to use some expletives!! That's how disappointed I was in this thing."
2,Call Jakks weekly in hopes they will fix joystick problems,"I agree with everyone who complains about the joystick problems with Ms. Pac Man. It definately does not work like the original. I suggest we all call them every week (or more often if you like) and ask if they are fixing it. Sooner or later, they will have to fix it. The toll free number is 1-877-875-2557."
3,Great idea ruined by bad joystick? Maybe...,"Most of the reviews here mention problems with the joystick on this. I've only played for an hour or so and haven't noticed a problem yet -- though (as many have mentioned) it does seem particularly quirky on Ms. PacMan.It's too bad, because the software and gameplay seem EXACTLY like I remember them (though I haven't found the Xevious Easter eggs I recall). I hope the joystick holds out because I'm looking forward to blowing lots of evenings blasting down memory lane.I hate when good ideas are ruined by cheap/shoddy implementation. As of this moment, I can neither confirm nor deny, but anyone considering buying this should mentally prepare themselves for that rather strong likelihood."
2,Namco Ms. Pac Man,"The game I received from amazon.com, the joy stick DOES NOT work right. You can't always go the direction you want to go. You give it input to move, but the game decides which way it wants to go. Makes playing the game very difficult. I hope this is just a fluke of this game, and not other ms. pac man games."
4,An arcade in your home for under $20!,"I personally am a Pac-Man freak...Ms. Pac-Man is just as good. Now, instead of spending dozens of quarters at the arcade, I can have this neat game at home! It's super easy to use, just plug it in and set your TV to the right Line. For the cost, it's all you'd expect. I personally only play it for Ms. Pac-Man, but it has 4 other games too! I only gave it 4 stars tho cuz it saves high scores, but not like individual highs. It's one high score, not a whole high score board, so there's no way of knowing who acheieved that score...but otherwise, this is a great video game! Definately worth the buy."
2,Not the best,I really love Galaga it like your playing the real thing. However Ms Pacman suck the controller was not made for this game you try to move one way and it get stuck for the most part the other games are ok. I just wish the controller was made a little better.
4,ok game,"I think my mom likes this more than I do. Ms.Pac-Man is ok, but it is really hard to steer. Galaga is great no flaws at all! Mappy is great as well. Pole position took me forever to figure out how to steer, but all you have to do is twist the joy stick. Xevou is another flawless game. the only con is: the joy stick sometimes messes up."
2,"Flawed Ms. Pac Man, Rest OK","As with other reviewers, I hate how the joystick works with Ms. Pac Man. It's terrible, I can't believe they even released the game like this. The previous model with Pac Man was fine.The other games work OK, but the marquis game on the joystick isn't playable as-is."
1,Don't waste your money,"It was a very unpleasant and frustating experience. This game would be great except the joystick doesn't work well at all. If the joystick would have worked, I would have given this a rave review. Don't waste your money."
1,"Not defective unit, defective programmers","This is my second one, the first one I returned because I believed it was defective. Unfortunately the second one has the same problems and now that additional reviews are posted it looks like I'm not the only one. Joystick does not work for Ms Pac Man or Pole Position and the color is terrible. Sigh. I really wanted this to. Well off it goes back to the company. I wonder how many units will return to manifacturer? 100%?"
3,Ms. Pac Man joystick does not work...,"I bought this game for my boyfriend because he LOVES Ms. Pac Man and it was the ""star"" game on this system, however, it is the only game that doesn't work. The joystick works fine for the 4 other games, but on Ms. Pac Man it won't go up or down. A HUGE disappointment, too good to be true. I am very disappointed and will be returning the game system."
1,The Joystick Stinks,"I bought this game with high hopes as I am an avid Ms. Pac Man fan who longed to play the original arcade game at home without having to spend $2500 on a real freestanding arcade game.This game was a real disappointment. The joystick is very unresponsive. It has a hard time moving up and down....really it has a mind of its own.Also, after eating a power pill the ghosts don't move back toward Ms. Pac-Man as they did in the original arcade version.Lastly, there is no 2 player capability.The Pole Position game was pretty decent, the other games were pretty boring.I think I am going to send this game back."
1,Disappointing,"There have been some improvements on this version. The base of the game is easier to hold. Also, there button to pause a game. However, the joystick is difficult to use and the picture is far inferior to previous versions. With a faulty joystick and a blurry picture these ""improvements"" are of little value."
2,Faulty Joystick - Widespread Issue,"This game should be immediately recalled, as the joystick does not work in Ms. Pacman. The joystick is unresponsive in the up and down directions.I thought I had a bad device and called the manufacturer, but after reading the latest reviews it is clear they have a problem on their hands.The first device had a better joystick but the physical design was so bad that it hurt to play. Now this device has a better design but the actual joystick is not working properly.Makes me wonder if this company does any testing at all.The other games seem to work fine but Ms. pacman is what you want."
4,Namco II,I say Ms Pac-Man isn't a game you will like because it is hard tomove her up and down instead she will turn sometimes into dangerzones that's the only problem. If you like Galaga though you will need batteries because you will play that game alot. I ratedthe game 5 because I play Galaga alot now and I am getting goodat it.
4,A Blast from the Past!,"How excited was I when I saw the possibility of playing Ms. PacMan again after so many years!? I actually bought it for my daughter's birthday (8 yrs. old), but I think I use it more! Ms. PacMan: Takes some getting used to the joystick. I kept going the wrong way for a while but now I've got the hang of it. I've even been learning the new ghost patterns so I know where to go to eat them all up after eating the pill. This version is harder than the arcade version. I have yet to finish the 3rd (orange level). But I like the challenge. My daughter absolutely loves Galaga. And I must say, I actually reached 81,000 the other day. Mappy is another cute game. Xevious is fine too. And Pole Position.. well, I still really haven't mastered it yet. But as long as I don't drive like that in real life! All in all, I LOVE this product.. and you can't beat the hours of endless play for the money!"
4,Buy it for Xevious,"Ms Pac-Man was the reason to purchase this unit, however as in most reviews, she is hard to control with the joystick. However, Xevious is exceedingly challenging to those of us not as adept at video games, and here the joystick is flawless. This game is highly addictive and responds to your success by throwing more alien fire at you. As a result of this fast-paced game, the large fire button will have a short life span as the small spring in the inner switch will break with repeated use. Those who are mechanically / electrically inclined can fix this and actually make the game a bit easier to score higher. As with most who discover a game they haven't played, the instructions are pretty bare - trial & error, and the Web!!"
3,Ms. Pac Man fanatic disappointed,Don't buy if you are buying for Ms. PacMan. I can't even get past the second level due to the joy stick's poor responsiveness. Keep the packaging and return it.
4,Fun at Heart,"First off: Don't try holding this. I have better results sitting it down. It won't slide around and lets you move the stick like an arcade machine.Galaga is the best port on here. My only complaint is that it's harder to rapid fire/RF can't be turned on.Mappy can be confusing, but it's fun.Xevious is tough, but also fun.Pole Posistion can be challenging to get the hang of, but it's one of the best arcade racers from the earlier days of gaming.MPM is fine by itself. True that the ghosts don't follow you, but this is off of the original version. The arcade boards of that time couldn't handle that much AI.Just like their original version, these games would take time to build up skill. But you'd stick around, because you'd be addicted. This is the closest you'll get to buying an arcade machine."
4,Great for the price,"This game is really cool BUT I too have experienced a few problems with Ms. Pac Man. It seems that sometimes Ms. Pac Man mysteriously goes through the ghosts or vice versa. (which is a good thing- because I do not die) The joystick is a little finicky at times so I have to push harder to get her to move in the direction I want her to go. All the other games do work good and because I am so fond of Ms. Pac Man, it is okay that she is not perfect! HA! A must get."
2,Malfunctioning Mess,"We had the same problems everyone else mentioned here (confusing pole position controls, inability to control ms. pacman, etc. ). However, we had an additional problem that no one else seems to have mentioned (and it could not just have been a fluke as we bought and returned 2 separate units and experienced the same problem for both).On Galaga, our fighter gets captured, and an additional fighter does not appear; the game is basically in a holding pattern and you have to restart. Has this happened to anyone else?Also, on Ms. Pacman, the sound gets screwy and you jump from the first level to like the fifth level for some reason sometimes. Is it just us???"
5,We love it!!!,We love all the games except Mappy. I can't get my husband away from the game so I can have a turn. We haven't had any problems with the joy stick. We're going to buy more to give away as gifts.
1,It didn't work - froze on various games,"Funky behavior on all the games. On Galaga when you're freeing your ship after it has been captured, the freed ship just spins in mid-air...forever. Other games just froze. It may be just this one console is bad, but I sent it back for a refund."
2,"Like everyone else, Disapointed with Ms Pac Man","Yes, the joystick stinks on Ms Pac Man. I also went through the passage to the other side of the screen and the ghosts turned blue, and a power pellet disappeared from the screen, although i was nowhere near it. Galaga works well, as well as Zevious, and Mappy. I love the steering on Pole Position. The first time I played, I went off the course and could not get back on. I thought it was broken, until i read the directions and it said to use the yellow ball at the top of the joystick to steer. Great, idea, the handling on that car is awesome now!"
2,Ms Pacman's the only good game on this console Unlike Pacman,"I really Mrs pacman better than Pacman, but Ms. Pacman wasn't out yet when we got Pacman, but we love all the games on it. Don't leave it on or the batteries will die. We now have the Mrs Pac also, but that is the only game we like on that console."
1,"DO NOT BUY!!! GAME IS GREAT, JOYSTICK IS HORRIBLE","I bought this thinking what a great idea, I love this game. On a scale of 1-10, playing Ms. Pac Man is a 9. The re-creation is great (somewhat slower than arcade, but great). however, the quality of the joystick is so horrendous (about a 2 on scale of 1-10 on best day when brand new) it will drive you to insanity. I am sure they sacrificed build quality to make this product $20. Let me assure you I would easily pay double for a joystick that was even decent. To bad a great idea was destroyed by such low quality. Now if you are getting the game for Galaga or Pole Position, the joystick is not so much an issue. Only true problem for Ms Pac Man. Hope this info saves you from throwing your money away!"
4,Great but could be improved,"Every game control's are fine except for Ms. Pacman, sometimes it is hard to get her to do what you want. When playing pole position you need to turn the joystick left and right, that is the steering wheel. Well worth the money though."
1,What a piece of junk - do not buy!!!!,"Do NOT buy this game! My husband bought it for my son yesterday and when we unplugged it, the audio input plug broke off and is now stuck in the TV and we have to call a professional to come and get it out."
1,Sounds to good to be true because it is. . .,"Our family is technically savvy, but we couldn't get the unit to work at all. We figured there was a problem with the first one we bought, so we took a gamble and got another, which also doesn't work. We shouldn't have been surprised, since the instructions direct you to a long list of tv manufacturers and their customer service lines (asking that you call your tv manufacturer first to trouble-shoot). . .Namco must have anticipated the angry callers. Don't waste your money."
4,Super Fun,I've read many comments about this game.But I LOVE it.I got this for my birthday and I have no problem with it. Maybe sometimes Ms.PacMan would go the opposite direction I wanted her to go. But overall I LOVE IT!
1,Joystick doesn't work well,Games are great but... with cheap joystick its soooo frustrating to play. couldn't go up down on miss-pac-man. what a waste... returned it sameday
2,Very disapointing..... but still fun.,"The first thing we noticed after firing up our first game of ms. pac man was the faulty joystick. After some sighs and practicing I've somewhat figured out how to get the best out of the directional control -- but 1/2 the time it still seems to have a mind of it's own.Besides the faulty joystick, the game has some other issues. One time I actually went right through a ghost, another time I went though the tunnel and when I came out the other side I was outside of the maze -- STUCK! My game was over at that point. The programming needs some refinement.For all of my gripes about the disappointments we still play the game a lot. I just wish they would have done some research while designing this game."
3,Joystick Sux,The joystick is hard to control. Takes a long time to get use to it. The direction on the joystick are not definite. Fun yet hard to adapt to.
3,"Fun Games of old, New controller of Bad","The games are awesome! You got Ms. Pacman, Pole Position, Galaga, and more! How could you go wrong, right? Well, you could start off by having the only way to control Pole Position be the rotation of the controller. I like Pole Position, but this method was too frustrating to make me go on with it. I really like Ms. Pacman, so i guess it was worth the $17 or so I paid for it at Costco. Have fun!"
3,Controller works well for 3 of 5 games,"I bought this after reading the previous reviews, knowing that it may not work very well, and as I thought, it didn't work for every game. Pole Position basically didn't work at all, you can't steer, which is kind of important when you are driving a racecar. Ms. Pac Man is difficult to manuever around properly, I would suggest getting the old Super Nintendo version if you crave something that is close to the original. However I do still give this device 3 stars because it works fine with Galaga, which is what I bought it for. Galaga is exactly like the arcade version. Also as an added bonus, the other two games, Xevious and Mappy are pretty fun, too. If you love Galaga and have the 20 bucks I would still recommend this."
2,Little explination,"I picked this book after reading lots of reviews. I wanted a book that covered game physics and could help me reconnect to the math I was using on the job. But this book, while covering every topic I was interested in does a very poor job of explaining what is going on. The author often throws out a complex equation with no explanation of the terms and transforms the equation into a seemingly different variation with all new terms and zero effort to tie them together. The code is too agnostic, and not useful for reading or using. I am back at amazon looking for a better book, this one is to simple for someone versed in the math and lacks the explanations needed to help someone get back up to speed on the subjects. If you had never had a college physics course or taken calculus you would not be able to get anything out of this book at all."
5,Literally everything you need,"I wanted to write a review to applaud this book and it's author. Of all of the running and fitness books I have experienced, this book is the one of the only books to achieve putting the entire picture together. It not only gives you the accurate and entire picture, Art Liberman does it in a way that is easy to read and follow. He is one of the only authors to communicate worth-while information in a manner that will keep you reading the book. I attribute its ease of reading and thouroughness to my success as a ""budding"" runner. This is a keeper."
5,Seals & Crofts - One of the Best Bands of the 60s and 70s,"Sudan Village is one of my favorite albums. It has a wonderful feel to it and the title track never fails to blow me away. This album brings back a lot of memories and covers many important tracks.This wonderful album allows you to remember their live shows, which were always great fun. Although these are some of their lesser known tracks, it is a great album to own!"
3,good option for crappy Yamaha VX stock,"If I could rate them, the factory Yamaha VX WaveRunner mirrors would get half a star. I've used these as a replacement. They bolt in to the top hole with no modification, but still leave the bottom hole from the factory mirrors exposed. These have some give to them, in case you rub up against a dock. So far, they haven't broken off yet. They're also slightly larger and more convex, so you can see behind you better when towing. They're also adjustable, unlike the stock mirrors. They don't exactly fit with the stock cover for the WaveRunner, and stuffing them into the pockets makes me nervous about breaking something. I'd recommend these to anyone over the stock VX mirrors, but it would be great if the manufacturer took this good idea and customized it specifically to address the problems with Yamaha's VX WaveRunner's mirrors."
4,"CIPA 11161 PWC Safety 3.5"" x 6.25"" Mirror Sport II (White)","CIPA 11161 PWC Safety 3.5"" x 6.25"" Mirror Sport II (White) was just fine, some what high priced but certainly a real heck of a deal better than was was in the marine store."
3,"Authentic yes, good for yoga no","While this CD is enjoyable for the simple authentic flavor and richness of the individual tracks, I was unable to enjoy this with a yoga practice, and chose to change CD's in the middle of my class. There is no flow from one track to another, the tracks were arranged in a disjointed fashion where there would be a slow track then a fast track, then maybe another slow track again. Very difficult to build a rhythm or tempo for a class or private yoga setting."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"As Promethea continues, along with exploring a mythic female superhero archetype with a long line of predecessors like the Phantom, but magical, Moore delves into his own mystical interests through dialogues and the Tarot. If you are looking for a straight superhero story, this will definitely disappoint, if you don't like Hellblazer, or Swamp Thing, or Sandman, or other such mysticism, it is very very unlikely that you will enjoy Promethea, other than for the artwork."
3,Alan Moore on a chair explaining random things. Thats it.,"Have you seen an episode in a TV series that is just a bridge for things to happen from one story to another? I felt volume 3 something like that. Nothing really goes on except talking heads explaining the bizarre things in the page, you realize it after the second chapter/issue and then you flip the pages and think: oh crap I wasted my money.It's not bad per se and that's why I give it 3 stars and not zero or one, but it's just a bit boring after a while. It is incredibly forgettable, sort of the volume to complete the whole story.If you plan to buy it I would suggest to maybe buy it with volume 4 (I haven't read it yet) or leave it at last, because here nothing really exciting happens."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Promethea bad girl, ends world. Or does she? Her, and a backup, anyway, while she goes off on a mystical symbol-quest. This is pretty trippy stuff, and again, is not anywhere near the Hulk smash, Batman scare dodgy street crim school of superhero storytelling. So if you want straight action, rather than magic and mysticism loopiness, stay away."
4,Wonder Filled,I liked this book's exploration of metaphysics and spirituallity. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is the open ending.I hope the next one comes out soon.
3,Teen pop,"As a kid I loved David Cassidy in the days before I discovered Leonard Cohen. Of course I also thought The Partridge Family were a hot band. I think that of these songs, Rock Me Baby, Go Now and How Can I Be Sure were all hits.But I much prefer Soft As A Summer Shower, a truly beautiful atmospheric love song with great imagery. David had some catchy songs but over a whole album's length, his music is not that engaging.I think The Partridge Family albums are a bit better as their catchy songs had more of a pop sensibility than David's often cumbersome ballads. I'm giving the album 3 stars for old time's sake."
5,"Thank you, David!!!","I'm so glad David Cassidy finally listened to his fans and allowed this album to be released on CD. David's talent is evident throughout and grabs you from the first song to the last. Don't miss this one. You won't regret buying it. The best of the album? How about ""Rock Me Baby"", ""Some Kind Of A Summer"", ""How Can I Be Sure"", ""Song For A Rainy Day"" and ""Soft As A Summer Shower."" My CD collection has had a huge hole in it without ""Rock Me Baby."" Now let's hope ""Dreams Are Nuthin' More Than Wishes"" is next. And then... Well, you know what I mean!"
1,I never could get it to work.,"I'm no computer technician so it could very well be me, but I never could get this thing to work."
1,Outdoor Extension Cleaning system,"Handle way to flimsy after one summer of use. Brushes and attachments are fine, but handle's plastic connection to hose has broken. Not worth it."
4,the singing and the writing,"I am extremely fussy about singer-songwriters (male and female), but I like Rose Polenzani's style. She can be dramatic without being melodramatic. She can be funny without being dopey. Her lyrics and music are sad without being whiny. She can also rock out pretty convincingly (""Polliwog's Lament"").I guess that I am removing a star (reluctantly) because at times her impressionistic lyrics seem to veer toward expressionismistic (i.e., only apparently meaningful), but hey sometimes words just sound good together (thinking of the llama song here, which begins with some nice harmonics).Definitely go see her perform. Her inter-song monologues ramble enough to be fun without being self-indulgent. It makes you believe that she's got a lot on her mind that she'd like to share ... but not right now. Wait for the song."
5,Great Remote,"I bought this remote as a replacement for an old TV I had in my basement. I needed a basic remote that would be able to turn the TV on, change the channels, and change the volume. For the price, you definitely get your moneys worth out of this universal remote.I like that the remote is smaller than your average TV remote control. Not too small that I would lose it, but not too big with a bunch of useless buttons. The plastic casing seems durable enough for when (oh and I have) I drop it on my hard floor.I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a basic universal remote."
4,Remote,It got to my home a lot sooner than I thought it would and it works well and I love the price.
2,Not the best,"The remote was easy to set up, but both the sleep button and the input button don't work on mine. If I had to do it again, I would pay the extra 5 bucks for a fully functioning remote."
3,Universal remote,"It works well, but still trying to get the menu option to work with the television. Overall, it was a good buy."
2,"It works, for the most part.","The remote was easy to sync up with my tv and dvd, but lacks the buttons for the dvd player. Like the menu button, for example. So once I get the dvd playing, this remote can pause, jump ahead or back and control the volume. All-in-all, it really didn't replace the dvd remote at all. I would not recommend this to a friend."
3,Okay replacement,It really needs a menue feature or guide to replace mmy other remote. Cant see what options are before changing channels
2,"Worked, but lost its programming several times.","Fairly easy to program, but for some reason it forgot it after a few weeks. Batteries were still good so not sure why that kept happening. I finally tossed it in the trash."
3,Don't work with my DVD player,"This is a really good remote for my Panasonic TV and Sony VCR, but it won't work with my GE DVD player. I have a 6-device RCA Universal Remote, and it don't work either.My TV have 3 modes: radio, video, and TV. I have to use my TV remote to put the TV on video mode to watch DVDs. This remote doesn't have a botton to do that.I lost the VCR remote and that was the whole reason for buying this one. It does serve that purpose, quite well."
4,Just as advertised and works well.,"This remote was applied to a 32"" LCD where the original remote simply quit working. I can't comment on how it works for various or odd brands of televisions and peripheral devices since the TV in the bedroom where this is used is an RCA as well. It works great with my RCA TV! If there was any drawback with it I would say the fact that it's not back-lit is a bit of an inconvenience but overall good value considering the functionality and what I paid."
3,RCA RCU403 3 Remote Control,"I have three RCA remote controls. One was given to me, the others I purchased.The first two were easy to program. The third is the problem. It accepted the codes for my U-Verse reciever, but will not accept codes for APEX TV. I have tried every which way to program it, to no avail. I do recommend this control to whomever buys it."
3,"Hitachi codes don't work for TV, only power and menu for Dish receiver","Got this remote because it was cheap. My in-laws remote for their Dish receiver and Hitachi TV went bad. I was worried that this wouldn't work with the Dish, but the codes for Hitachi TVs didn't work with their TV. The Dish code worked only for power and menu. It couldn't change channels and you can't get the guide. I didn't expect to get the guide(no dedicated guide button), but I wanted to at least change channels. Tried their auto and manual setup for the codes and both didn't work for the TV. I'm still debating whether I should manually enter 200+ codes to see if any one of them would work with the TV or just return it.The good...It's small and can control three devices(so long as they work). It's working for other reviewers so just depending on your equipment ymmv. Make sure you can return it, just in case the codes don't work for you."
4,TV Remotes,"Remotes were a great buy, however I feel the shipping and handling charges were a little excessive. I am in shipping and it did not cost what they charged to ship the items."
1,Doesn't Work Don't Waste Your Money,"I tried to program my TV with it and it didn't do anything. None of the codes work and when I test on my VCR to see if it worked at all the only thing it would for the VCR is turn it off and on. I thought I would be able to have my TV programmed with no problems, but I was wrong"
4,Does the job,"I am very happy with it. It does the job, and can't beat it for the price. I would definitely buy it again."
4,Nice and Simple Remote,"Good remote for what you pay! The only problem I've had with it is that you have to be very precise with the angle in which you hold the remote, or it just doesn't work. But that's an easy fix. Also, it works from far distances. I'd recommend it to people who want an easy, basic remote!"
1,Will not work with my tv!,"I ordered this and it said it would work with my brand tv however, I tried to program it and it does not work! I would not recommend this to others!"
3,Works,"I needed a remote for my RCA B27TF685 27"" TV/VCR/DVD Triple Combo. The remote works with the TV but I haven't been able to get it to operate the VHS and DVD separately. When I turned the TV on with the remote it was registering the VHS and I had to manually turn the DVD on and then the remote would play/pause/ff etc. Just got it yesterday so I may need to play with it a bit more. Not sure if I should have gotten the 4-device instead. If anyone has any feedback on a better remote option I'd appreciate your comments. Thanks!"
1,not the remote needed!!!,"this remote did not have the ""button"" on it that it showed in the original picture....we were looking for onethat has a selection to change antenna input selection. This one does not have that, therefore it is notuseful to us at all."
5,The Item was ok,The item met my needs. It is simple to program and use. I would had liked more feature but it gets the job done.
2,Refurbished or used,"I bought this remote when the channel button stopped working on my tv and I lost the origional remote. I wanted a cheap, easy to use remote. All it had to do was change the channel on my tv from 2 to 3. Well, it worked. The channel up & down button on the remote doesnt work though. It's obviously refurbished or just plain used. There are scratches all over it and the front face was obviously cleaned with some sort of solvent as it left an easy noticable smear through all the painted numbers.BUYER BEWARE. though it may work, I wouldn't have purchased it if I knew it was a refurb."
3,its ok not all that,"listen it does its jobThis universal remote control works perfect, the way you input the code for your tv or device is very very simple and that is great.If you wrongly press another button like VCR you just press TV and it works again, what I mean is that it does not get misconfigured like others universal controls that I have had in the past. so baisically no qualms"
4,Like the glow feature,The glow feature is nice. The remote still works just fine. I bought this in September of 06'.
1,Poor Quality,This remote did not do what it said that it would. I am disappointed in this product for what I had planned it for.
3,great buy!,I bought this to replace one that broke...it works great but i too felt that the shipping was a little bit pricy....you might be better off buying a remote in walmart or some place like that....so as to not pay more than what the price of the remote is in shipping.
1,inability to perform needed tasks.,The only thing this does is turn the tv on or off. I tried to change the input but the enter button was ignored. No other capability.
1,My remote,I am unable to write a review on this item as I bought it for another person.It should be a okay.
5,awesome!,"awesome watch, very unique and beautiful, one of the few more feminine watches made by diesel. great price too!"
1,Communism,This Michael Albert is a Communist. Period! The problem with his logic is there is no logic. A system which destroys the incentive to go beyond others and excel is a system of medieval lunacy. The world economies over the last 250 years are based on men and women pursuing their dreams. Socialism takes this away from people who want more in life. To place everyone under State Rule would be disastrous for all on earth.Again these left wing people can't see beyond their front yard.They fail to see the consequences of their actions.They are simply communist and thieves who want to take away from you and me and give to the state to be distributed equally. Now tell me why work hard if their is no reward. These people should scare everyone.
5,Dynastic,"Been waiting to see this series again for a long.time. ""Please release all of them"" and The Colby'sPLEASE !!!!"
5,Real Good Fun.,"I bought this dvd out of curiosity as i was born just after Dynasty ended and never watched reruns, so i didnt know how this would be.I really enjoyed watching it and loved the OVER-THE-TOP cliffhangers that made you wanna watch the next episode right away. Season 1 is pretty fun especially the last 3 episodes,i found the best. Season 2 is good as well with more over the top fun and the introduction of Alexis.I ordered these together with Dallas for the same reason.I watched Dynasty first and started watching the first episode of Dallas but it just didnt appeal to me, i like Dynasty much much better because, just like i've read in a forum, Dynasty knew that it was over the top so people were never outraged if something was just too weird or impossible but Dallas took itself seriously but didnt always make it.Anyway good fun, and really long episodes, one episode is about 48-49 minutes just goes to show you how much commercials we are forced to watch nowadays"
5,Best one yet,"My Les Paul is 31 years old and has been played to death from coast to coast and has traveled to England and Korea in the baggage compartment of many airliners without an ATA - risky I suppose, but those ATA's are horribly heavy and difficult to store when not touring.. This is my Paul's 5th case. All others fell apart after 4 or 5 years. The handle on this case is the most comfortable of all - very well padded."
3,DON'T BE AFRAID NOT TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING !,"Don't be afraid, because even if it is in Sweedish, the sound is very good, but this CD is not as good at all as his 1st CD, ""Mitt Sjätte sinne"", which is just AMAZING!And his 3rd CD,""Petter"", is a mix between the first and this one and is good too, but not as good as the first one which is his best CD of all.If u want to hear the best sweedish rap, try too fint ""Mitt Sjätte sinne"". I live in Switzerland and me and my friends talk french, and we all agree that it is very good rap music. This CD get's a 3 stars, but ""Mitt Sjätte sinne"" would definitly get 5 BIG stars!"
4,Hot!,"this guy needs some serious airplay....especially in U.S. ppl who r into rap really should listen to Petter. i mean, true, he's rappin' in Swedish but it's all good. don't sleep on this guy, he's gonna be around for a while. what made me listen to him was when i saw his video, ""Saker Och Ting"". that was joint got me hype! the beat and his flow's top notch. u didn't need to understand him to enjoy this album. i got to say that if i were a music producer, had major paper and mad juice.....he'd be a serious name in this industry. ppl, cop this album."
5,Perhaps the most believable book about the paranormal?,"Matthew Manning grew up in an old house, a house we're led to believe that has a ghost. In this instance, though, the ghost believes that he's still alive (for the most part) and living in the early 18th century. He ponders what these people, these Strangers (the Manning family), are doing living in his house.Manning portrays an accurate and believeable tale concering his encounters with Richard Webbe, a 17th century 'Gentleman' with whom he corresponds through automatic writing. Webbe 'proves' his authenticity by having 500 people from the village (albeit the village from the 14th-19th century) inscribe their names on the wall of one of the rooms.A very interesting book, this will keep you enthralled and, as a bonus, also has a strange twist at the end. Thoroughly recommended."
2,Nothing you can't find on Youtube,"Basically, a gun geek being interviewed about the AR-15. Very little structure to the interview, somewhat rambling and filled with digressions and ZERO actual work done on the AR. He does field strip the gun, but if you need a video to do that, there's plenty of them on the Internet. Great for a brand-new owner with no knowledge, but even then this video suffers from a lack of actual demonstration. He doesn't even actually CLEAN it, just talks about doing so.It has been about a month since I watched this, but that's my impression of this video in a nutshell."
1,very weak ratchet,"I bought believing it would torque at 55lbs. It will not. It might be ok if all you want to do is spin a bolt. If you use a ratchet regularly don't waste your money. Price sold me. To me it is worthless, I'll never believe a cambell hausfield rating again."
2,"Delicious coffee, but it's all over the counter","Pros : brews a great cup of coffee, especially using the aroma setting which slows down the drip and brews a richer tasting coffee.Timer is handy and water level gauge is easily viewed.Cons : Horribly designed carafe. It is impossible to pour from this carafe without dripping all over the counter. The method we've learned to use, is to partially open the lid while pouring however, this also means your thumb is subject to scalding hot steam which escapes right at the handle hinge. Even this way, enduring burns and steam, the drips aren't avoided - - just lessened.Overall, not displeased enough to toss away, but would certainly not purchase again and would definitely not recommend."
2,Wouldn't buy it again,"Very dissatisfied with this coffeemaker. If you don't have the handle in just the right position, the filter fills up with coffee and will not release it into the pot. Can be extremely messy, believe me! Also, the pot itself is very dangerous. There is a hole at the top of the handle where hot steam escapes and could cause a bad burn. I have contacted customer service and received no satisfaction. I was told to hold the pot at the bottom of the handle. Try holding a full pot of coffee at the bottom of the handle while pouring. Right! No more DeLonghi for me. This coffeepot needs to go back to R&D"
1,Do NOT buy this!!,"This coffee pot makes the coffee takes awful...I don't know what it is in the material that it is made from, but the coffee tastes like metal."
2,"Unique features, unique problems.","The things that I like are: the 'aroma' feature and the steel carafe instead of glass. The things I don't like: the narrow curved opening for the water tank, and the 2 holes in back of it that direct your poured water onto your kitchen wall, the tiny unlit clock, the filter basket that's a hassle to line up, and finally, as mentioned in another review... partially unscrewing the carafe lid to pour the coffee??!!"
3,Better Than Most of The Others In Series,Who ever puts together these compilations has no sense whatsoever. Case in point--Rick Derringer and Marvin Hamlish on the same CD? This series could be much better if someone had of put some thought behind the song selection and sequence.....
3,Not one of the best disc in this series.,"Here is one of the weaker disc of this exhaustive look at the 70's. Personally, I could do without Mocedades and Sister Janet Mead. Terry Jacks is also another throw away. But, you do have Stealers Wheel, Black Oak Arkansas, Blue Swede and Redbone and that offsets the worst on this CD. This is one of the few disc in this series you will probably program to skip songs."
4,Frog Fest,"You've got to love a book that starts with a ""murdered,"" prize-winning bullfrog. Of course, that's just the beginning of Connor Westphal's adventures. This is a pleasant read--there is a warm voice and a sense of humor. I liked the main character and immediately started rooting for her. The book IS a little too didactic--Connor is deaf and her friend is blind, so there is information about both disabilities--but I still enjoyed the story. The small-town setting gives the novel more focus and even more credibility. I felt that I was right there in Calaveras getting ready to watch some jumping frogs--ribbet!"
5,This was an excellent book.,I was a very frequent reader as a young girl and I read this book when I was about 10 yrs old. I had little knowledge about the holocaust but this book opened my eyes to the horrible tragedy and was one of the supporting factors that instilled in me a sensitivity towards other nationalities and cultures. I think our present day school curriculums and social atmosphere would benefit greatly by introducing our children to 'personalized' accounts of tragic historical events.
4,Great insight into WWII,"I first read this book in my late teens before having any extensive knowledge of World War II and Germany's concentration camps. This is the story of Rosemarie who is incarcerated during her teenage years in such a camp. It tells in detail the trials and hardships of her years here including transportation on the death trains, lack of food, sickness, death and the loss of friends. It is insightful without being overly scary and morbid. The ending is really luminous. It is a great read, much better than some of the required drivel HS students are made to read now."
2,I Am Rosemarie,"Rosemarie is a Polish Jew who survived the atrocities of the Holocaust. Along with her family she is first sent to Westerbork, where she struggle to make friends and survive. Her family is then sent to Bergen-Belsen, where the conditions are considerably worse.Although this is an interesting book, it is a bit far-fetched. It describes the camps more in the terms of a bad summer camp rather than the death and work camps that they were. Further, it is a bit incredulous that the entire family was able to stay together and that they were never separated from their luggage. Although Rosemarie had lice, she was also spared from the hair cutting that was a matter of routine in the camps.I don't know how much of the story is true and how much is fictionalized. Overall, I would not recommend this book to those wanting to learn more about the holocaust."
3,"Entertaining,but a bit sick too....","This two Cd set of alternate takes of T.Rex classics is a mystery!Where did this company get such weird versions of these songs? There are crazy versions of familiar songs throughout this set.Disco versions of songs,fake live takes,and orchestrated sleazy versions too.None seem to be on any other compilation I have heard,some with good reason.But I have to say that I never got so many perverse laughs from a CD set before.It may be because I have heard the ""good"" versions of the songs and these crazy weird versions shocked and amazed me!?This is no place to start listening to T.Rex,but if gotten cheaply,this sure is a weird one for the fanatic!"
3,WHAT DO YO EXPECT FROM A DOLLAR STORE?,"My girlfriend picked this up years ago in a dollar store rack. I listened once and filed it away. Pulled it out this morning just to see if it was as weird as I remembered. As with the other reviews, it seems they licensed alternative vocals for Marc's songs, and went from there. It really is odd, but perversely listenable.I think Marc would've gotten a kick out of this."
4,"A good book, but a little confusing","This book was great! It held my attention and kept me guessing. However, it was a little too short for my taste, has anyone else noticed the Replica books getting shorter? And while the book was everything I expected from this great author the book was confusing in that it didn't explain much about Andy, he was just sort of there. Nor does it explain about wether Chris was collaborating with the 'caretakers' or not. All things cosidered this was a relatively good book."
1,Not what the picture shows,"The image for this product clearly shows a brass connector shaped like the plastic connectors - with an 0-ring around the male connector. It is the only brass connector I could find anywhere that looks like it will fit with plastic connectors (which is the only reason I can see that anyone would buy this particular connector).The actual product is a conventional brass connector, with the rubber seal in the female piece. It looks identical to ""Orbit Brass Hose Shut-Off Quick Connect Set 58285"" (which is half the price)."
1,"Looks good, but terrible quality of female connector","Product looks good and made as advertised from solid brass, however female connector of the pair is of bad quality. The middle part of the connector that is supposed to act as a gate to the water flow gets stuck and it is difficult to put it back into correct position. Thought I had bad luck just with one, but next one I have installed got the same problem the next day. I bought other set of brass connectors many years ago at Home Depot - these are still serving me in one of my two homes, but Home Depot now sells only cheap aluminum alloy stuff - if you need to buy a garden hose connector, look at different brand..."
4,great figurine...,"My 3 year old son loves Buzz Lightyear and has played with this toy almost daily for the last 10 months. The action figure has taken alot of abuse and has held up well, I wish I could say the same about the spaceship. The spaceship starting coming apart immediatley. If you're buying this for the spaceship, don't waste your money."
5,Daddys is the finest & best!!!!!!!!!!!,This cd is so awesome i play it every day.Daddy yankee is so good at what he does..!!!!I like him and support him.
4,Outstanding!,"This CD is simply amazing. The five new tracks are incredible. I dare you to listen to 'Rompe' or 'Machete Reloaded' and try to sit still. Energy simply flows from this album. Even if you can't understand a lick of spanish, you may still fall in love with this album, and reggaeton in general. Daddy Yankee is a genius, and he proves why he is ""El Cangri"" with this CD.Note- If you own 'Barrio Fino,' some of the songs may feel dated to you, however the new songs and the DVD make up for that."
1,Un happy,It was not what I was looking for! It was like a live CD and had people in back ground singing I am not happy with it at all:(
5,excellent energetic,excellent cd easy to dance to listen to or just chill to. it covers all the different friends from different countries i got. gives the drive home a kick
3,Not bad,I bought this cd just to get the song Rompe. All in all it isn't a bad cd but most of the songs I already had from other DY cds. I'm generally not much for recorded live music which most of this is.If you like recorded live music and DY this cd is for you.
5,Captures a very good year for Soul Music,"This CD concentrates on some sweet soul hits from 1970, a very good year for music that was kind to the ear. Here we have ""Ooh Child"" by the 5 Stairsteps,. a beautiful, warm tune that is my personal favorite song of all time. We also have ""Love Land"" by Charles Wright, who wasn't one o my favoirte artists but this was a damn good tune. The enclosed version of 'Love on a 2 Way Street"" by the moments is the short version, not the one with the classic ending ""Bye Bye baby, bye bye."" And there;s ""Love Won;t Let me Be Lonely"" by the Freinds of Distinction, with it's tempo changes that flow quite well. All in all, a first class collection from a very good year for this music."
3,Soul Hits of the 70's: Didn't It Blow Your Mind! - Vol. 2,"Just a so-so production. CD covers were the best creation and gave indication of good product, which proved to be just shallow advertisement."
1,Consider it bad karoake,Ever wonder what U2 would sound like with a different lead singer? This disc should answer that question. The only song I can recommend at all is Desire because of it's slightly more blues bar feel but it's still too much like the original. Buy only if you have money to burn.
1,Crap,"I love U2. It's my favorite band ever, but this is no tribute. It doesn't even deserve to have ""U2"" in the title. If you want to listen to U2, listen to U2! Not a crappy cover."
1,"NOT ""Even Better Than The Real Thing"" AT ALL !","I ONLY listened to the preview tracks at Amazon.com and I thought I would die. It's horrible. NO passion, no charisma, and most of all NOT the real voice U2 fans all know and love BONO. All I have to add is this is NOT ""Even Better Than The Real Thing"" called U2. U2 is the greatest band in the world bar none; and this tribute is not worthy at all. Save your money to buy the real thing and support the real band we all know and love as Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton, and Larry Mullen Jr. Long live U2 for another 25 plus years.Sincerely:The Bono Freak (:"
5,Peace of Mind,"Absolutely RECOMMENDED to purchased for electronic that doesn't last. Give the customer service a call once you brought this insurance. No question asked, you'll received your check and the return label for the product as long as your policy still enforced. LOVED IT."
1,Rip Off,"This is a horrible service plan. I turned in my mixer in January. They returned the wrong item in May. It took over a month to get another shipping label. I returned it and waited for them to send me my mixer. It is now September. I contacted them a few weeks ago and they said they are not sure what is going on, but will get back with me. Still no contact. It has been 8 months.The service contract representative said they cannot do anything about the place they contract with. So, I am stuck without a mixer."
2,Too complicated,"When calling to engage the warranty, there is no uniformity of service:1. Once, I had to call 4 times to get someone to help--the first 3 times, I was told, ""We'll get back to you.""2. Once, instead of allowing me to take the product to a local dealer, they made me ship the product to a repair service at my expense--box and mailing were almost $40.3. Once, I had to argue that I knew the repair could be done locally--had to speak with 3 representatives before the company agreed with me.4. Beware of Dyson's rehab vacuumes. Yes, I am grateful I have an extended warranty but the quality of service stinks"
3,Extended Service Plan - Soleus Dehumidifier,"I cannot due justice to a review, since I have not had to employ the extended service plan to date."
5,Great deal,"I purchased the 3 year sevice plan with my vacuum. I have very bad luck with vacuum cleaners. I go through about one a year. Anyhow, I hope I never have to use it."
1,useless service plan,I purchased this agreement to cover a reconditioned DC14 Dyson vacuum. The vacuum arrived not working out of the box. The suction transfer device did not work so the vacuum only had suction on the wand part. Also the wheel lock mechanism failed to work because it appeared to be broken.I called the service company who informed me I had to return the unit to Amazon for a refund or replace. Amazon told me they could not replace the unit so I had to have a refund which I've yet to receive. Now I have a 3 year service contract for $30 on a vacuum I can't get. I wasted my money I guess.
1,A pain in the bottom to cancel,I returned the item and this company wanted me to keep the warranty.(?????)Why ??? It took 3 transfers before they agreed to cancel warranty.
4,Happy With Service,My portable air conditioner broke down. The warranty company tried to get a local repairman to fix it but they were unable to locate a new part. I received a full refund by mail shortly afterward.They could have been a bit faster and communicated more with me about the status of my claim.I am happy that they ultimately backed up the product and allowed me to buy another one.

4,Unique one of a kind book for creative people!,"One may imagine learning how to free yourspirit easily and effortlessly.Great book for those who want more outof life and want to create elegant works ofart on paper and designing software todesigning houses, etc.Lots of references to other resourcesthe average person would not think to look.I enjoyed the parts concerning Synchronicity,Dreams and Mentoring."
3,An average book.,"I was disappointed in the book. It contains the usual bromides, but not much new stuff. It's becoming like if you read one book on creative thinking you've read them all."
1,Stinker!,"This book is one of the most trival ""works"" on the subject known. I think the author has hitched his wagon the the ""creative spirit"" train trying to take his knowledge to another level. Too bad the book is ripe with thoughts and ideas taken from more credible sources. Pass on this one if you are serious about idea building in business. I've heard the author lecture and that's just as bad. Better books are from the author, John C. Maxwell."
2,Okay,"This is one of the many ""okay"" books out there these days on creative thinking. There are so many books being published these days about creative thinking, one has to seriously wonder about the credentials of the many authors. This author is not exactly an expert."
3,As my creative doctor says....,"Say Aha.....This book, for me, is a solid 3.5... it's light on when it comes to techniques but full of good ol' fashioned homestyle advice in other ways. Want to be more creative: read more and read more broadly. Keep a journal. Make your creative ""space"" pleasant and interesting.Problem is, it sometimes feels that that's all you get. If you're looking for models to follow then this isn't your book. If you're looking to make a start on a more ""creative"" life - career, long planned novel - then this book hits the spot just right."
3,Good book,A good inspirational book for those who need inspiration. Well-written and informative but lacks the specific tools and techniques one needs to become more creative.
3,Learn to be a natural seducer.,"$250.00 but I learned and was told many things I haven't heard in over 40 relationship books I've read. I would suggest watching disc 4, the last one; first and than again at the end so you know where Zan is coming from. The dvd's are to long to go through all at once. I guess the only two things I didn't like is the same intro on all 4 dvd's and that they were so long (about hour each), but were worth it for the insights I recieved. Be a lover of all art and beauty. Women fall in love through their ears. Be comfortable with women. ""Everything and everyone prospers me, now."" ""Your entire future is in this day."" APPROACH FROM THE SIDE AND TOUCH THE SMALL OF HER BACK."
1,"I wonder how many times he mentions ""Hans"" in this book","The author posts regularly on a website called PUAHate.com with the username ""Zan Perrion bot""Here's a thread asking users to trash a competitor's product, and begging for reviews for this book:[...]As you can see, at the end of the post he mentions his imaginary friend named ""Hans."" He works this character into every post that he makes on the website. Maybe it was funny the first time, but 299 times (his post count as i write this)? Seriously?I'd be embarrassed to take advice (or give money) to someone so unstable and uninteresting."
4,Adorable Item - A Little Pricey,This item was a great product. The shipper sent it quickly. I found it later however on a different website for less money and wish I would have shopped around a little more first.
3,A Woman Would Rather Be Licked,"THIS IS NOT IN THE TOP 10 OF MARVIN SEASE BEST HITS BUT IT'S JUST OK.I'M A TRUE FAN, BUT THIS ONE I WOULD NOT PLAY AT MY PARTIES."
3,Needs more Action,"I love the actors in this movie, but the story line in not good at all. This movie does not let the actors go to their fullest potential. It was a good movie just not action enough for me. Sung Kang, I really love and Russell Wong, their characters was not used very good and not in the capacity that I am use to seeing them in."
3,Desk Calendar,"I guess I prefer the calendars that have the design throughout with more room for writing appointments, etc. These just have a little colorful scene off to the side. I need more room for writing in appointments."
4,A strong entry into the Hulk canon,"""Banner,"" a four-part novella written by Brian Azzarello and illustrated by airbrush master Richard Corben, is a strong entry in the continuing legacy of Marvel's jolly green giant. The story, which features General Thunderbolt Ross once again tracking a homicidal Hulk/suicidal Bruce Banner through the Southwestern deserts, follows familiar terrain. Corben does a great job physicalizing the destructive, sweaty violence when Banner ""Hulks out"" - - this is a very tactile presentation, and the action scenes are exciting. Best of all is the depiction of Doc Samson as a swaggering, overconfident jerk -- one of the least sympathetic views of his character to date. This is a quick read, but a good one. Worth checking out! (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue book reviews)"
2,A big dissapointment for this Corben fan.,"This is the first time that I can honestly say that I'm dissapointed by the work of Richard Corben. Corben's artwork was definitly not up to par. The faces of Doc Samson and the Hulk were to cartoonish and out of purportion. The Hulk looked like a big ignorant goofball!The story was [horrid]! Azzarello's story and script was dull and lifeless to say the least. I did not like how Doc Samson was portrayed like a thug. I do not remember him being like that back in my Hulk reading days. I will give this book two stars out of five. The two stars are for the Corben artwork that was interesting to look at, but not for his renderings of Doc Samson and the Hulk. Not worth the read!"
5,Emperor Jones,"Just finished it! This is the best play I have ever read. In fact perhaps the best piece of writing ever read. An incredible journey through the past of a black man, Brutus jones aka Emperor jones, who over comes life to become an Emperor of an island in the West Indies. Only to find he has become something he hates, predominantly a white man stealing and corrupting his own brothers. He remembers his past violently attacking it, until he is killed by his own beliefs, when he told the natives he could only be kill by a silver bullet, the natives coerced him with haunting drum beats in the night while they made the silver bullet. forcing jones to go mad, and break down to defeat. He runs in acircle right into the native silver bullet!"
2,Schiffer publishes beautiful books BUT...,"I love Schiffer, but I prefer Debby DuBay's books Antique Limoges at Home and Living With Limoges."
3,Easy to install keyboard overlay,"Good quality of lettering. Excellent adhesive. Easy layout to transfer stickers from the board to a keyboard. However, the stickers are not easily removed from the board leading to bending and fingerprints on the adhesive side of the stickers. Also in certain lighting the reflection from the stickers, especially from the stickers with the fingerprints, is making it difficult to see the letters."
5,THIS CD IS A MUST FOR AT HOME ENTERTAINMENT.,"EXOTICA IS THE PERFECT COMPLIMENT,LIKE FINE WINE, TO ANY GATHERING OF FRIENDS, FOOD, AND FUN. THIS COLLECTION FROM THE PAST WILL MAKE YOU WANT TO MIX A DRY MARTINI,PUT ON A POODLE SKIRT OR BANLON, AND TANGO THE NITE AWAY."
5,Wonderful CD to put you in a tiki mood,"After discovering Martin Denny on KaZaA, I simply had to have more of his music. This is an awesome compilation....it really gets you into a tiki vibe! High quality sound...good linear notes...just an all-around incredible experience. So pick this CD up, sip a mai tai and party!"
3,Enough with the awful bird calls!,"There's no doubt that the music that Martin Denny and his group produce can be very pleasant to listen to. Unfortunately, this pleasantness is marred by the constant and awful bird calls. I wish that Denny's music could be re-mastered and the bird calls left out of the mix so that we could REALLY enjoy the music. I prefer to listen to Arthur Lyman's nicer charts."
1,In a word - No!,"Hahahahahaha. No, but seriously. HahahahahahahahahaThis is seriously bad stuff and is no more of a tribute than it is some two bit pub band trying (and failing)to re-create a magic, than no-one but Oasis can.If you like music, you like Oasis and more importantly, like your general health, then it would be fair to say, thet this aint the record for you.However, if you like putting yourself through torture, then still, it's not even good enough for that.A tribute my ...."
1,Oasis Kidz Bop???,Yes this is what it sounds like....some do-over by failed artists....I seriously hope the boys dont know about this...it would send them to an early grave! This item should have a BIOHAZARD warning on it!!!!! Its extremely bad fer ya!!!
1,only for obsessed fans,"with the exception of all around the world, this album is laughable. As a fan of the group i felt i needed this to complete my collection. I was sorely dissapointed. The vocals on some of the tracks are terrible. Go let it out! for example made me cringe. The singer is trying so hard to impersonate liams snarling vocal and unfortunately fails to measure up.This is only one for an obsessive collector, anyone else would be so much better off getting the real thing."
1,RED PAGES,"I CANNOT STAND TO LOOK AT THIS RED BOOK! THE DRAWINGS ARE AMAZING, BUT IT HURTS! DUMB MOVE MORONS"
4,There should be an English-language translation.,"This appears to be a very good book for beginners learninig classical guitar -- instructions are so easy to follow that I can make most of them out even without reading German (it definitely helps to pronounce some words out loud in guessing their meanings...). The musical pieces are also easy enough that even as an absolute beginner I am finding that I can gradually pick them up, which seems about right for a beginner. It would be great if there were an English-language translation!"
3,Not as good as the first few,"I much prefer the first 4 books in the series. The fourth, Hunting Game, takes a turn for the political (animal rights) and this book continues that trend. This one is about the well endowed HH University using precious water to keep its campus lush and green, despite being located in the desert. I stayed with the series, but much preferred the books through Time Bombs. Cannot recommend ""COP Out"" and ""Casanova Crimes""."
4,Got a ticket for the Bay City Rollers,"If you ever find yourself bemoaning the current pop music scene, you can use this disc as evidence. If the Rollers were the worst we had at the time, they were still better than all of the so-called boy ""bands"" now, and here, they're playing a man short.Put 98 Degrees on a stage alone, and even assuming Nick isn't too busy feeding and changing his mentally challenged spouse, they still couldn't fill a room with music of this caliber. The tunes, vocal harmonies, and, yes, musicianship are all there in this live setting. Sure, N*Sync can dance, but is that any reason to buy a record?"
5,Awesome experience,"I have been a BCR an since I was 12 and hearing this live CD was just awesome! I never dreamt I would get a chance to hear the band on a live recording! The guitars are screaming, Eric is an incredibly talented musician, Les' vocals are sexy and fun! This is a must have cd for any fan, and the more devoted the fan, the more they will love this experience!!! Thank you!!!"
4,"A little bit deja vu, but an intriquing read","Having just finished all 6 books in the O'Malley series, they all carry the same theme with an unbelieving O'Malley being attracted to a believing partner. Book #4 is no exception. It's a little bit ""been here, done that"" with Jack as he meets Cassie. However, Dee Henderson kept my interest in the story line and she definitely did her homework in detailing the life of a fireman. She uses nuances in her writing to make the characters real and keep you attached to them. If you don't mind reading a bit of ""same song, different verse"", I'd recommend ""The Protector"" and each of the books in the O'Malley series."
2,"eh, a weaker O'Malley series book","I've read O'Malley series books up to this one. I will continue reading the series but this book is the weakest of all of them so far. Jack O'Malley is a caring man but acts in childlike playful ways (ie. smiley face on his fireman's coat, fake mouse thrown into people's laps). This character personality development isn't my cup of tea - instead of endearing, I find it immature. Back to the plot, arsons are erupting all over Jack's fire district. Along with his boss, Cole, and his love interest, Cassie; Jack takes on the task of learning who is setting these fires and why they are targeting Jack's shift. Jack sees God's love and comfort in times of tragedy in his cancer-stricken sister life, his love Cassie's fire accident, and finally in his own life."
4,I thought about firemen for days after reading this book....,The O'Malley's is a great series of books and this one compliments the series very well.I especially enjoyed the personal interaction that Dee Henderson seems to be so good at. I suppose I will never pass a fire station with out thinking about this book and that dreamy Jack.This one had a great story line and lots of other stuff going on around the main story.I liked it.
4,A good book,"I liked this book, but I liked the first three more. The plot was another good one. Firefighting is another interesting job, but I would have liked to see her focus more on Jack and Cassie and less on Rachel and Cole. Sometimes it seemed to be turning into their story. Still, the mystery was good and the characters are always enjoyable."
4,Deeper Story,"The Protector is a deeper book than Dee Henderson's previous books. I always enjoy reading these books because the characters are well developed and deep. In this book we get to know another of the O'Malleys...Jack. We also meet Cassie a fellow firefighter who was severly injured in a nursing home fire. In this story we see the fire department plagued with a string of arson fires aimed at the firedepartment itself...the arsonist seems to be determined to make a point. But what is the point? As the arsonist escalates it becomes a race to find out who it is, is it one of their own? The only thing as in the first few books that I would like to see improved is the endings, the come far to quickly and far to easily resolved, though I still love these stories"
3,O.K. but want more about the family,"While I enjoyed learning about Jack, I want to know and hear more about the rest of the family. Tell me about Dave about his sister, about the rest. After you've read about them, all you get is...Kate was helping Dave make sandwiches or Dave went to see his sister. Hello, these people have become important to us, that is what a series is about. Give us more about the characters and what they look like, etc. It seems Dee is turning these out too quickly or something."
5,"Math Teachers gives this ""Two Thumbs Up!""","This is an exceptional book that really gets kids interested in the geometric relationships and properties AND ALLOWS STUDENTS TO DISCOVER... After working with this book for a few lessons on Angle Properties, students begged to ""do patty paper!"" for every geometry lesson.Very do-able for teachers who have never used patty paper.Comes with great worksheets that corresponded well with my curriculum."
4,Great Explorations,This book is excellent if you are looking into teaching or learning geometry from a discovery based approach. I am a first year geometry teacher and picked this book up at the National Council for Teachers of Mathematics. It includes an incredible unit on fractals; I'm going to go buy some tracing paper right now to try it out.
4,Truth about Winning Eleven,"My review is simple, the game is awesome. The graphics are great and the gameplay is great. The only draw back is that every time you play this game, every foul is against you. The referee is always against you and never gives cards to the computer."
2,Not for someone over 5 foot,"Because I'm pretty short compared to most people (5'4) I thought this jump rope would suit me well. I've tried it a few times, and it can be difficult maintaining my workout because the rope is a little bit too short. I really wish I would have gotten an 8 ft rope instead. Along with that, because the rope is plastic and is bent during shipping, it has a tremendous amount of wrinkles and crinkles in it that make it hard to keep the rope going. If I had to do it again, I'd pass on this jumprope and spend a few more extra bucks and purchase something better. Only purchase this if you are buying it for a child under 5'0."
2,Not necessarily for fitness,I purchased this item as fitness related. I needed it for shorter people. It is just a child's jump rope for playing. But it will do.
3,"Nice rope, but short!","I should of purchased the 9' one, but since I am 5'2 figured this would be perfect. It is a nice rope for using at home, but it is on the short side."
1,Nothing we haven't seen before.,"I think that this is an attempt to reproduce the successful schema of Gotrek and Felix. The invincible trollslayer and his trusty cynic sidekick. Dan Abnett although a gifted writer, does here a poor job. I found all the stories except the last one, just plain boring. The main story of the book, the last one and the longest of them whole was a plain artistic steal. A bunch of good hearted mercenaries/Samurai defending helpless villagers from a bunch of robbers/ villains/bad mercenaries. I believe I've seen the movie twice before. As a whole, I recommend seeing Akira Kurosawa's seven Samurai instead of wasting your time with this book."
3,A warhammer fan,"This was a great book though many would consider it a rip off of the Gortek and Felix series. Quite the contrary as a matter of fact. Though I enjoyed reading this book ,as I seem to with all Warhammer Books, this book seemed a little to rushed in some spots and in others way to slow. The end ,to me, made the whole book worth while. Though it is somewhat not believable that a small group takes on hundreds of one of the most feared bands of mercenaries in the whole warhammer world. This book explores more of the life of Elves, finally they write a novel about elves, and their dying race in the warhammer world. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a fairly entertaining novel."
3,"If you get past the ego of the author, this is a great book",Really. Highly recommended. For getting started in this field.But some of the hyperbole is rather off-putting.
2,Biased and unfair,"The book is good for listing producers but the ratings are very biased and unfair. Unfortunately, there is no other major German wine book, that is current. Two scandals of fall 99 and spring 2000 revealed that the samples are not tasted blind and that Armin Diel even sold leftover samples. The wines of the top producers are great, no doubt, but the better values are found elsewhere. The authors have certainly helped Herman Doennhoff for example to establish his high pricelevel, while I found the wines of 99 that I tasted were not to that level. Great other winemakers are left out, because they do not grease the wheel, just make great wine. Check out the producers with the lower ranking and you find best values."
4,Wordly Wise 3000,"The book uses a good method of introducing words and then challening the student to use them through sentence completion, multiple choice as well as in a story."
1,Don't Buy It,"I agree with other review on Amazon for this item: totally useless, especially with new Wordly Wise 3000 books. Don't waste your money!"
2,"Corny, corny, corny!",I struggle with what to say on greeting cards. I always seem to say the same thing over and over. I was looking for a book that could help me...THIS IS NOT THE BOOK! It is filled with corny poems and strange saying that I would be embarassed to put on a card. I have had this book for 4 months now and have not used a single suggestion from it to-date.
2,Splat,"I was intrigued to see what Japanese writers might do with a Lovecraftian inspiration, having enjoyed both HPL's own stories and a smattering of enjoyably pulpy products of Japan's modern pop culture, along with one or two works of actual Japanese literature. However, this book reflects none of the careful atmospheric construction that marks the work of Lovecraft, and of the authors he admired. Instead, it almost immediately descends into graphic, grossout violent and slobbery stuff, with no pause to secure your suspension of disbelief. It's like reading a video game aimed at 12 year old boys. If you're curious about Japanese horror, skip this and tryJapanese Tales of Mystery and Imaginationby Edogawa Rampo instead."
5,AWESOME fit and look,"Shipping was fast. Easy instalation if your mechanically inclined. Otherwise if you have to have it professionally installed, it is well worth every cent. Sturdy and looks great."
1,"doesn't even cut it as a toy, just a piece of garbage",Don't waste your time or money with any product from this company. Support is nill and all they make is junk.
4,VERY SLIPPERY,I HAD TO BUY THOSE SHOE TRACKING APPLIQUES..BECUASE I WAS SLIPPIN AND SLIDING ALL OVER MY LIVING ROOM..I DIDNT WEAR THEM OUTSIDE UNTIL I APPLIED THESE! TRUE TO SIZE
1,More shtick than talent,"Godard shows more talent for self-marketing than he does for art. I probably shouldn't be surprised that people respond to his shtick (and his art, I suppose). There are a lot of people with terrible taste in the world.This book appears to have been designed by Godard himself. In other words, it lacks professionalism, looking more like a self-published book (it may have been) or a junior college student's graphic design final project.What can I say of his actual paintings... They are mildly amusing, but betray little artistic talent."
5,A Classic Recording,This is a great album full of some of Ken's best early works. It is a shame it is not on the mp3 downloads. Anyone who digs the 'dine should do themselves a favor and GET THIS ALBUM.
3,"freaky stuff, man","I'd never heard of Ken Nordine until just recently. Someone online suggested I give him a listen, so I bought this CD. It's a bunch of spoken word pieces recited by Ken Nordine, some with sound effects and music. Some of it's funny, and some just stupid. The language is interesting, though, since much of it is from the beat subculture of the 60s. You don't hear people talk like that anymore except in TV reruns. Or on Ken Nordine's CD."
5,hairbrush,I already have a scalpmaster hairbrush that I have had for at least 20 years. I was wanting to replace it because it is the only hairbrush that I feel I can style my hair with successfully. I was so happy to find one at your store and to receive such quick service in getting it to me. Thank you very much!
4,as I expected,"I like this product and have been using it for more than 10 years now. But I think the advertisement ""No rub"" is overstated. Lens gets to be clean better if you rub it oviously."
1,Not for my grand am,"I have had a cd player on the floor of my car for a while. My hope was to mount it in the dash. This unit does a fine job of holding the stereo, but it will not fit in the opening in the center console. The screw holes and mending plates would not align. I was left with the option to just stuff it in unscrewed or return to the box on the floor. I stuffed it in and will hope not to loose anything in the gaps. I have a 2001 grand am v6 whatever and this product dosn't fit the bill. However, it does look like it might fit in my 91 dodge ram."
5,Radio mounting Kit for Pontiac Grand Am 2002,The dealer who installed the Radio said there was know problems with the installation but just had to have a new harness.
5,Most Amazing,"This blanket is amazing! It washes beautifully and always looks like new. I cannot believe the softness, size and durability. I have bought 2 more and will buy for friends and family as a baby gift!!"
5,Wonderful Blanket,"Very soft, great size, washes well. The sage color is wonderful and was a great contrast to all the pink we received. Its a great size, too!"
4,"Great show, but...","... Randell Carver almost makes the first season of this otherwise excellent show unwatchable. The best choice the writers ever made was dumping him to the curb for Christopher Lloyd for the rest of the series. You'll notice his face isn't even on the box art. There's good reason for that. Nonetheless, if you can blot him out (like CBS did when they put this together) the episodes of the first season were pretty darn good.There are however some minor audio issues with this first set. Mostly random muffling likely having to do with the old original audio tracks fading away."
5,Taxi-the series!,This season (1) gives the background of a wonderfully comedic sitcom! It brings back memories for those of us who were around in the 1970s and it brings history to those who were not around! Taxi was one of those fantastic shows that will forever remain a classic!
5,IT'S ABOUT TIME!,"Taxi was one of the funniest shows ever written and I am so happy that I have the first season on DVD...All I can say is ""When is Season 2 coming out?"" Season 2 brings on as a regular Reverend Jim...Who can forget ""What does a yellow light mean?"" :-) Love Ya Guys! :-)"
4,good show,Taxi was a catch show. I dug the Bob James theme Song.i still got a crush on Marilu Henner. this show had a good solid cast that truly Complimented one another.Danny Devito was always a trip. a really good show that finally made it to DVD.
3,1970's comedy legends.,"Andy Kaufman is gone now but several of these actors got started and are still visible in all kinds of roles; not just acting. They are writing books, hosting talk shows and still adding character to movies and tv.The first season of Taxi is probably not my favorite. I especially liked the later seasons when Latka started having different personalities, one of which was Vick Ferrari, which I borrowed for my own Amazon pseudonym. Another was his beautiful imitation of Alex.For me the negatives are that some of the lines seem a little corny to me now and some episodes are less funny than others in favor of a human interest or emotional storyline. I really prefer the humor in a sitcom. But, when Taxi is funny it's incredible."
5,Danny DeVito's Magnum Opus.......................,"My goodness Danny DeVito can produce outrageous laughter. His portrayal of taxi-cab dispatcher Louie DePalma is his finest moment. Nothing he ever did in the movies is even 1/5th as funny as his work on the ""Taxi"" television show.I was in 8th grade when these episodes originally aired but I would go on to see these episodes in syndication many years later and many more times. But many of these first season episodes I don't remember and boy they are funny.This is some of the finest television comedy that has ever been done. In addition to DeVito's brilliance there is Andy Kaufman's work as Latka Gravas the mechanic. And of course Judd Hirsch, Marilu Henner are very good as well.If I could give this 6 stars I would; it's just that good."
5,"Of all the great sitcoms, this one makes me laugh the most.","Taxi is one of the greatest sitcoms of all time and as such it is highly underrated by most. Danny Devito is great as the insanely cranky dispatcher/boss of the crew but everyone on the show is somewhat crazy. Except for maybe Judd Hirsch who plays the ""straight"" character but gets tons of laughs with the way he deals with everyone. All the characters are immensely likeable in one way or another which is a key factor in making the show great. Who can forget characters such as Andy Kaufman, Christopher Lloyd, Tony Danza, Marilu Henner and Jeff Conway, all of whom played one of the best characters in their careers if not THE best."
5,Old 45s. Not like the wavetwisters.,"This reminds me of Cut Chemist and DJ Shadow's ""Brainfreeze Breaks,"" cutting, mixing and scratching old 45s. Intro opens with scratching and mixing Rush's ""Tom Sawyer"" to old skool rap, disco, to early funk music, and all kinds of old tunes from the 50s, 60s, and 70s, including, of course, sound bytes from old tv shows and even from the wavetwisters. There are 19 tracks, all untitled. The mixes are not flawless but is forgivable because it is supposedly live. Qbert's track selection is amazingly diverse, and often silly. The last three tracks sound like his usual, sci-fi style, wavetwister-like sound. I thoroughly enjoy listening to this album."
4,Jump rope - good stuff,Product is exactly what you would expect. Only slight downside was I bought this jump rope based on the blue rope/blank handle color scheme and got a purple one with yellow handles :( Oh well!
2,Bad choice,"I bought this jump rope because it looked like it was a speed rope. However it's anything but a ""speed rope."" The moment I picked it up it noticed how light weight it was, then I tried using it I realized the bad quality of the rope did allow it to travel through the air causing it to slow down significantly to the point were I was unable to use it... Instead of returning it I'm going to give it to my kids, it seems as though it was made for kids anyway."
2,You can get a better one at Walmart.,So I love jumproping. My jump rope that I had bought at walmart like five years ago broke from the handle because my kids love taking it outside and playing with all their friends. When it broke I decided to look here to so what was available because Amazon always has the best prices. Well I came across this jump rope only to find out it is not good quality. Im still using the one with the broken handle cause the material is alot better. I will have to go to walmart and buy the same one for the same price. As for lenght is was just right I'm 5'4 and it works okay but its cheap.
5,It's a jump rope...it does the job,"It's perfect for a teen, or an adult. Not small children. It's a jump rope, it does what it's made to do. Simple as that."
3,What i thought.,Well for $8 i think i can get a better jump-rope. Did not know how cheap this one was.
5,Nice surprise!,"I didn't even know there was a moon on the other side of this little guy! I love it, it's cuddly, and it has multiple danglies for lots of fun. I will eventually collect all of the Lamaze toys."
5,Fun toy for baby girls,Great gift for new mothers and baby girls. My daugter loved her smily sunny face and we put it in her crib and stroller. She has outgrown the toy but it has been passed on to our niece who loves it. Toy has lasted more than 5 years so far and is easy to clean.
5,loved the look,I bought the Nautica comforter for my son who is two and was looking for a matching valance. Even though it is to match the nursery set it matches the adult quilt and looks adorable in his room. Good quality for the price.
3,american harvest mod #6041,when tring to hook up a thermostate be very careful after the set point is hit on the stove the fresh air blower willslow in speed to the point that the flame will be lazy and cause black soot could cause a fire! you can not adjust the exhust blower while in auto/thermostat mode it does what it wants.you will not be able to run at lower temp's in auto/thermostat mode be cause of the fresh air blower running too slow.you will also use a lot of wood pellets while in auot/thermostat mode so i just run in manual mode.i called usstove about it and they said it is what it is.other then not being able to use the stove in auto manual mode will have to do.
3,So far so good,"I've had this stove for about a month now. It produces a nice hot fire. I am heating about 2500 ft sq with it and it's keeping the house at about 65 degrees with an outside temp of about 25. I up the heat setting a night and back it off during the day.Just one thing to note so far, the out of the box combustion-air settings need to tweaked a bit. I noticed that the default setting at each heat level don't provide enough air. Not a big deal since you can adjust it by manually opening the draft control slightly. Supposedly the electronics can be programmed to do this automatically which I might have the dealer do for me."
5,Fantastic!,"I love this series! I bought it for our six-year old daughter to teach her about virtues which are hard to come by in today's society. She loves them and watches them over and over. A great alternative to all the ""junk"" our children watch today."
1,Violent and Disturbing,"I sure hope that this product is different from the one I have been watching on Netflix. In episode 2 titled Honesty, there is the story of the ""Indian Cinderella"". In it, two older sisters put on scary masks and attack their sleeping younger sister with a hunting knife, slashing at her hair violently. They then force her out of her bed at knifepoint and it is implied that they burn her face on hot coals to disfigure her so she would not be considered as a bride for a warrior.. I fell off my couch trying to turn it off before my child saw anything. I understand the importance of a good lesson but really, is it worth that level of graphic and implied violence in a child's show?"
3,Not Everything I Expected...,"The eel is cute but extremely small (ex. he fits in my pocket). He's very durable and has a cute little (very little) face, but is not exactly the quality eel I had hoped for. I guess for the price it's not a big deal, just be aware he's a miniature and if you cover his face he looks like a little piece of seaweed."
2,very small,very very small. I should have read the review. it will not work for what I wanted it for. i guess I didn't look for size info before buying it.
5,A must have,"I Just got this book in the mail yesterday and read it cover to cover, the book is filled with so much information. I love to garden and this book has already showed me so much I did not know, like japaneese beatles are really grass grubs grown up! I even looked it up online i just did not beleive it and it's true.I love to feed the squirrels but if I keep doing it they will have bigger litters and cause an over population in my back yard. this book goes on and on with so much information I just orders another of jerry's books and can not wait to get it. but until then I will start useing some of his tonics. this book is a good buy the one thing I can not find Jerry talks about a weather proof tonic in this book and I can not find the recipe in it anyware??? oh well still love the book I'm going outside to play in my dirt."
3,Backyard Problem solver,He says he uses natural ingredients. I don't think ammonia is natural. Some stuff looks good enough. I'm glad I didn't pay much for it.
5,great product and,great help for any one who does the garden thing small time of the 2 acres as we do so much to gain from this book for knowledge and salvation of your garden or -planting weeding etc.;
3,Good for cat Very bad for dog,"My cat absolutely loved this toy. I got it for him for Christmas and with in a few months he had ripped the butt open by kicking his back claws into it when he played. Around then we got a lab puppy. We tried to keep the cat toy away from him, but one day when I wasn't looking he got ahold of it. Inside the mouse is a bag of small rocks he ripped apart the bag and got it all over the carpet and digested a lot of it. Ergo, if you have a dog that would be semi interested in this toy be advised of the potential hazard inside. Other wise it's my cats favorite toy, even tho it didn't last very long."
2,Disappointing,"For a baby memory book it is really lacking in space. I love Linda Spivey's work and, in fact, used a previous book for my older son. The wording is very special, but the pages and binding are entirely too small for a memory book. Storing mementos in it is out of the question."
5,"Have A Nice Day Vol, 13","Have A Nice Day vol,13 I got in the latest of the series, I think the 70's were a great time in music and this cd is also great it has:Midnight At The Oasis,My Girl Bill. Radar Love,Rock Me Gentlythis cd as 12 tracks and being the 70's just Great!"
3,Not Bad,"It's not a bad CD. There are songs that would pair well with Radar Love, My Girl Bill and Rock Me Gently aren't two of them. That said, it's not a bad disc from which to make another. Burned it to my hard drive and made a great CD using this others from the ""Have A Nice Day"" series. Wish I could afford them all."
5,I have almost the whole collection,I can't begin to describe this CD only one word comes to mind AWSOME!!!!!
4,"Good, if not great songs from the mid 70's","""Have A Nice Day Volume 13"" features some nice pop tunes from the year that spawned Watergate-1974. ""Midnight At The Oasis"", ""The Night Chicago Died"", ""Please Come To Boston"", ""Rock Me Gently"", ""I Can Help"" and ""Life Is A Rock (But The Radio Rolled Me)"" are the pick of the litter here. Both tunes by Bo Donaldson And The Heywoods, titled ""Billy Don't Be A Hero"" and ""Who Do You Think You Are"" are just average, while the Jim Stafford song ""My Girl Bill"" is a little too silly for my tastes. Ranking right up there with the other primo tunes in this collection is ""Radar Love"" by Golden Earring. So, take your pick here and enjoy ""Have A Nice Day-Volume 13"", the only CD series endorsed by Mick Foley (WWF's Mankind, aka WWF Commissioner). HAVE A NICE DAY!!!"
4,Starts slow but ends big.,"With ""Midnight At The Oasis"" starting off the CD, you could think that this disc will be a wash. But, just a couple of cuts down, you will find ""Radar Love"" ""The Night Chicago Died"" ""Keep On Smilin"" ""Rock Me Gently"" ""Beach Baby"" and ""I Can Help."" My favorite on this disc is ""Life Is A Rock But The Radio Rolled Me,"" a look back at the present and the past, done just a little different. One Bo Donaldson & The Heywoods song is enough, so one could have been replaced by something else. But, this is yet another gem of a CD showing the inconsistancies of the 70's."
5,The definitive book on the 1944 Browns,"This book has everything you wanted to know about the 1944 Browns and then some. Mr. Heller shows that the Browns were indeed a good team on their own and not just lucky because it was a war season. Even though I knew how the season turned out, the book still kept me in suspense! This is not just for St. Louis Brown fans, this is for *ALL* baseball fans."
3,Could have been so much more...,"First, let me say that I really like the song ""Someone To Call My Lover."" But... only two tracks? The JD So So Def remix is okay, but there are tracks on the import single that are so much better, and should have been put on the American single. For instance, the club mix is really good, and the Velvet mix is cool. I've also heard an instrumental version and an acapella version (from janetworld.com) that would be good additions to this single. Oh well... the single edit IS better than the original (I'm glad they cut out that little digital break - it gets annoying) and the JD mix, as I said before, is okay. But I was expecting more."
1,I'd have gave this CD no stars but it wasn't a choice.....,"Man, this has to be J's worst song she's ever recorded. And have you saw the video? She doens't even ""mouth"" it well.....does she even know what part she is supposed to be singing? Anyway, for the CD.......I have no idea what Virgin was thinkin when they released this song. There are better songs on her new album, All For You.....not many, but there are atleast a couple better songs. ""Son of a Gun"" is better, but her using the F word every 5 seconds wouldn't make me wanna buy it either. Janet, what happened to you? You used to make awesome music......now you just cuss and moan - it ain't right."
3,Recommend,"I couldn't find a mat to fit my extra large sink and thought this might be the ticket. It does protect the sink, but gets in the way more than a mat does. I don't really see the value in it. The best to be said is that the sink can be rinsed of debris without removing it as you have to do with a mat. It seems more sanitary than a mat for that reason. The hinged metal segment to allow access to the drain doesn't work right because of how it sits in my sink. This accessory might be fine for some, but it doesn't work for me as well as I'd hoped.I'm adding this note after much more time using this product. It actually turned out to be very useful. I have a mat in one side of my double sink and this in the garbage disposal side. This rinses much better than the mat side without having to remove it. And, even better, the metal grid can serve as an in-sink dish drainer. It cleans up well and is very sturdy. This won't let me raise it to 4 stars but I do now recommend it."
2,Plastc Frame is the Downfall,This product would be great if the white plastc frame didn't bend in the sink under weight. The frame also needs to be bleached to clean it. I am replacing it with somthing better.
2,Rust problems,"After 6 month of use, the solder joints have started to rust. I've tried cleaning them, but the rust keeps coming back."
5,rubbermaid review,"Love, love, love this replacement sink protector...have been looking everywhere for another one for over a year. No one had it..not Walmart, Target, Lowes, Home Depot.....just couldn't find it. My best friend told me to check on Amzaon and there it was....I ordered three!!! After daily usage, it does tend to rust out in the soddered corners after a year or two. We don't have a ""centered drain"" in our stainless steel double farm sink...this works perfectly and still shows off the stainless steel sink...please keep them in stock...I'll be ordering them till I die or move!Thank you. /SMWC"
3,only thing to fit my sink,I have side by side sinks. It is only thing to fit the small side. I had one previously & wanted another. It will eventually rust in spots so I do have to clear rust ocassionally but it is worth the effort.
2,Too much thermodynamics; Too little on the age of oil,"Disappointing. This book has a great, concise summary of Hubbert's Peak by Kenneth Deffeyes in the first chapter. Then the author gets lost in a discussion of the history of thermodynamics (his favorite subject maybe?). I was disappointed. You would be better off just buying Hubbert's Peak - or for a more entertaining view, The Party's Over by Richard Heinberg."
3,"Realistic, good introduction to fuel issues","Great overview of energy and fuel in current society. It explained some that I already knew, but never went too wonky or too simplistic. The future of fuel and energy production is already a contentious issue and one that the US as a whole is still somewhat unrealistic about and doesn't seem to want to grasp - the idea of the end of oil and other supposedly unlimited resources. The author does a good job of sounding an alarm along with suggestions of what we could be doing differently.My only frustration was the author's obvious bias towards nuclear energy, but to be fair, he makes his point for its support and yet doesn't walk away from the argument of its safety issues completely. However, he doesn't delve as deeply into solar and wind energies as I would have liked, either. Overall, though, it is a short book and a great read for an introduction to the issues at hand."
4,the end of oil,A simple easily read and understood description of the mess we are in written by one of the great teachers of the modern era. The only problem with this is getting it across to the people that matter. We will all end up in the desert on shank's pony if nothing sensible is done. Alternatively knee deep in horse manure.
2,Briefly Disappointing,"In the age of the paper-guzzling 600-page door-stop, Prof. Goodstein is to be congratulated for writing a brief book. However, he may have thrown out the baby with the bathwater.The heart of the book is a discussion of thermodynamics -- but Prof. Goodstein does not tie it well to the problem of increasing demand for energy exceeding the global capacity to supply oil. His analysis of possible future energy sources seems generally correct, but his discussion is too brief to convey much information. Then there is the usual lazy political correctness that has become such an unfortunate feature of so much of the writing of US academics.The concept for this book was great, but it was disappointingly executed -- a real missed opportunity."
2,"physics A, economics F","Yet another natural scientist with expertise in his own field while failing to understand basic economics to sort through the ramifications of scientific findings. 1) as the supply of gas/oil decrease, the price increases leading to less demand 2) the author holds out little hope for technological gains over the next 20-30 years, yet this is completely unconvincing. 3) Goodstein's narrative of the 1973 oil embargo is flawed as he fails to mention US government price controls more than OPEC were responsible for the winding lines at the pump.In the 1980s, a group of Stanford scientists modeled the supply/demand of oil for 1997. They predicted around $80/barrel when in fact oil was under $20/barrel. Goostein's predictions will prove about as accurate. 2 stars for content discussing the natural science aspects."
1,waste of energy,"The conclusions may correct but this book is unconvincing, The only positive is it doesn't waste much time to read because there isn't much content. The author is another Mr smarty panty who doesn't have time to gather data to support his conclusions. A 30 second search on the net yields more information. Who cares about entropy? Really?"
1,Waste of Time and....Energy,"The author argues that ethanol, in addition to some other energy sources, need more energy to produce than the energy produced from them. This book is exactly like ethanol. More energy wasted to produce it than the benefits from it. In fact, the ratio is ethanol is much better!It is not worth reading. It looks like some one expressing himself about certain issues: no evidence, no substance, no solutions. Even newspaper editorials are more serious than this monograph."
4,It is what it is!,"I was really suprised when I saw the games look just like the ones I played about 25 years ago! The paddle controller was very smooth and persise. The total controller was a little bulkey, but it does house everything including the batteries. Hookup was easy. All-in-all, I think it is a hit!"
2,No Kaboom! = No Deal!,"Seriously, no Kaboom! How does this even make sense? It was the preeminent paddle game for the 2600."

2,ok but The Rosacea Diet is Much Better,This book is ok but The Rosacea Diet is a lot more helpful and a wealth of information; I highly recommend it instead.
5,great book,What a great idea! The co-authors of Finding the Path are really onto something. One of them is a psychologist and the other one the mother of three teenagers. The novel they wrote is exciting. It's about a mother's struggle todeal with the changes that arise in her realtionship with her son when he becomes a teenager. The best part of this book is that it is easy-to-read and it has footnotes that document the psychological theory behind the story. All of this makes the book a fun read and a learning experience for stressed out parents of teenagers - and there are many of us! I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to turn their relationship with their teens around before it's too late. This is a must-read book!
5,A unique kind of parenting self-help guide,"Collaboratively written by Jeffrey P. Kaplan (a licensed psychologist with a full-time practice specializing in adolescent psychology and stress management) and Abby Lederman (a freelance journalist who facilitates workshops for parents of teens, and who teaches parenting courses), Finding The Path is a unique kind of parenting self-help guide that presents its ""love-based parenting"" plan showcased within the context of a fiction novel about a single mother and her rebellious teenage son. Extensive endnotes and appendices help bring into relief the practical and sound advice for parents everywhere trying to figure out their teenagers. Sometimes fiction can be effectively in the service of providing useful and usable information -- Finding The Path is highly recommended as being just such a novel."
5,A must buy!!,"A really amusing book - makes a superb present for any cat or cat loves. Very amusing, true to cat life and great illustrations by Erika Oller."
4,depressing,"This story, like most of Lowry's novels, is an easy, quick read. It only took me a couple hours to read through it. The story line was interesting and the characters were believable, but the entire book is so depressing that I didn't walk away with that ""feel good"" stuff that I like to get from a good book. The ending is the most depressing part and, dare I say???....a cheap cop-out. Sorry Lowry. I'm a fan, but not of this ending."
1,Terrible!!!,"I read this book as a young child... first grade probably. I am currently 19 years old and still remember this book vividly! (This is not meant as a compliment!) It is hard to forget reading about things such as the beheading of a small boy! Perhaps I was too young to read this book. Regardless of this fact, however, I reccommend avoiding this novel for fear of scarring your child for life. In any case, AUTUMN STREET falls quite short of the calibre of the typical work by Lowry."
1,Didn't last long,"These were kind of worthless, they barely lasted any time at all before the coating was rubbed off. I did use light pressure on them, as the instructions stated."
1,Don't throw away your files.,"These may be useful on some thin plywood or balsa wood but for anything else you'll find yourself filing/sanding by hand after spending way too much time with these. Just a thick blade with a not so durable abrasive coating. The thick blade makes them ineffective for detailed scroll work and the abrasive coating fills fast. You could get as good, if not better, results from a nail file or the cheapest set of mini files from Harbor Freight."
2,har ripper,This product is junk. I used it one time and never touched it again it ripped the hair but did not cut very painful
2,False Advertising,"The rest of this album might be legit, I cannot say as I only bought one song. Early One - Jig Jig Jig. I don't know who is preforming this but its not Early One. Don't waste your money here. Back to youtube every time I want to hear the real song..."
1,And they actually have the nerve to call this a tribute,"After listening to this so-called tribute to Canadian singer Alanis Morissette, it sure did remind me of how talented a singer Alanis is. Her unique vocals are unmatched and this ""tribute"" album proves that. This album is clearly a joke or a sincere effort to honor Alanis made by some untalented singers. You Oughta Know, Joining You and Right Through You are hilarious, though So Pure and That I Would Be Good are decent. If you're a huge Alanis Morissette fan, skip this! This is a terrible effort!"
1,There are no words...,"What I cannot understand, for all my trying, is why Alanis Morisette signed off on this. It's terrible! Alanis Morisette is not a good artist because of wonderful singing voice, she is a great artist because of the purely unique approach she takes to everything, including singing. She doesn't have the voice of Mariah Carey or Faith Hill, and that's GOOD. Every syllable is packed with emotion and enunciatined in just the right way to get across what she wants to get across. THIS is a sad attempt at making Alanis Morisette's music more...pop-y. It's as if they are saying, ""Well, she had good lyrics, and catchy tunes...if only she could SING."" Which is stupid and not even worthy of a review. Forget this."
1,What the hell is this?,"Seriously, though! This has gotta be a joke! It just sounds like one woman doing some cheap Alanis karaoke, and trying to sound like a few different people. I'd laugh if it wasn't so depressingly pathetic. Its only ""saving grace"" is the fleeting hope that maybe it really is some kind of sad joke. I just pray that nobody put any REAL effort into making this mess, but, from what I can tell, I don't think you could put less effort into anything."
1,What is the point of this album...???,"Thankfully I tried the samples of this album first....what can I say...truly horrible!!No one but Alanis can do these songs justice...she sings with her heart. This is just WRONG!!!Oh my, I don't know what else to say, apart from...I'm off now to listen to the original & get the memory of this effort out of my head!!!Sorry to whoever recorded this album, I'm not a nasty person, but I have never listened to anything so bad before....Don't give up the day job....:o)p.s. That I Would Be Good is one of my all time favourite songs...hearing this version made me want to weep...AWFUL..UGH!!Just my opinion.......xx"
4,Great driver - good value,"Fast shipping, good price, great driver. only a couple scuff marks on bottom of club. Great condition otherwise. Easy to hit on the course."
5,A lively coverage of maps,"Val Ross' Road To There is a book on cartography and tells of the men and women who made maps, from road maps to sailor's charts. Road To There is a lively coverage of maps, from fraud artists who distorted maps for political gain to slaves who escaped to freedom from pieced quilts. An unusual, intriguing book, readers of all agens (many an adult!) will relish Road To There!"
2,Talk stations have poor audio,"I purchased the Stiletto 100 and was not happy with the quality of the audio for the talk radio stations. I have the FM Direct connection and there was distortion (very high pitch agravating tone). Took the 1st one back and gave it a second shot, still the same results!The internet radio option is great and it was great being able to walk the dogs and listen to the radio, but in my truck, just didn't work for me.Maybe the ""best possible connection"" (CD quality above FM direct) would have helped, but wasn't interested in spending the extra $100 to get it installed that way."
2,Fustrating Customer Service,"Once set up the radio is great but getting there is the problem. I did not find any clear explanation on how to set up the radio or what I needed. The antennas do not plug directly into the unit but into the dock so you need to purchase a car or home kit which amazingly was not available in the four different stores I walked into (yayy Amazon had it), it is difficult to get a signal from the house etc... I had to call customer service seven or eight times and was met with an uncooperative computer, operators who were not knowledgeable of helpful in any way and I was put on hold and hung up on repeatedly. I had to buy additional parts to reduce the volume and control the background hum from the radio which I discovered by talking to other Sirius customers not tech support."
5,Love it-Finally getting my money's worth!,"Before I purchased the Stiletto, I felt that I was not getting my money's worth from my Sirius subscription. Now that I can listen to all of my favorite Sirius chanels through my wireless Internet connection, I am now enjoying Sirius like I should. The design of the Stiletto SL100 is great. It is small enough to fit into a pocket, or use a case and clip to your belt. It came with both a slim battery and a longer life battery. I found that I can listem to my Stiletto for at least three hours and still have 2 bars of charge left with the thicker battery. The sound quality is great, and having 800MB of music storage is also a plus; it keeps me from having to bring my iPod on trips if I want to listen to my own music.Overall, I am very pleased with my Stiletto SL100. Good job."
2,An embarrassment to engineering,"An embarrassment to engineering...that's about the best I can say about the headphones and the ear buds included with this unit.The head phones are incredibly uncomfortable...basically hard sharp pieces of plastic that stick in your ears. About the longest I could wear them was 20 minutes at a time. Not only uncomfortable but awkward too...as soon as you move they will shift on your head. I tried to use it for construction work and it was impossible.The ear buds are no better and even though I'm working out in the middle of a field, the signal drops off constantly. About the only way to use this thing is as a MP3 player...and there are a lot cheaper and better MP3 players.Several reviewers mentioned how bad they are...I ignored them...silly me."
1,"Junk, Junk, Junk","A totally worthless satellite radio which never should have seen the light of day. Unless you live where there's: NO TREES, NO BUILDINGS, NO CLOUDS IN THE SKY you will hate this terrible product."
3,This is my third Sirius receiver,I already have Sirius in my house and installed in my car but my husband bought me the Stiletto for Xmas so I could listen when I have downtime in my office. I love the graphics and the way the product looks but it is tough to get a satellite signal indoors and since I don't have internet at my office the Wi-Fi connection is mostly useless to me. I can get a signal when I put the Stiletto next to a window. The optional headset with a built-in antennae is a joke. It is so heavy it falls off my head and the ear pieces feel like torture. The soft pads included for comfort just will not stay on but they don't make a difference anyway. The regular ear buds are fine. The product is expensive for what it is but I am a loyal Sirius customer because of Howard Stern and I hope it will work better in the future as more people become Sirius customers and the satellite technology becomes stronger.
1,Trash!!!!,I got this for my husband for his birthday and it didn't work. We spent hours on the phone with tech support to find it had probably sat in the warehouse too long. Hopefully I will get some sort of reimbursment from Amazon.
3,Stiletto SL100,"I didn't realize that it didn't come with a car kit, this was the whole purpose in buying it. So, far I'm paying for service and am unable to listen to it."
1,Sirius Satellite will never give you peace,"I got Sirius satellite with a new car over a year ago. The service was good, I actually enjoyed it. However, to me it wasn't worth 10 bucks a month, so I let it expire.Over the last month I've received daily calls from Sirius to get me to renew. I've told them no, I've told them I want off their lists. Yet the calls continue.Daily annoying phone calls have convinced me that I will never, ever use them again. No company should be so desperate for customers.I highly recommend you stay far, far away from Sirius. (And probably XM too since they are merging)"
3,Sirius Mixed Blessing,"The recording ability is great. Connected to car/home satellite antenna it works well. The portable headphones have lousy reception, as in I'm traveling down a highway with blue skies above me and poor reception with the portable antenna because there are trees 200 feet from the road. Oh and the headphones ARE painful because they are solid plastic and they feel like a vice after a while. BIG HINT - The automobile docking station has POOR FM transmitting capability( I tried a couple ) the solution was to get a Sony cassette adaptor and plug it in from the docking station in to my car's cassette player. So much better."
3,Useful,This product is useful for holding music but it is a bit bulky. There are newer versions of the satellite radio which can record more hours of music and have other functions.
1,Sirius SL100,"While this device is an excellent product, I got stuck with a defective one and was not able to use it in my car. Don't buy this."
5,Steletto 100 is great if used as portable recorder,"This radio works great when used as I do. I keep it in a home kit that has the antenna outside. While it charges two batteries, I record up to 100 hours of music/programming. I then have a great portable device that does need reception. As a sat. radio it has 4/2 hours (big battery/small battery) of capacity, but it is 20/10 hours when playing recorded music/programming.So if you want a device that works like an Ipod and can be filled with 100 hours of entertainment, get it with the home kit and you will be happy and never want to listen to live radio again. It is very much like a Tivo when used in this manner"
2,Acquiring Signal.....,This will be the message you receive unless you have a totally clear shot of the sky. So far this thing will not pick up a satellite signal at my house or at my office. It is pretty much useless for me. I am going to sell it at a huge loss..Satellite radio is a great medium that really needs to figure out a way to deliver the product. they will never get ahead with products like this that are completley useless..Updated review: I finally found a signal at my house when I put the home attena on my roof. So now I record 6 hour blocks so I can listen to Sirius at work. Only problem now is that during the playback the Stilleto freezes up over and over and I have to press the ff button to get it to start playing again. How much did I pay for this thing $350 ? What a nightmare..
3,Eh,"I got this for my bf as a gift. He's pretty happy with it, however it doesn't work inside. The headphones that have the antenna built in are big and ugly. The recording feature is great though! This way he can listen to his recorded songs when he's inside, at the gym, etc."
3,"No Satellite in Juneau, Alaska","Stiletto does not work in mobile mode with antennae headphones connected. Sirius satellite does work in docking mode in either home, or car. Assume higher 12 volt docked antennae system, and the 5 volt headphone antennae the difference between working, and not. Mobile internet connection works so decided to keep Stiletto. These findings are base on Juneau, Alaska location."
3,"Step Forward, Perhaps Some back","Because i am traveling a lot more this year, i chose to get the SL100...I know the Stilletto 2 came out but its features didn't seem to distinguish itself much from the SL100 so i went with that one. For the past few years i have used the Sportster 4 and boombox at home. My first ""alarming"" difference is that the SL100 does not have any time features - such as sleep timer, alarm clock, etc. That was a very used feature for me and nowhere was it noted that the SL100 does not have these features.The second thing is that i have had inconsistent recording issues in my short time using it. FOr instance, i set up a 6 hour block, and all that was recorded was 60 minutes. I'm sure i will figure out bugs and how to work around them as i move forward, but if anyone can let me know shortcuts they have for successful recording and/or potential ways to get an alarm clock with it, i'd appreciate."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"All I have to say is ""Don't waste your money!!!!"". Wait a few more years when the technology gets better in portable satellite radios!!! I had brought both the S-50 and the Stiletto radios and they're both garbage!!If you want a very good Sirius radio, buy the Sportster 4 and the portable boom box. Purchasing both is still cheaper then the Stiletto by itself!!! (Plus you get a car kit with the Sportster 4, not included with the Stilletto.)"
5,How do you not love this thing?,"I am only going to highlight the two most impressive features. I based my decision to buy this on these two only (not the headphones which I will never use)1. It backs up hours and hours of music AUTOMATICALLY2. You can record programming easily (like TIVO) Stern fans, this is great for the shows that are only on at nights that you wouldn't just sit around to listen too (SF Roundtable ect.)Baba Booey Baba BooeyEnjoy."
2,Reception Issues Cloud A Nice Product,"I live in the San Francisco Bay Area and haven't been able to get a consistent reception for a couple weeks. The broadcast is continually interrupted because of this.I even returned my original unit to Sirius for a replacement, but it wasn't much better. Tech Support did say that a small percentage do have defective receivers.As much as I would like to enjoy the service, at this price point, I will wait for the next generation model which will hopefully address this."
2,Big Disappointment,"Don't believe the hype. The Stiletto has been hailed as the ultimate satellite radio gadget, but its performance is dismal. To call the satellite reception 'spotty' is a huge understatement. Yesterday I stood in an open field, held it over my head into a clear sky, and could only get an intermittent signal. I also have an S50, and it is without question the superior device (at a much more reasonable price). I'm not knocking Sirius, because it's a fantastic service. But in my opinion, the Stiletto is a colossal waste of money. 350 bucks? Ouch!"
3,Satellite Radio,"The end result will likely be a higher rating; however, right now it has been returned to Silatto because it wouldn't power up. I am still waiting after a week and a half for them to either return it or send me a new one."
3,You Better have WiFi!,"The Sirius Stiletto SL100 is totally useless unless you have a fast 802.11b connection from the Internet. Otherwise you can forget getting a decent reception inside your house or office. It is also not able to record off of the internet connection! You have to have a satellite connection to do that or even go to your favorite stored stations! Remember,802.11b is the only WiFi that works with this unit! Not 802.11g,802.11e or any future WiFi signal! I took it to work but could not get it to connect to our WiFi connection because they only use 802.11g."
2,Disappointment,"I'm a big fan of Sirius in my car and thought this would extend that enjoyment beyond the car. That has not proven to be the case. Reception is awful, even with the headphone antenna. I can't get reception in the house, office or even the car. I purchased the home kit and I'm having difficulty locating a place where that gets reliable reception. If you can't use the satelite reception the internet reception is a backup, however, not all the features work in this mode. You will not be able to save tunes when in the internet mode, only the satelite mode. Saving tunes is the key feature. I am looking into a roof mounted antenna. All these options will drive up the cost of the device (roof antenna, home kit, cable, etc.). If the reception issues casn be resolved then the device may live up to the expectations. I'll keep trying. Wish me luck."
5,WHAT A GREAT IDEA!,"I don't know who thought of this, but it's such a great idea. My daughter is 4 and just loves it. This has become our nightly routine. She used to fuss at bath/bedtime, but now she can't wait to sing the songs and pretend she is a princess (which she is!). I only wish there were some more products to go along with the CD. She wants her ""magic wand toothbrush"". Anyway, I highly recommend this CD if you have children!"
2,Nugarum contemptor,"Professor Deutsch has written a book for herself and the handful of high literary critics that dot major university campuses. Sentences like the following abound: ""As Helen Thompson has recently shown--in a brilliant reading of Walter Charleton's 1688 Hobbesian rendition of the matron story as a meditation on the materialist conception of the self and the infinite substitutability of the object of desire--romance is individuality's faceless antecedent and feminine ghost, monogamous teleological narrative's serial alternative.""Skip this effort and read or reread James Boswell's great book."
1,Not exactly an enjoyable read.......,"While the first half of this book is interesting and seemed to have possibilities, the second half is morose and disappointing. While I don't expect every book to be wrapped up happily with a red ribbon, this one left me feeling cheated. I waded through the second half, hoping upon hope that somehow the ending would make the rest of the book worthwhile. It did not."
1,"The horses die, so do the people - no point the whole thing","Barbara Dimmick clearly knows horses, and initially I enjoyed reading about the details of a horse trainer's life. However, her characters never feel real and there seems no point in the depressing death of the horses or the terrible way the book ends. When I finished the book I threw it across the room!"
1,in the presence of horses,"I am not sure why I finished this book, which was all about depressed people that wanted to die and dead people. The horses that suffered because of these self centred people should have been set free when Nat decided to up and leave them ""in charge"" of an owner that was sick and didn't care about them. This book was very boring whatever credit it has been given as being a good book is not so entirely deserved."
1,A miserable book,No horse lover would want to read this book--it's totally depressing. One star is more than it deserves.
4,Fascinating reading,"I am not a horse lover, but this book captured me from the start. I enjoyed every page of it, had trouble leaving it, and bonded with each character. I would recommend it to all who enjoy good fiction. To horse lovers I would think it to be a must. It is about relationships, love, committment and the courage it takes to proceed beyond the surface. Well written, and tugs at your heart."
4,"When the book jacket compells you, head to the register..","Waiting for a plane on the other side of the world I spotted IN THE PRESENCE OF HORSES. Having recently moved to Eastern PA, and with the possibility of working with horses in the near future, I was immediately taken by this book. Natalie's story is not unlike like that of many of us who have travelled, trying to find our way. Along with her we learn about life in a boarding stable and how teaching young girls to care for horses can teach us how to care for ourselves. With a somewhat mysterious air, we learn details of Natalie's past history and how it has shaped her psyche. With startling honesty it reveals how sometimes, circumtances totally out of our control help us find our way. This will tempt the reader to examine their own life decisions. I look forward to a possible sequel to learn more about the other characters we come to know in this story of one women's search to find her place among the people and animals who make up her world."
5,A horsewoman who loved this book...,"I have worked with horses on and off all my life. I grew up riding, having learned at the age of three from my beloved grandfather. I worked as a groom and trainer for some years. I can attest to the accuracy of life this author portrays within her novel. Even if you just look at the surface, it's a good book.But delve deeper and you find yourself involved in the private torments of a woman from whom life has taken much, and to whom little was given. The plotline is sad, yes. The horses, some of them, die, yes. This reflects real life. Horses that we dearly love, sometimes, horribly, die bad deaths, despite our efforts. This book does leave us with hope at the end, that despair can be overcome, that life brings with it the seeds of joy, that the spirit of one beloved horse can be sensed in the struggle to live of another small foal. Take a chance, try this story and see..."
2,"I can't say I enjoyed it, but I'm not sorry I read it.","The horse ascept of the story, mainly Part One, was very interesting. For those who enjoy horses and especially anyone who has had a horse as a part of their teen years will indentify with the bonding the main character, Nate, has with the unique horse, Twister. But after the moment of truth and the startling conclusion to Part One, the story is far too depressing. The theme of death is too heavy handed. Granted the issue of love and loss is important in all our lives. The theme seems to be encapsulated in Nate's eventual realization that, ""without a willingness to suffer, we keep nothing in our lives."" I would not recommend for troubled teens or anyone struggling with mental illness, specially depression, there simply is not enough hope or constructive responses to tragedy."
1,In The Presence of Horses,"Well what can I say, I totally agree with all you one star-ers. What I enjoyed most about this book was reading about the author's knowledge of horses.Anything else totally unenjoyable. I came to the conclusion that this book was about people that were miserable and completely content to remain so at the expense of those beautiful loving creatures, the ones that died needlessly, because there carer decided to go on a pilgrimage of doom and gloom. As if she needed to.You couldn't get a more depressing story."
2,In the Presence of Horses,"The first part of this book is wonderful. The author's knowledge of the horse is apparent. Then the book takes a grave turn for the worse. I was very dissappointed at the character who I initially hailed for her bravery & stamina, but then turns and runs away (again it seems) when life gets too tough for her. I about stopped reading the book. What happened to the theory: If you fall off - then get back on! The author has the opportunity to protray a wonderfully strong (woman) character along side a spiritual & magnificent animal. It's too bad she didn't."
2,Too depressing to be believable.,"This book disappoints. The characters are so miserable I found them unbelievable. Dimmick certainly knows horses, but it wasn't enough to hold the novel together."
2,"Luna, minus the magic","Luna is a great band in the studio. All of their studio albums are beautiful and I recommend them all. When it comes to playing live, hower, they just can't create the same magic that they do in the studio. Live, Dean Wareham always sounds to me like he is bored of the songs, and he doesn't isn't trying. And all of the guitars, which sound lustrious and smooth on the records, sound hollow and labored. Take, for example, ""Sideshow by the Seashore,"" a song that opens with one of the best guitar riffs ever. On the studio version, it is a mesmerizing riff ... live, it just sounds forced and thin. I've seen them live once, and I must say I was a little bored. I've seen Galaxie 500 live as well (opening for the Cocteau Twins) ... I think Galaxie 500 played a better show."
4,Luna Live,"I have seen Luna play live 4 times in three years. They are a great show. Sadly this live album does not, with a few exceptions, capture the audience or the aura of the shows they were recording from. Also, mostly the 'standard' songs are offered here. You can get the LP to hear 4 others songs. But there are no rare Luna songs presented here. I would say any Luna fan should buy a copy, and people who aren't sure about Luna should, too, but just don't expect anything earth shattering. Unfortunately these expectations fall short of the concert experience."
4,Good recipes,"This book has some pretty good recipes just like volume 1 does,it is good because all you need to make is 1 thing everything you need is in the one pot meal."
1,Too simple,I use cookbooks for inspiration. I found none in this book. Too Simple! I do not want to cook from this at all!
1,Too much sodium and carbs,The recipes are okay with a lot of meat recipes. It has too much sodium and carbs in the recipes for me. There is a section for Vegetarian recipes but they're not really vegetarian since there is chicken broth in it. The authors need to educate themselves about what is vegetarian and what isn't. I seldom use this book.
3,OK,My mom thought this was an okay gift. Doesn't like to be reminded she is diabetic. oh well at least she has a cookbook
4,Higher carb count,"this is ok but as someone else reviewed this, the carbohydrates are too high. This is one of the better recipe books. I'm finding there are so many books and information that lacks to organize the information good enough to be given 5 stars. Sometimes a little information can be more confusing than no information unless from one-on-one sessions with your Dr or specialized nutritionists."
5,One Pot Meals,I have tried 7 recipes as of yet and everyone of them are excellent. Everyone should have a copy of this book not just people with diabetes. Very healthy cooking!!!!!
3,"Strong beginning, [weak] ending.","Strong beginning, [weak] ending. This book starts as one of the best books ever written in the whole Black Library, WH40K universe. Its rich details, interesting plot and story line paint a picture of normal peoples living in WH40K universe trying to get about their life, not knowing anything of the great war in the universe. It reminds me of the Wheel of Time from Robert Jordan or those kinds of books, richly detailed and very ""human nature"".But the book takes a turn for the worst, the more it goes toward the end, it goes from innocence to damnation, from interesting to dark, from richly painted environment, to basic structure, even the story loses strength at the end, the last half of the book [is bad], but the beginning is so wonderful, if you don't mind the terrible ending, and you're curious about the agriculture world in WH40K, get it, if not you might want to pass on this one."
4,Better than it has any right to be.,"The black library is generally pulp fiction. It can be entertaining but generally can't be called ""good"". Rarely does it stick with you. This one is atypical in that respect. It still has some of the usualy WH40k blood and guts, but a surprising amount of intrigue and light philosophy as well. Asking basic questions about pre-destination and the nature of an ordered universe. Its hardly ground breaking, but it strange to find in a Warhammer 40k book of all places.The story follows around several characters in a primitive backwater, and how they are all ultimately being guided (un)knowingly towards very specific ends, hence the title ""Pawns of Chaos"".For those looking for the typical blood soaked warhammer romp, look elsewhere, you'll probably find this one boring. For those looking for something (a little) bit deeper but still mired in the fantastic (I am a fan after all) WH40k universe, I highly recommend this."
2,It was a Rough one....,"This book was a real rough one to finish. It seemed like a 100 meter sprint, run in molases. Not one of the Warhammer 40,000/Black Librarys best. If you are looking for the usual fast paced and exciting story that you find in books like ""First & the only"", ""Storm of Iron"" or ""Nightbringer"", you will be very disappointed."
2,My least favorite,"This was my least favorite Warhammer book so far. The action is all on a primitive planet which seems better suited for the WH fantasy series than WH40K sci-fi. The action is few and far between. The ending is very good, but doesn't make up for the rest of the book."
5,This book changed my life!,"I have fought depression my whole life and despite therapist after therapist, I never knew that I could find a roadmap for turning my life around. This book let me see the role I CHOOSE to take in my life. There are lots of things I allow to hold me back - issues from my past, what others have to say, things like that. This author struck me as someone who had faced tough issues and found a way out that not only helped her, but also helped others through her writing. I loved the stories about people and their issues. It helped me not feel alone. In addition, I didn't feel preachd to either. I've had enough of THOSE books. This isn't one. I felt like the author really knew me and was writing it just for me! Thanks so much."
5,Not Just For Bitter Women,"A great self-help book that lets readers see their behaviors through the stories of many who are trapped in some typical behavioral ""boxxes."" It's a quick read that left me smiling and crying and looking at myself differently by the time I'd finished. The boxx on workaholism looked all too familiar to me!"
3,Recorded in an echo chamber,"This is classic example of great performances ruined by technical aspects of the recording. The performances, what I heard, are excellent. But the recording venue is so acoustically bright and hence the reverberation so bad, that the end result is muddy and smeared, with Fischer's violin struggling to be heard above the din. At this point I haven't been able to listen to the whole thing. Performance: five stars. Recording: 0 stars. Very disappointing."
3,One boxer?,"I was somewhat disappointed by this product. You get one boxer, although the pic leads you to believe you might get two, three? Twenty bucks for one pair of boxers is pretty much a rip off. That said, they are really comfortable and they stay closed. I am just not going to buy this again unless they get a little cheaper."
2,DVD/VCR Combo,Recieved the unit and it does not live up to expectations. The Audio will quit after an extended use and the only way to get it back is to power down the unit and turn back on. It causes the TV to have waves that goes from dark to light. I am not happy with the unit.
4,corvette chair,The chair was just as described. I had to wait a bit too long for the product but it was during a very busy season. The company refunded a percentage for the delay.
4,Almost there....,"This book will help you prepare for the MCSD exam. Unlike all the other exams I took for my MCSD though, this book alone is not enough to pass the exam.As usual New Rider has excellent exam questions at the end of each chapter. The problem is the format of the exam itself, it is much easier if you are an experienced software developer. In my opinion this book can help you on this exam as much as any book, it's just that this exam is very thorough.To pass the exam, you probably want to read at least two other books. -->Software Project Survival Guide, Steve McConnell -->Any database design bookI saw some complaints about the practice exam, but I had no complaints. (a word of caution, the Microsoft Press study guide for this exam is HORRIBLE, it has almost no relevance to the exam)"
4,"Not perfect, but very good","The writing style of this book makes it very easy to work through. The author has a nice turn of phrase and an easy way of conveying information. The editing could have been better, especially in the data chapter, where you can tell they redid the example at least once during the editing process. On the whole I highly recommend this. I passed the exam very comfortably this morning, and give much credit to this book, the Exam Cram, and Transcender.If I was going to change something, it would be the Exam Gear software. That thing could definitely use some tweaking. Go with Transcender instead.Good luck!"
2,Out of touch and out of date,"I have to agree with one of my fellow reviewers - this book is way too technical and dry. With heavy, heavy chapters devoted to the development of the domain name system, trademark challenges, dispute case studies etc., The Domain Name Handbook reads more like a govenment manual than an istructive and entertaining piece of writing. Ten out of ten for so much research but not many out of ten for entertainment value, (and, yes, even an instruction manual can be enetertaining).... Theirwell-linked pages will take you some interesting routes to wherever the real knowledge lies.If you're a sucker for tables, lists, facts, data and specifics, this book with inform. If, like me, you prefer that learning should be fun, you'll find yourself in the wrong hands here. In any case, the book was published in mid 1998 and, with so much having happened on the Web, is in dire need of a revised update."
1,Way too Technical,This book is way too technical and dry. Domain Names for Dummies treats the subject matter in a much more enjoyable and business-oriented fashion.The user is left with little useful information and usable next steps.
4,Pretty good but this story isn't over yet,"A pretty good book overall. I know many of the people quoted in the book and it seems to portray things fairly for the most part. Some of the people interviewed for the book obviously have an agenda. Surprisingly, there are more characters portrayed in this book than in your average Oliver Stone movie.The book was rather long (sometimes less is more) but it is not bad considering it is the only book on Domain Names other than DNS & Bind - it is a good start. The authors will need to write a second book in another five years to tell us how the story ends."
4,Just what she needed,I purchased this night stand for my daughter's room. It's quite well-made and has stood up to a year of pretty heavy use with no discernable damage. It looks good and provides a lot of storage in a relatively small space.
2,Run for president?,"The content is written in an easy and simple style. The exercises are plentiful but sometimes repeat them self only to ask the same topic from a different angle. Nearly all the examples published are about presidents, or characters of world importance. As I do not want to run for presidency, specially not in the US, I could not relate too much to the examples. Of course the people mentioned have their greatness and have been all great leaders, but I am doing hard to relate them to myself. Therefore I got annoyed about the examples. I would have preferred to read some more handy examples about ""normal"" people, or even leaders in companies taking up their responsibility and become great leaders."
4,Purchase Review,"Thank you for prompt delivery. I actually ordered the book for my husband so I cannnot comment on the content of the book itself, but my experience making the purchase was wonderful. Thank you."
2,Little or no value,"I'm not sure that I received any value from this book. I was certainly annoyed by the authors' unrestrained endorsement of all things on the left side of the political spectrum (i.e. Obama, Gore, global warming, etc). There wasn't a lot of heavy thought put into the writing of this book, and the use of workbook-style questions for the reader seems to have been a device by the authors for adding content to an otherwise unoriginal collection of management clichés. I recommend reading a good biography of one of our nation's great leaders such as Lincoln or Washington if you want to get concrete examples of leadership principles."
2,A few good bits but mainly platitudes and banalities,"Trouble first appeared on the front cover. A silver haired gentleman staring resolutely into the future. My next door neighbour on the train commented ""he looks like a pompous ....head"".This was at it turned out. While it is actually quite short it seemed long because there was little that is not commonplace. I nearly fell asleep reading acres of mind numbing statements of the obvious.Give it a miss, there is much better out there."
2,ok,I received the book with a lot of writing and highlights in it that were not very clearly disclosed by the seller. Not very happy about it but will keep the book and try to use it like that but next time I will be more careful.
1,Don't bother......it doesn't work at all,"Did not work at all. I returned the same day I received it. I followed the instructions for use exactly and when I got it all set up, the radio static and interference is all I could here...I tried numerous stations.It is a crappy and cheap piece of equipment. Don't bother. If you want good sound, spend the money on a nice unit."
3,Save your money,"It's good as long as (many have mentioned this before) the airwaves in where you live aren't too overcrowded. I suggest you save your money and purchase a car stereo with an AUX input connection, or a stereo th`at will allow you to play your MP3 in a more direct manner."
1,Does not work...,"I recieved this product.. It worked for about 5 days.. Then, when i turn it on.. it works for about 10 seconds then goes out..I then was issued a replacement... then, the same problem happened to this one within 2 days...And now amazon will not give me a refund, even after i sent it in to them.. so i'm left empty handed and nothing to show for it...Do not buy..."
1,Repeated defects,"This product repeately turned itself off after 10 minutes or so. The tech support people were great and sent us a new one, but that unit had the exact same issue. We had to return it for good, assuming that it's a defect in all of the units."
4,Works Well.,"Good quality. Works well. Excellent price. In my area we have nearly no ""open"" stations so I went to a direct feed cable. Still use in vehicles or rental cars that do not have a 3.5mm ""in"" or usb ""in"". Out in the sticks where there are a lot of open frequencies it works fine.Update: As long as you do not live in a metro area like I do Chicago that has a lot of stations and little/no free channels. Does work fine in more rual areas. Actually have new vehicle with usb direct plug in so I'm passing it along to someone else in the family who can use it."
3,"It worked ok, but it broke after one year","I bought this FM transmitter with an Amazon.com gift card. I wanted to get a low cost transmitter so I wouldn't exceed my gift amount. This fit my cost criteria. It sounded alright most of the time. I did have trouble with it not recognizing that it was plugged into my cigarette lighter outlet. I would have to take it out and plug it in again. I also had trouble with it fuzzing out when I played a song that started slow and quiet-like it didn't recognize there was a song playing. About a month ago, I pulled it out and it fell apart into pieces. I lost some key parts to it in my car somewhere. I decided to put a new stereo in my car with a USB port for my Ipod. I should have just done that to begin with. I wouldn't waste my time with another FM transmitter."
4,Clear Sound and Good Range,"Here is a product that does as advertised and does it well. The sound is clear and I was somewhat surprised at the range that the Kensington has. I live in an urban area and after reading other reviews, I was concerned that I would have to make frequent adjustments to keep the signals from fading out and getting static. I was pleasantly surprised to find that after getting the correct frequency no other adjustments were necessary in my commute (over 25 miles and about an hour).Good product and simple to use."
2,An Almost Good Product,"I have had this Kensington FM transmitter for about 2 months and in my hands it has very acceptable sound and not alot of static.Unfortunately it has one fatal design flaw that makes listening to classical, jazz and any other type of music with any quiet passages VERY FRUSTRATING. During the quiet parts the unit will shut itself off causing my car audio to emit a ear piercing screech when it loses the signal. I haven't measured it but it seems like as little a 10-15 seconds of quiet causes this behavior.This makes this unit useless for classical music and quite a bit of jazz and other similar styles. If you listen to quiet music, avoid at all costs. If you don't it is the best transmitter I have tried.Sirandar"
5,Great FM Transmitter,Before I purchased this FM Transmitter I had an iPod with an iTrip that connected directly to the iPod. The iTrip would waste a lot of the battery and the reception in my 01 Ford Taurus was horrible. I had to constantly move the iPod around or just hold it to get a decent reception. I finally bought this transmitter and it's great. I don't have to move the iPod around and the batter life is so much better now because the transmitter uses the power from the cigarette lighter. The reception is great. There has been times when it's transmitted a clear signal over some of the local radio station. I would highly recommend this product for anyone who wants to transmit there music from any mp3 player through there car radio.
4,rather nice,"With the Kensington FM Transmitter...I like that there is no need for batteries. The presets are nice too. Sound quality is definitely good - only issue would be in the cities, having to adjust the stations to find one with no interference. In the St. Paul / especially Minneapolis areas it can be a little bit of a hassle to deal with...so you'll have to examine where there is no interference in your major cities basically."
3,"Works from batteries, but that's it","The shipping time was satisfactory, and the functionality of this is great, but it will only work well on batteries. Noise is produced from 12V wall packs. My function for it is to transmit radio throughout the house and be powered from the wall outlet, but a 60 Hz hum is produced from the rectified DC. Not even an inline 12VDC battery filters the 60 Hz noise from the power pack. Also, when running on the car battery the audio gave off a constant high-pitched squeal. I haven't researched it much but this is what I've come up with so far.Edit: Okay...so about a 1.5 years later, I think I've figured out the noise problems. PROPER GROUNDING. All the following must be grounded: 120VAC/12VDC transformer input, transformer negative or ground output to a ground plane, and the audio plug automatically grounds through your computer, Walkman or iPod."
2,"No good in Atlanta, either","I drive a 2004 VW Phaeton, which has neither a cassette player nor an MP3 jack, so a transmitter is the only way I can get songs out of my Zune and into my car. I have a Pioneer Inno XM receiver/transmitter which does a really good job, even in this urban market. The Kensington transmitter does a poor job, so I can't simply blame the crowded airwaves. This unit simply lacks the chops to get the job done."
1,what a waste of money,"I bought this product to use with my Walkman MP3 player. It worked all of twice. Now, when I plug it in to my cigarette lighter, auxilliary jack, it makes a loud tone and turns itself off. So I learned a $35 lesson. I was going to buy a pricier transmitter and thought I would save myself some money because I trusted the other reviews. I would definitely pass this item up and fork out the bucks for something with a more trusted name. By the way, I wouldn't have given it any stars but the site forced me to give it one."
4,A very good product.,I have been using the Kensington Universal FM Transmitter to listen to audio books from my MP3 Player over the car radio. It works very well with crystal-clear sound the great majority of the time. There is occasionally some very faint static but it lasts for only a brief time and I have no trouble hearing the audio over it. I have been very pleased with the quality of this product.
5,"great product, great service from Amazon","I bought this to improve the less than desirable audible signal level from my Garmin Nuvi 360. For a rather pricey, but otherwise very good instrument, that is its one significant flaw.The first unit was DOA. I filled out the on-line return form and poof! I was responded to immediately that a new one was on its way & a pre-paid shipping label was on-line for me to print out.I was amazed and very pleased with Amazon. The replacement unit arrived a couple of days later and it worked perfectly. Kudos to Amazon."
3,Still evaluating,"Transmitter worked fine for about a week - no problem finding stations to use, a little static sometimes but not bad. Then it started turning offafter about 30 seconds for no reason. I contacted the company and they immediately shipped me a new one - just tried it once and it's fine so far."
3,good purchase for me,"I am happy with this purchase. I live in a city of about 100,000 and it works fine for me. If it gets staticy I just find another channel. Good price for a good product."
4,"Good product, Bad city.",The product is fine. Its great. However I live in a city and with all the radio stations bouncing around its a bummer listening to static through my music all the time. This isnt the fault of the device. Its just how it goes. If you live in the country youre totally set with one of these babies.
3,Just don't open the package,"I purchased this product as a prop for a high school play that included a ship's captain with a parrot on his shoulder. The parrot looked great in the package, but the minute I took it out, one of the eyes fell off. OK, so a little glue and it was stuck back on, but then before we even used it once, the tail feathers fell off. And before I could get them glued on, the other eye fell off. I also found the product to be a bit stingy with the feathers, barely covering the styrofoam form.I would not recomment this as a toy, but once all glued together, I have to say that it looked great as a stage prop and got lots of laughs from the audience when our ship's captain ""talked"" to it. I just didn't expect to have to repair it right out of the bag!"
1,"A Parrot on Yer' Shoulder, Not this One.","I bought this for my four year old. I wanted it because it showed that it could be attached to the shoulder. Unfortunately, the parrot cannot be attached, at least not in a perched position. It came with two elastic ribbons super glued to the parrot's claws. I guess it's supposed to be tied somehow. Not sure how the producers figured it would work. If you just need a prop parrot, this works, but as a toy for a kid, it fails."
1,Husqvarna 137,I used to have a Husqvarna Rancher but it died after many years of use. I decided I didn't need such a large saw so I bought the Husqvarna 137. All I can say is this saw is not worth the money. It starts fairly easily but after a few cuts it chokes out and is impossible to start until it's cold. For the short amount of time it's running I have no problem downing 12 standing dead trees and cutting them to firewood length but I'm lucky if I can get 15 minutes of work out of the saw for every hour in the forest.I'm now looking at Stihl or another brand as this Husqy has given me a really bad experience.
3,calibration disc,"does not seem as easy as expected, you need to have some AV experienceBut I was able to use it some"
3,Just OK,"Either I was confused and didnt read the directions clearly, but I didnt think it did all that much for the adjustment for my Pioneer Plasma Kuro."
5,"Great calibration tool, PS3 users read this","I haven't tried any other calibration DVD's or Blu's, so I can't compare it to what else is out there on the market, but this disc really helped me with my TV. I haven't done the audio setup yet because I don't have a sound system, but the video tests are great and fairly easy to use.Important note for anyone using a PS3 to play this disc: Make sure you turn SuperWhite and Full RGB on in your PS3 System Settings, or else some of these tests won't work. It's impossible to do even the Basic Contrast test without SuperWhite turned on."
5,Worth EVERY Penny,"I used this item to adjust 3 Plasma TV's. I thought I had all 3 TV's adjusted pretty good before using this item. After using the WOW disc, all 3 TV's looked a LOT better. This will not be as good as hiring a certified person to caibrate your TV, but the nice thing with this is that it costs a lot less money, works on more than one TV, and really does what it is supposed to do. The average person can adjust and improve the viewing experience of their TV.Would HIGHLY RECOMMEND.Would purchase again.A great product."
4,Good but not great if you just want a simple calibration tool,Good but not amazing ... It definitely works but was overly complex and takes a long time to fully calibrate a TV. I also felt that it was too influenced by already existing TV settings.
4,Disney WOW bluray,"This bluray is zone free. No problem on my Pioneer BDP-LX55 Zone 2I used it to calibrate my Kuro 50"".It is very useful, but don't replace a professional calibrage.The result is too much colored for SD TV (too much orange on faces)But very good for HD TV or movies"
2,WOW vs.S&M,"I am another member of AVS forums that recently gave the WOW disc a spin.My equipment consists of a LG 55""LHX feed directly with HDMI by aSONY BDP-S1000ES Blu-Ray player. Not my normal set up but for this test only.My results are not the same as BROWNES but not that far off that you can see there is a problem. These are the results I got using the LCD mode on the disc:Basic Brightness 57Contrast 84Advanced: Brightness 63Contrast 90Then I did it again as suggested in it instructionsAdvanced: Brightness 60Contrast 92Then I switched to the S&M; discBrightness 51Contrast 77The results from the S&M; disc are to me more pleasing.Iam not putting down this product, just does not seem to work well with mysetup.My next step is to try using the plasma mode for the test.I will report the results if there is any change.The results from the WOW disc seem to bright in my well lit room.My set has not been calibrated and the disc was tested in the factory THX mode."
3,check it,"You know what? Just turn the local news on and adjust your TV settings until it looks good to you. Seriously, man."
2,I couldn't figure out how to use it!,"It just didn't do much for my TV. Maybe it's just me, but it was a waste of my money."
5,World of Wonder Blu-ray,"A neat DVD that makes understanding how to adjust the various settings on your TV simple and effective. I'm not a professional at this sort of thing but I feel that it helped. In addition there are bonus features which explain many aspects of how high definition works, and cut scenes from Disney movies to show the capability of your system once it is set up."
5,Works Fine,Works as advertised. Very easy to follow the instructions. Loved the intro provided by Goofy prior to the science lesson concerning how picture and sound is with your TV
4,doesn't work properly for all Sony HDTV/Blueray setups,"I was very happy to find this product and received it last week. I have a Sony 46"" LED TV and a Sony Blu-ray player connected via HDMI (v.1.4) with active-sync or whatever it's called) I started with the easy setup and discovered my current contrast and brightness settings were spot-on. Then I moved on to the aspect ratio setup and it was there I discovered that it isn't possible to adjust the aspect ratio with the current setup- it is fixed with that setup (about 1/4"" over-scale) and can't be modified. This isn't the fault of the WOW disc but annoying that i couldn't use the disc to fix it."
2,More complex than advertised,I didn't find any changes that were worthwhile using the included materials. Either my settings were perfect or the poor documentation had me not using the material properly. Not well written to efficiently implement. Clunky and extra Disney hype is totally unnecessary and unhelpful in a quest to essentially advertise Disney. What else could be the point to that extraneous material?
4,"Decent product, check out your tv picture FIRST to see if its needed","I recently purchased a Panasonic plasma tv. I was excited to get the best picture possible and ordered the Disney WOW blu-ray to go with it; It turns out it was useless for me since the tv came perfectly calibrated and no changes were needed. This is not WOW fault though and the features this product did include are easy and effective enough for anyone to be able to use. I recommend this product if you aren't happy with the current picture quality of your tv, otherwise it's pointless."
2,Pretty basic,"Pretty basic setup stuff, the TV's default settings were pretty much teh same as the disk suggested. It might be good for an older TV, I bought my TV in November"
2,Not Wowed...,So I bought into all the great reviews this product has received and I have to say I'm completely disappointed. The disc is very tedious and drawn out way more than it needs to be. You have to watch the instructions for each calibration but they are so long and in depth it's ridiculous. I would much prefer simple concise instructions. Futherrmore this disc did not make a noticeable difference in my picture. I have a Sony Bravia TV and the Standard picture setting is very good. I found that using this disc to calibrate the cinema setting didn't not improve upon the standard setting for my TV. Also it was difficult to calibrate this setting because my TV doesn't have a moving bar contrast adjustment. I was definitely not wowed.
5,Must have,This DVD is a must have for High Definition tvs. We have calibrated all of our tvs with this for unbelievable pictures.
3,fair,"expected something a little more technical. seems meant for the layman and has mostly advertising for Disney.did not ""wow"" me!"
5,A Wow calibration,I'm not gonna sit here and explain everything. All I can say is its worth the $30 just for the time and aggravation you will spend trying to do it yourself. Results are astonishing. Just go out and get this disc now.
5,Works Great.,For the price it does a fantastic job especially compared to the cost of having a professional calibrate the television. I would buy the blue ray disc again.
4,Easy to use; can be done in an hour,Easy to use and understand. Could calibrate using only my TV's remote. Did not need to enter TV's service menu. Picture looks awesome after calibration. Started with the easy setting and moved to advance settings with no problem. I have no TV calibration experience and was able to calibrate my TV with the included instruction booklet.The DVD shows you how to perform each step before going to the calibration step which made everything easy.
4,Works Great! Worth the time and small amount of $$$,"I had my system calibrated by a professional with the other 2 main companies. I forgot the names, but one was a DVD and the other Blu-Ray. He did a great job and loved it. I purchased this one cause it was newer and I had other TV's i wanted to calibrate. After running the first few tests, I realized that my new 2011 Plasma was under utilized. I ran the test and calibrated it to the WOW and noticed a dramatic increase in color, brightness, shades of black. 2 people wearing different black suits next to each other with shadows, PERFECT!I highly recommend this for anyone with a Blu Ray player and/or a 7.1 receiver.The experience, or test clips to see how good your calibration was, were BORING and not worth watching.Must do: Brightness, Color, Contrast, and Gamma. =VideoMust do: Phase Test and sound check using the sound meter =Audio"
3,Good for basic adjustments,"After getting a decent picture on my new TV, I still wanted more. So, I bought the Disney WOW disc. I found the disc easy to use, with good navigation. It goes through all the basic TV settings: brightness, contrast, color, tint, sharpness and scaling. It also goes through audio settings, which I didn't use. Since I already made some adjustments on my own, it wasn't that helpful. I found it good for 2 reasons: 1) The disc comes with a blue filter, to help you adjust the color/tint. 2) It also helped me with scaling. I had it set on 16:9. After a few tests, I changed it to ""Just Scan"". This provided more picture on the screen, and slightly more detail. Unfortunately, this was not enough for me to keep the disc. If you haven't done any tweaking to your TV, I would recommend it."
4,"Good calibrator, but not necessary...","Disney Wow was easy to use, although it took hours to get through. It did calibrate my television beautifully. However, after calibrating I did a quick internet search to compare the optimal calibrations for my particular TV. What did I find? The exact same calibrations listed on multiple websites. In fact, I found optimal calibrations for a multitude of viewing situations.Moral of the Story: Don't spend $30-something on a calibration disc if you can find the calibration settings online."
3,Not as in depth as I expected,Not overly impressed. When completed my TV settings were almost identical to how I had them from the get go. It is great at showing things that you cannot adjust. I was expecting more.
3,Not really needed,"Im sure it works fine for what it is but as it was not needed I gave it 3 stars. I returned the disk unopened and unused because it wasnt needed. I simply went to C-Net and used their settings for both my new Panasonic 65VT50 and Samsung 43E450 and they look great, much better than default setting and better than the THX modes on the Panasonic. Couldnt justify the time and expense of using this disk so I returned to amazon. ."
1,Ended Up Just Doing It Myself,"Everyone's TV is different. There are different brands, models, and manufactures. Once I realized that I couldn't help but feel a bit cheated. After spending 25$ for this I was angry that I had to sit there for a good hour and calibrate the whole entire thing by myself with no help at all. In the end, I ended up going by what I liked and saw, and it had nothing to do with what this told me. Very Disappointed!"
3,haven't finished yet,"Tried this out the first night I received it. An hour and 3 cups of rum and coke later, I can't find it. Guess I'll update my review when it turns up."
3,Not all that helpful,I was disappointed with this product. I mostly used the Beginner Tests but several of the Advanced Tests that I used were the same as the Beginner. The color tests are very subjective. The contrast and brightness tests are useful but did not change the settings that I'd arrived at on my own. The aspect ratio set up was the only thing that I found helpful and it quickly resolved aspect issues that I'd had. Once I had my settings I still needed to tweek them further after viewing the picture for a while.
2,Disney WOW Blu-ray Review Update,"Purchased the OPPO 93 after being told the WOW disk should be used in conjunction with a reference standard Blu-ray player. Still a difference between a Basic Calibration and an Advanced - the Advanced calibration results for Brightness and Contrast are WRONG - they're too high! Was then told my sets need a Pro calibrator to calibrate my sets. The ISF Pro Calibrator was in, my sets calibrated, and now the defect is even more pronounced! Was also told that there are 3 defects on the disk, they're to be corrected, and a New Disk Issued. So, if you're using the Disney WOW Disk for calibrating your set, stick to the Basic Brightness and Contrast for your settings."
5,By Far My Favorite Calibration Disc.,"Well though out and produced this calibration disc is a must for anyone with a new TV or bluray player.I also own the latestSpears & Munsil High-Definition Benchmark Blu-ray Disc Edition [Blu-ray], but compared to the Disney WOW Calibration Disc - it seems out of data and lacking in usability.I got a much better calibration from the Disney WOW Disc than I did from the Spears and Munsil.That said, I still recommend both and think its worth owning both as supplements to each other.But if I had to pick just one it would be the Disney WOW Calibration Disc hands down!Disney did a great job including descriptions and great step by step tutorials throughout the disc.From beginners to experts - this disc includes all you need to get your TV preforming at its best!"
5,Great Blu-Ray,This is a good Blu-Ray for calibrating your TV or projector. It ended up not being useful to me though because all of my things were at the optimal settings out of the box.
2,Not WOW for me!,"I must say that when I read the reviews, I was inspired to purchase this item. Not so now. Save your money and find your recommended settings on Cnet, etc. When going from one subject to another, good luck. Tried about 6 times before I could figure it out and I am very computer and DVD savy. You would think that they would have written information on the disk or on screen. Duh! Anyway, went to a bonafied review and did what they said and am happy with results. Wasted my money!"
2,Not good for rear projection it seems,"I purchased a 73 inch Mitsubishi (WD73640) and bought this disk with the idea of calibrating it myself.The first 3 calibrations didn't work very well as the instructions said to increase/decrease the setting until something appeared/disappeared.Well, this thing wasn't there at any setting, so could not tell.Going to try the advanced calibrations, but not holding my breath."
3,- Underwhelmed,"Well, I bought the disc and ran it. The new monitor, a 60"" Viera by Panasonic was pretty much 'bang on' ..right outta the box. As for Goofy, the host.. ""YUP.. I felt just like him"" having bought this disc.OK,I suppose, for real 'newbies', but for an adult... This would be a 'one-timer' for viewing IMHO."
3,Basic,"This disc does what older calibration DVDs do. The tests are few, and none are new, more advanced, or represent any great enhancement. It's not bad; it's just really overpriced."
4,Great for a novice like me.,"All I can say is it worked fine for me. I now get great whites and blacks now. I have a Mitsubishi 73"" DLP. It took a good bit of time to get things set up right but well worth the time.Also used it for my 42"" plasma. Next I will do the 20"" LCD in our motorhome.For the price I am very satisfied. I wish it came with more color filters other than blue, that's my only complaint."
5,Easy to use,Easy to use and calibrates screen perfectly. I am not skilled at electronics and this was a breeze for me! Definitely recommend!
4,Worked well enough,I purchased the product to help calibrate my new tv. I think it made an improvement as far as I know.
5,This is it!,I read about the WOW Home Entertainment calibration system on HDGURU.com and was very interested. I went to Amazon.com to read reviews; I was truly impressed. Since I had a preconceived idea of Disney products it was a little difficult believe that this was for grown ups. WOW is amazing! From the opening scenes to the very easy calibration on to the snippets of Disney movies it is truly a professional tool. I started to calibrate at the beginner level but started to need more. Soon I was calibrating at the advanced/expert level. Terrific product.
3,"Cute, family friendly, a bit ridiculous.","This is a fun family movie, not much more.Four teens join in a quest to find the legendary ""Robbers Roost"" (the hide out for Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch). That wouldn't have been so bad, in fact that was the fun part (think Young Indiana Jones). But the redemption of Butch Cassidy part was a bit strained.But you can judge for yourself."
2,Overkill,"I recently took the CBEST exam, and I agree with the previous reviewer. This book amounts to overkill. I subsequently bought ""CBEST"" from Learning Express, and immediately found it better organized and much more concise. After completing the CBEST, I can also attest that the Learning Express book is much more representative of what you'll see on the actual exam. (If you're like me and do most of your writing on a keyboard, practice writing some essays in pencil before tackling the CBEST.) Good luck!"
1,This guide does not reflect questions on the actual test.,"I wasted a great deal of time and energy studying the extremely detailed algebra and geometry concepts that this book claims is on the CBEST. The most valuable guide for studying is found in the CBEST booklet which outlines what is really found on the test. However, if you do want to brush up on skills I recommend ""CBEST"" by Learning Express also sold through Amazon."
4,Good book certainly but not exciting,I am using this book as supplement for the Building Internet Applications I and II study guide by Christopher Allen. I bought this with the intent to get some information on report not covered well in the book. This book certainly has the information I wanted. This book may be written for a beginers. The book has useful information but overall I was not excited about the book. But I still give 4 stars for the contents.....
3,"Soul Hits of the '70s: Didn't it Blow Your Mind, Vol 6","Good product, on the whole. However, I think the selection could have been much better. Best part of product were the CD covers."
5,Great nutritious recipes and info on disease fighting foods,"This book helps to give you a start in incorporating specific, known anti-cancer foods into your daily diet. The foods are family-friendly and the dishes have drawn rave reviews from unsuspecting ""tofu-haters"". I especially like the section ""Top Ten Super Foods"" that outlines ten particular foods that are essential in a cancer-fighter's diet. This book has been a great addition to my arsenal in my 9 year old daughter's fight against cancer. If you comprehend the link between cancer and nutrition, this book will give you tools to increase your body's ability to effectively fight cancer. I highly recommend it!"
3,Too Bad,"This was a ""ground breaking"" book in 1968. The ""Second Printing"" contained an excellent Preface in 1972 with headings like: ""Running To Stand Still"", ""The New Horizons in Sexual Behavior: Its Emerging Autonomy"" and ""What About Marriage? A Real Pluralism?"" It is a shame that those who chose to reissue this text did not select the version with the additional Preface showing what changes the authors were observing over a space as brief as four years! Search for the later, out of print version. The few extra pages are worth the effort."
4,Would like a meter to know the batteries are charged.,"Most people reviewed this by saying it does what you want it to. That is true - I bought this with two sets of AAA rechargeable batteries for a baby monitor, and it feels great not having to buy new batteries every few weeks. I do wish this charger had a meter to let me know when the batteries in question are fully charged - I just remove the batteries when I need them (every four or five days), and they last. Overall, a good buy."
4,Easy use charger,Have used this unit for several months. Used for AA & AAA Alkaline cells. Only one leaked & one did not charge. Recycled 80% for 1st recharge.
3,not bad,"Would have given a five except that you have to charge 4 at a time and you cannot charge C-batteries in the D-slot while charging A-batteries in the A-slot, because the A-slot is used for C-batteries instead of the D-slot."
4,Solar is not quick,"There is not way to check whether the battery is charged or not on this machine. However, it did work. I left it in direct sun all day. The D cells that I charged lasted only overnight on a fan."
2,Only will charge....If!!!!!,You have to have 4 similar batteries in...at same time to allow charging...Did not charge the 4 AA batteries I installed very well
4,4 battery charger,"I suppose it's charging' but there isn't any indicator or light that shows it's working. Otherwise, it saves energy by using clean energy to get the job done."
1,Useless for charging cellphones,"The item description clearly says it charges cellphones, but unless they are living in a 10 year old time warp, there's no way it does.No adaptor for either microUSB or apple devices.Don't buy this unless you only need to charge batteries."
4,FAST SHIPPING.,Looks great. The plug in charger is for very basic items. May Not work on a cell phone. Packaged well.
2,Deceptive advertising!!,"First, seller advertises that this is Kwikset MAXIMUM Security Brand. It is not. It is Kwikset Security (at least Kwikset Security was the brand I received.) There is a big difference because you can buy Kwikset Security for less at Lowes or Home Depot and you don't have to wait a week for your combo pack. Second, the product description says ""Meets ANSI/BHMA Grade 1 Security with a 10 year Mechanical and 5 year Finish Warranty."" However, the package clearly indicates only Grade 3. Another big difference. These are the differences I have found so far. In consequence, Kwikset is a great brand, but beware that you are not buying the better Kwikset Maximum Security brand. You are buying the lesser brand of Kwikset Security."
3,OK,Stands up fairly well but the number of brochures one can fit is very limited. And it will tip over if full.
2,"If it's too good to be true, it usually is!","While unable to access supplement facts and dosage on this product, the LOW PRICE prompted me to give it a try. The amount of lutein/zeaxanthin, combined, for two tablets is only 4mg! The prescribed and recommended dosage is 10mg of Lutein and 2mg of zeaxanthin daily. Will never buy another product from ""No Comparison!"""
2,i think my vision was worse after these,"maybe it was just my imagination, but things looked a bit blurry the day after and so i haven't taken any since then."
5,An Unexpected Surpise!,"Being an avid shoujo reader, I tend to try many different kinds of Shoujo. However, this one did not seem to appeal to me. But, many people recommended it to me so I decided to try it out. I was so amazed by the artwork, it's so completely beautiful. The story itself is cute, heartwarming, interesting, and amazingly realistic.If any of the following manga interest you, you will most likely enjoy Tramps Like Us very much: Hot Gimmick, Marmalade Boy, Mars, Kare First Love, INVU and so on.I highly recommend you try this series!"
1,Squicky age difference...,"TLU was recommended to me, after asking for a manga featuring adult characters. This looked promising and romantic and nowhere in the plot synopsis does it mention the fact that the heroine is 27 and the guy she picks up and rescues from the street isn't an adult. He is 15. Erk. I have to pass on this one. It made me uncomfortable. I wish the plot synopsis or other reviewers had mentioned this detail."
3,A Bit Dm,"This flashlight is not as good as it is advertised for the red beam function. The red beam is extremely endemic even when the thumbwheel is scrolled to its brightest setting, so this makes it almost useless for taking notes or reading a star atlas without losing your dark vision adaptation. The white light beam is quite bright but this defeats the purpose of having the red beam light. I would recommend Orion RedBeam SP Self-Powered LED Flashlight instead."
1,Disappointing,"Even at its highest setting, the beam is not really bright enough to be useful. On the other hand, it will absolutely never interfere with your night vision."
5,Presents some eye-opening arguments,"Just in time for the November elections arrives Ted Rall's satire/graphic novel Generalissimo El Busho, providing a 'tragicomic chronicle' of the administration's follies and crimes by an editorial cartoonist with a long history of Bush criticism. Rall has been a longtime critic of the President and is the author of two other alternative cartooning titles: Generalissimo El Busho presents some eye-opening arguments and impassioned statements."
2,Cheap scope gives cheap results,"My review is for the Rbh62442v 6-24x42. The desciption given for this model by Amazon is incorrect, as it is for the 3-9 scope.I compared this scope to several other scopes I own and have to say that I was disapointed. Compared to even less expensive scopes like my Tasco, this scope just did not stand up to be counted! I had high hopes for this scope, and was delighted when I found a good deal on it. I paid $50The light gathering ability is where I found this scope to suffer. While looking at a dark rough surfaced tree trunk at 100 yard with little light, the Optronics #RBH62442V did not let me define any real detail. My Tasco scope showed more detail, even as it got darker out.Since most of my hunting is done in less than perfect conditions, I guess I will still be looking for a better scope!"
5,The Ongoing Moment,"This book may be more meaningful for the reader with some knowlege in the field. It's coversational tone and references to photographersand their works already familiar to the reader promotes a feeling of intimacy.I found the author's views on photography interesting. His views on theworks of well-known photographers,their similar subjects and their personal approaches to these like subjects proved illuminating as well."
3,"Some good stuff, but not best shorts collection","Sling Blade -- if you like the feature, you'll probably like the short.Baraka -- beautiful images, this is not what you are usually hoping for in a short, that is, something simple but clever. The production values in this are outstanding, it is not a narrative, and I suspect the feature is best seen on a big, big screen, say IMAX.Black Rider -- probably my favorite short on here.Mr. Resistor -- a fun diversionHenry Rollins -- I imagine the performer's fans will love this, probably not too appealing to most others.Overall the DVD is varied with some interesting material, but not my favorite."
4,best probiotic I have tried,"I agree with previous reviewers. It's best to eliminate sugar from the diet to achieve optimal results. It's amazing to see how attached the body is to sugar when a simple detachment is so difficult. In conjunction with sugar elimination, this product has provided the best results for yeast, fungus, and mold relief among the many reputable brands I have tried over the years. Can't give it 5 stars because relief was not 100%. I am alternating every 30 days with FiveLac which is filling in the gaps. Also, I took a few homeopathic products to quicken the detox process - 1) Molecular Biologics Fungisode, 2) Bioallers Yeast, Dust, Mold, and 3) Natrabio Candida Yeast. Finally, to help with the sugar cravings I substituted SweetLeaf stevia for sugar. I noticed that combining the stevia with ThreeLac made for more effective results."
4,"It does work, but just give it some time!","I have been looking for answers for months for my health concerns. I had suspected candida, so I did a candida diet and took some anti-fungals and I felt alright, but not 100%. I did a lot of blood tests and did find out that I have low ferritin, but the iron supplements have not been helping, and I suspect it's caused by the candida. I didn't realize how much it was really working until I ran out, so I ordered two more boxes. I've kind of hit a plateua, so I am going to increase the amount...there's a good article [...] on how to use Threelac effectively. I'm also taking some acidophilus, B-12,adrenal and thyroid support and some supplements that help clean out parasites, which seem to go hand in hand with the candida. I feel much better, not entirely back to normal yet, but it takes time- there are no overnight miracles. Give it a try, and just keep at it, because you will notice a difference."
5,ThreeLac is helpful for yeast,I have been using ThreeLac to fight yeast in my intestines for about 6 months. I am using 4 packs a day now. It is very helpful and I do recommend using it if you are having stomach problems.
3,"feel better after taking it, but still have problems","the first day i took it i felt better ,my head cleared up and i felt i could discontinue the diet i was on,but this product isn't a miracle worker. dieting ,excercise,and threelac is the only way to get better. i am still not recovered from candida and i have been taking this for 2 months, however i feel better than i would have"
3,A little overhyped,"I suffered from what I believe was a chronic yeast overgrowth. My Kaiser docs were less than useless in diagnosing the problem. After multiple diabetes, B12 deficiency, CBC and more tests that were all negative, I decided to take matters into my hands by trying ThreeLac. While I can't say that all my problems disappeared overnight, they reduced in intensity fairly quickly and after 4 months using ThreeLac (1 - 3 doses a day depending on intensity of symptoms) I can say that I am back to 80% health. It took a lot more time and money than what other reviewers have claimed but it is the one product that has seemed to do some temporary good. I also combined this with a greatly sugar reduced diet from the book ""Feast without Yeast"" to achieve results. Still this isn't a cure for my symptoms."
1,Big Hype!!!!!,"I used this product for a few months and at first I was feeling really good, but after the month wore off I had to take more and more and it seemed like a constant expensive circleI did take the advice of one of your reviewers and went to the health food store and bought a good probiotic and that made a world of difference and I did save a lot of money and got much better results"
3,Too soon to tell but can see a bit of improvement,"This product needs at least three months for a fair review. So far, I'd like to think that it has helped me with digestion, etc. I've read many positive reviews here so I'm hoping to be one more."
2,I didn't see any improvement,I took 3 packages per day for 1 month. So far I didn't feel any improvement. This probiotic is easy to take and has good taste.
1,"enterococcus faecalis in it, avoid unless you want prostatits/urinary tract infection","So ya I bought this product to help with my stomach yeast problem but ended up getting a prostate infection from it. enterococcus faecalis is a very nasty organism that is opportunistic. It is very hardy and can live outside the body for months, it also freely trades genes with other bacteria that are beneficial to it. Which allows it to aquire virulence even though the company claims the strain used isn't pathenogenic it can aquire genes for this from other bacteria. I am now on bactrim to try and get rid of it from my prostate.avoid unless you want to suffer like me."
3,??,"These reviews are EXTREMELY suspicious, consider that many of the people that rate this with 5 stars have not reviewed ANY other products on Amazon. Am I the only one here that thinks that these people may have been put up to this?Nonetheless- I have ordered the product and will try it for myself."
3,A Good Deal Gone Bad,"I searched the internet trying to find a good deal on Threelac because I already got ripped off by the so called ""National Autism Association"" when I ordered Threelac from them. Twice I ordered two boxes and twice they only sent me one and refused to even awknowledge their mistake. Now I thought I finally found a good deal on Amazon.com and the very next time I try to order they jack the price up to $65. I can get it for that price anywhere. As for the product, I'm still checking it out. It appears to be helping, but I want to continue taking it for further testing, if I can find another good deal."
4,I hate the fact that this stuff is so expensive...,"...and that it's the only thing that seems to work! At least for me. I've use quite a few probiotics but usually you have to take on an empty stomach, at a certain time, etc. But I like that it doesn't matter when you take this product, before eating, while eating, after eating - it always seems to work. And I can see results in a matter of days by looking at my tongue. I would give it 5 starts but the price stops me short of that. There's no reason this product needs to be priced that high. I would probably buy more frequently if it wasn't for that.."
1,SCAM!!!!! DONT BUY THIS CRAP!,"Absolutely terrible product! WAY TOO OVERPRICED, doesnt even work. I contains ingredients that the human body shouldnt even consume, SMH!!! i am so disappointed with myself that i wasted 50 dollars on such bs. i should have done my research first. whoever created this product is so heartless. they are trying to scam people who have problems with excessive candida in their bodies. they know that candida sufferers will try anything to get rid of this terrible bacteria and just feel normal and healthy for once, that they advertise that this product will do just that, and overprice i cuz they KNOW people will do anything to get better...but yet, IT DOESNT EVEN WORK. I WANNA CRY, LIKE SMH!!!!!!!!"
1,Not Useful Waste of Money,I bought this product on a recommendation I read in a best selling book. I didn't benefit from this product and will not recommend it to anyone. I switched to Pearl Probiotics and Activ Dannon yogurt/cheese which I find as very effective and cheap.
2,Threelac,The purpose of purchasing Threelac is because we are trying to get rid of a yeast condition in our bodies.I think Threelack is product that contains far too much sugar in its formula therefore making it difficult to get rid of the yeast since yeast feeds itself on sugar.
3,Hmm... not bad?,The supplement is easy to take - and it does have a hint of a lemon flavor. I am finding it hard to remember to take it daily... so it is too soon for me to say whether or not it is helping me. But I had read a lot of good reviews on this item on the web. I would say that it is worth a try. I am wanting to give it a go for several months before deciding the results.
5,Very satisfied with purchase,I was very satisfied with this purchase. It came very quickly in the mail and was packaged very nice.Thanks again for a great order !!
5,great product!,My husband suspects he has a systemic yeast infection- with toe nail fungus and other symptoms. Within minutes of taking this product he can notice a difference in his muscular response. Wonderful product!
4,Good stuff!,"By the 3rd day I noticed a difference in my digestion and bowel function. I was able to digest foods I had been forced to avoid in the past, namely dairy products. Great product!"
1,Save your $$$$,Threelac is very expensive for the amount that you get and is not a strong probiotic blend.Best bet is to go to your health food store/or online and look for a good probiotic blend that is not only less expensive but stronger than Threelac
2,Take a look at the ingredients,"Took this product for a few years with good results, but I noticed it's effectiveness declined.Recently the product went through a labeling change. If you look at the product contents, vitamins are listed with quantities, but the beneficial probiotic quantities are not. They list them under a ""proprietary blend"". This allows them to put whatever they want into the product without disclosing specifics. I question product integrity highly when I see this.I recently switched to trying other products and I found 2 reputable brands that I will alternate in usage. I just made the change so I can't report on the effectiveness of the change."
2,not as expected,"I read awesome reviews on this product and was eager to try it! I recently finished my second box and the truth is I cannot see much difference. Still facing discharge and itching, even going trough a sugar-free diet and having so much care avoiding processed food etc...I would like to know if there's really a cure for this awful decease that can create so much disturb in our lives! Antibiotics are sometimes unavoidable and yeast just takes advantage and remains in your body forever!"
3,better than most,mixes easily with most beverages with little taste difference. works fast and better than most
1,Save some $$$$$,Threelac is very expensive for the amount that you get and is not a strong probiotic blend.Best bet is to go to your health food store/or online and look for a good probiotic blend that is not only less expensive but stronger than Threelac
1,Lac 3 is junk,"This product is NOT for people who have any kind of yeast sensitivity. That is one of the ingredience, but the manufacture states that the small amount of yeast that's in this product is necessary for it to work properly and will not effect the user. Thats a crock of ****! I'm very sensitive to yeast, maybe even allergic, and after taking Lac3 I was down for several days.Don't waste your money on this product."
1,Caused my IBS to flare up,"I have used this product before with no problem, but it really caused a flare up . I also found that it is from Japan and I might not have bought it due to concerns about radiation."
3,lemon flavor lacking,I am using this for my 6 yr old son. Has just enough lemon flavor you can't hide it in anything but not enough of a lemon flavor to make it good. He likes it in water with some added lemon juice to make it taste better. Haven't been using it long enough to really predict whether it works or not.
1,Candida - NO THREELAC or FIVELAC!!!!!,"Blood Pressure went sky high-ended up in hospital & I'm still not well and it's been over a week. Don't have to mention the fact that it a didn't do a thing for my candida, my doctor actually finally helped me. This internet stuff is ALL a scam no matter which one you take. I'm 67 years old and can't afford to get sick like this, not to mention have to pay for all the hospital and doctor bills!!"
1,Suspicious Reviews,"I am suspicious of most of these reviews. After several months of use with limited to no sugar intake and avoidance of other provoking diets, there was no result. Again, some of these reviews are suspicious."
5,It Just Works !,"There are lots of these 'probotic' products on the market now but I always come back to this one. It works wonders as long as you actually use it. When you get feeling great and decide you dont need to use it anymore, you allow your system to be overrun again and have to start again. If you suffer from candida issue, this is the answer and it works wonders."
3,Get Properly Diagnosed before buying this product,"This didn't do much for me and thats probably because I used it after doing the spittle test and thinking that I ""mighta-coulda-maybe"" have candida. I took it for over a month and it didn't do anything...which makes sense because I'm pretty sure that I don't have candida now. So, before you spend this amount of money, get properly diagnosed. It does get frustrating trying to figure out whats wrong with yourself sometimes, but you don't want to just throw money away. I gave it three stars because I'm sure Threelac does something for people who need it, but just not for me, so I can't quite accurately rate it."
4,too early to tell,"i have been using this product for a month now and i have seen some pretty good results, being mainly, my acne outbreaks have decreased, i dont know if it's this product that's helping me or if it's some colon cleanse pill im taking, i will continue to use this product."
4,Pretty good but...,"Was pleasantly surprised at the taste of the powder since I was expecting it to hit my gag reflexes. For the first week I actually began to feel relief from some symptoms like fatigue. But in the second week I began with violent diarrhea that went on for two more weeks. It appears that I am allergic to something in the product. Too bad, I think it could have worked for me."
3,threelac/fivelac,"I think this product has certainly helped me with my digestion and possibly Candida. I have all the symptoms of candida, oral thrush, occasional foggy head/dizziness, constantly tired etc..I've been using one packet a day for the past 3 1/2 weeks. I stuck to a strict candida diet for the first week however I noticed in the second week that I was losing weight. I am a 28 yr old male. I started out at 172 lbs. I am in good shape and workout 3-4 days a week. I am now down to 165 lbs. Now this may be a good side effect for some people however I do not want to drop any weight. I may attribute this to diet however in the last two weeks I went back to eating almost as I was before taking the product. I may have to stop taking it. Has this happened to anyone else?"
1,no good,I researched lots of brands of Probiotics before I purchase this product. It is expensive but it didn't work for me. The Acidophilus with Pectin from The Vitamin Shope is cheaper and works better.
1,Bad reaction,"I tried this product for 3 months and kept thinking give it a chance it's probably die off but I now am worse than ever and while on it I started to get terrible joint pain which I now have constantly in my legs and can't get rid of it. I have never felt so bad, having suffered with candida for years I thought I would get better but I am worse than ever and I swear it brought more health problems on after using it."
2,No respect for this company,"First of, if you are confident that your product is good, why post scam websites advertising threelac ? The spit test is a scam. You can get a better probiotic for a fraction of the cost. Will not buy again."
1,This product made me sick,"I tried Threelac twice and both times it made me very ill. The first time I got severe intestinal cramps and gas, so I gave it a rest and thought maybe it was something that I ate. I tried it again a few weeks later and developed a severe vaginal yeast infection and a sore throat. I don't think this product is for everyone. Since it has been over 30 days I can't return it to Amazon. I am very disappointed as I really believed all the hype. I guess there is no such thing as a miracle cure!!! I have suffered for years with a systemic yeast problem and was hoping for more. I guess it's back to the drawing board, and the Threelac is going in the trash after only using 6 packets!! What a waste of money!!!!"
1,Bewildered at ineffectiveness,I expected great results because of the hype advertising and amazing website but I was sorely disappointed. I tracked my usage and kept a journal on symptoms and can only say I am disappointed in this product.
1,Threelac is A Complete Waste of Money,I have used 2 boxes of Threelac and I have not been able to detect any decline in my Candida infection.
1,ummm. . .,I heard so much about this product aiding digestion and this and that. It gave me the worst flatulence imagineable! The very first dose it aided in my digestion. After that just air. I wouldn't reccomend this product.
3,Be aware,"If you're thinking of buying this based on reviews, please note that most reviewers have only reviewed this product, and all their reviews say more or less the same. Ii think this is suspicious.I haven't used this product. That's why I've given it 3 stars, so it won't influence their rating. I'm not saying you should or shouldnt buy this. But do proceed with caution."
5,Great Product,"I've been using threelac now for about a month. This product really works I have more enegry,I feel happier,and it really seems to have made my mind seem less clouder(confused). I've noticed a change in my bowel movements there more frequent with less strain sorry so detailed but it's true, and I really don't crave sugar the way I used to. I actually crave more healthier foods. This is a great product. I feel I will forever be a consumer of this product. This product actually changes the pH of your body. I took this product with oxygen element also which is said to give more oxygen to cells to help produce healthier cell growth. I hope this will help you! Because it sure helped me! Good luck."
3,GFCF people beware! Contains casein!,"Just a little FYI, since most people who are interested in combating the multiple problems of autism and it's spectrum disorders sometimes follow a STRICT gluten-free casein-free diet, I noticed the last time I read the ingredients list that it stated ""Contains an ingredient derived from milk. (12 ppm Casein)""Amazon has not updated the ingredients list, so I just wanted to inform those gfcf parents and people who are following a strict gfcf diet that this may not be appropriate if you are extremely casein sensitive. Hope this helps all and even those with a dairy allergy/anaphylaxis to make a more informed choice. Thank you!"
2,Bad reaction to this stuff,"I ordered this out of desperation after 9 months of muscle aches and cramping, joint pain and dizziness. I followed all of the instructions on the box - took one pack per day with water, after a meal. The first two days went fairly smoothly. I experienced headaches and increased muscle pain, and wrote it off as the ""die-off"" everyone is talking about.On the third day, about 45 minutes after taking the packet I got, erm, 'explosive' diarrhea followed by very intense abdominal cramps for several hours. A full day later my digestive system is still not working OK.Be careful with threelac. Following the directions doesn't necessarily mean your body will be OK with it."
2,"Great idea, but poorly executed","I had a LitterMaid for a couple years until the gearbox stripped. Thankfully this PetMate box was given to me because despite working better for a couple months, it now jams constantly. It's huge, litter gets scooped over the corners onto the floor, and scooped under the liner until I taped the edge down. I've torn it apart several times and still can't get the rake to stop binding up on the return stroke. I've just about had it with these ""self cleaning"" cat boxes, they're expensive and both have been more work than an ordinary litter box. Doesn't anyone make one that *works*?"
1,"great idea, poor implementation",Just purchased this last week and returned it after 3 days. The grate sticks to the lid and required constant adjusting. The plastic bag disposal area got immediately ripped when my cat was burying his feces. Don't waste your money on this one.
1,one step above totally useless,"the cleaning mechanism gets stuck constantly unless you use just a little litter at a time. when you don't use enough litter however, nothing gets cleaned out. the drop basket requires a special plastic bag that is absolutely useless. it's difficult to install and always gets caught-up. many times the lid on the drop basket falls off. don't waste your money. i'd return this in a second, but no returns after use. AVOID, AVOID, AVOID."
2,"Great product, doesn't last","We had one of the original littermaids (with 2 cats) and it lasted for almost 4 years before it finally died. I was actually surprised it lasted so long. But I was a little frustrated over the rake getting litter stuck to it. This litterbox has a metal rake, so we decided to give it a try. When we first got it, we realized one of our cats would not use it with the hood on. I think it got too stinky inside for him or something. After removing the hood, the cats seemed to like it; I liked that it had a liner for the bottom, and instead of plastic receptacles it took plastic bags (cheaper than littermaid), so monthly cleaning was a snap. Unfortunately it died after about a year, when it was no longer under warranty. I wouldn't recommend this box."
2,Very disappointing; Littermaid is better,"We bought this box as a replacement for our Littermaid box. I am sorry to say it was a big mistake.Assembly was complicated. Putting the waste bag in the box correctly is a huge pain; the Littermaid receptacle box is much easier to get into place. The bags also don't catch all of the litter, so it is very messy to clean up. And even some of the litter that makes it into the bag inevitably comes out as you remove the bag.Despite its labeling, it is not quiet (although the Littermaid is also a little on the noisy side). We have to turn it off every night otherwise the sound wakes up - and we don't even keep it in the bedroom. We can hear it with the bedroom door closed.As soon as I get the money I am going to chuck this box and invest in another Littermaid."
2,waist of money,This is a waist of money. The rake gets caught up on the lid and then it jams the littler box. I still use mine but the lid and the outside trim are in the basement. It was just a big waist of money. It is also very loud when it is running. I would not recomend this product.
2,smelly box!,"I've owned this box for over a year now. I bought it thinking that it would solve my litter box scooping days, but instead it smells and is a hassle. I have a very messy kitty who likes to pee all over the sides of the box and on the rake itself. I have to agree with several other reviewers, the litter does clump behind the rake once the cat does its business and makes the box malfunction. Also, my cat seems to go to the bathroom frequently, so once the ""trap"" fills up, the vented closer does not seal and lets all the odors out. I gave the box the benefit of the doubt, it does a good job of scooping out the mess in the box, but it does a horrible job with odor control. There are better products out there for the same cost."
2,"Neat idea, poor quality product","This sounded like a great idea, and it was in theory... but it broke after just over a year (as soon as the warranty expired, wouldn't you know), and it had various glitches even while it was mostly working.The final breakdown came when the sensors, four little ""eyes"" that are supposed to stop the automatic rake from completing if something (like a cat) is in the box, freaked out and decided that something was ALWAYS blocking the sensors. Always before, I emptied the box, scrubbed the sensors, and it worked again. At the end no amount of cleaning/clearing made any difference. It just ran a half-cycle (raked half the box) until the waste piled up, toppled over the top of the rake, and got packed behind it. What a mess.It wasn't worth the $$ for just over a year's service."
1,Waste of money,"I'm so sorry I didn't read the online reviews before I bought this piece of junk. The rake sits too low and too far forward to be effective in cleaning out clumps of urine; there is always a good amount left behind the rake that causes the rake to get hung up and stall. I have to take the whole contraption apart just to clean the rake (on a daily basis, mind you) and at this rate it would have been better and cheaper to stick with a regular cat box."
1,Fancy Looks Take Your Money & Time,"These contraptions look great but just don't work. I tried a LitterMaid product very similar to this one. First, are you really willing to pay this much for a kitty litter box? Don't forget that you have to buy special easy-tie bags for this product (let's see; keep counting that money), then you need the 9-volt batteries (not included) and premium scoopable, clumping litter that is a tad more expensive than regular (Arm & Hammer is the best). The handy-dandy `ramp rug' needs to be cleaned regularly and the Zeolite filter has to be replaced at least once a month (more money). It all looks good and care-free, but the reality is, that this is a gimmick that takes your time and money. Go simple, save money and use good Kitty Litter."
1,Perrforma PlusXL Self-Cleaning Litter Box,"I have five cats. I had a Litter Maid for about three years before it died and then bought this one. It is quieter than the Littermaid and it was also cheaper, but that is about all I can say about it. With five cats it is jammed up all the time. I still end up scooping litter, which I hate. Buy any other brand."
1,don't waste your money,"this thing is ridiculous...i have to ""clean"" it more than the traditional box...it misses tons of waste and gets stuck (gross) on the grates..it scoops alot of unused litter into the bag (which is too little) so fills up in one day...i only have one cat! it's noisy and big and when you have to take the pan to clean the whole thing (monthly so they say)it's like trying to get into fort knox...whatever...wish i would've kept the old one...i thought the smell would be better and it is except i did buy an additional carbon air purifyer for it as well..."
1,It stinks...,"The rake is constantly getting stuck. It was designed so poorly that you can't actually keep the hood on otherwise the rake doesn't have enough force to lift it to continue raking. I would NOT recommend this purchase. A while ago, I had purchased the litermaid litter box. It eventually broke, but it certainly lasted more than the two months the Purrforma Plus did. Again, save your money. You might as well use a normal litter box for as much as you have to clean the thing out manually anyway."
1,I miss the no frills,"This is the worst thing ever. It is huge. It is an ordeal to clean. The rake gets stuck and goes back and forth constantly. I live in an apt so i have to unplug it at night so it won't wake me up. I just turned it on 5 minutes ago and it just stopped. It is slow, loud, and only picks up the big stuff. Most of the time things just get stuck in the rake and then it scoops it all behind the rake instead of in the waste bin. You'll end up scooping this thing regularly behind the rake otherwise it makes an awful noise. The roll things on the rake broke after one month. I even duck taped them so the one is staying together for now. It makes it a little less messy to scoop, but the point of the product is for NO scooping. I'd rather stick to my quiet no frills standard litter box than this hunk of junk. I am regretting not giving these reviews more credit before I bought this. I'll just try and get my money worth and wait till the motor dies."
1,Self Cleaning????? Using me for the motor,"I am extremely disappointed in this product; first the plastic pan doesn't stay down, the rake gets stuck on the return to home position. The plastic bag idea is why I orginally when in this direction. Who vents a cat box in the house, hello we want to vent I would open the door and let the cats out. This product is a piece of ;aldjfoiuewqr. The sad part is that I spent $200.00 buying it. The second nail in the coffin is the pan, I had no clue that there was more then one size. I will disconnect the power, put plastic bags in for liners and use the cat box the old fashion way. But I will never buy another product from these people, poor design, testing must have been a joke, and the instructions for installing the bags in the box takes an engineer to figure them out. By the way I am one."
2,Its a bad product,"We bought this litterbox after our Littermaid unit died, and it has been a disappointment. It constantly misses clumps of litter, and the rake gets stuck about 75% of the time. The end result is that it requires so much intervention and attention, it doesn't feel like a ""self-cleaning"" litterbox at all. I despise it.I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it is easier to clean than the Littermaid."
1,Absolute Waste of Money,"I have had this product for less than 3 months and am experiencing all the problems others have reported. The rake gets locked up, clumps build up behind the grate then stick to the grate and push all clean litter into the recepticle. I have contacted Petmate many times regarding these issues and was told that it was ""My"" cat's potty habits. I was also recently told that I should spray the rake with some type of cooking spray. This does not work! I told the lady that I had just cleaned the entire box and it was still clumping to the rake. I currently have 3 different types of boxes of litter and nothing helps the clumping on the rake. At this point I feel very violated after spending over $200 for this. This product works best if you never plug it in or turn it on."
3,Loud but can get the job done.,"My husband and I have had this litterbox for over 6 months, and we are mixed on our feelings of it. The negative: it is loud and doesn't get everything. The positive: it has a long timer on it, so it doesn't scare our cats; if you don't use clumping litter, it works much better; and it is always clean enough to be nice for our cats. Yes, it misses stuff sometimes, but that's why you should clean it up a little once a week or so. If you don't use clumping litter, you'll save yourself a lot of trouble. It's not perfect, but it saves you a lot of time overall. We think that is, overall, worth the occasional problems."
1,Automatic?? The worst you can get!,"Purrforma XL is a source of constant frustration and required manual cleaning more often than not. The first one I bougth broke in less than 2 weeks. I've been using the ""QC"" sent replacement for ~6 months ... I thought I just needed to find out the tricks to make it work properly ... too optimistic. It constantly jams because the required litter level is too shallow, causing clumps to stick to the bottom of the litter tray and blocking the rake. The filter does not work at all! Smelly box! Removing the waste bag invariably results in litter being flicked into my face. If you're thinking in buying one, check some of the ""1 star"" reviews, they describe the litter box very accurately! This product is a good reason to have the ""0 star"" option included in the ratings!"
3,Deceptive title,"While this book seems to have a lot of good information, it would have been more accurately titled, ""The Complete Guide to Pregnancy After 40."" I was disappointed, expecting to find a majority of info specific to pregnancy in your 30s, but getting more info on a ""midlife pregnancy."""
4,Excellent if you're over 37,"This book needs to be retitled. According to this author, midlife is 40-50 for childrearing. There is very little information for women aged 30-35. That aside, it is very thorough about different stages of pre/pregnancy/birth/home. But a lot of the book's size is dedicated to things that women under 36 usually don't need to worry about (which is what the author tells you in the book)."
5,An Essential Guide,"Ms Winkelman is a respected medical writer who gives a wide range of workshops at federal agencies, universities and hospitals. Her book is an important addition to the growing literature on later life pregnancy. It is extremely well written and provides a very clear discussion of a broad range of sometimes arcane topics ranging from tests to screen for fetal abnormalities to the studies evaluating the cancer risks posed by taking fertility drugs. The book is remarkable for a balanced view of the risks and opportunities presented by motherhood in later life. I would recommend it to anyone contemplating becoming a parent in the older age group."
3,Soap Soap Soap,This soap lathers up very well smells great and was very quickly shipped by the seller.
3,Good addition to my collection.,"This is a good DVD; however, I am not really big on ""Opry"" music. I bought this, looking for a certain song, which turned out to be on another DVD, -blue grass no less. (Oh well, got it!) Even so, I am not at all disappointed with this DVD. The title gave me clue, so the ""Opry"" flavor was not a surprise. If you enjoy country, you will enjoy this. Or, if you are like me, you will just take it for what it is, and enjoy having something a bit different. After all, The Grand Old Opry has been around for many decades, and some folks think it is the best of the best. So! This DVD honors that.Mickey Thorne"
5,Nashville Homecoming,"As with all of the Homecomings, this will NOT disappoint you. If you like gospel music,you will love thisDVD. I hightly recommend this to everyone as the Gaithers do not stop producing excellence."
5,A must read for children and adults alike!,"My children and I have thorougly enjoyed our reading aloud of ""Davy Crockett: His Own Story"". Written by Davy himself you feel like you are standing along side this great man of courage, determination, and heroism. We were rivoted by the honoring way this man lived his life. An awesome model for boys to emulate!"
2,Only half the story,"I bought this book specifically because Davy Crockett himself was the author. I thought it would contain his entire autobiography, but the book ends before he goes off to Congress. The book and type are also much larger than I realized they would be. This book is more suitable for younger children. As an adult, I am quite disappointed."
3,Davy Crockett (His Own Story),"It was good, interesting, and certainly written in the style of the period. He really had a thing for bears. Pioneers were super tough in eighteenth American. Swimming those frozen rivers and shinning up a tree and sliding down just to keep from freezing tells a lot about his toughness. It left me wanting more, and ended with nothing about his travels to Texas and his experiences there. Can't fault him for not writing about the Alamo since he died there."
4,Visitors come to the convent,"Change is in the wind as visitors come to the convent of the Order of the Daughters of Compassion. Two prospective nuns, Magdelen and Bernadette, travel to Cornwall and are met by Sister Joan. They both seem determined to enter the religious life, but Joan is not sure of the suitability of one of the girls. Added to this, there are several new-age travelers who are camping nearby, and a hermit who has taken up residence in the former schoolhouse. This cast of characters provides plenty of suspects when one of the young postulants is found murdered. Although Sister Joan is on the trail of the perpetrator, she needs the help of Detective Sergeant Mill in order to escape the murderer herself. This is an interesting and well-written ""cozy""."
4,Trademark 1000 Chip 11.5g High Roller Set with Aluminum Case (Silver),I really like these chips. You can use as dollars or coins since it only has the number on them. The case seems to be holding up. Also note that with this amount of chips in a case it can be pretty heavy. I ended up ordering two cases.
4,We Wuv Weebelot!,"I bought this for my daughter when she was about 15 months. She didn't ""really"" got into playing with it until about 21 months. She loves it. She makes the Weebles go down the slide and say ""Whee!"". We bought the expansion pack so she also pushes them in the swing. Her new favorit activity is to shove all her Weebles and Fisher Price Little People in the moat and make them spin around. Overall this is a first-rate toy!My one quibble... to open the drawbridge, you are supposed to push down on this flag. My daughter just can't seem to do this and gets frustrated. I've shown her other ways to open the door, but of course, she wants to do the flag."
4,Weebles wobble but they don't fall down.,"Weebles were my favorite toy when I was young, providing me with hours of fun! My daughter is equally entranced by them and often matches them with her Little People and creates an entire city.My issue with some of the Weeble toys is that they don't function the way you think they will. Like with all the things that spin in order to get the Weebles wobbling there is often a traffic back up pretty much rendering the idea of the toy useless. The unit is so big and to not have it work properly makes you wish the could design it differently.I gave it four stars for the traffic jams, but from my daughter it would receive 5 for the hours of fun it provides her.Nowadays, I don't buy these Weeble play units myself, but never mind them as a gift. I buy the Weebles by themselves to play in the units I already own."
4,"Fun, but doesn't stay together","My 16-month-old daughter got this for Christmas and she loves it! I agree with other reviewers though -- it would be a lot better if the stairs stayed attached to the thing. Without one set of stairs, the drawbridge doesn't stay up high enough for the weebles to clear it when they are spinning in the moat. Did Playskool not consider this aspect in the design? Is there a reason why the stairs are not attached more securely?"
3,"Castle OK, but not as fun as other Weebles products","We bought this castle, because all of my kids have LOVED the weeble town that we have. This castle is ok, but not nearly as fun as the others.My major complaints:1. Music does not play for very long, you have to continually hit a button for it to start again.2. Not as many areas for the weeble people to go around on. Just a moat under the castle that is hard for my son to get his hands on.Perhaps, if we did not have any other Weebles toys this would be okay, but there are just too many Weeble products that are a lot more entertaining - and cheaper."
3,Not a exact fit,If you have the mirror mounted back up camera system this shade takes a little extra effort to place in the window. Other than that works great.
5,Betty Wright Be Throwing Down,"I Grew Up Listen To Betty Wright,Betty Wright Has A Very Strong Voice With An Style Of Her Own,But Most Of All She Always Put God In Most Of Her Songs Not Forgetting Where Her Help Come From!... When You Buy Any Of Betty Wrights Cd's You Get Your Money Worth!... Betty Wright Also Give You Your Money Worth When She Does A Concert!... ""Where Is The Love"",""From Pain To Joy"" & ""Tonight Is The Night"",""A Song For You""Are Some Of My Favorites By Betty Wright!..."
3,Soul-Sister,"She knows how to sing from the soul. Her music really has heart. Some songs are more spirtual then disco, but she covers all bases."
4,A classic set of Southern R&B from the Queen of Miami Soul.,"I, for one, do not believe this was really a ""Live"" recording as the applause sounds canned and unnatural. This album, however, is a classic set of Southern R&B from Miami's original ""Soul Queen"" and it proves why she went on to become one of the genre's premier divas."
2,Needs work,I purchased this camera in order to download/record video for viewing later. The camera is great however I have had a lot of difficulty getting the audio and video in-synch. Still not sure what the problem is.
3,"Buggy, horrible support","The software is a bit buggy and dealing with d-link support is something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. The motion detection alarm does not work in the ipview se program, and dlink support was WAY less than helpful. I think they know it is a bug but refuse to admit it.That said, the camera works mostly as advertised (except the software bugs). If you buy this, pray you don't end up having to call dlink for help -- you won't get any.EDIT and update: the video constantly drops out and goes black. Support replaced mine with a refurbished older model (I am still very upset about this). This one also exhibits the same dropout problem. After further research, it seems that these cameras have an overheating problem which causes these dropouts. It's a defective design and i would avoid at all costs. Amazon won't let you change the star rating, but know I CHANGE MY RATING TO ZERO STARS."
2,Best Light Level poor support for cable modem network,This is the best low light IP camara I have found in its price range. However I also own an Linksys IP camara and found their software to be far more intuitive and user friendly. They also include support for cable modem style network (DHCP) sharing so you can broadcast the feed to the world. The Linksys was poor in low light situations though. Linksys's motion triggered event software =was much better out of the box as well.
3,Figured it Out Finally,"Finally figured out how to get around the constant rebooting issue. You shouldn't have to do this but the Camera does give a good picture. Once you open a browser and assuming you can log on and connect the first time, and after you have logged off, don't close the browser or go to another Web page on the same browser. Just minimize it and open another Browser for other Net activity. When you want to connect to the camera again, restore your minimized browser. You should have the Connect screen to sign in with. Have done this process the past few days and have connected everytime. It appears that when you log off from the camera and then go to other websites and then go back to try and log in again is when the reboot issue seems to come up way to often. Had also upgraded to the latest Firmware and that didn't seem seem to make any difference."
1,"Very bad camera, don't waste your time or money","At the computer store I help out with, I have tried to set up the camera and everything went wrong. Poor software, poor documentation and everything else went wrong. Do not buy the camera at all. It is a waste of money and it isn't even worth trying to get it to work properly."
1,Do not buy this camera,This is the first time that I have purchased a D-Link product and it will be the last. After speaking to tech support 3 times I was both discouraged and angry. The camera (DCS-950) was an incredible hassle to set up and despite proper port forwarding and download of the latest firmware the performance is very poor. Not even close to the advertised performance stats in the advertisement. I am sending this product back and hope that I can save someone time and money by posting this.

1,Don't waste your time!,"I have spent the past 3 weeks talking to I think every D-Link tech support person there is,(litterly all over the world)trying to get this camera to work. I can see it on my LAN but not on the internet. We could see the camera interface on the net, but no video, just a black screen. Most of the 1st level tech people don't have a clue. The 2nd level tech people seamed to know more, but still couldn't help. I can't tell you how many hours I have spent on this, not to mention the hours on hold and then getting cut off while takeng to tech support. It is going back tomorrow before my 30 days is up"
2,Unreliable at best and poorly documented.,"I am a networking professional with many years experience so I was able to get it to work. I have no idea how a novice would have any success with this device. The documentation is almost non-existent and some of the explanations are just flat wrong. I would not buy this product again.However, it is the first D-Link product I have been disappointed with. I really don't understand how they could have let this go out the door and what I find even more difficult to understand is why they don't at least provide updated and accurate documentation on the web site. My experience with this device seems very ""out of character"" for what I believe is a solid second tier manufacturer."
1,Very unreliable camera,"I got this camera 3 months back and had it running continuously. I was very pleased with the product TILL several days back. The video screen just went black. Rebooting the camera only got me the ""Camera Server Error!"" and a black screen at where the video screen is supposed to be.After googling for help, I found out that this is very common for DCS 950. It's a hardware failure... ...So much for a security camera....I've tried everything to salvage the camera. These are the stuff you should try before calling the D-Link technical support. The support is poor btw.1 ) Power cycle your camera2 ) Upgrade the firmware to the latest ( 1.08 at the time of this post )3 ) Delete the activeX in I.E and reinstall it4 ) Reset the camera using the reset button5 ) Reinstall everythingAfter that, call the tech support and tell them you've done all the above. Most probably you will get a replacement set.So much hassle for an unreliable security camera... ...not worth the trouble."
2,"Beware, it is not cotton",The rope is too light to provide a good swing. It looks like nylon more than cotton and it feels very cheap.Seller demands 20% restocking fee for something that is not described correctly
2,More suitable for infants,"My son received the Busy Beads pal for his 1st birthday, and unfortunately at 12 months this toy just fails to grab his attention. The suggested age range is 6-18 months so maybe if he got it at 6 months it might have been more interesting to him. At this stage he is more interested in sorting things, like blocks etc or colorful sing along toys."
5,"Bright, Colorful, and Engaging",When my daughter isn't chewing on the colorful parts she is occupied with sending the beads zipping about the tracks. The toy is light and durable while the colors are bright and eye catching so that she gravitates towards it. Highly recommended!
1,Child can't use,We are unable to get the item to set up so the child can play with it. Are we doing something wrong/
4,Not What You Think,"A fascinating read from a person with rare insights in to this reality we live in. I am not sure why he wants to be known as the AntiChrist. He understands God is the greatest force, nor is be seeking to bring evil to the world. It appears he wants to assist mankind with the power of magic. He is specially interested the Spitzalod Magic system, available from [...] (only authentic edition) and may soon be available on Amazon. This book is very odd, half Grimoire , half autobiography, and very confusing. But I like to see individuals write their personal beliefs and magic systems. There is a lot of new information about the Bible and what ""actually"" happened. A most interesting read. Do not let the title put you off. If you have an interest in the occult, you will find this book instructional, as well as refreshing to read.....Something really new!!"
5,Different from other texts,"When learning geometric optics, one usually learns concepts and equations using ordinary algebra. In this text, linear algebra is used. It gives the reader another way to manipulate problems than typically used. Highly recommended!"
2,pretty bad for the price,"Extremely light. And very small... i didn't had to buy those for a long time and forgot to look at the dimensions. my old one is 10mm in diameter and have a good 'feel' because of the weight, this one is 7mm and you can barely feel it in your hand.Also the included blade is very dull. required some sharpening before it became fun. really not worth the price. get a Chinese brand and be happy, as these are pretty much it."
3,Works Well Then -__-,Awesome when i took it out and began to use it then it DULLED in like a day then somehow someway i chipped the point...so weird it just broke.....gets the job done regardless tho.
5,Razor Knife Holder/Handle,"The handle that the blade goes in is awesome. However, for what I need the blades for didn't work for me. I use the blades for etching designs on dyed eggs. My fingers hold the handle way down on the handle like you would a pencil. The blade is sharp all the way down to the handle, so I can't hold the blade like I want to without getting cut. The blade, yes, is very sharp and can be used for cutting out things that is not intricate work. If you want to cut something where your hand can be way up on the handle, then the blade would be perfect. But, I would have to wrap tape around and around the blade that is nearest the knife handle just so I wouldn't cut myself, just to use the point on the projects I do."
3,"Decent, does the job","The price is right, but the meter isn't anything special. I bought it to put in my camper to check the occasional bad fuse, open circuit, test polarity, etc. and it does the job. It requires a 9v battery (not included) which means that the cost of batteries will be more than the cost of the meter before too long. Also, you have to have a small phillips screw driver to replace the battery. The manual is the barest possible and some functions (at least as it appears) aren't even explained. But, for the standard stuff that I bought it for, it works well. It is compact, but not as small as some others. Overall, it is sufficient."
2,Misleading offer,"I was enticed to look/buy the Actron CP7672 Multimeter as it was presented as a $30 item, on sale for $15. I found it to be of the same characteristics as multimeters found everywhere in the $15 to $20 range. It wasn't what I was expecting it to be - a better quality multimeter."
4,This one is a winner!,"This is quite a good recipe colloction, with plenty of old favourites, plus quite a few suprising flavour combinations that I have used with great results. As far as specialist gamebird cookery books go, this is a definite must buy!"
2,Very Dissappointed,"The book was loaded with complicated math formulas & the philosophy sections where just impossible to follow. There were about 50 pages where they actually researched the ""face"" that was interesting. The ending was a huge let down..."
2,Dissappointing,"The book was loaded with complicated math formulas & the philosophy sections where just impossible to follow. There were about 50 pages where they actually researched the ""face"" that was interesting. All in All - a huge let down..."
5,Childhood Favorite,"How Six Found Christmas was my absolute favorite Christmas story when I was a child. The illustrations are simple, beautiful, and expressive, as is all of Trina Schart Hyman's work. It is a story which focuses on the mysterious, very personal, very rich sensory experience that Christmas always is for the very young."
4,One of the best in the series.,"Great characters about whom you care and wonderful dialogue that makes you laugh and can tug your heart are the hallmarks of Robb's (Nora Roberts) writing. This is a very enjoyable series, best read in order, and this one of the better books in it."
3,My least favorite so far...,"This is my least favorite in the series so far. The romance aspect definitely took a back seat, as did the focus on secondary characters. I agree with other reviewers who described the writing as ""stiff."" It just didn't flow. The relationship between Eve and Roarke felt cold to me almost throughout the book (way too long), the storyline was sluggish, and I actually stopped reading it in the middle to read other books (never have done this to Eve and Roarke before!). I did finish it though, so I gave it 3 stars. I'm still looking forward to reading the rest of the series, but am hoping the next one is more exciting (plot-wise and relationship-wise)."
1,I have read better books,This was my first time reading a book of J.D. Robb and I did not care that much about it. I really think that it is stupid that an author as big as Nora Roberts has to make up another name for herself to do murder mysteries. When I started reading the book I thought the concept of the books was great. I was really eager to find out what was going to happen. After reading about half of the book it began to drag. And it dragged and it dragged. At one point I did not care to even finish the book but I did finish it. I thought the ending of the book was so disappointing. I thought more would happen. It was nothing excited about how they caught the killer. After I have read this book I don't think I will be reading other books from J.D. Robb. I would rather not read anything if I have to read another one of these books.
1,Distasteful,"I can not believe that Nora Robert cheapens herself by writing such drivel. This is the first and last J.D. Robb book I will chance reading. I only read it half way through. It was so unclear, seemingly written with the pretense of intelligence. I thought the constant empty dialogues were wasted breath. I have read seven books by Nora Roberts and I will have to wonder if she has a twin sister living insider her mind who must be writing the J.D. Robb stories. She seems to me to be wandering from realism in her Roberts books to total abstract in her Robb books. I think in her Robb stories she must be letting her hair down with all of the unnecessary swearing and attitude the female characters have. There is a lot of rage there. I will take Nora Roberts over Robb any day. Sorry Robb fans, I just think it is all to shallow to waste my time going there again. Just like paintings from abstract to real, different strokes for different folks."
3,One of the weaker ones,"I have followed this series since the beginning and I enjoy the setting and the characters immensely. However, I feel that this installment lacked in something that the other books did not. Yes, this book has plenty of Eve, plenty of Roarke and plenty of Eve and Roarke together. There is suitable development with their relationship, and the underlying plot line of her childhood. I actually can't put my finger on what this book lacks, exactly. It just felt empty and while I would never dream of skipping a book in such a long running series, I can't help but wonder what this installment adds to the series as a whole. I personally, thought, I suppose, that it was too complicated ... but I suppose most spy tales are complicated."
4,Lots of Emotions,I couldn't wait. I put my name at the library prior to release. I read it in 3 days. I loved the emotions that Eve and Roake go through. As for the mystery part it was good put the ending was a bit abrupt for me. I wanted more follow up after the bad guy was caught.
4,Eve and Roarke at their best,"As always, part of what I love with Robb is the development of Eve and Roarke. Parts of the book dragged (as most books sometimes do) but I still love how things are between Eve and Roarke. Favorite part of the book is when they resolve their differences."
2,Just ok......,I have to agree with the other reviewers that this book was not up to the usual J.D Robb standards! I waited with high anticipation for this book.....and I'm sad to say that it was a disapointment....the whole conflict between Roark and Eve was sooo contrived and fake! the whole story was just not up to par....I can only hope that the next book brings me back to the love of her work!
3,not for the kindle,"I have nothing against the book--trying to get a full death series collection on my kindle. this is one of three that are unavailable in the usa on the kindle: portrait, imitation and divided. To have all electronic version, i had to go to another vendor to get the three books, they are on my computer, so it is a kindle gap."
2,Save your money,"I'm an avid JD Robb fan and have rushed out to buy everyone of her books upon release.... don't waste your money on this one. While it had it's good points, it wasn't worthy of it's hardcover price. Save your money and borrow it from the library."
2,Same old thing with a new title,I have enjoyed the Eve Dallas series very much but I have the sense that either JD Robb has run out of new ideas or is just tired of the series. The phrases in this book are repeitions of dialogs from past books in this series. It gave me the impression that she had phrases mapped to keys on her keyboard and she just pressed keys to insert dialog. I'll have to think before I spend money on any more of these titles and I'm sad that these aren't enjoyable any longer.
4,"Excellent Book,, but....","I have read all of the ""in Death"" books, and will continue to read them. This is a great addition, however I must say the rhapsodizing that Eve and Roarke do seems just, well silly....These characters love each other, that much we know. We know the depth of their love for one another, but there are more than a few spots in the book where Eve just seems to break character so that she can wax romantic about her handsome husband.Roarke's gushing over his wife is a little more believable, but what I find trite is at the start of every single one of these little episodes the characters have to rehash their bad childhoods. Did they forget since the last time they went over it? Have the details changed? No, I would just love to see Robb move these characters past their 'revalations' about their childhoods and let them move on to a different area of their relationship."
3,let down and disappointed,"I have greatly enjoyed the IN DEATH series. You can pick up any of the books in the series and they stand on their own but make you want to find any previous books or the next one to be published.However, I was let down in the lack of involvment with the other characters even the non human ones. Her car, the cat, Roarks house, style. True she has been married a year + and is getting use to the ambience of the Roark's life but I thought that was lacking.Her whole demeaner was severly different to when other people close to her were invoved in a case. She held true to form in her belief of the lines for law and order.There also appeared to be a lack of submitting reports to her commander. Dealing with the press and Nadene.The ending I found a let down. Eve's discussion with Roard regarding his ego when he let his vengenace go I thought was out of character, and Roark's response ""wierd him out""!!What@@"
1,Not available via Kindle in the US?,Why can't I get Portrait in Death and Divided in Death via Kindle in the US? Does anyone have any tips on how I can manage to do this? Thanks!
1,"I liked the book, but...","I liked the book. I have been eagerly anticipating the next book in the In Death series. I am, however, very disappointed in J.D. Robb (Nora Roberts). One of the reasons that this series has been so great is that every time a new installment has been released it was easy, convenient, and affordable to read. All of the other books were first released as paperback novels. This one is only in hardcover, for the time being. I am very disgusted that an already famous author needs to cheat her readers and pad her pocket. Shame on you, Nora!"
4,Not my favorite of the series,"I've been reading these books since I discovered them some months ago. This installment, was not one of my favorites. The spy aspect almost dragged out the book, making it somewhat difficult for me to really get into. However, I did finish the book and would not recommend skipping it as there are some great character growths in this one. Unfortunately, the crime story, while well written, was simply lacking its usual finesse."
3,"good start, but didn't last","I was very excited to start reading the latest Eve Dallas book. I had finished about a quarter of the book in the first night and thought the story was great. Then the Eve & Roarke backstory came in, along with the Eve-as-a-child parts. It became very unsatisfying very quickly after that. The ending was a huge disappointment to me and the entire resolution was just - lame.It seems like Nora Roberts just isn't putting the same effort into this series as she once did. The stories have all been the same formula and the same ideas. Let's hope Vision in Death is better."
3,Not for Mac,"This is the second set of Cyrillic stickers that I have purchased on amazon. Here are the pros and cons of these:Pros:-Heavy plastic, not likely to bubble or wrinkle-Small white letters, not obtrusive or unprofessional looking-If you're using other slavic languages, there are some other character stickers (not helpful for modern Russian usage)Cons:-Made for Windows only, not all stickers needed for Mac layout-No notches for f and j stickers (for the little lines on the keys)-While the heavier plastic seems durable, the stickers don't cling as closely to the keys as the other ones I have so there is more glarePersonally I think these were a little overpriced, but they will get the job done."
3,Fast but not in good conidtion,"Book came very fast, very helpful but book was not as good as I thought ""good"" meant. Lots and Lots of highlighting no room to make notes or re-highlight."
4,I love Ninja Turtles!,"This toy is great! It comes with Casey Jones, Michaelangelo, and a Foot Soldier, unlike the picture that is shown. The box that you really get looks very different. Casey has blue pants, not black, and Mike is facing the other way, and there is only one turtle, not 4. It comes with a barrel of ooze, a Skateboard, Nunchakus, a clear Stunt Stick, a carrying case for Casey Jones' weapons which are a Baseball bat and a Hockey stick, and a sword for the Foot Soldier. I also recommend the Battle Shell Bridge. That's another fun one!"
5,1/4 pipe rocks,This toy is great. You get mike casey and a foot solider. It also comes with a cool skateboard. It is a great toy for the money.
5,Good Deal!,The antenna was the right part and I heard no problems with anything to do with the antenna installation. My experience with the whole project was enjoyable and I look forward to more transactions with your Amazon store!!!
5,Excellent book!,"I thought this book was great for the new puppy owner to be. I bought this book over a month before my pup came home, and I read it twice or three times. I felt prepared for the arrival of my new pup, because of the good info this book provided. Teaches you several different ways to train your pup, all of which are POSITIVE methods. Highly recommend this book."
3,Not sure about this....,"Some of the techniques in this book work and others are questionable. What they teach in this book does not work for every dog. Each dog is an individual just like a person, and different things work for different dogs. I think Cesar Millan's methods are much more effective in my opinion. This book does not dig very deep into dog psychology."
5,Economic and human development that works!,"Bornstein offers a truly inspirational and touching story of how the Grameen Bank has helped millions of poor people in Bangladesh. Professor Yunus, Grameen's founder, is the charismatic leader who transforms seemingly far-fetched dreams into real ideas that actually worked! It felt like I was reading a fairytale but the wonderful part is that this is real. We CAN eradicate poverty! If anything, this book gives all of us hope. It is not just Professor Yunus that is the genius; it is the people. With the right opportunity and resources, people can do anything, even stop the vicious cycle of poverty.EVERY person that is interested in Economics, Development or in Bangladesh MUST read this book-- a true testament to human achievement!"
5,5 Stars,This is the best book Ive ever read. I'm an international banker of Banladeshi origin working for one of the worlds biggest bank. After reading this book I feel I want to quit my day job and work for Grameen and actually make a difference to the world by helping to eradicate world poverty.David Bornstein has written the book beautifully.Dr Yunus is a legend.... Respect to you siromar_rahim@hotmail.com
4,"A Great Book, if a Little Lengthy","After reading this book on loan from the local library, I decided I simply had to have my own copy. The analysis of the seven basic plot types, plus two sub-plots, provides a wonderful over view of each genre, setting forth the key elements of each.For those readers who are willing to really mine this work for all of its gold, I would strongly recommend as an accompanying text ""The Soul of Screenwriting: On Writing, Dramatic Truth, and Knowing Yourself"" by Keith Cunningham. Although the title suggests the book is aimed essentially for those interested in screenwriting, I believe it could be profitably used by any writer of fiction. Keith really puts meat on the bones that Christopher lays out."
2,Seven Basic Plots,"The title of this book was full of promise; the actual book is not. It is full of inaccuracies for starters and it ismuch longer than it has any reason to be. Just a sample of some to the plot inaccuracies: the author states thatthe play PYGMALION has a happier ending than the film, MY FAIR LADY, because Eliza marries the Professor in the play.Completely incorrect; the play ends virtually identically to the film. Also, the author botches up the story of HIGH NOON. Leads me to wonder how many other plot lines the author gets wrong. And this book is primarily composed ofspecific details about countless plots.I should have known better than to buy it since it was recommended by Mick LaSalle.Bob C.San Francisco"
3,A wonderful reference,"Take the time to read the whole 800 pages (give or take) and you will see the connection between plots, character types, and more. Then you will see that life is exactly the fiction we read. Art imitates life or... the other way around. As you read through, you will think not only of movie and book characters and plots, but of people you know with traits that belong to monsters and heros, damsels and royalty and you will see there is nothing new under the sun.WRITERS: If you've ever had problems deciding where your plot should go or how your character SHOULD react to a given situation, this book answers all your questions.Get a copy and mark and earmark. It's actually a dictionary written in easy prose.Is it too long? Maybe. It's hard to digest so much info, so take a section at a time. I think it's very, very good."
4,An Important Book,"This is a fantastic book on the subject of storytelling and story structure. I couldn't recommend it enough. I can't tell you how many books on the subject that I have read, and been disappointed with. This is the only one that I feel really boils it down to the cold hard truths about story structure. The only reason that it doesn't get the full five stars is because it's overly long. I feel as if this book could have been improved by removing some of the redundancy and better organizing the material. However, the actual content of the book is beyond reproach. Any writer would benefit greatly from reading this. However, I think it is also fascinating from an anthropological, or even a historical standpoint as well. It serves many audiences. Do yourself a favor and read this book."
3,Great jumping off point,"As a member of a Middle Ages recreation group, I found some fantastic images that inspire me to create the garb they're showing. Unfortunately, Mr. Peacock doesn't provide a full bibliography of his sources so it is difficult to get a true feel for the context of the clothes. I emailed the publisher for more information, and they have yet to return my email...2 months later.I would definately recommend this book for anyone trying to get a good overview of garb and costume, but only if they do not care about being able to document exactly where the pattern and pieces come from."
4,An extensive overview of fashion history,"While this book isn't strong on text nor has any detailed clothing construction information, I do find it very inspiring when I'm looking for ideas for my own fashion designs. It's an excellent idea book and a general reference to those only superficially interested in fashion history in the western world. For something more in-depth for a seamstress or historian, you'd need to look elsewhere."
2,"Serious fashion historians, avoid this book.","Although Peacock made a valiant attempt at giving an overview of costume, this is an extremely poor source for anyone doing serious costume research. Some of the details--silhouette, trim, seamlines, etc.--are grossly distorted or misrepresented. Although readers may get a general idea of what clothing in other periods looked like, they should not take any of these drawings seriously unless they can be verified with other sources. Even a cursory look at the artwork from which Peacock's redrawings were done will show obvious inaccuracies. This book may be useful as a take-off point for further research but nothing more."
5,Wonderful music and messages!,"We are lucky to have seen Mr Ray live 4 times now so his catchy music I expected. The educational value for my 2-year-old was a pleasant surprise--days of the week, numbers, abc's, etc. The most wonderful thing about this DVD (and his other DVD) is the message Mr Ray gives children about being nice to each other and not hurting people's feelings. Otherwise, the video is just get-up-and-dance fun!!! Wishing you continued success Mr Ray!!!"
1,Contains cancer causing chemicals,"When the package arrived only then I found ""WARNING: This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm."".I wish I had found this warning earlier on the website. (It is there indeed - only now I found it , but it's not that visible. You can easily miss it. I did.The jump rope looks very nice. I wish I could give it to my daughter as a gift. Knowing about the chemicals I'll have to return it. What a pain."
2,Lee,The rope is too flimsy. It would not serve the purpose well especially if you are over 5ft 6ins.
1,Item Sent Not Shown In Picture,Item received was NOT the item that was pictured. Very disappointed! Will NEVER purchase from this sleer again!!! Starting lineup that was purchased was nothing but an opener. I paid way more than an opener!!!
3,Soul Hits of the '70s: Didn't It Blow Your Mind! - Vol. 7,"Just a so-so production. CD covers were the best creation and gave indication of good product, which proved to be just shallow advertisement."
2,Spongebob has lost it's touch,"I remember Spongebob seasons 1, 2 and 3.Spongebob was loveably naive, Patrick was cute and naturally dim witted and Squidward was quiet, kept to himself unless he was annoyed. The world was ideal, and the episodes were clever enough to appeal to children to adults.Now the episodes are rushed and are quite insulting to one's intellect. The worst part though is the magnification of each characters qualities.Spongebob, rather than being the loveable naive character, has been written to be as obnoxious and loud as possible. Both voice and action. I can hardly stand to listen to his voice anymore because of the over exaggeration of his annoying voice which used to be subtle.Patrick is written to be as stupid as he can possibly be, and Squidward is utterly piss*d off all the time. In addition, every other character has been destroyed as well.Avoid this DVD set, get the classic set of Spongebob seasons."
3,"Good, but the directors got bored","I loved the earlier seasons, and I'm ok with this new one, but the new episodes are not as clever as the first episodes in the first seasons. The new ones arn't as funny, the story lines arn't as good, and they have gotten WAY more childish, sadly. Also, my problem is that the new episodes have these stupid sing along songs much to frequently. SB used to be like a child/immature adult show. Now it's faded into one of those new Nick show types for babies. It's better than any other cartoon on Nick, but season 5, or maybe 6, will probably be the ending for the SB franchise.When I buy the seasons, one by one, I will make sure to get this season because I love the show as a whole. But this season is definetly not as superior as seasons 1, 2, or 3."
2,"Slows down computer, 1/4th of the pages won't even load.","Another internet security let down. The first problem I encountered was it trying to block Internet Explorer; my options were ""Allow once"" or ""Deny Once"", I'd click ""Allow Once"" since there was no ""Always allow"" option, and up comes the prompt a second later >_< On top of that, half of the pages I go to won't load, downloads freeze, and it made my broadband connection twice as slow. I gave it 2 stars because it does seem to be protecting against attacks but ruining my connection and ability but I've come to expect this from internet security programs."
3,peanut butter??,"I bought this for a friend who is always on some diet. She said it masked the flavor of her medifast oatmeal and shakes. She seemed to like it along with the egg nog (she says the best one) and pumpkin pie. She like the fact it has no carbs, fat, and calories(?)"
3,Diaper Dolphins,"The tape is informative, but needs to be updated. It gives you a good overview of the steps you need to take to get your baby to hold their breath under water."
2,I would rather take the stairs,"If this was playing in an elevator, I would rather take the stairs!Dance DJs and serious collectors should be advised that this ""orchestra"" sounds very much like it is synthesized. The monotonous percussion is supplied but what appears to be a reasonably good drum machine. The non-piano keyboards are often in a cheesy 1970s style.This waltz disc has appropriate tempos, about 30 measures per minute. All of the tracks are played by the Ray Hamilton Orchestra except the first, which was performed by the Gary Tesca Orchestra. It all sounds much the same, except for ""Somewhere Between,"" which has a distinct country twang to it."
4,Ball Carts,"This was a nicely made cart, easy to install and handy to use. I bought four of them for our Church. (interior basketball courts) My only issue was with the main wheels. Considering the cart is sold as ""heavy duty"", The wheels should have been of higher quality, perhaps a steel rim with a true rubber tire and a better axle set up. They wobble. They are flimsy plastic and if you tighten up the axles to correct this issue, they lock up and do not roll. Other than the wheels, a great ball locker cart. I intend to install heavy duty wheels and axles on all 4 of our carts."
2,Stopped working in less than 30 minutes - but it appears to have been the batteries,"I wouldn't say the instructions are confusing; air strength is adequate considering the size of the table (puck does occassionally get stuck, but it really is ok). Our biggest frustration is that low battery power seems to result in ""strange and mysterious"" behavior ... like shutting off in the middle of the game. Apparently it doesn't do well with cheapo batteries even if they are brand new. It really needs a low battery indicator. Hasbro could have made that annoying voice announce that the battery power is low.I echo others that the pucks are hard for the kids to keep up with. A sealed pocket to keep them in the board would have been an improvement.Music and sound will drive you bonkers. Needs volume control and/or option to play in ""silent mode""."
1,Broken out of the box,"My kids received this as a Christmas present. It didn't work straight out of the box. My husband tested the electronics, too technical for me, but basically the fan wouldn't turn on because something electrical was screwed up. I shipped it back to Hasbro (we're APO, I can't return it to a store) and after reading all the other reviews I hope they send me a new toy instead of replacing this one.At least Hasbro seems to be good about replacing their items that are defective. I've had to return items before because they were broken out of the box and it's always been a hassle free experience."
4,pretty cool,"my kids love it 2,4, & 16 they can play together or alone. The only thing that I don't like is the fact that it is a little hard to store because of it's size and the pucks are easily lost. Other wise this is a pretty cool game."
4,Great game - fun but one problem,"As one of the other reviewers said, it won't shut off! We had it working fine - shut it off manually by holding the red button down for 5 seconds. It shut off and was fine. Then my son went near it and it started up on it's own. Then the fan started to click. Tried to shut it off manually again, and the guy does the countdown but the fan stayed on and kept clicking. I really don't want to have to unscrew the battery compartment every time we shut it down - it does seem to work with the auto shut off but then again, when it's bumped, moved or someone goes near it, it starts up again. I'm going to try to exchange it hoping this one is defective...."
2,Don't waste your money,"I bought this item for my three year old for Christmas. He did love it. At first I was impressed by how easy it was and how it sounded and felt like a real table. Within 5 days after we opened it, it would not turn off. I did read the directions and tried to hold down the button. Nothing worked except taking the batteries out. Even when only three batteries were in it, the lights remained on. I am now returning it. I also think the volume is excessive. It is by far the loudest toy we own."
2,Broke After One Day,"Worked great for one day, then it would just turn on, the announcer would say, ""uh-oh,"" and it would turn off on its own. The game wasn't mistreated - just stopped working. Needs a volume control, but otherwise a fun toy. For those who claim it doesn't have an off switch, you need to read the directions. The note in red print says to push and hold the game selector button for five seconds, and the game turns off. It works. Try it."
1,Not exciting enough for a five year old.,"The round pucks barely work at all. The square ones work OK. To use the pinball, don't bother to use the stand; the board has to be lifted several inches higher than the faulty stand allows for. Someone has to be on the other side of the game board to retrieve the puck for you (it would be better if it could somehow be returned to you).A frustrating, boring (and expensive) game for my daughter. The box made it look like so much fun. How disappointing!"
4,VE-Day Memories,Great Big Band Jazz music of World War 2 in Canada. I'll Never Smile Again by Tommy Dorsey & sung by Frank Sinatra is my favorite as it was the song that was so popular when I was born. Very nostalgic to hear the good sounds from back then.
1,Save Me Lord,"This is album is new? I could've of swore I heard this in 1985. Maybe not but I still think I heard track 6 playing in the locker room when the Royals won the series. However, if cheesy butt metal is what you dig this CD is for you."
1,bad sound,"Nice songs, but what a big dissapointment: many tracks are transfered from vinyl to cd. Bad, Bad, Bad sound quality in some songs!!!!. So if you're a little bit def and don't care 'bout sound quality just buy it, if you have good ears don't buy it!."
3,No frills pack frame,"I purchased this pack frame for my wife since I have owned one of the early Kelty pack frames for 30 years. It has no sturnum strap to hold shoulder straps together. It needs lots more drilled holes for pin adjustments of various components. The webbing is B quality. That said, it is fairly light - weighing in at 3 lbs. 6 oz. and the welding of aluminum tubing is very good. It also has optional hangers both high and low for the shelf - or the shelf can be removed easily via the pin system. It will probably hold up OK for moderate use."
2,Fell Apart,This pack frame fell apart on me after only two hikes. The plastic buckles don't even snap together correctly and then pull apart when they do. Not worth your time.
5,a must have,"This CD transcends labels or genres. Some call it Americana, some call it Country Rock, to me it's just flat out good stuff. Tom Gillam is a singer songwriter slide guitar player whose talent shines through on every track of this cd. With subtle hints of Joe Walsh, Gregg Allman, Pete Droge, and Dan Baird, Tom blends many of his own influences into a unique style that is fresh and captivating. This now lives in my disc player, where it gets played over and over. Tell your friends about this one, they will be thankful you did."
5,The Highly Selective Dictionary of Golden Adjectives [Kindle Edition],My wife bought this kindle book to help with her new project...writing a book. She said it is a great help in finding the right word for the right thought.
2,"Thanks for trying, but. . . .","""Golden adjectives"" is a real stretch. In fact, some of these adjectives are so specialized or uninteresting that no English speaker would miss them if they were dropped from every existing dictionary. If you think ""abortifacient"" is a golden adjective, buy the book. Otherwise, you'd be better served by other resources."
3,Not words for public consumption or use,"It's difficult to imagine a use for this book. Most of the words listed are so uncommon and unrecognizable that every writer should be warned to stay away from it as if it could bring leprosy to their writing. Why? Because if you use a word that people don't understand, you lose your reader. And as a writer, that's the very last thing you want to do.As long as you don't try to use most of these words, it's a terrific little book that you can peruse through and perhaps find words for uses other than what this book may have intended. One example is the word lachrymose. Lemony Snicket used this word as the name of a lake in his book. Much sadness surrounded Lake Lachrymose, and since the definition of lachrymose is ""mournful; given to shedding tears"", it is appropriately named."
2,Difficult Breed,"I asked my husband for help with this one. It's rather a sad story for me because I bought the puppy for my husband thinking that after 3 Springer Spaniels it would be nice to have another spaniel. Yes, it was based on one comment he made making me think he wanted this breed. I, myself knew nothing about it. I really just wanted a cuddly puppy - on the chubby side - with short little legs - as I remembered out Springers to be.The reality was quite the opposite - The longest legs I have ever seen on a puppy and we soon learned our 3 acres were not enough for her, and no matter what information we got - DVD, books, etc. was not adequate to train her. She didn't bond with us and no information seemed to deal with her individual nature. Sorry - I guess I'm not evaluating the DVD. I can only say for this dog my husband did not find it helped.Amazon"
1,Not good luck with these,"I got these for my 20"" wheeled lawnmower to help protect from the frequent flats I was getting from thorns and what ever else in my lawn. I still kept getting flats often but on close inspection I saw the flats were actually little slices in the tube and they were never on the bottom but always a bit to the side where the edge of mr tuffy was sitting. After numerous flats I noticed the little slice was always where mr. tuffy overlapped itself. I believe the hard edge of the liner was actually cutting into the tube. Maybe being used on the lawnmower was too tuff on them but they simply didn't work for my purpose. I swithced to the Pyramid thorn resistant tubes and had very good results with them."
4,Good player,Good MP3 player once you get the hang of running the controls. Would recommend putting the sensitivity controls on the LEAST sensitive stting or you are always going past where you wanna be. Has done a very good job for me.
3,"Excellent player , good sound however,","the accessories are the no good. 18"" usb cable, bad for desktop placed on floor, ear plugs are no good, charging only with usb cable. Had to buy all the accessories that work good I.E. A.C. adapter, standard usb cable, hard case to hold player. If you buy plan on another $ 25-$50 for accessories...."
3,teb,"very sensitive to the touch, adjusting system does not do much. takes some getting used to.if the sensitivity were not so high, it would be easier to control. the battery does not hold a charge as long as you would like. sound is very good. software works very good, quite easy to use with Windows XP."
2,works great until........,"I've had this player for about a year and it has been working great until last week. It crashed and now is telling me there is a ""firmware problem"". I tried everything including reformating, reloading firmare, reinstalling drivers and all that and have found no solution. Then I searched online for some tips and turns out this is pretty common. Just search ""zen micro"" and ""firmware problem"" and you'll see."
1,Very Disappointed,This player was unusable. In the beginning it would freeze up and we would have to remove the battery before it would reset. After a few times even that didn't help as it would get stuck and read loading library and freeze. Eventually it wouldn't even charge up. This in only 2 weeks old.We have had a Zen Micro 4GB MP3 without the photo feature for about 2 years and have never had any problems. I suppose the photo technology has caused some glitches in the photo model. We have returned the photo MP3 for a refund and our very disappointed.
3,Great MP3 Player,"I absolutely love this MP3 player. I love the features and the touch pad especially. However, I do not like the battery and the way you charge it. The last mp3 players I have had you would use a standard AAA battery. I even bought rechargeable ones to save money. This one can only be charged through your computer using the USB plug included with player and the battery dies all of the time. I listen to it while I am at work and I need to charge it everyday. Other than my battery ""issue"", I absolutely recommend this product!!"
4,Good Little MP3,"I wanted an MP3 player and considered a number of brands but was looking for something from Creative, just not too pricy. This one offers a color screen which was a plus. The screen is a little difficult to see in some types of lighting, so consider than when deciding on this MP3. The ability to move from screen to screen is very sensitive to the touch, although you can adjust the sensitivity. You may find from time to time if you touch it too much you move very fast from screen to screen. Need to be careful with this one. I have no problem with this MP3 because I have adapted to how it works. I felt 4GB was sufficient space for the amount of music I wanted to have on the MP3. I just wanted a good basic MP3 for walking and going to the gym. Downloading of music is a snap, so you should not have any problems with this task. So far, so good, I have not experienced any major problems with this MP3."
2,not very durable,"My 14 year old son received this for xmas last year and by the summer it was broken, he really takes good care of his things so we were very disapointed. this year he's getting an ipod, my husband and I are both ipod users and after this experience I think we will remain loyal to ipod."
4,good stuff,"very good quality, it's a bit tricky to figure out how to charge at first, but once you get it, it's very easy. the touchpad adjusts sensibility so you just have to get used to that. oh yea, i bought a battery charger with mine for occassions where i am not near a computer, it was only like $4 well worth it. overall, it's a good product, in my opinion it beats an ipod with extra features and you don't have to follow the whole ""ipod fad"""
3,Question,How do you change the MP3 format to WMA? Its suppose to hold 2000 songs right? I've got about600 and have a little over 25% space left.
1,Amazingly POOR quality control ZERO STARS THUMBS DOWN!,"The data socket and/or cable on this player was of such poor quality that no connection could be made. No charge no data no detection NOTHNG! A replacement cable (mine) would charge the unit but again no data or detection. Wasted three hours of my life before sending it back to the MFR. Notice now that they are selling refurbished units which to me means tons of returns. My ""black"" unit was mainly white with a black front only. Zero stars!"
5,Great sound.... Smart price,"I did a little research before buying the Creative Zen. It's a great mp3 player, lots of capacity and great sound quality. For the price I wanted to pay (only $100, I used the $30 given by amazon), this is far the best mp3 in the market.My only complaint: bad headphone queality. They broke after a month using them."
1,OK Product - Horrible Warranty and Customer Service,"The product...Good: OLED and good sound quality.Bad: The touch pad is overly sensitive, horrible menu design. Player died after 6 months.The company...Good: Not much.Bad: Horrible warranty, ""could care less"" customer service.Don't be fooled. The warranty period is NINETY (90) DAYS!!! After 90 days you have to pay a ""diagnostic & handling fee"" which is ""at least $25"" (Creative Lab's words, not mine) regardless of the reason for putting in a warranty claim.Many other players have a ONE YEAR PARTS & LABOR warranty, anything breaks and they fix / replace the unit at NO COST.Avoid the Creative Labs ""could care less"" attitude & expense and go with the more reliable and better customer service available from Apple / iPod."
1,it was the kids,"i always wondered if mann was a truly gifted artist or if her subjects and locations were just so compelling that anyone could have captured incredible images if they happened to be present.this book confirms the latter.these photographs are flat, uninteresting, not compelling for me in any way.Maybe she needs to find some new prepubescent girls and go back to the child-erotica.The controversial nature of her images were what vaulted her to fame.it surely was not talent."
2,Uninspired,"I have great respect for Mann. Her past work has been provocative and sophisticated. This piece however, is rather uninspiring, bland, and repetitive. It seems as though she's lost much of her inspiration since her children have grown up."
1,NECRO-ART,"I was a bit disappointed as I didn't realize it was just pictures of ""Extremely Dead People"" photos. I really did not read any of the other reviews so I was a bit shocked when I opened the book. I would not purchase this book again. I thought it was something concerning life, not past life. If you are a person interested in NECRO-ART it would be of interest."
2,So-so,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer; ""The Grave"" had a promising premise, but was undermined by a weak ending; however, it is worth watching the typically strong performance by the great Lee Marvin. Unfortunately, however, this episode is paired with ""The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank"", a silly episode with James Best delivering a typically overwrought portrayal of his usual annoying cornpone clown, the sort of half-witted hayseed character which has long been his trademark. So, for optimum viewing pleasure, enjoy Lee Marvin, and fast-forward through James (""aw, shucks"") Best."
2,Lee Marvin's first role in the Zone...yipee.,"The brilliance of writer-director Montgomery Pittman enhances the first episode, which could've really soared if it hadn't bogged down in a weak finale. A twist it is but a shock it is not. ""The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank"" is a joke for the Zone, a poorly plotted and only intermittenly successful twist on funerals. If you enjoy Lee Marvin, by all means buy it. But if you don't, don't say I didn't warn you! Collectors will be the only ones interested."
1,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE,"I have been waiting for MONTHS for this company. They sent me the wrong parts to my chair, responded to my initial email fairly quickly apologizing and it has now been a month and a half with no response. It has been a nightmare dealing with this company and I hope no one else has to deal with this again. I have never had to deal with a company that does not respond when it is in the wrong."
2,Meh,The chairs are cute but the feet don't sit evenly on the ground which is annoying because they're wobbly when you sit on them. Also there was a rip in the chair cushion when I pulled it out of the box. The chairs are cute to look at but overall the quality was a disappointment.
3,Retro Chair,"These chairs are cute, but cheap. The vinyl is poor quality, and it seems I have to tighten the screws every now and then. They look good, but don't function the best."
4,Extra tracks? WHAT extra tracks?,"I think the [EXTRA TRACKS] in the title may be misleading. But ""Ballad"" is a great album, especially if you prefer the quieter, ""sensitive singer/songwriter"" side of TR."
5,One of Todd's best,"It's hard to think of an album you would want to start a non-Todd fan on, but I think this would be it. Long enough to be a treat, but short enough to where Todd doesn't get into his ""weird"" space (think Da Da Dali, which I still haven't forgiven him for). ""Chain Letter"" is loads of fun, ""The Range War"" is great to sing with friends when you're drunk (did I say drunk? I meant reading the Bible), and ""Boat on the Charles"" is so beautiful that you may not realize until later that he's singing about suicide. Every cut is wonderful, yet so different that you can barely believe they're all from the same GUY, let alone the same album. And yet, it all fits. That's the genius of Todd."
5,lilmama,"I saw this movie last night for the first time. It was hauntingly wonderful. And the music (the original score, not the country western singers)just added to the movie! I highly recommend this movie/original score..."
3,overpriced,"some of these cds have been for sale for 1 year or longer and no one has sold one because they are so expensive, like they are holding on to gold or something, they used to be 21.00 and did not sell for 2 years now we have $52.00 on here, makes no sense. A product is only worth what a person is willing to pay, not what you think it is worth, perhaps if someone started the ball rolling by lowering their price instead of going up , these would sell instead of playing I wont budge if you wont budge game"
1,terrible amp,"this amp does not put out the watts specified. way overrated. this amp will work decently with speakers, but overheats in 2 min if ran on subs."
3,"Cheaply made case was missing magnetic strip, plastic molding did not hold spare blades securely","The knives were okay, but I had to return the product since the case could not securely hold the spare blades.Box was cheap particle board with a veneer. The inside lining was cheap plastics that tears easily, cannot see it holding the knives after repeated use.The knurled metal of the knives did feel good in the hand, and the metal shaft felt well balanced when doing detail work.Skip this if you need a decent case."
5,Perfect for Carving,"This is the perfect pumpkin-carving tool set. It created a set of Game of Thrones pumpkins for Halloween. Dire Wolves and Dragons and Krakens, oh my."
5,Great Kit!,This xacto kit is great! I bought it to cut some high impact polystyrene. This product shipped to me in San Francisco in two days! Really fast ship. I am very happy.
2,"Review of ""Jennie""","It was the book I wanted but at the price charged, I was expecting a hardback. I'm sorry I didn't get an ""excellent"" paperback copy, instead of the ""pristine"" - I don't think I would have known the difference, except in the price (and I knew the cheaper ""excellent"" was a paperback). I'm sure my grandson will enjoy it, anyway, and that was the reason I ordered it"
5,A story of friendship,An amazing book about a boy who turned into a cat. The boy's hardships as a cat and his friendship with a cat named Jenni are portrayed wonderfuly.Not only for cat lovers - everyone will like this book. I don't like cats very much yet I adore it.
3,Armstrong twins steal the show,This is a good mixture of bluegrass and hillbilly styles with some likeable tracks. The Armstrong twins steal the show here though with a couple of fine tracks sung in true hillbilly style. If any one knows of any other recordings by these guys then please let me know.
1,"Customer review of ""Thank You""","The DVDs are in good condition and the vedio is good but the English subtitle is horrendously bad. The character's name changes from one DVD to the next. The English translation of the character's conversation is total different from what's received via TV. The beauty of the story ""Thank You"" is lost in English translation of these DVDs I received. I am very unhappy with this purchase. I have rented tapes of ""Thank You"" from rental store and enjoyed it very much."
4,Important reading,"Author would do better if he was not so repetitive. Still it is worth reading as one realizes that Islamic Terrorism is not a new thing starting in recent years, but has deep historical antecedents."
2,Please Stop the Lies,"Why? the Lies? Why the continual lies?? Hitler KNEW that the Jews were going to migrate to Palestine! Really??Oh yeah, he had a contact in the mid East that set up all of the hate and killing that Israeli is committing today. Yeah. it was Hitler, nobody else but..Isn't it strange: the hatred, greed, and destruction that seems to follow Europeans where ever they migrate and attempt to dominate.What world continent has not experienced the mayhem that follows the migration of the white man???Was this written in Disney's studios or the fiction lodge?"
1,"Review MSD Ignition 31259 WiresetSuprcond Ford2300 """,I bought this set for a 2003 ford Ranger 2.3 DOHC four cyl. It was listed to fit this model. They have the wrong ends for the coil ( mine are the european contact style )they are for early four bangers. They (MSD) told me they don't make them and it was not their fault. They did seem willing to work with me and would send the correct ends. But at the time they didn't make them. I bet they would send me two more ( same type ) and then I could use them on my 1985 S-10 2.8 V6. I will contact them again and see what we can work out. If not who else makes a 8.5 spiral wound wire Heli-Core (high end)for a 2003 ford Ranger 2.3 DOHC four cyl.?
3,mezzo mezzo,"The search for a great sequel is, in truth, a rather fruitless one. When has ""part II"" ever stood up to the original, especially when the original is Jane Austen? Nevertheless, I took comfort on a grey afternoon reuniting with Elizabeth and Darcy and enjoyed meeting their three children, Fitzwilliam, Henry, and Jane. Diana Birchall's quickly moving story will neither excite awe nor a re-read, but she does a fine job of bringing all the social drama of Longbourn, Pemberley, and Rosings back to our lives. She even manages to weave in a bit of Mansfield Park into her plot line.All in all, an enjoyable, quick read for an Austen fanatic."
3,Dilemma Anti-Climax,"While the book depicted the characters from Pride & Prejudice accurately and threaded them through the plot with the gratification of their characters reacting somewhat true to form, I found no highs or lows worth being in a dilemma over. People got hurt, people got married, folks visited and it was all presented rather matter-of-factly. I didn't hate it but its not a ""I'm going to read that again someday book, either."" To a great degree, I think its oversold, both in price and content."
2,Is this supposed to be a novel??,"I can't believe none of the other reviewers have commented on the fact that this book is comprised of 240 pages of very large print! It is more like a long short-story than a novel. I was disappointed. I guess I can donate it to the nursing home (the elderly will appreciate the large print)!The author did manage to portray Lydia and her two daughters in a semi-amusing manner, but Lizzy and Darcy lacked that certain zing that I expect of their characters. The writing style is similar to Jane Austen's, but I definitely wasn't impressed overall. Bottom-line, the book was short and fairly boring."
1,Boring and unlikeable.,"I finished the book because I am incapable of not doing so however, I did find it boring and its characters unlikable. There were also many spelling, format and grammatical errors. For me to have noticed at all, they must have been blatant."
1,Worst sequel I ever read!,This book violates the characters characteristics so badly that it is offensive. This book is Terrible. Of the 15 sequels I have read to Pride and prejudice this book is BY FAR THE WORST! DON'T BUY IT!
1,Perfectly Terrible,"I am in complete shock that this book has received such an excellent rating from other Austen fans. I thought it was absolutely terrible. ""Excellently mimics the language, the structure, and the dialog of an Austen novel""?? Has this person read a Jane Austen novel? I felt that the author strained at every turn to sound ""Austenesque"" while never actually achieving it. And as for the plot, it was nothing short of contrived and trite. There was no clever weaving of the story line, no intricate details, no anything that is deserving of so many stars for an Austen sequel. Don't be fooled!"
4,An enjoyment!,"I really enjoyed this book. It was very well done. I loved the way the characters spoke to one another. The story line was a little perdictable and the whole mistress thing was a little awkward but I really was entertained. Elizabeth wasn't as spunky as she was known to be in P&P but she is a grown woman with grown children so her character would change I'm sure. Anyway, if you are contemplating this book, just do it. It is worth the time."
4,LOVE this product!,"I know it's used for the neck of the saxophone, but I also use it to clean out the mouthpiece as well and it's fabulous. It is a little bigger than the neck so I can't place it in my case properly, but I have the matching body saver in the same color, so it works!"
5,Just as expected,I needed this product for my son's saxophone. The product is holding up to daily abuse and is easy to use.
5,sax accessories,"Ordered this for my sons sax, to help keep it clean and dry, it works great, came in a very timely manner."
2,X Men in the Year 2099,I got the much sought after first issue of X Men 2099 because I found it for really cheap. The X Men mythos is also adapted into the the now defunct Marvel comics 2099 world that sees classic characters in the year 2099. X Men is like the third best 2099 title behind Spider Man at number one and Doom at number 2. These sees some forgettable characters that don't have the depth and compassion of even Cyclops or Jubilee. Worth checking out for those who got these 2099s when they first came out. Wouldn't recommend this first issue unless you want to make X Men 2099 YOUR comic.
2,Not effective enough!,"I have seborrheic dermatitis and tried this for about 2 months. It doesn't work as well as a sulfur shampoo (now I make my own). I was still left with an itchy scalp. Also, this was drying to the hair. Definitely need a conditioner afterwards."
3,Supposedly this helps and or cures scalp Rosacea.,"I have been using for some months and I cannot state that it is really worth the additional price. While, it does take down the skin irritation and inflammation, real Pine Tar Soap accomplishes about the same and it is half the price.Although the scent of Pine Tar Soap, does put people off, the soap cleans and sterilizes the Rosacea issues just as well as the DHS shampoo. There is no cure or understanding of scalp rosacea, so any type of shampoo that does not dry out the scalp too much or cover it with oils.I have found that the DHS does clear up the excess scalp oil, the itchiness and the inflammation. Only with continuous useage, do these issues improve."
5,Great for psoriasis,"I used to itch like crazy. It was very embarrassing, but then someone told me to try a zinc shampoo and it has saved my sanity."
4,When Love Looks For U,"Jake McKenna never knew that love would find her in a body of 6'2, prestigous lawyer who just happens to own a magainze ""HER BOSS that is."" She has become the sole provider for her six year old niece and is determine to prove to everyone that she can care for her and this child. Eamon Fitzgerald is determine to make her see the growing attraction even if it means demanding her way into her life.A personal crisis brings them toghether when Eamon uses everything he knows to convience Jake that he passion that they have is nothing she can fight."
1,Shipping charges out of sight!!!,"I was going to order about $10.00 worth of refills and erasers, but the shipping charge was $36! Too much for an order that weighs less than a pound."
1,Price. Yikes!,"This item is a single tube containing 2 eraser refills.A single tube. The price of this single tube is $1.09 at Office Depot. I know, right?The photo dazzled me, and the product shows a list price of $16.08. $16.08 surely would be the price of a full box. I've used these erasers in the past, so I didn't read the ""Product Features"". My greedy self clicked the ""buy"" button without further question.At the time of my purchase, the price I paid was $4.00."
3,Beware!,"This purchase is for only 1 tube of 2 erasers (as the description says). It is not for a box of refills(as the picture shows). For just two erasers, the price is extremely expensive. The erasers themselves are excellent and get 5 stars, but the misleading picture and cost drops the rating to 3."
3,Picture is misleading,Picture makes it seem like you're going to get a whole box of erasers. Actual product is just two erasers. The description is correct but the picture should be changed.
5,Amazing,"Thank you so much, the erasers are perfect. I'm very happy with the seller, the transaction was fast and smooth. I got the product actually 4 days before the estimated delivery dates. very nice"
5,"Johnny Rivers ""Rhino"" Anthology","I know JR put out his own 2 CD Anthology in 2006, which I have, but this is THE set from Rivers to have, as many of his takes on great songs do not appear on the 2006 set. Great songs, great sound, and for a guy that had his last big hit nearly 35 years ago, he still puts on a GREAT live show, doing a lot of songs from the Rhino CD set. I'd say this may the best ""Greatest Hits"" (that represents the artist well) cd set I have, and I have many. Great singer, great guitar player!"
2,"Disappointed in the product, delighted with the customer service",I ordered two of these screens. They both arrived damaged and I was disappointed with the quality of the screens. There are very light weight and the wicker is easily damaged. I was however delighted with the way my concerns were addressed and resolved. I will not hesitate to purchase from this supplier in the future.
2,Less than 1 month and problems already-edited 11-11-07,"Really nice register. As with most, programming, though relatively easy, is time consuming. Now, however, the time has reset twice in 2 weeks. Customer support says to fix problem, unplug and remove batteries --which means all memory will be lost. Like I have a couple of spare hours to re-program...I regret this purchase. In shopping for this one, I saw a Sharp which you could program from your computer. Although it costs about $100 more, the time saved in re-programming would have probably been worth it.Great features--just a pain in the butt too soon after purchase.Edit: We replaced the batteries and have had no problems in the almost 2 years we have had this. My suggestion: don't use the enclosed batteries-use your own fresh batteries! We didn't unplug to replace the batteries, so did not lose the memory."
3,It's ok,"Simply put, this game is fun but not worth the money.Why?The game is short. I beat it in two days. Although it is fun to play, it is pretty easy to beat.The graphics are good but not great. Although all the original actors do the voices, the characters look nothing like them. All the women look manly and the men look ugly.Enemy AI is pretty bad. All you have to do (for the most part) is crawl on the ceiling and you can walk right past all the bad guys.The only fights that are good are the boss fights. Every other bad guy that you fight goes down in 3 hits. Even the boss fights can get really repetitious and boring sometimes.In conclusion, just rent this game. It is not worth it to own especially when you can easily beat it within a week."
3,Fun but gets boring over time. Not worth $50,Spiderman 2 is a big disapointment. I just bought a PSP and then got Spiderman 2. The game is defintly not worth 50 bucks. i beat the game in less thatn 2 hours on normal. The trainig is bad and the camera just sucks. The bosses are all the same. Break a shield or make him dizzy and then hit him. No big deal. The game had 19 levels but each level lasted like 5 minutes. Gets really boring . Don't buy it unless you really like spiderman. if u don't but still want the gaem rent. Not Worth 50 bucks.
3,FUN... but really really short...,"I bought this game for my PSP about a month ago (and I'm actually selling it tonight) and popped it into my PSP. I played through about 3/4 of it that night and the other small bit the next night... then it was over... I was kinda like, ""So that's it?"". There is absolutely nothing wrong with the game except that it is terribly short and has no redeaming value... this makes me sad... playing it a second time is just boring and not as fun as the first and there is no kind of multiplayer or really that many unlockables (just three galleries of stuff)... I would recomend this for hardcore Spidey fans (like myself) that have big bags of money that can be spent willy-nilly. Other than that... just rent/borrow it somewhere, you won't be dissapointed if you do that."
3,More like Spiderman 1.5,"If you enjoyed Spiderman 2 for the PS2 and your thinking ""Cool I loved that game, and now I can take it anywhere"" think again. Gone is the open environment where you can spend hours just swinging around Manhattan. Instead its one level right after another. Its like they to the first Spiderman game and updated the content to reflect the new movie. Its almost deceptive for fans of Spiderman 2 for the PS2. And the worst part is they didn't even get Bruce Campbell to do the voice for the tutorial."
2,Well...,"This was the first game I got for my PSP about 2 years ago, and quite frankly, I was disapointed. I thought it would be like the free-roaming game in the PS2 version, but it can't even compare to the first spiderman. Gameplay is a lot like spiderman 1, You go in a level, beat up some people, peter says something funny, you're on to the next level. However, I was not deterred. Don't get me wrong, this game is great, that is, until you beat it. I havn't picked it up in about 16 months. Beating the game again on hard, but its not very satisfying and definetely has low replay value. About 2 1/2 stars."
2,Way Too Short!,"This Game is Awesome! The controls are easy and you can find everything you want in a video game in this game. Only one problem, it's too short. I beat in a hour. Too bad, but it's stinks. This is a great game to rent, not buy!"
5,A Marvelous and Thought-Provoking CD!,"This CD inspires you to think. The delicacy and gentleness of the instruments lulls you and gives you a feeling of comfort and safety. It makes you think back to childhood. For me, I think about being a small child and being snug in bed with my mother, reading ""Goodnight Moon"" and ""Love You Forever"", two books that mean a lot to both of us. This CD brings back fond memorys. Exceptionally good calming music or music to fall asleep with. One of the songs I recommend is ""Here comes the Sun"". A beautiful CD, everyone should own it!"
1,Proselytizing!,"I was so disappointed to see the beloved Scooby characters commandeered and used to promote a religious agenda! What a farce! If you want your kids to absorb a one-sided Wiccan view of the Wicca religion, let them see this film. But if you want a good, funny, Scooby laugh, SKIP THIS PROPAGANDA PIECE!!!"
1,Scooby Doo and the Witches,"A big Animated commercial for witches and wicans, stick to the old scooby doos which featured mysterys, not the occult. When Thelma looks at the camera and talks about missunderstood wicans you know your in trouble."
1,"How to raise your kid to be a good witch, I kid you not!","Are your children boring and drab? Do they lie around and do nothing at all? Then buy them Scooby Doo and the Witch's Ghost and they soon will learn a new pagan religion! They will learn that Wiccans are holy and pure practioners of ''natural herb medicine'' and that while they are witches, they are white witches and that makes them good! Seriously, this is a sad, propeganda flick for the Wiccan Witchcraft religion. If I can't be any blunter, this is a pro-Witch flick, I kid you not! Now I know some people see the devil hiding under every rock and nook and cranny. I know it could be easy to dismiss what I say as the writings of someone with those seniments. But I kid you not, this flick actually promotes the Wiccan religion. If you are Christian, Jewish or Islamic, do yourself a favor, avoid this video. It's one you do not want your kids seeing."
1,Unbelievable-Pro Wiccan,"I was in the other room doing dishes while my son watched this movie for the first time. I bought it in the $5 section of a local department store.I thought I kept hearing the words Wicca, Wiccan...nature...good witches...and things along that line and I was blown away. Then came the so-called explanation of Wicca and how Wiccans are largely misunderstood. I sat down to watch and tried to stay with it for another 20 minutes or so but I just could not sit there and let my 3 year old soak this in.This movie glamorizes and sexualizes Wicca. I can't say much about the plot because we only made it about half way through before it got thrown in the trash. I've read the other reviews and am glad I took it out when I did. Deeply disappointed that Scooby is endorsing Wicca."
1,too much propoganda...,The themes presented in this Scooby Doo movie are not at all age appropriate for the targeted audience. What I used to love about Scooby Doo is that the monsters were never real and in the end the mystery was solved. I wish I had pre-screened this one before letting my 5 y.o. watch it. Bad decision on my part. I'd love to see them put as much Christian propaganda into a Scooby Doo movie as the pro-wiccan propaganda featured in this film.
1,"KPepper2, Please","I am at a loss as to how you can say the movie doesn't promote Wicca. I mean, did we watch the same movie? Characters in the movie are Wiccan, the Wiccan religion is explained in quite detail and the end song embodies all that was explained about that <cough> religion. HELLO?????The movie is more Warner Brothers, New Ageism, Wicca GARBAGE. It falls right in line with Harry Potter and has no endearing qualities about it whatsoever. It's propoganda aimed at conditioning your little one's mind to accepting withcraft and new ageism. Steer clear."
5,Wonderful,My friend and I rented It(were both Ten). We both liked it... and her mom(she was their)also enjoyed it.My mom has seenit before when I watched it on cartoon network.I've also seen Scoobydoo on vombie Island. END
1,Scooby Doo teaching my children Wicca----Really?????,"I found this totally inappropriate. I guess it's my fault for not reading the back of the dvd, but I didn't expect to have a Scooby-Doo movie attempt to educate my 3 and 5 year old about any religion."
1,Too scary and freaky,"My kids usually love the Scooby Doo shows and movies. However, this movie was far too scary for them. I am not a prude. I have no problem with the movie's references to Wican religion. And generally I don't have problems with stories/movies featuring witchcraft or magic, such as Harry Potter. However, the real witch that appears near the middle of this movie is very scary and the storyline gets freaky. It is a full reversal from the other Scooby Doo mysteries always ending with a logical explanation for all the things that have happened in the show(i.e. robots or a person in costume). We watched this once and threw it in the garbage."
4,Scooby Doo Meets a New England Ghost Witch!!!!!!!,"The gang is back and this time they're investigating a small New England town's spectral visitor, the ghost of a long ago persecuted witch. Spooky happenings, excessive eating, Scooby Snacks and of course the Ghost make this a worthwhile purchase for every Scooby fan. There are also a couple of plot twists to keep even the most seasoned Scooby veteran guessing. A rocking soundtrack accompanies all the Scooby and Shaggy antics, as well as the chase scenes. If you like this movie check out Scooby Doo on Zombie Island which is far scarier and an even better movie. A nice treat for Scooby fans!"
4,"Good movie, a bit scary for little ones","I don't have a problem with this movie. True it is not like the classic Scooby-Doo cartoons but it does include all the characters unlike the Boo Brothers. The only thing that I really did not like about this movie and Zombie Island is that is is kind of scary for very young children. My three year-old son is a big fan of Scooby-Doo and when he sees this movie and Zombie Island he keeps repeating the phrase ""monsters aren't real they're just pretend"". So it is a little bit scary but like all the others they have good endings and are lots of fun."
4,Scooby is still good,I remember this movie from when I was a little younger and I have it on VHS so I decided to get on DVD. It's good quality and Scooby is still funny the ghost in this one is actually real which is different than people may expect. Still enjoy it and my 2 1/2 year old did as well. It's not scary in my opinion.
2,Sound could be better.,"The sound quality for this videotape is not that great. Not what you would expect from a new video. Kind of scratchy, like it's used and had been used often."
2,Not for children under 8 & not your typical Scooby-Doo,"As a 35 yr old Mom of two children under six, we are all avid Scooby fans. This new Scooby & Gang movie only survived one viewing in our home. It's theme and guest characters are much darker than in movies/shows of Scooby's past. As a huge fan of Tim Curry, he is a great villain in the movie, but a little too villainous for the under eight set. The witch is super scary compared to previous villains. Also, the ""Hex Girls"" are scantily clad and have a Wiccan sex-kitten thing goin' on that is a little over the top for children. The ""Hex Girls"" make being a teenage Wiccan look really cool. Our children will be really excited when I bring this video out of hiding again - in about 5-7 years.There are many other great Scooby Doo movies to choose from if your children are under eight years old. Hope this helps!"
2,"Too scary for younger kids, odd storyline","This isn't nearly as good as the other Scooby films. It is darker and scarier and our young child who has no trouble with other Scooby shows was frightened in several spots, including the opening scene where the bad guys come after the gang with axes. And, as you know from other reviews, the witch is real and both she and the main human bad guy die in the end when they are entrapped inside a magic book which is then burned.The Wicca stuff is more distracting than alarming and it's handled so confusingly there's no way anybody is going to be converted by this movie. However, they took so much time pointlessly trying to explain the differences between the good Wiccans, the evil witch, and the girl band members who just pretend to be Wiccan to sell more albums, that it detracts from the story. This is a comedy and exposition is never funny. So why is it crammed into a story that was already bloated? Perhaps the gang can solve that mystery in a future adventure."
2,"Good potential, but horribly flawed","The idea for this movie certainly had promise, and it's not like the idea (what would Scooby-Doo be like if the monsters were real?) couldn't be successful--Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island is clearly enjoyable. However, despite some strong points (the major plot twist isn't bad, and Tim Curry is better than memorable until overacting ruins it near the end), the plot drags in the middle and the big climax could have used some of the time the middle didn't need.Also, there's a big build-up to the song the Hex-Girls (the Wiccan band mentioned in a few other reviews) are going to perform, and the show makes the mistake of having them actually perform it at the end. The song alone is bad enough that it moves me from not being sure whether to give this movie two or three stars to making it clear that it doesn't deserve more than two.If you want to get one of these new Scooby-Doo movies, skip this one and get Zombie Island instead."
4,Lighten Up!,"This is just a movie about a talking dog and his teen-agedetective pals! How many people out there actually think your childmight sacrifice the neighbors kitty to the Dark Forces Of Evil on the basis of something he/she saw in a cartoon? For the rest of you- fun movie, a little short, not as good as 'Zombie Island', I still don't like the new voices they're using for Daphne & Velma (they sound alike), and the animation is not as good as the groovy-retro-early '70's style of the original cartoon but what is? Positively recommended for past, present, and future Scooby fans!"
3,Oddly teachable moment,"The references to Wicca in this little movie allowed us to talk about different religions with our kids. We are an atheist household living in a society that is pretty well soaked in Judeo-Christian references, and so this was a fun way to bring up some of the minority points of view.I do not view it as propaganda anymore than the countless references to churches and other common elements of our world. To those who are believers of one sort or another and are concerned that kids may be negatively impacted, relax. It would seem hard to imagine that one episode of Scooby-Doo would undo centuries of cultural influence. I am sure your kids are smarter than that.The world is large and contains all sorts - including stoners with talking dogs, apparently :-)"
1,If I could give if 0 stars I would!,"I cannot even put into words how inappropriate this video is. The ghosts/monsters are real, the movie is essentially a pro-wiccan commercial, and the story is so scary/evil. I went back to the store where it was purchased and warned the customer service manager of the content. I knew I couldn't return it but I wanted to let them know how disappointed I was..apparently so many other families had the same issue I had that they had removed it from the shelves!!!! I have never contacted a corporation before to complain but I did this time...with no response...maybe Hanna Barbera/Warner is too ashamed to respond!!"
5,Another Great Scooby Movie!!!!!,"Thank you Warner Brothers for another great adventure with scooby in the gang! Usually sequels suck. (Yes, I consider the a sequel to Zombie Island) This one definitly does the series justice. I am happy to see that the gang has not only matured but so have the plot lines! As far as the Wiccan References are concerned, I am happy that Earth Religions are starting to get rid of some of the evil superstitions associated with them. Bravo Warner for teaching people to not be so prejudiced! Blessed be to all and have a great Halloween!!!"
4,My Four-Year Old is Under a Hex Girl's Spell,"My 30-year old husband and four-year old son are both big Scooby fans-- both the classic and the new updates. In this modern-era movie, the gang is out to reveal the mystery behind Oakville's witches ghost, and find they are facing more than just one witch. But is it really a witch? Modern touches are added with a band of girls whose gimmick is ""witchery"" with fangs and black lipstick-- but they're ""just eco-goths."" Yes, one character is Wiccan which is like saying one character is a Shaman. There is nothing cultish or evil to shield your young ones from. And no, I'm not a Wiccan.Nice references to the classics galore: it helps to be in on the jokes. My dad wouldn't find this charming or amusing but we do. My kid loves Daphne and sings one of the Hex Girls' songs.And Amazon: his name's Fred, *not* Frank. And it's ""***meddling*** kids""!"
1,pretty lame,"At the risk of someone saying ""lighten up lady"" I have to agree with the old school one star folks on this one. The memories I have of Scooby Doo definitely differ from this movie. Its blatantly pro-Wiccan premise is, frankly, weird. I think I would think that any religious context in a Scooby Doo movie is weird. The fun and entertainment value of Scooby was the innocent mystery solving almost by happenstance. The resolution was typically a ruse- no one actually had powers, let alone demonic ones. Yeah generic witches are fine, but glorfying a pagan religion- just not Scooby. Go for a video with the vintage characters and story lines- kids love that, and so do parents. I watched it before my kids so I avoided the ""teachable moment"" other higher star reviewers seemed to value."
3,Witch's Ghost -- Okay,"After seeing Zombie Island -- couldn't wait for this to come out. Finally saw it.. Not as good as Zombie Island -- took 1/2 of the story to get interesting. Very action packed towards the end but am not dying to see it again where Zombie my 4 year old and I were watching every weekend.Also, I'm reviewing these for my 4 yr. old son. Zombie -- he loved it until my older son (13) spooked him, then he went thru a scared time - then when I convinced him it was pretend it is back to being his favorite. Witches was ok by him."
3,"Not Scooby's Best, But Still Good","Perhaps if I had not seen ""Scooby Doo On Zombie Island,"" I would have given this 4 stars. I feel this is a real good movie. The images are well done and the content of the story has a historical background. Twists and turns are well placed. The music is memorable, the comedy is cute, and the action is well done. My only complaint is that this doesn't seem to have the superb organization, suspense, and shocks of ""Scooby Doo On Zombie Island."" As I said on my ""Scooby Doo on Zombie Island"" review, I admire Scooby's ability to create a scarey movie without sacrificing character development, without going way beyond the line of plausibility, and being able to create suspense and fear without extreme graphics. I give him 1/2 box of Scooby Snacks for this film, and a whole box for ""Scooby Doo On Zombie Island."""
1,Disappointed,"Classic Scooby Doo - ALWAYS - ALWAYS - exposed the creature, monster or mystery as a fraud. I couldn't believe that a story intended for young audiences included: a warlock, Wicca, real witches casting spells to make trees and pumpkins come to life - to throw balls of lightening, and to bound a spirit into spell book. Hello? What happened to the part where they ALWAYS pulled the mask off and explained to our young viewers how the candle in the window was rigged or the footprints were made by scubba diving fins! I knew a lot had changed since I was a kid - but I was still very saddened to learn that Scooby-Doo is no longer fit for children to watch."
1,"Because I cannot return it, I will throw it away.","If the movie would have ended when they caught the people who were spooking the town, I might have kept it. (because even though I thought it was not up to par, my kids were enjoying it) But, when it turned from a simple mystery into a battle with a conjured-up, ""real"", scarey spirit, my kids and I decided it must go."
5,Blew my mind,They opened for a band that honestly I can't even remember (the Alarm?). All I remember was how blown away I was by two guys standing very alone on the stage rocking the place down.I immediately bought the album and even now over 20 years later it's still one of my favorite albums. There is something sublime about the turn of the lyric and the raw energy of the songs on here.I wish I had the words to express how much I enjoy their music.
2,New CD,The group ar new to hip hop and are very experimental. they make some good beats but they arent catchy enough to make this album worth while. They have talent but they need exposure and listeners before they go anywhere.
5,Psychological and Alchemical Gold,"The heart of this book is ten ancient alchemical recipes. Cavalli interprets this recipes in terms of Jungian psychology, showing how they can be used to transform the ordinary elements of everyday life into gold. Until reading ""Alchemical Psychology,"" while I was intrigued by alchemy, I was also confused by the esoteric imagery. Cavalli's clear explanations and practical advice have shown me a path for using this perennial wisdom in my own process of integrating my psyche, creating alchemical gold!Every time I return to this book, I find something new, both in the text and in the beautiful reproductions of alchemical woodcuts."
2,I wanted to like this book,"I really did want to like this book. It held the promise of demystifying alchemy and applying it to my psychological growth. Unfortunately, I found it sorely lacking in practical applications, exercises, etc. It was also very disorganized, printed on extremely cheap paper and throws in cross-cultural references to Zen Buddhism. Excuse me, but I wanted a book on Western esotericism, not Eastern. ..."
5,"Brilliant! Elegant, concise, astute, and provocative.","This book was assigned in my ""Introduction to Theater"" class, and I found myself highlighting sentence after sentence. This book offers a very unique appreciation of theater, dwelling on theater's combination of fantasy and reality. You can read through this book in an afternoon, but you will want to return to it again and again."
2,Cadillac Jack Runs out of Gas,"Surprisingly, master storyteller Larry McMurtry (Lonesome Dove, Terms of Endearment) has written a book with virtually no plot. Cadillac Jack describes a month or so in the life of an antiques dealer on the road. In Jack's world, all people are eccentrics with funny names like Pencil Penrose and Sir Cripps Crisp, and all women he finds attractive are willing to sleep with him at the drop of a hat. Set in the pre-AIDS era, the book reflects a cavalier attitude about sexual responsibility that may appall late 1990's sensibilities. Nevertheless, Cadillac Jack is amusingly written, especially when it describes the bizarre and wonderful antiques that are the real objects of Jack's passion. Not bad, but compared to McMurtry's epic works, Cadillac Jack has a flat tire."
3,"Well written and funny, but the plot lacked juice.","I couldn't put this book down...until the last couple of chapters when I felt cheated out of a real end or conclusion or...anything. I needed closure. I laughed out loud at McMurtry's descriptions and characterization. I could see each object the main character sought to own, whether it be a salt shaker or a woman, but I just couldn't see the end of the tale and was bitterly let down."
5,When offered a coffeecup do not expect to find a beer inside,"These are the words of our classic Anton Chekhov. Does McMartry advertise Cadillac Jack as another Terms of Endearment? Why it's wrong to be entertained and ask yourself - So what?- when the book is finished? The book is funny,unpretentious and concise. I made myself finish Moving On, dropped all these prequels & sequels to Lonesome Dove and Terms of Endearment halfway through, gasping at McMurtry's productivity, enjoyed his Pulitzer Prize winner and the book the Oscar winner is based on. But it's the books like Cadillac Jack and Anything For Billy that gave me a few precious hours of enjoyment and relaxation. They are well above the mass market fare but they do not plan to enter the Booker's shortlist, perfectly satisfied with being what they are."
3,Amusing,"Not a novel of grand scope as are many of McMurtry's best, but entertaining anyway. Interesting characters and some good jokes."
1,book condition,"Book should have been new but book received must have been used. Front cover bent, corners worn & bent, edges worn,some pages same condition. Just a paper back but still disappointed."
5,Priveleged to get a preview,I had the recent priveledge to preview this album. Allen Clapp's musical talent is incredible. The music is upbeat and fun. It is a shame that the west coast is the only place that really gets to enjoy this band.
3,Red Lantern,"Lamplight 52664 Farmer's Lantern, BlackWorks fine. I didn't have any problems with the globe lift lever mentioned as a problem by another reviewer. It does need some way to measure the amount of fuel, but for a lantern this inexpensive, one should not expect added features. I did find the same lantern at Wal-Mart for $5.98 + tax; however, I like to sit at home and order from Amazon."
2,NOT a TOY!,"Have several other of these and they are sturdier and ""controls"" work much more smoothly. Tank is smaller on these. Will do in a pinch. Will use these with citronella oil as I have others in the Spring through Fall.I'll buy the local ones next time."
1,You get what you pay for....,"First of all I'm not sure why Amazon has these lanterns listed as toys!! They are not toys!! I bought two of these lanterns for camping and the occasional power outage. When I first took them out of the box could tell immediately they were cheaply made. I was not happy with the quality at all. I put kerosene in one to try it and when I moved the lever to raise the glass globe to light the wick, the lever bent. I threw them both away and ordered 2 quality Dietz Lanterns. I guess you get what you pay for...."
1,Typical Made in China crap,"Only got this because it was cheap and was buying wicks. It's a piece of crap, ton's of overspray and missing paint spots. If anything I use the globe on my as a replacement for my Dietz lantern."
1,NO HELP,"two of the lanters had broken globs and i can not buy replaement globes , i called rothco and they said thy could not help me , he said GOOD LUCK and hung up."
2,Cheap and made in China,"Very cheaply made and can only hold a small amount of kerosene. If I would have known about where it was made, I never would have bought it."
1,leaking all over the place,don't buy this item had to return them because both where leaking made in china they don't care should have known when we say the price oh well better luck next time .
5,Not a toy,"Why amazon has this listed as a TOY I don't know. I don't let my kids play with fire.Other than the miscategorization, this lantern is decent for the price. I wanted to note that the 1/2"" wick is the size it comes with, for those wondering which wick is needed."
5,"Great lantern, great price.","LOTS of similar products cost a lot more. I bought 4. This was just what I wanted for patio table lighting for dinner on the patio. I love the red, adds a nice pop to our patio's overall look. I have NO idea why Amazon is asking me Qs about it as if it's a toy?? So you can ignore that I think it's 5 stars of ""fun"" or ""educational,"" unless dinner on the otherwise dark patio is fun, and learning to light the lantern is educational..."
1,This is not worth it,"I never even got it lit. I filled it with kerosene and gave it an hour to allow the wick time to absorb the kerosene. I put the lantern in a tray and when I came back the tray was filled with kerosene (it had a small hole in the bottom). I pulled out the second one I ordered, same problem. I got what I paid for, I will buy quality next time."
1,Nothing special,I bought this product and use it for a month but still I don't feel its pore minimizing effect. I have visible pores on cheeks and nose (its common for oily and combination skin) and this mask didnt help me. Moreover if you have allergy on tea tree oil I can't recommend this product. It has a strong smell of that oil.
3,Good Spot Treatment but Didnt Notice any Pore Shrinkage,"I love the Kiss My Face Potent and Pure Products, but I couldn't really tell a difference when I used this. I only tried using it 1-2 times a week, so maybe more frequent use would help? It does make a really good spot treatment though. If I feel a blemish coming and apply some to it before bed, it is usually gone the next morning. A blemish that's made it to the surface and has been lingering a little longer (or that I've been picking at and irritating further) is drastically reduced and then tends to go away after the 2nd night using as a spot treatment. In general with the other Kiss My Face products I have very few breakouts."
1,burn!,I tried once last night and it burnt my face in 5 seconds! It didn't feel right and I don't like it at all!
3,Nice Product,"I like this mask, but I only gave it 3 stars because it doesn't do what it says it does. My pores are still the same size as before. If you are looking for just a regular mask then it's great but if your looking to minimize your pores try something else."
3,"Okay product, but didn't do all I was hoping for...","I used the whole tube before reviewing, to be sure I gave it a chance. It does a fine job cleansing, although it does leave my skin a bit dry. I didn't notice that it diminished the appearance of my pores, though, no matter how long I used it. If that is what you are looking for in a product, it might be better to try something else!"
5,"Uncle ""Pee Wee"" Crayton: one of my 1st inspirations...","Uncle ""Pee Wee"" Crayton brought enough ""heat"" and daring innovation to his playing that inspired a generation of ""Ax-Men"" to follow for years to come... This CD only completes 1/2 the collection, you have to include Modern Legacy, Vol. 2: Blues Guitar Magic CD to see where I am coming from, do you feel the blues yet?For any blues music lover, the Modern Legacy, Vol. 1 CD is a must have!--""Big Dave"" Burleigh an 'AmeriCanadian' Record Producre/ Artist/ Singer-Songwritre."
4,Beano liquid,the products arrived on time and was just as expected.The liquid beano is not available anywhere except online.I was happy to find it at this time.
4,Excellent but disappointing,My wife and I bought the soundtrack after seeing the movie. We bought it expecting to hear all the performance (nightclub) pieces. The album only contains the background orchestration i.e. driving through the countryside etc. The album is excellent music and well produced. I only wish it was complete with ALL the music
5,I can still love God without pretending I'm an air head,"This book is an awesome indepth study of where the traditions of society have been layed on Women as God's commandments. I personally found it comforting to know that there are other christian women who are struggling with this battle. Sometimes are church services sound more like a meeting of ""The He-man Woman Haters Club"" (As the Little Rascals called themselves.) I think this book should be read be any female christian or non-believer to help all of us understand why MAN believes what he believes and what God actually did and did not say. I really am impressed with this book and I don't impress easily.Happy Reading."
2,Great Music. The Vocals? Not So Much.,"Terrific instrumental performances featuring a well-chosen selection of early jazz and blues tunes from Memphis, the band's hometown. The musical arrangements are also wonderful. The problem? The vocals are terrible.For the most part, the singing is crude and without charm. It undercuts everything the band achieves musically. A competent vocalist would have saved this project, but as is, this is largely unlistenable. It's too bad, because I can tell these guys love this music."
2,Misleading discription,"The description given for this edition is not correct. It is not the Prestwick House Literary Touchstone Edition, and therefore does not include a glossary, notes or any extras. There are also several type-o's throughout. If I had known, this would not have been my first choice."
2,Just as boring as in high school,"I read this for a school project and I have to say I have never been a fan of Greek Tragedy. The Kindle edition was fine and easy to read and the annotations helped very much, but the story itself just isn't my thing. I'll leave it at that."
4,"Concise, graceful translation","This play asks timeless moral questions. We had a 2 hour discussion on it, and left wanting to say more. This translation was much clearer and less wordy than some of the others the group had with them."
2,"Good transaction, not so good translation.","I ordered this book for an English class. It was disappointing to me to find it a very different translation than everyone else. While reading the book, The text seemed oversimplified.The transaction was smooth and the book arrived without flaw."
5,reliable product,"I shopped several places in town for xacto. Craft and hardware. They carriedc cheaper brands which did not meet my needs and did not last. Knew I could find them online. Very pleased. Will not need new for several years, I am sure. Purchased dependability!MJ"
4,Cut like an exacto knife.,"It cuts like an exacto knife. It didnt fall apart like the other one I had, not made out of cheap material so thats good. I would buy another one."
4,A soong Is Born,This is another super DVD musical comedy of Danny Kaye & Virgina Mayo.Their chemistry and acting talents are outstanding and joyous.Louis Armstrong and Benny Goodman exemplified first rate musical talents.Don't miss this one!
5,excellent product,"I am very happy wth my purchase, which arrived in a very timely manner and in excellent condition."
2,Disappointing,"I had seen the Five Pennies which is also a jazz movie starring Danny Kaye and it was so good I was hoping for more of the same. I was very disappointed with this film--barely made my way through it and promptly gave it away. Don't waste your money on this one, but if you are a jazz enthusiast check out Five Pennies with Danny Kaye, Barbara Bel Geddes and Louis Armstrong. It's excellent."
2,jazz numbers are the only reason to see this Ball of (mis)FIre,"A tiresome remake of the tiresome comedy Ball of Fire, in which itself was a play of sorts on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. In the original, Barbara Stanwyck loosened up the uptight professor Gary Cooper. In the remake (both were helmed by Howard Hawks), Virginia Mayo puts some shimmy into professor Danny Kaye. That's a serious downgrade in both roles. The only reason anyone cares about this version is the fact that Kaye is ""researching"" jazz so we get to see great performances by the likes of Louis Armstrong, Lionel Hampton and Mel Powell with Benny Goodman in a supporting role. I'll take Sonja Henie in the ice-skating silliness It's A Pleasure! ($14.98; MGM). At least that movie knows it's absurd."
1,Forget This One,"The same actors as were in ""THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY"" which was quite funny. A SONG IS BORN is slow, boring and not up to Danny Kay's standards. Mine went into the garbage."
2,Historical Value Outweighs Listening Value,"Perhaps this would be easier to listen to if subsequent casts and the film version hadn't improved on it so significantly, but the 1973 London Cast recording is one of the worst renditions of the Rocky Horror material I've ever heard. Theres just no SPARK to it all! The performances jump back and forth between overdone (belting out lines way too hard and long), to ultra-flat and lifeless. Theres no in-between. Even Tim Curry's musical numbers lack punch, especially up against his magnificant later versions when the show hit American stage and finally, celluloid. In the end, this CD will be of interest to obsessed Rocky fans, but should be one of the last entries into any collection."
2,Get one of the others,"I got a copy of this recently, and while it's interesting to hear the original version of Rocky Horror, this CD is just really poor quality. The thing you have to remember about this recording is that it's a low quality recording of an amatuer show. The sound is terrible. It echos constantly, the cast is less than impressive (even the amazing actors from the later movie are bad on this CD), Some of the songs are either missing or different, and it's really just not worth bothering with with so many other great RHS CDs on the market. If you're a completest or just curious about it, you might want to pick up a copy, but if you're only going to own one copy, I recommend the movie soundtrack"
1,HORRIBLE!!,This is horrible! Based on this recording of the original cast I can't believe it lasted long enough to make it to the U.S. where we made it a hit.The vocalists aren't singers and have a serious pitch problem. The Roxy cast with it's 1st. rate singers make you appreciate the rockin' melodies in ROCKY but here the melodies aren't pronounced.Richard O'Brian the author of the work doesn't even do justice to his own songs! The Riff-Raff in the Roxy version really lets it rip and should've done the movie version also. Pass on this one and get the Roxy cast of L.A. or even the new Broadway Revival version.
5,Great cd! A must have for Rocky Lovers,"This CD is great. The music is better than in the movie, and I like it better than the Roxy cast. It's interesting and fun to hear Tim Curry, Ritz O'Brien, Patricia Quinn and Little Nell do the same parts they did in the movie. It has speaches from the Crim, too."
5,chelsea girl,"This is the only authentic theatrical rendition of RHS as it was originally intended. There is none of the 'belting it out' of the Roxy version, and later versions lack subtlety and drama."
3,It's ok!,"I'm a fan of The Rocky Horror Picture Show and thusly I have several cds full of Rocky music. This is probably my least favorite one in my collection. That being said, it really isn't bad at all.First off, the cast is great. Our Frank, Riff, Columbia, and Magenta are the same cats from the film and they all do a fantastic job. Nell could squeal a bit more and Riff could scream a bit more, but overall if you like them in the film, you'll like them on this. The guy who plays Eddie/Dr. Scott has a great punk snarl. Brad and Janet's voices don't really impress me very much.Musically, the show is pretty sparse when compared to other versions. It is certainly not orchestral like the movie, and the Roxy version really gets amped up. This version just sounds a bit tame.Overall, I'd say if you're a fan of the music already, this album is worth owning. Especially if you're into Tim Curry's growling."
4,"Great jazz, Bad sound","This is really good jazz, with Bird blowin' fine, but the sound is not that great."
3,Figure handicapping ...,"This book is complicated to me. I like to read about handicapping alright, but this book is over my head."
2,Defective Filter,"Technically I can't judge this shower piece because I never got the chance to use it.Upon opening the box and unscrewing the shower head to see where/how the filter goes in, the top of the filter came right off and the contents inside the filter came pouring out onto my carpet. So the filter was obviously defective. Aside from the filter, this product may indeed be good as other reviewers suggest. The company might just need to devote more attention to the quality control of their filters."
1,Not really chrome,"I bought 2 of these last November (this is February) and both were installed and put into use. We were happy with them until last night when my flatmate, during her shower (when the device was in its holder on the wall) fell and hit her on the head. The chrome holder had broken, and examination of the broken piece showed that it was made of plastic! As I say, but for the lump on my friend's head, it was fine.... (these were bought from Amazon, where I buy practically everything else, but this breakage appeared to be a manufacturing defect.)"
1,Disappointed,"Am I the only one to receive a defective shower head? The clasp to hold head does not fit and the shower head is always very loosely suspended. Because of that it can fall easily. Last night it fell and broke. The shower head is now irreparable. I am disappointed that the item that I received does not appear to be the same quality as what others have received and reviewed. Based on this experience, I would not recommend this product to anyone."
3,I like the handle part but .................,"I bought this in nov 2011. I really couldnt tell if the filter worked or not. I didnt notice a difference in skin or hair. The part which holds the heavy head and hose broke, as I was trying to hook it up,(it was flimsy plastic) I have sent out a email to the manufacture."
4,Entertaining,"Loved this book, a romantic drama with just the right amount of suffering as to not make the female lead into a bundle of complete misery."
3,Good to keep on the shelf.,"Every time I hear of one of the plays of Shakespeare, I will look it up in this book. I like to be able to read about the characters as well as of the places they go to. I find it interesting to know if there is a story behind the play."
5,A great read!,"Hop on board for a joyfilled ride! This book brims with sister chicks' personal experiences -- stories that show the ups and downs and detours of real-life, and the ultimate secret to peace and joy in the midst of them.An easy, practical read. Its short stories are perfect for busy women. Surprise tidbits stuffed between chapters offer wisdom and encouragement.A great gift for friends!"
1,DeLonghi coffee makers leaking and not worth for the high price.,"We have received a DeLonghi Coffee and espresso maker as a gift for our new home. Gladly opened the box and put it on our kitchen counter. Just after the first week it started leaking from the side. Week after in addition leaked from the bottom. Today that I write this review, the leak was about of a cup all over the counter. The steam of it seems to start damaging the cabinets and leak is a pain....As I have experienced (40+ years) the $20 coffee makers of other brands, are much superior in every aspects than the $250 DeLonghi. The quality of the equipment, no leak, good customer service, working much longer time without problem and taking much smaller space of your kitchen counter, no difference in the quality of the coffee they make,..... Finally the price is just a fraction of DeLonghi with its cheap, unpractical so said coffee machine."
1,Should have read these reviews,"Short and sweet because it will sum up what others have dealt with. Had it for 1 year and 2 months. Leaked randomly - thought it was me with the coffee pot. Now it leaks more consistently...yeah, for how much you pay for it, one expects to get some more use out of it. Should have read all those reviews before putting it on my bridal registry. Also, mom knew best when she told me never to get a dual-combo thing, something is always less inferior."
1,Disappointing,"I bought the DeLonghi Coffee/Espresso Machine although I was a little weary of the comments I had read in the customer review section. Sure enough, when I used the machine to make coffee, the first thing I noticed was that the heat plate did not keep the carafe warm. After three days the coffee side stopped working altogether. I never even got to use the espresso maker. Luckily Amazon took it back and I will be looking to buy a different brand next time..."
3,BCO130T,"Great Coffe maker! Looks good on the counter, right up to the part where the water comenced leaking from the bottom. Uncontolable water. I called the company, they referred me to a company in Pensylvania. It would have cost me more to send the machine and fix than replace. I called back to the company. I was instructed to cut the cord send to the company. They sent me a new one. But with out the foamy milk maker. Down grade.Less than three months later. This one leaks as well. Good luck people."
2,75% does not equal 100%,"Although the product says it will make coffee, cappuccino,lattes, and espresso, it does NOT make lattes. There are no instructions on how to make them, no place to make the steamed milk, and customer service won't say what to do. As it was purchased mainly for espressos and lattes, it was returned. (The return service was 100%!)"
3,Hot Chocolate?,"The owner's manual did not have recipes for either hot chocolate or lattes. We called their customer service and they were zero help. They even insisted that the recipes were in the manual while they are not. Can anyone help? If you are looking to Delonghi for help, forget it."
1,Good luck with Delonghi's shameful customer service!!,"I bought this coffee maker after owning the Figaro BC0110. After about six months of normal use with the Figaro, the handle to the water tank had snapped in half. The espresso side clogged frequently, and the milk would never quite get hot enough, so I decided to upgrade to this model.I went online to purchase an additional water filter for $5, and discovered that Delonghi charges a ""standard shipping charge of $9.99 per order"" for any of their replacement parts. I was outraged, as this was the only place I could find to purchase this filter, and they were charging 200% of the filter price to ship it to me. When I sent an email to their customer service, they replied by restating their shipping charge. I have rarely had such a horrible experience with a company after the point of sale, and this will definitely keep me from giving this company any more of my business!"
2,Good when it works but not long,It's a good combo when it works but after a 6 months water is leaking from a couple of places.Look for a another brand.
3,Good Coffee - not so good milk steamer,This makes good and FAST regular drip coffee. The espresso maker makes good coffee - but so slow - and the milk steamer is just not user friendly. We have used it a few times - but went back to using our hand-held frother after about 5 trys. We really wanted a good milk steamer - but didn't get it with this one!
4,Misleading MSRP,This is a great product so far... I bought it at a local shop for $115.00 new. Amazon's price is only a handful of dollars beneath the listed MSRP on the Manufacturer's website.
4,Instructions a bit confusing,"I just received this machine today and took about an hour using water to figure out the instructions. Maybe I had a long day and could not understand how to make a cappuccino portion. I looked for that cappuccino button for a long time. It is located on the expresso side together with the strong/light flavor knob. When you start making the expresso, be really quick to turn this knob at the right timing to froth the milk.A bit inconvenient. I also want to try pods because it was messy to clean up. Coffee grinds everywhere ... My first cappuccino was ok, a bit strong but need more milk. I do prefer lattes, and would love to lean how to make them."
1,Stopped making coffee after 2 pots,The first two pots of coffee were delicious and then it just stopped working. We did everything as before and then - nothing. Didn't even bother trying the espresso portion.
2,Second broken DeLonghi,"I received the BCO130T as a gift a year or so ago and because my first DeLonghi espresso maker broke in less than a year, I took very good care of this one. Unfortunately, cleaning it regularly and following the provided instructions did not prevent this one from breaking too! Shortly over a year after having it, the steam part of the espresso maker stopped working. One day, after having few problems with the machine, I turned it on only to have nothing happen. No sound, no coffee, no nothing. I contacted DeLonghi and they said that the warranty had run out and that I should contact a local repair shop to fix it. I would NOT buy another DeLonghi product. If someone pays $100 for an espresso machine, they should get the satisfaction of having a functional product. After having this happen twice and seeing several others with the same problem, I give it a thumbs down and a wave goodbye. My next espresso/cappuccino maker will NOT be DeLonghi."
1,Leaking large amounts of water,I purchased this from Macy's about a year ago and now it leaks water from the bottom when I brew. Customer support is non existent at Delonghi. Please please please keep your receipt if you buy this. You will need it when it breaks.
1,Don't waste your money,Bought this new at a store in my area. The coffee side leaks and the coffee tastes oily. The espresso side broke after making 3 cups.
1,leaks water,"Very shortly after purchase, unit has leaked water every day...every morning I make coffee, move the maker and wipe up the water...based on everyone's review of bad customer service, going back to Cuisinart that I should have just stuck with in the first place!"
1,Don't buy the machine,"I purchased this upgrading my previous version which died. It makes good coffee and good espresso but it cannot froth milk. The milk leaks between the o-ring seals of the red regulator where the milk and steam are mixed. I have replaced every single part of the milk container, regulator, o-rings, tube and nothing worked. I was told to take it to their service center. I took it there and after over a month he requested a new machine. The new machine arrived today and as I tried the frothing, it leaks milk from the top of the red regulator which prevents it from making frothed milk. It seems like the regulator and the seals are not made for this machine. I see an uneven gap when I look at it carefully.I didn't intend to pay $145 for just a coffee machine. I have been using DeLonghi for the past 10 years and I bought this model for the automatic frothing system which doesn't work.DO NOT buy this model."
2,Broke after 6 weeks,"Was a great machine, but broke as noted by other reviewers, simply stopped working one day.I recommend people avoid this product."
2,No problems so far...been 3 months. EDIT: BUSTED at 6 months!,"I've read other reviews complaining about leaking, not working well, etc. But my experience has been GREAT. Makes a great expresso (make sure the grounds are very fine), steams up milk for cappucinos and even for hot chocolate, and makes a great cup of regular coffee. All for less than many other coffee makers. It does take some time to learn how to use the machine properly, but once you get it you can really impress your friends and family as their own personal barrista! Have fun.OK. I'm editing this review. The machine broke, can't get it fixed and now it is useless. Perhaps going with a higher quality machine would be a better idea."
2,ALMOST a great product,"I've had this machine for about 18 months and while looking for a new machine, figured I should review this one.This machine has everything I want, makes great coffee and espresso - but it leaks. I read through reviews here and elsewhere, and it seems to be a design flaw in this and other similar models. I have to wipe up the puddle of water with every pot of drip coffee that I make.Now I'm trying to find a machine that does what this one does, but doesn't leak!"
1,Dissatisfied with inferior product,"We have had several DeLonghi products including earlier generation combination coffee/espresso machines. When our old machine wore out, we tried this new version. We tried the espresso maker and it didn't work right and then the coffee maker and it didn't inject water completely into the coffee grounds. We contacted DeLonghi and they said it was defective and needed to be returned, which we did. Overall it was dissappointing to see a company's product quality degrade so significantly."
1,Worst working latte maker,"The latte foaming piece on this coffee maker has never worked since we purchased it. When we complained and were sent a replacement part it was missing a crucial piece and they still have not replaced it. We purchased this coffee maker for its latte making foam ability. Alas, we have had the machine for almost a month and still cannot make foam."
1,Leaks after 18 months,I loved it when I first got it - now it leaks from the bottom every time we use it.
1,horrible company,I got this as a wedding present. It broke six months later. The company basically told me the warranty didn't cover it. Avoid this company like the plague.
1,Disappointing,I received this as a gift and never used the coffee maker side. I only used the espresso side. The plastic lid to the little pot never fit correctly but I figured I could live with that but in just one year the heating element stopped working. Of course it's out of warranty so now it's just another item to add to the landfills!
1,Broken after 1 day,"The coffee side of this stopped working after one day. The frother only made steamed milk, not froth. Returned it for a refund."
1,LEAKS!,"This is my second BCO-130T Coffee/Espresso machine. The first one worked well for about 8 months then started leaking. They sent me a new one two months after I called customer service. The second unit is now leaking after 11 months of use. Customer Service said that I will need too send to Appliance Parts Mart to get fixed leaving me with out a coffee pot. I responded with ""What am I to make coffe in?"" The CSR Rep said that I should buy a cheap coffee maker to have while mine is in the shop being repaired! Do not waste your money!Spokane, WA"
1,Leaks!,"I have the profuse leaking whenever we use it. Have to use a cookie tray to keep it off the granite countertop. Would NOT recommend. I am going back to a sidearm expresso maker, easier to adjust. Nothing special and nothing you couldn't spend half to do what it does with easier cleaning. You need to disassemble immediately and rinse after frothing milk or it will stay a mess. Sending it to OH for repairs at my cost for shipping but under warranty. We'll see how that goes."
1,What a stupid design!!,"This machine LOOKS nice, but its designers failed to realize that the hot water that flows through the coffee grounds should fall into the MIDDLE of the pile of grounds, not on the edge. I must stop the machine after about 40 seconds to stir the water and grounds to make sure they are all involved in making coffee. Duh! And on top of it all, it stopped working completely after only 4 months' use. And the espresso part, while producing decent results, is a royal pain to clean up. Spend your money elsewhere!!!"
1,it leaks all over the place,"Alas, I've owned my DeLonghi BCO130T for four months and will have to toss it out. It's leaking all over the place. I have no one to blame but myself, because if you read the reviews, you'll find this problem discussed by users over and over again. But I WANTED it to work so badly since the price was so good for all the features it has.But bad worksmanship is bad worskmanship. So to the garbage can it goes ;-( -Now I order a coffee maker, I will pay close attention to the users comments."
2,save your money,"Coffee drinker here! Was thoroughly disappointed with this machine. Makes good coffee but the Expresso is horrible. Stay with the steamer, this auto steamer is terrible!Buy a keurig, and if you need a latte, seek other machine!"
1,Waste of money,I liked this machine at first but after a couple of months it started leaking water on the counter. Then the steamer/frother on the expresso sode stopped working. Thex expresso maker wasn't hot enough either. After less than a year the whole thing completely burned out and left a dime-sized burn mark on my counter. Going back to using the stovetop percolator and the expresso maker. They have never let me down!
1,leaks and then breaks...,"I got this as a gift and have regretted it ever since. The first problem was that it leaks water from somewhere underneath leaving it wet and in need of a wipe down after every use. It also seems to leak after I've cleaned it up. Then today I tried to crank it up and it did absolutely nothing. I tried fiddling with it but to no avail. This is perhaps the worst coffee machine ever. It's overpriced, poorly designed and won't last you very long. I ended up putting my 7yr old Mr. Coffee back in service."
2,"so bad, why",I like cappuccino and didn't to spend a lot to buy an espresso machine. i bought this machine and i enjoyed it only a couple months . No more no less. the regular brewer function really good but the espresso broke after two months and never be able to fix it. customer support=zero.I definitely would not recommend this machine to anyone. that's a waste of money purely and simply.
1,Buyer Beware ! ! ! ! !,"I loved this coffee maker for the first 11 months...then it broke (leaks water EVERYWHERE). Delonghi customer service is awful! This item was a gift, and they are refusing to repair the item and they require me to ship it to them at my cost -- not reimbursed. This is one of the most frustrsting consumer experiences that I have ever dealt with, and the Delonghi reps whom I have spoken with have complete disregard for the situation. It is sad because this has the potential to be a great product, but it is not backed-up by the manufacturer who is making repair or replacement impossible. Buyer beware..."
1,A Leaking Headache,"I bought the predecessor of this model and it seemed to work fine--both for espresso and regular coffee. That is, until a year after I bought it. Then it began to leak every time I made coffee. It would spill about 1-2 cups on the counter through a overflow hole in the bottom of the unit. I couldn't locate the leak and, as it got worse, I decided to replace the unit. I found the new model and assumed the problem was a one-off. I bought this model at a good price and everything was fine until after 6 months, the same problem occurred. I took the unit completely apart and although I found the leak was coming from a built-in overflow tube next to the feeder tube for the coffee maker, there was simply no reason for water to be running out of the tube. In addition, the carafe or lid is a really bad design because if you don't pour slowly, it leaks all over the counter. All told, this is a frustrating piece of junk."
3,Enjoyable fluff,The book makes nice easy reading typical of this sort of romance genre and that's about it. I bought it because I'm hooked on all things Italian and as such it's made a pleasant enough read. There was at least one factual error in it that wine buffs or people who know a lot about Italy would spot which made me lose a bit of faith in the author/novel/editor which was a shame. Having said that it's encouraged me to get off my backside and book my ticket back there!
3,Predictable.....,"Okay, maybe I shouldn't have read this book only a couple of months after reading The Summer in Tuscany. How different could they be after all? Both average looking, widowed (to some degree) women end up in Italy to find themselves, or something from their pasts; they end up finding their dream homes, only to have it be owned by the perfect, rich, powerful, ""Italian God' whom the women immediately take a dislike to, but then fall deeply in love with by the end of the book. As I said before, Ms. Adler gives good descriptions of Italy so that you are able to imagine the beauty she describes, but the stories are almost the same."
2,Nice Descriptions; Boring Book,"This was my first book by Elizabeth Adler. I have a great desire to visit Italy someday, and I thought I would enjoy this book. While her descriptions of Italy - both the scenery and the food - were very good, the story was just plain boring! It was like ""Come on, will you just find out what happened to your father already!"" Why didn't she try to find out more about her husband's antics? Plus no good love scenes at all to keep you occupied! There was a neat twist at the end, but all in all, a boring book. I'm debating whether to try another of her books."
3,Outdated,"While all the reviews are accurate in their interpretation of this book, its author and its format; I however found this book to be outdated. This was a required text for a college course I was taking and that required a major paper to accompany it. I did enjoy the book as an ""outsiders"" view on the culture Americans have acquired, what I did not enjoy was the gap in time from which this book was written to the current date. Culture changes through time and if you read this book you can find plenty of changes in time that make this book not on point in some subject matter. Otherwise, well written and a fascinating read."
2,The USB Port of this MP3 Player is Fragile,"Be careful with the USB port of this MP3 player. I tried to plug it in directly into the computer and must have wiggled it too much while trying to plug it in.It worked fine for a day after I got it, but the next day it was no longer recognised by the computer as a flash drive/MP3 player, and it was no longer possible to put any more files on it.I had to send it back to Amazon.COM for a replacement and will have to be much more careful when handling it next time."
3,wouldn't buy it again,if the battery is brand new it works great. as soon as the battery is half used it starts shutting off frequently.
3,Ok for the money,"I bought this mp3 player for when I go walking so I knew it didnt have much power or space. It can hold about 33 songs. But the first week I got it, it stopped working after only 2 uses. I had to get a replacement. The new one works but the buttons are funny and you can turn it on by mistake if you but it in your pocket. Otherwise its a good buy if you want something cheap."
4,Mac Vision 128 vs 512,"This is a great product for the price and for the younger kids. However, the memory is small for just a little more you can get the 512 which also has the feature of the fm radio."
1,Not worth it,"I've had this for 4 weeks now and haven't yet figured out how to program it. I did manage to download songs but it won't play them became because of a ""file error"". I'm pretty computer literate but this thing has me stumped."
1,Terrible product!,"I couldn't get my computer to even load this properly. It said that Microsoft couldn't verify it was safe, the language was pidgin English, the instructions were obviously from someone who didn't know English well, and although I tried to contact the support Email and telephone message lines, I could never get anything but an automated ""thank you highly and kindly for contacting us..."" Worthless!"
1,problems with song formats,"I have songs from both realplayer as well as Windows media (AAC files and WMA files) This mp3 player would not even recognize the first and though it seemed to recognize the second, still would not play them. As stated in another review, the instructions and support included are in broken English and not any help. Maybe this would be a great player for mp3 format music files, but I do not recommend it for anything else."
5,What are you talking about?,"I bought this item with a gift certificate, and was reluctant to do so because of a couple of bad reviews, but WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT! For the price, this is a great little player, with pretty good headphones!! Since it funcations like a memory key, you DON""T EVEN HAVE TO LOAD THE SOFTWARE!!! just load the music onto it like it was a memory key and your done...It's a simple little tool, holds maybe 40-60 songs, good enough for a run or a work out session, and even has a backlit display...EASY TO USE!! RIGHT PRICE!! as you can tell I am pleased!"
