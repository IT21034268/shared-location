1,Horrible pictures,"Also got this free when I bought a camera. Now I know why it was free, it made the worse color prints I ever saw. Wasted a lot of good photo paper trying to get some pictures."
3,As a printer is an AWESOME SCANNER!,I got this all-in-one for free with my computer back in 07. Printing is average. Cartridges are not easy to find in local stores. Scanning is amazing.
3,RE-RECORDINGS FROM LATE 1980s PLUS NEW SONGS,"Petula re-recorded many of her classic 1960s hits in Europe during the late 1980s for a SECOND TIME (she had re-recorded them less successfully in the mid-1980s in Nashville). But there are some nice, new songs to her repertoire here like ""Send Away The Clowns,"" ""All My life,"" ""If You Ever Go Away"" and several others. Petula sounds great here. But if you just want her original 1960s hits, buy a BMG or Sanctuary CD."
3,1980's Re-recordings of Petula's American Hits,"This CD contains re-recorded versions of some of her American hits plus a few other songs, but the original versions of her 1960's songs are much better. You should purchase one of her greatest hits packages such as Ultimate Petula Clark for her 1960's hits, however, fans of Petula Clark will enjoy several of the tracks on this album. She approaches her old magic in the up-tempo Got It and If You Ever Go Away. We'll Still Be Friends is well done with a beautiful refrain. Turn To Me, All Of My Life, Send Away The Clowns, and Colours Of Love are good tracks."
1,Unhappy,"Looks like a well made valve but it's not. In the off position the valve allows fuel to continue to drip. Additionally, fuel leaks through the seal at the shaft of the knob."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this valve needing it for a spare fuel tank on my motorcycle, it looks to be quality made, but after I got it mounted and the tank filled with fuel it leaked through the seal at the switch shaft, not just a drip but a good flow."
4,cool cd,this cd is pretty cool although if you are buying it just for the song untill it sleeps i suggest that you just buy Load.
5,Jaw-dropping,"I believe the book is now out of print, but if you're lucky you might be able to pick it up at a comic book shop which is where I got mine. This book is FANTASTIC!!! Definitely one of the best fantasy art books out there. Great colors, excellent depictions of Dawn - the fiery redhead with one eye showing *grins* and some of the most imaginative and creative art pieces you'll ever see!Even the backgrounds are incredibly detailed, with everything from dragons to architecture to detailed walls and textures. He really sets the mood in every piece he does.Excellent work of art. Absolutely excellent."
1,Not as advertised...,"According to the information on the website, these socks were listed as being 79% cotton, 20% stretch nylon, and 1 % spandex. When I received them, the label on them says they are 67% cotton, 17% acrylic, 15% nylon, and 1 % spandex...this is not what I wanted. Also, they are very thin and run small. I am disappointed and will not buy socks again online."
1,Very Disappointed,"Gold Toe Women's Classic Crew SockThe socks are thin and instead of elastic to hold them up, have one tight thread around the top. They might do the job if you always wear socks down and need thin. The name ""gold toe"" lead me to believe it would be a quality, thick walking sock."
2,You get what you pay for,"The product did not cost much but also does not give you a straight cut either and in my opinion, is also a danger to use. The blade moves as you use it and will problbly be somewhat easier to handle if mounted to a fixed surface by drilling and mounting it."
3,Good idea but a big problem,"Cutting your own balsa wood strips is very cost efficient and this idea will save scratch builders a lot of money over time. There is a problem with it though. A lot of balsa wood comes slightly warped on the width. Although the ends will be equal width, if you put the sheet up against a straight edge it will be noticeable. Around the center you will notice it is about 1/16th to 3/32nd off. This tool cuts on that uneven line which will give you uneven strips. For thin strips, you can easily bend the warp out but anything greater than 1/8th inch becomes very troublesome.I would personally recommend buying some 1/16th by 36"" by 1"" aluminum L bracket from a hardware store and using a combination of that and a metal ruler to cut your strips."
4,A must-have for Melanesiaphiles,"Anyone who has spent time in the Solomons or Papua New Guinea will recognize the familiar cadence and clarity of these voices. I felt immediately transported to a mission church in a remote village. I especially appreciated 'Early Morning at Tabalia' and the unmistakeable sound of an empty gas cyclinder being wrapped with an iron rod to mark the beginning of the school day. My only gripe is not with the music but the dearth of contextual information in the music jacket. Former volunteers, missionaries, and other visitors to this enchanting corner of the world will thoroughly enjoy this recording ."
4,Walter White,"This book is the end result of many years of investigation by a young Walter White. It tells the almost unbelieveable story of the lynchings and murder of Afro Americans in the early part of the 20th century. Walter White was an Afro American who had blue eyes, blond hair, and white skin. He used this as a way to ""pass"" as white in the 1920's to investigate lynchings for the NAACP. He was later general secretary of that organization from the 1930's till the mid 1950's."
4,Handy snacking,"I like the serving size of 1.5 ounces in these packs - sometimes 1 ounce just isn't enough. They have a nice flavor, rather like dry roasted peanuts, since they have some spice added (paprika, onion and garlic powder, et al) I think the sugar content is a little high. I'd have given them 5 stars otherwise. Nice change from oil roasted almonds, which can seem too oily to me sometimes, or raw almonds."
3,Too Salty!,"Too salty for me. I taste the salt, not the almonds.My personal preference is Blue Diamond Almonds, whole natural, so I can taste the almonds, not the salt."
2,Disappointing product,"While conveniently packaged, these lacked the dry roasted crunch and flavor of some of Emerald's other products -- we are particular fans of the deluxe mixed nuts and the almonds. Would not buy the almonds again."
3,LOVE THIS SHOW!!!,"I remember watching all the Celebrity Paranormal Project Episodes when it aired back on MTV. It's unfortunate that they no longer offer re-runs of this show every Halloween. Can't believe I stumble upon it on Amazon and I had to buy the entire program. The reason I am giving it '3 stars' is because I can't seem to transfer the files onto my Itunes. Sometimes the Amazon Video Library crashes. No good when you are truly enjoying watching this with your Ipad. Come on Amazon, Please FIX YOUR AMAZON VIDEO LIBRARY. :("
3,Something you have to see for yourself,"I liked this show for the same reasons that i liked MTV's Fear, which is mainly because you get to watch people getting scared. And the stories, even though they may be fictionalized in some way, were really good at creating a creepy atmosphere. I liked it but I'm not sure everyone who enjoys watching paranormal shows would care for it."
5,Amazingly simple!,"This is a wonderful book! I have been sewing costumes for years and when I read this book, the author made ""designing"" your own patterns so simple. I was able to design completely from a photo in this book, a doublet for my 1 1/2 year old son for the renaissance faire! Wonderful book! You will reference it on many, many occassions!"
4,OK,"I don't get all of the negative reviews of this film. Yes, it is a Halloween movie, but it's also Rob Zombie!I personally think its his best film so far. I expect ridiculous dialouge and gore. That's what he is all about. But, the thing is, I actually found this movie to be scary. I'm what I'd call a new horror ""veteran"". I've seen the classics. This isn't Michael Bay. This is Rob Zombie. What Michael Bay has done with his remakes is insulting. This is a sequel to a true imagining, and though it is brutal, it is truly origial as opposed to the generic and disrepectful tripe we've been fed so far."
5,Awesome!,"I didn't much like the first one, but the second was good, it wasn't anything like the original, it was way different. Can't wait to see the next one if there is going to be? Who know. But I liked it very much.."
1,Worst of the worst,Dreadful sequel. I can't think of one character that I cared or liked in this movie. The script and story were horrendous.The kills weren't even fun. I like a good sholocky horror movies as much as the next guy but this is just pure trash.A Big D for Dud.
1,What a pile of garbage,"First off,there was no need for Halloween or the sequels to ever be remade.Its not like the 1930's King Kong,where the original was out of date.Halloween will never be dated because its just a man in a mask.Ill admit, the first remake (which was unnecessary) was an ok movie.It told a bit of the back story and although not needed,was still ok to watch.However this sequel is horrible.The story is awful and the girl Rob hired to play Lory is terrible.I kept wishing she would get killed,but she never did....With that said,I hope Rob is NEVER allowed to remake another Halloween or any other movie for that matter,ever again!"
1,Should be zero stars!,"Where to begin.... how about poorly filmed, no suspense, characters you can't care about -nothing but people being hacked to death, a spectral presence with a spectral horse and the f word ad infinitum. A couple of the actors try to make something of what they are given but the task is too great. For some incomprehensible reason the Moody Blues singing ""Nights In White Satin"" is playing on televisions in the background while the first two or three murders are being committed. Why couldn't this guy have put some of his unremarkable music on the tv? Don't encourage this guy by wasting your precious time or money on this one. Five stars for the Moody Blues, zero stars for the movie!"
1,Shouldn't have happened!,"This remake should never have been made. Almost all the characters are unlikeable and Michael Myers (as in the Halloween remake) isn't scary, which makes the movie not scary."
2,The worst remake i think i have ever seen,This was a rob zombie attempt at mixing the worlds of nightmare on elm street with halloween series.....they spent around a quarter to half the movie going back and forth do Ridiculously long dreams that he was making his little sister go insane.....some of the acting was bad even for a horror movie.....this is a true bad rob zombie B-rated movie that is not worth your time unless your a true avid rob zombie fan boy.
5,Unflinching Middle Finger Masterpiece!!!,"This movie should be applauded for it's originality and brutal, unflinching look at how sometimes, no matter how much you love something or someone and no matter how far or how bad things get to break up that connection: Family, friend or foe, we all end up next to each other in the end!!! Family Is Forever!! This is a personal favorite Rob Zombie film!!! This is by far the most heavy, emotional and original ""sequel"" ever made for a horror movie!!! The brutal and NON-Formula (for Halloween sequels in general) violence in this movie is only matched by the inner turmoil we all can have inside of us. Truth be known, I am going through an ugly and depressing loss of ""family"" divorce and some of the dialogue scenes in this film are very carthartic and extremely emotional and I can't think of any horror movie that has hit ""home"" as much as this film has for me!!!!!!"
5,Best Halloween So Far!!!,I think it is Wrong that this Movie has so much Bad negtivite. I think Rob has Done a very Great Job On this Film so please don't let theses other reviews put you of the Film because your making a mistake if you do! I suggest if your A halloween Fan then you Buy the film.
1,WORST HORROR TO REACH THE BIG SCREEN,"I GUESS I CANT LEAVE ZERO STARS SO I HAVE TO GO WITH ONE.POSSIBLY THE WORST HORROR FILM TO REACH THE BIG SCREEN.DID SOMEONE SAY HEY WE NEED A SCRIPT HERE, DONT THINK SO. I WOULDNT EVEN RENT IT. SOMEONE ELSE SHOULD TAKE OVER BEFORE THE MYERS NAME IS RUINED, OR POSSIBLY ITS TOO LATE . SAD WAY TO GO OUT ON MIKE"
1,Rob zombie killed michael myers,I slit my wrist its horriable afther doing a great job remaking the frist one i dont understand
5,Trick or Treat,Great film. just adding more words to this list because they want me to keep talking and I dont. asda
1,LAME AS HELL,"This movie is just another pitiful excuse for Bob Cummings (no wonder he changed his name, what a dork) to single-handedly destroy the Halloween franchise. At least the Halloween sequels prior to Mr. Cummings directorial disasters had a fun factor to them. Not this skid mark of film. It's just more of the same ""in-your-face-Texas Chainsaw-Massacre"" techniques that old Bob The Poser seems to have ripped off yet again. This time, however, we have dream sequences with white horses, how lame can you get?"
1,"Mega Holloween Fan, but this one was awful!!","I am a huge fan of the Halloween series, however this one was just horrible!! Do not get me wrong the more blood and violence, the better, but did the actors really have to use the ""F"" word every thirty seconds? The other major deal to me is Michael Myers (Tyler Mane)grunted every time he killed another victim. C'mon every true Halloween movie fan knows that Michael never spoke in the originals. Just one last note, if you saw the previews on tv and some of the different ones they were showing on different internet sites, you pretty much saw the movie. To me this one stinks just as bad as part three did."
2,not a good movie,The movie was suppose to be agreat movie for me the second encounter to Michael but unfortunate it wasn't it was not a good copy so I'm having to send it back to the person I got it from. It showed too dark and you couldn't understand half of what was going on. So I'm going to have to get a better copy of the movie and hopefully it want show dark.
4,Halloween II Fan Review Feedback,"Though I have yet seen Halloween II, but as an owner of Rob Zombie's Halloween (Standard DVD) it amazes me ALL the negative comments an amateur of motion pictures one has to say. Have you even taken, in your life, a film course? Or actually just sat back and watched the film for more than just entertainment purposes? Hell, film critics who make money watching a film even watch the movie NOT for entertainment. And half of them don't even comprehend what they are watching! So, next time you're watching a movie, whether or not it is in the privacy of your own home or in a crowded theatre, even if it includes the horror genre, look beyond the film. The French were the FIRST to consider film a form of art! Try to understand what the director is saying in his film. Every motion picture has some message. And now, my friends, and now even some of my enemies, that is the FIRST RULE that they WILL teach you in any FILM SCHOOL!"
5,Do NOT buy the directors cut!!!!!!!!! Buy the dvd not the bluray,"I'm a huge fan of rob zombie movies and of the Halloween films. I saw this movie in theaters and I loved it, I thought it was genius, and then I bought the bluray and I wanted to break it into pieces. I don't know what rob zombie was thinking during the cut of this film, and he really ruined the ending on bluray. I gave this a five star review not for the bluray but for the film, please don't listen to the bad reviews of this film, just listen to the bad review of the director's cut. The theatrical version is so great and original so please check out the dvd."
3,Lost direction.....,"This movie opened up excellent in classic H2 style, then as the annoying girl playing Lori wakes up and the film starts going to crap. There are cool parts in this film, good gore, the killings are very realistic but the plot is garbage and the ending is the worst I have seen in a long time. I hope these remakes end now unless they can do better and they pick up making a sequal to resurrection which was also better than the Zombie directed Halloween films. Again decent parts in both remake's but they are the weakest in the entire Halloween series."
2,A bit of a mess,"Zombies films can tend to become bizzare very quickly and this movie it does so the quickest I have seen. Margo Kidder's mask like face is more hideous than Michaels, which is a shame because she cannot take it off. I guess ole Rob see's all of America as a cess pool of trashy people, barely worthy of being considered human. The original Halloween 2 has people you might care about, might want to not see killed, but this version portrays everyone as such pathetic scum that death is a release from their tortured exsistence. Death only counts if you care if the people die; here the deaths are meaningless due to the sub-human portrayal of the chars. There storyline for the entire movie must have consisted of about three sentences because there IS no story."
4,Incredible film... miles better then most Halloween sequels.,"This film blew me away. Amazing story, gritty and real terror. Very involving plot. Seems to be a character piece that goes into depth about what happens if you survive the attack of a serial killer (in this case the survivors of Zombie's Halloween 1) A very twisted and dark, but also well written and character driven tale.I will say though is you are a fan of the Halloween sequels... you don't want to see this. It has nothing to do with those paint by numbers films. (and thank god) This is something very different, and a level above your usually horror stuff."
2,We expected more from ya Rob,I just want to start by saying I like Rob Zombie. His music is good and normally his movies are too. Halloween 1 by Rob Zombie was an astoundingly fresh take on the decades old Haddonfield horror story. It was dark and reminiscent of the 70's. Rob is obviously sentimental about this period like me. You had to be there for you young uns. However H2 severely let me down because the lives of everybody in this movie were so disgustingly trashy that you were hoping for them to get killed and by the end of the movie you feel like you've been dragged through the gutter. It is very depressing and just makes you want to throw it off like a coat that's too heavy. We forgive you though Rob because we know you're capable of much better. Try again and maybe we'll give you another chance.
2,Oh NO,"I love the original Halloween and Halloween II, I also thought the remake of Halloween was OK. This movie was pretty pathetic. I just wish Rob Zombie would have stuck to the hospital environment in the original part 2. In this movie the character of Laurie is changed, she's foul and hard. There are flashbacks with the usage of another child actor to portray Michael and the kids does a terrible job. Overall this movie was a mess. I was so eager to see it and so let down once I did."
2,MICHAEL MYERS R.I.P. PLEASE,"i think it's really time to bury the Halloween franchise. While Rob Zombie's first rehash was reasonably well done, this one's just a bloody mess. Starting with a script that is 95% profanity and a perverted mysticism involving Mikey's mama and a white horse, the movie just drags on with brutal killings, wasting its formidable cast's talents. John Carpenter's original is still the best and I see no reason to continue this series."
2,shouldn't be called halloween 2 / big disapointment,"understand that this is completely rob zombies take on the Halloween franchise. after being disgusted with the first, i gave it another shot hoping at least something was learned from the first mess. why is this even called Halloween 2? there is almost no similarity between the original and this. This movie is not even scary! sick, very graphic, lots and lots of gore, but nothing that scares you like the original. even platinum dunes makes better remakes/ rein-visions of classic horror movies!!!...now thats scary!"
1,There's a reason the next Halloween was going to be 3D.,"If you want to make a music video, make a music video and NOT a movie."
2,just ok,Really more brutal than creative. Horrible acting by most of the cast. Even the usually dependable Malcom McDowell seems to be overacting.
1,Rob Zombie sucks.,"I'm a pretty big fan of the original Halloween series. At first I thought a remake would be interesting with Rob Zombie as the director, but he totally blew it on both movies, especially this one. It's just like any other Rob Zombie movie except it is set to Halloween. It's just a bunch of brutality mixed with bad acting, trailer-trash stereotypes, and hallucinations on the part of the protagonist and the antagonist. The camera shots are dull and boring (and shaky - I think that particular 'horror effect' is ridiculous and actually makes movies look worse), a far cry from the original series, which always established truly creative and horrific shots when the Shape appeared. This movie is really not even worth watching....even if you are a devoted Halloween fan."
1,absolutely unexceptable,"This movie was not only the worst Halloween movie but one terrible movie. Rob Zombie should never touch any established franchises ever again, this is not Michael Myers not at all none of the famous score is in it theere some much wrong with this crap he doesn't even where a mask for most of this movie. Terrible oh yeah and he has a voice WTF? even though the original franchise wasn't getting any better at least it was Halloween its a shame Moustapha Akkad passed away the holder for this franchise and now apparently any one can touch it now. Rob Zombies not directing part 3 thank god lets just hope its not a season of the witch remake and hes back for 4."
3,NOT BAD MR ZOMBIE,"overall not a bad movie - zombie still knows how to make a scary movie and generally it flowed well from the first movie. unfortunately the first was just too damn good, and hence the sequel lacked a bit of storyline and mostly suffered from zombie including his wife as a key character. dont get me wrong, she played the part well, but the whole thing just felt out of place.loved the ending though - think taylor scout did a great job!overall mr zombie, keep making movies as i would still (and did) buy this one!"
2,"The suspense is DEAD here, not a true Halloween Myer Film","I don't know where to begin... this movie was nothing like a Halloween movie nor did it feel like a Michael Myer film. The film is so lacking and not creative as in any Halloween theme. I seriously think Rob Zombie was a wrong candidate to remake HALLOWEEN and ruined any good chances of saving room for any sequels to follow. He also ruined the whole Michael Myers character too, very misleading and using his wife Sherrie Zombie just makes it all the more worst... Rob should have never been given the opportunity to remake HALLOWEEN because he RUINED IT... I hated the whole hillbilly and atmosphere look of this movie... so poorly done and so hard to follow through... this one should be scrapped and remade again by someone with better talent in scriptwriting... MAN I am so bummed out by this film and absolutely hate it..."
2,boring and pointless,"to say i was disappointed in Rob Zombie's followup to his 2007 Remake of Halloween would be an understatement.this thing is no nowhere near as good as that film was.for one thing,its about as exciting as watching paint drying or grass growing.it also goes straight into bizzaro land on more than one occasion,which doesn't really belong in the movie.it doesn't really fit,in my opinion.Zombie really had something going with his first attempt at breathing some much needed life into the franchise and putting his own spin on things.maybe he should have have just left it at that.all i know is he took several steps back with this misfire.for me,Halloween II (2009)is a 2/5"
3,What A Let-Down,"The first Halloween was fantastic... and the music/sound effects.... truly brilliant. This one was such a disapppointment... nothing close to the first.... at all. A total waste. I gave it 3 stars because I like Rob Zombie flicks... but in truth... this sucked. I used digital download rental... I'm out of luck getting a refund, so for now this is the next best thing......Stick with the first, it's a timeless work of brilliance... and forget this one ever came out.Hope RZ comes ot with something soon in the same caliber as Halloween 1... as nothing else he's done comes close."
4,"""Pretty Good Horror Sequel!""","Malcolm McDowell stars in Rob Zombie's 2009 horror sequel.Killer, Michael Myers searches for his sister, Laurie Strode.This sequel's pretty good, but the first one's better. Thisdvd not only has nice picture and sound, but it's unratedwith some neat extras. I still recommend this."
1,Too brutal,"I had to turn it off 17 minutes in. It's just too brutal to watch. After the black woman in the hospital was stabbed repeatedly & Michael Myers left the knife buried in her head, I realized watching that scene actually depressed me. I think most people who feel human feelings would feel depressed after watching that. I've seen hundreds of horror movies, this is one of the only ones I had to turn off. I don't mean that as a compliment. I had to turn it off because I felt like less of a human being watching it. No movie is worth that."
1,"...Rob, Your So Over..!","....Rob May Be A Musician, But He Ain't Got The Chops As Director..This 2Hr. Claptrap, Shot In 16Mm. ""When Will It End"".. Endurance Test, Will End For You 20 Minutes In, As You Throw The Remote, Scream, Bang Your Head & Immitate The Renting Bad Games Commercial..Arrrrrggggg......."
1,don't waste your time,this movie completely sucks. don't waste your time with this movie because basically there is no plot the characters are poorly written and the acting is extremely bad. i had expected better from rob zombie. the only good thing about this movie is the gore but even that way to over done. this is one movie i got up and walked out of halfway threw it. so please don't waste your time.
1,Pure failure!!!!!!,"Rob Zombie should have never tried to remake a classic film with such classic characters and actors...even with that said he worries to much about the slasher aspect of things versus the storyline which is why the remakes of this film and the first one so horrible. Rob Zombie needs to stick with coming up with his own ideas adn stay away from classic films espeically. This film is a waste of anyhones time and money. If you want to watch a good movie watch the originals, even though they are older they are still far better than this crap being shoved off on to the new generation as horror remake."
2,Could have and should have been better,"After watching the remake, I was looking forward to the sequel. It has elements from the original sequel, but goes off in various directions. I was not thrilled with the casting of young Michael in the first film and even less with the updated version. The depth taken to reveal more of young Michael was unnecessary and distracting. As were the spirit sequences with Michael's mother; which to me seemed forced to give Mrs. Zombie more screen time. In addition, the older Michael just didn't seem like Michael. It's definitely more gory and dirty than the first; overall long and disappointing."
1,Super annoying!!!,"This movie doesn't deserve more than 2 or 3 sentences. So, here it goes. Rob Zombie's Halloween II has stupid characters (whom you wouldn't mind if they all died with the exception of Sheriff Brackett and Lori's poor friend Mya). The dialogue is redundant and unintelligible. You're left with wanting more plot. A waste of time. I was expecting more from Rob Zombie than something as dumb and blunt as this movie. That's it. That's the review."
1,Rob Zombie should stick to music videos.,"The title of my review says it all. Zombie is a music video director, and his jumbled, and downright unlikeable movies, with their overkill cursing and almost comical vulgarity for vulgarity's sake, fall flat on their faces time and time again. I love horror movies, Rob and I probably love many of the same movies. But, the injustice that he has done to a classic, TWICE, is no homage. He needs to learn from the past instead of trying to mash up genres and loosely hold them together with trash film-making. How these movies end up in theaters round the country is beyond me...Wait, no, it's solely on the name Rob Zombie that he is given so much freedom. Avoid at all costs."
1,one sad ass sequel,The worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life. Laurie and Dr. Loomis have now become mean. The personalities are completely different from the original. I was wishing Michael would kill them so this nightmare of a movie would end. Recommend this one to all your enemies
3,"Decent, but Disappointing","If you saw the original remake (if that makes any sense), then you probably had some sort of expectation of the second remake, as the first one was actually a pretty good movie. Sadly, the same cannot be said for this sequel. Rob Zombie tries too hard to go out with a bang, and in doing so, skips a good storyline and real scares in exchange for an attempt at shock value and gore. This movie could be classified under the 'torture porn' category (this is not a good thing). Rent it if you must, but don't spend the money buying it. I'll sum it up for you: Michael Myers kills everyone (some while not fully clothed), and the 'surprise' ending isn't really a surprise (as it's alluded to for most of the movie)."
2,If your after a quality blu ray feature look elsewhere,"Well, first i'll start off about the quality of the disc. The picture was horribly washed and grainy as if it was a VHS tape, as far as the sound i was quite impressed, a DTS HD MA audio track was a decent touch but that's about the only good thing i can say about this mess. As far as the film goes, if you want to see michael myers eat dog organs or see him being driven to kill by visions his mother and a white horse, you might like this movie, otherwise steer clear, my advice if you really wanna see it rent it or download it but don't waste your money on this junk, highly unrecommended"
1,UGH!!!!,Now I loved the first Halloween Rob Zombie had done. I do have to say the 2nd was HORRIBLE. Unless you are a diehard fan and have to buy this because it was a seqel I wouldn't recommend it.
1,Seriously Rob Zombie?? SERIOUSLY????,"I've been watching horror movies for a long time, and for a time I was actually a Rob Zombie fan! But this whole venture into Halloween put a swift, resounding end to all that! This was by far the worst horror movie I've ever seen in my life!!! Terrible! Awful!! Utter garbage!! I mean, there aren't enough adjectives to describe how much I HATED this movie! Rob Zombie should be absoutely ashamed of himself for making this drivel!!! Don't waste your time even THINKING about seeing this movie! Please!!!"
2,Not as good as the ORIGINAL Halloween 2,"This movie was ok, but after watching the first Halloween movie by Rob Zombie this movie was really not very good.It was really dark and ""gothy"", maybe he was going for that image, but the story wasn't there. The first movie was WAY better, the ORIGINAL Halloween 2 with Donald Pleasance was really great. This movie compared to that, makes this movie look.........well....not well written or directed. i love Malcolm McDowell, but his role in this movie was not good. Really dissapointing. Don't waste your money on this one, buy the original with Jamie lee Curtis you will like it much more than this one. It had potential.....but what a waste of time......"
3,made no sense should have left it to john carpenter,they could have involved doctor loomis more in the movie and all the flash backs thru me off also michael should never take off his mask he doesnt look scary also bad story altogether sad way to end such a good franchise
3,Halloween II,"Not as good as the first one, thats for sure. It was too dark sometimes and I couldn't tell what I was seeing. The repeated stabbings got boring and it was hard to follow here and there. The first Halloween I could watch every day, but this one I can wait to watch again, though I still liked some parts of the movie."
3,Angel Myers screams the entire movie!,This is an o.k. movie. It's just not in the same ballpark as Rob Zombie's first Halloween movie. The thing that hurts the movie the most is Angel Myers NON-STOP SCREAMING!!! Rob Zombie was attempting to get the girl over as insane but the character ending up being very annoying with the repetitive screaming scenes. Her screaming was just way over done. I CAN STILL HEAR HER SCREAMING!!! The effects are great and it's a decent story.Zombie needs to release a 3-Disc Halloween II set with the movie on one disc. The second disc could have anything dubbed over in place of Angel Myers screaming and the 3rd disc could be 4-hours of Rob Zombie explaining how he thought it was a good idea to let that girl scream like she did during the entire movie.
3,i thought it was michael myers,"This movie wasn't bad for what it was, but c'mon. The story from the first one didn't really even follow, the cops killed Michael, not the girl. Why was Loomis such an ass? I get how it ties into the movie, but it is a different character completely, until the end at the shed. Finally, Michael has always had sister problems, his mother never told him when to kill, I think that ol' Rob Zombie got Michael and Jason confused. Should have just changed Haddonfield to a lake and called it Friday the 13th, it would have been better than the last movie in that series."
3,A little underwhelming...,Not as good as the remake of the original that Rob Zombie did. RZ should have stopped after the first one.
2,Was okay,"Having loved the first halloween that Rob Zombie did and loved, I had high expectations for the second, and I was kinda let down. It definitely had it blood scenes, but it was just okay. Maybe I need to see the unrated version next to give it a better rating."
1,"Rob Zombie's ""Halloween II""-Dr. Loomis & Laurie Strode SUCKS In This Movie","Well, as bad as ""Remakes"" & ""New Versions"" of movies go, they just seem to keep being made, case in point, Rob Zombie's ""New Version"" of Halloween II. The plot is soooo far removed from the original {& far superior} Halloween II, that it should of died a quick death right from its conception. True, you shouldn't make a remake EXACTLY like the original, but that doesn't mean you should stray TOO FAR from the original. Actor Malcolm Mc Dowell's awful portrayal of Dr. Loomis is appalling. He makes Actor Donald Pleasance's BRILLIANT portrayal of the good Doctor cringe in embarrassment. Same with Actress Scout Taylor Compton, who portrayed Laurie Strode. Actress Jamie Lee Curtis should be shaking her head at disappointment at her psycho performance. Along with the also GOD AWFUL Jason X, this movie ranks a great horror stinker, that makes the original cry in shame."
2,Such a Dissapointment,"I wanted to like this movie. I really, really tried to like it. And I did love the first 10 minutes or so, but the rest of the movie is just not good. Maybe it isn't all bad, but it sure isn't a Halloween movie. I was so dissapointed in the film. After the awesome 2007 remake I just knew this movie would be great, but Zombie goes in a totally different direction. While I can respect that fact that he wanted to try and do something unique, it just did not work. Sorry. If you are a fan of the series, then I will tell you to check it out simply because it is technically a Halloween movie, but I would not suggest buying it."
4,IT IS WAT IT IS...love it hate it.,"ok so it would get 5 but zombie has to always release directors cuts that change the best parts of his movies to make em more f ed up. remember halloween one? the prison break, instead we get rape. yeah dont expect the original master peace ending! he changes it to an ending thats ok. but it was a good movie. and it was better than what they were planning. a difforent director to do it in 3D? no 3D sucks. any way get it, but if you can find the theatrical version get that one."
1,Bad sign when you begin laughing...,"The moment I saw Rob's Wife and that horse I actually laughed! What a ludicrous way to put his Wife who CANNOT ACT in his film. I watched it with commentary to see what he said about this and he added the horse idea because one day on the way to the shoot he saw a horse?! Anyhow, HORRIBLE as you actually WANT Laurie to get killed! She was as unlikeable as the White trash scattered throughout the film. The language was appalling. This was Haddonfield, not Rob's home which he obviously after viewing his other so called films grew up around. There was NO need for that profanity from the lead character. Dr Loomis is now a jerk obsessed with fame? Danielle Harris was excellent and the ONLY reason to watch this. I was really hoping Michael would kill off Rob's Wife lol! Pathetic."
1,Zero Stars!,"Terrible, absolutely terrible. I didn't have really high expectations for this film when it came out, but regardless i gave it the benefit of a doubt and decided to see it on the big screen anyways. This film should of never have been remade, it is by far the worst halloween film of all time and not only was I personally offended by the film, I was actually angry while leaving the cinema. RZ really killed the halloween series for me, I cannot believe there are people out there who actually enjoyed this piece of garbage. One of the worst films I have ever witnessed. Period."
3,"Nice mask, but.....","In this movie, Michael Myers doesn't quite know how to handle his weapons! Goodness! With the way he's handling them, he'll be cutting himself! The director and producer of this movie make the star Michael Myers look like he needs to go back to school to learn how to use his tools. Enough said.One more thing, WHY are Michael's weapons still so clean after all that dicing of his victims? Director, cut those scenes please! Get the fake blood out of those canisters and drip the tools in them before pausing the dicing scenes!"
3,HE ACTUALLY ATE THE DOG,"OK,THIS IS NOT A REMAKE BUT PART 2 OF THE LAST ONE AND BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL,THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE IS MICHAEL IS JUST PLAIN BRUTAL NOT COOL AND MYSTERYOUS LIKE THE ORIGINAL THE WORST PART WAS WHEN HE SPOKE,IN THIS MOVIE HE'S JUST A FILTHY BUM,I HOPE HE COMES BACK A LITTLE CLEANER AND COOLER,BUT OVERALL A PRETTY GOOD FLICK,JUST KEEP THE MASK ON"
1,SEQUEL SUCKS,tHIS IS ONE OF THE WORST HORROR MOVIE EVER.tHE LEAD CHARACTER SCREAMS THROUGHT THE MOVE AND THE DR'S EGO NEEDED AN OVERHAUL.tHIS MOVIE WAS NOTHING LIKE THE FIRST REMAKE OF HALLOWEEN THAT IS A MODERN MASTERPIECE.i HEARD THAT ROB ZOMBIE WILL LEAVE THE HORROR MOVIE BUSINESS.WELL HE LFET WELL BEFORE HE WAS FINISHED MAKING THIS MESS.WHY BRING BACK MICHAEL'S MOM THIS WAS JUST AS BAD AS THE PISS POOR FRIDAY THE 13TH 3D MESS.STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE IF YOU ENJOYED THE FIRST ONE. THE BLU-RAY HAS ONE OF THE WORST TRANSFERS I HAVE SEEN.
1,Who farted?,I thought the first one was bad but wow this one is way worse! Actually got bored. Wish I could be paid millions to write these Oscar worthy scripts.

5,Works like they say it will,"This is used to maintain water level in a tank on a pressure washing trailer. It works just like they say it will.If I could improve it I would have it shut off a bit more gradually to reduce water hammer, but this is something you can add an accumulator for if your application requires it.Works like they say it will and keeps on working. I bought a second as a spare for my parts bin in case it ever failed while I was on a job, and I think I wasted my money there."
2,Weird sounding remastering...,There are some great songs on this album but I was really disappointed with the remastering. The sound has been puffed up too much. There was a noticeable increase in tape hiss due to the excessive top and bottom end EQ. Too much was done during mastering and we're left with something that doesn't resemble the original sound.Remember when you were a kid and used to press silly putty onto comic strips? The first thing you'd do is stretch the picture so the character's faces were distorted and elongated. That is what this remastering sounds like. The sound is stretched and distorted away from the original mixes. It's like the audio version of watching a 4:3 show on an HDTV... Stretch-O-Vision(tm).Friday Music has been releasing a lot of great stuff. It's unfortunate Joe Reagoso has taken this heavy handed approach to mastering.
5,I've read it again and again,"My mother gave me Nova when I was 15 - I couldn't get beyond the first few pages. It's 20 years later, and I guess I've read it dozens of times, each time experiencing new layers of meaning, watching the layers and richness of the novel unfold as my experiences in life unfold with it.I am not a big SF fan, maybe one book a year. There's something extraordinary - almost Shakespearean - in Delany's ability to capture fundamentals of how we function and think as humans. The story, the worlds, the technology of Nova mean little to me. It's what I learn about myself through the characters that bring me back to this amazing novel time and again.I never know what I will encounter when I reread Nova. And I never know if I will reread it days from now, or years from now. I do know that wherever I am in my life, I will find something new. Thank you Mr. Delany, you have made a difference in my life."
5,Perhaps the most perfect SF novel yet written.,"Painstakingly structured; gorgeously written; constantly referencing myth, archetype and the history of SF itself. Delany set out to create a fully three-dimensional future, and he brings together a mind-bogglingly diverse group of characters from all across a futuristic society. Then he throws them into a compulsively readable adventure story that's also a meditation on the interactions between technology and what's truly human (including art, love, hate and many others). Not nearly as outre or sensational as _Dhalgren_, but this book does everything you could expect a ""pure"" SF novel to do. Don't pass this up"
5,buy it if you can find it,"In my opinion, this is Delany's best work. It incorporates aspects of the archeotypical ""search for the Holy Grail"" with classic space opera adventure. It is intellectual without going over the edge like Dalghren or some of his later novels. The characters are diverse and interesting, and display an array of human failings that make for good interactions. It also explores some territory that is now considered cyber-punk, ie man-machine interfaces and strange designer drugs. All of this and it's out of print."
5,Delany's Peak,"This was the best of Delany's SF books, meaning before the sexual and philosophical excesses took over, ...Delany was at the height of his powers, drunk on language, myth, space opera. This is one of the best SF books ever written--and one of the most fun. We can only wonder what other wonderful gifts Delany might have given us, had he continued in this vein. Instead, he disappointed us all by moving into post-modern, post-sexual, deconstructive claptrap. Such a waste! I can't believe anyone actually ENJOYS ""Triton"" or ""Dhalgren"" YUCK!"
2,Open interpretations of a sci fi adventure.,Each person will have a different reaction to this bizarre novel.Attempt it only if you have mastered other Delany novels.
1,"Disjointed, disappointing, timebound book","There is the kernel of a great idea here: that the discovery of a huge quantity of a new energy source would be a game-changer. That's true whether applied to our current world or to a galaxy-spanning empire. To what lengths would a person go in order to gain access to this energy? What would the powers-that-be do to maintain their monopoly on the current energy source? Start a war? Yes, the plot of Nova has strong echoes that resonate in a line straight from its 1968 creation right down to Iraq today. Unfortunately, the novel suffers from cardboard villains and unlikeable protagonists, not to mention weird digressions on the value of Tarot cards in predicting one's future. I'm afraid Delany toked one too many while writing this disjointed, disappointing, timebound book."
1,Don't bother.,"Despite its limited but high ratings, I found this book awful. I don't know why I finished it. Cliche upon cliche, disjointed plot, more fantasy than science fiction, ridiculous characters, and so forth."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR - BUYCOSTUMES,"BUYCOSTUMES sent the wrong item. Rather than sending out the correct product or a substitution, their response was ""too bad, return it to Amazon."""
1,Don't buy this,We bought this for our grandson who is very careful with toys. We set it up and the leg broke off first thing. We tried to glue it but it never was the same and we ended up throwing it away.
2,OK for telephone,"I like the idea of this switch, and the way that you do not need to fumble with switches to go between headset and handset, or between telephone and computer, but I found this useless for voice-recognition, getting very poor recognition despite trying various different headsets, which led me to believe that the problem was the switch itself. However, it seems fine for telephone use, especially for the price."
1,very dissatisfied,"Immediately the headset did not work. Just a bunch of static, should have listened to the other reviews. Had to purchase another headset."
4,It is fine,Searched the internet for a wireed headset and found this reasonable price item. This unit is capable for both PC and phone headset. When I used for phone just put the phone handle on the unit. The weight on the phone handle will switch the unit from PC headset to phone. It is fine for my office use. The only draw back was the headset is not stereo. So I use a regular PC stereo headset to replace this mono-headset. It work perfectly.
3,A bit weak,Easy to set up and use but people on the other end of the line said I sounded weak and somewhat 'nasal'. You have to speak louder when using this if you have it installed after a fax/phone system. It may be fine with a more direct connection.
1,headset,very simply put . . . the product does not work. I believe all the parts were not sent . . . if they were then it is defective. i would like a refund.
5,I LOVE this group!!!,I absolutely love everything they do! They're the perfect mix of rock and country. They're not too bad to look at either! I think they'll be around for a long long time.
1,"Definitely not ""good"" condition","They claimed this book was used, but in good condition. When it arrived, the first four chapters were no longer attacted and fell right out. I found the return policy to be very confusing and even more frustrating was that after shipping costs, the book cost about $7.00 less than if I would have bought it brand new from the bookstore. Also, I paid for faster shipping and it still took the standard mail time to get to me. This was a very disappointing experience with amazon."
4,Comprehensive Radiographic Pathology,"This book is a valuable educational tool. It has the information to assist the technologist in recognizing what they see, or in planning the exam to find suspected pathology."
5,foxfire,I am glad that I heard about this book. Good information. It is nice3 to see what other people use to do with hardly anything.
4,Foxfire Review,"This was a good buy for a hard-to-find item, and it shipped quickly. The dust jacket was in a little rougher condition than expected, but all in all, it was a fine deal. Would recommend to others. Thank you."
4,Good information for improving farming methods in poor countries,"This author gives valuable information for those wanting to help those in poor countries improve their farming practices. He has a good list of things to do and not to do. Mostly meant for long term work, but found some good tips for short term trips too. He has lots of actual experiences to draw from."
3,Just to Add to the othe Comment...,"Good overview, history, but the book tends to focus on ""why socialism failed"" and tends to repeat the ""anarchists were sold out by X"" theme a lot. More interesting from a post-colonial studies perspective, really. Anarchists would benefit most by its arguments/analysis of the postcolonial socialist governments, rather than find any insight into the shape of the anarchist movement in Africa, which is vaguely depicted, at best."
4,Newton,This is great book for anyone who is interested in going deeper than high school history. It is well written and takes you into the life of one of the greatest minds this world has known. I was surprised by my own ignorance. I thought he was a scientist. There was no such thing at the time. Newton was a philosopher of nature.
5,Have you ever wondered...,"how people became who they are now? This well-crafted book takes one Irish Catholic family and works backward in time to discover the answers to why they are the way they are, how their relationships have formed, the effects our families have on us. Some parts of the book really do stay in your mind like perfect snapshots. I love the end. Highly recommended."
1,Walker cup holder,"I used this for 1 trip. It doesn't hold very many things securely and sticks out so far that people bumped into it!!! A bottle of water falls all over the place. I took it off and bought one that folds up when not in use, and is adjustable for each container.I do not recommend this item!!"
4,Great bargain,"Great shower head, great flow ! Will buy another for other bathroom! Just wish it had the rubber tips in jets, but still flows good after 30 uses."
2,Drizzle,I am dissapointed in shower head. It should be called a drizzle shower head instead. I will be replacing this product for something better!
3,Alexander the Great's Art of Strategy is much better,"I recently read a slew of books about Alexander the Great in anticipation of the movie. I have to admit that hile this academic text might be required reading of many college and high school history classes, I found Alexander the Great's Art of Strategy much more engaging, insightful, and fun to read. The battle descriptions in the this book are phenomenal. One feels like one is right in the middle of a battle. Rufus doesn't do such a great job."
5,ps2 Full Size Glow Controller,"This is a great controller for the ps2. It has a longer cord than the controller that comes with the system. It glows in red, and has the turbo function that is great for some one like me who has arthritis in their hands. It also has a program feature that I can't review because I haven't used it. All in all I say that is a wonderful wired controller."
1,not good,Not working .there was no improvement with the water in the pond. This product is a waste of money.
1,Both bags broke after day 1,"I bought these based on the positive reviews, however my experience with this product is a messy nightmare in the pond. Both bags I used that contained the straw broke after 1 day in the pond. The mess was unbelievable and tedious to clean up. I recommend staying away from this product at all costs if you actually want a CLEAN pond. This was awful!"
5,Was skeptical but proven wrong,"I thought...how can a bundle of straw floating in my pond help make it clear? Well, let me tell you it really works. I can't believe how clear my pond is today, it has never been so clear."
4,very big,these work pretty well but they were about three times the size i thought they were and i have a very small pond so it looks a lil weird but seems to do a pretty good job
5,Barley straw works!!,"I have been using barley straw for 3 years now, ever since I had a bad case of string algae. It truly works, but you have to give it time to establish itself in the pond, and then keep it in always. I place mine in the waterfall weir where the water runs through it always. No more string algae, or any other algae for that matter. And Summit Chemical shipped ultra fast and has the best price that I could find."
1,Pretty Small Bags for Big Ponds,"I have to admit, my pond is pretty big, so I bought a couple of bags. Unfortunately barley straw didn't work at all. My advice to the seller is ""give us some bigger bales""for the price..after all...this is STRAW...its not that expensive to produce."
4,Works,"Have used this for a year now, pond has been clear since about 4 weeks after using it. Have it in the waterfall so water always passes through. When it rains I take it out and let it dry and replace back in the fall so the top always stays dry."
5,Works Very Well,Place this product near the waterfall of my 600 gallon pond about 3 weeks ago. The rocks making up the waterfall were all covered with algae and although the pond had recently been serviced and cleaned the water had already started to get murky. Three weeks after placing one bale in the pond almost 100% of the algae is gone and the the water much clearer. I would highly recommend this product and will continue to use it.
1,I'd go with something else,I can't really stand behind this product. I just have not been able to see the results really and there's no real way of testing(on your own) the effectiveness of this product without using this product alone as a control. I'd recommend Microbe Lift PL(beneficial bacteria) and a few of there barley based products.
3,"Well, the dogs ate it",I was hopeful. I put it in at night after the dogs went to bed. It was gone the next morning. I picked up what pieces I could salvage and threw them in. Wish it would work if you submerged it.
4,Can't beat it for cuteness!,"I bought this for my 6-year-old cousin's birthday. I have to say, I was quite taken with it when I saw it at the store! My cousin seemed very pleased with it, and we put the batteries in it right away, so she could play with it. My husband had to remind me to give it back to her! I didn't get to see her play with it, though, as an actual baby arrived at that moment, distracting her!The noises are super cute and puppy-like, though they seem a bit limited, as does the movement. But I remember being a little girl and being delighted just to have a stuffed Persian cat toy that squeaked when you squeezed it, so I don't think that would limit a child's enjoyment of the toy"
5,my newborn puppy!,this puppy is so sweet..you will feel like you have a newborn puppy in your home!!!
3,not practical,"The watch is cute and the pink leather band is very pretty, although, it is not practical. The first day I wore it I had to retire it, the band got dirty from me just handling it.I haven't worn it again because the band is a little dirty and it doesn't look appealing to wear."
3,Hot & Cold,"The first quarter of the book is excellent, the last quarter pretty good. The other half is where I found myself skimming the pages for relevant and interesting material but didn't find much.Perhaps I expected too much after this good start. Social issues underlying the story are relevant and well presented in my view.Read it, just get over the rather boring part without quitting."
1,It's a Romance not a legal thriller,"Mr. Lescroart/publishers should reclassify his books as romances. I've read 5 of his books so far and only one of them came close to being a ""legal thriller"". The rest are more romance than anything else. This book in particular is the worst in that regard. If you want to read about Abe Glitzky and the lady Senator (an old flame) then get this book. If not, get his 'Nothing but the Truth'. It's far better.My idea of a ""legal thriller"" is along the line of Primal Fear by William Diehl."
5,One of the best comic book mini-series around,I love this graphic novel because it tells how the Punisher character evolved from a beloved family man to a vigilante crime fighter. It is the perfect comic book mini-series that I have read in a long long time because it deals with real life issues of death and coping with loss of family members.
3,i was expecting an origin story,"this was alright. it started off really exciting when the punisher's in prison, but by the fourth issue it kind of fizzles out into mediocrity. this being the first punisher mini-series, i thought it would be the origin story where his family's killed and he takes revenge. this book is not that story, i don't know where that one is..."
3,Almost good,This story would have been sooo good if it weren't for the two last issues. The brain washing is what killed it for me. I have seen to many stories where some group of people are trying to create a race of super soldiers. It took away the reality feel to it that the book has half the time. And the Punisher was too caring. He was skocked when he saw a little girl get shot or couldn't believe that angel betrayed him.I am so glad that Ennis gives a better and more meaner and more colder Punisher.
1,Zaurus Users: Not the Right Card for You as of 3/6/2004,"Zaurus users, there is an ""old"" and a ""new"" version of this card. This is the new version, which is less expensive, but DOES NOT work out of the box with the current Zaurus Spectrum drivers available on myzaurus.com (or on socketcom.com). The old version is the WL6000 (B00005RZP3) which does have Zaurus driver support as of 3/6/2004.Don't buy this cheaper, newer card unless you're convinced the drivers are available at the time you read this."
3,You get what you pay for.,"One can not expect too much for the price. These aren't home theater speakers. They are small computer speakers. The sound is muddy. The woofer looks nice. The satellites look like little creatures from a bad movie. The blue light on the right one is nothing less than eye searing. They don't sound too bad with a bit of tweeking. If you want real good sound,expect to pay at least twice the price. With that all said, not a bad deal."
2,they sounded good but...,"OK...I bought these at best buy and I got home set them up and they sounded great. Then the next morning came and I went to put in my headphones into the jack on the right speaker, but it would go in all the way! Then I noticed that there was no sound coming from the left speaker. Now i don't know if i had that one out of a million speaker set that had defects...all i can say is that im pretty ticked."
2,they're mediocre,"I've had these speakers for quite a while and all I can say is you get what you pay for. The sub on these speakers are to muddy and bassy. Plus a little annoying. The satellites are weak. They only have a mid-range driver so the treble is pretty awful on these. The sound overall sounds greatly distorted when playing music and etc. Honestly I think your better off with speakers from creative or altec. My little brother got some speakers from creative in the same price range and those speakers are much more better balanced compared to the logitechs and on top of that they're 4.1. Another bonus about the creatives my brother bought is that it comes with a nice little control pod that you usually only see in the higher end speakers. All in all the logitechs sound quality is pretty poor compared to other speakers. It would be best to just save up for something better, buy from another company or even better just stick with headphones."
4,Value for money!,"My family purchased a computer mid-2002, and were happy with everything but the sound quality. We went out and bought these Logitech speakers, and were blown away at what we got for the money paid.Music plays with better sound than on our CD player, games are clear and eciting, and the logitech speakers are small and compact. The sub-woofer is great for bass, especially when playing music.Good speakers, great price!"
5,GREAT speakers for the price!,"It took a bit of tweaking to get the bass where I like it, but for the price these speakers can not be beat. My only complaint is the laser like blue LED on the small speaker. It's way to bright. I fixed that with a bit of scotch tape to defuse the light."
1,DISASTER,The person selling the book I needed for teaching my class did not have the $ to send the book.I am waiting to see my Credit Card Statement to see if I got my $ back.This is enough to forget ever using Amazon!!!!
1,This edition's answer key is completely out of print!,"This is the 2001 edition of Repaso, whose answer key is impossible to find anywhere. Avoid this edition!You want to buy the 2004 edition instead:Repaso: A Review Workbook for Grammar, Communication, and Culture (Spanish Edition).And then you want the 2004 edition's answer key with ISBN 0078607086:Repaso A Review Workbook for Grammar, Communication, and Culture ANSWER KEYwhich is easy to find."
1,Wrong edition,Not only did they send me an old edition that I couldn't use but it took over a week to arrive from Maryland when I live in DC
2,Does the job but designed with planned obsolescence,"I have used the 40 watt Pondmaster units for several years. Generally they do an excellent job of clarifying the water. Three units keep my 6000 gallon pond very clear. However, the ballast is subject to damage because the gasket around the quartz sleeve pushes into a pressure switch at the base of the unit. After using the unit for a few years, the gasket becomes distorted, lets water into the electical fixture, allowing the ballast to burn out. A replacement ballast costs over $100 and is difficult to find. I have a collection of four or five burned out ballasts that can't be repaired. Since bulbs last about two seasons, it generally costs about the same amount to buy a new unit as it does to replace all of the parts (ballast, quartz sleeve, and bulb). Hopefully this is not a deliberate strategy by the company to sell replacemente units, but one has to wonder."
1,Pondmaster 02940 UV clarifier,"This UV clarifier is one of the worst products I have encountered avaialable for consumer purchase. The halos will fail after about a year; the unit will disintegrate, resulting in a huge leak and the pond will be pumped dry unless the pump has a float switch. The manufacturer claims the clarifier may be installed outside the pond. WRONG. The environment will eventually degrade the halo connections and they will crack, leak and fail. Please don't purchase this horrible product."
2,Poor quality filter,Bought mine a year ago and the ballast gave out after about 3 months. Pondmaster does not sell any replacement parts except for the bulbs (now have 2 good ones). Pondmaster website contact wouldn't return emails. Ballast is sealed and cannot be removed to be replaced.Warranty was void because I had to add an extension to the cord (this is no way affected the ballast -I extensively bench-tested the unit).Expensive piece of tubing at this point. It did work fairly well while it worked.
1,UV tube lasted 90 days Ballast lasted 140 days,Purchased in May and by August the UV light had burned out. Worked good but didn't last.Added remark:After replacing the light tube the ballast failed at 140 days of use.
5,"IF YOU LIKE MAPS AND COLOR PICTURES, THIS IS YOUR BOOK.","This is a great book for people who like lots of pictures and maps. It not only provides you with tips on travel (phonec calls,money ect) but it gives you insight into the different sections of the Loire. Each major attraction has one or more pages dedicated to it. The book really gives you a feel for what you will be seeing. It is one of the best guide books i have ever bought. I liked it so much i bought the one for Paris."
3,"Great style, but found lacking in substance","This book is almost great. Almost. It tries to give you the best of all worlds-- in depth tours; some local knowledge (restaurants and such); and pictures. As one might expect, the scope becomes to broad to do any of it well. I was disppointed with the tours it gave; it seems like it missed much-- so much so that I bought the Michelin Green guide while there. One of my main gripes is the size of the book-- its too big to fit in any type of pocket. It does however have a slick rain-resistant cover, and the cover folds to become a useful bookmark."
4,An Extraordinary Classic,"This is a Latin American classic read in most literature courses.Best read in Spanish. The detailed use of words helps to better describe and understand the complete picture, the actions are relfected as a small part of what goes on.Im no critic, just an interested reader and wish for all to take an interest in this book"
1,Poor Design,"I like everything about the Craftsman Shoe Storage cabinet except the fact that my size 12-D dress shoes don't fit into the narrow, undersized storage compartments. After two hours assembling I am either going to have to modify the criss cross racks or buy new ones so my shoes will fit the cabinet-not what I had in mind for a $260 investment.Seriously, unless you have a very narrow shoes I wouldn't recommend this product."
4,Agree with the other reviews,"The cabinet is very sturdy and solid. The assembly does require two people. The wood screws seem to be cheap and hard to screw into the wood. We left out some of the inserts in order to make bigger shoe cubbies. This works well in the space and for the number of shoes we have, but will not hold 42 pairs of adult shoes."
3,need a mechanical engineering degree to assemble,Did not state came in all pieces with very poor directions and needs two people for assembly. it took 2 days to put together and then does not hold 42 pairs but logically 42 individual shoes......
3,"Good Graphics, really slow play.","I rented this game when it first came out. It is a decent RPG. The problem that I had with it is that all the arena look exaxtly alike. There is very little variation from town to town within the game. Although the character development is a bit tedious it is very in depth. I love RPG's for the story aspect. This one has a pretty good story. Overall, I would say that it is OK. It certainly is not a Knights of the Old republic or a Final Fantasy."
2,"Decent concept, mediocre execution","I must say, this game is pretty fun. However, there are lots of little things that have decreased the enjoyability of my experience, this game definitely lacks polish.The most critical thing for me here is the lack of stability. During the beginning of the game, it is very stable and fully playable; but the further I progressed, the more and more it crashed on me. It is very frustrating to lose the results of a 20 minute battle (assuming that you save between every battle) simply because the code just isn't robust.There are plenty of other pet peeves that I have with the game, but they are relatively small, and numerous. This game is good, and I probably would've given it 4 stars if the stability wasn't so poor. Keep in mind, this is for the PS2 version, I do not know about XBox or Gamecube versions."
2,i got bored very quickly.,"let me start off saying that this was an impulse buy. on the back, it had a rating of 9/10 from game informer, and it was made by lucasarts, a company i trust, so i thought, ""okay i'll get it."" big mistake. I played it as soon as i got home, expecting a fighting game where you could actually control how the character fights and moves. but instead it's a game where the characters move in an almost chess-like manner. and the dialogue is very very slow. luckily, i also bought LOTR The third age, where you can at least go through the game without menu-surfing 24/7."
3,Disappointed,"This lens had a good write-up but I have been very disappointed with it. It produces blurred pictures, it's movement feels ""gritty"" and negative and it does not focus well. I guess you get what you pay for in the end of the day!"
5,freaking awesome,"ohh my god this is the best movie i have ever seen, it is sorta like the matrix but it beats out the matrix like 80 billion times, literally, it is like 200 stars... out of 5 stars... the best movie i have ever seen, SEE IT!!!!"
3,Under Rated,"For a good sci-fi,action movie you should give Equillibrium a look.Hard to believe this film was not released on the big screen here in NZ.I saw a pirate copy from the internet and immediately took a liking to the story ,characters and action sequences.Christian Bale great as the ""Grammaton Cleric"",a fantastic title for an enforcer of law.I bought the DVD as soon as it was available.Recommend people who liked ""Blade Runner"",""Matrix"",The Fifth element"" and ""1984"" give it go."
5,Most underrated movie of 2002,"Roger Ebert was the only ""mainstream"" critic to appreciate the greatness of Equilbrium. That speaks volumes about the clarity of Ebert, and the obliviousness of mainstream movie criticism.Equilibrium is The Matrix with a brain, and a heart, and better action sequences, and better acting. It is visually riveting from the opening to the closing scene, and it includes at least 2 very surprising plot twists. Anytime I hear anyone bring up Matrix (or Matrix 2), I am going to interrupt them with Equilibrium."
1,Alternative to this version,"There is another Blu-ray available on Amazon that is listed as ""Movie - Equilibrium"" that lists it as having the 2.35:1 aspect ratio. I have not purchased this Blu-ray so I cannot confirm if it holds true or not."
5,Just be glad it isn't Ultraviolet,"What we have here is a difficult to accept premise, some nasty plot holes, aggressive fast cut editing (seriously, I would like to see an action scene go UNCUT for at least 30 seconds), a couple of effects that seem to have suffered heavily from the budget chopping block (namely where John Preston does a back flip off a motorcycle)......and loads and loads of AWESOME. Awesome acting, awesome short drama/character sketches, awesome action... just awesome."
1,Poor excuse for a movie,"This movie was highly recommended. I regret wasting the time watching it. I hoped, vainly, that it would get better but it did not. Matix made you think about our world and our reality. This movie did none of those things.I read a lot of SF and this script is so poorly done that I was getting madder and madder at the stupid dialog and character ""motivations"". I offered to lend the DVD to friends but they would not take it.If you want a well crafted movie rent or buy Donnie Darko."
1,what the?...,"at first i thought this was a satire or a spoof (if it would be it wouldve taken comedy to a whole other level, seriously). but then i started reading reviews and I became aware that this movie is on the level (unless this is the biggest inside joke of all time - andy kaufman, eat your heart out!)...uhhh..welll, that being said, everybody that was involved in this movie, in any way at all, should be ashamed that they call themselves movie lovers at all! I seriously thought that this movie was a SPOOF!! I CANNOT BELIEVE the amount of people that liked this movie!!! If Im missing some profundity in this peice of ""work"", somebody please get the memo to me ASAP, because DAMMMMMM!"
1,"Stupid, self-indulgent sci-fi","I really wanted this to be good - there's nothing I like more than a good Sci Fi movie that challenges the world we live in today, and translates our problems into higher concepts. While the idea of [chemical substance]-induced ""numbness"" is an interesting one to explore, it rubbed off on the performances and photography too much. The script is dull and pretentious, and develops as intelligently as Mortal Kombat. ""Let's get this character from point A to B and then have him fight and move on."" This film is dumb, boring, uninspired, pretentious, slow, illogical, too ""serious"" and an otherwise complete waste of time. I wish the film's interesting concept had been developed by a less self-important personality with an actual grasp of story and character development.I wholeheartedly recommend watching director Kurt Wimmer's director's commentary on this thing, though ... That ... track makes this DVD worthwhile. ..."
4,wierd,"the storyline was by far out there...very strange and confusing at times....especially if u dont like to think like me...lol...but the action scenes were well worth watching...creative...numerous times i said to myself: ""i never saw that...""buy a 2pm showtime...enter at 2:45...you'll be satisfied:)"
4,"Good, but not great","Equilibrium's ""gun kata"" totally reminded me of ""The Matrix."" Despite the few flaws I found, because I had no expectations of it, I think I was able to appreciate it more as a result.The soundtrack was well scored though."
3,Very derivitive,"The movie was okay in itself, but for virtually the entire viewing I felt I was watching scenes that were re done from other movies. I saw Metropolis, V is for Vendetta, The Matrix, Ultraviolet and Logan's Run to name some of them. It wasn't a bad film, but there was nothing original in it and some of the ""spectacular gun battles and fight scenes"" described on the box were simply laughable in their execution. All in all, I would recommend watching it, but I question those who say they fell in love with this film or those that state this is the greatest film of all time. It was an hour and 47 minutes of fair entertainment. Not great - not terrible. Just a nice diversion."
2,Calm Down Its Not That Good,"Come on everyone, calm down. This after all is an average/ok film. Its not better than the Matrix, its not even in the same league. It is however ridiculously derivative of the Matrix, lets face it, it would not exist if the Matrix had not been made.Yeah its ok - Bale is good but then he's a good actor. The fight scenes are sometimes a bit silly, but sometimes entertaining. Its a low budget Matrix wannabe. If you view it like that then you may enjoy it.Its like every Steven Seagal or Van Damme film, rips off a genre and never quite makes it out of the B-List, straight to DVD category."
5,Canadian Import vs. U.S. DVD release Comparison,"Originally, I saw a review that stated that the Canadian release of Equilibrium removed the black bars and zoomed in on the picture. This is not so. Though both the U.S. DVD release and the Canadian release state 2.35:1, only the Canadian Import version delivers. The DVD does have black bars, but those black bars cut some of the image off. The Canadian release, by Alliance, removed the black bars and presents the whole picture, which looks pretty good. The sound is also excellent. Though both the picture and the sound can be improved upon, it's a nice addition to any sci-fi or action blu-ray library, if this is your type of genre. But again, the Canadian import includes more of the original image, not less of it."
2,The Matrix This Is Not,"Although the concluding final scene is pretty good, this movie was dry and the plot was not worthy of being compared to the Matrix or even Gattaca, another futuristic plot favorite of mine. Bale holds his own and Diggs is decent. The concept was original but just not enough. Ok movie but it's not the Matrix."
3,Decent,The condition of the movie was not as it was described. It came to me with damage to the clear protector on the case. And the plastic wrapping was torn.
2,Nice the second time...,"I have seen this movie for the second time and, I can say...I have changed my mind about it...I dont think it is as horrible as I described it the first time, but I still think it's pathetic to have the slogan :""FORGET THE MATRIX!"" In it's cover!The story is quiet good, and the acting OK, but it took me 2 times to realize this...I recommend you this movie, but if you have not seen The Matrix trilogy, buy the 3 (The Matrix, Reloaded, Revolutions) now!!!Dont you ever forget The Matrix!!!!"
2,An Equilibrium of the Bowels,"This book makes my bowels settle every time I read it, and it's not even a book! It's a movie, and a movie is ultimately what it is and all it has to give."
3,poor man's matirx/minority report,"The action sequences were very entertaining. Otherwise, the movie could be pulled apart if you wanted to get into the theory of it."
5,Awesome action movie (but odd).,"My husband rented this and we loved it. So I bought a copy to send to a friend. Set in the future and a bit violent so not for those who are squeamish. But the gun kata is amazing, has several good twists that are unexpected and Christian Bales gives a knock-out performance as an assassin who decides to stop supressing his emotions. Best surprise beyond the gun kata - the son's behavior during a police raid of the house, and Christian Bale's reaction to a dog he finds."
3,An Okay Movie,"Equilibrium is a movie that portrays a world where human emotion is forbidden. Society is vaccinated with serums to suppress and control human feeling. When one militaristic elite misses his required dose he discovers the beauty of human emotion. Armed by his emotions he decides to destroy the ""Big Brother"" system he once protected.The overall concept of the movie sounds interesting; however, the lines and overall story plot were shallow. The characters in the movie lacked depth. It seemed like the director just wanted to focus on the fighting scenes rather than showing any meaningful dialogue between the characters.The fighting sequences were pretty amazing though. They were artistic and compared to most action movies very unique.The movie was not as amazing as I expected but at the same time not a complete disappointment."
4,It is pretty good,"the movie itself have a very powerful and deep meaning to it. It was meant for the audience to think about their feelings that they take for granted. To persude the audience to think in an odd way. to proclaim to that world is not based on what you see or do, but on what you feel.I have not seen Far...heit 451, so i have no right to make any comparsion, but I have seen the Matrix, and the Matrix Reload. Compared between the two movie, each has it ups and downs. The Matix is very deep and complix, its fights are based on the speed of the character. Because the Neo (the main character) is supernaturally faster than the nake eye can see. the movie gives u a slow motion point of view. On the other hand, John Preston (the main character of Equilibrium) is not superfast,but he is fast. Not too fast, that you need a slow motion point of view, but fast. His accuarties is very..."
2,Fahrenheit 451 with guns...,"...and a cute little puppy dog. I had to give up on this hackneyed drivel after an hour, but I have a suspicion that the hero ends up overthrowing the evil emotion-repressing dictatorship. High school English teachers with a crush on Christian Bale no doubt love this film; the rest of us will only be reminded of the many other films and books from which it derived its ideas."
1,Euilibrium = No Go,"I saw it on tv. For the first 30 minutes, I didn't like it. When it was over, I still didn't like it. Even with the fight scenes, I didn't like it."
2,"""Matrix"" wannabe",This movie tanked in the theaters and with good reason-the story and special effects are lame.
1,"Can we say ""knock-off""?","Honestly, I don't have much to say, except for that was the biggest waste of my time ever! Such a knock-off movie! Remind you of The Matrix at all? Un-humanly people (i.e. agents), underworlds (i.e. Zion), and a hero who can handle them all (i.e. Neo)... Yeah, Christian Bale should never attempt an action figure/hero role again! Biggest piece of crap ever made!"
1,GARBAGE,"THIS MOVIE IS SO STUPID, WHOEVER THOUGHT OF PUTTING THAT LINE SAYING FORGET ABOUTH THE MATRIX ON THE BOTTOM SHOULD BE SMACKED. THIS MOVIE MADE NO SENSE WHATSOEVER, CRISTIAN BALE LOOKS LIKE A BOGUS NEO. THE PLOT WAS SO STUPID (ITS ILLIGEAL TO HAVE FEELING OF ANY KIND)WHAT TYPE OF GARBAGE IS THIS IT MADE NO SENSE DOESNT SMILING REPRESENT EMOTION WHICH I SAW THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE, THE FIGHT SCENES WERE SO FAKE AND THEY WERE BLOODY AND GOREY, THE FINAL FIGHT SCENE BETWEEN CHRISTIAN BALE AND TAYE DIGGS WAS SO SHORT YOU WOULD EXPECT IT TO BE MORE LONGER AND MORE EXCITING THAN IT WAS BUT INSTEAD TAYE DIGGS GETS HALF OF HIS FACE CHOPPED OFF WITHIN A MINUTE OF THE FIGHT. DONT BUY THIS MOVIE THERE ARE PLENTY OF MOVIES THAT DIDNT MAKE IT TO THE BIG SCREEN THAT ARE BETTER THAN THIS CRAP."
4,Mr. Yochum's 5/6 Senior English Class.,"Mr. Yochum's 5/6 Senior English Class.I thought that Equilibrium was a great movie. There was a lot of action in the movie. I thought that Christian Bale was great in this movie. I also found his character John Preston to be very interesting. I found many similarities between this movie and the book 1984 by George Orwell. For instance they both have a figure that is all powerful whether it is Father or Big Brother. Furthermore in the movie and book the main character ends up having ""feeling"" which in there societies they are not suppose to have. Also in the book and movie there are children that work for the government and turn adults in for not following the government's beliefs. The only difference between the two is that in the book the government wins, but in the movie the government is overturned. Lastly, I found the movie to be a great thrill."
3,Been Here Seen This,"EQUILIBRIUM offers an entertaining rehash of movies that have gone before, most notably the ideological concept of FAHRENHEIT 451 mixed with a gun toting version of the wire fu martial arts action of THE MATRIX. It asks the question is peace among all mankind worth any price we have to pay--even a total loss of emotional experiences? While the film offers very little that is truly new but it is a pleasant way to pass the time and may be thought provoking if you haven't seen FAHRENHEIT or the countless other films with similar themes. There are a couple of twists and turns that make it fairly interesting. For further information read any of the scores of reviews by people who cared more about this Christian Bale flick than I did."
5,BETTER THAN THE MATTRIX,"I FIRST WATCHED THIS WITH MY HUSBAND NOT BEING AN ACTION MOVIE BUFF. BUT WHEN IT FIRST STARTED I COULDN'T TAKE MY EYES OFF THE T.V. BEING A NUMBER 1 CHRISTIAN BALE FAN THE MOVIE SUITED HIM IN ALL WAYS. THE ACTION WITH THE GUNS WERE SUPPER, NO FEELINGS AT FIRST HE WAS AN A-1 KILLER THEN HE STARTS TO FEEL AND AFTER CATCHING A WOMEN PRISONER WHO WAS FEELING I THINK HE WAS FALLING FOR HER, BUT COULDN'T MAKE IT IN TIME TO STOP HER DEATH SO HE GOES AHEAD WITH THE UNDERGROUND AND TAKES EQUILIBRIUM OUT. OH HES GOOD REALLY GOOD THE SPECIAL AFFECTS WERE AWSOME. THE WHOLE MOVIE WAS AWSOME IF YOU DONT OWN THIS ONE YOU BETTER GET IT.......HEY CHRISTIAN BALE IF YOU READ THIS PLEASE DO ME A FAVOR? MAKE A ROMANCE MOVIE SOMETHING SEXY.....LOL OVER AND OUT."
5,Good cult film,"I should really only give this four stars but it is pretty enjoyable and better than most so why not. If you like films like gattica, thx-1138, 1984, farenheit 451, matrix, you will like this film. It is not a big budget number and has a slightly deflated end, but all in all it's a stylishly done film with good acting and an interesting speculative fantasy plot. Christain Bale looks like a bit like Joseph Goebbels in it to me also i thought."
2,NOT 5.1 sound!!!!!,do not buy this version i agree with the review above. i have it and it is 2 channel only
2,Mr. Yochum's 13-14 English Class,"This film appears to have been made within minutes of the director finishing the novel 1984. The plot scheme and motifs in Equilibrium are almost identical to those found in George Orwell's classic. However, in an attempt to make the story more contemporary, this work resorted to excess gun violence and underground dealings as cheap thrills for a certain age demographic. Probably the most painful ting to watch is the acting; the dramatic stances and mundane voices just scream ""Matrix"" and come off as a very poor performance. The overall aspect of the film was enjoyable to watch if you don't exactly want to witness something more creative and just want the ""SparkNotes"" version of 1984.In short, you will enjoy this film if you liked the book 1984 and don't want to watch something that builds upon it. But if you are a diehard Orwell and 1984 fan, this is the film to pass up."
2,The dog was cute.,"Equilibrium starring Christian Bale is kinda like The Matrix but the message of the film falls flat. The martial arts and special effects were lame but the acting is good thanks to Bale (but he wears too much make-up). The middle of the movie is the best, especially that adorable pup. Overall, I found this sci-fi flick a snoozer."
2,ok,"I was shocked to see the high rating review this movie got from it's viewers. My overall feel of the movie is...it's boring. The plot had the potential to be good, I have seen almost all the utopian films out there and I had high hopes for this film. The acting is good, Christian Bale always gives a great performance but unfortunately the plot lacks.Overall it was an Ok movie but nothing I would watch again."
5,Equilibrium,"In a futuristic world, a strict regime has eliminated war by suppressing emotions: books, art and music are strictly forbidden and feeling is a crime punishable by death. Cleric John Preston is a top ranking government agent responsible for destroying those who resist the rules. Whe he misses a dose of Prozium, a mind-altering drug that hinders emotion, Preston, who has been trained to enforce the strict laws of the new regime, suddenly becomes the only person capable of overthrowing it. ""Equilibrium"" is basically a progression from a fairly complex sci-fi film. The cast does an excellent job of portraying characters in this movie. ""Equilibrium"" is meant as entertainment. And entertain it does. It does it so very well. It mixes action and with substantial plot and original style to make an excellent movie."
1,Do Not Buy This Blu-ray!,"Another Echo Bridge Blu-ray, another crappy 1080p transfer. Equilibrium arrive on high-def with a presentation that would be slightly above-average in terms of detail quality and color consistency... if it weren't for its damned aspect ratio. Cropped to 1.78:1, the film might as well be pan-and-scan.The specs Amazon is showing is not correct."
3,Mr. Yochum's 3/4 Senior English Class,"I didn't think this movie was that bad. It was very similar to the book, 1984. They both had main characters who rebelled against the acceptable way of life. They both also had a love story intertwined into their plot. In both, loving someone was against the rules. And eventually they were both caught in the action. I liked the setting of the movie because it made the movie more interesting. It also made the movie more suspenseful. On the other hand, I didn't think that the acting was very good. It just looked too fake. For instance, at the end of the movie, it looked like he was just waving his arms around and everyone was falling over and dying. The fighting just wasn't as good as I thought it would be. But other than that, I thought everything else was pretty interesting."
2,Some similarities,"I would just add to my last review of this today - to the guy who said that people who said its a Matrix rip-off should be shot (anger management issues?) Peter, and Ian who said what the hell does this film have to the matrix let me try to enlighten;- The lighting- The wearing of all in one dark long coats- The martial arts- The gunplay- The agents of the state concept- An oppressive unseen master- The post holocaust world- Rebellion against the illusion the masses live their lives unerIs that enough.....?The storyline that everyone keep saying was fantastic was thin. The ""final battle"" was a complete anti-climax.Look, its an moderately entertaining couple of hours in a low budget B movie kind of way. Lets not try to pretend its Lord Of The Rings, or even the Matrix!"
5,underrateddumporama,this movie should'nt have been in limited release. i tell all my friends about it and 2 this day they are telling all of there friends. possibly the best of 2002. this movie was not a matrix rip-off but just pure movie magic. equilibrium has set the standard 4 action and sci-fi. a must own dvd and u can take that 2 the bank!!!
5,"Awesome, It's Hitler on steroids...a must see!!!","I was expecting this movie to be like The Matrix. Only two things resembled The Matrix, one was a shoot out scene and the other is they wore coats that resembled Keanu Reeves' coat. Other than that, it's not living in a computer world or anything like that type movie. I kept expecting someone to wake up only to realize their entire life was a dream. Finally I figured out it wasn't meant to be a computer/dream type movie. Once I realized that, I was able to enjoy the movie even better.This movie is amazing. I love the fight scenes and the flow the movie is near perfect. It is very well directed and the acting is top-notch! I can't think of anything I didn't like about this movie...well one thing, a couple of the fight scenes could have been a bit longer. But even the short fighting scenes are still very effective.A+ kudos for an excellent movie, which will never leave my DVD collection, I recommend it to any Sci-Fi and/or Thriller fans."
1,Special effects might be good at that time but not good compared to movies of the last 3 years + So so acting + Typical plot,Special effects might be good at that time but not good compared to movies of the last 3 years + So so acting + Typical plot = Not good.
1,"Can you say ""Rip-Off!""???","I just finished watching this movie-and in order to try to do the review justice-I actually sat through the whole thing-(just like when I tolerated sitting through 'Moulin Rouge'). -And Can you say....umm ""RIP-OFF""!!?? From the Matrix, Resident Evil, and the book ""Brave New World""? Save yourself the money and time from watching this silly knock-off from the aforementioned movies/books-and go see/read the real things. Believe-me you are not missing anything."
1,This is what a bad movie looks like!!!!!!!!!,"This is a really bad movie. Do not waste your money or time with it. If I could give it a negative star rating, I would.The premise of the film isn't original at all. I watched, waiting for a final twist, but it ended in the usual way. To compare this to the Matrix is an insult. It also trys to compare itself to Minority report. This does not ring true either."
1,Good Names - Bad Plot,"There are an awful lot of well-known actors in this movie: Christian Bale, Sean Bean, Taye Diggs, Emily Watson, Angus MacFadyen, William Fichtner..... *Sigh* What a Waste.The plot (such as it is) is that Bale, Bean, and Diggs are something-or-other `Clerics' in a futuristic world; their job is to slaughter anyone with feelings. Preposterous, especially since the movie is filled with them constantly saying things like ""I think"", ""I want"", etc - ALL EMOTIONS! Duh!Full of self-congratulatory flashy camera shots that are obviously trying to imitate The Matrix (Too bad Bale didn't play Neo, he can actually act AND he looks better in the black soutane) Would probably be bearable as a comic book - But as it is - I commend your strong stomach if you can sit through to the ridiculous end."
2,"B-Movie plot that tries too hard, wrapped around nice visuals.","This is a B-Movie plot that doesnt know its a B-Movie plot. It tries too hard to be relevant and serious, when its all a bit silly. You cant help but be knocked over the head by the intellectual points the film tries to make. So in the end all the plot and seriousness does is take you out of the film and make the whole thing seem a bit silly.The visuals are great, and action is great. If a bit too derivative of the Matrix.Really what is action though if you cant get into the movie? Its all a bit empty.And at final blush this movie doesnt capture you, so its all a bit of a wasted effort."
3,The Matrix meets George Orwell,"This is an enjoyable, if not very original, movie about a society in the near future that has decided it can avoid war by suppressing human emotions. Everyone is required to inject themselves with a Prozac-like drug that greatly reduces feelings. Art is outlawed, and Christian Bale plays a leader of a team whose job is to go around finding art and destroying it and those harboring it. I found that aspect of the story to be a (perhaps unintentional) metaphor for the current failed War on Drugs.It's hard to imagine a totalitarian future that's not influenced by George Orwell, and this film is no exception.There are several well-done fight scenes which are heavily influenced by The Matrix, with excessive gunplay, impossible martial arts moves, and even a leather-clad main character."
5,Great genre film..you wont be sorry...,"I own this film and have shared it with several friends who did not even know it existed.It is a great popcorn flick with an interesting plot and message.Well worth the time and money...buy it or rent it, you won't be sorry."
4,Highly stylized,"This a highly stylized and improved remake of ""Farenheit 451"". The former film is dry and devoid of emotion while this one makes the audience feel and miss emotions. Christian Bale and his nemesis Taye Diggs wear the stylized Matrix-esque motif extremely well. Both are well cast for their roles. The tongue-n-cheek finale is well worth the wait. In other words the pay off is worth the efforts of controlling your ADD urges and sitting thru the entire film. :-)"
2,Corny,I thought this movie was corny. Bale redeemed himself with me with Terminator and the Batman Trilogy. I would pass.
5,Sick Movie,Great movie with tons of cool fight scenes. The only mistake the producers made was releasing this movie around the same timeframe as the Matrix which made this movie seem like a knock-off. They are actually two very different flicks and this one is nearly as good as the Matrix.
5,Love it.,Great martial arts sci-fi movie. I like to watch it in slow-mo too. Great commentary on society.
3,It's ok,"I'm surprised at all the rave reviews. It's really nothing special. The movie is about how humans have decided to be without emotion, with the help of a drug, so they never get angry enough to go to war again. How good can a movie be when everyone walks around without any emotion?"
3,"yo!, this was 'aight","this was a cool action flick. I wouldnt of watched it if Christian Bale wasnt in it. I watched him in this and it looked like he was gonna blow up with all that Matrix like fighting. Taye Diggs is ""aight also. I recomend this if you are atrue action fan and if you want to see MAtrixripoffmoves, which are 'aight also. a cool groove of a movie"
2,Boring,"Don't know why people like this movie so much. Can't remember anthing about this movie I liked. In fact, I don't remember anything from this movie at all."
2,Equilibrium,Meh. If you can't find a better sci fi movie then determine how severely you need a sic fi fix. This one might be better than nothing.
5,"Fantastic movie, so no sequels, please.","I think most everyone who saw Equilibrium would agree it was the most pleasant surprise of 2002. It's first-rate entertainment that pretty much had it all: a solid story, a stellar cast, visually appealing sets, and the most wildly thrilling action sequences of its kind since The Matrix.Thus, it is inevitable, especially considering the movie was financed by Dimension Films, the purveyor of realising schlock straight-to-video releases, that a direct-to-video sequel will be proposed to cash in on this movie's burgeoning fan base. As a huge fan of Equilibrium, I cannot emphasize what a terrible idea that would be. This is a movie that clearly concluded its story and left just enough for viewers to chew on their own time. Don't disgrace this film with unnecessary sequels."
5,Equilibrium equal to my expectations,This movie is simply fantastic. It has many different types of action from futuristic gun-play to sword-play. this being set in the future has to have the type of Choreography needed to satisfy the future fan. it's not only an action its story is eqally captivating in character development as time progress. plain and simple buy this.
5,Better than Matrix?,"I REALLY enjoy this movie. In some ways I prefer it over Matrix. Equilibrium is a combination for Fahrenheit 451 and 1984. The world it creates is stark and ""peaceful,"" at the expense of emotion and art.The acting is well done, the action sequences are mesmerizing (the last fight scene between Bale and the main protagonist is one of the coolest [and never-before-done] gun fight scenes), and the plot is fascinating.Some people seem to think it is a rip-off of Matrix. I highly disagree. It stands on its own. I definitely recommend that you watch this movie."
3,Mr. Yochum's 5/6 Senior English Class,"The movie Equilibrium was a decent movie, not a great one, but not a movie you would regret seeing. It follows the plot of George Orwell's famous novel ""1984"" very closely with the idea of a distopian society and is extremely similar to the novel 1984. Like 1984, the main character in Equilibrium rebels against the established government and society. The movie's heavy action and ""Matrix"" like scenes add entertainment, but they do get tiring after awhile. The movie is interesting and the plot is well developed. The progression of the main character is also very evident throughout the movie. The important thing is that the movie stays interesting and does have any real slow parts. However, I was not a fan of the ending, which I felt was very unrealistic(even though dodging bullets is not very realistic either). The movie is better than average, but nothing spectacular."
4,balanced,A balanced production with the challenge of Minority report and the special effects of the Matrix. A nice blend of action thriller and mystery genre.
3,Mindless Fun,"Equilibrium is a great flick to pick up if you want to just kick back and watch a pseudo mindless action film. Obviously, if you delve too deeply into trying to examine all the various nuances of the characters, plot, or action (ex. How come all the rebels die like flies in the beginning when they were supposedly some fairly well outfitted resistence cells? After a torch is taken to the Mona Lisa [which is also a few square feet too large in comparison to the real deal] the painting sits as if nothing is burning? How is it that the gun kata were to make any semblence of sense [being as a normally trained gun-wielding individual would probably not be trying to shoot at random vectors, but rather DIRECTLY AT a target]?)And the questions go on and on ...However, none of this really matters if you just sit back and relax, and take it as the mind-numbing action flick that it is.Enjoy!"
5,"Amazing, Modern Classic! Most Original Movie of the Year","This movie was an amazing movie. The entire theatre jumped and cheered in awe of certain ""gunkata"" scenes. The story of the movie was an adaptation of some old classic movie scripts and books but in a very original way. They seemed to be working under a tight budget for scenery but it just added to the cold hard feeling of the set. Also what may at first seem like to be a hole in the movies plot turns out to have been a clue to the real situation. This movie is definetly worth owning and make sure you show it to everyone you have over because unless you tell them they probably will never even know of it's existence. This movie got no commercial marketing at all. Once you see it you will want everyone to see it so you can agree on how good it was."
4,Did anyone else notice the huge plot hole?!,"With everyone debating whether its a copy or good action film I'm really suprised nobody pointed out that they accidently put two scenes in the wrong order! I won't mention what they are, 'cause it destroys the purpose of the film.The scene order aside, it is an excellent film. Made even more so by the quality produced on such a low budget. I highly recomend the viewing of this work."
4,At least theres action...,"i must admit, i was a little aprehesive about this movie at first, cause all the first half hour was (minus one really cool action scene) was a rip off of the Matrix, Farenheit 451, 1984, and Brave New World. had i been rating the originality of this movie, it would be a one. but i'm not, i'm rating whether or not it was fun. and it was. it has some very original action sequences. to me, that was what made the movie. the story was sub-par (bordering on annoying...) but i felt the action made up for it. some people can accept this, some people can't. thats fine. you will either love this movie, or hate it. i loved it. i thought the action was on level with that of the Matrix, and each fight scene was completely different than the rest. all in all worth at least watching, but i don't guarantee you'll like it. just don't expect too much out of the story..."
5,A True Masterpiece of action and Drama!,It is truely sad that Demension films basicly droped this film. If it had recieved wide scale advertisement i believe it would have been a great success at the box office. This is a Sci-Fi adventure that rivals the classics. This movie is not only a marvel of action but of the true depths of the soul as well. A truely great movie and one of my all time favorite films.
1,Never Buy This Waste Blu-Ray,"Never, Never, Never Buy This.Video - This blu-ray is 1.78:1, by cutting 2.35:1`s side!Sound - This blu-ray has only one sound track,This track is 2.0ch, not 5.1ch!!!Special Features - Nothing.Subtitles - Nothing.This blu-ray is not blu-ray. It is only waste.Never waste your money and time.The Best Media of Equilibrium is DVD until NOW!"
2,Get the other Blu-ray version,This new blu-ray has horrid video encoding and audio mixes. There is another one on amazon that has the 5.1 Dolby Digital and true 2.35:1 aspect ratio. It still isn't the best (the japan release has the best audio mixes.) But it is better than this one.Equilibrium [Blu-ray] That's the one I got. It is the Canadian release done by Alliance(has double sided box art one in english one in french) and is actually good.
4,Ultra Cool Gun Battles!,"This movie features not only the most impressive gunfight sequences in recent movie history but also some very stylish swordfighting scenes. An outstanding performance by Christian Bale (American Psycho, Reign of Fire) made it all the more enjoyable. His convincing portrayal of the highest ranking Grammaton Cleric, an unfeeling, unemotional, near superhuman killing machine, draws you into the post-apocalyptic, prozac nation of Libria very quickly.Initially, the set designs took me aback; it wasn't as polished as the costume designs but that's quite understandable given the movie's budget. It's definitely no Minority Report nor The Matrix in terms of production quality but it succeeds in bringing its own memorable flavor. Despite the premise and some pretty weak moments along the way, I found myself being entertained by this little gem of a sci-fi action flick. Don't miss it!"
2,A Mindless Matrix,"Equilibrium strives to be a hybrid of Fahrenheit 451, 1984 and The Matrix. Unfortunately, it lacks the powerful social commentary of Fahrenheit 451 and 1984 and fails to achieve the technical mastery and philosophical underpinnings of The Matrix. In reality, director Kurt Wimmer has merely remade Logan's Run with the stylistic sensibilty of The Matrix. He should have called the movie Neo's Run.Sure, the gun fights are cool, Christian Bale is effective as a poor man's Neo and I actually enjoyed this movie. However, it is absolutely absurd to suggest that this movie even approaches the literary or cinematic greatness of the aforementioned titles. The sets are cheap, the CGI is poor, the costumes are cheesey and Taye Diggs is absolutely abysmal.In short, Equilibrium draws inspiration from a broad spectrum of superior sources and ends up being nothing more than a bit of mindless fun."
3,the fight scenes are SO RIDICULOUS LOL,"hello there! the story of this movie is great! ppl with no emotions! a perfect world! I remembered demolition man when I noticed the concept of the movie! the actors are not bad at all and the movie is good! not a problem with that..but the FIGHT SCENES ARE SIMPLY RIDICULOUS! lolol what a matrix rip off!! swords and bullets everywhere lol simple stupidity! I guess 12 year olds will love it! lol when are they gonna make some movie that's 1% good as pulp fiction, 8 mm or shawshank redemption....."
2,not so much.,"I found this film to be derivative in every possible way. It's not a terrible film, but it is not impressive, either."
1,infuriatingly moronic,"The thing I couldn't get past with this movie was the premise. It seemed like a thinly-veiled ripoff of the ""books are banned"" premise from Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451. Only there, the premise worked. Here, the premise is that emotion has been banned.I couldn't buy this for a second. According to the movie, emotion is caused by things such as old lamps, paintings, and carpets. In reality, since emotions are caused by, say, having a baby, getting a promotion at work, watching the rain in the afternoon, whatever -- they would be difficult to ban. Or, if they wanted to ban them, they'd have to go about it in an entirely different way from the method employed in this movie: antique sofas are now banned, so the public won't be emotional?Beyond that, there was a lot of unnecessary kung-fu, whose connection to the issue of emotional suppression raised by the plot was not clear to me."
3,alright movie.,Christian Bale does an amazing job in this movie and the idea behind it is very clever. some of the action scenes seem to be a little too cheesy. but still well worth watching once
2,Received late for Christmas,"The movie I received is fine, my problem is that I ordered this movie on 12/18/08, I was guaranteed delivery by 12/24/08, in time for Christmas. I did not receive the movie until 12/30/08! I will never order on Amazon.com again!"
3,Stands on its own as a film. So-So DVD,"The theater going audience is pretty fickle (although not discriminating) these days and it is easy to see why this movie was ignored in limited release. It was not made for mass appeal. People who love action and understand suspension of belief will enjoy this film. The distributors probably made a poor decision in comparing it to the Matrix. As a relatively low budget sci fi film, it stands on its own. This movie is great entertainment but the audience must understand two things. First, the director himself said that the society was not truly emotionless as emotion is an essential part of being human. The drug in the film merely removed the highs and lows. Maintaining ""equilibrium"" is a matter of societal influence and the Clerics. Second, all movies build on previous films. Whether it be production techniques, actors, or stories, without the foundations of previous work, we wouldn't have great movies like Charlie's Angels II. Just kidding."
1,Warning: Aspect Ratio Not As Advertised Here,"Before you buy this import, you should know that this film has been modified from its theatrical 2.35-1 aspect ratio to 1.77-1 -- this even though the the Blu-ray case says 2.35-1 as well. Needless to say, I'm returning this purchase. Amazon, you REALLY ought to correct this information."
2,"It Worked For Me, But...","My copy of this game worked OK after some initial bugginess, so I do not share the same concerns expressed by the earlier review.I guess my concern is that even the fully-functional version is not highly playable. Once you run through the play scenarios, which honestly does not take all that long, you end up in ""sandbox"" mode, which is highly repetitive and does not contain many variations.On the plus side, the animations and graphics are fun, and the diseases and equipment are witty, too.Keep your money in your pocket - at least until the developers come up with something much more variegated and playable than this is."
3,Better Version,This game has grown over the years. This version has much better graphics and game play. Nothing to go up against some of the newer games but fun never the less.
2,Theme Hospital is So Much Better,This game was very boring because there was hardly any challenge at all and there's not much to do. Get Theme Hospital instead. The promotional materials make a big deal about how the doctors have different personalities but this doesn't seem to affect game play in any way.
2,Much less fun than Theme Hospital,"I played this game in storymode for a day or two. Here are my main points of criticism:* There is an aerial view, but you can't use it to place new rooms.* Staff is hard to direct; you can't just pick them up and place them where they're needed.* The music is unimaginative and the assistant's Sims-like jabbering very annoying.* You can't speed up a patient's progress through the hospital by moving them up in the queue.* The cutscenes are too long and have little to do with what you're trying to accomplish.* You have no influence on how funds are spent.All in all the game is rather unchallenging (at least in storymode). You don't really have to manage the hospital. Once you have built the required rooms and staffed it, it basically runs itself (although that might be different in other game modes).Although it is much older, Theme Hospital is much more fun to play. I wish they'd come out with an updated version!"
1,I hope I'm not the only one this happened to...,"None of the reviews mention it, the product specifications don't mention it, and the picture of the jewel case is too small to see it...but this game is meant for ""PC-DVD"" play, which I didn't find out until I received the package and saw the label clearly in the lower left corner. Not all of us have DVD-ROM drives! My computer couldn't even read the disk! I'm always careful to read the specifications before I purchase a computer program; if I'd realized my computer didn't fit the bill I wouldn't have bought the game."
1,Burnt out my USB hub,"On paper the product looked great. And the box is small and sleek. But when my drive arrived and I followed the directions and plugged it into my USB hub I got complaints from my usb bus along the lines of 'voltage overload'. And I smelt a burning plastic. It never worked, and I think my hub and one of the ports on my USB card are now burnt out. I was not impressed."
5,Suerte,"Este albúm de Shakira, es de lo mejor de lo mejor del mercado internacional, ya que convina de forma magistral sentimiento y rítmo."
3,Entertaining and Thought Provoking,"This collection of articles by former pot smuggler and convict Richard Stratton, shows his talent as a gritty and skilled writer. The subject matter is drawn from articles from ""Prison Life"", ""High Times"" and other edgy magazines. He does get you to think about the problems with the drug laws and the prison system, but the constant conspiracy theories gets a little hard to swallow. An interesting read, if you like the darker side of the law."
4,Review of Altered States by R. Stratton,"This book is a collection of articles and essays written by Mr. Stratton over many years. It was helpful that the author dated the essays in the table of contents.Mr. Stratton seems very knowledgeable about his subject matter. His articles help place in historical context the people, mostly men, who were dominant figures in organised crime in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s.I find organized crime interesting. It subverts the dominant culture, it manipulates the dominant culture, and it is a subculture of secrets that is paradox to the dominant culture.Mr. Stratton's writing style is conversational and topical. Although at times I longed for more profundity,I understand that this may not have been Mr. Stratton's style or purpose.I will read more of Mr. Stratton's writings, not because of his writing style or literary skills, but to learn more about the times of which he writes and the characters who people these times."
5,this is my six year old son's favorite cd,"I used to pop this cd in when driving long distances with child in tow. It's a great sing along record, Jake's voice is so beautiful. The back-up band is all-female and acoustic: stand up bass, drum, and violin - with Jake on guitar. The lyrics are great, especially Alibi and Going Through the Motions. My kid asked me what type of music this was and I really could't find a box to put it in, but I'll try. This is rock and roll after hours"
4,solid set,"""Keep a Secret"" doesn't have definitive tracks like ""Fingerprint"" or ""Downhill"" on ""Come Clean,"" but it's quite pleasing throughout, and some of the songs only lack a little stronger lyrics to elevate them from ""catchy"" to ""great"" - especially ""Kira's Coming Over"" and ""I Guess I'm in Luck."" ""Hesitate,"" ""Into the Light,"" and ""Shaking"" are good fun, and there's plenty more. Four stars because the album doesn't quite reach the standard of ""Come Clean,"" but of course this is some of the best music that's come out of the decade."
5,"I love this book, book, book!","I love this book, book, book! Sure it's a good joke (one that Debbie Bruss has creatively adapted for children), but it's also a delightful story about finding entertainment and pleasure in the pages of a book. Tiphanie Beekman's illustrations are warm and engaging, simple but not simplistic, sweet, with fun details (watch for the ladybug and the mouse). The language is pleasing and direct and offers opportunities for kid participation. Parents and children alike will reach for this smile-provoking book again and again - as will teachers and librarians - it's a beautiful tool for demonstrating what Book! Book! Book! readers already know: sharing a good story is FUN!"
1,A joke,"This is honestly the worst, most difficult, and messiest gingerbread house kit I have had the unfortunate experience of dealing with. The kids will probably have a good time.... if they're 2. Honestly, stay away. The frosting has a very bitter taste, and make your own frosting. Gross. Yeah, a good product if your a professional cake decorator that wants to decorate the smallest gingerbread house ever. Honestly, it's a joke of a product. Deserves a zero."
2,No certificate of occupancy,"If it were a real house, this structure would have been condemned! I suppose, given there were instructions on how to repair damage, I should not have been surprised when three of the six pieces of this gingerbread house came severely damaged. It did make for an entertaining few days as we struggled to get the pieces to remain intact once they were repaired, even calling upon my son-in-law who is a contractor to help shore up the collapsing house. But I'll never buy one of these kits again - think I'll stick with using graham crackers. I will say, though, that the amount of icing was more than adequate and the candy plentiful."
1,Broken all to pieces,"I bought my kit at Walmart. The pieces were broken and I had to throw the whole mess in the trash and buy a different brand of gingerbread house to decorate. Save yourself a headache and avoid this one. If I could give it a zero, I would."
3,3 ok one broken,I ordered 4 houses...3 of them where fine but one arrived broken. Other than that it was a fun activity.
1,"Doesn't stay hot long, and doesn't last long.","This neck wrap was okay for about a week. A few issues with it:1. When heated, it doesn't get very warm, and it doesn't stay hot for very long - maybe 10 minutes at most. According to the instructions, it must cool down completely before reheating.2. After a few uses, heated according to the directions, it began to smell burnt - not very pleasant.3. After a few weeks of use, I removed it from the microwave after heating it up for 2 minutes, and it was smoking and had 2 holes burned through it.I'll be shopping for a different neck wrap..."
1,bad odor,"These things stink so bad it almost makes me puke. Really though, the smell is so overpowering and it's not even a good smell to begin with."
5,"Good sound, excellent longevity.","I've had these speakers now for about four years and they still work just as great as the day I got them. An excellent value for your money and they last a long time! They sound very good if you simply use an equalizer on your computer. I am an audiophile and I can honestly say, these speakers don't sound that bad. The best part is, they never get distorted, no matter how loud you turn them. But generally, at very high volumes, the satellites can actually drown out the sub. My only gripe with these speakers is no headphone jack on the main satellite. Other than that, great system. Couldn't be more pleased- worth every penny."
3,Not really pleased...,"Don't get excited when you purchase these. Most people purchases this pair of speakers in hopes that it's going to sound like Kurt Cobain is still alive and actually talking to you.But the truth is, it is just an entry level set of speakers. I bought these, and the bass is just too boomy. I'm not an audiophile, but I know when things sound terrible. They did.As for the satellites, if you get too close to them, you hear a choppy wave sound. It turned me off from them.I recommend that if you are going to be spending between twenty to forty dollars on a pair of entry level speakers that you look into Creative."
5,Very Good Speakers,I just bought a new souped up computer and I couldn't stand the two speakers that came with it. I went looking around and I am very cheap and wanted to get surround sound on sale but I saw these speakeras at Staples for the highest price.... I instantly decided to buy these and I wouldn't want a different kind. These speaker swere easy to install. WITHIN FIVE MINUTES I HAD THESE SPEAKERS RUNNING!!!!!!!!!!! I would recomend these speakers to my friends and any person who wants to experience the ultimate desktop experience.
4,Excellent speaker system!,"Well, I saw an ad in OfficeMax for these speakers and I picked them up. I previously owned the Z-340's and since these were the same price, I returned my Z-340's and got these for a free upgrade to 4.1!! Anyway, that's beside the point. For the price, these speakers KICK ...!! 4.1 surround with M3D for older games and music sounds great. The sub is easily the best feature of the set. Only 20 watts, yet it cranks out some serious power!! Not just a thumper in a box. It produces clear thunderous bass. The tweeters also provide suficient mid-range to back up that heavy bass. Listening to rock and such is really awesome with this system. In the high-range, things are also steady. However, the tweeters are a bit muddy when compared to my old AL 221 system (which I turned in because the sub was awful!) Still, this system more than gets the job done. I reccommend this system to anyone with a tight budget.If you've got some extra $ though, buy an AL 621, or the Logitech Z-560."
3,Somewhat dissappointed,"These are great speakers for the money. Great bass and overall performance is acceptable. However I was greatly dissappointed that there was no headphone jack, especially when they are advertised as having one.Hey Logitech...thats false advertising and you should be sued. Well its off to the parts store to buy some bulky adapters to make these work with my headset."
3,"Well, I guess it all depends on how you look at it...","I recently purchased this Logitech Z540 5-Piece Computer Speaker set for my PC, and I must say I'm very impartial towards them. Figuring that this package could provide crisp and clean surround sound was a wrong assumption. I found that the sound came out very hollow, and the farther away I got from them the more the quality went down, until it just sounded plain out flat. My 3 piece Altec Lansing that came standard with my PC turned out to have better sound quality after all, so I promptly hooked them back up.However, if you are upgrading from a low end speaker system, and don't feel like breaking the hundred dollar mark, then these Logitech's are the way to go. But, if you prefer quality, and have the money to spend, don't keep Logitech's Z540 5-Piece speakers in mind, you're better off spending more on Aletc Lansings."
2,Insipid,"I enjoyed 3 of McInerney's earlier novels, but stopped reading this at p.130, despite its occasional wit. So I post this as a warning."
2,So what - crafted for tourists,911 couldn't even shock the main characters our of their superficiality and into three dimensions.It depends on what you want out of a book. Insubstantial hip? Shallow characters that never learn a thing about themselves from beginning to end? Name dropping?I gave it two stars - perhaps too harsh - some of the prose is well crafted. At my age I get a little perturbed when I find that I wasted my time reading something that took me down a road designed for trendy tourists.
1,"Bad book, good reviewer",The reviewer did a great a great job bringing out the best in this book. Although it is a boring book the reviewer did a great job.
2,Good Life not great,"McInerny has a good concept -- how 9/11 might impact the lives of New Yorkers on a personal level -- but he does not execute it well. The characters are not very dimensional, only somewhat compelling/likeable, and particularly after the affair begins any originality is pulled from the story and it reads like a cliche romance novel."
2,I loved it until the last fifty pages......then I was disappointed,"The book worked for 90% of the way...recounting the usual New York social scene that has become McInerney's calling card. However, the last fifty pages were disjointed, seemed as if they were unedited, and ultimately, the ending was not only disappointing, it didn't seem to fit with the way the two leading characters had been portrayed earlier. This is actually one book I wish I hadn't finished....I would have liked it more."
1,A Huge Letdown,The reader feels that the author intended this to be a screenplay for a made-for-tv movie. It's too boring to be a major motion picture.
1,You'd have thought they'd learned,"Specifically, you'd have thought that Russell and Corrine Calloway would've learned from what happened to them in the aftermath of the Stock Market Crash of 1987 (chronicled in ""Brightness Falls"").Nah...they're still the shallow, selfish, self-absorbed people they were 14 years before.The trouble is, you can't really tell whether McInerney thinks that's a good thing or a bad thing."
1,Way overrated,"Glad that I only borrowed this from the library -- truly overrated, nothing special about the writing, and using 9/11 as a device for shallow people to ""find themselves"" needs a far better writer than this in order to work gracefully. Most of it is almost unreadable, except for the short part with some detail right after 9/11. Truly a disappointment, and not recommended for any type of reader."
1,overrated writer,"I just read this book and I can't believe McInerney is ever mentioned in the same breath as Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Cheever, etc. He's not that great of a writer. When I am reading a truly talented writer, like say Kazuo Ishiguro, I know it. I can't exactly put my finger on it but I know I am reading someone who is masterful, and even if I don't especially love the book I am still aware of the excellence of the writing. McInerney doesn't give me that feeling. He is just not that good."
2,No Bright Lights Big City,I lived through 911. So did many others. This book realy was not intersting enough to care about such a trajedy. There wers so many better stories to tell. It reads like Jay's personal journal. I would say that compared to Brett Easton Ellis latest book Jay has been left behind. Sorry
1,Overrated.,"I'm probably in the minority on this, but my feeling is that the author is unduly impressed by the wealthy empty-headed twits that he writes about."
1,A Waste,We read this book for my book club and all of us UNANIMOUSLY agreed it was horrible. Completely predictable and utterly boring.
3,The Novelist Falls,Do brothers Matthew and Luke really have a mother who Cheatham'ed' on their father and attempt to drag out a well done earlier story with a charity bash that we believe? Not in those ashes please.
2,Very disapointed,"This bike is very sturdy, but very heavy. If you are 5'8 like me, you'll be too short for the bike. It's made for a 6' person. If you like speed and light weight, this bike is not for you. It's slow and clunky."
5,Very Good Bike,"First opening it out of the box the bike was very good looking easy assembly but definately needed a tune up...I took it too a local dealer that ive worked with for years and a person in the store commented and asked ""if the lamborghini was one of those 300 mile an hour bikes??"" and i said ""of course if you can find someone to pedal it that fast"" everyone that came in the store that day commented on how well it looked and wanted to know how much i had paid when i told them, their expressions were priceless....very good as far as riding goes i recieved the bike on a friday rode it 40 miles on saturday and sunday and experienced no problems very easy shifting and very comfortable would recommend this bike to any novice cycler, just make SURE TO HAVE IT TUNED UP at a local dealer and it should be a good investment"
4,priced right,This road bike is a best-buy based on price/relative quality. The bike is shipped 95% assembled. The remaining 5% is easy as long as you have a set a metric allen wrenches. My sole complaint with regard to assembly is that the reflector brackets do not fit the bike. The ride is good although I have experienced some slippage/clicking in one particular gear but I beleive I can correct that with some adjustments. Overall a good product so far.
4,Nice beginners bike,"I bought this bike to try road biking as some friends were into it already. I went for this cheap bike as it was affordable and I thought it would not hurt as much to see it in my garage all dusty after 2 months... It turned out that I ended loving riding long distances and became a regular rider. I have put close to 1100 miles on this bike already and it is still going. Yes, I have had to maintain it and yes I eventually did change brakes and shifters as the ones it came with were not designed to ride 40 to 100 miles per week and broke after 10 months or so. I recently upgraded to a carbon bike but I am planning to keep it for training and short rides. My advice, buy it if you want to save money for an entry level bike but still have a sturdy, reliable bike."
3,Pretty Good Starter Bike,"It was easy to put together and only needed minimal adjustment. I think it took about 30 - 40 minutes tops. I switched from a mountain bike so I was familiar with riding. I like the lightness and the gearing. The brakes are mounted a little awkwardly. I am thinking about changing that so i can brake from a seated upright position. Otherwise, a great bike for the price."
1,DON'T BUY MR. COFFEE,"We had purchased a Mr.Coffee Thermal coffee maker and about 1 month later found that it stopped brewing after 2 cups even though I made a full pot.I thought that maybe it was just this maker that was defective so I purchased another of the same. Here's what I found after about 6 months: It doesn't brew the entire pot, Water overflows on counter though I don't know why. Coffee is warm at best after it's finished brewing. Some of the grounds are still dry after brewing. Can't explain that one. All I can say is if you buy this, you may as well be flushing your money down the toilet! Giving it a 1 star is more then it deserves"
1,don't waste your money,"I bought this coffee maker about 2 weeks ago and threw it away this morning (a complete waste of money). The ""brew timer/ clock"" stopped working within a few days of plugging it in, the carafe does not keep your coffee warm beyond 20-30 minutes, and, most importantly, it doesn't make a very good cup of coffee."
1,It is headed for the garbage can,I just filled my second cup of the morning and it is cold. That was the last straw.Coffee drips down the side of the carafe. Coffee grounds and water overflow and make a nice mess on the counter.Carafe does not indicate the amount of water so you dont know how much you are filling until its already in the maker. Guess I could turn the maker upside down to remove the extra water.
4,Cumpre com as expectativas.,"Material excelente, que exige certos cuidados, como todo material de ferro, para no enferrujar. Quanto à utilidade, há que se ser meio criativo, pois o que ela produz no faz parte, nem de longe, da cultura brasileira. Serve apenas para quem quer se embrenhar no mundo da pesquisa culinária."
2,Wedged Corn Bread Pan,My review for this is the same as for the straight sided muffin pan. The pan is shallow and my bread stuck to it.
1,Corn Bread Pan,Don't waste your money. This pan sucks. The corn bread gets stuck and comes out in pieces. I didn't even eat the corn bread. I threw the pan with the corn bread in it in the trash. A Waste of time
5,Lodge Logic Pre-Seasoned Cornbread Wedge Pan,I bought 2 of these pans and I have used one for Scones and they came out perfect. They browned on all sides and the pan cleaned up in just minutes. Excellent Pan.
5,Lodge Logic Pre-seasoned Cornbread Wedge Pan,I have been totally satisfied with this pan. It is easy to clean with just water and soft bristle brush or rag. It allows the cornbread to be flipped out without a mess simply flipping and shaking it briskly. Now my cornbread is better than ever ! I simply spray it with a light baking spray before use. Thanks Lodge Logic for a very useful pan.
5,Fast Service,Just what I wanted for my mom.Thanks for having it available for Christmas..Didn't have to wait long..Thanks for allowing me to get it fast for Christmas..Awesome as always with this company
2,Nice concept but...,Very difficult to clean even when well seasoned and pre-treated.I'm back to my old traditional cast iron skillet.
4,Love it!,"This pan is great for baking scones.....comes out perfect everytime. the only work is having to grease the pan after every use, to maintain the non-stick property. Highly recommended."
4,my son-in-laws- loved this,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 2 son in laws. They loved it, when they figured out what it was. I give a 4 star only because they haven't used it yet!!!!"
4,Great for Cornbread,We love these pans. We like to make cornbread alot and these are the perfect size! I brought two of them and use them at least once a week. They are pre-seasoned and I just sray them with Pam and they are ready to go. They are a little hard to clean in that you have to saok and them scrub the corners to get the cornbread out but not really that hard.
1,Rip off,"I paid $10 for this after searching for the audio of ""10 Lessons to Transform Your Marriage"" by John Gottman. All it is a one sentence description on 5 different books, one including the audio book I was searching for. DO NOT ORDER THIS... IT IS A RIPOFF!!"
3,Was Expecting Better:(,"Don't get me wrong, there are some great tracks here, the album is just a little too ""Ragga"" for me. There's some great breaks stuff, but you have to sit through a bunch of chill, D&B & ragga flavored stuff to get there. Something else that'll either be a turn on or off for alot of people is that the album isn't premixed. If you like Aquasky, or just breaks in general check out their first album ""Beat The System"" available through Amazon.uk, it's a much better album plus it's 2 disc's. Like I said this isn't a bad album, just not spectacular like I'd hoped. Also check out Santos's new album ""Home Sweet Home"", now there's a bangin' new breaks album."
3,Aquasky - Teamplayers,"In the ever-shifting electronic music scene, it seems (as of 2011) that dubstep has supplanted old-fashioned drum n bass. But Aquasky's TEAMPLAYERS shows the vibrance and energy that d'n'b will always possess. From the diva-heavy ""Good Sound"" to the 4/4 thump of ""Overneath,"" Aquasky shows off a diversity of sound that derives, possibly, from the collaborations listed herein. ""Girls and Boys"" gets a little more gender diversity in there, while they have plenty of MCs to tickle your ragga fancy. There's not much to criticize about the album, and for and old-school jump-up album, it's pretty good. It doesn't push the genre ahead any, but it's comfortable enough being what it is."
5,Great medical record book - thorough!,"This book is great - I am a first time mom and want to be organized about keeping my child's medical information. This book has sections for everything from the child's birth information to questions that you want to ask at doctor's visits and immunization records. It is just the right size, easy to put in your diaper bag when making a trip to the doctor's office. There is no frou frou stuff, which I read in someone else's review, which led to my purchase. I am very satisfied with the book."
4,Excellent book - a couple of years out of date.,"It is an excellent book to understand the major differences between Unix and Windows NT. As far as porting code from Unix to Windows NT is concerned it is out of date because it does not cover the latest (versions of) emulation environments such as Cygwin, NuTCRACKER, Interix, and U/Win. In fact two of these environments did not even exist (?) at the time this book was written (Windows NT 4.0 was just released). The author does a good job of providing useful details and is definitely enjoyable to read. If he adds a few chapters covering the other porting environments with their latest versions(which should not be too hard to do) this book can be brought back to its EXCELLENT state."
2,SO BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,All it does after it opens its eyes is turn its head and closes them again it does not interact with you it just sits there and rolls its head!
5,A convincing story,"The Cure is the heroic tale of two very similiar people from different times. One from a perfect society in the future, a future allowing no emotions or diversity in any way. The other character a jewish boy from Strasbourg, at the time of the Black Death. The Cure is a page turner, expressing both the hate and the love one can feel towards another, while also giving you a lesson of the hardship of the jews in Strasbourg. This book mixes the harsh truth of our past and the grim possibility of our future. I loved it."
3,The cure,"I thought this was a pretty good book but it doesn't grab your attention until the very end. The book shows that Jews have been persecuted throughout time, and how ""Christian"" the Church peoples acted in that time. The moral of the story is that diversity is supposed to bring joy to life but it also brings suffering. I also found the end of the book very sad and depressing, but its important to know about things like that so they don't happen again."
4,Totally not what I expected.,"This was my book club's book. I was a bit leery about how we were going to have a sci-fi medieval history book, but she really pulled it off. Being a history buff, I really felt like I was there and seeing history through the eyes of a young Jewish man. It was very engaging. The ""cure"" was totally unexpected, and we disagreed on what the cure actually was. It might have been better with more detail about the future time, but overall I really liked this book. I found myself thinking about this book for weeks after finishing it."
1,The Cure,"I didn't buy the right book. I was looking for the book of the movie ""The Cure"". It was my fault and it was my first Amazon buy."
3,The Cure,"I thought The Cure was okay. It was confusing sometimes and the way the people talked sounded strange. I didntlike the book overall because Im not into these types of books.the setting was in the future and every thing was controlled and the same. If you werent like every one else you were ""recycled.""the main character was not conforming to society and the people in charge give him the option of a quick painless death or ""the cure."" He picks ""the cure"" and is sent off to a secret location. The secret loction and is were the elders stay and his journey begins."
4,1984-ish,"Carter's work has a tendency to ramble on a bit, but its a good read. The Fortunate Fall has an interesting 1984-ish feel to it while still managing to add a human side to the often hardboiled stereotypes of the cyberpunk genre."
2,"Bulky, Looks funny, Sound not that great","I had ordered these headphones seeing its specifications. However, after hearing them i found them to be ordinary. the size is too big and the head band looks funny... they comfortably fit on your ears though but the sound isn't tht great..."
3,"So So Headphones,","First off, the sound won't blow you away. But for something thats this cheap it's not bad, although I was hoping for much more. They weren't really comfortable but they never irritated me. They looked kinda cool, something spacey, I'm not sure it thats a pro or con however. If you're looking for something better but a little pricier go for the Grado SR60, they sound a whole lot better."
3,HUGE,"if you've read any of the other reviews on this page, you'll know that these things are massive and look redicilous on your head, but the drawbacks end there. The comfort of these things is great, they're very light for their size, the cups fit around your ears, not ON your ears like many headphones, so there is absolutely no pressure put on your ears. Before this pair, i bought a pair of sennheisers, but i had to return them due to the headaches/earaches i got after wearing them for only 20 minutes! The sound quality of these comapred to sennheisers is indistingusiable. Sure i have heard better sounding cans before, but none in this price range."
3,Great headphones but not as durable,"These are a great pair of headphones that cancel out noises pretty good but th pin that holds up the ajustable thingy is hollow so it can break very eaisly,but can be fixed buy a small paper clip"
4,Much larger than I expected,"The Sony MDR-XD300 headphones are exactly how they are described in the over view. The headphones have a pretty good overall sound for the price. These headphones are perfect for the house and they include a very long extension that reaches all the way to my couch (15ft away). They have two different modes (independent) for each ear, media and music. I really couldn't tell a difference between the two. The thing that impressed me the most was the suspension system that makes the headphones virtually weightless on your head. I have worn these for four straight hours playing games and forgot that they were on my head. They have a deep sound but not overpowering to the ears. They are extremely large in size, this is really the only drawback of this product. For the price, get them but if you are looking for a great set of monitors a would recommend the Grado SR60's for twice the price."
3,Pretty good,Good sound! Not quite as good as my previous Aiwa model though. Won't buy Aiwa headphones anymore though because I went through two pair that had one side stop working. Hopefully these won't have that problem!
1,agree with m a r s and robin...,"If you expect novels to be well-written, this one is not. The characters are one-dimensional, the story line plods along very predictably. Don't waste your time or money."
3,"Dig a little deeper, Jacq","After reading the book, I was a little disappointed. A great topic, and even an enjoyable read, if you are looking for something light and doesn't require much of the reader. I kept hoping for more detail about the setting, more historical background on the Place of Truth, and more elaborate characters. I will probably read the next book in the series in the near future, but I'm not rushing out to buy it today."
2,Nefer the Silent,"The novel is historical fiction but it is a very simplistic and predictable plot. the reader does glean quite a lot of information about the government, customs and politics of the Egyptians. The ending is awful, never solving the basic mystery that continued through the whole story!It is on a 5-6 grade level of reading but the subject matter is much more adult than that."
5,even more confusing...,"... is the fact that ""The Bluebird Recordings 1938"" has 18 tracks listed, online and on the tray. But there's 21 tracks!"
4,So cute for Christmas,Loved decorating with this on trees for Christmas cookies and cupcakes!! It was fun for everyone and added that extra touch to the tree leaves. Can't wait to use it on Halloween cookies!
3,Not as pictured,I love the porcelain case but don't feel the clock was adequately represented when I ordered it. The pictured item shows a second hand on the face of the clock--there is none. The review states that it has black detailing--it is in gold.
1,Absolute awful and a waste of money,"Whipsmart and Exile this CD is not. Could this be Liz developing herself? No, it is a clear example of ""she has a record contract and her last 2 CDs did well so lets just put this poorly written and unlistenable trash out so that the idiots on the Liz-Phair-team will buy it."" Don't waste your money. Liz is creatively ""dead."" This is the last you'll ever hear from her (it's been a couple years). Buy her sometimes fun, rocking and clueless first two CDs"
2,What happened? This is not the Liz that I know!,"I bought this CD - and I did hear that she was not as raunchy on it - but she does not sound like that Liz that I LOVE on ""Exile in Guyville!""I rarely listen to this album at all. I like ""Whitechocolatespaceegg"" and ""Baby Got Going"" - and that's it. I miss that old Liz and I WANT HER BACK!!!Rating: C"
4,An Indie Goddess Grows Up,"From her humble beginnings in the critcally lauded Exile in Guyville, Liz Phair has grown into a musical force. After marrying and having a child, Ms. Phair has fine tuned her musical abilities (her voice and guitar skills have grown tremendously). This is her most musically diverse effort to date. It fits in perfectly with the ladies of Lilith Fair (maybe it should have been Lilith Phair)- a definitively female record which showcases the full potential of its writer."
4,Years best,"Liz is the best singer out there. Her voice is about what we all have and she uses it to a wonderful and enticing effect. You want to learn how to write songs, grab a Liz Phair album. I look forward to following her journal-like recording career."
4,"not liz's best, but pretty damn good","Liz Phair's latest is about what we've come to expect from this very talented Chicago native. Some reviews have said that this record is a departure from her 2 previous releases. I would have to say that this is not so. If you liked Exile In Guyville, you will almost certainly like this record. Yes, the songs are little less raunchy, but it is another well-crafted album from one of the greatest female artists around these days."
5,This one should make her a star,"I was a casual Liz fan until I bought this CD last weekend. I cannot stop playing it, plain and simple. If this album doesn't make her a huge star, there is no justice."
4,"Not like Exile in Guyville, but a nice change!","I was quite skeptical of this album after having worshiped Exile in Guyville. Liz is prepared to ""market"" this album better than the others. The lyrics are less vulgar and more on the track of mainstream singers. While I believe she has ""sold out"" to her true fans in this regard, She has made some new ones with her improved singing abilities. Liz's voice is truly, marvelous in this album. She's has found new notes and a smoothness in her singing. I've listened to this album numerous times, and each time I grow fonder of it. A few favorites: ""Sh*tload of Money"", ""Perfect World"", and ""Ride"". Way to go, Liz!!!"
4,The third time's a charm.,"I recently listened to this CD the third time through. While I rushed out and bought it the day it was released, listening to it twice, I was disappointed by the overproduced quality of it (what the heck are you doing on a Liz CD anyway, REM? Scott Litt? Oberlin's a long way from Athens, guys.) Then let it sit for awhile. Went back to it tonight. These songs actually do rock and Liz did make a few steps forward -- this one's up there with the best albums of the last 3 years. ""Headache"" is alone worth the price. Hey mister...I will never be your girl...This one grows on you and, after all, that's the true measure of an artist's work. Enjoy."
2,The second album slump...on the third album,"I don't know what it was - domestic bliss, creative well run dry? - but this is where all but the true believers are going to get off. Exile was genius in both concept and execution, Whip-Smart an underapreciated collection of damn-fine (and damn-intelligent) songs. This almost seems like a parody of those records, with few hummable tunes to boot. Hey, look, if you've heard either of the first two I know you're going to have to hear this no matter what. Just don't blame me that you didn't borrow it from a friend before shelling out the sheckles. ("
4,Exploring a new sound...,"...and doing a damn fine job of it. ""Whitechocolatespaceegg"" is NOT ""Guyville"", and no one said it was. Each is a great album, but not in the same way. This album features gem after gem, and I heartily recommend it both to those who loved ""Exile in Guyville"" and those who have never heard it."
5,A lyrical masterpiece,"I picked up this album on a whim and I can't believe how great it is. The music is catchy in a naive way (and all the more engaging for the lack of polish) but the lyrics are some of the best I've come across. Their content ranges from semi-obsecure to in your face but it is always insightful. More imporatantly the lyrics are poetic. The words flow with an effortless lyricism that makes me smile. It is like listening to Bob Dylan, first the sound of one word following the other hits you and then the meaning does. The combination is a knockout. A great album."
4,enough about selling out,"Although I have not heard Exile, I have just recently picked up this CD and Whip-Smart, both of which are excellent. However, I am highly annoyed when I read these reviews accusing Phair of selling out by using a more commercial sound. Musicians are free to evolve just like everyone else is. It seems when they change, and fans of the old don't like the new, they throw the ""sell out"" claim at the artist. Enough. 34 years ago many cursed Dylan as a sell out when he turned electric. Now, 34 years later they all look like idiots."
1,Confirmation of a Rock Poseur,"Yeah, 'Exile In Guyville' was a nice debut -- the right album at the right time. But her follow up 'Whip Smart' failed to convince me that she was going or growing anywhere. 'Whitechocolatespaceegg' reaffirmed my suspicions that Liz Phair is, at best, a mediocre pop artist. Whatever elements of her anger and angst that might be hinted at in her lyrics seem ersatz. She lacks the energy to be a rocker, the musicianship to be virtuoso, and the conviction to be an icon. There are probably a lot of might-have-been Liz Phairs writing advertising jingles out on Madison Avenue right now. And some of those jingles have got more soul than any cut on this album."
3,it's o.k,"this Liz Phair CD was ok. some catchy toons. but i don't see the big hype on it, the quality of the music isnt the greatest, and not all the songz were that catchy. when i first got this CD i liked it. i listened to it a few times, haven't touched it since.when the new album came out (Liz Phair) my bro offered to buy it for me, and i was hesitant, but i really like it, and now i have more respect for ms. phair. so ya, if u didn't like this album, try out the new one.if ur tired of the new one and want more, i'd check out this one."
2,hasnt' lost her edge?,"Overall a very poor effort with a handful of great songs. The Spin review above said it all perfectly. It's impossible to understand the creative or production process but with the few truly great songs on this disc, it seems that she hasn't lost her edge to the degree that this album suggests. Essentially listening to this CD requires either a remote or a program function on your machine."
2,Couple of good tracks,"You know after reading all these 4 and 5 star reviews I have to contest them. I was eagerly awaiting this album and felt like I was really let down. Some of the tracks seem very forced in response to her critics and meteoric rise, some grate wheras previous albums didn't have that effect on me. Couple of good tracks on the album don't save it but warrant a couple of stars. Avoid this album, let's hope her next effort gets her back on track."
3,Golden Egg,"I'm going to upset Lizphiles and say that whitechocolatespaceegg is far better than her much revered classic Exile in Guyville. Not that Guyville didn't have its strong points, but Egg showcases a maturity and pop sheen that Guyville lacked. Egg, to boot, is still chockful of Liz Phair's insightful lyrics, sharp observations and characterizations. It's the sharper production values on Egg that give Phair's songs the glow and punch they deserve. Beautiful lines like ""Love is nothing like they say/you gotta pick up the little pieces every day"" should be accompanied by arrangements worthy of lyrics with such poetic simplicity. Whether you've been a Liz phan from the get-go, or you just heard of her, Egg is a moving piece of work."
2,One two listenable songs.,"Nothing is like Liz's earlier efforts. Tracks one and seven are OKAY - but that's it. ""Exile in Guyville"" and ""Whip-Smart"" blow this out of the water. Liz fans from previous albums should avoid this one. It's pretty close to terrible.rating: D"
3,Inconsistent work from a talented musician,"I own both of Liz's earlier works, and think they are both amazing! I couldn't wait until this cd released a few years back, and then I listened to it. What was at first completely dissapointing, became mostly dissapointing after many forced listenings. I couldn't believe the Liz could let me down so I force myself to listen to this repeatedly and eventually there were a few tracks that I grew to like, such as 'Fantasize' and 'Perfect World'. Overall this cd isn't bad, but it lacks the edge and wit found on her previous albums."
4,Life after the thrill is gone...,"Unfortunately for Liz, she hit a grand slam home run on her first swing (""Exile in Guyville""), leaving little possibility of anything but artistic retreat and the inevitable evolution into slick professionalism in her future.To her credit, she's made two far from bad albums after that classic debut, and may well continue to put out strong work that stays on the right side of obvious commercialism. But she'll never be able to surprise us again, which is a shame.That said, this album contains many strong songs, especially ""Johnny Feelgood,"" ""Polyester Bride,"" and ""What Makes You Happy."" And she can still be charmingly off-beat, as on ""Uncle Alvarez"" and ""Shitloads of Money."" She could easily be doing Sheryl Crow-slick mainstream rock, but her quirky indie instincts are intact. While not as interesting as Pavement, she's maturing with dignity in a similar way, and she deserves credit for that."
3,WhiteChocolateSpaceEgg,"WCSE, is described as Liz's mother album because it was written when she had her child. The album title came from a dream she had once, which is why it is so strange, however, the song itself is great. Liz managed to show her ability to share feelings in her songs with this record. The only problem is the songs aren't very memorable. The song ""Polyester Bride"" is a hit from the minute you hear it. There are other songs that shine on this album, but for the most part Liz was trying something new and it worked, but it didn't.Overall it is a good and great album, but it just does not have the spark like the first two albums. But everyone should give it a listen."
3,It's hard to repeat,"Exile in Guyville was/is a special album. Raw and personal, a strong dose of urgency mixed with excellent guitar work. Most reviews of Exile focus on the sex, but it's the Stones-like guitar riffs that work for me. I'd hoped to see progress in her craftsmanship, but was disappointed by this effort. Where the first CD's ""garage"" sound conveyed authenticity, this CD sounds more ordinary."
5,Combine Hole and Natalie Merchant and you get Liz Phair,"My favorite record of 1998. Phair combines biting lyrics, soaring melodies, and catchy riffs into the best pop record of 1998. Certainly more commercially leaning than her previous records, but no less brilliant. Best songs are Big Tall Man, Johnny Feelgood, Polyesther Bride, and Uncle Alvarez. I also saw LP in concert in Chicago and she was fantastic."
5,"oh please,come over for spaghetti","does a person have to live with this agony, loving something and just wanting to slurp it down.. Forget table manners, just let this cd drool down your chin. let it stain your white tshirt, then wear it to church and say see, see, god loves me just the way i am.."
5,An overlooked masterpeice,"Although whitechocolatespacegg was Liz Phair's worst selling album, it's not horrible. Granted, it takes a little getting used to. I got it expecting it to be a little like her newest album, her self-titled. I didn't like it the first time through. It's more laid back and didn't have the pop-vibes from her newest album. But when I stopped comparing this album with her other one, I realized it's actually really good! It really does have a little bit of Pop, like the song ""Polyester Bride"" which is one of my favorites on the album. This album really started to grow on me, and I realized it really is a masterpeice, which got sadly overlooked.Favorite songs: Whitechocolatespaceegg, Polyester Bride, Headache, Girls' Room"
3,"Not even close to ""Exile""","I think one of Liz's downfalls is the fact her first album was one of the best albums ever made. How can you compare after ""Exile in Guyville?"" Whitechocolatespaceegg is good, don't get me wrong, but I miss her emotional honesty she used to have. The songs on this album don't really seem to explore the more trivial issues of life. She seems to just sing about whatever is there. What exactly is the point of ""Uncle Alvarez""? And I hate how now her songs are more ""studio-ish."" What happened to just Liz, and her guitar? If you're a person interested in Liz's music, buy Exile in Guyville first."
1,"Cd great........ book, not great","My husband is an AVID Dennis DeYoung fan. When this book came out he wanted it since Dennis includes a new song with purchase of the book. The book is I'd say good for the 18-25 group....anyone older would look at it and think ""expensive Harlequin romance novel"". Her sex ""scenes"" are pretty explicit... which in my opinion does not fit the rest of the ""Rated G"" book. Bottom line if I could have purchased the cd minus the book I would have."
2,It's just not Big Mountain,"Having the reputation of being one of Southern California's Premiere Reggae Bands I was really disappointed with One Love. None of the tracks are Reggae they are just classic pop love songs made to a real mellow rythym and in some instances rather bland. This album was never released in the US and now I understand why. Having said that, if you are a true Big Mountain fan the album is a good collectable, packaged nicely and still has the crooning sounds of Quino the Bands founding member."
2,Not enough instruction and too much theatrics,"This instructional video actually teaches guitar through story. The story involves a teenager who dreams of being a great guitarist but can't even tune his guitar. Out of no where, a guy named H.E.L.P. appears in his bedroom and attempts to motivate and teach the boy to play guitar. Instruction covers how to hold a guitar and pick, play a few notes, a few chords, and rests. The kid learns to play a simple rendition of ""Ode to Joy"". That's about it for the story. The supplemental material is actually decent, the highlight of which is covering how to read basic sheet music.What I look for in this type of DVD is instruction where I can hear the notes and see how they are played. This DVD instead shows you a few chords and notes and gives the rest of the lessons in text form. If that's all you want, you are better off buying a book."
4,good blade,"For the price its not a bad blade. I purchased 2 blades already, and though I didnt count every cut, I probably made a few hundred cuts with each blade. I'd say it was an average cut of 8 linear inches through pavers that are 2+3/8 inches thick. I've used other blades that were more expensive, and didn't last as long, and i've used cheaper blades that weren't even close. About the only negative i've found is that the kerf is little wide, and the finished cut is not as perfect as the more expensive blades, the same ones that didn't last as long as these. So for paver work these are perfect, but I wouldn't use it for natural stones or ceramics."
4,Double-check clock size before you buy,"Although this clock was advertised on Amazon's site as ""7.5 x 5.2 inches"" in size, the two clocks I received were only 3.5 x 3.5 inches; suitable as bedside clocks, but too small for office, den or living room display."
5,Drive your friends nuts.,"Had I not taken a binary math course in college I wouldn't have know what a binary clock was the first time I saw one. This unit is a nice size for a desk clock. It has four modes, regular or miliraty time, and you can select either vertical or horizontal operation. You cange either with the press of a button. Put two side by side, never in the same mode, and change the modes each day. Just tell people it's a clock. When they ask the obvious question, just tell them it's easy to figure out. Just don't tell them how."
3,"Enjoyable, but Minor","CAPE FEAR is an entertaining novel written by John MacDonald in 1957. It's essentially a story about a civilized man whose family is being threatened by a murderous psychopath. The central theme of the book is how far the man will go to protect himself and the ones he loves.MacDonald is certainly a highly skilled and intelligent writer, but CAPE FEAR left me somewhat cold. It's not very suspenseful or gripping, and I didn't feel the characters (especially the main character's children) were very well developed. A lot of the dialogue is pretty stilted. It's an interesting book on a thematic level, but I wasn't very engaged by it.In short, CAPE FEAR is an enjoyable way to spend a few hours, but I wouldn't recommend it to a modern reader looking for fast-paced thrills."
3,Best Bad Guy,I can tell that this has influenced modern writers of thriller fiction. There wasn't anything amazing about MacDonald's writing but you are able to overlook that because of his story telling. The story was really interesting and the way he went about telling it made it that much better. Max Cady is definitely the villain but there was always a little doubt put there because he really isn't in the book that much in person. He is manly in dialog between other people. This bit of mysteriousness makes him an even better villain for some reason. The dialog between Cady and Sam was some of my favorite parts. The books ending really disappointed me but I liked it more than the movies for sure. This is something to read just because it has one of the best villains in a thriller I've read so far.
4,cape fear--the executioneers,John MacDonald 7/24/1916 to 12/28/1986.A rapist named Max Cady is put in prisonby Sam Bowden.

1,Shocking snorefest,"After seeing both great movies this was based on, I was shocked at how dull the writing is. Interesting on a thematic level (as one reviewer was generous enough to put it), but otherwise this is strictly by-the-numbers. Absolutely NOTHING happens until the last 20 pages and even then the action is scant. Maybe this was hot stuff back in the day, but I found it one of the most overblown books I had ever read and not enjoyable at all. It reads like the type of pulp crap that many writers churned out back then for a quick buck, but others like Thompson, Willeford and Westlake did better (I think). Beware...you have been warned!"
5,The Best Wu Solo No Doubt!,"One can even say that this is better than Wu's 36 Chambers, but to appreciate and understand this album more you would first have to appreciate and understand 36 Chambers. This album is an absolute classic! 36 Chambers was the blueprint, Cuban Linx was the finished product. What makes this album a great album is that it's very catchy, open, and lively. Raekwon and Ghostface are great together. You can tell Raekwon put his heart into this album. The beats are very sample-filled and mesmorizing nothing out of the ordinary but with the Rza touch of course, not to say that anything the Wu makes is ordinary. Get this album because there's not too many like them these days."
5,The Most Incredible........,"This CD is SO tight, I get nosebleeds everytime I listen to it.The tracks are so juicy, I'd listen to it on a walkman while IN THE SHOWER.Raw, Meth, Ghost and the whole cast are all here...Best Cop the albulm if you wanna talk NY style.Nuf respect to the projects.I'm Ghost.One Love.Martin."
5,Killa Hitz,"This album is true O.G.I would also recommend Genius/GZA's""Liquid Swords"".This is the album for true Hip-Hop/Wu-tang fans."
5,Another gem by the wu.,"Another classic album by the legendary Wu-tang clan. Rza once again, absolutely killed the boards on production on this one. Some of the beats just put you in a trance and then your necks broke from bobbin'. Rae and Ghost's styles blend perfectly with one another to make yet another cd I can put in and not touch a button except the volume. I'd advise anybody reading to also check out Liquid Swords, Return of the 36, and obviously Enter the 36. Cuban Linx is a beautiful album though, every song is a gem."
5,Classic crime rap from THE golden age of hiphop music,"But beware...No picture cover! Amazon at least could have told. I mean, it's kinda misleading.Otherwise, It's not gonna get much realler than Chef Raekwon rappin' about "" gettin lifted in the staircase"". After all these years still holding his ground!"
5,"my first ""wu""","I started my ""wu expeditions"" with the chef and ghost on this cd,and I'm glad I did!If you've never heard ""ice cream man""you are depriving yourself and other party-goers of a genuinly perfect rap cut!yeah,it's from '95,but it's a helluva lot better(superior)than any thing out there these days(i.e.kayne west,lil jon,lil flip,ect,ect,ect)it's so damb good,it seriously doesn't even sound dated(old)."
5,Best non-commercial hip-hop album ever made,"This is the only rap/hip-hop c.d. I have ever heard where I can not find a track I hate. Every song is amazing. 2 through 6 are some of the best Wu-Tang songs on any album. Knuckleheadz, Incarcerated Scarfaces, Glaciers of Ice, and Guillotine are the best on the album. The only fault I can find on this album is that there are long intros before every song. If you like anything made by Wu-Tang, The Roots, Nas, Jurassic-5, or Biggie Smalls you will love. Its as good as Illmatic, Ready to Die, and All Eyes on Me. BUY THIS!!"
5,very good,"This is the best wu album out thereThe best songs are:incarcerated scarfaces,rainy dayz,ice waterglaciers of ice,ice cream and the very best song is verbal intercours,that's a classic song"
4,"Good, but waaaaaaaaay overrated","This was not a bad CD by any means, however, by all the hype saying this is the best wu tang solo disc ever, I was expecting much more. The first half of the album definetly sounds like a 5 star CD, however the second half is not. The best tracks on this cd are ""Knuckleheadz"", ""Criminology"", ""Incarcerated Scaarfaces"", and ""Guillotine (swordz)"" (especially Inspectah Deck's verse). Those are really the only tracks that stood out to me. There are no bad tracks on this cd, there just aren't enough great ones for a 5 star rating. This is definetly not the best wu tang solo release, but if you already have ""Ironman"" by Ghostface Killah, ""Tical"" by Method Man, and ""liquid Swords"" by the GZA/Genius, and you want another good wu tang cd, then pick this up because it is better then any of the recent stuff they have put out. All in all a solid release by Raekwon."
2,Average at best.,"This album was supposedly a classic, but I found out it was overhyped, this album has the most talking I have ever heard in my life. ""yeah Son"" ""Word is born"" thats all you here on every track which becomes really annoying. I was expecting to hear nothing but Raekwon but all I got was an above average MC with an average sidekick on every track (Ghost Face) It was supposed to be Raekwon's ""Built for Cuban Linx"", not Ghost Face Killa featuring Raekwon. On almost every track they start talking about stupid things that make no sense. This album ruins classic hits like ""incarcerated scarfaces"" and ""ice cream"" there are some nice hits but mostly everything is wack. Raekwon needs to learn from GZA on how to make a ""SOLO"" album. Not recommnded unless you like a lot of talking and ghost face killa, go ask your friend if he/she has it and burn the good songs from them, and leave this album at the store."
2,"Awful beats, Wu-tangs worst ever!","I don't know why so many people are fans of this album , i bought a used copy really cheap and have enjoyed many verses from Raekwon on Wu-Tang joints and others howevever I felt hugeley dissapointed when I heard it...The beats all sound the same, and I would hardly call them beats... RZA does the worst work he has ever done.I would advice u to listen to this album before u buy it, couse even if you're a Wu-Tanger the chances are u will not like this one..."
1,"STRAIGHT GARBAGE, OVERRATED","This album is overrated, BAD BEATS, I MEAN BAD, I can make better beats with a stick and a rock. Nas sucks"
5,Wu-Gambino 101,"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... has to be one of the, if not, the best Wu-Solo CD. With sharp lyrics from ""Raekwon"", as well as the rest of Wu-Tang Clan featured in the album, especially ""Ghostface"" to the razor sharp production from the ""RZA"". It's a must to own, whether your a Wu-Head or not. Simply marvelous!!!"
5,"BUY THIS CD, BUY THIS CD, BUY THIS CD...","Every once in a while there is a CD that shows why music was invented. It reminds of the epic potential that a classic album can have. This is that album. The best from the Wu-Tang Clan, Raekwon, shows us classic wordplay backed RZA's atomspheric beats. The CD is a movie (it even uses pieces of John Woo's 'The Killer') making you feel every lyric every rhyme. This is a classic that can only be compared to by BDP's 'Criminal Minded,' Public Enemy's 'Nation of Millions...' and Nas' 'Illmatic.' One of the best ever."
5,sick rappin',"Dopest Wutang album ive heard. If youre a fan of their music and have not gotten this yet, you must. It's the best of all albums. Sick flows, wicked beats, hynotizing music. peep this fo sho!!!"
5,One of the best debut CDs ever,"Raekwon has everything, the beats, the lyrics.This is one of the best debut CDs ever. Not only did we get Rae but we got a taste of Ghostface too."
5,All piano songs,Probably Giovanni Allevi is unknown in USA but in Italy his success is growing very fast. I think that his music is beautiful. He plays and composes songs for piano. If you have the chance to listen his music you will love it.
5,The French Song,Can anyone help me identify the album from which the Sandpipers sung The French Song? That's the album I like to see on CD.Karlt3@excite.com
4,mellow,"brings back memories of my youth.very good recording,simple but meaningful lyrics.hard to find recordings by the sandpipers.glad to find this available."
4,The whole album never fails to please my senses,"The album is a collection of love songs that still please my senses when I listen. I owned a record (33 format) a long time ago, and just hit me to search for it. I am glad I found it again."
1,Get a different one,"This is probably the most confusing book on a specific software program that has ever been written. The Macromedia manual is actually less bulky, and far more informative than this book which is just an expansion of the manual."
4,John Lyons is great,This book has a lot of common sense tips for training your horse. I've learned new things that have really helped.
3,A generic training aid,"I felt like this book had a very generic outlook on things. It just didn't go in depth enough to satisfy what I wanted to learn. If you are truly looking to get a better partnership with you and your horse, I recommend Pat Parelli's book: Natural Horsemanship. It just has a more easy to read and more horse savvy format than this book seemed to."
5,The only diet made for real life!,"Forget about fad diets--they are the surefire path to failure. When you lose a lot of weight quickly through unhealthy means, you are guaranteed to gain it all back. The Exercise Exchange Program is a HEALTHY WAY OF LIFE. The food exchanges are created by the American Dietetic Association (did you know that Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig use those very same exchanges?). You won't learn tricks and fads from this book--you will learn correct food portions and easy ways to exercise that you can use FOREVER. I went on this diet and lost 15 pounds in 4 months (a slow and healthy rate of weight loss)--and I kept it off for 3 years! This uncomplicated, flexible diet plan will truly teach you how to make permanent, healthy lifestyle changes."
4,Very pleased!,"My first dryer ordered was not working out of the box. Amazon made the return very simple however and I chose to try another one. This was sent very quickly, easy to install and is working great. Thanks Amazon!"
2,Terrible,The microphone broke after a week. Their tech support is horrible and haven't answered any of my e-mails.I recommend the plantronics dsp-500.
2,Static Sound with Limited Functionality,"My set has static constantly in the background. The microphone sounds nice when I record, but fails to function when I use Teamspeak2, the reason I bought it. I'm using Windows XP and my buttons do little but operate the LED's. If I had read some reviews I would have steered clear. The idea was good but Labtec did not follow through."
2,It only works with Win/Xp,I tried it with Win/2000 and Win/98 and it recorded static or noise. Labtec support does not answer my emails.
3,Surprisingly decent,"I have tried many other headsets and this one faired out to sound the best and made me sound the best. After 4+ hours, your ears tend to get sore, but hell... Get off the computer! Used it for online gaming for a few years until I ran over the wires one too many times where the sound only came out of one side...With today's technology, you can probably get more for your buck than these, but still a good buy!"
5,A true genius,"I grew up in the same town as Bix, and there is a jazz festival there (Davenport, IA) in his honor. Bix was so revolutionary in his approach, and the only musician with which he can be compared is Satchmo. Louis was an avid Bix fan himself (Ain't nobody sound like him yet). If you want to hear a true genius and jazz revolutionary, get as many of Bix's cds as possible. To paraphrase Hoagy Carmichael, the sound of his cornet is like a woman saying ""yes"". Amen!"
5,Absolutely banging,"I have heard comments from several people that chapter three in the ""Happy 2B Hardcore"" series is the weakest...obviously they weren't feeling too well when they said that. Chapter three is happy hardcore at it's finest with the usual top notch mixing by Anabolic Frolic, and just to let you know, I have never been disappointed with any of the ""Happy 2b Hardcore"" albums, every one is great, so if you are looking for one of them to add to you're collection take you're pick, because they all satisfy."
5,HAPPY 2B HARDCORE 3 RULES!!!,"I was introduced to this CD by a very good friend of mine during my freshmen year in college. I was amazed and from that momenent on Happy 2b Hardcore Volume 3 became one of the best CD's in my collection. When I returned home for the summer and I was reunited with my friends from high school, I played it for them and immidiatly they were hooked also! This CD just rules and it puts you in the happiest, most energetic mood ever! I just ordered Happy 2B Hardcore Vol 5 . . . hopefully it is up to par."
5,techno lover justin,"ok, let me just say this. this is the fastest cd in the whole set! this cd gives you a nice, bassfull beat you cant help to dance to! but, also, let me sayt thise: only a techno lover would want to hear this stuff! Rap lovers, dont bye ths cd. it would be to intergetic fo you. anobolic frolic did his best works on this cd! well, that about says it all!"
5,I am AMAZED,"I am AMAZED this has to be the best cd i hav bought it is good to listen to anytime.It just gives u a boost of energy.The vocals are great the mixing is good my favorite tracks are ""Eurolove"" by brisk and trixxy, ""shooting star"" by BANG!. and ""eyeopener. All of the tracks are great but those are my favorite i recommend this cd to anyone. Just go out and buy it u won't be disappointed."
5,Anabolic Frolic...does it every time!,"Man, Im more impressed with Happy 2B Hardcore 3 than I am with one and two. Incorporating some of the best songs from the best happycore dj's such as Brisk, Sy & Demo, and others, he puts together a wonderful compilation. All you happycore fans best get out and buy this album!"
5,best of the trilodgy,THIS MO FO IS THE SWEETEST TECHNO CD OUT THERE SO FAR. BESIDES TRANCEPORT THIS IS NICE. I LOVE THE MOODINESS AND THE FEMALE VOCALS. :)
3,Great tracks but horrible mixing,"The track selection is great! Probably the best out of the previous three chapters. Anabolic Frolic has outdone himself again with Chapter Three. I am a proud supporter and attendee of the Hullabaloo parties in Toronto.But don't kid yourself about the mixing. The mixing is lack-luster at best. This CD might as well just be a compilation. Tracks noticably overlap each other and some times he just cuts to the next track without even attempting to mix it in. If you want to hear good mixing, try Chapter 5. After some work, Anabolic seems to be getting it right."
5,fantastic,If you like the Jam then you will love this! Worth every penny. Truely fantastic intelligent late 70's melodic punk from the UK...I can't belive these guys broke up or that they never made it big. A gem of lost history!
1,Far fetched,"I think while some points can be gleaned from this book, I found it extremely far fetched. I tried to read it because I do like understanding different points of views, however, I couldn't get past the first few chapters. Far fetched."
1,"Unsupported, unadulterated hogwash!","Larry Dossey likes to say that prayer has been scientifically proven, but he just doesn't have a case. He avoids directly defining ""prayer"" or explaining how exactly it would work. Does anyone really believe that God would let someone get sick or die just because no one prayed for him or her? Dossey wants us to believe that a just God is a sort of cosmic favor dispenser, only helping those who pray. The evidence doesn't support what he says. Soft-headed, gullible New Agers will love this book; others beware."
5,Works as advertised,"My middle-aged bod just isn't as shapely as it used be, especially after having two children, and so a little extra lift and control is a good thing. Today, I tried wearing the Flexees Instant Slimmer Firm Control Waistnipper with brief and it worked. Very comfortable and the Waistnipper did shrink my waistline by about two inches. Now I can wear a smaller dress size thanks to the Flexees foundation."
2,Poor execution,"This is a great concept, but was poorly executed. The boning and elastic work great at smoothing out that muffin top and spare tire, but your excess fat is squeezed up to the top of the garment--creating the effect of an extra pair of breasts below the natural ones, as well as giving you back cleavage.The same company makes a similar product that looks like a modern corset (Flexees Women's Instant Slimmer Firm Control Waistnipper #6868). This control garment works much better, except it has a tendency to ride up or down. However, it extends to the underside of the bust, creating a much more pleasing silhouette. Unfortunately it is too short to be worn with low-rise pants, but may be more suited toward wear with a dress or higher pants. When sitting down, however, the boning bends out unattractively.If you have a short torso, the product on this page just may work for you. Maybe. Otherwise look at the other product I mentioned in my review if you plan to be standing all night."
3,returned it same week,"I bought this Flexee's for a new holiday dress, thinking it would add a little help. It's super comfortable, hitting right below bra line.All was well, until I put the dress on over it.With sleek material, all the clasps and wiring showed under the dress.I have to return it, since I don't know anyone who wants to advertise that they are wearing shapewear."
2,Waist CHOKER!,"I ordered an XL, after seeing a review that said to get a smaller size than you would normally. I wear a size 20 jeans (loose fitting), and wanted to try this to get my ""square butt"" hips under control.... I wore it for about 30 minutes, and it was all I could stand. It hurt! It rolled down from the top (in the back) and pinched on the front....If you can stand the pain, it really does squeeze you in :) But for me- it would be less painful to diet and exercise regularly.... :)"
1,AAAhhh,"Ok, so this is good concept but the problem arises when you wear it and when you are big and have fat it does not work because it really is not big enough. What i mean is that it does work on the areas it covers but when it does it squeezes the fat and bulges fat into other areas. although my lower tummy was tucked in but alot of the fat was than squeezed up and bulged out from the upper ab. the thing needs to cover the area under the breast too!"
4,waist nipper,"Thank you for my order, it is exactly what I ordered, but I think I underestimated my own size, but I thank you anyway."
5,Great Timesaver!,"I always search for poems that reinforce the sight words we introduce and this does just that. I type and put it in their homework notebooks to work with for the week. Although I have quite a collection of poems I have used, this has been a nice addition and saves time when looking for support of specific words. I have not used the pages as they are written, to have children write the word in the spaces, but I'm sure others would find it useful. I have purchased way too many teaching resource books that go unused but this one is well worth the price! Great for kindergarten and grade 1!"
4,Good book,"This book was great for teaching my students sight words, reading, and writing. I used it almost daily for about a week until another teacher asked to borrow it. That was about a month ago and I haven't seen it since. I guess she likes it too!"
2,sight words,I feel like it is a little too easy for my students. It is definately for young students. My students seem to get a little board with the repitition of the same word. It just wasn't what I expected.
4,The Cockrel,"This book is a successful continuation in the Lewrie Series. It stands alone well but the character, as developed in the earlier books,gives insight to the reader of why Lambdin thinks and acts as he does. I enjoyed more because of the prvious books"
3,Like a rolling ride on a choppy sea,"I agree with the reviewer from Portland, OR. The fractured French/English was totally annoying and the map was very poorly printed, but ...the story seemed like a serial drama, some parts were extremely well-written and exciting. Others were slow and plodding. It was good to sail with Lt. Lewrie again and I look forward to continuing his adventures. He's one of my favorite historical fiction characters."
4,Cockerel In A Nutshell,Lambdin does it again in this (the 6th) installment of the Alan Lewrie chronicles.I really enjoyed this one though I must admit there were some slow points and trying to muddle through all the French was annoying.Lambdin does a wonderful job weaving history and fiction and Cockerel is no exception. The thought of Lewrie getting a leg over on Emma Hamilton is quite amusing as is the idea of him coming face to face with Napoleon and Captain Bligh.Lewrie and his well developed supporting cast will surely keep you entertained. Definitely a worth while read.
2,Scotty! When's the translator going to be back on line!,"This is the sixth book I have read in this series and while I found the first five enjoyable, this has turned into a LABOR !! Why all the FRENCH ??? Once cast ashore it seems that more and more of the story is told as French dialogue. Enough is enough!! Were this a TV show or a movie, people would be walking out or changing the channel!!And to make it worse, in many cases you have this attempt to write English with a French accent. Makes it almost intolerable to read, give one a headache. Sorry, but this is a 2 star dud."
4,"Man, if this is true, Yoko was SICK!","I like Yoko's early albums.I think she was a great artist at one time. But if what May Pang says in this book is factual, then Yoko Ono truly was a sick woman. Totally controlling, and totally after John Lennons money. After reading this book, I just wished John had stayed with May Pang. Who knows, things might have turned out a whole lot differently if he had.Fascinating read for a Lennon fan."
4,Space music from the forgotten Deep,"Inspired by the pre-historic cave art pictured on the cover, this fascinating work tries to connect us to an ancient mood/spirit which may have been the everyday backdrop of our earliest ancestors. Definitely NOT New Age, this is challenging, active-listening music that seems stripped of any familiar social references. Oboe, clarinet, didjeridoos, english horn, trombone, voice, blown conch shells and percussion are used to create floating soundscapes of pure, rich tones and cavernous resonance. This mysterious and moody music is eerily beautiful, ""subterranean"" and even charming at times."
3,Interesting but.....,"GM Park is a great Master of Taekwon Do. I have the entire dvd series. I do not think however people expect to see his students when they buy the pattern DVDs. I imagine people expecting to see him performing patterns or at least high ranking students.In the points he intervenes however he explains well and you can see how great he is.There are much better dvds out there on patterns. Anyway, do not expect to learn patterns from DVD .You should try to get a qualified instructor to be taught and trained meticulously!"
1,I don't know yet.,Ok. I only put one star for this one because I am Getting it. I will defenatly tell you what happens when I get it. Does anyone have any advice?
4,Interesting story of the top USAF ace in the Korean War,"Joe McConnell was a man driven to become a top fighter pilot. This movie tells the story of Joe as he gets selected to become a navigator in a B-17 bomber in WWII. Unsatisfied in this role, he fights hard to become a pilot and even harder to get in to combat in the skies over Korea. He became the top scoring ace before he was done. The movie ends with the tragedy of his death while test flying new fighter jets.The McConnell story showcases a period of time in America when the Cold War first turned bloody. It also shows the determination and courage of the American fighter pilots during the Korean War.The flying scenes are exceptionally good, and very authentic in the aircraft, the lingo and the procedures. Any flying or military history buff would like the movie.(Side note: I may be biased--my father,then Major Stephen Bettinger, piloted the aircraft ""Joe"" was flying in the F-86 scenes for the movie and was a jet ace in Korea himself...)"
4,Passion Behind the Scenes,"The McConnell Story tells a true tale of an American fighter pilot who served during the Korean War. The man (Alan Ladd) had always been in love with airplanes and though he had a wife and children (June Allyson), he was able to pursue his dreams and make a name for himself in a plane.The story itself is basic, but it surrounds subtle and endearing characters. They drive the story along. Perhaps one of the reasons that this film is so interesting is because of the chemistry between Ladd and Allyson. The two fell in love with each other during this film despite both being married. They used the story of the film to imagine what it would be like to be married to each other which is why they come to life in the roles. Although their romance ended with the completion of this film, their connection never died and this film serves as a reminder of that."
5,The McConnell Story,The McConnell Story is a great classic movie. Alan Ladd and June Allyson are both fantastic actors for this movie. I also love movies that are based on a true story. I would recommend this movie to anyone that love Alan Ladd and or June Allyson.
5,The Mc Connell Story,I recommend this to every one who loves the old movies.One of my long time favorites.Arrived quickly and great packaging.
3,Speech therapy to help you work with your child's speech at home,"This book contains fun stories and columns for the speech impaired child to read aloud for his parents.Talking Time, first of all, is the book for teachers in the classroom. These materials, suitable for use from kindergarten through fourth grade, guide the teaching of speech sounds and listening and speaking skills. All children can profit from a program which helps them to listen selectively, to enunciate carefully, and to speak with a pleasant voice that displays good vocal variety.Talking Time can also be used effectively by parents to extend the school child's school experiences. The use of Talking Time during relaxing time, with parent and child sharing the fun, humor, and the light of these sound oriented materials, will provide additional auditory stimulation and reinforcement of correct speech patterns. The stories and columns can become part of the parent's repertoire for reading aloud time."
1,if someone gets you this game their not your friend.,yes the wild west is always a refreshing change in the first person shooter genre. BUT if you're looking for a game with this descpition GO RENT GUN...it's alot better and you won't want to kick your self every time you turn it on.
2,"Px opening not 8"" x 10""","The photo display room divider seemed fine when I opened the box but when I went to put an 8'x10' photo in the frame I found the opening to be 10 1/4"" x 7 3/4"". I had mat each px which was expensive and time consuming. Should not have had to do that!"
4,Impressive and functional,I am very pleased with my Funeral Photography Display. I have had one for years displaying my kids and grand kids. I had it in natural and only 5 screens. I bought 2 of these for a total of 6 panels...the family grew. It looks very rich and the darker tones goes with my funiture now. I would definited recommend this as a great way to display family picktures. YOu can do 8 X 10 or matte smaller pictures.
4,Photo Screen,"We weren't sure what to expect as far as the sturdiness and quality of the wood, but were pleasantly surprised. We used it in the Golf Pro Golf of our country club to display upcoming event signs and have gotten nothing but positive feedback from the members. We will be purchasing additional screens for other areas of our facilities."
2,"Barely works on 3/8"" glass","I'm really disappointed in how this performs. It says it can handle 3/8"" glass, but it regularly comes detached while cleaning with glass of that thickness. Moved it to a 1/4"" glass tank and it works better. Guess I'll have to get a real algae cleaner."
5,Amazing,I use to have to get my hands wet and scrape the inside of my tank. This magentic cleaner works perfectly. There is a velcro like side that oes all the cleaning while the magnetic keeps it against the glass. I wish I had bought this item sonner.
5,Disk Warrior defeated 552 overlap extent allocation erros,"I'm not the kind (unfortunately) to always share my experiences, good or bad, with products. However, I must say that Disk Warrior is the BEST. My iBook had crashed, losing a year of research, two vacations' worth of pictures, etc. etc. [I'll never not backup again]. Disk First Aid and Apple's help desk were useless. I took it to professional data recovery people, who said that they'd charge me $600 whether or not they saved a damn thing. DiskWarrior for OSX did what the others couldn't -- it rebuilt my drive, and I got back every single file, zero loss. This product is truly miraculous!"
3,Didn't do what I expected,"I had a drive that was unmountable due to a mixture of corruption and a SMART-indicated failure. The hardware was accessible at the device level, but the volume was not mountable. Thus DiskWarrior wouldn't touch it, and I had to look elsewhere (Data Rescue) to recover my data."
2,Did NOT Recover Files,"I'm giving this product 2 stars because I'm sure it's useful as a maintenance utility. However, I spent $100 on it to recover my data from a crashed hard drive, and it was useless. I ran the utility three separate times, each time taking over 24 hours, and it could not find a single file. I then purchased DATA RESCUE II, and that glorious piece of software recovered all of my files in one evening. If you're buying this just to recover data, you should opt for Data Rescue II."
1,Badly Needs Update,Alsoft DiskWarrier for OS X does not work on the new dual processor Macs and is therefore useless on the new machine I purchased this software for
1,Buyer beware!,"Be careful dealing with Alsoft. I have heard bad things and I recently experienced it for myself. Very shady company. They never warned me that this product doesn't work on the Intel Macs, and when I asked for a refund (before they even shipped it!!) I was told no. Eventually I had to go to my bank to have them clear it up for me. I'm not used to dealing with customer service like that.Their checkout was programmed so badly that I didn't even know if I had purchased the product after it was all over. Multiple database errors in the scripts, warnings everywhere. It was surreal. It seems more like a fly-by-night company, but I know they have been around for a while. Don't know how much longer with this kind of service.Their customer service and tech support took 2 day to return my email!"
5,AWESOME DiskWarrior,I had trouble with final cut pro on a Macintosh G4. Then I bought this alsoft DiskWarrior and it fixed the problem! Great item. thanks
1,Don't Waste Your Time For A G4 PowerBook! It's Rubbish,"I purchased this to help keep my brand new Powerbook G4 1.67 MHz w/ max (2 GB) memory running at optimum ability. After about 10 screen freezes I contacted ALSOFT tech dept. After going back and forth trying the basic menial tasks they use from their scripts, I made some screen shots and sent them along with another request for help. They ""thanked me"" for the screen shots, and then said their product does not work with my new laptop. The only way to make it work was to boot my laptop up from another machine and then it would probably work. NO REFUNDS. BUYER BEWARE! I'm stuck with a disk I can hang from my car's mirror. It's good for nothing if it doesn't work on something that it says it will on the box. Not on a G4 PowerBook. I would trust this company more if it offered a refund, but I was told no refunds. Hmmmmm."
1,Disappointment,"DiskWarrior requires starting the computer with the CD. I have an IMac Leopard 10.5.2 and have spent hours attempting to get the CD to start the computer, hours doing all the things Alsoft recommended which included washing the CD. It hasen't ever started the computer.I also found DiskWorrior requires up to 15 minutes to load once it does start the computerApparently Alsoft is not ready for Leopard, yet continues to sell the CD.I'm out $99.00 with nothing in return. Zero"
1,"Bad experience, don't buy!","0/10. Very bad experience with this program. Won't even recognize my hard drive. Tried another program successfully (Boomerang). Got all my data back and could even reformat the hard drive.The distributor would not even consider reimbursing me, claiming that the package was open. They have to explain me how to test their program without opening up the package since they don't allow testing with a demo version. Something I could do with Boomerang and it worked.Won't buy from them anymore."
4,Apple tech recommends DiskWarrior,"I was at the Apple store checking out new Tiger OS and happened to ask the tech guy's advice on new TechTool Pro 4.0.4. I had just been online for an hour reading bad reviews on TechTool, so I was curious of his take on it. He told me about DiskWarrior and said that it was superior to TT Pro. As you know, Disk First Aid does little to help or repair serious stuff, so, from what he said, DiskWarrior is a must-have tool to protect your hard drive. He really highly recommended it. The catch is, and I didn't ask, maybe they sell them there and he was just trying to talk me into buying one. (I avoid their high prices and buy everything on line anyway.) Too bad shipping prices are soaring!!"
1,"Poor product, poor support ... waste of my money","Recently my Newer Technology Mini Stack failed to mount. Newer Technology claimed problem wasn't with the hard disk (since it appeared in disk utility) and suggested I buy a disk repair program. I spent the $ on Disk Warrior and was very disappointed. I would understand if the program couldn't save my data. But instead, the program continually crashed during every operation on my iMac G5 (non Intel) computer. It would eventually rebuild my directories, but would not repair (instead, it would crash). Then tech support suggested I copy files from the ""preview"" to a new hard disk drive. Tried that, but everything was corrupt and Disk Warrior continued to crash each time. Save your money ... do NOT buy this program."
1,Do not order this online from their website,"I ordered this software from their website to fix a non-bootable Mac, only to find that the downloaded version does not create a bootable CD. When I attempted to use the software to fix the mac in firewire target mode, it said that it could not repair the disk due to a hardware failure. However, I then rebuilt the Mac, and it appears to be fine. I do not believe Diskwarrior works properly over the firewire connection, and I clearly could not wait weeks for the CD to arrive. Deceptive website!"
3,Giving it a trial run,"Surprised by the flimsy netting when it arrived, since the description kept using the term ""tough."" We have strung it up on fence posts and will see how tough it is. In fairness, the description was clear about the psi rating, the weight, and all the other dimensions. Time will tell how long it will last - and, if possible, we'll update this review when we find out."
5,bird net,havent used it yet but it is exactly what i was after and was shipped quick thanks againjust waiting for spring
3,"Not Hillerman, but not bad","Readers who follow the jacket blurb and go into Bad Medicine expecting a Joe Leaphorn/Jim Chee mystery will be sorely disappointed.First, the Thurlos don't have nearly the lyrical voice of Hillerman. You have much less of a feel for time and space and terrain in the Ella Clah books.Second, the Thurlos spend much more time on external circumstances than on their characters' internal struggles. Even Ella's constant conflict over being a cop and not having time enough for her family seems forced.Third, the Thurlos give far more play to the supernatural than Hillerman. Progressive though Clah is, her family and her enemies are not. If you're not willing to suspend disbelief, this book won't work for you.That said, it's not a bad book. I enjoyed reading it, and found it a faster read than all but the most recent Hillerman (i.e. Hunting Badger). The characters are not as deep, but the action is paced well enough to keep the story interesting."
1,cardboard characters and repetitious writing,"Having read that Ella Clah was a counterpart to Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn, I started this book with great expectations. These were destroyed when I discovered that the book bore little resemblance to reality. Protagonist Ella, unlike most policemen, seems able to interrupt whatever work she's doing to jump in her car and drive to 'nearby' towns at a moment's notice. She always arrives ready and eager to tackle yet another emergency. Of course, the Four Corners region is huge, and travel between towns would have her driving incredible distances. The reader can't help but know that Ella possesses some sort of sixth sense because, in the first 70 pages, Ella feels 'uneasy' at least 70 times. Each colleague, (again mentioned repeatedly), gives great respect to her famous hunches. When an author repeates himself, it's usually because he doesn't have much to say. And neither does Ella!"
4,An early title,"This book is where to start in the Ella Clah series. It reminded me that I missed a whole bunch of books in the series. If you are following the character's exploits, but didn't know how it all started, this is the book to buy. In the genre of native American mysteries, this is up there with Hillerman, Doss (Utes), and Coel (Arapaho). Their characters have become old friends."
4,Afro-Caribbean Classic!!,"Copa Mundial Muzique is an excellent album. Any fan of deep, soulful and Afro-Caribbean house must have this in their collection. This album has an infectious blend of deep and culturally vibrant sounds, do yourself a favor and get this album now!!"
1,Makes you appreciate the real thing,"_The Devil's Dictionary_ has long been one of myfavorite books of all time. Ambrose Bierce'ssatirical definitions are elegant jewels of sardonic wit, hard and sparkling as diamonds.The publisher of this book has had the inspired notion of showcasing Bierce's wit by displaying it side by side with the work of a truly moronic and talentless imitator, one ""Chaz Bufe"" (a name Bierce himself might have invented for one of the ""poets"" whose works grace certain definitions in his own classic work). Bierce's diamonds of wit glow all the more brightly in contrast with the rank and malodorous cow pie that is ""The American Heretic's Dictionary."""
5,A Funny Pick Up and Read Book,"Bierce's is obviously a classic and Bufe modernizes it wonderfully in his new version which lashes out at society just as well as it's inspiration albeit with slighty more layman language. Both books (despite what some seem to think) are decidedly anti-religious and leftist. That doesn't mean, however, that liberals are left unharmed though. All in all I think it's target audience will find it a fun read and it's targeted victims will be the only ones whining about it."
1,the author thinks himself a wit -- an is half right,"'the american heretic's dictionary' is a poor imitation of bierce's classic 'the devil's dictionary'. bierce's insight and wit is a two-edged sword striking the foibles of anyone and everyone. 'heretic's dictionary' is a narrow-minded and biased attempt to capitalize on this work by throwing together some cheap-shots at those who disagree with the author's point of view. true, some of the shots are valid, but many are not really and too many are simply petty and vindictive. if you want true insight and satirical comment (still valid after a century), buy the 'devil's dictionary', not this piece of trash"
1,A loathsome and contemptable fraud upon the buyer.,"It would be fitting if I could somehow link my name, as a book reviewer, to, say, Edgar Allen Poe, and credit this review to him. Mr. Bufe has created a similar ruse, using the name and reputation of a great American wit to sell his personal hateful, condescending, bitter spite as clever social commentary. There is no wit about Bufe, and his commentary rarely reaches the intellectual level of the Dixie Carter character's rants in the television show ""Designing Women."" Where was the editor for this project? Probably the worst thing, overall, this reviewer has read"
1,The contribution by Bufe is a joke,To put Bufe between the same covers with Bierce is a joke. His contribution is simply a left liberal attack against America and an outlet for radicalism run amuck..A waste of money and dumped in the garbage bin !
2,a disappointment,This book definitely has a different tone than all the preceeding stories in this series. I did not care for the change. There was too much dissension between Torie and her husband. And why were so many people gossiping about their previously beloved and accepted Town Historian all of a sudden? Torie's mother was hardly mentioned and she was a great character in the previous stories. Also the violence level was definitely increased which I did not appreciate. The ending was very rushed and incomplete. Is this series loosing it's punch? If so--what a disappointment. The previous eight books were a real pleasure.
1,A $99 helemt for a $99 head,"You get what you pay for. I bought this cheap helmet to protect my cheap brain and I'm not disappointed - it's exactly that, cheap. Fit and finish is rough, the chin bar forces my mouth half open, the visor leaks air like a sieve. The breath deflector is stunningly cheap, a flimsy piece of foam that kinda sorta plugs into a crevice in the chin bar. Spend a few $$$ more and get a Nolan."
2,Brilliant Psychologists Are Often Boring,"Tedious, as most psychologists and psychiatrists are, Jung spends his time essentially making an argument that the phenomenon is most likely explained by a sort of mass cultural hallucination. He gives a few vague historical examples, bores you with a lot clinical talk of the possible mechanisms and then cites no good examples relating to any well known or modern UFO sightings. Personally, I think he was bored by the subject and his effort in this book to explain the phenomenon suffers as a result. It is a short book, but it took effort to finish it."
4,When UFOs appear in your own dreams...,"A must read for anyone who is ""troubled"" by such visitations, that is, for anyone who wishes to take UFOs seriously, but not literally. As a bonus, I find Jung here to be clear and forthright in his interpretations and amplifications. In unraveling the symbolism of the UFO as a carrier of ""wholeness"", Jung provides an accessible read peppered with wisdoms, not to mention a fascinating side trip into abstract art!"
5,Very nice case,I also picked this up at the dollar store for a buck and I am very happy with it.*note: I would not have paid more than five for this item because the hinge for the stand looks like it will likely break.
5,Love these shoes!,I bought these shoes for my wife and she loves them - so do I for that matter. Oh...Deer shoes are built well and have great designs. She owns three pairs.
2,Not worth the time,"This is the second book in the Unicorn trilogy. Only the first book is worth reading. (Unicorn Bride). I was so anxious to read the rest, but... it turned out they weren't worth the time it took to read them."
2,Warn CHEAP,"A real pain to mount on the plow blade. The wear bar has round holes for carriage bolts with self-locking nuts. Holding the head of a carriage bolt with vise grips while you tighten self-locking nut is not fun. I can't believe Warn would be so cheap as to not have square holes for carriage bolts. It is summer so I have not idea how junk will last.I do not look forward to removing it.After a winters use;This does not plow snow like the metal bars do, the 3/4"" thickness make the plow ride over (and pack) a layer of snow every time you plow. I have over an inch of packed snow/ice left on my asphalt drive after using this wear bar for the season. I'm going back to the metal bar before next winter."
3,Plastic Plow cutting edge,"This is a great cutting edge, however the bolt holes are not square cut to accept the round self tapping bolts. Instead the nuts and washers have to sit on the from edge of the bar which accumulates snow."
3,3rd time not exactly a charm,"i agree with the other reviewer on this film. even though it has its share of good fight scenes (the last fight being a pretty brutal smackdown) it really wasn't as good as the first 2 films. i also own the first movie on dvd and that one has one of my favorite one on one female fight scenes. its a bone crunching fight between moon lee and yukari oshima. although it was great to see moon lee back in action in the 3rd movie, the fight scenes don't quite have the same visceral impact as the first 2. the picture quality was decent for this dvd but definitely not remastered. one other thing caught my attention on this movie though... was that panna rittikrai in the thai kickboxing match scene? he is tony jaa's mentor and personal trainer. what a cool little bonus huh!"
3,Durable roof vent.,The vent is a like for like replacement for the vent it is compatible with. It is a better vent cover than the plastic OEM covers.I am giving it a 3 star because out of the 6 I bought 1 did not have the bracket spot welded on the lid. I recommend a receipt inspection ASAP. The other reason may be perception: the spot welds have no galvanized coating for rust prevention. I put a little paint on the spot weld to maintain its integrity. I have not let a cover be exposed to the elements with out the paint so I can not say that the spot welds would rust out or not.
5,Great Product,"I just started using this, been through the oxidation and polish. I have not got to the wax yet. But this has produced an incredible result. I could not believe the difference. Get a orbital buffer, this takes work and having a buffer will cut down on the amount of elbow grease!!"
5,Wow is this great on my RV!!,"If you don't have a buffer (which I don't) expect sore arms but you will be rewarded. I had a pretty heavy haze on the front cap of my travel trailer and with just one pass of the oxidation remover, the surface was beautiful. Followed up with the polish and then the wax and the 4 year old trailer looks brand new again. I am so impressed. Even made the light covers sparkle!"
4,Works great,"We used the oxidation remover using elbow grease and really liked the results. The next day we went and bought a small inexpensive buffer (Turtle Wax brand @Wal-Mart for $20)and finished up some rough spots with the oxidation remover and the buffer. Now we wish we had the buffer from the get go! I did not care for the polish so I skipped that step and went straight for the wax, step 3 and loved the results. You will only get back as much as you give so be prepared to really work hard if you don't use a buffer."
4,worked as advertized,"The product worked as advertised .You must do all the steps ,but at the end of the season I still had that milky look on the hull."
4,Works wonders,Made our jetski (13 years old) look like new!! Was not too hard to apply and was definitely worth the results.
5,Meguiar's M4965 Restoration System,My husband reports that these products have done the best job of any he has used on our 2002 motorhome. He is very happy with the results of his work.
3,"this stuff probably works just fine, but...","this stuff probably works just fine, but...it doesn't perform miracles. If your gelcoat is in really tough shape better off with a new paintjob"
1,Disappointed,"Have an '85 Pontiac Fiero with a oxidation, fading and blotching in the fiberglass finish. Knowing the Meguiar name, and having been satisfied in the past with other produts, I bought this product with the expectation of it helping restore the finish, at least a little, as I'm not much for expectations. It didn't. After all three steps, the blotching between the fading sections and good sections was more pronounced, and other problem areas were not helped at all. I had better results before with a cheap liquid cleaner/wax, and about the same with some polishing compound. The product is not worth the price or effort. Skeet Pick in San Marcos, CA."
5,Outstanding,"I read this book when it first came out to review for our library collection. It has always been one of the books that has stood out in my mind as an unforgettable. It is terrific not just for the youth but also adults. It is an exemplary biography for an exemplary woman. Julia Morgan was one of our countries first women architects. It is an excellent biography for girls and the general public. An excellent comprehensive read of one of our countries finest architects. I highly recommend it for someone looking for an oustanding, informative, inspiring fun read for our youth."
2,Not what I expected,"The book was shorter and smaller than what I expected. After visiting Hearst Castle last year and hearing about this architect, I wanted to learn more. I think that there are better books out there."
4,"A good adventure story for boys, and of particular interest to Ayn Rand fans","Pretty good...sort of a typical boy's adventure story of the early twentieth century, but a good one. The writing's a bit uneven, but I don't know how much of that is attributable to the original and how much to the translation. It doesn't have a very strong plot, but the story is good and there are some strong characters. You can see why it would have appealed to young Alisa Rozenbaum living in Russia, and the influence on the adult Ayn Rand as a writer is obvious. Definitely worth reading...kudos to the translator for all his work in bringing this out!"
2,Fiberglass renewing product,I purchased the 3 step oxidation remover (polish and wax also) and it did NOT live up to my expectations. I had fiberglass that was really oxidized. I followed the process and I am very disappointed by the claims made. I would NOT purchase this product again based on what it could NOT do which is remove oxidation. It did make the fiberglass a little brighter but nothing to write home about. I feel like I wasted my money.
2,This Product May Damage Your Paint,"This product works absolutely great to remove sap, black marks, and dirt embeded in the roof of an RV. Unfortunately, any residue or placement of the product on painted cap tops or the side rails of the roof results in quick UV fading and peeling of the paint. I will avoid using the product in the future and look for something safer for painted surfaces beyond the white roof top."
2,Thought it would be better.,"I thought these were actual towels or towel like. They seem more like rags, size and all. The material is tough, although it does do what it's supposed to. But it could definitely use some improvement.If you're looking for a soft drying towel for your pet, I wouldn't use this. But if you're looking for a good kitchen rag, good at absorbing liquid, then it's pretty decent."
3,I returned this because it is not what I thought it would be.,"I thought this product would help me to located my little one in a crowd, but it is meant for fire fighters and other first responders to find his room in an emergency. I am sure this is a great product, but not what I needed."
1,WW2 propaganda,"This documentary was made before the end of WW2 and it shows. It seems made to convinced the audience that their allies of the time (USSR and China) are good, free countries and Nazi Germany is the devil incarnate. For exemple, they go into great details explaining that the USSR is a great democracy and the Stalin is a good ruler. Interesting for seing how can our 'good' western countries can ally itself with an horrible dictator such as Stalin and try to convince its people he's not so bad after all. But that's about it."
4,Put it in your suitcase,"As always, Eyewitness has the best maps. The coverage of Seville makes it the best guide for that city, period. The coverage of the outlying major areas, such as Granada and Cordoba, should be supplemented with the Cadogan book on Seville, Granada, Cordoba, but the Eyewitness has the best information on eating, shopping, getting around, hotels, and culture survival for Seville. If you are staying in Seville, take this book with you into the streets when you go."
1,Worst transaction ever thru amazon,We purchased these and they were the size of my pinky nail. Plus I was charged twice for shipping because I bought two of there products which the shipping charges were outrageous. And they were delievered in the same box. They were so light in the package. I just figured I would chalk this one up as a real lesson learned. And yes the company would take them back. But with all of the shipping charges it was just best to throw away and be done with.
1,VERY DISSATISFIED,This item is MUCH smaller than described on previous page. I anticipated the measurements being in inches as described under Product Details but when I recieved it the dimensions were less than 2 cm high. This product would not work for what I purchased it for.
5,Another great release from the greg man!,"I've been a fan of gregs for years, his phrasing and composition are unmatched by anyone in his genre. I really liked this CD, I think I prefer the groove style he has on paralax view a little more then the neo-classical stuff that is the more dominant style on this release but hey...he has the right to do something a little different, and he does it better then anyone else. truelly an amazing musician...you should have all his releases in your collection. forget about petrucci...listen to greg howe"
3,Good over grip,Switched to this grip about 6 month ago because they were slightly cheaper than the Wilson over grips. The feel and quality are very similar to the Wilson. I like the product and would order again.
4,Excellent Value Compared to Similar Overgrips,"I was a long time Wilson Pro overgrip user before trying this product. I bought a pack of these locally because they were a few bucks cheaper than the other overgrips and was pleasantly surprised. They are every bit as good as similar Wilson, Prince, Head and Yonex overgrips and always cheaper anywhere I've looked for them. If you like a soft, tacky overgrip you should definitely take advantage of the value these provide. However, if your hands sweat a lot these are NOT for you (try Tournagrip), and I have noticed that these get a little mushy in extremely hot and humid weather."
1,Too Hard to Clean,On the surface this item looked like it was exactly what I wanted but it was not engineered well. It is made from many different pieces and there are many places that catch food making it very difficult to clean. I returned it for the Wearever aluminum model which is one piece.
2,Not a Chinois!!! Be Careful,"I am not a chef, but I am always trying to find good equipment to cook like a professional. I learnt about a chinois in a recipe book and wanted to get one to make smooth puree and broths. A chinoise (sometimes chinois) is a conical sieve with an extremely fine mesh, and a china cap has large holes in it. This item is stated as a chinois and it is actually a China cap which cost much less and does not give you that smooth puree of finely strained recipes.Chinois always sell for muh more than China caps and so far I only see one on Amazon.Dont waste your time of money if you are trying to get a fine mesh strainer - get a real chinois instead. I kept mine anyway because I also needed a China Cap for some of the asian dishes that I like to make and this comes in handy for just straining, but I dont use the presser for this as it can push small solid ingredients through and will not give you a smooth consistency f you desire."
3,Too Small,"I have been looking for one of these for quite some time but was so disappointed when I received it. It is way to small to go over a normal mixing bowl. The legs can only straddle a very small 6"" diameter bowl so if your doing sauce or something the only way to do it is put the legs and all into a giant flat bottom pot or roasting pan. Not very well thought out at all. The one I use to have was much larger. So disappointed. Not good for canning or doing any large quanity of sauce."
3,A little too small,"The chinois seems a little too small and light to take the pressure of trying to squeeze tomato pulp, seeds, and skin out from the cooked tomato quarters. The wooden handle, while beautifully made, isn't up to the job. It works, but at the cost of some elbow grease."
3,It's Okay,"This product is okay. I sent it back. The holes are to big for passing through pastry creams or raspberries puree, etc. I would suggest a double mesh strainer instead of this product."
1,"Not really a chinois, but not a bad China cap.","A chinois is a conical fine mesh strainer. A China Cap is conical too, but it's made out of one solid piece of steel into which many small holes are punched. China caps are useful when you don't mind the holes being a little larger, but I bought this because I wanted a chinois. It is, unfortunately, not one.I'm somewhat sad giving it one star because as China caps go, this is a decent one, but the mislabeling is downright rude."
2,useless,"I got this for removing seeds to make jam, it doesn't work very well. Either you don't get all the fruit or you get bits of seeds in your jam. It is small yet cumbersome, has LOTS of sharp edges and is a nightmare to clean. Mine cost $49 at a local store and I will never get my moneys worth out of it. It will sit in a dusty storage area til I get sick of looking at it and donate it to the Salvation Army. A very pricey mistake."
2,Less than impressed,"Well when I ordered the press is was not what was in the picture. The picture shown was an older Mirro press like I wanted. The stand is not as sturdy as the Mirro press and the cone and pestel is not as big and has a pointed end, not round for mashing. It does not have the curved edge around the top that makes it easy for the peelings to just come out in your juice. I guessd if it is what you are use to, it might work just fine for you"
3,This is NOT a Chinois - it is a China Cap. Don't be fooled.,"Not a mesh chinois at all. It's a China cap; a solid metal cone with holes stamped into it.It's well made, solid, and beautiful. Good piece of equipment.But don't be fooled by the picture - I think it's the low resolution of the photo that makes it look like this has a mesh screen, like a chinois.But it doesn't."
2,not quite right,This would have worked perfectly if the strainer holes were a little smaller. I used mine to make tomato juice and there was a little too much pulp caused by the holes being just a tad too big.
3,Incorrect Picture,"So, this is actually a china cap, not a chinois. Although the picture shown is a mesh seive, ie chinois, the product shipped is a perforated steel, collander type set up which is actually a china cap. Great for straining soup but not for custards, fruit purees etc.Had to return it."
2,Disappointed!,This Chinois set isn't as strong as the older model. I used once only for making grape juicy and the stand has bended and the mesh looks like coming apart. Very disappointed!!
3,It's ok,"It is smaller than I imagined and I thought the handle would come off, makes it harder to store. Just have to do small batches and be creative."
3,Juicer,"love the design especially the pointed stick,was easy to use,holes in collander are too big let seeds go through in juice,was somewhat hard to clean"
5,Works Well,I am using this for canning tomatoes. It does a good job removing the seeds and skin. Nicely made.
5,Excellent Product,"This unit is exactly what I was wanting. It's very sturdy, well constructed and the delivery was great. Very satisfied with my purchase."
2,"Good intentions ... but just OK ""Intentions""","So when it comes to lesbian romance and the movies, the bar is not high. There's way too much misery and death and not enough kissing and comedy. Which is why this movie gets two stars. Yes, production values could be better. A lot better. The acting is self-conscious. But its heart is in the right place, and so are its love scenes. The characters don't die. It has moments of amusement and some of the dialogue rings true. It's worth a rental."
5,Beck's Intentions captures the heart of the moment,"""I've had that conversation before!"" ""I feel like she's telling my life story"" are just a few of the many positive comments I heard when watching this movie with a group of friends. Beck manages to beautifully capture a simple but honest story about discovering ones sexuality and risking it all to figure out what you want and who you are. The lead actresses are superb without being over the top, and the story is nicely paced. I think most people (particularly women) will enjoy this movie, regardless of their sexuality."
1,Don't bother,"The production of this film looks very amateur. In some scenes, the sound is so bad that it's hard to understand what people are saying. The storyline really doesn't do a good job of capturing your attention, and I found myself fast-forwarding through most of it. A real disappointment."
1,"If the Intentions were a bad storyline and horrid acting, they scored big!","The story is about a student who has an affair her married teacher. The student tries out for a part in a play the teacher is directing and they end up falling for one another. The kicker is the story revolves around acting, the play and theatre at the college - BUT the actors in this movie were terrible! The scenes and filming screamed low budget. The lines were awful. It was painful to watch. I can't believe I sat through the entire movie. I think I was hoping it would get better. It didn't.Save your money. This movie stunk."
1,Abysmal,"I find myself in total agreement with the first review. Every aspect of this movie was dreadful. The acting, if such it could be called was pathetically amateurish, the story line overused, the script lame, the dialogue monotonous and the music was so clicheed that you could turn off the picture and still know what was happening on screen. There was no magic between the principles and nothing that I could see that would have induced a mature , sensible woman to make such a radical change in her lifestyle. I am a great fan of what is generally referred to as the ""lesbian"" gendre,personally I don't think it exists outside poorly made movies, and this one fits on the lowest rung of that category, along with "" Girl Play"",and Aprils' Shower"", and too many others to mention. It was a total waste of money and should have carried a toxic label."
1,ugh...,I bought these a couple of months ago and they just stopped working. I really liked them when they were working.It's a shame :(
2,I sorta hate these,"I'm not fond of these headphones. The sound is pretty good, but they annoy me. First, the cord is way too long and it ALWAYS gets super tangled up more than any other headphone cord I've seen. I hate how the cord for the right headphone is attached at the left headphone, instead of them both coming from the main cord. It's really dumb and really annoying because you have this long, stupid looping cord just hanging out around your neck/chest that just dangles there and is really annoying when you run. The ear stems are a little funky as well. They are just hard to keep on, especially when I'm running. I definitely won't be getting another pair of these."
5,10 Years old and still work perfectly!,"I just thought I should leave a review for this product, I bought these earbuds 10 years ago( I know this might seem unlikely but Im sooo honest) I really bought them 10 years ago at Sears where I used to work and I am still using them, I use them everyday for 8 hrs while at work and nothing has happened to them yet, the cord is so durable it tankgles all the time cus I just throw them aside when I log out of work and go home but the cord has not shorted nor broken in any way, also the sound quality is awesome and the only thing wrong with them is that I have worn out the pad on the ear phone clippy thing, so I am now buying a new pair just cus I want another and also buying new foam for the ear part to keep these ones going that I already have, but trust me when I say that the $20 I paid at the time I bought these were to me a steal for the quality I have recvd with them! Hope you also find these to be the best ever ear phones!"
4,The Ticket!,"I feel guilty for holding back a star to only giving this product 4, but it's honestly hard to ""love"" a simple tool.This is a great product and easy to change out. It gets all my ""like"" even though I save my ""love"" for guns andsportscars and ladies and such.Great product!"
1,Joshua Bell - Nobel Prize Concert,"I can't speak to the quality of this recording because when I got it I couldn't play it on my Bose. I returned it to Amazon and, while I was on vacation, another copy of the same CD arrived. I tried it and it too will not play on my machine!!! So, I give up - I will return the CD and get my money back."
3,Really - really not impressed.,I was really not impressed by this BR.I should have wait longer to buy it for a cheaper price. It would make no difference.The concert is just fine.Do not expect a great-great performance - it is a very good performance. Well decorated and rehearsed.Cheers to all.Marcelo
2,Mr. Bell need to learn what music making is.,"Mr. Bell pops up almost non stop everywhere. I have never seen a performer of his statue so over exposed. He may have all the technical skills of playing violin, there really is no music making here. He plays like a teen ager, with no musical maturity. Further, his over active body movement is a real distraction."
3,Music,"the concert is superb, however, I did not realize I ordered a Video as I wanted the violin concert only.but this had nothing to do with the quality of the video. That video is certainly nice for people who likewatching videos of concerts - I do not."
2,Lord have mercy. . .,"With Act Your Age you get your typical pop/punk album, which isn't a bad thing. However, this band doesn't even come close to the likes of Blink 182 and MxPx. Yes, they do have some catchy guitar riffs and the rest of the usual pop/punk formula which should add up to an album full of catchy songs. However, the vocals on this CD are ridiculous and seem to get worse as the album goes along, and Homegrown finally reaches its lowest point with the last track ""Reflections,"" which is just flat-out embarassing. There's just something missing in this CD and its a good lead singer. Act Your Age is definately not worth buying. If your in to this type of music skip Homegrown and buy something from a good band like the Suicide Machines, Goldfinger, or Blink. Trust me, you won't regret it."
3,Chris from p.s.l.,"i am the biggest mxpx fan and i'mm a big fan of blink 182 (old stuff) when i finshed listening this cd their was something that sucked about it and i did'nt know what. the gitars were great,the beats and fill in's were great, the base lins were great. i guess it was the vocals, got anoying after a while."
4,Many good songs...worth buying,"This is probably one of my favorite Cds in my collection. Homegrown is an awesome punk band...especially in concert. Heart-felt songs with a twist of slapstick humor are just the beggining of this Cd. The three best songs on this album would have to be...""Nowhere slow"", ""Suffer"", and ""Let Go"", although just about every song is worth listening to."
5,a catchy punk infused album,"I loved this CD and like many who buy this album keep listening to it months after i've bought it. It's fun, catchy, and very funny. There's a lot of true lyrics and songs in here that'll make you sing a long and the beats are so fun to just bob your head around to. I LOVE THIS ALBUM! So go out and buy it, oh ""Surfer Girl"" is just a great song!"
3,way too emo for me,"homegrown is one of my favorite bands, i love there music and i love them, there first cds thats business & wusshappanin' was so much better then this one, this cd is alot more emo, homegrown used to be punk, now with this cd, the became emo, its a good cd if you like emo but if you like your punk harder get thats business i dont think they sold out you dont see them on mtv so what if they sold out to the radio there all so hot i love them anyways"
5,One of the best cds I've ever heard!,I have been obsessed with this cd since day one. Homegrown is one of the best bands around and to compare them to blink 182 and mxpx is an insult. Ever single song on this cd is just awesome. I've listened to it religiously for as long as i can remember and anyone who doesn't like it obviously doesn't know what they are talking about
5,Did you ever notice?,"I'm not actually writing about how good this CD is, Even though I really enjoy it and it's one of my favorite albums of the 90's I was just wondering if any one else ever noticed about the song ""she's anti"" It kind of reminds me of Columbine. If you listen to the lyrics it's oddly similar to what happened at the school, The song talks about the girl being anti social, hating everyone, pessimistic and cynical, She came to school and went ballistic, there all dead? With a rifle in hand? I'm not saying that the song is the reason why they did what they did, but even the date that is given in the song, April 28th is close to the actual date. April 20th 1999. Maybe they heard the song and used it as motivation? I don't know I'm just saying. Take a listen for your self and see!"
4,Where is Angel on Paper?,"This is a fine collection, except that it is missing one of her most impassioned songs: 'Angel on Paper'. This song has such a pathos that it is comparable to Juliet's Soliloquy."
5,A very comprehensive reference,"This book is basically a collection of monographs, each on a different integral transform (and most by different authors). There are additional sections which are general references, but they are probably redundant to most people who would actually be using this book.The book is a bit weighted towards Fourier transforms, but I found the Laplace and Hankel transform sections very good also. I also learned a lot about other transforms I didn't know much about (e.g., Mellin and Radon transforms).This book may be the best reference out there for non-mathematicians regarding integral transforms, especially regarding the lesser-known transforms. There are plenty of other books on Laplace and Fourier transforms, but not so on most of the others.I liked the worked examples for almost each important property of each transform. For me, that is how I learn these things."
1,This is NOT the Starlite Orchestra,"I bought this CD because I have other Starlite Orchestra cds that I love to mellow out to. The music on THIS CD is NOT played by the Starlite Orchestra. If anything, it is some guy playing on a synthesizer, taking advantage of the Starlite Orchestra name. Good thing I only paid about a buck plus shipping on this piece of junk, because that is more than it's worth. There are plenty of other Starlite Orchestra CDs that ARE the real music of this fine small band, but stay away from this one!!!"
5,Outstanding Re-release,"Having any available recording of Donald Sinta is a benefit to the musical profession at-large. Needless to say, he is a rare artist who transcends the saxophone genre, and it is unfortunate there isn't more of a recorded legacy of this major performer/teacher. As reflected in the reviews of his work by major critics over the past thirty years, he is indeed one of the most gifted wind soloists ever, and any musician can learn from his artistry. Students of the saxophone 'must' have this important re-release by New World Records to hear how one should play beyond the limitations and aesthetic constraints of this misunderstood classical instrument."
4,This is not your walmart dry erase board,"I was slightly skeptical before purchasing this dry erase board. Many of the lower price range boards available on Amazon had poor reviews about being warped and twisted - and since I needed a 2 x 3 board, I hoped to get a board that didn't have any problems. Fortunately, I did! This board is extremely sturdy and mounted very well on the wall. No problems with Expo markers and Expo board cleaner thus far. Previously, I had purchased a Quartet board from Walmart and the thing was a piece of trash that held up for about 5 minutes. I'm so happy to have found a better quality board at such a good price here. As usual, Amazon's shipping was prompt and I'm happy with the purchase. This is a great option if you don't have two hundred bucks to put down on a high-end dry erase board from Staples or Office Max. I can't tell the difference, honestly."
1,screws don't fit anchors,"You do your measurements, drill 4 holes, stick 4 anchors in, only to find that the screws go right through the anchor."
5,Great product,This dry-erase board is great! It was the perfect size I was looking for plus it is very good quality. It is easy to erase and it is very sturdy. Very satisfied with this product.
1,Not this one!,"Unfortunately there are way too many ""Greatest Hits"" or ""Best of"" choices from Atlanta Rhythym Section. Seems that most of them are remakes. If anyone knows which ones include the ORIGINAL VERSIONS of their songs, please let me know. This is not the one!"
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I bought this CD, and the artists are not the same as the ones who sang the songs in the 70's! I know, because I compared my vinyl versions, and they're not the same! On the CD I purchased, the song ""Doraville"" was supposed to be on track 2. It was, but it was also REPEATED on track 6! DO NOT BUY THIS CD!"
1,Not The Real Deal!,"I'm usually pretty careful when ordering/buying CD's to be sure the songs are performed by the original artists. In this case, I wasn't careful enough because had I read the reviews I would have know that the songs on this CD are not performed by Atlanta Rhythm Section, althought there is nothing to indicate otherwise in either the description or on the CD itself. These are bad recordings off tempo and off key in some cases. If you were looking for the real deal, forget this CD. It went right into the trash."
1,New Recordings NOT the Originals,"I bought this with the thought, as others who have reviewed this CD, that it was a low cost collection of my favorite ARS songs in their original form. How disappointing that this is a another of those re-recorded versions that older bands who get back together decide to put out to jump start a stellar career that died long ago. I LOVED ARS and still do. I don't believe that they meant to decieve anyone as to the content of this CD. This appears to be a condensed version of ""Atlanta Rhythm Section '96,"" a CD that by its title implies 'remake.' The band for that CD had three original members left, including Ronnie Hammond, the lead singer during their heyday. The blurb for ""ARS '96"" says that ""the live-in-studio sound presents a different, less polished take on some classic tunes..."" That applies to this CD as well."
1,Buyer Beware!,"The key item on the cover is ""All Their Best""! They aren't performing the material. The tempo is off in spots, the vocals suck rocks, no backing vocals......yada yada yada. I wish I had read the reviews first. Save your time and money and find an original recording."
3,Decent Collection of Songs,"In their heyday, the Atlanta Rhythm Section walked the funkier side of the Southern Rock street dominated by Lynyrd Skynyrd and The Allman Brothers. Their biggest hit was ""So Into You,"" an extended version of which kicks off this collection. Other highlights include the more Skynyrd-sounding ""Doraville"" and ""Jukin"" as well as ""Champagne Jam."" ATS, unfortunately, does not get the due they deserve on classic rock radio these days, as one listen to this collection will demonstrate."
5,A unique series,"Packed with delightful British expressions like, ""Are you bent?"" (for ""are you gay?""), this series about a hapless bunch of four English friends is at once hilarious, bawdy, and endearing. Each of the boys, is a loser in his own special way, and they all have distinct personalities. Indeed, it's a wonder they hang around each other at all. That's part of what makes the series so enjoyable. If you enjoy British style comedy, you'll love this."
5,Kenneth Cole Black Gift Set,Bought this last year for my son as a Christmas gift. Very satisfied and good price.
5,Sci Fi at it's best.,"Just for the seriels alone, this set is worth it. But I am also a BIG Rocky Jones fan. I wish they would release all of the episodes. I also love the Flash Gordon. Captian Zero is ok. Not to much action in it , though. It is a weak show."
1,Here comes Tobor DVD,"Well I for one have liked Here Comes Tobor, and for one of the kids who saw the first Tobor The Greatthis movie is a bit of a let down, but overall the movie is fine, maybe I'll show this to a future grandchild some day and they may enjoy it, the Capetian Fathom and sea divers were OK, and Counterspy was another cold war film again great for collectors of this type of film overall enjoy this collection."
2,rip off from PD,"Now, it's true, there are a few programs here that might be worth viewing, but there are two serials stuck in the collection that can be downloaded from public dormain websites; Radar men from the Moon and the Phantom Empire. The price might be too high for this collection even if the majority of programs are basically pilot programs (ie The Shadow). If the price was lower minus the serials it might be worth looking into.However, for my money, I won't buy it."
5,A Lot of Fun!,"Worth every penny! Remember those Saturday morning TV shows when you were a kid? This is it! This set has a lot of good vintage TV shows and 3 Movie Serials including the excellent ""Radar Men From The Moon."" Have Fun.Classic Sci-Fi TV - 150 Episodes"
3,Sci-Fi old movies,Picture quality of some of the old TV series shows are not very good. It amazes me that the 30's and 40's western movies on Western channel are such good quality compared to the Sci-Fi TV shows from the 50's. On these Sci-Fi DVD's the picture is smooth and there is little little loss of action but they lack sharpness making hard to see details. It is if they are just a bit out of focus. For the money it is acceptable.
3,Base size,Was hoping to find a broader base that would help prevent obvious indentations in the vinyl floor covering. Locking nut would have been nice to have for keeping adjusted height in place.
4,A slow start that soon takes off rather quickly!,"Its take a minute or two to really get into the book but once I got going it was hard to stop. The writing is good, keeps you entertained and sticks with a storyline. I focus on this becasue of all the choppy, awkwardly written erotica novels out there these days. Its a feast for the senses so go ahead and dig in!"
4,"M-D 24""Tile cutter","Very good price for this item purchased through Amazon, the cutter works great, would have given 5 stars, but when i used it first time it was cutting out of square and had to be adjusted. Would not have expected this with a new cutter. However all good now. More than happy"
4,Easy to use ski holder,"Went looking for a rack for my skis, I wanted something I could take on and off with ease. The Inno Grab Max Universal does just that. Very secure, have taken skis on long trips with no issues. Well worth the price. It seems to be pretty secure but I would not trust leaving my skis in it overnight. This speaks to all ski racks, but since the unit is mostly plastic it seems it could be more of an issue."
1,BEWARE!!! DOES NOT FIT ROUND BARS,"Description says it fits round bars but the picure on the box shows it only fits oval and square. Instructions inside says to get an adapter for round bars. Of course Amazon doesn't carry the adapters since they think it fits round bars, so I found them at another website for $40. Might as well spend the extra money and get a quality item from Thule or Yakima. These do seem like poor quality the upper part of the rack hits the lower plastic piece before closing and looks like it will eventually cause damage. I will be returning these and have to tell one of my friends they can't go snowboarding this weekend."
5,Stylish in every way,"This is indeed a handbook, and it does indeed cover punctuation and, indirectly, writing style. It's so witty and entertaining, however -- even a bit racy, although never in a crude way -- that it's fun to read, and not at all ""handbook-y."" I recommend it highly; embrace your inner semicolon."
3,New and improved = Lost its charm,"It's a real shame what has become of this book in revision. The original was a tiny collection of wonderful sentences, with the occasional dry rule of punctuation pretending to ride herd over the lot. Much of the humor came from the interplay between these two, like a straight man setting up his partner for a punchline. In the expanded version, the discussion of punctuation rules runs along for paragraphs and pages, and has gotten too clever for its own good. The delightful examples, who used to hold center stage, now get lost in the commotion. This is probably much more useful by way of instruction, but the original's simple charm is nowhere to be found. Maybe you'll want to own both."
1,Not good for learning.,"This was required reading for a grammar class, and it was not what I would choose as a good reference. The author tries to be different, quirky, or elite with the styles of grammar and their rules; it just comes off as a confusing mess. Yes, there is a table of contents so that you can zip along to the chapter involving comma's and such, but what you get is about 3-4 pages of examples (not always very good ones) of the usage. I appreciate the author is trying to simplify by writing a short book with all of the pertinent rules presented, but to me, it is just not enough of a reference. I almost feel as if I have to got back and skim through a ""blog post"" to get the correct usage. So you better remember it, or you will be searching through this one. I much prefer The Elements of Style by Strunk and White. It is a much cheaper and timeless reference."
5,My Favorite So Far,"Sigh, finally a historical romance written today that I could not put down. I've read roughly 5 novels of this series, and this one is my favorite so far.I love that our heroine struggles physically. How often do you read a book like that?But the Hero stole my heart. From beginning to end. And probably because Beverley regularly spends some time illuminating the readers to his point of view, which often she forgets to do in other novels.I also prefer the role-switching, wherein the female is the titled character and the male is the ""undeserving fortune-hunter."""
2,Much prefer Ms. Beverly's Georgians and Medievals,"After giving four of Jo Beverely's Regencies a try, I think I'm going to stick to the other two time periods that she does so well. Hazard was a disappointment. The first hundred pages were a charm, true brilliant Jo Beverely writing, sexual tension and honest plot complications from two people caught in their time, places, and circumstances. But, unfortunately, the book began meandering, the hero and heroine spent hundreds of pages apart, and the final wrap up didn't require that we go through the several hundred pages of proposals, engagements, elopements, kidnappings, et al.I highly recommend Devilish and Lord of Midnight for wonderful, wonderful Jo Beverely romances. And I'll just let the Regencies alone."
2,Not her Best,"I usually enjoy books by Jo Beverly but Hazard bored me. The only real ""problem"" the main characters had was the unsuitability of the hero. I realize this was a big deal for them but really, a whole book concerned with the heroine thinking about it? I enjoyed the beginning, got tired of the middle, skipped to the end and enjoyed that."
2,Too Dull!,"I gave this book 2 stars simply because of the length of the story, figured it must count for something. JB is very talented, but when she misses the mark, she really misses it. How can an author create such interesting characters and such dull plots all in the same book?This book took forEVER getting to the heart of matters."
3,Lacking in Oomph,"This was a technically sound book but just not that interesting.After being jilted twice Lady Anne Peckworth is ready to do whatever it takes to find the right man for her. In her case doing whatever it takes mainly involves just getting out of the house to meet men and not being deliberatly off putting. There is only man who sets Anne's heart a flutter, but he is below her station as a Duke's Daughter -- and aware of that.It is a decent story, but the two main charectars don't generate much genuine heat or passion. It lacks in genuine feeling."
5,"My 40gal freshwater aquarium is so tough to clean, or WAS!","I didn't even know there was such a thing as a magnet cleaner for aquariums. I found this product as I desperately searched the internet, and Amazon, for cleaning solutions/ideas.I used the magnet cleaner today, it took algae off I couldn't TOUCH with the long handled blue scrubber I bought at Petsmart. That was alot of elbow grease for very little effect. This is much easier and much more effective. And, you can store it in/on the tank! Very strong magnet and cleaned my slightly bow-front aquarium easily. Corners not as easy/effective, but still, better than the scrubber."
5,"Works well, but be careful of the strong magnets.","This thing really does work well, but for goodness sake, be careful when you're putting it into your tank. I hurt my fingers no less than 4 times.. Once taking it out of the package (SNAP! on my fingers), once taking a closer look at the plastic bumps on the inside piece (SNAP!), once trying to rinse them off at the same time before putting them into the tank (SNAP!), and once when removing the lid on the tank and trying to hold them apart (SNAP!). My wife was not particularly amused at my idiocy/language the whole time. No permanent damage, but holy moly did it hurt.AS for the actual product review, it works well. Cleans the inside of the tank very effectively. You should probably only use this on a glass tank; I could definitely see this scratching acrylic."
2,"Not so effectiveso convenient, not so convenient","I used this product several times after I received it, and fount out it is not so good at cleaning algae from fish tank glass, in general. I went back to old fashion stick and sponge. You do not need to get your hands wet if you have a long stick. On the other hand, you will always get your hands wet using Mag Float Cleaner. But the bottom line is that this is not doing a good job cleaning."
5,As Expected,"Just as noted! it cleans came in a sealed package, the magnet is strong just as you would expect. Fast"
5,The Cleaner Magnet,"The magnet does what it is supposed to do, handles a 55 gallon tank np. I'm sure they would work well on a 200 gallon also."
5,great investment,"ive had one of these for years, then i got a tank that was too big for it, this one works wonders on my 72 gallon tall"
5,No more FISHIN' around in the tank..,"This simple improvement makes this aquarium floating glass cleaner a thousand times better than the original.I used to have to get a stool to stand on and either find a grabber tool or dive in up to my elbow to retrieve a dislodged cleaner from the bottom of the tank.Now if it slips away it's on the top of the water bobbing around like a toy boat.The magnet is also much stronger than the one I replaced and it cleans the yuck off in one swipe.All in all for a small purchase this one improved my life and that's what a "" new and improved "" product should do."
2,Ehhh,Wish the magnet was stronger. Not as great as everyone claims I still have to use other means to clean my glass
2,will scratch,I bought a set of these and I tried them on my glass aquarium but it scratched my glass aquarium even though I rinsed the pads to ensure it did not have any debris. The scratch was towards to top of my aquarium so I know that its not that I picked up gravel and dragged it.
4,Tek this cd home . . .,"Sit back and enjoy this one with a glass of Crystal and a good lookin' friend. Off DJ Shadow's label, Quannum, Lyrics Born and Lateef come together as Latyrx (La-teer-ix) to lay down smooth Barry White lyrics, relaxed melodies of The Meters, and tight beats with the attitude of Marvin Gaye. ""Lady Don't Tek No"" is a classic that you must hear."
1,"Darkwatch: Amazing looking, Pathetic performance!","Length:: 3:49 MinsHey, this is my first review, couldn't sleep, was window shopping, literally in this case. so please enjoy, I'll be reviewing other games soon, thanks for watching! :)"
3,dark watch is a flippy,now this game is awesome with some really cool graphics but the thing is there are no big bosses to vs.Only at the end do you get that chance.Also its pretty cool you can choose your destiny.But another thing i hated was after you beat the first level it all seems to be the same thing and there is only 2 short horse levels.You might as well get the game goldeneye it seems like the same game to me but a little better.
3,Fun but short,"After seeing the TV commercials and the cover of the game I just had to get it. Not playing any demos or seeing anybody else play it I decided to purchase this on what I saw alone. Now the real question is was it worth the $50?.... NO not quite. The graphics and controls are good I admit but my only main flaws was the storyline could have been more in dept. Some of the characters (like the Darkwatch Gang)voiceovers were kind of cheezy, the levels were too short and I beat the game in 2 days (not even playing the game for long periods of time). This game is worth buying and worth keeping for replay value if you can find it at a cheap price. I wish I waited till this dropped to $20 - $30 or better yet just rented it. Save yourself some cash and rent this for a weekend, you'll have no trouble beating the game by then."
5,Darkwatch is a fun game to play,"Darkwatch is a good game with easy controls ,fun to play and the best western genre game out there Jerich Cross an outlaw bitten by a demon vampire .ot to get the darklord and kill the minions and also to save the town people for these evil creatures send them to the pergutory in his brain and free himself from the demonic curse .with Jericho he has a cool horse Shadow ,the games fantastic Ibelieve it,s one of the best games i,ve seen ."
5,Absolutely Beautiful,Bought this dress for my 4 year old granddaughter. When it came I was thrilled with it. It is a beautiful dress especially for the price and I can't wait to see her eyes when she opens it for Christmas. She loves to dress up and look like a princess and this dress fits the bill perfectly. The dress is well made and the pearl buttons and pearls on the lace are a lovely touch. The only problem will be getting her to take it off. Will definitely buy from this vendor again.
1,Deceived by the Title,"I was deceived by the title, thought this was a Cinderella name brand dress. Cinderella is actually a better quality and could have gotten it at JC Penny for about the same price. I was not pleased with the material, it is very thin and can see right through to her legs. It does not come with a build in slip (like Cinderella dresses) to give it more body so now I will have to purchase that too. Not a very smart buy."
2,Shabby construction,"I was so excited when I ordered this dress, and was shocked when it arrived. The construction of the dress was horrible-the little white flowers on the skirt were hot glued on, sequins and beads were loose and falling off the bodice, and it was not fluffy and full like the picture-rather the skirt was skimpy on layers. The sizes were also odd. I measured both girls very carefully, as these are flower girl dresses, and while the length was fine, the bodices were enormously too wide. I am very disappointed in the dresses, but in my excitement to get them took off the tags, so I can't even get my money back. I will not be ordering from this company again."
1,the dress is horrible,"We ordered a toddler dress, the quality is awful, it is falling apart, the belt fell off on the first day, the buttons constantly unbutton, the tulle skirt is falling apart, we are afraid to wash the dress. I would not recommend it to anyone"
1,In Less Than A Year This One Has Already Died!,"Lame experience!In less than a year it will not burn dvd's.I get errors that say it is bad hardware.When I first went Plextor (thanks to all the wonderful reviews)I had to return it the second day and get another.Not a good sign!This one worked, but not anymore.I DO NOT recommend this Plextor dvd burner!!!I do recommend NEC and YAMAHA"
1,Slot Loading Is a BAD IDEA!,"Funny, I have a slot-loading CD player in my car that has never refused to eject a disc. This player started having problems ejecting media after the 3rd or 4th time I used it! (I ruined a few DVDs by having to grab the tiny exposed edge with a tweezers...)Spend your money on a drawer model instead."
1,worst plextor i ever own,I expected better from Plextor my 3rd drive in 6 months junk drive beware of this drve will not read disks two drives same problem on 3rd drive i own two other plextor they are good not this one
2,Can't Recommend Plextor,"I've had a Plextor 708 DVD burner for two years and have yet to successfully get it to burn a movie from a file. The Roxio software bundled with the device seems like it has lots of bells and whistles, but I can rarely get it to work correctly and often turn to other, simpler software. The Plextor often fails to recognize data CDs or DVDs that it has burned until after restarting Windows. As a glorified CD burner for backing up files the Plextor is competent, but for anything more demanding, look elsewhere"
3,Good drive until it went dead right after 1 year,"This drive installed easily and worked well with the media I used (Verbatim and FujiFilm).However, at 16 months the drive stopped reading DVDs. I've had other burners that have lasted for over 4 years.Tech support was great. They answered my calls within 5 minutes, and, happily, they were from the good old US of A and easy to understand."
1,Piece of Junk,"This unit is a total piece of junk. I bought it because of great reviews in PC Magazine, PC World etc. and all it's supposed great features. Bottom line, I used this drive very little and it died on me after about a year and half. This drive replaced a previous Plextor that also died before its time and Plextor did nothing to help me as they have only a one year warranty. Lousy product, lousy after-sale support."
1,no more plextor for me :-(,"Had a 712A originally. At just over a year it died and was replaced. When that one died, I got a 716A. Now it appears to have died, too; and it hasn't been used that heavily at all. I like my Plextools software, but frankly, my next cd-rw dvd-rw is going to be some other brand which hopefully will hold up better. I am disappointed in Plextor drives and service overall. I can't blame Amazon for this purchase; they have always been very good with their service on items they sell directly to me."
1,plextor: you do not get what you pay for,"I just wanted to pipe in that I also, was one of those people that had this drive fail on themMy drive was manufactured in February of 2005, and It lasted monthly burns for 370 days, then it failed. It's got a one year warranty, I used it 12 times to burn CD's/DVD's and it fails. Hows that for reliability?! Stay away from this company!Maybe I will give the highly rated Samsung a shot..."
1,Plextor vs. ASUS,"Bought this unit for Christmas. Had it installed by computer tech. Software splash page would appear but clicking on links crashed machine. Reinstalled, uninstalled and reinstalled no luck. Computer tech installed it on his personal machine same result. Both machines have latest motherboards and exceeded the minimum hardware requirements. Contacted tech support and have been passing emails for over a month now with no help from Plextor. Went and bought ASUS burner for half price and installed perfectly and runs great."
1,Plextor Technical Support SUCKS!,"I can't believe how POOR Plextor support is. You would think that they would have an answer for a drive that does not read ANY cd's (music, data, games, etc.). I e-mailed tech support and there FIRST response was to RMA the drive!! This means shipping the drive back to Plextor at my expense! And then waiting forever to get a USED drive back! That's right, if you RMA a Plextor product you will get a REFURBISHED product back. These things have been RMA'd thousands of times so there is obviously a serious flaw in their hardware profile. I will NEVER purchase another LOUSY Plextor product."
3,Not What I Expected,"Deford's book touches mostly on the personal lives of and relationship betweeen Mathewson and McGraw. If that's your principal interest, then it's a fine book. But the author says little of substance about the transition from the Deadball Era to the modern game. If that's your principal interest, then look elsewhere."
2,Not as unique as advertised,"This was a well written history of New York Giants at the beginning of the 1900's. However, I didn't feel it told me much more that I've read over 50 years of reading baseball history."
4,My first Deford book,This is the first book by Frank Deford that I have read. As a newish baseball history buff I have enjoyed the book. Listening to Frank Deford on NPR for many years now. I enjoy his writing as well.
2,How Frank DeFord Failed to Create a Book,"I agree with the reviewer who says this feels like a heavily padded article. In recent years, a number of wonderful books with original research have come out on McGraw and his era (such as Baseball's Radical for All Seasons, Hit Em Where They Ain't) but this book ignors them, and adds nothing new. Deford's book is written in the smarmiest language possible. Mr. DeFord loves writing but I didn't love this book."
4,Get to know Jerry Falwell,"My sister received this book when she asked for information on Liberty University. (I guess Jerry has a bunch of these in a warehouse) She chose to go to Bob Jones and I got the book. This book is a good read, It tells about Jerry growing up and how he came to Christ, as well as the history of Thomas Road Baptist and other ministries. It ends when Jerry Falwell took control of PTL from The Bakkers, though if you want the complete story on that you'll probably have to go to his newer autobiography. If you want to get to know the man behind the iage read this book"
1,Doesn't work as described,"I even ordered the recommended ""spark plug wire induction adapter"" to no avail. The adapter does not fit this particular model even though it states it fits!!"
3,Specs. incorrect on Amazon,"I agree with RTV Owner and Robinhood ...the specs on this tach (when I purchased it) stated it would work on small engines, which is the only reason I bought it. I was very puzzled when opened the package and found settings on the back for only 4,6 or 8 cylinder. I plan to keep it and have purchased a tach signal converter to see if that works if not will resell on ebay."
2,Equus 6088 Tachometer,"This tachometer will NOT work on 2 cylinder engines, it will only work on 4,6 or 8 cylinder engines. You may want to ignore what ever else you see on the Equus spec sheets you may see/find online. I didn't bother to try making this thing work, I looked at the spec sheet included and at the back of the tachometer and is clearly states ""4,6 or 8 cylinders"". The back of the tachometer cannot be seen without taking it out of the package.It looks like it was worth the price.More to follow on my experience with Auto alley on their willingness to exchange or return this product."
1,Book for class,"This was exactly what I expected- it's dry, but presents interesting ideas. The end of each chapter has a ""food for thought"" section, which poses interesting questions and ideas to think about."
1,Horrible,This video was worthless. A waste of money. I dont even know why it was uncensored. They showed nothing but concerts. This was bad
2,Don't trust this product,"It says it's a hardcover but I got a softcover -- a really flimsy softcover. It looks like something someone made in their basement with a photocopier. I am sure the technical merits of this text stand on their own, but the quality of this reproduction are not worth the price. I have contacted amazon and asked them to correct the product page (if necessary) -- certainly I'd be cautious about ordering this product."
2,Couldn't see all of the illustrations,"Although the written directions were most helpful, almost all of the pictures in the book were so dark I couldn't see them. Sorry."
4,Java 2 Fast & Easy Web Development w/CD,"Hmmm, where to start.This book should proably be titled ""Java 2 for beginners who have not had Object-Oriented Programing"" This book was the ""last"" of many I used for my Intro to Java 2 course. This book gives clear examples of Java and the OOP relationship. After I used this book, everything just ""clicked"". The only thing missing is ""Swing"". I wrote the author and he said the editor wanted to keep the number of pages down, so Swing was taken out. I would like to see a 2nd edition to include Swing.The Author did a great job! This book is not for experienced programers unless they need to understand OOP.This book was a lifesaver for my Java 2 course."
4,java 2 a fast and easy understanding,"Having thumbed through a few books in a local bookstore I found that many were either treating the user as a complete idiot or someone with a programming background already. What I enjoyed about this book is that the author really seems to be speaking to the student - rather than a matter of fact ""this is how it is"" - he leads you through the course explaining everything in detail - and explain WHY he's explaining it in detail without being patronizing.I ""got it"" very quickely :)(I only give 4 stars because I do not think this is a good book for absolute programming beginners - but then I don't think Java is a good language for absolute beginners either)"
4,It is fast and easy,"I am an experienced Java programmer who recently started teaching Java to previously non-technical students. I searched weeks to find a book that would make it easy enough to understand java, without trivializing the subject. This book was perfect. The easy instructions really helped my students ""get it.""I would highly recommend for anyone who isn't familiar with the language to start here."
4,Book For Web development is made easy for beginners,"It's very good book really. It helped me too much. the manner in whichthe book is, I really like it and appretiate it. This book will beranked 5 stars by me. As without handling Html Documents Javaweb Development is not completed.But really it helped me too much"
1,This was a piece of trash,Did not meet expectations at all. On top of that the entire plot and acting was extremely bad. I definetely would not recomend this CD to anyone. Bottom line I threw my money away. This CD was part of the weekly trash collection.
3,Tomato Corer,Got the product quickly. The corer was a little weak in the construction around the neck. But gets the job done.
1,It easily broke in two while removing it from the packaging,"This product completely broke apart while removing it from its packaging. Hopefully, this is a fluke. We will seek a replacement and try again."
1,what a waste,The first time I use this the metal part folded at 90 degrees to the handle. I think that sums it up.
4,Works great,"No problems, it works as expected with both tomoatoes and strawberries. Used it for both, and bought another for my mom."
5,Witty and Revealing,"Jerry Robinson cleverly illustrates student misunderstandings found on student schoolwork. I really enjoyed his mastery of English vocabulary as he played up all the misdirection new words can create for children learning our language. Adults don't always realize that a child's understanding of the world and what they hear come out of adult mouths goes through the child's unique, but undeveloped filter. ""True Classroom Flubs and Fluffs"" reveals how easy it was for kids to get mixed up (or creative) in the middle of the 20th century. After witnessing that it is just as easy for kids to miss meanings and pronunciation today, I plan to use this book in my classroom as a fun way to clear up some confusion and open discussions on current student ""flubs and fluffs."""
4,not bad,the hands are very thin but work ok. Can't put the 2 together which is what I wanted in the first place. But they are good anyway.
5,great!,"Brave Daisy (wearing cute blue overalls, red polka dot shirt, and red sneakers) goes on dares proposed by her friends. nice short book about being brave, minimal text per page."
4,Fun Story,"Anyone who has ever been `dared` can relate to this lively tale about a daring young mouse who seems to know no fear, until one day, when her friends come up with the scariest dare, yet: to take the bell off the cat`s collar. Is Daisy up to the challenge? Is she really as brave as she says? The large print text should help preschoolers recognize easier, more familiar words, although this is definitely a read aloud picture book: the overall vocabulary is likely to be beyond the early reader level. Colorful, energetic illustrations will engage and amuse: a fun story."
2,not good,"Reading S.L. Viehls' books (I believe this is a pseudonym.) This is the first I was able to actually read through. That said, it was just not good."
2,"tries for clever, succeeds at confusing","Could this author have tried to keep the plot more close to the vest? This book I found to be boring and confusing, simply because the author tried to have a surprise around every corner, for example, circling for 5 pages about someone's relationship, just so she can spring the fact that they are actually father and daughter on the unsuspecting bad guy. I found myself turning to the end of the book to find out the big secret, so that the rest of the story would be mindly intelligable.Truly not worth it. And I disagree with the previous reviewer. Linda Howard and Elizabeth Lowell are far superior. This is not a worthwhile substitute."
4,This fan sez: A good album.,"Well, if you're the kind of person who listens to Tom Waits just to cultivate that ""I'm the kind of guy who listens to Tom Waits"" image, you will probably be disapointed with this album. You know who you are. High schoolers who get off on doing things that the other kids think are ""Wierd."" I used to be one of you. Then I grew up. Why will you be disapointed? Here Waits pulls away from that precarious cliff of sheer musical madness that he flirted with (oh-so delightfully, IMHO) on Black Rider and Bone Machine, keeping the best elements of those experiments while reintroducing some more of the traditional elements of his earlier work. Not that I'd ever call Mr. Tom traditional. No, sir! In all, this album isn't his best, but it isn't his worst. It's like a mellower version of Bone Machine, and, if you're a fan of the actual _music_, and not just the image, you'll probably dig it. I do."
5,I Love it!,"This is my favorite Tom Waits CD. I keep coming back to it when I'm not quite sure how the world is turning.Checkout ""House where no body lives"" and ""What's he building in there?""A Master class for any musician!Steve ""The Doctor"" H."
5,His best work,"This is my favorite Waits album, the one that has moved into my mind and soul to live, whereas the others, as great as they are, just visit. They're guests. Mule Variations is family."
5,Top stuff,"Right. Just try and forget all that Tom Waits has done before. Treat this like the only album of his you've ever heard. Maybe even the only album he's done. Now. Just think about how amazing an album it really is. Everyone has a tendenct to say ""Aaah it's not as good as Rain Dogs or Swordfishtrombones"". It is as good. It's just different. I've listened to a lot of Tom Waits stuff and this has got to be one of his most unique albums. People say that all the songs take from his earlier work. This may well be, BUT, regardless of how he did it, he has managed to produce songs that are completely unique. Well that's just what I think. It's one of my favourite Tom Waits albums."
4,3 and 1/2 stars rounded up to 4 for Mule Variations,"Tom Waits's newest is not disappointing... but not exactly thrilling either. With ""Big in Japan"" and ""Chocolate Jesus"" Waits proves he hasn't lost his sense of humor. Once again a refreshing mix of unusual instruments prove he still has the capacity to be as innovative as ever. That being said, some tracks seem oddly contrived; ""Hold On"" and ""House Where Nobody Lives"" in particular. Some tracks are so reminiscent of previous songs they feel more like filler than original material. Overall? Probably not as inspired as the beloved Rain Dogs album. Then again Rain Dogs would be hard to beat, even for Tom Waites himself."
4,Mixed Feelings,"As an avid fan with all his stuff I was a little disappointed with how similar to earlier songs many of the tracks are, but hell .... it's better than just about anything else that came out last year. Amongst my friends and associates, those who know his work are moderately positive but those who have never heard him before are astounded and enthralled ... which should remind us not to take this guy for granted - the man's a legend!"
3,dried up...,"(3 stars out of 5) overall (2 stars out of 5) in comparison to other waitstom waits has dried up physically (in that, he has quit drinking) and artistically (in that, ""mule variations"" is his worse effort of the 90's)... as a VERY devoted waits listener for more than a decade, who owns all of his albums... ""mule variations"" simply is uninspired (similarly as uninspired as the ""hollywood and vine"" era waits)... as usual, though, there are a few solid tracks to be found (regardless of how uninspired a waits album is, it will always deliver something of worth)... if you are as devoted as i, you already own this album... if you are not as devoted, buy ""rain dogs"" or ""swordfishtrombones"" or ""small change"" or ""bone machine"" or ""franks wild years"" or ""blue valentine"" etc rather than ""mule variations""... they would all provide a more solid foundation to the start of your waits collection..."
1,YIKES!,"This is one of the worst albums I've ever had the displeasure to try and listen to.Aside from the drunken,groggy,sounds-like-he gargled-with-a-mouth-full-of-razorblades-voice,the music itself has little merit.I've always suspected those who claimed to like Waits music(if you wish to insult the medium)are typically of the pompous,wanting-to-appear-deep crowd.You don't have to listen to obscure,crappy music to be deep,or to pose as deep."
2,Formulaic Tom Waits?,"That's what it sounds like to me. With the exceptions of ""Cold Water,"" ""Filipino Box Spring Hog,"" and ""Come on up to the House,"" there's not much of interest here. Contrast this album with his great stuff (from Swordfishtrombones to Bone Machine) - it just doesn't match up. The ballads especially, while pretty, are boring and cause no emotional response (unlike his good ballads like ""A Little Rain"" from Bone Machine). Somehow I knew this album was not that good, which is why I held off buying it for over a year. Tom's stint as America's premier original musical genius might be done. Or maybe he can still turn it around, as there's still a couple of brilliant songs here."
5,The Legend Lives On,"Although Tom may not have the nicest voice he has something that many of today's artists don't; that is emotion and soul. This album is not very humourus so don't expect it to be, but the lyrics are orgasmic and Primus even makes a gurest appearance on Big In Japan. If you like old-fashioned blues you should love this album. Or if you like great song writting Tom waits is the way to go, [....] Highly reccomended."
4,"A ""memory"" album","I can't convince myself that Mule Variations is a great Tom Waits album, Swordfishtrombones, Bone Machine and Rain Dogs are all superior. Still, this is the one that sticks with me. In the summer of '99 I was in love and travelling through Europe with some great friends. This album became the soundtrack for all our adventures. It is more romantic than the previous mentions and does a great job of establishing a rapport with listeners. It helped me to see the humanity in Tom Waits, and it gave me something to relate to in someone who I had previously seen as a wild Uber-hipster. I don't know if it was the timing, or what, but I hope others can enjoy this album the way I have."
3,I CAN NO LONGER REMAIN SILENT,"here's the deal, folks: THIS ALBUM IS INCREDIBLY AVERAGE. it's hard for me to believe the praise that is being heaped on this record, which is in many ways the weakest of Waits' career. where were all of you when Tom was releasing true masterpieces like BONE MACHINE or SWORDFISHTROMBONES? my only guess is that the majority of those who are so impressed with MULE VARIATIONS must be ""new"" fans who simply don't know any better. trust me, kids: the stuff on this record is such a regression that it verges on parody. go out and get the records i mentioned above (or RAIN DOGS, FRANKS WILD YEARS, or THE BLACK RIDER) and you'll see what i mean. now, enough with all this ""Best Record of 1999"" nonsense...."
3,Only 3 Stars For Waits,"I've been listening to Tom Waits for over 20 years and he is one of my favorite artists, through all his reincarnations. While there are some really fun songs on this album (Big In Japan, Chocolate Jesus), on the whole the ""shtick"" is just too transparent here. Waits has always played ""characters""; but usually the songs are so strong that he pulls them off beautifully. Here they aren't. They're OK, but not as good as his past (or future - Alice, Blood Money) efforts. Might be better than 3 stars for most, but not for Waits."
2,A Parody of a Tom Waits Album,"You know how sometimes an artist will come out with an album that the critics suggest is merely a self-parodic gesture, a give-the-people-what-they-want work? The Rolling Stone magazine review of Bloodflowers by the Cure comes to mind. Well, Mule Variations is just such an album. This is the sound of Tom Waits coasting. This is Tom Waits giving the people what he thinks they expect from him. On this album you've got a little bit of everything that people have come to associate with Waits, but none of it done as well as in earlier days. You've got the depressing country songs, the ""Going Out West-""type song, the screeching nonsense. The only thing missing is the big band stuff. None of it is done with the same panache and creativity as on previous albums. It's just a make-time album, the act of a man bored with his own career."
2,Drags ass,"2 1/2Somehow Waits weaves a small spell by the time the whole album is through, but by and large this is the sound of someone, who made sounding tired so refreshing, sounding tired."
5,it reminds of why I think there is a god.....listening,It's in the choice of key signatures. Once again in the key of some empty house(s) and brilliant but not cast from the shadows. Thanks I needed these toones.
5,A-crawl with demons!,"What can I say of the man's work that hasn't been said by all of you fine, reverential fans before? I've been sweating for this latest installment for the last six years, and now I can feel it in my veins, breaking my heart, restoring my faith.After listening to ""Variations,"" my assessment of this whole ""they sound like earlier songs"" debate is this: I think (unconsciously) Tom takes up the same song many times over the years, squeezes it, sniffs it, sees how it has aged, and then gives it a newer body in which to live. Call it reconstitution, call it creative reincarnation. How many other songwriters can honestly say that their songs deserve to be reborn every decade or so?Kind regards to all of you Raindogs out there."
5,Still listening after 2+ years,"I bought this album the day it came out, and it is still something I listen to all the time.Some people have said that it is too derivative of his older work. Well, even if that is true in some respects, I would say that doesn't make it bad. Just because it isn't different in style from something he has done before doesn't mean that it isn't just as wonderful, or better, than the first time around.That being said, I don't really think it's all that derivative of his earlier work, personally.It doesn't matter what you call it - or what you think it derives from - what matters is that the songs themselves are amazing, the album is an incredible and cohesive whole, and you just can't beat it... thinking about it now, it may actually be my favorite CD that I have ever heard. Certainly in the top 3, and the other 2 are probably Tom Waits, too."
4,Grows on you,"It's great to hear new stuff, especially if you have seen or own everything else he has. If Bone Machine was your favorite in the past, you'll have to give this one a chance. It has to grow on you (like a creeping vine). Waits on this albumn reminds me of Leonard Cohen. (He's the poet whose ""Dear Jane"" letter said something like: ""I love you but I love the idea of a clean slate more."")"
5,Tom Waits comes home,"There's a fairly consistent thematic march through Tom Waits's albums from shady characters through increasingly outrageous and dangerous types down to Bone Machine. Bone Machine is about death and usually hell. The question with Bone Machine was, where to from here? It took me several passes through that album to be able to appreciate it. What could go further?Redemption. Mule Variations is the most thematically different album of Tom Waits's career. When all is said and done, in a world of Bone Machine, you got to get behind the mule every morning and plow. People who think this is a retro album aren't paying attention.""House where nobody lives"", however, is the first clunker I've heard from Tom Waits."
2,unfortunately uninspired...,"Owning every Tom Waits album,I really wanted to like this one, but I didn't. It just falls flat. Of course there are a couple of good ones (it IS Mr. Waits after all). But on the whole, it's not a must have. Get Swordfishtrombones if your searching for a begining in his hobo-tramp years, or The Heart of a Saturday Night for his beatnik-piano-man years.I hate to let one song ruin an album for me, but ""what's he building in there?"" does just that. The song reminds me simultaneously of this old Saturday Night Live skit where Steve Martin repeated asks ""what the hell is that?"" and Bone Machine's ""the ocean doesn't want me."" Both these skits worked the first time, but to re-hash them goes about as far as Weekend at Bernies II."
3,Waits seems like he's recycling earlier songs.,"Nowhere near up to BONE MACHINE or RAIN DOGS. A lot of the tunes sound like reworkings of previous material with new lyrics. I guess you can't keep coming up with fresh stuff indefinitely, sooner or later the ideas sart drying up.....it's happened to folks like Lyle Lovett, Richard Thompson, Chris Isaak and others.Tom should have called up Ry Cooder and invited him to play on the smokier tracks. Cooder's touch on slide would've added a lot."
5,A hillarious musical romp,This album shows the flexibility of this great songwriter to write for any genre. It is both witty and deep. It's highly reccomened to any music lover!
5,Incredibly enough...,"Tom Waits is still as good as I thought he was when I was sixteen years old and first heard ""Closing Time."" My seventeen-year-old daughter thinks so, too. What a world."
1,Everybody falls,Just skip it. Assume he's never done it. Everything else is still so very good. And he remedied himself in Blood Money anyway.
1,YIKES,"Tonight I'm glad that we're allowed our own opinions in this free US of A. I'm one of the few writing in who HATES this album. Honestly, halfway through my first listen, my roommate threatened to move out if I kept playing it. I agreed with her. This is not even worthy of frisbee use. I'll stick with his early years albums, which are not as nearly as abrasive. Seems to me that he's just being obnoxious here for the sake of it. If I wanted random disturbing noise I'd turn my stereo off and listen to the traffic. This is not music."
1,Nice Scent ; but made me itch and dried me out,"Irish Spring Aloe dried my skin out and made me itch which is odd because it has Aloe. I thought I'd give it a try and I did like the scent, but I am going back to DIAL soaps."
3,Priced right but others are better,"This is a fairly priced soap. It works okay if you're really not going to be working out or doing something to cause you to sweat. Otherwise, it just doesn't get you clean. My husband smells as bad as he did prior to getting in the shower after using this soap and has to take another one. The price is right, but if you sweat or perspire at all during the day, don't expect it to really do the job. Try Old Spice's soaps. They're just wonderful in getting rid of body odors and keeping you clean. The best thing about this Irish spring soap is that it lasts a long time in the shower and it's shape is very conducive to holding in your hand."
4,Worth getting if you want to be complete,"The extingencies of deadlines often force comic publishers to farm out a couple issues to backup artists in order to give the main crew a break and time to catchup on the main storyline. This represents such a collection of stories.A different set of artists is used for each story. (In one story about the Saint of Killers - the backup artist couldn't meet the deadline and a backup-backup artist had to be called in to finish the story!).The stories vary in quality - particularly in the drawing and coloring. The plots concern background information about the Saint of Killers and Arse-face. Whereas the main Preacher storyline is brilliant, this particular collection is just average.I recommend buying it if, like me, you have to own every Preacher graphic novel. If you are not so obsessive, then rest assured that you can continue to enjoy the Preacher series without reading this collection."
3,This one doesn't cut it,"I'm a fan of the preacher series but I didn't like this book. I don't have a big problem with the part about the Saint of Killers except that Ennis directly stole a lot of it from ""The Unforgiven"". The Arseface section was ok too. I hated the section on Jody and his deranged buddy. This book is seriously lacking when you compare it to the first graphic novels in the series. I've read the first 8 graphic novels in the Preacher series and this one was my least favorite."
3,Not Completely Bad,"I am only going to stress what the other reviewers should have put more emphasis on. This book DOES NOT have any bearings on the main Preacher story and therefore SHOULD NOT have been collected as ""Book 4"" in the Preacher series. It should have been collected, like ""Alamo"" as a standalone book. The first story, chronicling the Saint of Killers' origin is just OK. Not as good as these other reviewers would have you think. It's not bad, it's not really great either.If you're just starting out with Preacher, get Book 1 in this series. If you have read the first 3 books and want to continue in that storyline, skip this and come back to it after you've finished the other books. You will miss NOTHING by skipping this book."
1,"Terrible ART, Terrible writing, Just plain TERRIBLE","This is one book not to get. why? WEll, first of all, the art is lacking. The writing is predictable and boring. And the importance of this work is nonexistant. Why bother telling the story of Arse-face, Saint, and such without telling something WE don't know? Why bother writing a special with no real significance? It's boring. It's ugly. It's silly. Preacher is one great series. This is one that readers could do without. Trust me, you ain't missing much."
2,The most worthless comic purchase ever,"I love the Preacher series. I love the dark humor, the pathos of the characters, the dichotomy of the overblown story set next to a really simple plot; the love triangle.What I didn't like about the series was this book. ""Ancient History"" single-handedly brought down my faith in the first three graphic novels. It destroyed completely the momentum and the feel of the Preacher series, and it cost me fifteen dollars in the process. The backstory, aside from the Saint of Killer's story, is completely irrelevant. And even the Saint of Killers doesn't really need to be explained; we all know he's a homicidal badass, right?My advice; save your money and your time and move straight in to Dixie Fried."
4,"Pretty good, but not great.","Overall, I would say that this was an enjoyable, but ultimately forgettable volume. As some other readers have said, this is most notable for the origin story of The Saint of Killers. It is brutal and raw, and certainly has the dark humor of the rest of the series. I personally feel that the Saint of Killers, especially as exemplified in this story, is the template which Ennis drew from when creating the title character to his new comic, ""Just A Pilgrim."" The Arseface story was good as well, and a little more sentimental than the usual Preacher stories. My least favorite was the TC & Jody storyline. It was entertaining for a bit as a parody of the Hollywood action-movie archetype, but the joke got a bit old after a while. If you are just starting the Preacher, I wouldn't say skip this, but don't expect much in the furthering of the story of Jesse, Cassidy, and Tulip."
3,Could have done without,"Being a huge fan of Preacher, I, of course, own all the volumes. This is probably my least favorite. While the Saint of Killers storyline remains entertaining throughout, Arseface's and Jody's felt more like filler to me. They both have their moments, but all in all, I could have done without this one. I found myself getting bored in some spots along the way, especially amidst Jody's tale.This book in no way contributes to the main story arc, so if you have to go without a volume, this is the one. If you're someone that likes to have entire collections, then go ahead, but, knowing what I do now, I probably would have skipped this entry."
5,Senses-Reeling Greatness,"This book in the incredible ""Preacher"" series is a look at the backstory of some its side characters. The best one of the bunch? The origin of the Saint of Killers. One of the most brilliant origins ever written, and it fits perfectly.I've given this book a five star review, despite it being the weakest of the series. That should tell you something right there. You can read the others without reading this, but then you aren't getting the full story -- not even close. It is the glue that holds it all together, and it deserves a place in your library."
1,mislead,This DVD is not about the Environment or Ecology or Pest Control in the traditional definition..... its s bunch of kids skateboarding ---
5,Good quality computer animation,I found a copy of this in the $5.00 bin at my local Wal-Mart some time back and thought it looked interesting. I don't feel you are ever too old to enjoy a good animated film. Though I felt that the dialogue of one of the robots (Zeus) seemed a little stilted over all it's good clean entertainment suitable for even the very young. The only thing I regret is that the saga isn't complete in one volume. You end up with a cliffhanger unless you get a copy of the 2nd volume at the same time as you pick up the 1st. Young children will probably find it very entertaining.
5,Ireland's Greatest Hits.,Great songs and voices. I love Irish music and particularly the nostalgic ones. I have some Irish in my background.
2,wasn't impressed,"I was expecting upbeat music like you'd hear in the pub. Wasn't that at all, plus the CD was scratched."
5,The songs are fun and John Gary is wonderful,"I bought this album because it features John Gary whose voice is so pure and wonderful. No one comes close to him for his beautiful renditions of songs. Years ago, back in the 60s, I had (and still have) the vinyl records of John Gary, including his Irish album and was delighted to find John on this album. No singer can do justice to ""Danny Boy"" and ""My Wild Irish Rose"" and others, like John Gary. Now I wish I could find John's Christmas album on a CD."
4,"wise, rueful, funny and thoroughly enjoyable","OK, OK, so I'm an Oriole fan, and still grieving Jon Miller's departure for points west. I admit it. Still, I think I can objectively say: this is a terrific read. Miller is smart, opinionated, and articulate, and he *loves* baseball. Moreover, he is acutely conscious of the game's history, and the lessons and perspectives to be gleaned from it. More important, he exhibits a fine sense of humor that doesn't stop at his own doorstep. Any serious baseball fan, anywhere, should enjoy this book."
1,hype and cheap shots -- a disappointing book,"Almost everyone Miller has worked with he claims is ""the best,"" and his biggest inspiration.After all of that fawning, he tears into recently deceased people, whom he apparently wouldn't have taken on when the were alive and waited until they had passed away to bad mouth them."
2,"Great band, Mediocore dvd","This is overall a dissipointing dvd from the greses most well known black metal band rotting christ. The dvd features 2 live shows, the first filmed in 1996, this is the better of the 2 shows but lacks energy. The second show was filmed in 2003 and seriouly lacks energy, and the mix is HORRIBLE, they did a very bad job at giving you the full live experience. I do not recomment this dvd."
3,Hilarious photos but a book in desperate need of editing.,"For hardcore Yorkshire Terrier lovers only, this book recounts the exploits of a heroic little four-pound World War II vet named Smoky who just happens to be a dog. This could have been a terrific book if the author had only sought the assistance of a capable ghost writer or a tough and skillful editor. Typos, non sequiturs and irrelevancies abound, and much of the book is tough slogging. Having said that, Smoky's story--especially the surprise ending--makes a tale (or should that be tail?) worth telling, and there are some truly classic photos accompanying the text, including (my favorite) a not-to-be-missed shot of a Yorkshire Terrier parachuting."
5,Yorkie Doodle Dandy,"This was a wonderful book. This book is the story of William Wynne and his dog Smoky. Smoky was a yorkie that William found wondering loose on one of the island he was deployed to. This is a wonderful story of the incredible bond of William Wynne and his best friend Smoky. This book also is a record of World War II in the Pacific. In this book William Wynne tells Smoky's story. In the book, the comes in a complete circle leaving the reader amazed. I highly recommend this book to fellow dog lovers, fellow Clevelanders, and people who appreciate and have an interest in World War II."
5,THE BRAVEST LITTLE YORKIE,"Yorkie Doodle Dandy is not just another story of a man and his dog. It is a real life story of a miracle and I guess what is meant to be will be. Mr. Wynne finds his little Yorkie literally in the middle of nowhere on an island during a war. I don't want to give the story away but it shows the bonding that can take place between owner and pet and what sacrifices will be made for each other. Be prepared to laugh and cry. If you have Yorkies, like I do, run and get this book. If you don't have Yorkies, read this book and you will want a Yorkie. My deepest respect to Mr. Wynne who is one of those rare people who truly understands dogs."

2,Plus size seemed like a regular size. Didn't fit me.,"I ordered plus size pantyhose and it stated that it fits most plus size women. I am 190 pounds, so it isn't like I am extrememly overweight, and they didn't fit me. I even double checked that the pantyhose said plus size because I couldn't believe that they wouldn't fit me. The price was right, but make sure that you aren't overweight or tall. I didn't return them because my sister could fit in them, so I will just have to look elsewhere for good crotchless pantyhose."
1,Nothing like the picture,These pantyhose weren't anything like the picture. The hole was much larger thanthe picture. As a matter of fact there wasn't any material that connected the legs at all. The material above the hole was only about a 2 inches wide and it didn't even get over the hip area once you got them on
1,Bought these for my girlfriend (she asked me to)- She hated them!,"My girlfriend asked me to buy a pair of these for her to wear during our date night because... Well, let's just say ""because."" She isn't huge or anything, but we ordered a larger pair just to be safe, and they barely fit her. The sizing information for these seems to be completely wrong. The hole didn't really line up well with her because they were a lot smaller than she thought they would be and they ripped a little the first time she put them on. I know they're cheap, but come on- ripping the first time? In addition, she said they felt a bit uncomfortable. She didn't have as much fun as she thought she would have with these. I thought they were kinda sexy looking, although they felt cheap to the touch. Especially once they were on, she asked me to feel how they felt on her leg, and they felt like they were going to come apart (in a bad way) to the touch. If you or your girlfriend/wife want a pair, go for something more expensive."
3,Come on people !,These things cost a couple a bucks. Be real they are not made for a big night on the town. But for a night in and that is what they are great for ! And really if you are buying them for everyday use more power to you but you would need to spend more.And ladies if you are getting more then one or two at the most wears out of these after your guy sees you in them . Well you need a new guy ! LOL as he should pretty much be dang ex cited and after the love making is done you would expect a snag or three.
3,Ive never been completely satisfied with anything from Leg Avenue.,"And this is no exception. This sizing is at least accurate on this item but the quality is ""off"" Still, for the price, I'd probably go with this one again."
5,The search for the sisters continues,"Kalin and Julin have found their older sister Seilin, but she is not what they expected. Cruel, calculating, and disbeliving, the pirate queen Seilin fights with the other two, demanding proof that she is their oldest sister. But halfway through the fight Bai Wang shows up and steals one of the bells. A fight between Bai Wang and a newcomer named Drake destroys Seilin's ship, forcing the pirate to join the girls against a common enemy."
3,good for girls and bad for boys,im a boy.ok well story dosent make sence+bad art=its ok.i think its confusing how her name was jule and now its julin?.! anyway kinda dumb and stupid plot and bad art.good for girls 8-14 and stupid for boys 7-100.
1,Don't buy this edition.,"First things first, it's Timoshenko. There's nothing I can say that can adequately describe his absolutely superb analysis and lucidity.But this edition is a disgrace. It's basically just a bound photocopy of a prior edition now out of copyright. But it's not a ""clean"" copy! Right there on page one, are hand-written notes by some previous owner of the one that was copied, and as you read through, more and more instances become apparent. It is very annoying. Clearly nobody thought fit to bother to clean up ""their"" proof before trying to make royalty-free money off it. And worse, while handwritten notes are preserved, some of the illustrations and diagrams are not - one is illegible and therefore meaningless, and others lose significant detail.Seriously, while it's great to keep Timoshenko's superb works available, don't support such shoddy republishing practices - Timoshenko deserves much more respect."
4,The best animated series on TV,"I am glad the team who does this series has been allowed to further the Star Wars story in this animated series. I've collected each prior season, and intend to collect all seasons as they become available. They do a magnificent job with the artwork, animation and storylines.I hope now that Disney has bought Lucas Films, they don't screw up this series and or team, and let them continue what they have been doing on into the future.If you like Star Wars and in partucular this series, I recommend you support their efforts so they are allowed to continue."
5,"Clone Wars, animation like no other!","If you like Star Wars, this is a must! I have been loyally following this show and it has delivered solidly since it started. The story is more compelling every season and they keep raising the bar of animation every time. We watch this show as a family in our house with my 2 daughters and they love it. Highly recommend it!"
5,Season Four,"Season Four of the Clone Wars continues on with the great adventures of Obi Wan, Anakin, Osoka, Darth Maul, Commander Wolffe and all the other great characters."
3,Clone wars,felt like the first 2 stories the writers did not have much to add or was not in the mood
3,My grandson was disappointed this wasn't blu-ray,"Not the seller's fault, I missed it in the description. I'm sure it was fine, but my grandson was very disappointed in my gift this year. He wanted this series in blu ray."
3,This franchise is dead,"I used to love Clone Wars, but its just not the same now. I know this was released before SW was sold to Disney, but it sure seems like these stories are mass produced, quickly written, and not very loved. Too bad."
3,"Meh, it's Clone Wars. What do you expect?","For a series that's gone on way too long. This show has it's ups and downs as for episodes. Star Wars fans go ahead and get it, at least the money I sn't lining Lucas' pockets anymore."
5,best EVER,it was very fun to watch i really enjoyed it it was cheep i really think people should buy this
3,Clone Wars 4,"I am a huge fan of the Clone Wars series, but was really disappointed with its fourth season. We see little of the main characters, and the arc-stories with other characters is distracting. This season does not advance the overall Clone Wars story until the final two episodes. And although the production is stunning, Clone Wars season 4 was personally not one of my favorites."
2,OK for what it is,"Well, you get the whole season but not much else. I had expected that it being Blu-ray, that there would be some nice features but it but it was a little bit of a let down. No actor interviews, or behind the scenes stuff...If you're a Clone Wars fan, you'll probably buy it BUT don't expect a lot out of it."
3,release date,i missed a lot of this season so im excited to pick it up..but why cant they seem to release a previous season..just BEFORE the new one starts up? now i have to dvr season 5 for a month for season 4 to be released....sucks..i dont think clone wars has done that right yet.
3,No Widescreen Format Offered for DVD,I am disappointed that this DVD is not offered in widescreen. Animation does not need blu-ray. Blu-ray players can upconvert DVDs for high definition TV sets.
2,"Stunning, but stunningly disappointing....","If for you the remarkable things about the galapagos include the iguanas, tortoises, and finches, you will be disappointed in this program. After a cursory glance at the earth- and air-borne species, the camera goes underwater and examines fish. The imagery is lovely, but we are NOT seeing those creatures which have made the galapagos famous! A fairer title would have been ""OCEAN ENVIRONMENTS AROUND THE GALAPAGOS AREA.""No quibbles with the glory of the presented creatures, but we had been expecting much more about what makes these islands unique!"
2,"Beautiful images, but tacky, misleading storyline","I agree with the other reviewers that this should be entitled 'Underwater life around the Galapagos'. The movie spends far too much time underwater instead of focusing on the magnificent scenery and wildlife on land. Why can't the IMAX producers simply let the gorgeous images of wildlife speak for themselves instead of dreaming up a tacky storyline about a beautiful marine biologist and her oh so dangerous explorations? At one point she rappels down into a cave and worries about the possibility that the rocks above her will collapse. I was in the Galapagos last month and visited the same cave (on the island of Santa Cruz) - what they don't tell you is that there are stairs into the cave from the other end! The naturalist guides we spoke with in the Galapagos regard the IMAX movie as a joke, all the sadder because members of the IMAX team died making the film."
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed with this movie. The director had an interesting, unique environment he could have pointed his camera toward - the island's vegetation and wildlife are the two things I had hoped to see. Instead the first half of the movie is focused on a woman biologist's bare legs, and the second half is focused on the people and the sub retrieving deep water marine life.Perhaps the film is targeted toward younger audiences which the director feels can't assimilate more than a few species of animals, birds, and fish.For an IMAX feast for the eyes, I recommend Amazon. It's scenic and informative."
3,Mehhh...,"An okay film - beautiful shots of the islands, animals, vegetation, etc. However, that's all that it's good for - the ""story"" is boring, and completely redundant. Unless you're *really* into the islands or something, I suggest another IMAX DVD instead - ""Beavers."" Now, that's a great movie."
2,Sea Bed,Misleading Product as the video had more to do with the life on the sea floor than the Islands themselves.
5,awesome,"this cd is incredible, if you like download ""effetor"" and platEAU, then you will really like this album, phil western is awesome, i highly recommend this CD for any subconscious fans, also look for his song ""sanity shovel"" on the wild planet compilation, it is absolutly amazing, one of the best songs i have ever herd, and look for his song ""touched"" which previously was only available on side 2 of sub001 aDUCK record, you can now get it on the paradigm shift compilation, both compilations are awesome, i cant wait to see what philth and cEvin come out with next. You can also find more phil westerns stuff under names, off and gone, philip western, philth, and capt'n stargazer."
5,i don't even know what to say,"after so many years of listening to the music in my head after losing the real thing to a friend, you miss the intricacy of the picture phil paints. his sense of composition is like a strongly poppy sounding narrative that delivers mood after mood through each song. phil's ability to handle vocal editing and layering of different beats on top of washes of contemplation is most emotive in this release.my favorite tracks are hampi, mourning (which he also released with cevin key in ""music for grass bars"") only longer, sun is round, and getting old. as for the shorter interludes (like ""flashbac,"" transitions) they really add depth to the composition without straying from the structure.some of it is even danceable.excellent work, philth."
2,DO NOT USE IF STUDYING FOR SERIES 7,"Test questions on CD ROM, sometimes the explanation of what was suppose to be the correct answer would not match up with the correct answer as graded. Typo errors throughout book and CD, very annoying. Format of book made for easy reading."
1,This Book is a Joke,The practice tests are so full of blatant errors it makes the book fairly useless. How can you study material if 5% is simply incorrect?
1,don't get this thing whatever you do,This book leaves out so much its a joke. If you're new to this sort of material you'll be in for a rude a wakening when you see subjects on the test not even mentioned in the book.
1,garbage,"This book is horrible, i mean its garbage...seriously get something else...it just confuses me even more, rather get online and read the material."
2,cd rom had errors on it and the text was a little choppy,"I ended up using a computer disk program from american investment training. They are in hauppauge ny. The disk was awesome, it had over 3000 questions and answers with exam taking tips. They also have instructors available to answer any questions that I had. I found them to be very helpful in helping me. I saw their text course too and it looked huge."
2,Meyers Series 7 Needs Update!,"While this book is thorough in its coverage of the Series 7 topics, some of the information in the book is so out of date it would appear that the book hasn't been significantly modified since its original publication in 1988.For example, the financial statement section doesn't include Statement of Cash Flows, there is no mention of the difference in treatment of long and short term capital gains and finally, according to this book shorting against the box is still an accepted trading strategy for individuals!Unfortunately, the text also contains several errors in the end of chapter exams. Sometimes given answers are not among the original choices or are simply incorrect. This problem is not pervasive, however, and does not materially impact the utility of the end of chapter exams.This book may be a nice introduction to the topics covered in the Series 7 exam but I now find myself looking for a more current text to supplement my studies."
1,Not Recommended,"Sloppily written, poorly organized and inaccurate. I'm a quick study and a good test taker, but I was unable to derive meaningful information from many of the chapters. The material was not presented in a way that lent itself to learning and memorization and was instead more or less a regurgitation of facts in no particular order. The programs included on the CD that came with the book did not work correctly. I could answer one or two flash card questions and then the buttons to move forward or backwards stopped working and I had to start over. I contacted the publisher for a replacement CD but never received it. Examples in the text and answers to many of the questions are wrong: 4 * 4000 = 18000 in one case, 24000/14400 = 9600 in another. These inaccuracies are glaringly obvious. What about the ones you don't catch? Unfortunately I already shelled out the money for this book. I'm putting it on the shelf (or in the trash) and buying one of the other books recommended on this site."
4,guitar overkill,"Fred Smith and Wayne Kramer are the best guitar team that rock & roll has ever produced. If you've already worked through the 3 official MC5 records and crave more, pick this up. There's a lot of stuff that you'll only listen to once or twice but we're lucky this stuff exists at all. Like Howard Tate once sang - get it while you can!And check out Mighty High...In Drug City if you like over the top Detroit/NYC R&R;."
5,why don't you own this?,"um, that's it, really. why don't you own this? if you're looking at this, you should already own this. it should already be in your house, your head and your heart. stop reading this. buy this now!"
3,Horror movie,The item arrived on time and in excellent condition. I am a bit disappointed with the outcome of the movie. The plot is bad and the goriness is bit too much that it overshadowed the story of the movie itself.
3,"A bit of this, a bit of that","After finishing this book I thought my time was wasted. Actually I should have guessed from the jacket cover that this would be six sigma forced into the popular (an also lucrative) topic of innovation. The book did indeed trurn out to be just that. Hence, lack of coherence. The only useful part for me was the one on Re-Use, which I thought, was brilliant. This was a very good handling of an often neglected but very important issue. But apart from that the whole book could be squeezed into a little article and all the arguments made here could succinctly be made in only a few pages. If you are after a good book on implementation of innovation, I recommend ""Making Innovation Work"" by Tony Davila et.al. Fast Innovation will not provide answers to most of your questions."
4,"did not mention size, but this is the small size",works fine if you are looking for the small one. don't waste money on cheap brand magnet cleaners. they are junk and you will end up buying a name brand like mag float.
2,Harsh for a mild clean,"This magnet is better suited for glass aquariums that get a lot of algae on the surface of the glass. For day-to-day or average use, the magnet bristles are too harsh and will gladly host any particles floating in the water that will scratch your glass. So be careful, they way to use it is to rinse both surfaces of the cleaner (outside and inside) to make sure there aren't any particles stuck. Then, as you are doing a water change, use a sponge to wipe the inside of the aquarium making sure you eliminate any particles or sand stuck to the glass. Then use the magnet (make sure you pair it only once). If you follow this process you will reduce the chances that you will scratch the glass. I am giving it two stars because for me all these steps are an inconvenience."
3,Freaks out the fish when I use it,"When I use it, the inside brush does this wobbly, lag-like effect.Basically the effect is to create a thrashing effect inside the tank. To remedy this, I don't use the magnetic side and just reach my hand in the water to scrape. Still works, but defeats the purpose of the product."
1,harsh on glass,"This algee cleaner will clean your algee, but scratches the glass really bad, this cleaner will make a mess of your tank"
2,not safe for non-glass aquariums,"I bought 3 new tanks and 3 of these magnents to ease the cleaning of the inside of my acrilic tanks .. but after first use on each tank .. unfortunatly I did not notice until I ruined all 3 .. there are scratches all over and now the new tanks look bad. I am a photographer and was hoping to get some nice shots after everything got going, but after trying to shoot anyway .. the scratches show up bad in the pics. I am researching to find a better way to clean these tanks and wish I had bought glass to begin with .. but the magnets say they do not scratch .. but they do!"
4,Not well finished,The felt pad glued to the external magnet is not applied neatly. It is offset and appears to be sloppy quality control. This does not affect the function at all - works well.
5,The best!,"The Mag Float has been the best magnet based algae scrapper since it first came out. What a brilliant idea: Have the half inside the tank actually FLOAT up to the top of the tank where it can be easily retrieved when the inevitable separation occurs...why no one thought of this before is a mystery. It works great, doesn't look awful, and lasts for a long, long time. It's bigger brothers even have replaceable pads on them(sadly, this little guy does not). All told, if you have algae(who doesn't?),this is your best bet to get rid of it in a hurry :) Highly recommended!"
3,Careful for scratchs,I wreaked my 55 with these magnets becuse i didnt notice tiny iron particals that must have came from the sand got stuck to the mag. at first they worked great from me i plan to buy a new one just giving anyone new to this product the heads up to keep an eye on the magnets make sure their clean!
4,Good,"There have been a lot of reviews about how it scratches your glass if sand gets in it, but the product has warnings. The size is 1"" X 2"", really unexpected but it's good. It says on the back of pack:Clean outside aquarium surface thoroughly before each use.Remove all debris from Mag-Float prior to each use.Do not use Mag-Float above waterline or on dry surface.Keep Mag-Float away from the gravel line and glass aquarium sealant.The magnet part with logo Mag-Float is placed on the outside aquarium surface.Mag-Float can be left attached to aquarium surface.Mag-Float can be used on fresh/saltwater aquariums.Keep Mag-Float away from electronic devices such as computers, pace makers, etc.Manufacturer/Distributor assumes no liability for any damages to your aquarium due to improper use of product.All other reviews that complain have simply been a result of misuse. This is a great product. I recommend it, but please pay attention to the size of this one, 1"" X 2"""
5,The Cross is Central,"Bob Culpepper was my theology professor andmentor when I was in theological school. Hisinfluence continues to this day.This book is a very biblical examination of thecross of the Christ. It is often mentioned inother books on the same subject. Culpepper leavesno stone unturned in his investigation of the Bible'steaching on the death of Christ. The writing isclear and concise, but also has power and depth.I have a friend who has used this book in classeshe teaches on the atonement in a graduate school oftheology. I can't recommend it high enough. WheneverI preach on the atonement I use this book.Dr. Culpepper would want readers to know that hisviews matured over the years after he read John Stott's,_The Cross of Christ_. Both books are rich and willreward any reader who takes the time to work throughthem."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,This toy is NOT fun at all. Believe me I know. If you are thinking about buying this toy for your child please do NOT. He/She will most likely won't like it but this is my opinion but I know that I wasted my money on it. It is really boring!!!!!!!
1,18 weeks...that's it?,I purchased this product back in July right after I had begun training for a marathon. It was very helpful in my training and lasted right up through Marathon day. A few days after the marathon I started running again and when I got outside my watch wouldn't turn on. The watch now only turns on when it's plugged into the computer.
3,Too Small to see,"If you bought this product with the intent of checking your heart rate during exercise sessions (biking, running, & etc.)the display for the heart rate is too small to see. I will be returning it."
5,"superb,enlightening,joyful",I am listening to it now.I put it in it's own cd carousel.A dramatic reading of scripture to lift the spirit in a fifty year format:cd!
3,Compleat Works of Scourby,"Alexander Scourby was NOT British or a dramatist, despite what you may read above! He was a first-generation Greek-American born in Brooklyn in 1913. However, he was a serious Shakespearean actor for a while, and this influenced his professional diction. He didn't always use this standard narrator voice; he was a man of many vocal talents. He was particularly good at doing Russians or vaguely East European types (vide his character in 'The Big Heat'). Personally he seems to have been very devoted to the cause of books for the blind, which led to his first version of the recorded Bible. This edition is a repackaging of his second Bible reading, done in the 1950s."
4,Blues harmonicas,"Lee Oskar harmonicas are very well made and finished off nicely. They have a nice ""bright"" sound and there are no rough edges or corners like Honers. Lee Oskar's are one of the lightest harmonicas on the market and easy to clean or replace the reeds when necessary. For the money they are one of the best harmonicas you can buy."
5,I'VE BEEN CONVERTED!,"I have a variety of different harps (Hohner, Bushman, etc...) and Hohner's Special 20 has always been my favorite. I've got to admit that the Lee Oskar has converted me...I've seen the light! The Special 20 is still a great harp that allows the player a dynamic ability to play clean/clear notes to even dirty/raunchy Chicago blues bendy notes. However, I've got to swallow my pride for the Hohner by saying that the Lee Oskar's got 1up on the Special 20. What I mean by that is, well....you'll just have to find out for yourself by playing one. The sound says it all."
5,Horse & Buggy Print,"A+++ Seller. Thank you for fast & smooth transaction. This print is a memory from childhood when my parents had the giant framed version in our living room for many years. Thanks Again ! Patricia Burton, Calif."
3,Okay,"I bought this on sale, I applied it directly to the brush and it had nice suds but i don't think its any better than a huge cheap jug of car wash available at wal-mart."
1,should have left some of those old rhymes out,"I love the idea for the book, but the author should have been more selective in choosing rhymes that are appropriate for today's children.I was disappointed to find rhymes such as these included: ""Standing at the bar, smoking a cigar. Laughing at the donkey ha-ha-har!"" ""All in, a bottle of gin. All out, a bottle of stout."" and ""Johnny gave me apples, Johnny gave me pears, Johnny gave me fifty cents and kissed me on the stairs. I'd rather scrub the dishes, I'd rather scrub the floor, I'd rather kiss the iceman behind the kitchen door."" Other rhymes include a ""big fat policeman"" who grabs the child and makes him pay a dollar, and a yelling teacher with a great big stick. ""How many times were you fired?"" the child asks the teacher.There are so many fun and positive jump rope rhymes, it's too bad the author includes these and others that are just not appropriate even if they were popular 50 years ago."
4,Good Book!,My daughter enjoyed this book.I do wish it had some color in its illustrations.Fast shipping!!!!!!!
5,Shocking Story,"This is a shocking story of American soldiers sent to a concentration camp. This is a powerful documentary of a little known episode in WWII. The film, however, is not the first to document the story. It actually was inspired by revelations about Berga in Mitchell Bard's 1994 book, Forgotten Victims: The Abandonment of Americans in Hitler's camps."
5,"Wonderful, wonderful noise","Order this album today. One of Ground Zero's better albums. Otomo Yoshihide has a way of making loud, crashing noise that still, for lack of a better term, swings."
2,Not the best sorce for ideas,"This book says it has 18 quilts but what it really has is 6 quilts to make and they show it done in 3 different fabric choices. So 3 X 6 = 18.I did like the quilts they had in there, it just wasn't as many as I was hoping for.The problem is that you can't see inside before purchasing."
3,Waiting For Odysseus,"This book was a lot more informative on the questions that I had about the ladies in Odysseus' life. By reading this book I got a better picture of what Penelope and the others might have looked like, as well as what kind of personalities that they had. Even though I enjoyed the book it was to close to Homer's version of the story, except from a different perspective (and I was a little disapointed in that). I recommend this book to anyone that enjoys reading Greek Mythology, unless you want more of an indepth story about Odysseus' travels."
3,Jessica's review,"I think this book was exactly the same as Odyssey. The only part that was different was how the four women said I, we, me, and my. overall if you like the Odyssey you'll like this book."
2,semi good,I couldn't say I would reccommend this book. Maybe for people who like books with Myth kind of stuff. It's just not a very exciting book. The reading doesn't pick up untill maybe the last two chapters in each book.
1,Cream of the crop,"This book was very interesting........ to say the very least. I don't like stories that are re-written off an old story, much less one that has been re-written so many times. it's like kicking a dead horse. many many many times."
2,BAD!,I am those kind of guy who like to read real life story of people and this is not it. I don't enjoy reading it. I read the first two chapters and I can't continue. the story line just seemed impossible for me.
5,The Book To End All Feminine Books,"This book was fantastic! Usually, you never hear about the women in Greek or Roman mythology, but in this book, the whole story is told through the women's point of view.My favorite was the profile of the story as told by Penelope, because since it was the first, it set the stage for all chapters ahead of this one. She was a lot less quiet in her own words than she is in the Odyssey. The suitors, on the other hand, are bad! Very bad! You don't spend someone's money and try to seduce their wife, unless your sure that the guy is dead!It gets difficult, but it just has to be. This is a great book, in language simple enough to understand, not like the actual book, and pretty much every woman can relate to."
2,Nothing Here,"Not sure what this other dude is talking about - unless you need advice like ""pick a good gun with a high fire rate"" and ""shoot at the same time you are running"". The instruction manual has everything this book does.No cheat codes were discussed, etc. Note the reviews on the previous SOCOM books. They have the same complaints."
2,The Sixties generation 1969,"This CD would be good if the recordings were the original hit recordings. A few of the songs (Backfield in Motion, Sugar Sugar, Tingle Tangle & Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head) are OK, but the rest are disappointing. It would be helpful if the CD disclosed that the songs are not the popular recordings or maybe, these other versions should never be sold."
2,Hated it,"I really didn't like this flick. Poooor story, actually really dumb story, not appropriate for family viewing. Shame the movie industry cannot take a character like Bond and make something interesting, and god forbid intelligent. Brosnan is good but utterly wasted. Special effects are unbelievable. Dumb, dumb, dumb....."
3,Bond Series On The Decline,"While I generally enjoyed the film, I've noticed that the special effects are getting more and more ridiculous in these last few Bond movies. For example, near the end of this film, a car falls out of an airplane. A few moments later, the car is shown sticking up out of the ground is nearly perfect condition, other than the first couple of feet are stuck in the ground. As if falling 5,000 or so feet would cause no damage! The gadgets are cool, and there is a certain amount of ""believability"" to most of the film, but completely unrealistic and nonsensical effects like this one leave a bad taste in my mouth. And they've been getting worse since Pierce Brosnan has taken on the role. Maybe they changed directors/producers/special effects teams at the same time?"
1,Bond really losing its appeal,"Unbelievably bad. Maybe I've become jaded, but has anyone seen a poorer excuse for a plot recently? There's barely enough time between things blowing up and unnecessary ""bullet time"" effects to tell a coherent five minute story. Clearly, the producers of this film do not realize that spending even half as much money and attention on the story would have saved them about $50 million in special effects.What happened to character development? 500 extra explosions is not a substitute for good dialogue, suspense or purposeful action. Even Goldeneye (with a remarkably similar superweapon) had more believable characters. And The Thomas Crown Affair was far sexier with great plot twists and momentum.The lack of chemistry between Brosnan and Berry is stunning. They're both likable actors, but have nothing to work with here. This series is turning into a very long commercial for Jaguar, Aston Martin, Omega watches, etc. Very disappointing from a big Ian Fleming buff."
1,Die Another Day,"DAD is the worst Bond film of all time. I won't go to far into how unoriginal it was, (taking scenes from other Bond movies and putting them together to make one bad movie), but Pierce Brosnan's performance was territble. Now don't get me wrong I like Pierce, but he's just not James Bond. He in no way resembles Ian Flemings character, not the way all of his successors did. It is time for Pierce to step down and hand the role over to somebody like Adrian Paul. Also the movies in general need a lot. James Bond is a Spy not a superhero, he has to stop saving the world all the time and start acting like a Spy. The new movies, which started with Goldeneye, are victimes of too much action not enough suspense. Up until Goldeneye the James Bond series was a Spy Drama, now suddelny its a pointless USA original action Flick. Ian Flemming is probably turning over in his grave watching what has become of his creation."
2,Not up to Bond par.,"Save your money, buy a previous Bond flick. This is one of the worst in the series. Yes, there is action and romance, but it's all somewhat flat overall. The effects are about 10 years substandard. The acting campy."
2,This is NOT Bond,"Geez, Pierce Brosnan makes Roger Moore look like he was a good James Bond.This is nothing more than flashy action with a good-looking babe and Brosnan trying to be something he's not.(This is about the only time you'll see Halle Berry with a white guy with that kind of accent.)Pierce Brosnan is the kind of guy they'd cast in Batman 8... return of the Penguin's mother."
2,oh my goodness,"when i watch a James Bond movie, i want espionage and for stuff to go boom, but i want something thats at least R E M O T L E Y beliveable. this stuff about invisible cars and massive sattelites that grant its weilder godlike powers is just... no. im sorry, but this is a terrible movie. avoid at all costs. now if you are a die hard james bond fan go cry softly into a pillow."
4,"Almost Perfection, but not quite","Having just watched this movie, I have to say it is by far one of the best Bond films made; gritty, realistic and exciting. However, you get the feeling that they are holding back too much with regard to the character of Bond himself, being very careful not to upset fans. The torture sequence at the beginning highlighted a different aspect of Bond which could've made for a very interesting movie had they gone down that route, but instead preferred to pull back to the familiar 007 with gadgets as soon as they could.All in all, a very enjoyable well-made film, but certainly not the best Bond and almost left you wanting slightly more by the end. Well worth watching though - as any 007 film with Brosnan is. Halle Berry was excellent as ever and John Cleese is slowly making the role of 'Q' his own (no easy task)."
2,Brosnan's worst,"This movie had a lot of potential. It started off well enough. It looked as if Bond had finally left the old Soviet Cold War era and entered the 21 century fighting new enemies like North Korea. I loved the idea of having a crazy North Korea Colonel as a villain. Unfortunately, the plot quickly changed a half an hour into the movie and the villain magically became a British man who decided to create a satellite out of diamonds that shot heat rays at things.The dialogue is horrible in this movie. There are so many puns that its almost hard to listen the movie at some points. I do not blame Brosnan or Berry though. Its not their fault that the lines in the movie were so poorly written. Even good actors can look bad when they are working with horrible dialogue. Its sad that this ended up being Brosnan's last Bond movie because it did not do him justice."
1,Is this the end,"After a new element added in the gun barrel opening (cg animated bullet), everything was possible. Lee Tamahori wanted to do the best 007's adventure ever, he just did the worst. Worse than the ones with Roger Moore, and we could even consider 'The World Is Not Enough' to be a Masterpiece. Mediocre special effects, and the most stupid of all gadgets, an invisible Aston Marton. The song is unhearable. Only the fencing sequence is correct. It is in fact a too futurist vision of James Bond, too many explosions, and too many ridiculous sets. What a waste of money ! Poor Ian Fleming, what they done to your creation. Mathieu Vernaison, Lyon, France, 21/11/02."
5,Die Another Day,Lots of Action Good JamesBond movieLoved Madonna !!!!!! she is great in everything she dos Photography and special effects were cool !!!
2,Dissapointing...,"I think this move starts off wonderfully... Then about half way in it just turns into complete absurdity!The cameo by Madonna didn't bug me, but with the extreme sporting billionaire, and that surfing the tidal wave ala Escape From LA... Stuff like that just left me with the feeling that halfway into this film, they had run out of original ideas!I think this one usurps even Moonraker as the lamest of Bond flicks. What a shame!"
5,Bond is Back!,"The 20th film in the James Bond Movies Series is pure fun, and that is what James Bond Movies are all about. Die Another Day plays homage to James Bond. It does everything you would want from Bond and more. 007 movies cross different genres, and this film is more Sci-Fi than any other James Bond Movie. If you are not into Star Wars, then Die Another Day may not be your cup of tea."
4,Best Bond w/Brosnan yet,"I'll keep it short. This is the best Bond that Brosnan has done since he put on the Tuxedo. We see a much darker Bond and it works, there are more layers to James, kudos to Brosnan for showing them to us. Finally, James is growing up a little (not too much though, we want him to be eternally cool).There are some disappointing CGI sequences which take you out of the film a couple of times, and at times the movie drags, but with a Bond movie, you just suspend your disbelief and go along for the ride.Loved Halle Berry and love the trend in the last couple of movies of having some of the Bond Girls kick some butt! I have high hopes for the next one. And for those critics who say Brosnan's age is beginning to show.....the heck with you. I like a rugged and realistic Bond on my screen. Brosnan's got a couple more movies in him!"
3,"There have been worse Bond films, but not by Brosnan.","I enjoyed all three previous Brosnan Bond pictures more than this one. My personal opinion is that Tomorrow Never Dies was his best. Still between that one and this there isn't that much qulaity difference. This film has good special effects, some entertaining sequences, but the plot is a mess, and Halley Berry just isn't a great Bond girl more than being pleasing to look at. Bond fans might want to just skip this one over. It's a rental but not a buy."
5,Great!,"I like how the same person writes the same bad review but gives it a one star one time and a 2 next. *Laughs*This was probably the second best Bond film of the whole series. Sure there were some cheesy parts but EVERY Bond film had them. The Action was great, the story was actually there and well done. The problem is you had to THINK this time and clearly not many like to do that. This put Pierce on the map as one of the best Bonds right behind Sean Connery. Great GREAT movie."
1,Depressing....,"This film lost the sense of ""fun"" and joi d'vie that the classic Bond films had. If you like tense, depressing and cynical then this is your film. If you like some bubbles in your drinks... pass on it."
1,Leave the Director and Screenwriter in North Korea too.,"I bought this movie thinking it'd be another Bond movie; worth watching, cool if you want thrills and classic one liners and innuendo laden names. I thought if it was a Bond movie, it'd rock even if it was mediocre.I was very wrong. Okay, the movie started sort of alright, but it got progressively cheesier and gadgety, and by the time I saw the invisible car and the ice castle (the heck?), I was wondering why the heck I bought this film.Let's face it, this is a Bond film to skip, and there aren't many of those around. For a 20th film, a landmark, this is a horrid, horrid mockery of what made Bond films great. My condolences to whoever invested in this flop.The creative talent in this movie should never work again."
2,Come Again?,"I'm a real Bond fan. Seen every one ever made and have all of them in my collection. I like Brosnan and the Bond Babes. But, yes but. This movie just seemed lame. The bad guys were really bad but not very believable. The special effects were special but not that special. An ice hotel? Dueling super cars? Trans-morphic DNA cloning? Bond getting caught? Give me a break. Never happen. The producers and director seem to be losing the magic formula and trying to make up for it with flash and glitz. I hate to say it but you can skip this one unless you are really bored."
2,Deja Vu,"Evil villian, checkSatelite ray, checkDiamonds, checkGadgets, checkI may be wrong but the overall plot of this movie seems to be the same as Diamonds are forever. Movies started to go downhill after they ran out of fleming books. oh well she is hot."
4,GOOD BUT HARDLY PERFECT !,"It's hard defending some parts of this movie (the cheessy wave sequence; the over blown, MTV-like edited excesive ending; the incompetent Madonna song and cameo), still, beneath this mistakes, lies a pretty good Bond movie. Brosnan and Berry make a great team, Stephens an excelent villain and the Aston Martin-Jaguar chase is truly fantastic.Here's hoping the JB producers realize CGI and popular (but mediocre singing stars) are not what their future is about !"
3,"Good, but too many inconsistancies","Bond a prisoner for over a year? Nope, sorry not going to accept it. Cars 12 feet apart can't hit each other with a plethora of weapons. Oh ya, and they never once suffer a bit of body damage. Given that, Die Another Day has plenty of bond gadgets and girls and all around fun. Not Pierces best bond, but enjoyable for those action movie nights.The movie had a couple instances where it could have ended early, but bond being the licensed assasin he is chooses to not kill his target, but instead chooses to lengthen the movie. Fire the director and try again."
2,One of the worst bonds yet,"Cmon, Does every bond villian have to be a Communist? Its been Soviet Rogues for the past 40 years, Tommorow never dies featured the Chinese.Now,weve got the North Koreans. Bond is not back. Anyone who has seen From Russia with love, or Dr.no, will tell you the same. They have taken the realism to a rock bottom level, Theyve left out all hope for reality. An invisible car? A palace made out of ice? Charecters that appeared from no-where (Diamond-face), A satellite with a mounted Laser. I think this Overpowers MoonRaker in Unrealism,Might as well give bond super powers and a time machine,Thats about all you can do to lower the realism factor"
3,Entertaining but Strangely Hollow,"This movie relies on gadgets and effects to make its impact. But that is fine because that is expected from a Bond movie. The problem is that it comes off hokey.Halle Berry does not act well in this movie. Pierce is Pierce whether he is being interviewed or acting - he is the same person. The Madonna scene and title song are cringe-inducing.The surfing scenes and the invisible car are interesting but there is just nothing to Bond, the man. Casino Royale is a superior movie and should be the benchmark for all future Bond movies. Knowing who Bond the man is far more rewarding than forgettable characters being blown up in seen-it-before effects."
2,I've seen this before,"I thought this movie was better the first time around when it was called ""Diamonds are Forever"". Granted you get some 21st century updates with North Korea and all, but the premise of a satellite with a laser that uses diamonds was done already.It's sad to say, but the writing for Bond has become quite tired, and the writers can't come up with anything totally original."
3,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though Die Another Day suffers from its inclusion of bad CGI effects and a tendency to go all-out preposterous, it does enough things differently and enough things right to make it barely worth a recommendation, especially if you're a Bond aficionado who wants to catch all the references to previous Bond outings."
2,Brosnan's MOONRAKER because it sure ain't THUNDERBALL,"The last and weakest of the Brosnan Bonds. Bad CGI, a lackluster theme by Madonna -- whose cameo isn't long enough for her to do any real damage to the film. The plot in some ways recycles the Goldeneye devise with more power, Tobey Stephens as a billionare who is really a North Korean agent (!), and a waste of the talents of Halle Berry and Michael Madsen."
3,Stupid But Fun (not unlike Adam Sandler),"I know, I know, this one's been out on DVD forever, but I just had no burning desire to see it. We ended up with a copy because somehow Robbie's dad ended up with two copies and the only reason I watched it was because I was testing our DVD player to see if it was messing up on playing all DVDs or just the copies. Anyway, turns out that our DVD player works just fine, and I ended up watching the whole movie. I'm a Pierce Brosnan fan, as you know, so that part was just fine. And it was your standard James Bond fare. Fast cars and faster women, cool toys, sexy villains, etc., etc., etc. I hate to see P. Bros reduced to such horrible scripts, but it was very James Bond-y, so I can't really fault him I guess. Halle Barry was very cute and, oh, there was an ice palace, so that was neat."
1,Worst Bond Movie Ever,"This movie was a complete joke. I am a die hard bond fan. I own all the dvds. I know bond inside and out, but this movie was a real disappointment. The movie has far too many stupid gadgets (come on, an invisible car that fixes itself?) What is with bond surfing? Bond scuba-dives, he DOESN'T surf. There is no real plot, so they had to cover that up with ... explosions. The villans are incredibly stupid, they could have killed bond countless times. And whats the deal with him pulling off the hood of a ice-car thing, attaching it to his feet and then sky-surfing/wave riding? Where did the bindings on the board come from. Save your money bond fans. This movie is pure junk."
5,Looks Like Best Brosnan Movie,"I saw a preview of the movie and of the that, it looks like a very good movie. Not better then Goldfinger of course, (No Bond movie will) but up there. It looks like the best Brosnan movie and better then all of Daltons, Lazenby's one, and most of Moore's. Pierce Brosnan play James Bond very good. Even though I don't like Judi Dench as M. M is better as a man, but still this movie looks VERY VERY VERY good!!!!"
4,"Bond Returns, but will it be good?","After the overly-glossy The World is Not Enough, Pierce Brosnan returns as the suave british secret agent 007 in the newest Bond flick, appropriatly titled Die Another Day. Directed by Lee Tamahori (The Edge, Along came a Spider), Bond no.20 will no doubt be another action-filled entry into the long-running franchise. But will it match the excellent heights of Goldeneye? One hopes so. From what i've seen of the preveiws, the action looks impressive, with explosions aplenty, but as many people in Hollywood have learned the hard way, noisy things exploding and fast action does not a good movie make. But it's a Bond film, and Tamahori has proven to be a director who can do action well, so events should be good..."
1,Dreadful,"Ridiculous effects, ridiculous story, ridiculous dialogue... And Halle Berry can't act to save her life. The fact that the producers wanted to make a spin-off series with her prove they don't know what they're doing! When the studio execs (the ones who axed the Jinx/Halle Berry movie) are the ones with taste and commons sense you know you're in trouble!"
2,GUESS I'LL DIE ANOTHER DAY,"Are they insane? Seriously, this officialy 20th Bond film in the franchise has the worst story since the man with the golden gun. Of course, the movie has some good moments, but the promblem with the film is Pierce Brosnan. He is getting way to old to play 007. Another promblem with the film is the explosions and gadgets.They are just way out of hand. Lee Thamohari who directs this movie has no idea what he was doing. He just doesn't put the James Bond feeling in it. Another thing wrong with it is that the visual effects in this movie are really cheesy. No offence, but James is much meaner than the villians. I hope that the next Bond film, which is going to be the last that will be played by Brosnan is as good as Goldeneye."
1,Ugh!,"This movie really blows, I wanted to leave the theatre half way through but I was with a friend so I couldn't. What have they done to James Bond!?!?"
1,This has to be the worst James Bond film!,"I've watched, and loved James Bond movies for many years now. Hell, I've even read the books by Ian Fleming which are better than the movies that are loosely based on. But this is the worst Bond picture ever made! It has too much computor animation and sci-fi moments. I wouldn't recommened anyone to watch this movie, let alone buy it!"
1,Die Today,"This is the worst movie of 2002, totally crap. If there is one James Bond you should never watch then it is this. As all ways the James Bond movies never have a solid plot everything is routine this is no exception. So this movie really sucks don't bother watching it."
1,Not a Bond movie,I can accept the ridiculous dialog the writers give Halle Berry who apparently has shown she is capable of acting in other motion pictures. I can accept the head-scratching plot. I can even accept Madonna's bad techno-pop theme song.But I can't accept the incredibly horrible blue screen CGI special effects with Bond surfing on the tidal wave near the end. Get this franchise back into the hands of a capable director. Quickly.
2,Die Another Day Not Up To Bond Standards,"This movie did not live up to neither its pre-release billing nor the bar set by previous movies in the Bond Franchise. The plot was very thin (Where did this Killer Death Ray Satellite and the Q-Branch-esque bad-guy's Jag come from?), and the character development was non-existant. Most of the time we at the very least get a briefing on a bad-guy before Bond circumnavigates the world to whack him! The guys at MGM need to spend less on getting big name actors and spend more on the Director and Screen-Play. And one more thing... Bond surfing? PLEASE! My suggestion: Hang-10 to the nearest video peddler and rent a classic (""From Russia With Love"", ""Goldfinger"", ""You Only Live Twice"", heck, even ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" is better!)"
3,More of the same,"Unfortunately, the Bond films have gotten more gimicky and more violent than they ever were. Sean Connery, where are you?"
3,Fun flick,"A bit overlong, and with some absurdly unrealistic effects, this JB flick is still fun to watch. Why do villians let Bond go instead of kiling him?"
5,Very Satisfied Customer,I am very impressed with the quality of my PSP movie and the service is really efficient and professional.
3,Just another Day,"While Pierce Brosnan taking on the role of James Bond inarguably reinvigorated the franchise, in his latest outing as 007 he looks tired, and the film certainly feels like the creative staff agree.There are some high points -- the use of North Korea, Bond in captivity, adventures in Cuba -- but the moment the film shifts to the wintery setting for its last half, it's as though we're watching Roger Moore circa ""Moonraker."" The film becomes cliche, camping and outright silly, and even the ice palace -- clearly meant to be impressive -- just looks like a leftover from a cheap 1970s science fiction movie.While I hope Bond is never fully retired, it feels like it's time to put the franchise on the shelf again for a decade or so, and let a new generation of creators find a way to make him the hero he's meant to be, and so often has been in the past.Recommended only as a rental."
2,I feel Sorry For Pierce Brosnan,"Pierce Brosnan last performance as James Bond will ultimately be described as a joke. This movie is not that bad, but its hard for anyone over nine to take this movie serious. Ice castle? Invisible cars? The endless puns? Madonna as a fencing instructor? Need I say more? The director turned Brosnan's Bond into a cartoon character without Connery's sophistication, Dalton's hard approach, or Moore's humor. Its really sad, but its a hard fact that Brosnan best outing as Bond was his first in ""Goldeneye"". Let's just hope the new Bond (the brilliant actor Daniel Craig) will NOT allow the writers to reduce his Bond into a sad joke."
1,More Hidden Racism,"It's interesting that Halle Berry's character , a government agent , would end up bed with James Bond after a 15-20 second conversation. This is the first time ""Bond"" has gotten a female ally into bed with him so quickly and Halle Berry , the standard of Black beauty , wastes no time jumping in bed with the ""great' James Bond. Hidden racism at it's very best."
1,Instantly forgettable,"DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE...........I felt I wasted my 6 (and the price of cinema tickets to watch celluloid is another review itself)............. How many baddies in this movie !? And the 'plot'..........not exactly easy to follow, if there was one.........where did the satellite come from half way into the film. An invisible car....guess why no one else has used that one before....because it isn't believable. Such loud explosions at the start of the movie too ! Now think about why there is more hype than usual.........Bit like when you see quotes on film posters.......think of some and decide if the film was any good.It is bad enough paying 6 for a cinema ticket these days. How often do you come out of a film these days and say that was good. I have warned you. I would recommend True Lies, Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, Last Boy Scout."
1,Please stop making these movies,If you have seen one James Bond movie you don't have to see them all. It's the same old stuff every time. Cute running around almost naked and can't act to save their life. Boring action scenes and a old and not-so-good-looking James Bond. I mean really PLEASE stop making these movies. They're all the same.
2,homeless 007,"after 007, james bond got captured at north korea, he turns out to be a ""homeless"" when he is released from that dirty place. At the hotel, he cleans himself, shave off the lo---ng beard and cut his hair. After he`s done with it, he looks very cool. But, I didn`t like the actual story."
1,"disappointing, that's the only word for it","This movie's plot seems like it was conceived by the creators of the Bond video games Agent Under Fire and Nightfire. Too many gadgets, too much action, too many explosions, not enough bond. As for Pierce Brosnan, he's a good Bond placed in a bad movie. Not his fault."
2,"Ah, Seuol, it's a wonderful place!","But cancel your trip to that health farm now, as a North Korean interrogation centre is the perfect place to get a healthy diet and those biceps rippling. Even looking like Jerry Garcia from the neck up is not necessarily a downside in some quarters.Rupert Graves boasts the most novel attempt at illegal UK asylum seeking since those guys dressed in that Rhino suit (helpful hint, guys: Rhino's don't talk.) Mr Graves' OTT sword fight with Brosnan is the best thing in this frankly peculiar picture.I saw 'Die Another Day' with my sister's eight year old and smugly lamented the fact that he would not have a clue where North Korea is, let alone any political background to the story. Later that evening during a news broadcast I drew an embarrassing blank when my sister enquired where Yemen was. A certain eight year old's voice chimed in helpfully suggesting that it was in Africa, between something and Egypt. look no further for the next James Bond, Mrs Broccoli."
1,unwatchable,with all of the over the top effects this should have been listed as the next star wars. halle berry is too busy being 'halle berry'. it's too bad because pierce brosnan was a great 'bond'. this was definitely a sign that it was time to change up the franchise and bring it back to an action base without all of the lame invisible cars and friggin' madonna.
1,A horrible movie start to finish!,"This movie, if one can call it that, has an inane story that gets worse through no character development and idiotic dialogue. Could Halle Berry have given a worse performance? (Not that her character helps her any for the afore mentioned reasons). Could they please hire new writers so that they're making good films that attempt to match the quality of the early films. Could they also take some inspiration from Ian Fleming (who I think a lot of people who like this film have never heard of). Get a new director that won't make a video game... also, a new music writer would be good, I know John Barry left big shoes to fill, but they could get someone who's able to write a memorable theme for story and characters (if they had any!) Why not use John Barry while he's still alive? The only thing positive about the Pierce Brosnan films has been the guy who does the title designs... But other than that this film is painful, one star is one too many!"
2,"This is worse than Moonraker, Living Daylights, and Licence to Kill","I rather watch the Moonraker, Living Daylights, and Licence to Kill. At least they are not a bunch of copycats from the previous bond films. Bronsas looks bored with the role and he is just doing it for a paycheck. The bond women in this film were not interesting and not very sexy at all. They were in the line of trying to dominate than anything. The actions is ok, but not great. The locations are excellent, that's what keeps this film interesting. Also, the greatest point and giving it two starts is that Madonna was in the film. I own this on DVD and I don't even hardly watch it. I am glad the Bronsan is retiring as bond, he is getting to old anyway. He was good in Goldeneye and lost interest in the other three."
1,Never Could happen In a Million Years,"The movie sucks from begininng to end.Bond gets from an imposibe scene escape to another, an another,an another.The Girls are Ok and Bronsan looks great, but the writing isabsolutely stupid and moronic.The the scene where the plane is going down, takes like 15 minute, while the girls are playing with swords and Bond is in aeternal fight with the bad boy.Great gadgets for an overproduced ""movie"""
2,Horrible,"Solid action; terrible plot, dialog, and acting (by Hally Berry). This movie proved to me once and for all time that Hally Berry is an god-awful actress. At least Brosnan delivers his shoddy lines with poise - Berry seems almost more comfortable with the throw-away prose.If you are dead-set on buying this movie also pick up a copy of ""Catwomen"" on DVD. Why? Use it to prime yourself for this movie - watch it before hand to set the bar low for Berry and then suddenly this movie will not seem so bad."
3,"Quite a bubble you've got around you, James","The movie is preposterous and playful -- really a perfect Nuevo Bond film. [The best Bond films were realistic, but that trend disappeared. Even the very gritty ""From Russia with Love"", had super-silly scenes (the gypsy girl fight and the boat chase). Those scenes have taken over this movie, but have formed an interesting fantasy bubble of their own: free of plot and as entertaining as a danger carnival.]That said, I have to complain about the use of ""ramps"", MTV-inspired, editor-introduced changes of film speed, as described by the editor in the DVD interview. The ramps reduce a -huge- effort, a crazy car chase on really thin ice, to something that looks like a video game. I thought the scene was computer-generated -- because of the ramps! I'm -so- happy this DVD had a documentary on the making of the ice sequence ... what an effort, and what beautiful filming was ruined by the editor!"
5,Action Pack OO7 Thrill !,For OO7 fans needless to this is a new millenium JAMES BOND thrill. A must to buy. Extra features . Excitement and action all the way. A great addition to your OO7 collection. For a non-OO7 it's worth watching once . Rent it and then make your decision.
4,AWESOME!,"ONE OF THE BEST ""BOND"" FILMS, AND PROBABLY THE BEST OF THE MOST RECENT PRODUCTIONS. VERY IMAGINATIVE MATERIAL. GREAT CAR STUNTS. UNBELIEVABLE CLOSING SCENES. I LIKED IT A LOT. WAS IT THE PERFECT MOVIE ""5""? NO, BUT CLOSE."
4,Bond 20 rules !!!!,"Most can consider Die Another day either the best of Pierce's efforts as Bond or his worst. I say It's his best film as 007 yet. There's a lot of intresting things that James has never been through before like getting caught and imprisoned in a Korean prison, getting some facial hair, an intresting and at the same time classy opening title segment the raises the bar on the previous ones till now, to the refeneces to the last 40 years of bond film history(some you'll noticed right away while others you have to pay attention to). Halle Berry pretty much was the glue that hold the movie together as the american agent Jinx, and man was I surprise to she her being sexy and deadly at the same time. This film should be on any James Bond fan and non-fan's DVD collection and I would recommed that so."
2,the TRL crowd would give this 5 stars,"when its only 2.5 tops.sure,it LOOKS great.the action is non stop,but wheres the plot?this is a prime example of a lousy rock band that depends on pyrotechnics to fool/make the audience forget that they paid to HEAR good music.here,with so much going on and having pent up anticipation for halle barrys entrence made me temporarily forget that there should be a convincing plot to follow.i have long given up on one man defeats thousands since first blood part2.and one would assume that bonds reputation would not allow him to show his face without a disguise EVER.but then again,his nemesis are too busy building the better mouse trap than to recognize a man who thwarts evil doers single handedly over and over and over ..........hey,if master of disguise made money,why shouldnt this?the TRL crowd wont know the difference."
4,Die Another Day,"For the last several 007 adventures, things have been so predictable - the opening action segment then the credits - the meeting with M, the meeting with Q, so on & so forth. Now, theyve juggled things a bit to the betterment of the film. Very good!! But i think they shuold have done better like they should have removed the diamonds in Zao""s face. Its been there for 14 months, right? And the invisible car is too much ! Too impossible! Be more realistic please! i mean we accept that Bond can elude bullets- all the time!- machine gun bullets at that!, but being given gadgets that he curiously needs in the present mission is too contrived !!! But not to discredit the other Bonds i think this is the best Bond after many years, best Bond of Pierce, anyway. better than Goldeneye. To the people behind the camera, the writers specially, reaarange things, be more realistic. Dont be predictable."
2,"Moonraker had better efx,","At least Moonraker used models and slomo explosions caused from a shotgun and the U.S. championship skydiving team to film Bond skydiving with Jaws in panoramic widescreen. Graves popping in with parachute at Buckingham looked over the top and silly in a bond film. I did like the invisible car, but the novelty was ruined when the bad guy #2 had a car to match which could detect it. Most unbelievable is the villain changing his face through ""gene"" technology. What was so wrong about keeping the Korean mad colonel as the main villain? Halle Berry was great in ""Executive Decision"" as a brave but scared stewardess, but she didn't fit as a Bond girl here, not convincingly tough nor sly and seductive. Rosamund Pike hopefully can come back as the main Bond girl like Maud Adams. How about Sean Bean from Goldeneye/Lord of the Rings becoming the next Bond?"
3,This Bond Movie,"is action packed an exciting yet a little gorey.I know you're wondering where's the ROMANCE there is romance my friend and plenty of.For a kid there's a little to much.I know you're probaly saying this is an adult movie though, I'm just warning parents who don't want there kids seeing Pierce and Halle making out or doing worse.A kid I know has already commented on how HOT HALLE is. All in all I would say this movie is FAIR."
2,Let-down DVD,"While this DVD easily sports the highest picture and sound quality of the entire Bond DVD series, it has a few annoying flaws. The first, and most distracting, is that the very powerful DTS audio track is noticeably out of sync with the video for nearly half the movie. I've tested two different DVDs out on three separate home theatre setups, and this flaw showed on them all. The other detraction is the fact that MGM broke the running DVD jacket layout design it had going for the Bond series. Now I have a very nice looking set of 19 Bond DVDs on my bookshelf that is ruined by this DVD. Add these faults to the fact that 'Die Another Day' was the worst Bond made since 'Moonraker', and this DVD is pretty worthless."
2,Desmond Llewelyn is turning in his grave,"For almost 40 years, Q-branch has managed to produce spy toys that pushed the envelope just enough that they could be fun if you didn't get too deconstructive. This movie blasted through the envelope with an invisible car and a holodeck, reducing Bond from a suave, almost believable secret agent to this decade's next sci-fi character.I was skeptical about Halle Berry being a Bond girl, as she is so well established and distractingly beautiful, but she held the movie together.I only hope that Ms. Broccoli is through with her experimentation, will fire her director, [fire] her writers, and continue the tradition of James Bond in a spirit more becoming of the legacy set before her."
2,Don't die another day... do it now!,"This is one of the worst Bond movies I have ever seen. The plot was not all that bad, which is why I give it two stars, but the acting... my God, could it be any worse? I mean, Halle Berry had won an Oscar a year ago: why did she need to take on such a lame role? Sure she's got the looks, and she looks great, but that's about it: the dialogues between her and Brosnan are stuck in the same place of those cheesy ambiguous conversations between the super-agent and former Bond girls, only that it's been 20 movies now, and we're in 2003.There are a few pieces of contemporary action with effects that go in line with today's technology, yes. But what's up with the Robocop suit the villain wears toward the end? Or the Darth Vader-like performance??? All in all, it was a waste of money. You're better off going with some of the earlier Sean Connery Bond movies, if you absolutely must see one of these. Don't die another day, Bond... do it now, please!"
5,The Best,I have seen every Bond movie ever made and would rate Die Another Day as the best Bond movie ever
4,the best bond picture,die another day was perice bronsan best paerformance as bond the action secences were good the womans are hot my two favortine scenes are when bond is surfing to norh korea my when zao using heat thermali to find the aston martin it worth the rent the movie and enjoyed.
3,Better Than Some...,"As a long-time Bond fan,I like all the Bond films(some more than others). DIE ANOTHER DAY was pretty good but the more I think about it,DAD seems to me just a up-dated version of DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. A few things that got on my nerves was all the sexual innuendoes in the dialogue,the really bad CGI work on the para-sail escape scene and all the product placement through out the movie. The movie was slick,action-packed,sexy and kinda funny in some parts but it could have been better.The DVD set is good and loaded with alot of extras so if you liked the movie be sure to buy the DVD set. Looking forward to Bond21."
2,WHAT THE HECK!?!?!?,"OK THIS MOVIE HAS SOME GOOD PARTS, LIKE THE LAST 30 MIN, BUT BESIDES THAT IT IS SO BORING. BOND SOMEHOW CAN DO EVERYTHING THE BEST. HE DIGS A HOLE IN THE ICE AND SWIMS UNDER THE ICE, THEN APPEARS IN THE JUNGLE?!?!?!! WHAT THE. BOND SEEMS TO KNOW WHERE EVERY LITTLE SERCRET IS TO THE BAD GUYS HIDE OUT, HES NOT CHALLENGED AT ALL. THE ONLY THING GOOD IS THE MUSIC AND THE LAST 30 MIN. PLUS SOME S.E. ARE AMAZING AND SOME OTHERS ARE PLAIN PETHETIC"
3,A little disappointed.........,A little disappointed.........in this JB movie.But worth seeing if your a fan.I didn't like the scenero of James being a POW.I mean after all isn't he our best secret agent?And secret agents are not supposed to get caught.I felt Halley was in it for her looks.She really didn't have much to do but look good.But if you collect JB DVD's I suppose you should have this one.
1,You can't beat the old Bond,"It use to be enjoyable to see a James Bond movie. I grew up with ""Dr. No"" ""From Russia with Love"" and of course ""Goldfinger"". They weren't just enjoyable but they were believeable at the same time. But something happened and not for the better. These new Bond movies are put together without much thought of acting and content plus with each passing movie the special effects become more and more outragious. In plain english,,,,this movie [is bad]. Save your money and rent the old James Bond classics."
1,Bond is officially dead,This was a bad movie. Think about the older films... gadgets are there for those sticky situations - a bail out... this movie uses them the WHOLE TIME. The stunts and trickery have gone so far overboard that it's a comedy now. Brosnan could not save this film either. He should jump ship now before he gets into another bad one. The whole premise was so far flung it made me crack up laughing. Bond is not superhuman and neither is the film series... not anymore anyway.
1,Worst Bond Movie ever,"Easily the worst Bond movie Ever. After watching 'Tomorrow Never Dies', I stopped watching Bond movies. Saw parts of this movie.Please bring back the cold hearted version of Bond potrayed in Dr. No. Please bring back the sophistication of Sean Connery. Bring back the humor of Roger Moore.I wan't some degree of realism in a Bond movie. I don't want to watch a cartoon. All Bond movies since ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" simply seem to be a sequence of action scenes and nothing else."
2,A little on th bad side.,"It's been awile sence I saw a James Bond film. So I decied to see this and it was a little on the bad side. Why? Where are some resons,1: of corse, the villoin is some Carien guy. Why is it always some Carien guy? And the idea that he gets into the body of some Engalend guy was stuip( my big qution is HOW did he get into the england guys body?). 2: What was Halle Berry doing in this film?I know there sapose to be ""Betiful"" Bond girls but come on! 3: Needed a better ending, period. 4: The sricpit was rushed throw, alot.Bond fans and people who want to see some action will like this but the bad writting and casting put this movie a little on the bad side."
1,Serious Move? Comedy? What?,"I bought this movie because I wanted a video of Rosamund Pike. Even this delightfully attractive young woman can not save this movie.I would venture to guess this is one of the many reasons why Sean Connerey abandoned the role of James Bond. The producers always presented 007 as a cavalier, happy go lucky, knight and got caught up in so many unrealistic special effects that the story line was lost.This was one of the worst.The best Bond is the new one. Daniel Craig.The old Bond peaked with Thunderball and it's all been downhill since then.But...Rosamund Pike is drop dead georgeous!"
4,Probably One of the Best James Bond,"I was really impressed when I first saw this movie. When I heard about it, I thought it was going to be another boring James Bond movie, with the same repeating action and some of the same lines used by Bond from other movies. Anyways, this was a pretty good movie with many new gadgets including a camoflauge car, a giant satelite that transfers heat from the sun's rays onto Earth, and armored hover crafts...could it get any better?See this movie for yourself."
2,Time to put James Bond to rest???,"Well, at least this one was better than the abysmally bad ""The World is Not Enough!"" But the Madonna theme song has to be the worst ever. And Halle Barry as an armed agent?? Well, not quite as far-fetched as Denise Richards being a nuclear physicist, but still......Goldeneye was decent and Tomorrow Never Dies was okay as well, but the James Bond series should die a natural death. There's no point in continuing with them, since they clearly can't make them like they used to."
2,"Over the top, but unsatisfying","I realize it's like saying you didn't have fun at Mardi Gras, but I didn't enjoy this movie. At times, I found myself getting bored during the stunt-a-thons, wondering when they were going to turn down the noise a little.I never ""bonded"" with the heroine Jinx, and wondered why Bond would even want to go back to the Ice Palace to save her. Guess it's so he could drive his invisible, bullet-proof car in a chase scene with the bad guy. I found Miranda Frost far more intriguing, but alas...The usual ""talk dirty to me"" repartee' is reduced to sophomoric, expecially in the diamonds-in-the-naval scene. This movie is more about technology, stunts, and cliche's than the Bond characters that keep us coming back after 20 films."
2,Not the Exit that Brosnan Deserved...,"There are Bond films that tend to divide the fans as to their qualities (""OHMSS,"" for example, or even ""Moonraker""), and then there are the Bond films like this one that are just tough to defend. Ugh. This entry starts promisingly enough - Bond is taken prisoner and foresworn by MI6 - so that one could be momentarily forgiven for believing it might be more emotionally charged and character-driven than its predecessors. But when Madonna's misplaced theme-song kicks in, followed by the laser beams and ice palace, hope falters. And then the bloody invisible car shows up. A little camp is not necessarily a bad thing (see the genuinely fun ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" for reference), but this picture presents excess at the expense of the franchise. Brosnan may not be my favorite Bond, but he deserved a better exit than this."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered the product which was pictured here, because I wanted to add to my Son's collection. The DVD I received was a different cover. I ordered again, only to receive the wrong one again. I have now ordered a third time, and really hope that this will be the correct one as Christmas is near and I really wanted to help him complete the collection he started. The one pictured here is the correct one. If there is any way that Amazon can make this correction, I would appreciate it. How can I specify to Amazon that I want only the one pictured and not a substitute? I have ordered many other books and DVD's fromAmazon and have always been entirely satisfied."
4,Die Another Day,"Greatings fellow Bond lovers. I really enjoyed watching this film, but I will have to say that ever since Q passed away, Bond films have and will never be as good. Q really made Bond films what there were.Die Another Day had a very good plot with great acting. However, over the years, Bond girls have been getting too ""sexy"". I feel that this takes away from the film. Over all, this film was action packed and kept you on the edge of your seat. The car chase was very well done but the surf boarding was very poor. You could tell that it was done on a computer. Q could have done a better job! More over, I gave this film 4 stars. Well put together except for the surfboard shots. Trully a must have for the collector and Bond lover.Rest in peace Q. We all love and miss you. You were the best!"
2,"Good action film, bad Bond movie.","If you watch this I recommend not applying anything you know about Bond films. Throw it all out, ignore it. The film is good for modern day, but lacks the feeling that something like Bourne Identity gives, true espionage! The days of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, From Russia with Love, Goldfinger, etc are gone and will never return. High tech special effects and sci-fi gagetry are the norm for the new Bond films but that is what sells for the masses. The story is lacking and beyond believablity. Past Bond films were way out there too but still had a small amount of reality to them - with the exception of Moonraker.Its a good action movie and the homage it plays to all the previous films is fun to catch hidden through out the film. But still lacks the true feel of international espionage. As the cold war ended so did the good Bond films."
3,its all good up to a point,"Die Another Day was a decent Bond flick until they had to nearly ruin it with the Icarus satellite plot device. its basically a rehash of Diamonds are Forever. i take it that the Bond Writers are running out of ideas. they should stick to the roots of For Your Eyes Only and From Russia With Love which concentrates more on plot and characters than special effects and gadgets. but overall i loved the tributes to the old films (although a bit too much)and finally we get to see Bond in a Compromised position since License to Kill especially when he got captured and locked up in a North Korean prison cell for over a year while being routinely tourtured and drugged (possibly even used as a Programmed Assassin, its in the movie!)lastly, we need a good actor to play a Bond Villan (Gary Oldman or Anthony Hopkins in mind?)."
3,Bond can never die,"its a notch better then Tomorrow NEver Dies non the less and I liked it throughout and its fun, purely fun and for Bond fans. ok, lets say if Sean Connery played Bond for all 20 films, like Bond would be like the same age as Connery. good concept and it would be funny to of seen that happen. anyway, at the beginning of this one Bond gets captured and tortured and then he is traded with some dude that has diamonds stuck up into his face. Bond meets Jinx(Halle Berry, wow!!!) and they team up to go aginast the evil Toby Stephens and his woman Rosamund Pike(wow also!!!). Judi Dench and John Cleese reprise their roles as well as M and Cleese went from R to Q because Desmond Llwellyn the old Q died after making The World Is Not Enough(and I liked the old Q too). Madonna does the cover song and also has a cameo as well. the ice palace at the end is grand, though who would wanna live in that place."
5,The best 007-Movie ever,"This movie is without any question the best 007-Movie I've ever seen. And I also think Pierce Brosnan is so good as Sean Connery, the first Bond.+++ REALY GREAT WORK +++ ;-)"
4,GrEaT MoViE A LiTtLe oN ThE BoRiNg SiDe LoL (laugh out loud),"Die Another Day was and exiting action packed thriller that threw u off track again and again. It is, obviously, about James Bond. This time he needs to kill a man with dimonds studded in to his face from and explosion. He is in much deeper water, literaly, than he bargained for."
1,Shockingly bad movie (Halle Balle please SIT DOWN!),"I have been a fan of James Bond movies ever since Dr No. I think Pierce Brosnan is a great James Bond, but just what in tarnation was he thinking taking on this pile of celluloid excrement ? Halle Berry, YOU CAN'T ACT. I don't care that you got an oscar you are terrible ! and you ruin this movie. You look nice as dressing for the movie but don't try and out do bond!!!! I cannot believe they are even thinking of a spinoff with this appalling Jinx character. PLEASE AVOID THIS MOVIE..."
1,Copycat Movie,"This movie is just copying from the original Bond Movies.#1.Jinks rising out of the water in a bikini (Dr.No)#2.The Fight in the plane (Goldfinger,The Living Daylights)#3 Bond quitting the MI6 and becoming a rogue agent (License To Kill)They Even Copy a line from Goldfinger!""You Must Be Joking, I Never joke about My work"
3,Die Another Day,"As a true Bond fan (yes, I even liked Timothy Dalton in the role), take it from me, the potential of this movie far outweighs its final mediocre version. When it comes to action movies, this is top-notch, but us Bond-aficionados have come to expect the best. The best, however, was not delivered this time.Die Another Day will forever be similar to Diamonds Are Forever- a few great moments, but ultimately forgettable."
2,"Looks and Sounds better, BUT..........","The second DVD of ""Special Features"" doesn't have near as much as the regular release on DVD. The packaging says this DVD has the ""Ministry of Propaganda"" with original trailers, TV Spots, and Radio Communications.NEWS FLASH: IT DOESN'T !!!How annoying !"
2,The movie dies another day,"James Bond's last pre-Daniel Craig adventure is long on the campy,short on everything else. Pierce Brosnan is able to drop witticisms (as well as trou for the lovely ladies) &have; amazing machines as the villain (Toby Stephens) plans to ice up the world. Halle Berry's character is a shallow Mary-Sue. She's got uber-special 1337 powers,able to match wits with 007, and she exists to be beautiful&enjoy; amazing intimacy with the superspy. There's also Emma Frost--who's icily virginal&isn;'t inclined to yield to any man (except perhaps her creepy brother),but she melts as well in the ludicrous ice palace. Talented actors like Judi Dench,John Cleese&Sean; Bean are left on the sidelines. There's the consolation of a campy Madonna theme song.""Die Another Day"" is one of the weaker Bond films. It piles one ludicrous premise onto another,and the ending is anti-climactic (though not for Bond&his; ladylove) It's worth missing. A better bet is ""Casino Royale."""
2,Too Far Over the Top,"The film would have made a better spoof then trying to come off as a serious Bond flick.From the opening scence where we have Bond and a couple associates ride a monster wave to the car chase on a sheet of ice it is all too much. I would love to purchase a vehicle that does not sopin out on pure ice. Where can I get one? Note how Bond gets wet several times in teh film, yet his hair is always perfect.I agree with another review on this page, the scene of Bond parasailing on a big wave is a joke and an embarrassment to Bond fans.Halie Berry is as bad as it gets. Even though she looks good she is such a poor actress I can't enjoy watching her. Perhaps if she just kept her month shut it would work for me.A big disappointment that Bond did not bed Madonna. There is just something about her that makes it work for me."
4,SURPRISINGLY GOOD,"This was the first Bond movie I hadn't seen on the big screen (since watching Roger Moore as The Spy Who Loved Me back in the 70s). I'd been disenchanted by the last two Bond outings: Tomorrow Never Dies and The World is Not Enough...Pierce B was better than Tim Dalton but the scripts and direction were incredibly weak in previous films. Not to mention boring bad guys.Die Another Day is a return to form. If it's going to be Brosnan's last turn as Bond, I'll miss him. Great script, big sets, riveting action and good direction from Lee Tamahori. This is the most interesting Bond film since Goldeneye.Worth watching and I haven't even seen the extras yet..."
2,they're gettting worse and worse,"Not only does ""Die Another Day"" have the worst Bond theme, it also has the worst Bond girl. The plot of the movie is the same as any other, villians want to take over the world, blah blah, etc. And of course James Bond comes to the rescue once again, this time with a score to settle with the North Koreans. Basically the same plot as any other spy movie. The gadgets in James Bond have been getting completely out of hand. An invisible car? I mean, c'mon. What next, a cyborg that James Bond commands that will do all his dirty work? This is probably one of the worst Bond movies ever. Whatever you do, if you are a newcomer to James Bond, please do not judge the series by this junk! Start with Goldfinger and move your way up. Or better yet, skip this film completely."
3,"Fun, but...","The 20th James Bond film not only marks the 40th anniversary series but also shows a sometimes desperate effort to make the franchise as contemporary as possible. The gadgets go way too far at times, making this seem like a comic book movie. Don't get me wrong; I love comic book heroes and comic book movies. Still, it somehow bothered me to see Bond going so far in that direction. It's a fun movie, and I enjoyed it, but the invisible car and such distracted me even more than the overly obvious product placement.I recently read that a current internet campaign involves pushing Adrian Paul (the TV incarnation of The Highlander) as the next Bond. That sounds good, but I'm glad Pierce Brosnan agreed to at least one more Bond film beyond this one. Brosnan plays the role with the required wit and style, along with a little vulnerability. I also hope Halle Berry will reprise her role as Jinx."
3,"Decent movie, great soundtrack","Okay, I went to see Die Another Day the first weekend it came out. The story was decent and the characters were great. I especially loved Miranda Frost's part. She exuded sexuality and a kick [butt] mentality. Halle Berry as Jinx was a waste of time. She didn't contribute much to the movie but to look beautiful (as always). I think you have to be a very strong actress to pull off a James Bond Girl and Halle doesn't fit that mode. I hope she doesn't get her own spin off from the movie, as it will be a flop unless she plans to go nude as she did in Monster's Ball. Anyway, Madonna's contribution to the movie was well received. The small part she played and her song Die Another Day is a major hit and went appropriately with the movie. Not the best best James Bond but not the worst."
3,Bond is back,He's back but not better than ever this bong film is not like the bond films but i liked the movie any way i just wished it could of been more like the old bond films
1,The worst Bond film ever!!!,"This is without a doubt the worst Bond film ever made. Even without mentioning the cheasy Madonna-Product tie in, the story is just weak, and the inconsistancies in Bond's character are unforgivable. (Bond would NEVER walk through a 5 star hotel lobby with his shirt open during the evening!) As a lifelong fan of the series, I'm afraid 007's finally run out of steam."
1,Worst Bond Movie Ever,"This is the worst movie of 2002, totally crap. Gave it one star because there's no lower rating!If there is one James Bond you should never watch then it is this. Invisible cars? Stupid plot!Instead of story writers Holywood started employing software companies to make the movies for them. Looks like a video game.Pierce Brosnan is probably the ONLY good thing that happened to this movie. No doubt - the worst Bond movie ever!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Who is paying these people?,"Who is paying these people to write this stuff. This was the dumbest, poorest and cheapest looking Bond ever. Ian Flemming is roling over in his grave right now. The computer graphics are the worst and the rest is just all poor. I'm a real James Bond fan and this isn't a James Bond quality movie by any means."
2,Hmmm...,"Definitely not the best James Bond movie ever made. Pretty, and entertaining... but just not my favorite by any means."
1,This is not steelbook how show,"No Steelbook how showI am very sad for this is not steelbook, all movies from James Bomd are excellent."
2,Long and Boring,"This movie just about put me to sleep. In my opinion, the script, and the acting was bad, it was too long. Several times I thought the movie was over and the next thing you know, we're onto another scene. This 007 movie is a disgrace to the series. I won't recommend seeing it in the theater, don't waste your money."
2,The most ridiculous film ever made,"Die Another Day is, put simply, ridiculous. This is a Bond film that is so cliched and cringeworthy that it borders on looking like a parody. This film seems like all the Bond films rolled into one - which might not seem a bad thing - but every line, action sequence, or plot development seems to be stolen from another Bond film.I suppose this film was at first somewhat entertaining and fun to watch, even if it was at times so cheesy you wanted to cover your eyes, but by the 80 minute mark I just wanted it to end. The extent to which Bond manages to survive anything is so stupid that you can only laugh.I do wonder whether the self-parody is deliberate - either way, there were so many lines of action/hero/sexual cringeworthiness it was unbearable. Whilst parts of the film were enjoyable, it is poor as a film."
2,Hows this 007 flick get Blu-Ray before Goldeneye?,This ones not the worst but theres better... Goldeneye. (I like his P99 on the cover... I have the same)
2,For people curious about the BLURAY version,"First off I had to do a firmware upgrade just to play the movie.Two stars given because the movie is so good.I would give it one for the bluray disc.There isnt one scene minus the opening titles that stands out clearity.I had high hopes for this bluray.MGM usually has a fantastic bluray disc. Just look at ""FROM HELL"".This IS NOT a crystal clear picture.This looks as good as any other dvd copy.There is black static throughout. You can notice it in the background. Its the actual copy of the film. This wasnt remastered for bluray.I am a huge supporter of blu but when a movie comes out and its a waste of your money I will review, I.E. The Italian Job remake. HORRIBLE.Like I said. No need to spend money on this double dip. It is not a crystal clear version."
1,Definitely the worst Bond flick since Moonraker,"Possibly even worst than Moonraker. I have all of the Bond films and am a big fan, but this film is a sell out to hype and marketing and has very few redeaming qualities.It is just plain poor."
2,Live and Let Die,"Roger Moore Rules, he's the best 007 out of all of them. The worst being Timothy Dalton, what a loser."
3,Kinda funny,"Jamie Kennedy is alright. Sometimes his skits are funny, but sometimes.... If you ever watch the skit called ""Child Island"" you will discover something funny and yet alarming about parents these days."
2,Not suitable for large eggs,"Product is non-stick as long as you use butter or some oil. Small enough to fit into a large pot, no wide saute pan needed. However, the cups are quite shallow. A single large egg completely overflows the cup by several tablespoons of egg white. The overflow runs off into the water creating needless waste and an extra mess."
3,it's ok...,"i've never used an egg poacher before so i really can't compare it to other products. but as a first time user i found it satisfactory. a few things made it less than perfect. however for the price, it's pretty much what i expected. The biggest problem was that it must have been slightly bent during shipping because the tray was slightly warped, including the small legs which were also kind of bent. so one side was submerged in water while the other side was not."
5,"I might seem too mature for this stuff, BUT IT ROCKS!","OK, I might seem too mature for it, but MEDABOTS IS THE COOLEST SHOW EVER!(Yu-Gi-Oh season doesn't start til Fall...)"
1,omg,I cant believe you people give this a good rating. It sucks so bad it gives anime a bad name. If you like this show may god help you!
5,Best album among their first 3 albums!,"I own all three of their albums. This is the most catchy, dark, heavy, soulful one. All the songs are well known enough. Don't need to explain much. This is what bluegrass should sound like in the 21st century!"
5,The coolest music I've heard in a long time,I discovered the latest Crooked Still album by pure chance in Charleston SC... This is great music and O'Donovan's voice gives chills.
1,Right packaging and CD cover - wrong audio,"Two attempts now - both CD's are actually Redd Foxx! Both the CD holder and the CD itself have the correct ""Shaken by a Low Sound"" picture, but the audio is from an old live Redd Foxx performance (no joke)."
4,Unique Design & Great Quality,This particular silver necklace nicely compliments my other jewelry treasures...such as my pendant and locket. The necklace arrived with lovely gift packaging. I would definitely shop with this company again.
4,Excellent if you're willing to spend a few extra bucks,"When I first saw this on the shelf at my local Borders I almost laughed. Who'd pay fifteen bucks for yet another NFL Preview book when there are several out there on the magazine racks for half the price? After taking a look inside however, I was tempted to buy it myself! Aside from the greater overall quality of the book compared to the magazines, the best feature is the humor. I laughed out loud several times in just a few minutes while skimming over the previews. Speaking of the previews, they are extremely well-written and are very relevant. I'm stunned this was written by one person."
1,Don't waste your $,"This album was a HUGE disappointment. It sounds like some guy ""recorded"" it on his computer in the back using midi files and some inexpensive software. This wouldn't be a party I'd want to attend..."
4,Generally excellent,"Doesn't quite merit a five as there are a few filler tracks, but I wouldn't hesistate in recommending it to anyone, as some of the tracks are outstanding. ""Cup of Tea"", ""Reverend Girl"" and the awesome ""Myself"", as well as the better-known ""The Freshmen"" are flagship tracks, but there are plenty more besides. This album is a grower - upon the first few plays, only a few songs stand out, but subsequent listens start to etch the less immediate songs into your subconscious, and they stay there. I give hardly any albums a five; this is an excellent effort."
3,Their best effort,"Villians is the Verve Pipe's best effort and represents the band's peak both musically and creatively. Standout tracks include ""The Freshmen,"" ""Penny is Poison,"" ""Revernd Girl"" and ""Cup of Tea."" Overall, the album is worthwhile and mostly enjoyable, but don't bother with the self-titled album that came after this one."
3,Not as Good as the First Two Albums,"This disk is a real let down. I think the groups first two albums are great modern pop records. However, the boys rehash a great song (The Freshman) on this disk that had already been released on their first album. After hearing this disk, I began to wonder if they had any good NEW music in them."
2,I wonder if there's a connection between this group and The Verve?,"If there is I can understand why I really don't like this. It tries to sound like King's X, and I use the word tries. Most of the material is lame, and I wouldn't want to listen to it all the way through. Only 3 songs were good here. ""Drive You Mild"", ""Penny Is Poison"", and ""Cattle"". The weakest song on here was ""Cup Of Tea"" I feel that a big improvement would be if ""Weird Al"" Yankovic would do a parody of that song, and title it ""Chicken Of The Sea""(in honor of tuna). The rest of this album I have no use for, and say that I'm in a generous mood tonight giving it 2 stars. I know that about a year after I first heard ""Cup Of Tea"" I heard of the group The Verve, and their loser of a hit ""Bittersweet Symphony"". I thought it was the same group only switching gears, and trying to become more pop than alternative. I would like to know if these 2 groups co-exist, or if they're both different. Anyone out there please fill me in."
2,SPEND MONEY ON SOMETHING BETTER,"I loved THE FRESHMAN and PHOTOGHRAPH, but the rest of the songs are boring and out of date. My advice to you is to buy another CD. This one is not worth it."
4,"Great band, good album, they will get better.","Villains has moments of brilliance, but i'm affraid does not fulfill The Verve Pipe's potential. The Freshman is at best a good song, it is one of this band's first songs, written for their debut, self launched album in 1992. (Villains is their third album, first by RCA). They have come a long way since then and if you know these guys, they will get better every album they record. If your unsure about The Verve Pipe, go see them live, they are great entertainers with trumendous talent behind every instrument.Musicians that are true artists are rare these days. The Verve Pipe are truley talented artists."
5,Probably the greatest overall release in 1996,"The Verve Pipe, who had already released 2 albums that weren't very successful, finally broke though with this album that has to be one of if not the best album of 1996. From track 1 til 13 every song can hit any one hard weather a hard rock fan or an alternative fan. Ones that stand out are Cup Of Tea, The Freshmen, Photograph, and Cattle. The only song that comes short of absoulute brilliance are Penny Is Poison which is also an excellent track. Even the less than 2 minute long track, Real, is awesome. If this band can make a follow up album anywhere near as good as this, they will have a very bright future ahead of them. Villains is more than promosing material, it's the kind of stuff that is usually the best a great band will release, and it's all on one album, not even a greatest hits. The Verve Pipe are definately for real."
1,Wiff,"Wow, I haven't been this disappointed in an album in a long time. Granted the song ""The Freshman"" is a timeless classic, but the rest of the album is far from it's greatness. The album lacks melody and is infested with poor song writing. If you like ""The Freshman"" buy the single, stay clear of ""Villains""."
1,Yuck,I don't like this album AT ALL - it was a huge disappointment for me. The only good songs are Freshmen and Photograph...the rest is just lyrics that make no sense and music that doesn't fit them
2,Over rated.,"Whats with every band getting 4 stars or higher. Is it just a ploy to get us to buy the cd's or is it that just the people who love the cd's review them. I tried to think of a band that I, nor anyone else that I've come across, have liked. The Verve Pipe is it. 4 starts? Come on. These guys are really bad!"
5,metaphors set to music,"Everyone will have, or should have heard ""the freshman"", but the other songs on this album are just as good, if not better. Each songs seems to tell a story, even though you might have to look a little deep into the lyrics and yourself to find it. But if you are not into that, and you should be, the music just plain rocks. You get a chance to shout a long, with tracks like ""barely (if at all) and ""cup of tea"", and then a chance to listen to the smooth poetry that is the voice of Brian Vander Ark on ""penny is poison"" and ""veneer"". Each song is brilliant in its own way, and this album is fun, serious, and definitely worth buying."
3,"It's not bad, but not great","It's ok, but if you just like ""freshmen"" you will be better off buying the single."
4,Inexpensive colon cleanser,"With so many high price colon cleanser in the market, senna leaves are an efficient product that works well overnight and does the same effect of other supplements in the market at a fraction of the price."
4,"Luke Short Rides Again, and Well","One of Luke Short's vigorous morality tales with the protagonist working to un-do his shady dealings of the past, and the strong woman who loves him for it. In this he was cheating ranchers while buying mounts for the Cavalry, which his town girlfriend thought clever, but appalled the ranch woman.Reading a Western history it spoke of the terrible person Luke Short was, and I took a deep breath, then later learned the author's real name, Frederick Dilley, Glidden, he who attended college and worked in archeology.)"
3,Funky pop-punkish... something,"Pretty good stuff. At first I was just turned off from these guys. Music was pretty simple, vocals not that great, similar sounds to all the songs. ""My Alibi"" and ""If I Could Only ""are the best songs. The more I forced myself to listen, it's so querky it kind of grows on you. Amazon had their CD used for like 1 cent... it's worth a purchase to throw on the player when you're in that funky mood where you don't care if the music is a bit immature and you just want to rock out... Enjoy...."
5,Come Back,"I do a radio program(public radio KRBD) here in this little town called Ketchikan, Alaska. I feature Greg Brown's music often. I think I own every cd that he has put out and must say this one will be my favorite. Greg has played here a couple of times to a packed house.People here can relate big time to Greg's songs. Greg please come back and let me take you fishing in an Alaskan stream. I'll pack us lunch...Ray"
5,Greg Brown's best,"Of all Greg's CDs that I own, this one is my absolute favorite. Every song is great!"
2,"Fair, Not Worth the Price","I ordered the queen size 4"" mattress pad and it came in a very small-tight box and was crushed to the extent that I did not expect it would expand back out... But over about five days wiht some stretching help and some rubbing of the surfaces, it expanded to its full size. It is not as firm or solid as it should be, especially for the price. We had purchased a different 4"" queen size pad for two-thirds the price and it is better than this one. Just not the quality they say it is and certainly not medical quality."
2,Didn't meet my expectations,"When I received the eggcrate overlay I took it out of the box and left in my guess room to decompress. I gave it two weeks. It still had some ""wrinkly spots"", so I waited another week. At this time I decided that it probably wouldn't get any better. It's bit short for the bed in both the length and width. The ""wrinkly spots"" show through my bedspread. I have problems with my left hip and I was hoping this would alleviate some of the pain I experience only at night. Unfortunately, it didn't make a difference. I will probably cut this up in smaller beds for my cats."
3,Not bad... but the size is not big enough,"Pros: makes my once, sleeping on the road its so hard bed actually somewhat comforttable.Cons: I noticed a lot of people mentioned it never fit or adjusted to the size of my queen bed, and after 2 weeks it still hasn't."
1,good if you are missing your left arm,"the songs barely sounded like the ones they claimed to be. apparently they think we only have one arm since they only put the notes the right arm is doing. its very disappointing. now if you really did only have a right arm, then thats fine, this is the book for you. if you have 2 functional arms then this is annoying. the left arm needs to be trained just as much as the right arm, no sense in only using the right for an entire song"
4,"Complex, relentless, highly recommended.","With its Kenny G-ish saxophone and straightforward diva vocals, the first track, Universal Love, sounds like a bid for Top 40 airplay (I have to admit it's pretty catchy, though). After that, it's pure breakbeat science: imaginative, layered, time-stretched pulses that go in and out, backwards and forwards in elaborate, relentless sonic landscapes. The latter tracks, as a unit, could be a kind of sci-fi concept album, with titles, spoken word samples, and sounds devoted to Martian colonization, solar radiation, ""wrinkles in time,"" and other extraterrestrial concepts. More on the listening than the dancing end of the drum-and-bass spectrum, this CD is amazing technically, but has enough melody and feeling to make the science seem wildly romantic, rather than geeky."
2,Disappointing,"Sadly I can't recommend this album. I bought it based on the rave reviews here and the exerpts, which sounded intriguing. The problem here, as with much drum n bass, is the total lack of melodic content. 4 Hero do serve up some fine drum machine rhythms, but not much else. Their idea of melody is a few swooshy synth chords, a technique they return to again and again. You get vocal snippets here and there, but nothing substantial. What's really odd is the lack of quality bass drops. dnb? This is just d. Keep searching."
5,A must have for migraineurs and their support systems.,Anyone that has migraine or knows someone close to them with migraine should have this book!It really lets you into the perspective of what it takes to be with such a horrible disease.
5,Best explanation of migraines yet!!,"I have suffered from migraines for 20 years now. Trying to put into context for my family the pain and confusion that comes with migraines is difficult. This book gives excellent descriptions of what sufferers must endure, and was an eye opener for my family when my own words fell short of capturing the painful ordeal. I highly recommend this book to sufferers and non-sufferers alike!"
5,DO Read This Book!,Best verbal picture of a migraine headache I have EVER read. Anyone who knows people who get migraines should read this book. It should be REQUIRED reading for doctors!
2,"Inflated, inaccurate pricing.","I found most prices for books I own (or was looking to buy) not to be accurate. The Overstreet price guide is much more realistic when you go to buy and sell (especially when you sell!). I literally threw this guide away and bought the Overstreet. Overstreet is not 100% accurate, but it is much,much closer to the truth. This industry has enough problems without complicating it more with several different price guides each touting completely different prices..."
5,Outstanding Translation and Reconstruction,"This text is the first book of literary criticism in the western literary tradition--and the most influential. It is also a how-to-write-a-successful-story text, based on Aristotle's inductive study of Greek literature. Richard Janko's rendering is the best English translation I have read. His commentary on catharsis is profound, resolving what has often been a stumbling block for many critics and theorists. His interpretation is well in line with the rest of Aristotle's philosophy and makes Aristotle's analysis even more useful for both students of literature and contemporary writers. Janko's reconstruction of Aristotle's lost book on comedy is splendid, a contribution to the history of ideas and comic theory."
2,pretty bad,"Rented this movie because am a Kevin Smith fan and the reviews souned great. This movie is more like a high school film production and therefore probably only can be enjoyed by those involved in the making of it. If you are a 15 year old boy who just discovered Catcher in the rye you might really enjoy it.I was bored,it wasn't funny,best to describe is stupid."
5,THE BEST MOVIE,"This movie gets funnier and funnier each time i watch it. Catcher in the Rye is one of my all time favorite books and I loved all of the references. Gonna buy this movie, renting isn't enough. Can't wait to see what these guys do when they get a bigger budget."
1,wrong product recieved,I ordered 3 Pyle Cd Players. What was recieved was 3 Pyramid subwoofers. The retailer said it was a problem on Amazon's side >that the SKU # of incorrect. They said they would issue a credit if I shipped the product back AND removed the nagative comment concerning the retailer. It took over a week for them to recieve the product. It took an additional 4 days for them to inspect the product and 2-3 more days to issue the credit.
3,This tube pops easily,An OK tube for this price paid but it can pop easily if overinflated. I recommend always having a spare on hand.
5,What can you say about an inner tubr,"Kids on my block needed an inner tube, so I ordered them one. They must have been satisfied, because they reached an agreement with me -- they would earn money to contribute half on another one and they did. So I am happy and so are they. They loved the promptness of delivery."
5,Good resource,"This is a good reference for alphabets and numbers. There is a variety of fonts, and the designs include the surrounding peices to help incorporate the charachters into larger designs."
5,i dig it!,"I love this CD! The deep level of communication and ""teamwork"" between each player of the quintet is probably what makes it most enjoyable for me. Musicians like these would be both rich and famous if i ruled the world! I wish this CD had better distribution so that others could share in its energy and enthusiasm, not everybody is lucky enough to room with Dick Titterington's nephew!"
5,Absolutely wonderful account of WW 2,"I enjoyed all four hours of this video. I lived through that period in time and remember it vividly. The color and video quality were excellent. This video is as good as any other I have seen. The film ""is what it is"" a collection of color clips taken by people who never heard of Martin Sheen.A few reviewers describe it as being innacurate and biased and berrating Martin Sheen while calling him un-American etc. I don't believe that they saw the video at all only because Martin Sheen narrated it. Apparently, these people are fans of Ann Coulter. If anyone is biased it is they. Martin Sheen only narrated (which I thought he did very well), he didn't write the script. Don't let a few Extreme Right Wing Radicals deprive you of an enjoyable video. Biased??? Oh, give me a brake."
1,Highly inaccurate and biased revisionism,"Perilous fight is a thinly veiled re-edited version of World War II. Having read dozens and dozens of books on World War II and viewed numerous histories, as well as having visited historical sights related to WWII, both in Asia and Europe, the information here was so politically biased as to be ludicrous in its anti-war stance. It is no surprise then that the well known actor and anti-war activist Martin Sheen is its narrator. Insulting to the intelligence of the average person. Reading or viewing personal narratives of American soldiers and American prisoners of war in the Pacific arena would be far more enlightening as to what the U.S. was truly fighting for, not this poor re-write of history that is blatantly anti-American, Anti-war and Anti-truth. One of the least accurate ""histories"" I have come across. The only saving grace of this DVD is the color footage from the time period. Not recommended."
2,Martin Sheen from the 'Left Wing',It is really a mixed experience to watch my favorite subject 'WWII' narrated by an ultra leftist 'Martin Sheen.' I would suggest 'WWII in color: the lost archives' instead.
2,Disappointed,"The Washington, DC section is only 14 pages which is short considering only 1 store is on each page and she omitted suburban MD and VA. In the intro she mentions that Bethesda and Alexandria are just a short distance away, but she doesn't list any stores. The big furniture stores are only found in MD and VA, not within DC."
3,A long song of praise to IBM's mainframes,"The book is one, massive song of praise to the IBM mainframes. It seems to be outside the imagination of the author, that anyone could consider choosing anything else. So you should not buy this book, if you want a serious discussion of the pros and cons of mainframes.Instead you get seemingly endless presentations of IBM's various product numbers like the following quotation:""Model E01 to E08 configurations support 1 to 8 CECs with 2-, 3-, 4-, 5, or 6-way R1-based processor units in each CEC. The models support a minimum of 3 ESCON channels per CEC and a maximum of 48 added in increments of 3. If more than 24 ESCON channels are required ...""So if all you want is an accessible catalogue of IBM mainframe products, I guess this book will be well chosen. Otherwise I will not recommend it."
4,Just a great vocalist,"Solid songwriting, driving guitar riffs, fantastic vocals ... what more do you need? While not one of my favorites (maybe yet), the album fits well in my stack of not so loudly rocking albums of JLT. Some of his work doesn't let you enjoy his range and depth. This album does. Nothing fantastic in ways of standout songs but nothing gross or irritating either...not that I'd say that about any of his solo records. ""Hit the Switch"" really has a great intro to it. Let me caveat this review by saying I listened to HTP 2 right before this album and this album was such a refreshing and pleasant change after it that I might be a bit more favorable. ""Driving with my eyes closed"" is a bit too screamo for me but it is fun lyrically."
3,"I haven't Understood Anyhting Since 1962, and Other Nekkid Truths",This is a whole hour of looking at a new housing developement and stating it is different than the farm field that used to be here. If you find comfort in being stuck in the past you will love this tape but look for me I the future. Tape was blah but I am a woman and the author does not know what women want.
5,I haven't understood anything since 1962,The first book I have ever read in my 55 years that actually made me laugh out loud while reading. This is the funniest book since the Clinton administration or the Gore/Bush election. Truely hilarious!
5,An Interesting Historical Overview,"I really enjoyed this documentary. It gives are really well balanced overview of what happened to lead up to Pearl Harbor and how the bombings effected the american people. You get a lot of different perspectives on why Pearl Harbor happened and what life would have been like if we had not been pulled into war. It's not glamourus, but it is a well done product."
5,Divine Romance,"This book was very inspiring, it gave you a new perspective into your Christian life. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a refreshing in their lives. It gaves a new understanding of what God's purpose is with our lives, and what it means to long after your own kind."
1,item stinks,"went i got my purchase,it did not work, i replase the batteries and it stell did not work.i requst a refund.do not buy."
3,tight,looks nice (I like the high cut; less visible) but elastic around the legs is tight and uncomfortable. Try ordering a size up.
1,Full coverage?? Try NO coverage!!,"These panties are nylon/spandex--not cotton. They're as sheer as pantyhose! They're entirely see through. They're horrible. Save your money. You might as well wear a pair of stockings without panties, because you'll be covered just as well, which is to say not at all. I am shocked at how horrible these panties are. Shocked! Do no waste your money on these."
4,Perfect!,This is my favorite style and brand. They fit well and practically invisible panty line. Expensive but worth it to me.
2,"Painful, but has its moments","Like Queens `Hot Space`, or Dave Matthews `Everyday` this album can be seen two or three ways: Sheer Rubbish, a change in direction, or just an album that takes some getting used to. Six months later, I can say that I am still undecided. It has its few good moments, like The One or Wasted Kisses. Otherwise all the songs blend into one long generic R&B/Rap album. The good news is that he released a much better album the following year. But you should take a listen for yourself."
1,I made the mistake of buying this CD . . .,". . . a mistake which it only took two listens to correct. In fact, I was so disappointed in this disc that I finally gave up on almost all of the Artist's post-Lovesexy works. While I hope that Prince can once again become an innovator, this album secures his solid place among the imitators. It is not recommended for anyone who wishes to remain fond of the Prince legacy."
1,The Worst,"After releasing Emancipation, the Artist returned with a single album. I assumed the Artist would treasure his precious freedom with a strong album. But I just threw it away after listening to it once. It was his worst album, maybe aiming at tarnishing his music kingdom. Ironically, every album released by Warner Bros. is stronger than this! Could any artist become a star with this? But the Artist really became a superstar with 1999, Purple Rain and Sign or the Times! His recent albums Graffiti Bridge, Diamond and Perals, Come, The Gold Experience and Chaos and Disorder are far better than Emancipation (possibly a strong album in 2 CDs) and this rubbish!"
2,"The Artist comes to the hole with weak stuff, but . .","He gets to the free throw line with 2 cuts that rank among his best of the 90's: the lovely ""the One"" and the funky ""Come On,"" which echoes of his incredible work as ""Camille."" ""Wasted Kisses"" (track 47) also helps the cause. The rest is tepid throwaway stuff that is just lazy. Just buy the singles ""Come On"" and ""The One"" and call it a day."
2,NOT WHAT I'D EXPECTED,"ON RECIEVEING MY CD IT LISTED 10 SONGS BUT WHEN I PUT THE DISC IN MY PLAYER ,50 SO OPTIONS CAME UP.IT WAS LIKE LISTENING TO BLANK AIR THEN A SONG WOULD PLAY.I'M NOT HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE."
3,i must admit i can feel the new power soul,Despite 2 or 3 tracks this album is a gem with key songs that are unbelievable. Prince just knows how to funk no doubt about it!. Come On great laid back ooey gooey Funk ! The One a soulful Ballad that show's prince's Falsetto is top notch! but if you really want to see if this album is for you just check out the samples on top otherwise buy it. The key is when you play it play it with a good sound system on high volume! Great for saturdays when you really want to make some noise!
2,2TRAX @ this RELEASE STAND OUT!,"THE album altogether is a ROYAL DISAPOINTEMENT,BUT on a positive note: THE ONE, COME ON. R GOOD TRAX."
3,A dissapointment,"Unfortunately, this album is a dissapointment. I saw Prince twice in concert in the months leading up to the release of this cd, and I was really hoping that he would capture some of the energy of his live shows with Larry Graham on this disc. But, it just does not work. Instead, the album is just run-of-the mill wannabe top 40 R&B. I think Prince needs to forget about trying to make top 40 sounding hip hop like this and take some creative chances like he did in the 80s. The hidden track ""Wasted Kisses"" and ""Come On"" are good songs, but overall the disc dissapoints this long time Prince fan."
1,Not So Powerful,"Newpower Soul finds Prince trying to get back to his funky roots, but also trying to update his sound by adding sampling and rapping. Prince is such an original artist and trendsetter, that the attempt to update his sound to get with the current scene is highly disappointing. There are no bright spots on this album and definitely the worst of his career."
2,His Royal Blandness...,"Wtih this album, the ""Artist"" really hit a nadir after a long, disappointing slide into irrelevance and self-indulgence which began - arguably - with 1992's ""Symbol"" album.This is bland ""party"" music, with a capital ""B"" - although there are a couple of nice touches here and there such as the instrumental coda to ""If You Love Somebody"", ""New Power Soul"" is totally lacking in any excitement, originality or great songs.When you think of what the guy is capable of, you can understand why he was loathe to put his own name as the ""artist"" or as Prince or whatever to this utterly insignificant recording (it was credited to the NPG). This one really is for the diehards (like me!) only.PS. If you wanna check out some quality post-""Diamonds & Pearls"" stuff by the Purple One, I would invest in ""The Gold Experience"", his most satisfying 90's collection or check out his latest, ""The Rainbow Children"" - a startling return to something approaching Prince form."
3,"""I have heard worse from him ""","This is not half bad this is a beat driven party funk cd! The beats are tight if you listen to them. There isn't any Rock or crossovers on here but it is creative! Stand Outs are ""One and Freaks on this Side and Of Coarse the Amazing and Classic ""Madsex""! If you like the Funky Prince this is the one to get. There is a Part 1 to this but it was only released in (Europe)and I believe is out of Print. It is Entitled ""Exodus"" and is much better than this! IF YOU REMEMBER THE SONG ""GOOD LIFE"" AND ""COUNT THE DAYZ"" (Girl 6 soundtrack) those tracks are on ""Exodus""!Arish"
4,the live show gows to the studio and gets madsexyfunkified,"ever notice that everyone wants to say how long they've listened to the artist/prince? this cd is a great tribute to the friends of the artist who have partied, cried and prayed at the the live shows for so many years. with inspiration from some of the greatest funkateers, the artist has packed the energy and love of his live shows into 60 some-odd dancable minutes. there is a reason that many of us still call him a prince!"
4,this cd is very funky and fresh,"The Artist and the NPG really no how to lay down in your face fresh funk. The snyth grooves and tight horn sections along with real instruments and layered vocals make this a nice party cd. Old school funk fans will hear a lot of Parlament-Funkadelic, EWF, and Prince in this cd. It may be too funky for non funk believers, because the grooves never stop. This really sounds like ""free"" music. The NPG band as always, is very tight delivering this funk."
4,"The ""Artist"" touches on new unrefined territory.","I am a long time ""friend"", as the ""Artist"" describes hs faithful listeners; therefore, I feel it only fair that I express my pleasure in this CD. For those who have listened to the ""Artist"" as long as I have the ""Newpower Soul"" CD was very refreshing. Although it did not contain the soul searching songs of a ""Sign Of The Times"", it did have a few mind bogglers. The ""Artist"" revisited his on going saga with his former record compamy in the ear tugging cut ""Mad Sex"". Then just to show us all that funk is not dead, he hit us with ""Push It Up"". I have read some of the other reviews/comments, and it is obvious that even in this stage of his career the ""Artist"" still commands attention from his devoted ""FRIENDS"", especially myself. I truly hope that other enjoy this CD as much as I do."
1,No ending,"I give Halderman 5 stars but the book only one star. I bought this book to read on a flight from Seattle to Chicago. My previous Haldeman all 5 stars and I looked forward with high expectations of this nove. I wasn't dissapointed with ""Old Twentieth."" As usual Haldeman's plot and characters were well detailed, amusing, and intrigue. Planned it out so I could finish the book on my flight back to Seattle starting with Chapter 15 ""Duck."" One hour from Seattle and started Chapter 20 ""Conspiracy."" The book was bulding torward a climax resolving all the mysteries laid out in in the previous chapters. Page 258 IS THE LAST PAGE, the next is the 1st page ""Praise for Joe Haldeman"" and continues to page 18 the last page in the book, 32 pages (the ending chpaters) gone. First time ever I had purchased a book with a mega pugbishing error. So I give ""One Star"" for Berkely Publishing and Amazon."
2,let's face it - a bad book,"I have no doubt that Joe Haldeman is a great guy, but this book is a stinker. The individual 20th century scenes are fine, but the overall story goes nowhere, and the technobabble is laughable. The (lack of an) ending is particularly irritating also.I have to complain about the refueling scene near the beginning of the book... the justification given for sending fuel in separate ships makes no sense, the writing is dull, and nothing happens. It adds nothing but padding."
2,Ruined by a cop-out ending,"As you'll read in the more positive reviews of this book, most of it is an enjoyable exploration of an interesting world, with decently developed characters, an intriguing history, some rather engrossing puzzles. Then in literally the last five pages Haldeman essentially throws it all away, with an ending so bad, so abrupt, so self-denying, that it reaches back and sucks most of the interest out of the earlier narrative. Not only are we not going to get the answers to the various puzzles, but the puzzles themselves might not really have existed at all. Or something.Not recommended, unless you must read everything he's ever written. Or if you can stop just before the end, and finish it better yourself."
3,"Started great, built up great...the fizzled","I've read several of Joe Haldeman's books. I was skepetical of this one at first, but thought I'd give it a try. I almost couldn't put it down once I started reading. Then I got to the last part.I don't want to spoil the ending, but so I'll just say it's a letdown. The world Haldman created with this boook is great and I'd love to read more stories set in it, but the ending realy detracts, even so I'd still recommend it."
2,dissapointing ending,"I'm glad I picked this up at the library rather than spending my own money on it. _Old Twentieth_ starts off with a gripping beginning to an interesting plot (outlined below by numerous reviewers) and the book has some good twists. But the ending left me furious. The teaser on the cover of the paperback edition advertises a great twist at the end.(((SPOILER ALERT))))At least one reviewer below notes that the great twist is similar to a certain Keanu Reeves movie trilogy. This book is more than similar - it mimics the trilogy flat out! A machine controls the humans in stasis, providing a series of complex virtual reality images to their brains as they travel through space until one human (again) realizes what is happening and the machine resets everyone's internal storyline back to a shared point in the past. Worst of all, this book was published in 2005, well after the aforementioned movie trilogy appeared. Didn't anyone else see the similarities?Thoroughly disappointing"
2,was very slow,"The story was very slow, I had to push myself to keep reading and not abandon it. It finally got more interesting & picked up a little further than the half-way mark. Though it finished better than it started, I'd rather have read something else. Oh, and something else I don't like about Haldeman's books - he always has to have sex in them - I do like his writing otherwise. But after two books in a row (Forever war) I've had enough. I like sci-fi for the sci-fi - not for some author to try and titillate me."
3,Beautiful book made in China,"The presentation is truly beautiful, with the tiny Buddha statue and the book tucked into the back of the box, but I feel that those who support Tibet might want to know that this lovely piece was made in China."
4,Very good introduction to Buddha and Buddhism,"This book does a pretty good job of introducing Buddhism. My only complaint is that there is no mention of Pure Land practice (which the same author does mention in her Kwan Yin Box set). But the included statue and shrine-box are a nice addition for those interested in Buddhism but who don't have a lot of money to spend on images, etc. All things considered, if you are new to Buddhism, I strongly recommend that you get this set, but also buy a good introductory book on the branch of Buddhism that you are interested in as well."
3,Severe Omission,The omission of Theravade Buddhism is very severe indeed. Theravada Buddhism is the single surviving line of the Hinayana tradition that dates to the earliest semblences of Buddhism. Ignoring that teaches the reader little.I give this book 3 stars for the pictures and the figure. But if you want to read some real educational material on Buddhism then don't buy this book.
3,"It's really easy to use, with clear instructions. ...","It's really easy to use, with clear instructions. Besides, it also provides information about Hepatitis C. The results are fast. At first, I was a little scared to do a blood test by myself. But with clear instructions, it wasn't as hard as I thought. It's cheaper and more convenient than doing the test in the lab."
2,recv'd wrong test kit....just asked for credit and got it very quickly.,recv'd credit promptly when I contacted and returned item free of charge-how difficult can it be to pick one item correctly?
3,get tested early,"In many cases Hepatitis are only discovered when they have progressed to a state which have caused permanent damage to the body and treatment is too late. If you don't want to be late, it is wise to test earlier. Visit [...] or click on HIV Home Tests for more info!i go to here to get tested for other kind of STDsthey have chlamydia, gonorrhea, Hepatitis B Hepatitis C, Syphilis testing device in affordable pricing.all and all, highly recommended to everyone !"
4,This is a good product. Collecting the blood ...,"This is a good product. Collecting the blood is not fun, but not too painful. The cost is pretty high, but if insurance doesn't pay, it would be a good deal. The results came back in the stated time and were easy to understand. A lot of what they say is to check with your doctor though, so it's not something that's entirely independent. It does give you a way to check for Hepatitis C with confidentiality."
5,"I was very excited about trying this """"at ...","I was very excited about trying this """"at home"""" test, because I'm a laboratory tech and perform testing all day long. It didn't disappoint me. Everything I needed to collect a blood sample from my finger was included. The instructions were illustrated and very simply written. There were also phone numbers to call if you had trouble collecting the sample or questions related to Hepatitis C. The cost may seem a little steep, but our lab offers this test for $75 and that doesn't include the doctor, office fee, or the time missed from work. This is a great test to screen for Hep C, especially if you have had blood transfusions or multiple sex partners. I'll receive my results via phone in 10 days with a """"passcode number"""" included with the kit. If there are problems, the company can refer me to a physician in my area."
3,Yet another Shock Rock Parody,"From the people who have brought you Phallus in Wonderland and Live from Antartica, GWAR once again brings you a parody of everything taboo. The kings of shock did it again, but does anyone care?"
4,"Death, Blood, Monsters, Lemoore, and..... GWAR!","Hey, there Antichrist children of the world! All I can say is, ""GWAR! GWAR! GWAR!"" I mean, they kill everything! It's so awesome with all the blood and fighting. They really stand for somthign, you know? Lots of people don't understand.... They think it's all for fun, or for show, but it's abotu life. They can't see the dark underbelly of our world, it can only be redemmed with blood. I mean, GWAR must be our leaders... Do you realize how many times they've been killed, only to rise again! I love GWAR. Long live death. Buy all their stuff."
1,Repulsive and sickening,"As a mother of 3 young children I think this video is the work of the devil. Filled with satanic themes and disgusting, perverted anomilies...."
1,Lots of holidays missing.,"Yet another mostly American holiday book. Lots of info is not quite accurate (ie - Bird Day, April 9 - is actually International Migratory Bird Day and should be on May 10 (according to the National Audubon Society!)) Cute to look up your birthday but otherwise a waste of $$"
4,Worth It,"If you need a book like this, (you know who you are) it gives you a reasonable strategy and things to work on to try to save a relationship. The Christian support woven through the book adds another level of support to those who are leaning on God for added support.I think it is useful for the people who need advice on the subject."
1,Terribly Sad for Men,"After having read ""Winning Your Husband back"" with it's sexist, misogynistic views, I was dying to read ""Winning your Wife Back"" and equally horrid book. I realize there are some terrible men out there, but this books generalizes that all men whose wives have bailed out are abusive. This book is degrading to men. That's what happens when you try to fit all men into the same mold (or all women). Most men aren't villians, most women aren't victims. I'm tired of these so called Psychologists/Professionals making it out so. People have to remember: The only people who go to shrinks are people in desperate situations. This tends to skew their viewpoint quite a bit. Also keep in mind that this book was written by an elderly man with very narrow views of a world that has gone the way of the DoDo."
2,If you're the one that screwed up...,"I couldn't get past the first few chapters.My wife is the one having the affair and leaving me. Nothing to gain for me here.Also, not for the humanists, agnostics, or atheists out there."
3,Good Book,"It seems to be split between those couples who've physically separated, and those who are going to if things don't change. Still plenty of good info, just as all Smalley's are."
1,For Wife Beaters Only,This book assumes that the guy was at fault in everything.If that's you it might help.No advice was available for the rest of us.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
3,Be very careful and alert,"My now ex wife purchased this book for me while we were separated under the pretense that I needed to learn of sacrificial love which is covered under one of the chapters. The entire time she was sleeping around with one of her employees. I certainly learned quite a bit about sacrificial love. All I can say is please be careful, alert and don't let your spouse run all over you. There are always two parties in a marraige and in a divorce. I wish you all the best."
3,What you need to know before buying this book...,"1. Disappointingly there is nothing on MFC (except to say it came out after the book was written). If you prefer non-MFC programming you'll like it. 2. Be aware that previous windows programming experience and knowledge of C and C++ is most definitely required. 3. The book is WindowsCE v1 only. No mention of WinCEv2 or v3. 4. Some of the example listings are badly laid-out, making them hard to read (although the source is on the supplied CD-ROM) This is the first WindowsCE programming book I've seen, and it's already out-of-date. :-("
2,Pass on this book for programming WinCE v2,"The book appears to be written for version 1 of WinCE. The sample code was not formatted to fit the printed page and it is fairly difficult to read. If you are looking for CE 2 features such as the new UI elements, MFC or COM then this book is not for you. The one shining point of the book is it's coverage of the CE help system."
5,Great little grill,"First one arrived broken due to poor packaging but the second one we received is great. It's typical Lodge quality (very good). It may not be clear from the picture, but it doesn't have long holes in it, it has regular grill lines that span the narrowest width. There are molded handles on both ends that curve up. One side has a lip that angles up and on the opposite side it angles down. It has a base support along the bottom edge so that it will sit flat (even with the lower lip on the opposite side). I have used this under our broiler as another reviewer suggested and it works great. However, it was probably designed to be used with a camp stove."
4,Live Actors in CG environment for story,"NFS Carbon is another fun and exciting game by EA. It continues where NFS Most Wanted left off. NFS Carbon is all about turf wars. IT has the best graphics. The graphcs are better then all of the other NFS games. You can access ""XBOX LIVE MARKET PLACE"" where you can buy parts or cars. not to mention the Collector's eddition comes with all the ""goodies"" you are going to need for online play.

5,The Best ever!,Two of the best python films made Holy Grail & Now for Something Completely Different. The most original comedy I have seen in years. NFSCD is the best because it pulls sketches from all there original shows only thing it was missing was Sit On My Face.
4,"One of the best sounds in (cheap) earphones, superior to more expensive brands","I own many headphones, including expensive Bose, and this small and clever Sony earphone has one of the best sounds in town. Maybe the design does not fit perfect 100% to the ear, but is worth it all the ways..."
4,Bought these to replace my Q22LPs,"These seem lighter and less noticeable then the Q22LPs. I enjoyed using those while working out or running. These easily sound as good/clear and seem to be as comfortable, if not more so. I have noticed with my ears (all ears are different) that I would get some discomfort after wearing for an extended period of time, ie a movie and then a few hours of mp3s... YMMV"
4,Great Headphones,"I am usually listening to headphones at work, and I needed something more comfortable than earbuds. I went with these ones based on the reviews, and they have worked out great. They are very comfortable on the ear, and I'm able to use them for long periods at a time. My only complaint would be the cord- it's a little too long and tends to get tangled easily. But other than that, I'm happy with the purchase."
4,Excellent for the price,"I'm extremely happy with these... they really are pretty good for something that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. The sound is very clear, and the earphones are quite comfortable. I have problems keeping most earbuds in my ears, so this design is ideal. Hopefully they are durable too, but I haven't had them long enough to really be able to say anything about this aspect."
2,Not pleased with product,"These Sony MDR-Q23LP headphones hurt if you wear them for a few hours at a time like I do. I go for long distance walks and like having my iPod with me. If you plan on wearing these for 20 minutes, you should be fine. But for several hours, these headphones begin to pinch your earlobes. I read warnings about this in product reviews right here on Amazon before I decided to purchase them but I assumed that the users had big ears! Thus I ignored these bad reviews. That was stupid! In fact, I have small ears and these headphones DEFINITELY pinch. I would have kept quiet but I just received an email from Amazon asking me for my opinion so here it is. Don't buy these. The best I can say is that they are not as bad as earbuds."
3,Great for the price.,"I bought these to workout with. They serve that purpose well. Not great, but I would buy again, or seek out a similar pair if available."
4,Nice Headphones,"I love music and I take my Zen player with me everywhere, I mean I NEVER leave home without it. So naturally I've gone through a few pairs of headphones, and I absolutely LOVE the clip on ones. They don't mess up your hair and they can't fall off your ears. You can even leave one ear free to talk on the phone or whatever, and still not miss a minute of music! Awesome! And these are black so they match with everything, I highly recommend!"
3,Average Headphones,"The reviews for these looked pretty good, so I bought them. I desperately needed something other than ""earbud"" type ear plugs, because those things just do not stay in my ear, and when they do, they are painful. These are alright, not uncomfortable, but not really comfortable either. I know they are on my ears, sometimes they start to slip off. They collect sweat on the pads and can get kind of gross, I find myself wiping them on my shirt at least once at the gym. The cord is really really long, which can either be a good thing or a bad thing depening what you intend to use them for. For me, the cord is kind of an annoyance always getting caught on machines. The second day I had them I dropped them on the ground and one of the little interchangeable shells popped off and wouldnt go back on, so now I'm wearing them ghetto style. Not very durable, but they still work, so whatever. I won't buy them again, but they are doing thier job."
5,Good,"The book was in perfect condition and seems like it will be a good read. I love fast cars and cool rides, so this will be interesting to analyze from a sociological standpoint."
1,WRONG SIZE,"This item is not nine inches wide. It is the same width as the seven stick cornstick pan, but costs ten dollars more. So you are paying ten dollars to get two extra cornstick molds of the same size. Hopefully, the item description will be changed soon. Now, I have to pack up and ship back several of these, but at least Amazon is paying the freight. Lodge Logic is the greatest for cooking and baking though. I think this is just a random error. Just be sure and buy the seven stick pan for 7.99. The cornsticks will be the same size."
3,"Teeny, tiny pones","Good quality product, but the cornpone spaces are too small. Makes really tiny pones. Not the larger ones like my grandmother's cornpone pan. Pones also stick and are hard to remove without tearing. Takes a lot of shortening to prevent sticking."
5,Make Perfect Cornsticks With This Pan,"I am very happy with this Lodge pan. Place it in the oven when preheating and mix the cornbread batter. I usually add a few drops of yellow food coloring to the batter to make it more attractive. When up to temperature, remove the pan from oven (carefully) and spray with cooking oil. I use a small, about eighth cup, scoop to fill each mold. Bake about 15 minutes, until golden brown. Remove from the pan immediately. You will be happy with the results."
4,corn sticks,Wish sticks were a bit larger but they will do overall. Pans are treated well and I had no problem with batter sticking. Corn sticks came out very well.
1,Did not perform like I thought -- corn muffins STUCK to the mold even after being well sprayed with cooking spray !!,I do not think I would order anything again from this company -- and it was not cheap !! Thanks
4,OK Hard drive,Bought this for a client. Worked out of the box. Quiet operation. Client happy. I got paid.
4,Hard drive shmard drives.,"Very good product, packaging was not wasteful, installation was easy, software was intuitive and easy to use. I have an older laptop that does not support this size of hard drive but, Disk Wizard (software included) installed a Dynamic Drive Overlay (DDO) and made everything a breeze."
2,Noisy for a Seagate. Slow too.,Should have purchased from a retailer where I could have at least exchanged or returned without the hassle. Slow and Noisy seagate HDD.
3,Just Okay,"It cleans okay on light dirt, but didn't work well on spots that were more dirtier. Would only recommend for light cleaning."
1,Doesn't work,"I have a one year old Achilles inflatable that I needed to clean up before putting away for the winter. I bought this product thinking it to be the best for this type of boat. Wrong! Not only did it not remove heavy stains, it didn't even remove light stains or dirt, even if you used brute force!So I went into my garage and pulled out a bottle of ""boat soap"" from West Marine and with no elbow work or effort at all the dirt and stains were easily removed. Even though the boat soap is designed for rubber boats I thought I'd give Maguiar's a try based on their advertising. Big mistake. Will never use again. It is no better than using vinegar and water."
2,WORKS GREAT!,LIVE IN THE CALIFORNIA DESERT (PALM DESERT) AND IT GETS VERY HOT!MY EXPENSIVE RV TIRES WERE STARTING TO CRACK ON THE SIDEWALLS.THIS PRODUCT ACTUALLY WORKS. HAVE YET TO FIND A BETTER PRODUCT.
5,"Review ""After the Finish Line""","This book tells it like it is. There is a dark side to the owning/training/showing of horses, and there are the equine ""angels"" who do their best to help equines when their days of profitability are over. The only negative is that the book is a bit outdated since the 3 American slaughterhouses have shut down and the horses are now going to Mexico and Canada."
3,"try say ""T'an Jung-hui Chung-kuo p'eng jen"" with a mouthful","excellent recipes, curtains of beef some of the best i've tasted."
5,Excellent album,"It has been a while since their last CD. It is nice to hear their song again. This is an excellent album with great songs. This album has slow to mellow songs. It is a mix of R&B and POP. Once you pop the cd in the stero you won't want to skip any songs because it is all too good to skip. If you are a blackstreet fan, you will definitely like this album. If you are not a fan, you should get it too because it is an album you don't want to miss."
3,The Cd is okay,"The cd is okay I guess, but I was thinking that it would be like Level I, nice and slow love songs, instead, it is like they are trying to have clubbing music. Level II is nothing like level one to me. It's just riding music I guess, something to bump in your trunk to stay awake at night."
2,Not quite,It's my 2nd listen...and i'm still holding out some hope that it might start to grow on me.But it just doesn't seem to have any killer tracks.Level II? Somehow I think they just won't ever top 'Another Level'
1,C.R.A.P.,This CD is crap...start to finish. I bought this CD without hearing any singles on the radio because I was so glad that they had reformed Blackstreet with the members from Another Level (Not the original members). Another Level was a good CD with NO bad songs so I thought this one would be at least similar. I was wrong. There is only one or two good songs on here. It was a big waste of money.
4,The bomb diggy,This is a nice CD these boys came back strong in a major way check this one this is some hot [music]
1,horrible,"this cd was absolutely worthless. I am glad i got this album burned and didnt go buy it in stores. Do not pick up this cd. I felt blackstreet could have produced some better songs but they didnt. Dont buy it, dont even burn it"
2,A little disappointed,"I'm a fan of Blackstreet and loved their music since day 1. I gotta say that this album only had a few good trackz. Regardless of all the negative reveiws I read about this album, I went and picked it up anywayz. From all the previous albumz they released, I was never once disappointed but this time, I was. To me, the most memorable track on this album is ""It's so hard to say goodbye"". This track was probably the most well written track on the album. The rest of the slow jamz on this cd was laright but could've been better. ""Wizzy Wow"" has got to be the most annoying song I've ever heard."
1,These R&B thugs get no love,Blackstreet was one of the most promisng R&B groups of the nineties but why they decided to change their image into R&B thugs is questionable to me. Level II was one of the worst R&B cd's ever released and only has two good songs the opener Ticket To Ride and the slow jam Deep. Other wise skip this one.
1,the end of an era,"Some time back, Teddy Riley lost his artistic touch. Level II reafirms he still hasn't found it yet. Teddy has made the producer's mistake in assuming an album with computer-generated music is with the times. In Level II, the only natual instruments in the whole album is 1 Acoustic guitar and an orchestra. Vocally, this album leaves much to be desired in the realm of the ballads that this particular version of Blackstreet is known for. On top of that, there is another crucial misenterpitation of the times. The profanity and sexual conotation that this album contains is the very same thing that sunk the last Bell Biv DeVoe album. In Wizzy Wow, Teddy boast that he is a legend."" In my opinion, he's a fallen legend. The last Guy album that Teddy produced was 10 times better than this. To Teddy: New Jack Swing ain't dead! R.Kelly is duing more for your style than you are, the man who invinted it!"
3,not all that grand...,"i bought this cd because i'm a fan of blackstreet, esp. teddy riley and i thought what would be the harm in picking up their latest album.....well thank goodness i got it on the release date [for a discount]or i would have had many regrets. this album is not their best...point blank on a scale of one to ten and ten being the highest its a 5. i mean you wouldn't give them lower because they have established themselves as artist, but i think we expect more. then again maybe their time is just up. so i would give thme a five just because of how far they've come.... but hardcore fans would buy the album also. so it's ok. i wouldnt' go tell a friend hey pick up the ne Blackstreet album its nothing thats going to get much praise from me."
2,not the same anymore,once upon a time Teddy Riley had a Musical Stroke of Gold&He could do no wrong but those days seem long gone.despite bringing BlackStreet back&having some moments on this new set Teddy&crew just don't seem to have it anymore.something is missing for me.the songs seem more or less just there&unless something changes it's safe to say for now that I can remember when Teddy Riley was on the cutting edge before He just settled for getting by.
3,It's Okay but...........................................,First let me say that Teddy Riley is one of the most gifted musicians of our time! With this effort I don't think Teddy was really giving it his all.
3,3.5 stars - Better than good.,"By a Canadian author, it was nice to read a book set somewhere new to me; Ottawa. This is a solid police procedural with fully-developed characters, interesting forensic information, clues tracked down one-by-one, and enough suspense to keep me going. I shall definitely read the other two books, so far, in this series."
4,Not what I expected,"A sincere, relevant account from a past era, in which the content is timeless. The grittiness of war and combat, to peace and acceptance, and the journey in between. Loved it."
5,A great scholarly work,"A great book for anyone who wants to gain an in depth understanding of Islamic mysticism. There are many books out there on Sufism, but Corbin's books are most"" scholarly"". It is obvious that the author spent a life time researching this topic and learning it from those who know sufism well. Same can not be said about many other so called scholars who seem to write books on a daily basis and their research scope is no more than a few trips to the local library. No wonder there are so many books being published and yet so few of them are really worth reading. Many of them leave their reader feeling cheated. I am afraid that Scholars like Corbin should be classified under endangered species."
4,Eyes of a Stanger,"Marissa is a shy teenage girl with a slight disability. One leg is shorter than the other, making her very embarrassed of her limp. She lives with her Uncle Paul at Salmon Creek Carousel, where she helps run the old Carousel. Her simple life all changes when some girls start disappearing, after she seen them all with the same guy. ""The blue sedan pulled up and her Mysterious Stranger jumped out. He opened the passenger door with his right hand, a bit awkwardly, but then he bowed with a grace that was as natural as a cat's. He reached in with his left hand to help his passenger. Marissa was not at all surprised to see a blond emerge."" This was a very well written book, with its full suspense, that kept me wanting to read more. This would not a good book for people who thrive for love and romance. Even though this was a great book it kind of jumped around and you never find out what happened to the guy that was first convicted."
1,Don't even bother reading it.,This book started out very boring. It didnt have enough information on why Nick wanted to kidnap Marrisa.It also ended in a way that you would have never expected it to end.I say it was a very dull book.
2,A boring book!!!,"This book, Eyes of a Stranger was a strange book, I couldn't wait to finish it because I wanted to start a new book. It was too boring. I still don't get the point of why the stranger wanted Marissa. For me it was just a waist of time. I would not recomend this book to anyone, but of course that was my opinion! Well, Until next time."
2,ok book i guess,i guess this book was ok except that nick had too many psychological problems and is totally a momma's boy also. it was also kind of slow and didnt have a lot of action in it... it is too boring in my opinion
5,I think Eyes of a Stranger iz tha bomb!,i think u should read this book this because it has alot of action and suspense. I think it's a great mystery.
3,It was okay!,In the beggining of the book it was sort of boring. I think it was boring because I believe it had no action or movement.What I mean by that is that you could not picture in your mind what was going on.Personally I think the ending was sort of disgusting because he (Nick) had a dirty mind in the way that he had toes in a jar.
3,"Almost, but not quite....","This was good, but not really what I expected to get. The selections are all well chosen, but after reading each of the excerpts I wanted to read more. Maybe that's the purpose. However, I felt like this anthology is just the tip of the iceberg concerning gay/lesbian literature about growing up. Overall--a good summary, but if you're looking for something more in-depth, try reading something else."
5,"Amazing, inspiring collection of gay and lesbian literature!","This is a cool anthology, combining famous writers' pieces on growing up gay or lesbian with writings by young adults. I really like the variety of kinds of writing -- short stories, poems, essays -- and the diversity of authors. I'd recommend this for anyone going through the coming-out process, as well as family members and others interested in gay/lesbian/bisexual issues. It would also be GREAT for libraries and schools"
3,Faulty product,"The track selection and sound quality are fine. However, the first two tracks on the first disc skip. There are no apparent visible faults on the disc, but it is annoying."
5,Groovy tunes,"I bought this for my husband's birthday and am planning on stealing it from him. I love music from this era, especally 1967. That was a magic summer and had wonderful music. This collection has some of the best there was during this time period. You will love it!"
4,Great Music!,"I was 10 years old in 1967, but I've always been a fan of late 60's and early 70's rock music. This was a time of burgeoning new music and genious musical artists. You'll love this collection of music from the ""summer of love."""
3,"Hey Man, It's San Francisco","OK, so I really like the AM CD...artists I didn't buy at the time but find I've grown nostalgic about now that I'm, like -- old. But the FM CD? I guess you had to be there. These artists were huge at the time, and some of them have endured. But lucky for them, their success did not hinge on these earlier recordings."
2,"Not for most women, beware!","I got this book hoping it would have some new insight and excersises to help me reach orgasm more frequently with my lover. However, I soon discovered everything in the book had already been thought of. You see, this book is aimed at women who have NEVER ever had an orgasm before in their lives, at women who are afraid to look at or touch themselves, at extremely religious couples who need to be TOLD to loosen up, and so forth. It just wasn't for me, and it isn't for most of you who are seeking more fulfillment in your sex lives. Secondly, the illustrations are drawn by a man, and they look more like bimbo models. I'm sure he enjoyed being paid to draw masturbating women. The pictures are not helpful, they're offensive."
2,"good book, but it was supposed to be a new copy, they sent me a used one","The book is great. The only disappointment was that the shipping company was supposed to send me a NEW book, I paid the price for it! They sent me a dog-eared used copy that was an old edition.LAME on their behalf. I will not buy from that shipping company again unless they do something to apologize for their unprofessional move."
3,Just one problem,"My child loves Dora and was very excited to get this particular toy as he also loves horses and cowboys. The only problem is...the hat is too small for Dora's head and will not stay on! This is very upsetting for my son and he gets so frustrated by it that I have hidden the hat completely. I did try to glue the hat on, but it did not last. Why did they make the hat so small??"
2,The hat won't stay on!,"This doll is cute, but the hat will not stay on. This is irritating to me and my daughter. I actually threw the hat away because I was tired of seeing it laying around NOT on Dora's head."
4,Bruce Campbell is my hero!,I really enjoyed this book. Took me a few pages to realize it was fictional.
3,Flop,"A real disappointment. I loved ""If Chins Could Kill"" but this is pure silly fiction. There are a couple of funny moments but all in all it is just one goofy situation after another. The story is the fictional tale of Campbell's attempt to get cast in an Mike Nichols film. The story progresses as Bruce tries to make the big budget film into more of a B-Movie all the while trying method acting and doing role research. This one is pretty poor and not nearly as much fun as it should have been. Better luck next time, Bruce!"
4,A MUST-READ for Bruce Campbell fans!,"After Bruce's success withIf Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actorthe B-movie actor went on to make another hit. Make Love! is what Bruce himself calls an auto-biographical novel. This book is about him, in his own life, but most of the events never happened. This is what makes this read fun. It is a ""what-if"" kind of book. However, unlike Chins, this book is mostly just for fans. If you are unfamiliar with his work, you may find this book to be ""uninteresting"" to say the least. Although, even being the mild Campbell fan that I am, I still found this a joyful read."
5,Bruce all the way...,"The story line is great. For the first portion of the book you wouldn't know it was fiction without a label, but it quickly spirals into the absurd making for tons of laughs in a fantastic story that could have happened in a parallel universe. Bruce's 'research' for his A movie role lands him in all kinds of situations including a reoccurring 'bump in' with the secretary of state. His portrayal of a relationship with Richard Gere is hysterical. Especially when Richard asks Bruce for advice on picking up women. Another highlight is Bruce's dinner with Liz Taylor where he interviews her about her many loves.I received the audio book version of this from my wish list on Amazon, unfortunately it doesn't seem to be available anymore. The audio version was amazing! I felt like I was in the scenes with the characters. It was created using different voices for each character and tons of sound effects, plus it was read by the author. I think it's the best audio book I have."
4,Lots of fun,"Somebody please cast Bruce Campbell in something! Else he may write another book - which I will no doubt feel compelled to read. This book is a fantasy featuring the pretend exploits of Bruce Campbell during the making of a Mike Nichols film - exploits not unlike those in the B pictures Mr. Campbell has been so effective in. I suppose the author would rather be making a picture than writing a book, but either way, he seems to be having a good time. We should all be so lucky.And this book is a lot of fun to read, although I now have a sneaking suspicion that in the wrong hands, Photoshop may not be entirely a force for good in the world."
3,It's OK but not as good as his first book.,I read Bruce Campbell's first book and it was an interesting and very funny read. So I knew he had a second book out and thought that would be interesting too. It was just about his experiences with one movie (which I admit in some places it was quite hilarious)but it was difficult to ascertain what was fact or fiction. So in my mind it made it not as funny because if it didn't really happen then.... it just wasn't funny. So I guess if this was based more on fact I think I would like it better. Oh well I was compelled to read it and the deed is done.
2,Off par from its predecessor,"I tried Bruce, I really tried. There is a parallel between this work and his old pal Raimi's film ""Army of Darkness."" Both had that type of unexpected success with previous attempts at their craft, unfortunately further attempts to capitalize on that success fell short. I don't wish to be critical of those that enjoyed the aforementioned, but high expectations have a way of making an otherwise lukewarm piece seem that much more disappointing. I'm a Bruce fan and this book is a must have for any of you wishing to delve deeper into all that is our favorite, unsung and oft neglected Hollywood hero. However, caveat emptor; especially if you're searching for that groovy sentiment we've all felt before."
2,We don't really want fiction from BC,"Bruce Campbell still rules, but the book is cheesy in more than a passage. If chins could speak (his previous work) was far way better than this."
1,Why Bruce Why?,"Ugh. I wanted to like this book. I really did. I had high hopes for it after reading his thoroughly entertaining and interesting autobiography 'If Chins Could Kill.'Page after page after page was so cringe-worthy that after a hundred pages I realized I was still waiting for it to get good - to get funny - to get entertaining. Well, a hundred pages is my limit Bruce. I just dont have that kind of time to waste.Bottomline: There's barely a coherent storyline. The laughs are nonexistant. And the writing style is along the lines of a Curious George story. I graduated college (and highschool duh) so maybe I don't fall within Bruce's target demographic.This book is perfect for an 8th grader who reads at a 6th grade level."
2,Not very good at all.,"I'm a huge BC fan and I thought his first book was great, I actually laughed out loud multiple times while reading it (which looks kind of weird on an airplane). This one misses the mark completely. As a made up account of making a movie, it fails completely. The story and events are rediculously not plausible or funny. He should stick to non-fiction."
5,Amazing Read,"Very enjoyable and awesome book, especially if you're a Bruce Campbell fan! Buy it or give it as a gift!!!"
5,One of the funniest books I've ever read!,"I couldn't put this one down, read it in one sitting. When I read it, I had the challenge of trying not to laugh out loud, and there were times that I was curled up in my chair, red faced, snickering behind my hand because otherwise I would have bust out and disturbed the people in the other room. Not many books do that to me. It made me wonder what it has to be like to live with Bruce Campbell and his sense of humor. Loved it! Another one of those books that one day I will read again."
5,"Laughed so hard, I scared the baby","I spent the first few chapters of this book totally buying it, and then I spent the rest laughing so hard I could barely breathe. At first, I sighed over the invented movie central to the book's plot; now I'm sighing in the hope that *this book* could be made into a movie! It's a B-movie in book form, and I was in heaven. The last few chapters, especially, had me howling, filled with chases, fight scenes, and unbelievable but hysterical action.Thanks, Bruce. That's the best laugh I've had in a long time. More, please?"
4,Great Fun,"First let me say that I loved If Chins Could Kill. This is not autobiographical, but is screamingly funny. Campbell has a nice twisted sense of humor, which means it's twisted funny but not humiliating to anyone - except maybe himself. Maybe he wasn't meant to be an actor - maybe he's really a writer in disguise. The title is bad though - I amost didn't read the book because it really was one of those how to get girls books."
1,"self-indulgent, much?","This book by Bruce Campbell is nothing but fanfic...about HIMSELF. With the extra attraction of photo-manipulated illustrations that seem quite homemade and lame. And a poster-sized typeface that made me double-check to see if I'd accidentally gotten the large-print edition. If you are a die-hard fan of this actor, you could probably justify the purchase of this book, but for the merely curious, check the library or wait for a possible softcover edition--it isn't worth the money in hardcover."
2,Bad Kindle Encoding . . .,"I like him as much as the next guy but Bruce: Your publisher has some quality issues. I don't know who cooked up the Kindle Version but they did a bad job and no proofreading at all.Do a search on the word lquote and you'll see what I mean. ""What's that""? you say, ""lquote isn't even a WORD""!Right you are Ash! It's (poor) HTML encoding the reader should not see at all.Otherwise okay. To others looking for Pulitzer Prize material, I suggest your expectation levels are out of line. It's Ash. The guy from the ""Evil Dead"" movies. What did you expect?"
3,"Bruce ""don't call me ash"" Campbell did it again!",loved this book! It starts out pretty normal but it keeps getting weirder and funnier! The climax pretty actionpacked and the many graphics in the book enrich the story even more.I had a fun read with this book. Bruce Campbell makes great movies (Bubba Ho-Tep WTF!) and is also a good writer.Can't wait for the next book!The only negative point is the size of the font for the book. It's huge!! looks like a childrensbook.buy this book now for a fun (but quick) read!
2,"Lame Bruce - you big, cheesy man hooker","Yeah, unlike his first book, which was good, this book seems to be just a weekend's worth of text rambling from a guy trying to steal my money and succeeding. I love Bruce Campbell, but this blatant profiteering makes my skin crawl. I'd rather him do a pop-up book! Next time, Mr. Campbell, hire a ghost writer."
3,"Starts good, but just wanted it to end.","I'm a huge Bruce fan, but I don't know how anyone can give this book a 5 star rating. It's just not very good. His other book, ""Chins"" was definitely a 5, but this one is far from that. The first 3rd of the book is good and kept my attention, but as the story progresses it just gets more and more absurd and, well, dumb. By the end I just wanted it to end so that I could continue with my life. Overall, it's not a bad book, but it's just not that great either."
2,It Knits up the Ravelled Sleeve of Care!,"I love Bruce, but I wish I had send my money directly to him instead of buying this book. I found it to be very soperific. Elderly fans may like it, though, because the type is VERY LARGE AND EASY TO READ!Hang in there, Bruce, and keep trying."
4,A fine read...,"I'm a fan of Stirling's for the chief reason he, like a handful of other military sci fi writers(Pournelle and Turtledove chiefly) write convincingly. I was disappointed by the Draka series not because of the eventual outcome but by the one sidedness of the conflict. The Draka were so much more advanced ALWAYS that it became a joke. The Chosen however set a stage between two opponents that were far more realistic with strengths AND weaknesses which the Draka series didn't have. At least the serfs showed up as real people not just household artifacs. Also it is not so technology driven to abstraction as the lopsided Draka series was. The Navy actually had an important part in the book too. I have always enjoyed reading of the 20s/30s time frame anyway and the Chosen played that up well. It had it's cutsey parts which detracted from the book but that was minor. I too would have liked to see more character development but it was a fine read and throughly enjoyable overall...."
4,Don't bother ordering this book from Amazon,"Just a warning that while it says it ships in 1 to 3 weeks, I have had an order for this book outstanding for over 8 months (since August 2005) and still no sign of it ever shipping."
4,A very good book for getting a tactical workout.,"If you already have 1001 chess sacrafices and combinations already you won't necessarily need this. But, If you want to learn how to checkmate in just about every position under the sun, or just want something to practice your calculating ability on, (Tal said calculation needs practice) Then this is the book for you!"
1,Binding is inexcusable!,"Book would be 4.5 stars if it weren't for the crappy binding. First day I opened the book the binding was basically cracked, and on the second day a page fell out. Terrible binding."
