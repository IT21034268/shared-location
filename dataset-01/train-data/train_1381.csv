4,Another Winner by O'Carroll,I enjoyed this very much - only wish it had been available before I read the the following three novels.
3,"Interesting but Insufficient Content, and Size Too Small","I find the editiorial review a good description of the textual content of the book. It provides leisurely, interesting read and the book has about 80 pages. It contains 80 illustrations (drawings and photos), of which about 40 are in color ! So, it is more a pictorial book than a book that goes into detail descriptions.This book is small and square in shape. Thus, the more complicating pictures (especially photos) lose detail when they are printed at that size. It would be more practical if the book is at least B5 size and more info provided.This book perhaps will ignite your interest in Christian symbols but not beyond that as the information is limited."
1,Total Fiasco,Redemption should not have included this title . Its basically a a bad film and not worth remastering and issuing it in the blu ray format.The camera angles are such that you cannot really see any nudity and the whole direction of the plot ( if indeed there is one)is obscure. Don't waste your money and you should skip it even if you are a fan of this form of horror fantasy movies .The sound is no better and is shrill and tinny. I will not bother to view it again !!!! and will feel guilty to palm it off on Ebay !!!!
4,"Gotta' add this one to your ""Soul-Jazz"" collection","This is great classic Soul-Jazz from Prestige Records in 69'. Two albums on one disc- ""The Soul Brotherhood"" with Charles Kynard (organ), Blue Mitchell (trumpet), David Newman (sax), Grant Green (guitar), Jimmy Lewis (bass) and Mickey Roker (drums)-this one isn't as funky as the next, but with Grant Green and Jimmy Lewis holdin' it down how can it be bad. The next one is ""Reelin' with the Feelin' with Charles Kynard (of course on organ), Wilton Felder (sax), Joe Pass (guitar), Carol Kaye (bass) and Paul Humphrey (drums)- this band gets pretty funky on cuts like ""Slow Burn"" and ""Boogalooin'"". I actually checked this out because of Paul Humphrey- he's the funky drummer on Jimmy Smith's Root Down album another favorite of mine. I have a good amount of jazz in my collection and I was hesitant to pick this up, but I'm glad I did- it's now one of my top picks. If you like jazz, funk or soul jazz (funky organ music) you will definately dig this."
5,Still Waters,"This group is ""Awesome"" If you haven't yet heard them, do.Takes you back to the disco era which is coming back."
5,Last Studio Album Of The Century!,"""Still Waters"" closed out the Century as the Bee Gees last studio album. Featuring the big hit ""Alone""; cuts ""I Surrender"", ""Still Waters Run Deep"" and ""Smoke And Mirrors"" could all have been big hits. ""Irresistible Force"" brings the famous trio in to a round-robin vocal that is truly unique. ""My Lovers Prayer"", ""I Could Not Love You More"" and ""I Will"" harken back to the power ballads the guys are so famous for. ""Closer Than Close"" and ""Miracles Happen"" seem out of step with the rest of the CD, but, hey, it's all good stuff.Last Note: If you can find the CD single or IMPORT CD with ""Rings Around The Moon"" and ""Love Never Dies"" you are in for a real treat."
3,Worked well for the first 10 months,"This monitor worked very well while it worked. The transmitter was extremely sensitive to all sounds. We were actually able to hear our daughter breathing from her crib when the monitor was across the room. No issues with reception anywhere in our two story home, and reception was also excellent anywhere in the 1/2 acre yard. The only strike against the monitor was that the transmitter stopped working after 10 months. I feel that it should have worked longer than that."
2,Good for only a bit...,"It has very good clarity and runs on the 900mhz frequency. If you have a home wireless network or newer cordless phones (which usually run on 2.4ghz) the 900 mhz monitors are really good and don't have much interference. However, the 900 mhz monitors don't have as much distance so these are good for going between 1 floor or a small to medium sized house. This also has a built in rechargeable battery which is handy for people who take their monitors around the house.However, I bought this for my newborn and it lasted about a year. First the volume dial caused a very static noise when you moved it, and then out of nowhere the battery completely died. It only works plugged in now. I think if you're the type to plug it in and never touch it again, this would work very well for you. ...we moved it around daily. I'm going to try the Sony and see how that works. ...seems to get good reviews.If you're looking for a 900mhz one that last longer than 1 child, this is not the one to get."
1,AWFUL!,"I have a hearing disability so I was thrilled to see that there was a monitor that vibrated. It was the obvious choice for me. We set it up and haven't used it until recently. We do NOT use batteries and keep it plugged in at all times. In order to be woken up to hear my son crying in the morning, I have to have the monitor LOUD. I can not turn it up high enough to hear my child with out a loud piercing whistling sound. Instead, I have to set my alarm for every 30 min and then press the monitor to my ear to hear if my son is waking up or not. This was an expensive item! Dont waste your money."
3,"Great, but doesn't have long lifespan - volume button static","We have loved the features of this monitor -- rechargeable batteriers, vibration, lights, etc. however, after only 8 months of use, we experienced a loud, crackly static problem every time we adjusted the volume button. I called Fisher Price to check into the one year warranty, and as soon as I mentioned a static problem, the customer service lady asked me if this was related to the volume button. This led me to believe that this must be a very common problem. I plan to try and obtain another FP vibration monitor; however i was disappointed to realize that the new version no longer has rechargeable batteries. This was one of the best features of the monitor -- just after vibration. I hope to still find the older version. (at the time I am writing this review, ""buying info"" is not available, so I'm not sure whether or not this version has the rechargeable batteries or not)."
3,The new version requires batteries - NOT rechargeable!!,"I received this monitor at my baby shower in June 2002. It worked great and I loved the rechargeable battery feature (like many other reviewers). One day I accidentally used the wrong charger, and I burned it up - totally my stupid mistake. I went to BRU and got a new one (April 2003). I was very disappointed to find that the new ones do not have a rechargeable battery pack - they require batteries. I am still undecided if I will keep it or go back and look for one that is rechargeable. I just wanted everyone to be aware since most reviews seem to comment on the fact that it is rechargeable."
4,Does what it says...vibrate is a great feature,"We have been using this monitor in our son's bedroom since he was born, and it has been relatively static-free with great range. The vibrate feature is extremely handy if you and vacuuming or doing another noisy activity and may not be able to hear the baby. I get occasional minor interference over the monitor, and the units are so lightweight and topheavy that they tip over easily."
2,Replacement Batteries Anyone??,"I've had this monitor for 2 1/2 years. It worked great for our first; however, after about 16-18 months use, it started crackling horribly. We constantly have to play with the volume to avoid static. Now it's to the point where we have to have it on full volume to eliminate static. I'm sure that the rechargable battery simply needs replacing; however, I can't find a replacement anywhere. It's an odd battery.The range is awesome, but if I switch channels, then I pick up my neighbor's nursery across the street. I wouldn't recommend this product for the simple fact the battery is diffcult to replace. My next monitor will opperate on good ol' AA or something recognizable."
1,Junk,"I got this as a shower gift. Some of my friends had this monitor and were happy with it. I'm not though, I'm really disappointed with this monitor. From day one we've always gotten feedback with high pitch squealing and now that my baby has moved into his own room all we get is static. Sure, when my son starts to make noise it transmits but when he is sleeping quietly all we get is LOUD static! Not to mention that the batteries only last 2 - 3 days at best - and we only use the monitor at night when we are trying to sleep! Last night it konked out completely. In my opinion this product is junk and I would not recommend buying."
4,Great product but didn't last long,"We bought this monitor for our first baby who is now 14 months old. We've been VERY happy with it but now it is dying after only a little more than a year's use. The problem I've run into is that I ALWAYS adjust the sound and now it crackles horribly with static if I touch it. I get up before my husband so I turn it off in the morning so I don't wake him when I get her. But later when I turn it on I need to adjust it to the correct sound level, especially at night so if she moves it doesn't blast my ear off. I guess after a whole year of me adjusting the volumn up and down the device has had it! If I even touch the volume dial to adjust it, it emits horrible cackling and static and is tough to get quiet again.This is a great monitor probably for most people but if you are always fooling with the volume beware it might harm it. I'd expect constant use of a product to eventually kill anything, but not after just one year!"
1,Just aweful,This monitor has nothing but static. I don't know how anyone could actually use this monitor with all the static noise. It is going back to the store today.
1,Not at all worth the money! BUZZZZZZZ!!!!!!!!,We received this as a gift because we registered for it and cannot get the static and buzzing to stop! There is no where in our house that the static and buzzing to stop - no matter what channel or the volume level. I'm so hesitant to buy another one in case we have the same problem! But alas - I will return it to the store and try again! :-( Very disappointed.
3,DONT BE SO CHEAP!!,Everyone's complaining that this doesnt work after a year or 2. Well go out and buy a new one. Its only $35. I cant beleive you people are being so cheap!!! Why bother for replacement parts when its much easier to just buy a new one!!!! Give me a break!!!
2,Too much static and interference,"I selected this monitor BASED ON THE REVIEWS HERE and I was disappointed because obviously Fisher-Price has their employees come here and say good things about this product, when in fact it has considerable flaws.THe only thing I could say about this is that it still works after a year, but there is too much static and interference and that loud 'hum' when the the monitor and receiver get too close to each other."
3,NO REPLACEMENT BATTERY,"Ditto on the battery problem. Battery wore out after 22 months of pretty heavy use. Worked great for that time period, but we are frustrated that no replacement battery (the 2/3AA) exists anywhere on the older model. 3.6V 400 MAH is nowhere to be found. Still works with the cord though."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS MONITOR,"I registered for this monitor due the favorable reviews on it and it was given to me off of my registry in Feb 2003 for the birth of our 1st child. We initloved this monitor; HOWEVER, within the past month (just over a year after receiving the monitor), we couldn't use the monitor remotely as the batteries no longer held a charge. You can't buy batteries for this model at any store and Fisher Price has discontinued it. So, although I was very happy with this model for the past year, I wouldn't recommend it because down the road, you will probably have to buy a different one anyway."
2,Too much static and poor battery quality,"This monitor started out fine, but after about 3 months we started getting a ton of static over the monitor making it sometimes difficult to sleep with it on. It also makes a horrible, loud static noise when we turn the volume up and down. The battery is fully charged as it is usually plugged in at all times...plugged in at all times as it usually only lasts for about 20 minutes if unplugged (I followed initial charging instructions to the 'T'). I am expecting another baby and will probably throw this monitor out and buy a new one!"
2,Works well for about a year and then dies...,"I had this monitor for about a year, and at that point it started to die out; I have read other reviews where this monitor died out for them at about the 10 month mark. I thought when I bought this monitor that it would last longer. I ended up purchasing the Sony monitor as a replacement, I have not had it for as long as I had the Fisher Price, so I can not accurately say how long that one will last, but so far it has been holding up very well, and has been well worth the money. If you want a monitor that will last you longer than a year DO NOT buy this Fisher Price monitor."
5,"Great monitor, great price",I really like this monitor. It works and there is not any feedback and we're in a small place. I also like the ability to use the batteries and put it on your belt. We use it if we go take the dog out or to do yard work while she's sleeping. I would recommend this.
5,We love this monitor,"I am thinking maybe the monitor has been improved over the ones that are just a year or 2 old. We love that we can hear the baby breathe with out the volume on max. The vibrate works great when the dishwasher is running or I am doing another chore that is noisy. We live in a close neighborhood with apartments very close by and nothing has interfered with the monitor. This unit does not have the recharable batteries but the hearing portion does come with an adapter that could be plugged in. Really being able to plug the unit in, I have only changed the batteries once in 6 months. I like this unit and would purchase it again."
3,Low Battery Indicator?,"I still use this model because it has clear reception. However I need a low battery indicator. I could not tell when the batteries went dead. Being a first time mom and not hearing a peep, I decided to check on my child anyway, only to discover that my child had been upstairs screaming to the point that he was loosing his breath. With a two story house I did not hear him and I still feel guilty that I wasn't there for my child. Now I always check because I don't have ""peace of mind"" when it comes to the batteries going dead."
2,Great at first but dies out with use!,"We have had this monitor for almost three years now. We used it for about 1 1/2 years and then put it away until our third child came along. The monitor doesn't hold its charge, and we cannot hear anything unless the volume dial is turned up high. It also emits crackling and static when the dial is touched. We probably will have to buy another monitor because it drives me crazy every time I try to adjust it."
4,Crackling Problem Can Be Solved,"I found that after about 8 months of using this monitor, it began making LOUD crackling sounds when I was adjusting the volume. I figured there may be some dust settling in the wheel of the volume control, so I blew some air a few times into the crack between the monitor and volume control wheel. This did the trick.....the crackling immediately stopped. So, whenever the crackling started again I would do the same and the monitor continues to work fine. All in all, this is an affordable, trust-worthy monitor which picks up every sound and is very portable."
2,Crackling after 10-12 months of use,"We used this monitor until our child turned 12 months but it suddenly produced a loud crackling noise at certain sound levels. Still, we liked it so much those first 12 months that we replaced it with an identical set. 10 months later and the crackling is back and I'm in search of a new monitor that will last more than 2 years without becoming a dud. I would not recommend this product if you expect to last longer than 10 months. I my mind a baby monitor is like any small appliance. I've had my can opener for 10 years and it still works great. My baby monitor is much more important and I expect to last for several kids, several naps and several years of sweet dreams. For us, this model does not measure up."
4,No rechargeable batteries,"This monitor does not have rechargeable batteries as some of the other reviews suggest. I owned a previous version of this monitor which did come with rechargeable batteries. I liked it very much except that the batteries eventually lost the ability to hold a charge as other reviewers indicate. I ordered this monitor to replace it not realizing that this one does not have rechargeable batteries. I was going to return it, but after researching, realized that the rechargeable version is no longer available. (I found this out by looking at the website with updates for ""Baby Bargains"" by Denise and Alan Fields - great book by the way.) I decided to keep the monitor anyway because I have not been able to find another monitor that meets my needs with rechargeable batteries."
1,Returning item,My husband and I purchased this monitor and tried it out last weekend and could get nothing but static. No matter what we did it would not work. I can't wait to return it tomorrow and get something different. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
4,disappointed,This is worth your money if you plan on only having 1 child. The battery doesn't last long. I wanted to use it two years later but the battery was dead so I called the manufacterer and they said they've discontinued that battery. I noticed they're still basically making the same unit. How cheap. I think they changed the battery so they could sell more. I asked the manufacturer since the battery couldn't be replaced if they could offer a coupon to use towards the purchase of another one and they said NO. I've never had a manufacturer not want to satisfy the customer so I'll never by this brand in anything again.
2,Devours Batteries,"I would not recommend this monitor because the batteries have to be changed every other day. Also, the battery compartment is very difficult to open and close."
2,Don't Buy This One!,"This monitor worked well at first but then suddenly it started eating up batteries. I would not recommend this monitor because by the time you are finished using it, you will probably have spent more $ on the batteries than you did on the monitor. I think I'm passing this one along to grandma for my son's occasional visits.It also crackles and hums a lot but I'm not sure if that is just a monitor ""trait""."
1,Only static,"I recently moved my daughter to her own room and needed a monitor. I purchased this one because it was the only one at the store with a vibrate feature. When I tried to use it, I got nothing but static, even with the volume turned down, the static was so bad it made the monitor light up and vibrate. I could not sleep with all the noise and could not hear my daughter crying through the monitor over all that white noise. It's going back today in exchange for a video monitor or the Sony monitor. Maybe I got a defective one, but based on my experience I would not reccomend this model to anyone."
1,dissapointment,"We bought this monitor yesterday hoping ""BabiesRus"" would only sell quality products. This monitor is not. It has constant static and Squelches constantly. I even tried putting tape over the mic to limit its reception but that didnt help. It is going back today."
3,Only good in the begining,"At first I loved this monitor. I was able to take it outside with me when I had my morning coffe, and it worked great at night, I could hear her breathing even. The dissapointment came about 7 months later. Everytime I touch the volume button it makes a horrible static sound that is so loud I think it could wake the baby in the next room. It's so bad that I finaly took it back to babies r us and got a new one. But since I did love it so much in the beging, I did get the exact same one and I figure I can always take it back again if I need to."
4,Fisher-Price Monitor,Overall it is a good monitor. It is very sensitive and picks up the lightest sound. I can hear my baby every move. I can even hear the TV in the next room through the monitor. The only negative about the monitor is that you can hear a little static. The static irritates me when I am trying to sleep. But the static doesn't interfere with the reception. I would still recommend this monitor as a good buy.
2,not as good as I thought,after reading some reviews I thought this would be a good monitor. but the problem is the static. the only way not to hear the static is if you lower the volume to the lowest. I'll be returning it and might try a cheaper model.
4,very clear,I am impressed with the quality of this monitor. I can hear every breath my baby takes and my bedroom is on the opposite side of the house. I can put the monitor on vibrate if I want instead of the sound or both. I can go out in my garden with the monitor because you can use batteries (which is very convient). It is a good product.
2,Doesn't last long,"This monitor worked really well for about six months. I could hear my daughter breathing, I could hear traffic go by outside her window, and I could hear the echo of my husband and I laughing from our living room! It was great because it made me feel really safe - but after about siz months, I was unable to unplug it. If I wanted to take it to another room with me, as soon as I would unplug it, it would stop working. if you slammed it with the palm of your hand, the sound would come in and out... Now it doesn't even do that. If I dont' have this thing plugged it, it does not work. So, I am not able to leave the room that I am plugged into. Which pretty much defeats the whole purpose of having a baby monitor with such a wide range and rechargeable batteries. This thing is pretty much worthless to me now. I'm shopping around for a new one that will allow me to actually walk around my house. I'm very disappointed because I can't get my money back on this junk."
2,Lasted 6 months,"I used this monitor for 6 months, liked the reception when far away from the nursery (but not when too close!), and then it stopped recharging. Thinking it was the battery, I searched 4 stores and finally had a battery store MAKE me a replacement battery.... Only to find out that it still would not keep its charge. Fisher Price no longer makes this unit, and will send me $40 in coupons for me to buy another one... in 6 weeks!!"
5,this product is great,This product comes in very handy it picks up all of the sounds that your babby mackes
1,Same problems as other posters,"We have had this monotor for 2 years. It worked great at first. After about a year, the battery degraded. It now will last for about 10 seconds on a charge unless it is plugged in.We also have the crackling issue. If you try to adjust the volume, you have to play with it so that it gets the right volume without the white noise. The only way to turn the unit off is with the volume control, so you will eventually wear this part out.I have read others purchasing a replacement battery for $11 to $15. That is nuts. You can buy a new monitor system for $35. Why put 50% of the cost into maintenance of the battery. You will probably havef to buy another one in a year anyway.Bottom line, this unit will not last much more than a year, so be prepared to spend more money later, or ween yourself off the monitor."
1,Good for a short while,This monitor performed great the only problem was that it performed great for ~1 year. Now every time you try to change the volume it does an abnoxious crackling noise. Needless to say I am on the hunt for another monitor. I would not recomend this monitor to anyone.GA
1,I wouldn't buy this monitor,"This monitor only worked well for about 6 months. Now every time we turn it on or turn the volume up or down it crackles really loudly, which is awful when my husband is sleeping and I have to turn it on and off to go to my baby. I expected it to last a lot longer, but now we have to buy another one. We tried cleaning the inside and nothing helps."
2,"worked great, then died","I loved this monitor at first. I could even hear my baby breath at night (which helps any new mother sleep better) After about four months the lights quit working, then within a week it stopped working all together. The bad part was my baby was napping when it broke and I never heard her crying when she got up. Good monitor if you plan on using it only a short time."
3,Use it first or not at all,We have a monitor that has a voice activation mode. It was 900 mhz so we thougt it would be perfect for outside. well the darn thing doesn't pick up like we like and we get really frustrated with it when we are up and moving with it. So we bought this monitor. It is 900 mhz and it vibrates. We thought that would be cool out by the pool. Well there is so much dead white noise that comes out of it there is no way to sleep with it. There is no voice activation like we like. We took it back. We may have liked it better had we not been spoiled already by the other. Now we would rather complain about the other monitor beeping as opposed to this monitor's static.
5,must must read,"This is an amazing read. Susie Lloyd is hilarious and honest. I recommend this book to any Catholic, homeschooler, mother, or human being. God bless the Lloyd family and all who read her books!!!!"
2,Didn't finish it...,"My wonderful hubby brought this home from a retreat at Steubenville University for me. He usually picks exceptional books for me and I very much look forward to reading his seletions, but this one was a flop. I read the first few chapters and realized I was not finding it funny. So, I skipped ahead and read a few more... I still did not find it funny.I found the humor to be a combination of whine and slap stick - neither of which I appreciate.Sorry, I really wanted it to be funny.All the best to you!"
4,"Ah, I've been there...!","Even though I don't have five girls like the author of this book, I can relate to so much of what she describes. I really enjoyed the chapter on Home Improvement, where she bemoans having a husband who is great at Catholic apologetics but takes forever to get around to refinishing the kitchen cabinets, coming up with delay after delay .... ""Finally, I produce a contract signed in blood..."" Ha! The other stories, about her addiction to rock n'roll and her daydreaming about changing her supervan for a sports car were honest moments I think every other Gen X homeschooling mom could relate to. I truly enjoyed this book, and hope there's more coming from Susie Lloyd!"
1,Flee this Book,"This is the sort of book that gives art history--especially the ""new"" art history--a black name. Most of the articles are written in deliberately inpenetrable prose, always hiding the the most inept questions and comments (i.e., ""Did Manet really intend to paint the mirror that way?"") Only Griselda Pollock's article shows any sign of intelligence. Another title for this book: ""12 Ways to Kill any Interest in a Work of Art."""
2,sizes run big,sizes run big so if you are a medium order a small. dont feel like returning will just give it to someone bigger i guess.
1,yuck,"scratchy, stiff fabric that did not get better after washing and using softener, i used it as a rag - i forgot that sometimes you get exactly what you pay for"
1,Terrible,"The tanks look nothing like the picture, The arm holes are big and sagging. I bought a bigger size because I ordered a Medium in the same thing and they were tight in the chest and normally I would wear a ladies small."
1,Highway Robbery!,"I purchased one of these two years ago and loved it. However, I bought mine for $20.00. A $100 screwdriver? No, a $100 rip off. I guess Amazon doesn't do any research on its resellers. Caveat emptor."
4,Glimpses into a more wholistic incorporation of faith in one's life,"Fascinating glimpses into a different time and world where faith was integral to the whole of living. While peering into the Celtic Christian world, I am encouraged to reconsider how I integrate my faith into the warp and woof of my life. Quite an enjoyable trip!"
3,A solid read,"This book is worth reading for beginners and intermediate students of the piano. For the advanced student, it should be relatively basic. It is very well organized, and presents many fundamentals of piano technique. My biggest problem with the book is that it is a little dry, i.e. does not really inspire. For that, turn to Neuhaus and Bernstein. I also strongly disagree with the concept of the 'hand drop' technique (by pure gravity alone). This is nonsense, nobody plays like that, although they might THINK that they do - which is altogether something different!"
2,"Informative, but supplement this study.","Even if you found that this book has been helpful to you, I strongly suggest the following additional books:""Attention and Motor Skill Learning"" by Gabriele Wulf ...Experiments show that focus on results (external focus) are more effective than focus on one's own body movements (external focus) I strongly suggest reading this book, especially for those who have found that the Sandor book has not helped them.""The Art of Piano Playing - a Scientific Approach"" by George Kochevitsky (repeatedly contradicts the falling arm practice technique)Remember that learning how to walk and talk did not require knowledge of what and how the body was doing it.We all have different learning styles and the Sandor book was not helpful to me. Others may also need alternatives. It is also important to find the right piano instructor.(Both books are available on Amazon)"
3,Not such a great value,This book with picture is overpriced for what it is. the picture is so small that is inserted and is reversed in some scenes.
1,Oh ~ this was awesomely B - A -D...,"You wanna watch a real version of 'The Rose of Versaille', I highly recommend the animated version instead. I'm just so glad that this film was uploaded on YouTube, both in English and Spanish. The story depicts semi-factual events about the French Revolution, but not as accurately as the animated film version of this story.Save your bucks on this one and log into YouTube. You won't regret it."
2,A weak and ill-focused effort,The prose is indifferent and so are the situations. There's no ups or downs to the text--it's all a monotone. Cley is no longer a credible character. I think Ford was tired of the world he had created and will be much better off when he moves on to other things.
5,Very high quality faucet for a great price!,"We were too cheap to pay $106.00 for a widespread faucet at our local home improvement store - and that was for an icky rental-qrade looking one! We were a little hesitant to order this, first because the price was so low, second because there were no reviews, and third because the order was not fulfilled by Amazon.We are so glad we took the risk - the quality of this faucet is amazing and everyone loves it! The metal is very heavy and lends itself well to looking like a $300 dollar set. The photos really do not do it justice - much more attractive coming out of the box. Easy to install, easy to clean, and the delivery was very quick!"
1,This is not a data cable for HTC Touch Pro,"I first went to HTC's website but $30 for a cable seemed like a rip off so clearly I turned to Amazon. I ordered this cable just to have a spare replacement in case I ever lose the one and only cable that came with the phone.Those that have HTC Touch Pro know that the phone end of the cable is not symmetrical. Rather the little notch is only on the right while the left side of the connector is flat. The cable these guys sell is a REGULAR USB cable, not one for the phone.Obviously if it costs $3 and $3 for shipping most people (myself included) will not bother sending it back once they realize they bought an ordinary USB cable, and I'm assuming that's what these guys are banking on."
1,NO HTC TD2 USB data cable!,this is a USB to mini USB cable NOT equivalent to an original HTC TD2 USB data cable!HTC TD2 has a special plug - a mini USB does not really fit and is not recommended to use!
4,Many lows but lots of compensatory highs,"I don't know how I got into JA's music. I think I read a review of a concert she gave in Dallas back in 1995, and in the body of the review the writer listed some of Joan's song titles, and the titles, themselves, intrigued me. I went out and bought her then new CD, The Shouting Stage, and thought it was really horrible. Fast forward to last year when I somewhat capriciously decided to pick up her one disc greatest hits CD. I instantly fell in love with how unique some of the songs such as Cool Blue Stole My Heart, Heaven, and Love and Affection were. This 2 CD set has a lot of songs devoid of any hooks or brilliant lyrics (Simon, How Cruel, Temptation) but it has a lot of great songs that are exclusive to this CD. The track ""I Must Be Going"" is the most brilliant track I have ever heard and only available on CD format here...."
2,Find something else,I waited a long time to provide the review of this product. I am glad other people feel they got some value from this unit. It's heavy and does not work well on household carpet. We purchased a new upright from another brand last month and I cannot describe how much dust it picked in our carpets that had been missed by the Eureka. This product does not get a positive recommendation.
4,"Good, but not for the scholarly Arthurian fans","I enjoyed this book, but this is not something the unswaying Arthurian geek would enjoy as it is not true to the Arthurian canon. Too much has been combined and changed around to make this original.But if you are one that can look past that and just enjoy a great book, like me, then this is for you."
2,Not Best I've read,"I usually like some of the paranormal books but, I did not care for this book at all. The book was way too long and just wasn't good. However I did like the twist between Lancelot and Guinevere."
4,Engaging,"Fetch won't win a prize for great lit. But the book is a great read. It has an intriguing plot, a likable (sometimes) main character and fun setting."
1,Tons of foul language,"I bought this book because I love the Fletch movies, and I had heard that the book was much better than the movie. Within the first few pages the language was as bad as an Eddie Murphy comedy show. I guess I'll just have to stick with the movie."
1,do not buy this,i found myself forcing myself to read this book. it was very boring. when i finished it i was relieved of a heavy burden
3,Challenging Version of a 5 Star Book,"I own a similar version of this book in print, but wanted it on my Kindle. It was obvious from the sample that this version had problems, but I wanted it anyway and it is MUCH better than the free version available elsewhere on line. -- You will come across ""words"" that are not words at all (like the Sword and the Trozel rather than Trowel and glor)"" rather than glory) but generally you can tell what they are supposed to be. Sometimes though, you can't tell and that can be a little disconcerting. For my part, I am enjoying the book despite its flaws and continue to be glad I bought it."
2,Disappointing version of a great book,"I was disappointed in this purchase, because the of the frequent scanning/transcription errors that could have been easily caught and corrected. e.g. AUTOBIOCrLXPHY instead of AUTOBIOGRAPHY, as well as many that are indecipherable. A simple look through the text to correct the more obvious errors should have been done. A table of contents that is linked to the chapters would have been very helpful, as well.The content is great. I just wish I had known it had no linked index, and so many textual errors. I would have shopped around for a better version."
4,Amazing book,I got this bok tolearn more and its so awesome to get a glimpse back into time reading both of their letters to eachother and Susannahs thoughts on it all. The time frame begins when he is about 18 years old. i wish i knew this because I would have gotten a different book that covers his younger years also. Now i have to buy a 2nd book. Love the book but wasnt a fan of the product description. Thats why im giving it a 4/5 stars.
5,Fascinating History Of A Manuscript,"This is advertised as the story of the Voynich Manuscript, a mysterious volume of untranslatable and esoteric notes and drawings which surfaced in 1912. Apparently the work of the famed English medieval scientist Roger Bacon, the Voynich Manuscript has defied every translator and codebreaker.The Goldstones have padded out the story of the manuscript itself (what can there be to say about a manuscript that no one can figure out?) with some fascinating material about Bacon and his contemporaries like Thomas Aquinas, all of whom were active during the 13th century buildup to what later came to be called the European Renaissance.As a result, this book is part mystery, part history, and both parts are fascinating."
3,"Fascinating story, but some theories exceed facts","A fascinating story, and a page turner. However, like another reviewer said, I too had hoped for more information on the manuscript and the attempts to decipher it. I also feel that some of the theories of the authors are not well supported by the information they present."
3,"Good in parts, like the Curate's egg.","This is a wonderfully readable book, and fills in a lot of context about Bacon's times for those who don't know it. However, it has an extraordinary error (sorry, can't give page number as I have this on Kindle) where Henry VII is described as Henry VIII's older brother! Why did no one catch this?? I am 75% of the way through (have yet to get to details of the Voynich MS) and hope not to find egregious mistakes like this one!"
2,Nicely written but doesn't deliver,"There are much better books out there covering these subjects. The biographies of Bacon and John Dee, for instance, are done much better in The First Scientist and The Queen's Conjurer. The authors clearly don't understand Bacon's science (totally misrepresenting his idea of species) and similarly know little about cryptography. Towards the end, in the surprisingly thin section on the Voynich manuscript, they comment that ""no matter how brilliant the mind that fashioned a code, an equally brilliant mind might break it"". This just isn't true - a one time pad may be a pain to use, but it is totally impossible to break, period. A real disappointment."
2,"Routine gangster movie, with little logic","Routine gangster movie, with little logic . . .Two handsome young man fight their way through cunning and murder to the top of the organized hierarchy in the city. There are no surprises and no charm. Crime first pays very well, and then it doesn't, in a sop to the moralists."
5,French Mob film,"I remember this film on TV when I was a kid; however, I have not seen this since then. So I do not remember this story detail, but I remember the fashion of actors were so cool. The end of this film is quite impressed. Anyway, I want to see immediately."
4,This writing book is very easy to read and apply,The concept -- author-agent -- is a good one. The book is well written and anticipates my next question. Worth bringing into your library.
2,advice from the shallow end of the pool.,"This is the sort of book to read quickly as there is much dross. I wasn't that impressed by the examples from well known writers with bits added by Ms Whitcomb , then asked to improve, where we then read the piece in the original. What a cop out- can't she write herself? As for Ms Rittenberg, half the time I felt like I was being battered about the head by a disgruntled teacher, all the while hearing a subtext of ""whatever you do,dont call me as your agent."" The book left me feeling depressed and when it passes I hope to be able to continue my writing."
3,Not the greatest writing book I've ever read,"It's an ok book for someone new to the business that has no idea what they are doing but I felt the book didn't exactly help with the writing process itself besides a few helpful suggestions. The actual writing the novel part is short and vague and not too detailed. Haven't read the book in years though but that's what I remember. If you're thinking about buying this book, I suggest writing for dummies, it tells you absolutely everything you need to know about writing and getting published for a greenie writer and is wayy more helpful."
5,Great Step-by-step Ideas for Writing,This book is a great way for those who are struggling to even get started writing their first novels to sit down and map out the process. It is a step-by-step guide that helps give you ideas and resources about how to go about writing a novel. Be prepared to want to buy some of the recommended books the authors discuss!
3,Mystical translsation?,"After reading through about 20 pages of this book I am confused. The old-fashioned language suggests that this is a reprint from somewhere, but this is not acknowledged, which is uncomforting, as with this sort of text you like to know your source. I don't know how good St Isaac's original Syriac was, but the translation is not up to modern-day standards (I speak as a professional translator) and at times you have to be a pretty professional linguist and theologian to make head or tail of it. Once you hack through the undergrowth, there are some nuggets, as St Isaac is recognised as a great spiritual writer. It is certainly and thankfully outside of the ""spiritual consumerism"" category, and by the same token, perhaps not a book to be read without some feeling for the spiritual context in which St Isaac wrote."
5,Short Chapters and scripture verses,"This is a wonderful book, very easy to read. The chapters are short, but to the point. Scripture verses are featured in each chapter. I'm reading this book with a group of woman as we pray for our High School children. No doubt the Lord brought this book to our leader for a purpose! Many of us feel we are in a spiritual battle as our teens struggle with anxiety, depression and various addictions. This book has been an inspiration and help in times of trouble. I would HIGHLY recommend it!"
5,Absolutely Beautiful,What a beautiful CD! I love this one. Every arrangement is wonderful and very enjoyable. I listen to it almost every Sunday. I highly recommend it.
5,Favorite Documentary on Shirley so far.,A very good documentary on Shirley temple. Interviews with many co stars and people that knew her. Old film clips and pictures that I have never seen before. Recommended.
2,A Supreme Disappointment.,"Despite this film's many fine qualities, I cannot refer to it as a success for the film series. Even when one ignores the fact that no film can ever live up to the book it may be based upon, and that the Prisoner of Azkaban is at least twice the length of the previous two novels; the movie just does not meet the standards set by the previous two movies. To begin, the movie is only about 135mins. in length. This may seem inconsequential at first but please note that each of the other two movies were at least 190mins. in length and ,as I said , the book is twice as long as the other two. This being the case a large amount of the plot was cut as well as crucial information for those in the audience who prefer not to read the books first.My only hope is that somehow they actually filmed many more scenes (or at least a few ) and that these scenes will be available on some sort of Extended Edition DVD a la LOtR because frankly, this movie just does not cut it."
1,Ultimate is edition not extended - avoid!,A shame to see 1300+ reviews with almost all of them glowing when almost none of them reference the Ultimate edition. The Ultimate edition of this movie is NOT extended as 1 & 2 were. If that's why you bought earlier Ultimate editions then stay away from everything after that!
1,Don't buy anything from them.,If you buy something and have to send it back they will keep your money and what you sent back. They got me for almost $90 dollar's and still refuse to send me my money
1,"Terrible sound, one was broken!",Purchased a pair of these. First off each speaker handles both right and left. They hsould mention this in the description better. One was broken and the sound was pretty terrible. I'm probably going to dismantle it and try to wire up other speakers inside since the wiring is already burried and in conduit. I'd stay away. I thought because they were pricey the'd be decent quality..i was wrong.
3,Ashley's really trying to be nice and show Christian love - but what exactly does God expect?,"Weddings stink! Well, not generally but Ashley's wedding is definitely not coming off as planned!How could a celebration of the love and union of two people turn into such a circus? There are only a couple of months until her wedding and she has no dress, no shoes, no location, no photographer, no band, and no money. To be fair, Ashley did have a dress but her sis-in-law-to-be, Emily, cancelled it and replaced it with a Scarlet O'Hara dress. UGH. Emily just can't seem to get that, even though she's been hired as Ashley's wedding coordinator, Ashley makes the decisions. Ashley's the bride. And, Ashley did have the most gorgeous shoes... but her dog Rhett ate them. Grrr. And she did have money, but she gave that to her brother so that he could hold the social event of the year for his in-laws. AARRRHHH!"
4,happy with this,This is a great series & I enjoyed the way the author tied everything up at the end.
2,Total waste of money,"I regret that I bought this whole series all together with high hopes and I was severely disappointed. By this last book, I ended up just scanning through it to get the basic (lame)story line. I mean, I had already bought it so I might as well just see what happened in the end. Terrible, boring, shallow series!!!"
4,"With this Book, I'm Convinced!","Well, Ashley Stockingdale, dog-owner, homeowner, patent attorney and FIANCEE is back in the ending of this fairy tale <or somewhat of one>. Ashley is engaged! To ultra-super hunk Kevin Novak, the doctor! Now, all looks like a fairy tale from the reader's standpoint, but just wait! Enter Emily Novak, Ashley's ""uninvited"" wedding planner. When Emily shows up with her huge Southern Belle wedding dress, Ashley begins to lose it. Planning a wedding is not exactly what Ashley had in mind of fun. Join our heroine in the last installment of the Ashley Stockingdale Series. It is worth the time!"
3,Sliding Into Third,"The third book in the Ashley Stockingdale series was something of a disappointment. There is still the good storytelling and the great dialogue, but missing were the spiritual insights I've come to enjoy so much in the previous books. Our heroine bride is planning a wedding without a groom and virtually no assistance - shouldn't that be the perfect time to rely on God? But no, she pulls away from her church, fails to go to premarital counseling and is distanced from her friends and family. But in the end it all comes together with a happy ending. I was disappointed that the characters seemed to forget their priorities.I'm not totally panning the book - I did enjoy it, but after turning the final page, I was left a bit wanting."
2,an odd one,"Put simply, it's an odd mixture of current fashion, fiance drama, and - get this one - god."
3,heat up -still warm calls,"Heat up your cold calls, still wants warm calls, meaning you must have some connection to the potential client. I did get some ideas out of the book. If you are like me, calling people you do not know, he does not have a lot of suggestions, other than, just don't make cold calls. But wasn't that the title,in the first place."
4,Great ideas of how to change your attitude towards cold calling,I have always hated doing cold calls but I know the importance of doing them. Reading this book has really given me an entirely new outlook on making calls. It teaches you ways to preheat your calls so that they are not cold and miserable. I was really motivated to come in to the office this week to start making lots of calls and growing the sales!!
4,Heat Up Your Cold Calls,I purchased this book at a primer for my sales team but also find value in it for myself. It reminds and reinforces good habits and demonstrates new perspectives to enhance the process of getting appointments and commencing a relationship. The book is of value to new as well as experienced sales people. It is easy to read without being considered elementary. Any sales pro can easily identify with the topics and techniques this book presents. In the vast array of sales skills books I find this one of the best and most efficient in delivering value for the working professional.
5,Insane in the Membrane!!,"This book will blow you away and inspire you!! Even if you are NOT an actor.. it will give you awesome insight into the thinkings and inner workings of today's top actors. As an actor who started in stand-up comedy - I cannot say more positive things about this book... Ivana explains exactly how to do what so many extraordinary actors have done. She really gets behind the mind of the actor and shows you how to conquer any role.A truly MUST READ for any actor - well-known, currently working, or aspiring. I keep it by my bedside at night, and carry it with any script that I am currently working on.I would even say that it's a great book for the screenwriter - for them to realize what goes into an actor's mind to create a role.My Two Cents,THE Tim Coston"
4,ALL comes back with more.,"Percolator is one of those albums that is so appealing in many ways yet still maddening. The first half of the album is great, the middle stinks, but it ends well. This means I'm always programming my CD player so that I don't have to listen to ""Egg Timer"" and ""MO. 63."" Don't let this discourage you; ALL has some great stuff on this album. Egerton's guitar work is fantastic, especially on the opening track. Even better is Scott Reynold's lyrical work. I don't know, it's just the way his voice sounds in songs like ""Nothin'."" The band takes a hard stand against commercial radio on ""Empty,"" and short catchy tunes, especially ""Dot"" and ""Minute"" are good examples of ALL's kind of punk rock. The hateful (well, resentful, anyway) pseudo-ballad ""Breathe"" finishes the set, and it's a song all you mistreated guys will play over and over again. This is not the best ALL album (I'd recommend Mass Nerder or Allroy's Revenge first), but it's definitely a good buy."
4,Nice little power house,"I was skeptical at first, being that this unit was so light weight, until the first time I used it.It took off the lug nuts on a 2008 Crown Vic with no problem!I was disappointed though, when using with the scissor jack, it didn't have the torque to raise the car like previousimpacts I've owned.I works great with the Porter-Cable PTA9 1/2-Inch SAE Deep Impact sockets I purchased!"
1,What a Joke,Do not buy this tool It is gutless My Snapon 3/8 drive has more power. Total disapointment. This is the last time I buy a product based on cust. reviews.
5,Perfect for anyone looking to upgrade their acoustics palet,This book can be a tremendous asset to anyone interested in cleaning up their audio listening invironment. It would be difficult to imagine myself not having this book around now with all the wealth of information it possesses. Highly recomended.
5,Somewhere in the Ocean,"Wonderful pictures and with the hidden numbers my 3yr old great-grandson had to use his skills to find the numbers which he did easily. Loved counting the sea ""creatures"" as he called them and matching it to his puzzle that is the same as the cover."
2,Book needs a major rewrite,"I found this book to be dry and poorly laid out. Examples were often mentioned on one page, but shown on the next. This resulted in having to flip pages back and forth to view code snippets while reading about them. The book is too light on example source code and does not contain any complete programs. The ideas presented by the author are a broad overview. After reading this book, I have no idea about how to really start implementing them.If you are wanting an overview of objects and how they relate to COBOL, read this book. If you are looking for a Step by Step to Sustainable Legacy Systems, then this is not the book for you.In addition the book mentions the author, Robert Levey, is president of Prospect Systems in Nutley, NJ. However, using Google, I could not find a web site (or any information for that matter) for this company."
4,Basic an clearly understandable,"This book covers a wide area of fields necessary for business and economic students. It also explains how to go on if necessary conditions are violated. Time-series analysis, which is very important for economic students, are not covered to the extent as other topics, but it nevertheless gives a good introduction of other statistical concepts necessary for understanding following books on time series analysis. For my opion there are a little bit to much exercises than necessary, for an autodidactic study but enough for class room work. A very fine feature is that there never come up terminologies which has not been discussed before and one can use MS-Excel."
1,"Bold and crazy, but very weak.","Let's start this off by stating that I am NOT a big Jess Franco fan. So, while I did hate this movie, I suspect that the big fan base that Franco has will love this film.Mari-Cookie is good in how simply outrageous it is. There is no attempt to mimic Hollywood. There is no attempt to present this film as anything but crazed low-budget entertainment. It IS low-budget. It IS crazed. But the filmmaking is so lacking in competency and artistry, the end result is anything but entertaining. So, despite the insanity - which I admire - this film falls way short. It was difficult to sit through.DVD - the transfer is okay; not bad, not great. The extras are more entertaining than the actual movie, but not nearly good enough to justify buying this disc. And the menu pages of this DVD are about the most annoying motion menus I've ever been forced to endure.Jess Franco fans, you may love this DVD. To the rest of the world: AVOID!!"
5,WHO MIGHT LIKE THIS CD?,"I purchased this album because of Paul McCandless. In my view he substantially enriches the music of Bela Fleck, so I expected that he would do as much for Oregon. I was not disappointed.Anyone who enjoys both jazz phrasiology and classical music should find this album a great addition to their library. Its more weighty than Claude Bolling's classical-jazz. It's also more lucid and spacious than the orchestral recordings of DiMeola. I plan to purchase more copies of this CD for friends who enjoy the fusion of classical instrumentation and jazz improvization."
5,30 years and they just keep getting better,"I've been a huge Oregon fan since 1972, when the utterly original strains of Distant Hills opened a new window in my prog-rock world. It's been immensely gratifying to see these guys hang in there, growing and continuing to make vital new music. This CD includes arrangements that go all the way back to 1970, but have only now been able to be realized. The wait has been worth it, though -- this album is chock full of great performances of great music. It features three outstanding new Towner tunes and two new McCandless tunes. ""Acis and Galatea"" is especially impressive. It also reprises older gems, like ""Zephyr,"" in new settings. The band integrates naturally with the orchestra -- none of the syncopation or swing is lost, which may be a unique accomplishment. I hope this recording makes lots of money, so we can see this band in the U.S. again. How can so much talent and accomplishment fail to be appreciated here?"
5,Magnificent!,"This is how Oregon should be heard. A favorite group for many years, this production is simply stellar in scope and sound, far exceeding my expectation. Not to diminish Mark Walker's contribution as a percussionist, but I wish that Collin Walcott were still here to be part of this production."
3,New Orleans Mourning,"This was a difficult book for me to get into. Not sure if it was due to trying to keep up with all the characters and almost had to make you think each time they mentioned one. In the end it was ok, but I didn't get lost in it."
4,New orleans thriller,"I enjoyed this book. It kept you guessing as to the killer. It made New Orleans come alive for me again. I had visited so many of the places mentioned, so I thoroughly enjoyed this thriller."
4,New Orleans Noir,Involved noir mystery pulls you in with darkly eccentric characters. These defined with in~depth explanations of unique New Orleans social mores. The book`s background setting is richly diverse; famous and infamous. outlandish and mundane.
2,Ok,"The first couple of chapters were hard to follow. I had to reread the characters a couple of times to figure out who was who. The book was free so it was okay. I wouldn't recommend it, if you have to pay for it. The ending was predictable and the characters too many to keep up with. The New Orleans history was fine but other than that it was a no go for me!"
3,Something did not grab me,"I do not know, just I will not read one of her Skip langdon books again. It just did not leave me wanting more"
1,Ghastly,"Good Gawd, what a boor! Couldn't even make it past the first chapter it was so bad. Rated it one star only because that's as low as you can go. Not even worth the 99 cents."
2,"Convoluted, overhyped mess.","Though Julie Smith does give an invaluable lesson in the minutae of New Orleans social structure, perhaps she should have written a guide book rather than this mess.Skip Langdon, as our intrepid protagonist is almost likable. One is intrigued by her stature, her outsider status both professionally and personally and her personal history. However, Smith's creation seems to make so many mistakes and have such poor judgement that at times her low esteem seems justified. Her constant jealousies are distracting and in the end prove to be extraneous.The multiple points of view add nothing to the plot nor the mood, and when the POV is not Skip's the story's momentum comes to a standstill. The story is full of sidelines and subplots which are then dropped and never brought to conclusion.The final nail in the coffin for me was the two dimensional, not to mention offensively stereotypical depiction of homosexuals.I'm trully surprised this book won any awards let alone the Edgar."
1,New orleans mourning,First book of Julie Smith I have tried to read. I havent finished it. Got bored with so much New Orleans and so little plot. I was looking forward to finding another action writer but was disapointed.
4,The Three Degrees of Glory,I enjoyed the book. It was worth reading. It was a beautiful depicton of the Three Degrees of Glory.It isn't a long book and can be read quickly.
5,AMAZING,"I love this book, its the best ever, the author is amazing, the information is amazing and I always recommend this book to everyone that wants to understand and learn more."
3,Three Degrees of Glory review,"This is a book by a well-known LDS Apostle whom I respect greatly. I find the doctrine in the book very well explained and doctrinely correct. However, I found the structure of the book to be a bit disjointed. The book appears to be a series of extracts from Elder Ballard's talks over several years but without much structure. I would have liked to see chapters and/or sub-headings to give the reader an idea of where he is heading from section to section."
1,Interesting piece of undocumented fiction,"Three degrees of Glory is OK if you believe it at face value. My advice is to read it with an open mind and then go a little further. Try Lyndon Lamborn ""Standing for something more"". I think you'll find it's a bit more comprehensive and leaves the reader feeling smarter."
3,I appreciate his testimony but I didn't enjoy this book as much.,"Although he does quote scriptures this book has a lot of personal opinion and doctrine that to my knowledge isn't official doctrine, hence the word ""personal opinion""I am not saying it was a bad book nor do I intend to offend, I just personally didn't find it that well written or as good as other doctrine books I have read.Something I did come to learn from this book is the importance of doing work for your dead, I am excited to start."
1,Amatuer,"Interesting subject but very poorly written, the author couldnt decide if it was to be scholarly or emotional becoming neither."
2,Nice read about my old neighborhood,I grew up in the Youngstown area back in the 50's. My Father worked in the offices of Republic Steel and took an early retirement years before Black Friday. I remember my Grandmother sweeping mill cinders from the front porch every morning when the mills were operating and how the flames from the stacks would light up the night.The book gives a good account of the people and life styles of those that worked in the mill. It is sad that Youngstown never recovered.
4,Buy it if you are into collecting Simpsons stuff,"I'm not an UNO fan, but I love the Simpsons Show, so I ordered this just because I'm starting a collection.[...]This version itself is a little different that the original one, it's supposed to be played in rounds, it comes with less +4 and +2 cards which makes it faster -good idea- If you don't agree with the new rules you can easily modify them or play the game as usual.This game introduces a new type of card -The Witchcraft- but I still think the images are the best."
2,Utterly gratuitous,"The characters in this story serve no purpose other than to fill up the usual Black Lace required scenes: BDSM from both sides, male-male, female-female, etc. There are some extras in there, and the sex is all very hot, but the plot is thinner than sub-atomic particles, and the characters could be cardboard cut-outs for all the reader would notice. With the possible exception of the actress and the orderly, who do develop a relationship and show some concern and tenderness in their encounters, all of the sex in this book is just a roller coaster ride of graphic shocks and erotic-boardering-on-bizarre encounters. If that is what you are looking for, do buy this book, you'll enjoy it immensely. If you are looking for plot, however, skip this one."
4,4 Hearts from TRS!,"""For those who enjoy eroticism on every page this book is for you. It's not for the squeamish as the domination and submission activities become very explicit. There's a good mystery woven throughout the sexual activity that keeps the book from becoming just another fantasy novel. Ms. Ashford pulls out all the stops to make this very sexual and pens a good suspense novel at the same time."" Dee Dailey"
1,"Cheesy, boring, ridiculous...","I had neither the desire nor the inclination to finish up this book. The plot is cheesy, the story is boring and the sex scenes are cheap and useless. The story of a young doctor who discovers that the new private hospital she works for is also a place where people go to seek pleasure intrigued me at first. However, this book and its erotic scenes read like a tacky, low-budget porn film. The BDSM scenes are especially ridiculous. I like erotica that awakens my intellect as well as my senses. Deanna Ashford has disappointed me with this book. She did a great job with Wild Kingdom, but this one misses the mark in more ways than one. Black Lace has let me down again. I hope that the next Black Lace book I read will be something like Menage, Wild Kingdom, The Tutor or The Captivation."
4,Doctor's orders,"A Black lace series book. Helen Dawson is a dedicated doctor who has taken a short-term assingnment at an exclusive private hospital which cateers for every need of its rich and famous clients. The Matron, Sandra Pope, ensures this includes their most curious sexual fancies. When Helen forms a risky affair with a famous actor, she is drawn deeper into the hedonistic lifestyle of the clinic. But will she risk her own privileges when she uncovers the dubious activies of Sandra and her team?"
4,Doctor's Orders,"I really enjoyed this novel. It had great sex scenes, but also a good story to keep you interested. The characters were well developed and the plot made sense. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys erotic fiction."
5,"Great, but WATCH OUT!","This is an excellent product, as are most of the Midnight setting roleplaying products.However, if you want to start using this setting, most of this product has been incorporated into the Midnight Campaign setting second edition core book.Midnight, Second EditionJust a heads' up so you don't waste money and end up buying the same product twice."
2,Don't judge Rankin by this novel,"If this is your first Ian Rankin book, forget it as fast as you can, and run quickly to one of his wonderful Rebus books. They are as good as this one is hollow. First one must swallow the coincidence that a US pharmaceutical/chemical company hires a former SAS companion and enemy of our hero to do their dirty work. After that, when trouble erupts for Bro. Reeve, our hero, he gets on Interpol's list of wanted folk. But still he is able to fly back and forth from US to Heathrow at will, pass through immigration and customs, without as much trouble as a US tourist heading to Cancun. So much for Interpol. Under all this is the pasty treatment of our hero's wife and son. This novel is something like the computer games Bro. Reeve's son Allan plays continually. So please, don't judge Rankin by this one. He's really a good writer, who must have felt the need for some extra cash by churning out BLOOD HUNT."
3,Disappointing,"I am a big fan of the Rebus series, and was looking forward to this earlier work by Ian Rankin. While the subject matter of Mad Cow Disease is still relevant, the novel was a rehash of Big Bad American corporations looking out for the bottom line at the expense of millions of lives. It is certainly true that corporations have their eye on their bottom line and we certainly have evidence at how far they go to protect it (ie Enron), but I think they stop short of murder. If this British author had used, let's say a British company, it would have come across less as America bashing and more like a standard crime novel. It wasn't horrible and at times I was even entertained, but I expected so much more."
2,An early Rankin not worth the time,"Former soldier Gordon Reeve flies to California to claim the body of his brother Jim, an apparent suicide. But it soon becomes obvious that the facts aren't fitting together and that Jim's death was murder.In spite of three attempts, I just could not get into this book. I will admit I'm not a big fan of conspiracy themes but, that aside, I didn't find the character interesting or the plot compelling. For me, this was a Rankin practice book until he started writing Rebus."
2,"Slainte, Rankin! But This One Just Didn't Grab Me","My first foray into non-Rebus Rankin (Jack Harvey, whatever) left me with an understanding of why authors might use alternate names for their earlier, less-stimulating projects. ""Blood Hunt"" has some elements that kept me entertained, but they seemed to wane as I worked my way through the 500 pages. The bad guy, Jay, seems to hold a kind of silly grudge from his SAS experience in the Falklands War while on an operation with main character Gordon Reeve. There is also the story of a highly provocative cover-up involving BSE (Mad Cow Disease) and a murdered journalist/brother that is never brought to a close. Too much, really. Reeve is definitely cool, but he doesn't come off as a sympathetic or fully drawn character. Note: I absolutely love the Rebus series, but I don't feel inclined to pick up the other remaining Jack Harvey-penned novels. Hope I'm not missing something, but ""Blood Hunt"" has done nothing but cool mine a little. Ouch. Sorry, Ian."
2,"Well written, but predictable.","Well written, but not particularly distiguished. No huge surprises or unexpected plot twists."
2,"Ultimately, a letdown","I gave this book a try after reading 'The Falls', my first exposure to the Rebus series. I was interested in seeing how Rankin would approach a standalone novel. I had high hopes for 'Blood Hunt', but it got bogged down by too many 'conspiracy thriller' cliches. Even worse, most of what we're told throughout t he book is almost swept under the rug at the end.This book was a little too 'Andy McNab' for my taste.Presumably, the raction to this book is typical to that for other 'Jack Harvey' titles. It looks like Rankin should stick with his own name, and his best-known character."

2,dispoionting,"I ordered this ppv and it was quite dissapointing if your going to buy this dvd it get it for the elimination chamber match, the only good match of the night. Of coarse I was in a horrible mood because of Lita loosing her title and tearing her acl :( but the matches wernt all that great."
4,This was a great PPV,"With the main event being a elimination chamber and the huge Kane vs Snitsky match this was what pulled it together. Alot of things happened besides these two great matches but overall the Kane Snitsky match was the best. Kane returned as face the Raw before that and made it clear he isn't going to take Snitskys crap and at NYR he proved it by beating the holy hell out of Snitsky. Snitsky had nothing on Kane in this match and everything he did Kane would just sit right back up. In the end Kane did something he never does and pulled of a Tombstone. The reason I gave it 4 stars was Lita lost the title, HHH won the main event and heavyweight title and Snitsky sucks with going along with moves the Tombstone looked deformed with Snitsky not even pulling his legs together and letting them dangle put him out though."
1,bad !! except best ever cell match !,it sucked more than it ever sucked before lol yeah more than judgment Day 2004 or American bash LMAO which is hard !bad matches bad injuries bad presentationEXCELLENT Chamber elimination match
4,New Years Revolution,"World Tag Title matchChristian & Tomko vs. Regal and Eugene-A decent opener, nothing special, just a regular match. 6/10Women's Title MatchTrish vs. Lita-I don't like women matches because as always, the stink. Survivor Series was better. 3/10IC TitleBenjamin vs. Maven-Worse than I expected, Maven didn't even fight, and there was a lot of trash talking. Sort of entertaining. 6.5/10Jerry Lawler vs. Muhammad Hassan-Snoser. Very slow paced because Lawler stinks as a wrestler. Put Muhammad in better matches, he has potential. 5/10Kane vs. Gene Snitsky-Great match with a lot of cool moves between this two monsters. Even though Taboo Tuesday was better this still was a great match. Second best of the night. 9/10Elimination Chamber for the Heavyweight TitleRandy Orton vs. Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit vs. Batista vs. Edge vs. Triple H-Spectacular match. Second best Elimination Chamber. This is why you want this DVD. Cool moves, Batista and Triple H rock. 10/10"

1,New Year's flop,"I THINK WWE'S NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION IN 2005 SHOULD HAVE BEEN TO PUT TOGETHER A BETTER NEW YEAR'S REVOLUTION. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ALL THE GOOD TALENT IS PUT IN ONE MATCH? A HORRIBLE AND WEAK UNDERCARD. THE ELIMINATION CHAMBER MATCH WAS PRETTY GOOD, BUT ALL THE MATCHES PRECEDING IT WERE AWFUL. THE FANS IN PUERTO RICO DESERVED TO SEE A BETTER OVERALL SHOW. DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS ONE. IN RECENT YEARS, WWE HAS HAD HITS AND MISSES WITH PPVS. THIS ONE IS A DEFINITE MISS. THE ONE STAR IS FOR THE GOOD MAIN EVENT."
5,John Cena is indeed a fag!,"Yes John Cena is indeed a fag.He should rap or something because he sure as he** cant wrestle,but anywho I hope Shawn Michaels wins the WWE title.D*mmit Vince Shawn has been back in the WWE for the last four years and still you wont make him champ.Your dumb a** needs to get your head straight and make Shawn the d*mn champ 4 real homie!"
1,This PPV suck's ass,"Every match was bad. They should have the PPV renamed or don'thave it at all. I think Vince McManhon should replace Eric Bishoff as GM of RAW and put Shane'o' Mac or ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin"
2,reviewer below stop complaining!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,New years revolution 2005 gets 2 stars but 2006 gets 5 stars.I am sick of u reviewers complaining about cena and batista being champs. reviewer below ur the i***t if u hate wwe so much why dont u stop watching it. id like to see u tryin to wrestle.

3,Kinda Unusual,"This was kinda a unusual Raw PPV, not like the others here are the matches.Rating out 41)Eugene/Regal vs Christian/Tomko World Tag Titlethis was a pretty good opener, but not realy PPV material **2)Shelton Benjamin vs Maven I.C Titlethis would of been a great match but Maven had to be a bitch, but entertainng moments, bue still..... *1/23)Lita vs Trish Women's Titlewat the hell is this, Lita wins the title, finally, and gets injured again and loses it, to Trish, this wasnt even a match, she got injured like 2 min after the bell rang *1/24)Muhammed Hasan vs Jerry The King Lawlerpretty slow match up and kinda boring *1/25)Kane vs Gene Sniskygood match up, finally, and great build up's **1/26)Elimination Chamber World Heavyweight ChampionshipHHH Special Guest Ref: Shawn MichaelsY2JEdgeRandy OrtonChris BenoitBatistaawesome match and alot of hard hitting and blood, but crappy ending. ***So wat im saying The main event saved the showOverall:Average PPV"

2,So much potential but fate messed it up,"Elimination Chamber was great, but of course, the predictable ending. Lita vs Trish and the Tag Title matches ended up very sucky but it wasn't their fault. What happened was that some unexpected (real life) injuries came into play early on in these matches. The superstars tried their best to keep things going, however, you still knew that Lita and Eugene were going to be gone from in ring competition for a long time and so you couldn't help but feel really bummed out for the rest of the event."
4,GOOD WAR FILM!!!!!,"This is a quite good WWII film from P.R.C. The Alpha print looks good, but the soundtrack dialogue is often interrupted by splices."
2,"The notes are there, but....","I have to agree with the other reviewer. After Stephen Prutsman's fresh and lively performances of these concertos, Tanyel's came as a shock. The timings are about the same, but I see no special insights into these works. I really like her playing of the 2nd modern suite, however. There just needs to be more sparkle, and in the 1st concerto, more verve and forward motion. But even Prutsman and Tanyel cannot beat Van Cliburn in one of his most exciting performances. For a great sample of Tanyel's art, please listen to her Scharwenka concertos 2 and 3 plus his solo piano music. She finds just the right balance between gravitas and fantasy, which is just what her interpretations of the MacDowell concertos need."
1,Ugh!,"If you're into hidebound interpretations coupled with a large dose of lethargy (poorly) camouflaged as ""profound meaning,"" this is the recording for you.But you don't really want that, do you? So avoid this CD at all costs.This recording's outclassed just about everywhere -- even by ones that are priced significantly lower than Hyperion's premium import cost. In Concerto #1, you can do much better with Eugene List or Stephen Prutsman. In Concerto #2, there are many more readings to choose from, and you can pick any number of them and do better than this. Earl Wild is about as good as it gets in this score.I love conductor Martyn Brabbins' musicianship, but even he can't rescue this pitiful enterprise -- a rare dud in Hyperion's otherwise exemplary Romantic Piano Concerto series."
4,So Helpful!,"What can I say? This book is simply wonderful! Although it has no photos (hence the 4 out of 5 stars), it does have in-depth instructions, tips and background information on all its recipes. I don't own this book (yet), but I did check it out from my high school library years ago for a Sociology project. I had never even TASTED Indian cooking, let alone prepare it, but this book made it possible."
5,A winner,"I really enjoy cooking, but used to only cook Mexican and Italian dishes. I had my first taste of authentic Indian food about 5 years ago and have been hooked since then. I wanted to try to make some on my own, and after looking at reviews for this book and Madhur Jaffrey's ""Indian Cooking"", I decided on this one. I have not been disappointed!So far, I have made almost all the vegetable recipes and pilafs and about half the meat dishes. Everything I have made has turned out amazing. The recipes are easy to follow and I like that she offers advice for what dishes to serve together.A word of advice though, be sure to read the recipe first before you go about making it. Sometimes you will be instructed to add hot water or a garnish and it is not listed in the ingredients. Follow the directions and you will be eating good!"
1,Clearly overrated,"I bought this book after reading its review, they were all so wonderful. I love Indian food. I love to cook and I have been in India several times. I got this book hoping it would give me an easily available reference, but I have had the book for over a year now and I have not made a single dish from it. It's not attractive, there are no color pictures and lack structure of any sort; However, other books such as ""Indian, deliciously authentic dishes"" by Shehzad Husain & Rafi Fernandez and Madhur Jaffrey's books give a far deeper view of Indian cooking. This book is very basic and I'd say that on average the level of difficulty for most recipes is not worth the effort. I would never recommend this book!"
5,Among the Classics,"Classic Indian Cooking has been a staple reference in my kitchen for years. I rate it among my top 5, along with the classic Julia Childs and out-of-print Gourmet set. It is informative, concise, and clearly written. All of the recipes are successful if they are followed exactly, and the flavors are a delight to the most demanding eater. This is one of the few cookbooks that can be used successfully even if you haven't tasted Indian food before. I strongly recommend purchasing it."
4,a professional lesson,"I liked all of these DVDs. They really teach you hand on techniques to use in a fight. It's no mumbo jumbo, its the real deal. Adam, the instructor is a very interesting instructor and explains the moves with great detail. These DVDs are a little pricey but sure do teach you a lot. If you are a big fan of UFC you will be sure to enjoy this whole collection."
5,SLAMMING,"These guys not only advance Fela's legacy creatively, they blow up the party. Try it, guaranteed you'll have some very happy feet."
5,excelet sound of te unpluged urban jungle,"excelent mixer of textures sounds and influencies that make grat band, or realy, a most dramaticla expresion of the american contemporary folk music...."
5,Funky,"I saw these guys here in Philly (Philadelphia PA) at The North Star Bar and bought bought their CD right after the show.If your into acid jazz or straight funk your going to like this alot.This band has that new age, old school funk, jazz vibe.Check them out."
4,Great music....naive political message,"These guys need to stick to creating great groove music, and stay away from politics. In the cd cover the band members state: ""We let de-humanising, corrupt insitutions like governments, armies, and banks dictate how we live and die. We try to find joy and fulfillment in the excrement of these institutions: TV, fashion, professional sports.."" What army ever produced fashions, and what govt. agency produces TV shows? Why isn't music included? These guys are obviously talented, but they need to bone up on some basic history and take a look around - don't they know that the new establishment producing the things they hate are CEO's of big communication companies."
3,Exelente Novela,Silvia Navarro es simplemente una de las mejores actrises que tiene mexico! La novela es bonita...solo que el final no me gusta!
5,Peace Within,"The cd ""Before The Day Breaks"" allows one to just be still and melt into the music. A wonderful de-stresser. I find it beautiful to listen to while I cross stitch or when I go to bed. Just what the soul needs."
5,A must for fans,"If you are a fan of the Cocteau's Moon and the Melodies, you will enjoy this continuation. Sure, Budd and Guthrie have both had many stylistic changes over the years, and have experimented with various mutations, but there's no denying that when they collaborate, as on MM, something beautiful happens. Fans and newcomers will not be disappointed."
2,"TREADING, MILLING","Amazing how little has changed in either style or substance since ""The Moon and the Melodies"". While the work here is pretty (not beautiful) it is also familiar beyond formula and sentimental beyond any and all reasonable assessment. If nothing else, this release and its nocturnal twin prove that the single, most profound collaboration of Harold Budd's remarkable corpus remains the still unique and compelling ""Through the Hill"" with Andy Partridge. If you don't have ""Through the Hill"", get it instead of this. If you do have ""Through the Hill"", play it instead of this."
3,Harold Budd's Before the Day Breaks,"Having heard his work with Brian Eno, which was superlative, this was disappointing & often mundane."
3,Color not as shown,"I just received this faucet and was surprised that the color as depicted in the picture was quite different from the actual product. I was expecting the typical oil-rubbed bronze color (very dark brown) which would match my other accessories, however this Danze oil-rubbed bronze is closer to what I would call an antique copper. It has very obvious rosy highlights. Fine if thats what you like, but it will not match other oil-rubbed bronze accessories. I have not installed it yet as I will likely exchange it for the black finish. The faucet otherwise seems well made, but as another reviewer mentioned, be sure you have enough clearance for the stopper lever which angles back toward the backsplash when you engage it. I questioned the manufacturer about the clearance needed, they didn't know and have not yet gotten back to me about this."
1,A Feeble Try,"I expected these guys to put up a great show now that they are adults, but they were a shadow of their former selves. In any case I think only 1 or 2 of them are from the Original Musical Youth Band!"
3,"Very Nice Collection of Trance Chill, Trip Hop & Bossa",It's not really what you'd expect - it's not just a collection of high-nrg trance tracks that you might suspect populate a fashion show but shows off a nice range of tracks ranging from trance chill to pop trip hop to bossa to classic house.Nothing amazing but a solid collection of tasteful tracks.
3,its ok.,I thought it was information that I already knew. I'm always on the lookout for a good deal or something free for my class so I have hit a lot of the deals.
3,Not worth buying.,This book has a few good ideas... but completely not what I was expecting. The content of the book really does not fit the title.
5,Ravishing Disunities,"This is a wonderful anthology with an informative Preface. The selections include poets who play with the form, who create astonishing ghazals that are recognizable as belonging to the form, and at the same time, deviate from the strict definition. Agha Shahid Ali is the leading writer of this form in America. He has selected some of the best ghazals for this anthology.Even readers who are not poets will be tempted to write their own ghazal."
2,not really ghazals,"in the classic way of english writers who decide to tackle foriegn forms, this book cops out on presenting ""real"" ghazals in english. instead what we have are a collection of poems that could possibly be called ""psuedo-ghazals"" ...the ghazal is a very beautiful and intricate form from an extremely rich culture and history; it should be respected as thus. this book, just from looking at the sample pages, shows me that this form has not been respected by its editor. ghazals have been written in english that can, in fact, be called ghazals and that conform to its highly rigid forms; the three ghazals presented in the samples do not show me a book that has attempted to find or solicit these ghazals or their authors.if shahid should put together another book of ghazals in english, it is my hope more time will be spent compiling real examples of the ghazal form..."
5,one of the bettter if not best of the earlier-mid Carlin recordings!,"I just took a ride and gave this new release a listen and thankfully its an old release to me...and one of his best. I'm really glad they pulled this tape out of the vault , dusted it off and put out the CD..as some of my favorite bits of his pre-political stuff are on here. Of course you have Baseball/football (which you can find elsewhere) but the long rant on driving was always a favorite of mine and I'm thrilled to have it again! It is an adult only experience but does predate his attacks of a political nature so those (not me) who are put off by that more recent approach need not worry...this is mostly his better observational stuff..and its really a hoot!"
2,Good techniques but only 20 minutes long,"Great techniques but because it was only a short 20 minutes long, I can't give it more than 2 stars."
4,Cogent & Profound,"Imagine a documentary film without an axe to grind. Let the camera do the story-telling. That's what Andrew Patterson has accomplished in ""Subtle Voices."" He's not out to tackle the American government, the drug cartels of Columbia, or a leftist group think. Subtle Voices represents a wholistic series of interviews to raise awareness and ask difficult questions about an even more difficult human quagmire in Columbia. Some want a diatribe to support the current Columbian government, others want a sermon against US misguided interventionism. Patterson does not provide either in this poignant documentary. Instead he heightens awareness, provokes mind and conscience, and does so with a cogent and profound collage of Columbian images. Indeed, subtle voices, cries from Columbia."
3,"My son loves this book, but puzzle pieces get loose and...","Right now this is my two-year-old's favorite book.He loves to do the puzzles. He can't quite do them, but I believe that he will develop his fine motor skills thanks to this book and his obsession with it.The ""downside"" to this book is that when the puzzles are taken apart and put together over and over, the pieces loosen up a little bit and then they are continually falling out of the book as you turn the pages. You will be continually putting it back together for your annoyed two-year-old. I started saying to my wife, ""I hate this book!!""This started to drive my wife and I to the brink of madness when I reinforced the sides of the puzzle pieces with clear packing tape. This tightened up the puzzles a bit so they don't fall apart quite so easily.But it's only a temporary fix. Will it hold? Will my family go totally nuts because of this book, or will my two-year-old save us all by moving on to something else? Time will tell."
3,"Good Quality, a Few Problems","I was looking for a realistic dinosaur to begin a model collection, and was somewhat disappointed by this Baryonyx. Carnegie is supposed to be a very high quality, realistic line of models, but this specific dinosaur doesn't stand on it's hind legs as shown in the picture, but leans forward and rests on it's front toes. Not only is the Amazon picture misleading, but this is very unrealistic for a theropod who walked on it's hind legs only. After all, he did use the front to snag fish and other prey, and couldn't have done that very well while balanced on it's front legs."
1,Binding fell apart within days...,"Within days of receiving the book (new), the binding split, and the pages are starting to fall out...I have not dropped book...i have nothing bad to say about Amazon though, it arrived quickly. Perhaps the book was mishandled in the warehouse? I plan on trying to exchange it."
2,Holey 'way-too-complex' batman!,The Greenberg text does not speak to student at the level they are at. It starts from the more complex examples and works towards general cases. This only frustrates and confuses the student who wishes only to glean vital information instead of the superfluous fluff that Greenberg offers. There are a ridiculous amount of errors which will hopefully be corrected by the third editon.
1,Not a Book,"I reluctantly rate this one star based only on the quality of the book. It is absurdly massive and flimsily glued together. It is not a book, it is a massive stack of looseley attached paper. After using a few times the back cover is falling off, at which point it can't even be sold. What kind of devious marketing mentality creates a book like this?"
5,The best book in engineering mathematics,"I took two graduate math courses with Dr. Greenberg and I used this book often. However the book was not required as a course textbook , though I know people who bought it just because they considered it a must-have.The book spans a wide range of math topics from ODE, Linear Algebra , Scalar and Vector Field to PDE and Complex Variable. Of course you could always find a more topic-focused book if that's what you're looking for. All the chapters in the book contain representative worked examples chosen from various areas of mechanical engineering. Everything is very well explained in such way that the learning process is optimized and reader time is not wasted.If you are in the field of mechanical engineering you'll probably find this book extremely useful."
3,Did anyone else notice?,"Did anyone else notice that she left out two major writers from her book?John D. MacDonald: author of the Travis McGee series, along with many other mystery - thriller novels and short stories. In the awards section, she does acknowledge that MacDonald won an Edgar in 1972, but there is no mention of him in the index?Same thing for Ross MacDonald: Harper, ""The Drowning Pool"" and many other successful novels, an Edgar in 1974, but again, no mention anywhere in her book?Seriously, how could these two giants of the genre get left out of this book? I bought the thing on a whim, it was pretty cheap used, and it seems well organized and fun to use, but after I noticed these two giant glaring omissions, I feel like giving it to Goodwill."
5,beautiful and versatile,It is so sharp. It is a perfect length in that it can slice most meats and vegetables and works perfectly as a steak knife. It will cut you if you're not careful and you won't feel it until later.
1,"Fragile, Fragile, Fragile...Handle with extreme care...","Purchased this knife about 3 months ago and have used it a handful of times. I was very careful with it while using it, storing it, and washing it. While washing the knife tonight I noticed a HUGE chunk out of the blade...it must have bumped up against a piece of silverware in the sink or something. I'm sorry, I don't care how sharp the knife is or how good it looks--If it is too fragile for every day use, it should be hung on the wall for show and not relied on to actually deal with the stressors of real life. I want a knife that gets the job done, not an ethereal disappointment. This is the first and last time I will own Japanese steel...I should have stuck with the Germans."
5,"Great knife, just a little long","I gave this knife five stars because it is an excellent blade, like all the Shun products. My only complaints would be that, for a paring knife, I think you are better off with the 3.5-inch version. This knife works as a paring knife, but for some of the more delicate paring knife work (like making tomato roses, coring strawberries, stuff like that) the four inch blade is a bit long and cumbersome to work with (and I have frying-pans for hands). Not willing to downgrade the product for that, still an excellent knife, just might be a little too big for an all-around paring knife."
5,Balanced and sharp,"Love this knife. My Henkels is dying a slow death and I haven't been able to get it resharpened properly. This little Shun knife was on sale and I decided that I would risk the buy without ever having held it in my hand and it was worth it! Light but well balanced, I have been slicing my vegetables so incredibly thin, just because I can. I feel like a sushi chef. Anyhow, for regular slicing, this little knife is perfect and great to use.The packaging it came in was overkill but I guess it protects the knife."
5,This Book took my breath away!,"This is a book filled with remarkable, vividly drawn characters and places. Smartly interwoven stories told with such splendid honesty and powerful moments that the reader feels compelled to turn the page. If you miss Aquamarine you have missed a beautifully written story."
5,Fabulous story and prose,"I love this book. Anshaw has such a beautiful prose style - it's unlike any other writer I've read. The story is unique as well - three versions of a life, all instigated by a moment in her late teens. This book is definitely worth every moment spent in its pages!Verge"
2,A waste of time,"This book is on the Planet Out list of the 10 best lesbian novels ever written. My question is, why? I thought it would be an interesting concept to have three different endings for the same story. It wasn't. The middle story isn't bad, but the first and third stories aren't interesting at all. The first one asks you to believe that someone who went to the Olympics and then had a pretty cosmopolitan experience ended up basically barefoot, pregnant and in the kitchen. The third one is even more confusing. And what's with the ending? Which life is it supposed to be? Save your money and don't buy this."
3,Found it interesting,I really liked the whole idea behind the book of what would your life had been like if you had done this instead of that at a certain point in your life. The problem I had with the story was that I didn't get the relationship she had in Mexico City in 1968.
3,Just ok,I didn't find this album to be fantastic. It's all right. It sounds like alot of other albums that have been out for a while; I didn't find it to be terribly original or even all that pleasing to listen to.
5,challenging,"I bought this book to challenge my 4 yr old. She did the first book last year and it was too easy for her. I knew from that experience that she would love it. As the other person said, it has strong colorful pages, it keeps the kids interested. It depends on your child too, if he/she gets frustrated with twisty questions then may be it is not good for you but if they enjoy challenge and using a bit more brain than usual then this book is great. My daughter loves it."
4,Burlesque,"This s an excellent CD of music for burlesque dancing, in fact one of the best ones I have purchased."
4,Probably worth the money,"These products seems to work well. They attach firmly to the Hitachi and remain in place until removed. Removal is not difficult, and clean up is easy enough. They succeed in projecting the massager's power to places otherwise inaccessible."
2,"OK, but nothing special","My girlfriend and I purchased the attachments just to see if the Magic Wand could be any better. Not really. They are tough to slip on and the designs just didn't work well for her. No real benefit and they have since been placed in ""file 13."""
2,Attachments for the wand.,Attachments for the WandMy Wife said it was very uncomfortable and wouldn't use it.I thought she wouldn't enjoy it. She didn't!
2,Cheap material nothing special,Not worth the money or the try. Material is cheap and the wand work great without this stuff. Save yourself some money.
3,Not bad,"What the heck.. try them if you have a magic wand. They give an interesting orgasm when hitting the male g-spot. The curved one does it all, fun with the women too, go ahead.. try it."
3,not bad,"It was a good deal at that price. If you get aggressive with it it will slide off. It's not going to handle a lot of ""pressure"" but it will do the job."
3,It must be a learned skilled,You have to be patient and learn how to use the attachments. Hubby and I have learned they are very different from normal little toys.
1,Sitting in a drawing in my closet...,"In an effort to spice things up in the bedroom, I purchased these 2 attachments with the Hitachi Magic Wand. The Wand is a 5 star product but unfortunately these attachments aren't for everyone. Other reviewers seem to be happy with this product but my girlfriend simply did not enjoy these attachments. Most of my purchases are electronics and I do rarely get a bad apple so Amazon's return policy is great! But with this product I'm embarrassed to return. Can't use this as a paper weight either =/"
1,Inelegant and bulky,"Firstly, I received only one attachment, not two. At the time that I purchased these, the set was sold by Amazon. I received no answer to any of my emails to customer service. After a few months of communicating with a black hole, I gave up.Completely aside from the poor customer service, these attachments are are not aesthetically pleasing in any way. They are physically functional, I guess. However, they are about as sexy-looking as a toilet brush. I have had one for about a year, and I've never used it.Also, they are bulky. Imagine your Hitachi, and how big it is, then look at the photo of this product and imagine that the cup on the end has to fit over the entire head of the Hitachi. The scale has to be big and awkward, in order to fit the wand. So, the whole thing ends up being unwieldy."
3,I am not sure,The G-spotter did get me off but the other one is ok. I am not so sure if G-spotter was good or I was just in the mood. I'll try again.
1,Total Waste,This item was total and complete wast of money....I can't believe that they even put this as some sort of great attachment with the massager...do yourself a favor and save your money..the really sad part is they write this product up like it's this great thing and you of course can't return it for being just stupid plastic head....
2,Looks better in pictures,"Cant speak to how it sounds because I couldnt get past the looks. The cheap plastic chrome stem and shiny braided wire cover dont look good nor real. Also beware this is the non amplified version (NOS8) so dont expect an NOS8A (amplified). It it BIG, but only requires a few inches from the speaker to work properly which should make it easy to install. The retaining straps are black plastic and thin metal."
5,bazooka nos8 nitrous bottle subwoofer,Not cheap but looks great and works well for a subwoofer. Make sure you follow the installation instructions for best bass sounds.
2,"Pretty set, but lacking in quality","The set is very pretty, however, the quality is lacking.My biggest problem has been with the bumper. The seams and ties do not seem to be positioned properly--they do not match up with the four corner posts of the crib railing. I started it in all different corners, different positions on the back railing, and even upside down--and those ties were never in all four corners! So, I ended up removing ties from the toy bag and adding ties to the bumper. Also, once tied, the bumper is VERY flimsy and sags. It looks much better in pictures than in my daughter's crib.The diaper stacker doesn't have any boning or wire edging to help it keeps its shape. It looks a little ragged hanging on the wall."
2,mediocre quality,"Although it's a complete set, it's not worth $129 due to the quality (rough cotton, wrinkled, the quilt frayed and tore after the 1st washing). The pattern does look nice, I only wish it was better constructed with softer materials. I purchased it for my newborn and will need to replace with a nicer set even though it's only been used under 5 weeks."
5,Good quality for a good price,"I purchased this combo set for work. It looks very nice, and should compliment most any system as far as style. The keyboard is very responsive, and all of the quick launch buttons and volume control worked as soon as I plugged the keyboard in, without any need for CD installation. The mouse is also responsive, and comfortable to use. If I find myself needing another keyboard for home or work, I would definitely consider purchasing another, especially for this price."
1,Did *NOT* come with a mouse,"I suppose this is more of a review of Amazon than of the product itself, but FYI - I ordered this, and it came with the keyboard (which seemed to work fine) but NO mouse. I asked for a replacement, and they sent another keyboard WITH NO MOUSE. So now I'm just getting a refund.I don't know if anyone else has had this problem, but all things considered I'd order another product, or better yet order a keyboard and mouse from some place other than Amazon."
5,Great combo,"The keyboard is very comfortable to use. The mouse is nice in terms of moving and clicking, but it does not have two side keys (for back/forward), which are common these days."
4,Good keyb.,"Excellent keyboard for the price, mmm, I give 4 stars because it's a little small than I expected."
4,Thankful,After purchasing this product from another vendor and waiting 3 days to find out they really did not have it after all this company came through. I was worried with the previous bad reviews about not receiving the mouse but everything was included and in perfect order.
3,ANTOnline doesn't provide mouse,"I ordered from ANTOnline and they didn't provide the mouse. After informing them, they said that they only promised the keyboard; and that this was a problem with Amazon. After repeated efforts, I ended up with no mouse. They were not helpful.Keyboard is fine."
2,"Great Keyboard, No Mouse","Well, like another reviewer, I only received the keyboard and not the mouse. When I asked for a replacement, I again received only the keyboard. I guess this is my lesson to learn since I had read that review previously and had just hoped they had resolved the issue. I liked the keyboard though, so I might just buy the keyboard itself. Other than that, you guys should not buy this combo for a while since Amazon is ""currently researching the situation but are unsure when the issue will be resolved. As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than we originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement."""
4,It meets your basic requirements,"Mouse and key board meets your basic requirements.Mouse is bit heavy. But at this price, both are good then other expensive options.I bought this because I prefer wired then wireless, and this is a very rare available these days."
3,It works,"I can't say this is a great keyboard and mouse, the set works fine. It is inexpensive but it also reflects its price. I had a PS2 IBM keyboard that I loved but the quality of this keyboard feels nothing like the IBM. I needed a USB keyboard but I don't believe I should have to spend a lot of money on one.Seriously, keyboards and mice have been around so long you would think the curve would bring the price down anyway. So is the price that great? To be honest, better keyboards are just way too expensive. So in that sense you could say this is a good affordable keyboard."
5,Novel Series,The person to whom I sent this novel was very pleased with both the quality and condition on the book. The four novels were great!
5,Five Stars? Lee Smith is a One-Woman Galaxy!,"What some ""reviewers"" - including those who cannot spell - seem to miss, is the whole point of Lee Smith. In the ""Literary Wrold"", there are storytellers, there are wordsmiths and there are artists. Lee Smith is an artist of the first order and arguably one of the most important voices in American fiction writing today. While I run like a mad woman to buy her work every time a new title of hers appears, I read her stories for pleasure but also for an education. She is a risk taker and in this world of bottom line guarantees to stock holders, it is imperative to support those who take those risks. Read Lee Smith with both eyes, your heat and your mind wide open. Look behind her words, plots, and characters. She isn't to be taken lightly, but to be regarded with great respect. Not only is her work marvelous, she is a marvel. I say, Bravo! Ms. Smith, don't let any of these ignoramouses give you a moment's pause - you just keep up your excellent work!"
4,Good then Bad then Good!,"I started Family Linen and couldn't put it down....then I couldn't pick it up...then I couldn't put it down! I got confused with who was whose parents and while some characters were well developed others were not. When it was good it was very, very good. I'm still not sure who Clinus' father was! But definitely worth reading."
2,Ultimately very disappointing,"I am a big fan of Lee Smith. No author today is capable of bringing the southern family to life the way she does and she does it again in Family Linen. The only problem is that she hangs them out to dry too long. There are all these wonderful characters, each with their own distinct voice and unique story to tell but then nothing really happens. She tries to cover it up by saying small town gossip gets forgotten as soon as there's something new to talk about but it shouldn't work that way in a book. When you've invested a couple of hundred pages in something there should be some kind of payoff. Definitely not her best effort."
1,Glamourization of the filth that so easily besets us,"This novel glorifies sin and filth. It contains adult language and adult content, and raises no theme, except one that tries to cover up the sins of extramarital affairs, and murder... it is a disgrace to any decent author, and should not be read... plain and simple."
4,A very fun book - great characters - surprising,"I enjoyed Family Linen. Though I love southern literature, I generally don't read books about southern ""belles"" but this one was a hoot! Frankly, I wanted more from the original, straight-laced sister who went to a hypnotist beause she was having headaches. I mean, that whole scenario, with her condo, single life, the ""secret"" lurking in her prim head - that was the most compelling aspect of the book. Still, it was very dear and amusing. I recommend it to friends."
4,"Rich ""Southern"" Surprise","Enjoyable treat! My first Lee Smith read, I was very surprised at how rich and satisfying it was, surprised mainly because of the well-meaning but missed-the-point critic blurbs on the cover which prepared me for breezy back-porch southern blarney, an enjoyable genre but not at all accurate for ""Family Linen"". This is tangled Barbara Vine territory, dark family secrets and a mystery that become inscrutable no more, only told in the direct and empathetic voice of an Anne Tyler. With family disfunction that could easily have been rendered as southern-gothic, Smith's story is told with clear-eyed respect for character and for plot development."
2,nice mood song,"This is a nice easy song , but not what you expect as a big comeback song. It is too weak to make up for the scandals. Unfortunately recently all you think when you see Janet is: get dressed please (see album cover too)."
2,How much did I pay for this home video?,"I'm sure Hutch is a real bad dude but his home video of ""basic"" movies is worth maybe 10 dollars at best. His commentary and script seemed thrown together in no real order. Plus, it would be helpfull to know correct ways to punch and stand rather than how to round house someone to the head. Come on now, no REAL person is going to try a kick to someones face. As soon as you do, yo can expect to get bull-dogged to the floor and have your face pounded in. Most people will come at you flailing; swinging wild punches and going for holds and take downs. No offense to Hutch but maybe the basic principles he teaches will help a bit, but it's not really anything phenominal. Save your money folks. I think I am going to try a book to help me improve my fighting next time. Anyone know of some good ones?"
2,Books give you more time and clearer instruction to learn,"Have a look at http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0834804441/002-0312612-5340014?v=glance&n;=283155 or just Google the word ""Hapkido technique book"" OR isbn 0834804441This is just a fantastic book that has step by step illustrations on everything. Starts with philosophy (short & sweet) then starts with the basic stances, punches and blocks (white belt stuff) then moves all the way through to weapons training and defence. There's a whole section devoted to the use of 'conventional weapons' like brooms, forks, books, etc. very useful in teaching our relatives the ""Basics"" on how to defend themselves without having to spend several years in martial arts training. I thoroughly recommend it to anyone."
3,Night Fever - running a temperature!,"I always try to suspend belief when I read these romances. That being said, I thought Pru was a little too prudish in the way of the world. Her being a virgin didnt bother me as much as she seemed a little too over protected from things especially living with 3 men: her grandfather and two brothers for heaven sake!!Roarke was great but I had to remember this was 1990 when every other sentence with him in it had him attached to this cigar! In the elevator, cafes, hospital whatever!! Have you ever kissed a man who has been smoking a cigar? Well, I have and it is NOT pleasant. Let's hope it was a cheroot!!! :D:D:D:D:D But the rest of him was written quite well.It was an amusing romance, sensuality a 6. Drugs and law are popular topics; never seeming to go out of style, unfortunately. Read the book quite quickly and it moved along nicely. Now on to more serious reading. These foo foo books are raising my blood sugar!"
2,Not Good...,"Rourke started out a great hero, but this author can never keep a hero 'cool' through an entire book. (Plus, nothing wrong with smoking cigars, but did she have to let Rourke smoke practically one right after the other? And even back then, he should have been considerate enough not to smoke in an elevator full of people.)Becky was a pretty good character but those brothers? There was a 10 year old and a 17 year old and the author had them talking like adults. I wish D.P. would learn how to give teens and pre-teens dialogue true to their ages. Even Rourke's lines were extremely formal, and not 'everyday' speech."
5,night fever,all of diana palmer books are good. i like the way she write her charitures and the good all way wins
2,New Editor Please...,"I understand that Diana wrote this in 1990, and I applaud her for not wanting to update the book, since she no longer has first hand knowledge of the topic (per the introduction). I just wish her editor was better, as I had several typos in my copy-one on the FIRST page! At least I think it was a typo, as I don't know of anyone who wears cutoffs and a tank top in supper.The story was ok, more like the Diana I grew to love in the 1980s and 1990s (since the book was originally published then)."
3,Good read,"I really enjoy this book, I could not put it down. The attraction between Mara and Zander kept me turning the pages. I wish it did not drag at the end, but it's a must read"
3,Not that good,"I am new to this romance genre, but this book was no good. I ended up skimming through it all and never once enjoying it. Rent it from the library like I did."
5,Good book,This book helped me during the hard parts of deployment. I enjoyed reading the happy and the sad story's. This book is good.
5,A-Mazing,i cried through most of these stories and had to set the book down for a lil while and walk away. it was a great book and i would recommend it for anyone looking for a good read.
4,Great,"Make sure you have some sort of tissue handy, you will laugh out loud and cry. A must share with any military spouse"
5,Perfect for any Military Wive,"This book is touching, compassionate and reinforces why our country is so great! Have a box of tissues near by this one is a tear jerker!"
4,Can't Wait for More.,Chicken Soup for the Soul books just get better and better. I'm waiting for my next Military Wife's edition and am hoping for a Military Children's edition as well. I gave this 4 stars only because I save 5 for those that excede my expectations.
5,Satisfied Army wife,"Well, I guess we're one of those typical young Army families. On May 15, me and my husband graduated college and he was commissioned. We were married the next day, and less than a week later drove cross-country to our first base. This book has provided encouragement for me so far. I enjoy the stories, especially the ones about missing the guys when they're in the field or deployed. Some of the stories are cute or funny, and others are really sad and touching. This kind of book lets you know you're not alone. I'll admit there are more Army, USAF, and Navy stories and not many USMC stories. Perhaps there will be a volume 2 that is more balanced?"
2,Wasn't all that heartwarming...,"Or am I just an emotionless rock? I have read Chicken Soup books in the past and they have always left me touched, inspired, and in tears. This one however did not and I found myself reading through the stories compiled rather quickly and in an almost skimming-through manner. The writing was lackluster and aside from a couple of stories, I felt dissatisfied throughout most of the book. There was no shortage of Christian-related mentionings and that left me rather uncomfortable as I do not share in the belief. Overall, this was a disappointment but not a total disaster. The large, faith-saturated portions may certainly satisfy most of the target audience but for a few mavericks, it drained whatever little emotional value each story had to begin with. I respect and salute those who can relate to this Chicken Soup series, I am just sorry it wasn't flexible enough for me to relate to as well."
1,Change The Title To Christian Military Wife,"I was looking for some inspiration and comfort as a new army wife and found only evangelical pander. Some are not as religious as others, and every story in this book sends a Christian message. No thank you."
1,"Good read, but not for Marine Corps Spouses","I've always been a fan of Chicken Soup books, and begged my husband to take me to the bookstore to get it. However, I was quite disappointed with it. Most of the stories are about the Navy, Army, or Air Force....and there weren't even a handful of Marines Corps wife stories. I guess that's why Marines are one of The Few, The Proud. Us Marine Corps Wives are the toughest and the bravest, like our husbands. We don't need a book to help us cope with deployments and such."
5,A must have,"As with all of the other Chicken Soup books, the stories are moving, inspirational and heartfelt. It is a must have for any military families library."
4,A Fast Read,"This book has a lot of white space. It took me an hour and a half to read it. It's a bit repetitive in the last third. It's true value lies in it being an original source. How many of us would take the time to pull the leg of the ubiquitous Nigerian scammer? It is clear that the author did not start by thinking that he would write a book. He scammed the scammers for his own entertainment, then shared the fun with us. One note of caution, the scammers are both more sophisticated than Mantu and they remain dangerous. You should not try to replicate the author's feats of foolishness."
2,A marginal read,"It's not as funny as many other successful scambaits I have read. He does keep them on the hook though, which is the whole point. This book is rated PG, and does not contain toilet humor. The scambaiting tactics used here are a bit easy on the scammer(s), in my opinion."
3,Pretty good but dated,"This used to be the best textbook and reference source around, but even with the new edition it is dated, with poor coverage of things like video, wavelets and compression, and a terrible treatment of morphology. There's better books out there now, such as Tekalp's book on Video Processing and the Handbook of Image and Video Processing by Bovik etc. Still, pretty good treatment of the basic stuff."
2,Not for Beginners,"The book contains so much math formulas in the beginning that you probably think that you have to go back to your math books. If you have to get this book for your class then basically you are in trouble like me unless you are an expert. The book is not also very interesting in reading. Authors do have technical knowledge but have no clue how to hold the readers. Unless you are wasting your life for Image Processing only then I recommend getting this book otherwise ""Big No-No"" for everyone else."
3,The Birth and Death of Dreams in Nigerian culture,"I was assigned this book in studying Nigeria, so although I had a negative attitude going into it, I was quite impressed and entertained by this quick read. By following the lives of three Nigerian women, this book shares the aspects of the culture and the effects that modernization had on the people. It is very light yet touches on emotional and thoughtful actions of the individual characters. I recommend this book as an easy, entertaining, and well-written story of females in a different society."
4,James Last,"Always enjoy listening to James Last's renditions of various pieces. This is a good recording, with a different take on some of the songs. Not always the best, but worth listening to."
1,Only thing missing were floor plans .....,"Well I guess if there were ever an erotic book that was written for real state agents, contractors and interior decorators this one would be it.Cheryll and Laura, two divorsees in the UK decide to buy St. Jude's, an old, with architectual history, abandoned boys school, and open a five star hotel/bordello. The book takes us through the paces as the girls buy the building, refurbish and re-decorate to such an extent that the reader almost gets the feeling of anxiety as the hotel is finished and staffed.Sure there is sex... but thats all I thought it was ... sex no eroticism, per se. The author treats the... trysts like must have body functions for these two women all parcticed in what I would consider trite and antiseptic..."
4,"Scripture Memory for Kids, 1st of 4 sets","A set of cards bolted together so that they fan out. Each set has 23+ scriptures for memory and includes 5 sections: Warm Up verse, Work Out review after each verse, Gold Medal and Victory verses highlighting the set's key message, Marathon Race Bible trivia game and The Xtra Mile. Great for parents to work with their children to learn more of God's Word. My son is young yet but I can see that now he will enjoy hiding God's word in his heart and these cards will help.The 4 sets are Basics of the Christian Life, How to Live, Getting along with Others, and Character, Choices & God's Provision."
5,Great Bible,"You can't beat the ESV version and this is a great thin line bible. Easy to travel with, or pack."
2,Durability may be an Issue,"Once I held this in my hands I wanted to read it. I love the cover and the bible itself is great! Solid translation, good features, etc. But after a week of reading the binding broke and the pages started to come apart. This is a bible I would want to pack with me for years and enjoy a journey with. I'd like to have this exact bible, but with the proper durability that will last for years~"
3,Bindery Problems,"I purchased this and loved it -- but when my husband looked at it he noticed something: the binding was printed wrong - it's about 1/2 inch off center. But then we realized that it wasn't printed off-center; in fact, the whole leather cover was stitched/glued wrong, off-center. In essence, when you put this Bible on the table, and then look straight down on it from above, you see the back cover hangs over about 1/4 - 1/2 inch. That part is not as noticeable as the words on the back of the binding.Needless to say, I am exchanging it -- after waiting to get this Bible and being so excited about this lifelong investment, it is too bad I'm going to have to wait even longer to get it right.Has anyone else had problems of binding like I did?I may change to 5 stars if I can get the Bible in correct condition."
1,False Claims,I read through it the first half was extremely dry and there are too many sections to even start mentioning which ones are obviously false. There are great stories which do demonstrate use of some good morals but one must simply read through Leviticus to see that this book is ridiculous and anyone who puts it on high praise is even more so ridiculous. It's also a bad translation from the original.
3,"Not bat, at this price.","The premium bonded leather is softer and feels nicer to the touch whn compared to other bonded leather bibles, I've handled. Like most of crossway's bibles the pages are glue bound. My only retraction is that the pages are thin and brittle, granted this is a thinline bible and designed to be compact. This particular bible hasn't the cross reference in the center(my next ESV will.) The translation seems to be solid and is easy to read and reread aloud. It has one thin black ribbon for marking pages, which can bend the top of pages if not careful. Over all this bible isn't bad for its price could be better, but not at this price. Also the ESV resource cd is not in the box and requires you to pay shipping, unless you download the resources."
5,Beautiful Bible and great translation,"The binding is beautiful, my husband loves it. ESV may take over the NIV. From what I have read, it is a more literal translation but still easy reading. It is different if you are use to the NIV."
5,beautiful & relatively compact,"I recieved this Bible as a gift recently, and I love it! It is beautifully bound in cloth & leather, the typeface is easy to read, and it is about 1"" thick which makes it pretty compact for a hardbound Bible. I grew up reading the NIV, but have had several friends recently recommend the ESV. I like it and plan to use it along with my NIV for study purposes. This is a simple straight forward Bible without any commentaries or devotional supplements. I highly recommend it."
4,not red letter,"I will not comment on the translation itself, but rather on this particular bible. It says Black and RED letter text but it is ONLY black. I am not particularly fond of black or red, but i just want to bring this to attention.other than that, good value. (not the best quality leather or bible, but you pay for what you get, i suppose)"
4,Good Bible,"Excellent translation, excellent cover, red letter edition. This bible has it all for those who don't want to feel like they're carrying it all."
3,"Excellent Bible, Poor CD","Some of the leather bound Bibles come with a Bible Reference Library CD. Beware of this product. It says it works fine with Windows 95 and 98. If you have XP proffessional or XP home, this CD WILL NOT WORK. You may have a great Bible, but you won't have a working CD. I've searched the Internet for Crossway's update page... nothing. Apparently they have stopped supporting this CD. So buy the ESV Bible for the printed version, and don't put your hopes on their CD."
5,Great Bible for Young Adult Male,"The cover of this Bible is luxurious to the touch. It makes one want to handle it. It is a great looking cover for a male. The ESV is an excellent translation, and it is in an easy to read format--user friendly. I have given several of this ESV Thinline Bible to my family and friends. I have one myself."
5,Very Awesome and Affordable Bible!!!!,"First off, let me say that I love the ESV translation!!! This Bible does not disappoint! The cover is great. Very durable and nice feel. The Bible almost has the ""Broken in"" feeling right out of the box. It lays open flat in your hand. Has a great concordance.Overall, I would recommend this Bible to anyone!"
4,ESV Bible,"Flex leather, written in modern Language, great for both travel and home. I like it more than my KJV :P"
2,Not much bang for the buck,"I adopted the ESV as my primary Bible for teaching, preaching, memorization and study soon after it was first released. I truly think it is an excellent translation. But I was and continue to be profoundly disappointed with the overall quality of this Bible. First, the leather, externally is nice, but the binding is poor with pages rippling in the spine. I keep thinking Crossway is going to finally publish a good-quality ESV. But thus far, all of them have disappointed me. I do like the ESV Study Bible. The only negative is the size and weight of the thing. It's a great ""keep at your desk"" study Bible, but not very practical for carrying on your person. If only Crossway would take some pride in the materials used and the construction of the ESV. This has been a complain every since the ESV came out. Is ANYONE at Crossway listening?"
5,Indexed!,"This translation is highly regarded for its accuracy. What I love most about this Kindle addition is you can look up a verse by book, chapter, and verse through the index. So I can type in mt 12 36 and go to Matthew 12:36 immediately."
5,Looks more expensive than it was.,"This thinline Bible's appearance is very high quality, especially for the price.I heard about the ESV Bible at a Beth Moore Bible Study. I like to have differenttranslations available when studying. This translation is very easy to understand.We are very fortunate to have so many well done translations in our modern English.I will be using this one as a gift, and plan to find a ESV study Bible for myself."
5,AWESOME!,It is a blessing to have an electronic version of the Holy Bible with you at all times! Thank you for making this possible.
3,Bigger not better,This Bible is just a lot bigger than what i thought that it would be. I mean it is practically my own fault for not reading the description right i guess but i thought it would be pocket sized when it is actually the same size as a regular Bible.
5,Product Clarification,"Purchasing this product I was a little unsure about the exact dimensions and type font of the text. Different websites had different dimensions and font size for this thinline Bible. Even Amazon contradicts itself in the Book Description and Product details sections. For anyone wondering, The ESV Trutone Black/Charcoal Crescent Design Thinline Bible is 5.375 x 8.375 and is less than 1"" thick. Also, the font is 8.2 (not 8.0 or 9.0, as I saw elsewhere). This Bible is beautiful design, perfect for preaching or personal study without the distraction of study notes."
3,The BIBLE is always great.,I rated this okay because I find it difficult to get to the pasages I want to read. I am not sure if it is my naievete with the Kindle or is it the item.
3,Holy Bible,This version is easy to read for those who have trouble with other versions as the KJV. It is exactly what i expected.
3,Not the best binding/cover,"The text of this Bible is neat and very legible. Overall I was a bit disappointed in the construction, though. The cover is a soft faux-leatherish that feels almost plasticy, and apparently the color on this edition varies, as some have said it's a darker red where mine is almost pink. The binding itself seems fair but overall it has not put up with wear and tear nearly as well as other Bibles I've used in the past (I'm a student, and often keep it in a backpack with other books, etc., and it just doesn't have the stamina for that.) Not a bad choice - if there even could be in Bibles - but I'm not as pleased with its durability, and the color wasn't what I was expecting. I think next time I will spend the extra for bonded leather cover."
3,Holy Bible: English version,"This is not the Bible I wanted, but could not find the Kings James version. I am continuing to read it until I can get the version I want."
4,This is a fine version,"I have been using the ESV for several years, after finding it pretty much by mistake, or was it? I like that it is both accurate and readable.I would recommend it for anyone looking for a bible just to read.I am disappointed in the user interface, but I guess considering the price (free) I can't really complain much. :)"
5,Gorgeous,I've had this Bible for years now and I really love it. The red is bright and beautiful and I love the design.
1,Not as shown,"I wanted a cross referance bible to journal the bible for a whole year so I came on Amazon.com to see waht they had. I instantly fell in love with this bible and its design, so of course i ordered it. When it arrived I looked inside and it looked totally different than it did than when I ""Looked inside"" online here. There was no cross referance part to it so I sent it back. I am very dissapointed all I really want is the correct bible ..."
4,The Bible that Jesus would read,"I have read through the entire ESV now, and really appreciate it as mix between a study bible and a reading bible. The word-for-word translation makes it very accurate, and yet it's translated in such beautiful language that it reads wonderfully. However, it is not a great Bible for memorization. And therefore, I plan on keeping my NIV version."
5,Awesome Read!!!,"Answers to all of life's questions! My rule book for life, my guide, and my salvation!!! Words of love from the creator!"
4,"Holy Bible, English Standard Version","works well for me, after I mastered the TOC process; this was my first attempt at using an eBook I had purchased for a Kindle"
5,A Must for Every Believer,"What an asset to have and carry on my person, no matter where I am. It's a convenient way to read my Bible wherever and whenever."
5,The perfect Bible!,I love this ESV Bible! The feel of it is great along with the cover design. It is the perfect size to bring anywhere and the font is a great size of well. The words of Christ are written in red which is awesome and the maps and guides in the Bible are great! This is well worth $20.00!!!!!
3,"fantastic cover, needs better paper","The TruTone cover (which is definetely not leather) is terrific. It's similar to the synthetic leathers that are used for shoes. In fact, I prefer the material to the expensive leather editions that I own. It is a pleasure to hold and the bible itself is very soft and pliable.On the downside, the paper exhibits a little more bleed-through than other bibles that I have purchased in this price range. Although Crossway has responded to the complaints about the paper quality with the release of the ESV Study Bible, the improvement hasn't worked its way down to its other products yet."
3,No Red Text,"First of all, Amazon's service was great as always.The Bible itself seems pretty good but it is not as advertised. I've received two of these Bibles and neither has Red Text for the words of Christ in spite of this feature being listed on this website and on the Bible packaging from Crossway. This appears to be a quality control problem at Crossway."
5,Beautiful bible,The ESV is my preferred translation. It presents the scripture in an accurate a beautiful language which I have not found in other bibles. This particular edition of the ESV is very nice. It is bound in calf skin leather which makes it very soft to touch and very beautiful. Some of my friends have even commented on how nice the bible is :)It's a bit pricey but in my opinion worth the money.
4,nice gift,"I went to a bible study and someone gave this one to me as a gift.I really like this one because its small, compact and I can carry it in my purse.I take this to church every sunday and I get alot of compliments on this bible."
3,Excellent Translation; Poor Quality Bible,"The English Standard Version is the RSV with about 7% changes in it, all in a conservative manner. It is an excellent Bible for reading and study. I find it ironic that the same folks who are clamouring for the ESV and how wonderful it is, would probably have set a torch to the RSV when it first appeared in 1952. The ESV is, of course, in the tradition of the Authorised Version, and one can still hear the echoes of the old KJB. It is my hope that the ESV---or the HCSB---will replace the NIV, and the horrendous TNIV, which has just now appeared as the completed Bible. Be aware that most Crossway leather Bibles, (excepting the Deluxe Reference Bible in Genuine Leather, which is smyth-sewn) are of extremely poor quality---glue bound, and the bindings will very easily split. The British Version(Harper Collins) appears to be of better quality."
5,Just the right size for what I need,"I'm a hospice chaplain and I needed a bible that wasn't too big that would be easy to take into homes, nursing homes, etc. along with all my paperwork. This one does the job perfectly! Also wonderful translation which translates a lot of difficult passages with correct renderings, Great buy!"
5,Eloquent accuracy meets style in the BIBLE!,"Not only is the ESV a precise wording of the original text with extensive research, but it is also ""packaged"" beautifully. I love how the ESV has revolutionized the way the Bible looks AND reads. A perfect combination of accuracy and beauty."
3,navgation,"To just sit and read this is an excellent app, however, to quickly navigate verse to verse it is useless"
5,Available editions,"It's a pity they don't make an slim-line version that has thumb indexes and/or centre column references. If you want slim-line you've got to give up these two features.They should make one like the NASB version ISBN 1581350260. That would be perfect - thin, cross-references, concordance, thumb-indexed, genuine leather. Will stick with my NASB for the moment. Might get an ESV as well when they come out with such an edition. They should dump the book intros of the Classic edition though. We don't need that nonsense in a regular bible. Save that for the study bible."
5,Awesome Sound!,"I bought their album today, and it was the best purchase ever! A lot of people say that UTIOG sounds a lot like the BeeGees, and I agree--their sound is smooth and easy to listen to. They also have a remix album (I found that out on iTunes, so I'd go there) and I recommend downloading ""Mama's Room (A Capella)""--it's really cool. If you love the BeeGees, you'll love Under The Influence of Giants!"
3,Fun,"Good cd. I saw them open for the Sounds; they put on an entertaining show. The record is good; not one that I could listen to over and over again, but it's catchy and fun."
5,And What an Entrance!!!,"I haven't been keeping up with a lot of the new music these days, mostly due to lack of time and partly due to the belief that music now isn't what it used to be at at least 10 years ago. There are solid bands - still going strong today - like the Wallflowers, Muse, Coldplay, Maroon 5 etc, so I tend to stick with the familiar.But I branched out.After someone introduced me to these guys, I was blown away by their hot fusion of soul, 70s disco-esque falsettos, and fantastic beats. Yes, if I could snog the music, I would. Better yet, every song is pretty different.Their kind of music hasn't appeared much on the market these days, I feel, which is what makes them so refreshing to listen to.So...that's basically why I decided to give these guys 5 stars - they bloody well deserve every one of them."
2,2 out of 11 isn't bad...,"""Mama's Room"" and ""In the Clouds"" are great songs and the kind of hit singles most bands dream of writing. Unfortunately, the rest of UTIOG's major label debut doesn't live up to the promise - or the fun - of these two songs. Lyrically and musically the other 9 songs feel unfocused and lack the marriage of retro and modern that makes ""Mama's Room"" and ""In the Clouds"" so easy to like - and so catchy. But the band has obvious potential to be explosive - it's just a little premature yet. It will be interesting to catch up with them on the next album and see where they're at."
2,Don't read this book,"This book is seriously depressing. It takes three or four themes and discusses each theme with regard to a particular patient, lasting way too long without learning anything new. It does not help you navigate the maze of chronic illness, as one book review claims."
1,uninspired at best,"Unoriginal, tedious prose that lacks insight or novelty. Better than his previous uninspired attempts at writing, but one has to wonder what motivates this author. This book may be of value for those in need of a good soporific."
5,Samsung All In One,"I use this for my small business and do alot of printing. I always purchased the Brother printers, but the last one I had was junk. So far, this Samsung printer is great. The quality print is excellent and there are plenty of speed dial slots. The only complaint would be is there is no easy way to use the speed dial. I actually printed out the list so I can enter by the number. Otherwise, the process is lengthy to use speed dial compared to other fax machines."
1,Don't buy this printer,"I got this printer a little over two years ago. It worked for 6 months then stopped with an LSU error. That was fixed under warranty. Six months later, same thing again. Estimated cost to fix - $150. The technician said it happens all the time to Samsung printers.I would give it zero stars but it is not an option.Fair warning."
1,Good When It worked,Worked fine at first. Used this printer as a backup primarily for copying/faxing. Probably haven't run 500 sheets through it before it went bad. Had problem with overheating. Gears made grinding sound and would not feed paper. Then it reported that it had a paper jam when it didn't. Basically I think it is a dead machine. I have e-mailed Samsung about the problem. Haven't heard back yet. I have had the machine for over a year so warranty is no good. Toner cartridges are expensive as they include a chip that tells you when your ink supply is low --- an unnecessary and expensive function. I can tell when ink is low by print quality. I have an HP LaserJet 1022 which is my workhorse. Have had it for several years without problems. Generic Toner cartridges are also much cheaper.
3,Windows Network goes off and on having to regboot to enable,"The Print Quality is great but Windows networking in VIsta is flawed, going from a Adtran Switch to the 2Wire wireless router, when trying to print states unable to print network down, on the printer LCD states printing and does not, you have to reboot system then it prints. I re-installed software and updated it and the same result. you cannot scan either it will not connect states unable to connect and gives error the software ""Scanner device not responding Please check if device is turned on""It is!! It copies well. Other printers work well on this setup."
2,Decent wirless printer... but only scans via USB,I am pretty happy with the networked printing... and even faxing (though I don't need that feature). But what really let me down is that this printer cannot scan via the network connection... only USB. I've confirmed this with Samsung's Tier 2 support. They claim they never marketed it as a networked scanner... but I have to say I feel misled.
3,nice if all you need is b/w,"This looked like a nice machine for the money, except that it only prints in monochrome. If you are only interested in black and white printing, this machine should fit the bill"
3,Picks up multiple pages,This printer after over a year started picking up multiple pages or not enough pages.
5,Test strips,"Price was fair, if you don't have a prescription and an insurance plan that includes prescriptions."
1,Not good for cats,"I actually got this for my cat. The brand before this (no longer made) worked for cats, and the strips were cheaper than the ones made for cats. My veterinarian was all for the prior one, and studies verified that it was as good as the veterinarian version. But I tested this against the veterinarian one, and the disparity in readings was 150 points. . . so it was no help to me."
4,Chemical People minus Pina,This album is good. It starts out strong and kinda falls off in the middle but worth checking out. This is the first album they did without Jamie Pina their killer guitarist. Dave Nazworthy plays guitar and does drums and vocals as usual. This album is a lot better than the one they released after this one. Probably their last good album
1,Recorded from the Audience,"I'm afraid this is another Opera d'oro where what SEEMS to be a superb performance by a stellar cast is absolutely sunk by the source of the recording, which in this case appears to be a tape recorder in the undulating lap of a zealous pirate, whose inappropriate cheers are only the worst of the distractions. You always take your chance with this label, which is the reason why I welcome the opportunity to spare others from my mistake. Under these circumstances, it's superfluous to try to comment on the quality of the performance except to say that it was probably memorable."
4,The best introduction to the subject,"Now that the University of Nebraska Press has undertaken to publish the complete James correspondence, these one-volume samplers can be relieved of the artificial responsibility to do the impossible - that is, tell the whole story in 600 pages or less.Horne's effort suffers in comparison to Edel's by its self-imposed mandate to favor previously unpublished letters. (Personally, I found these almost invariably of lesser interest. It looks like Edel skimmed the cream.) But his cannily selected interstitial material makes it a far more rewarding reading experience. I would say this now stands as the best introduction to the subject.And for what it's worth: the Penguin Classics paperback edition is a very nice piece of manufacture - comfortably sized in dimension and font."
3,Wayne 12-Volt 350GPH Portable Water Pump,"Use this pump and a 150 gallon water tank on the back of a John Deere Gator for watering trees on my property. I measured a psi of about 18-20, not a whole lot of pressure but still can use it with a sprayer nozzel wand. It works for what I need, hooks up with clips to a deepcycle 12v battery. Would be nice to have more pressure, oh and its noisy as all get out while running!"
1,Very weak pump,"I can't understand how this is advertised as 350 GPH. Hooked it up to a water bladder above the level of the pump and turned it on to find a weak flow out of a 6' hose laying below the pump on the other end. Laying the hose on the ground and allowing it to siphon produced nearly the same flow. Good luck pumping uphill with it unless you have a lot of time. Also very noisy.If you are trying to pump water into your RV from a bladder or tank it will work but will take a much longer time than the advertised 350 GPH would lead you to believe. My old water pump, rated at 150 GPH produces a stronger flow. Really sorry I bought this and will be buying a high volume RV pump to replace it."
4,Pain-Free Economic Education,"With so many states passing legislation requiring teachers to instruct students in economics, trade books on the subject are a serious help to parents as well as classroom teachers. This book introduces the concept of barter--the exchange or goods and services for goods and services--in the context of an engaging story. It's a good book for 2nd-4th grade students."
2,Not What I thought,This was not at all what I expected. I had hoped for more practical information and it was just about the author's experiences. More for home visits than for mass distributors.
5,Helped bridge two religions,"I follow a mostly Pagan Path. My husband follows a mostly Christian Path.My husband bought this book in hopes of understanding me and bridging our two faiths. He loved the book. I then read it. This book opened up a whole new world to both of us. We are now working hard at bridging our two religions.We celebrate Christmas together, and Yule. Easter and Ostara.Our religious life was greatly enriched by reading this book. It brought us to a better understanding of eachother."
4,Impressive,"I liked this book. It does a good job of explaining how Christianity and Goddess worship (both of which I believe are life-affirming) are not antithetical to one another. This is a friendly, humane look at the concepts and practices of both groups as well as the ideas that have caused division. The book's main flaw is a tendency to be repetitive."
4,multi faceted,"When we run out of play-doh, doh doh island becomes an exotic locale for several hot wheels dream cruises."
5,A Great Buy!,"This set is solid, the plastic is strong, and my almost 3-year old girl (I see a lot of reviews talking about this for boys) LOVES this playset, and so do I. The volcano slide for play-doh balls is fun, and there are 3 impressions on the volcano that can be used for additional play. I do agree that the play knife would be wonderful if it included an extension to get all of the holes unplugged, but overall, this is a good buy especially with the 4 small containers of play-doh."
5,Well Written. . . A Must-Read!,"Who me? I'll never be desperate enough to pay for a personal ad! If you've ever made that statement, you haven't read what these two professional copywriters have to say about it. This book is loaded with ideas that work. Even if you never place a personal ad, you'll find this book enlightening and entertaining. I especially liked the Foreword, he said, with his tongue in cheek!"
2,One good chapter.,"I read this book in an hour cover to cover because it was almost completely devoid of good content. The only enlightening chapter was ""How Search Engines Rank Your Website"". There was only one chapter dedicated to search engine optimization, and it was not that good. In fact, you would have found a lot more information on the internet. The book also has a chapter about Google AdWords. I am not sure what it's place is in an SEO book, perhaps to act as stuffing pushing the book to the 100+ page category. I would pay about $1 for this book-certainly not $20! Before you buy this book, please do your homework on the internet. You will likely find more information about SEO in a shorter amount of time than by reading this book."
2,A basic book for beginner,This is a very basic book for seo beginner. Not thing adanvaced in provided in the book.
3,this thin book could be even thinner,"Yes, I picked up a few tips in reading the book - mostly things that were ""reminders"" to check on my websites. There's a pretty good one-page checklist of things to do. But a lengthly discussion of network theory felt like padding, and the section of Pay Per Click through Google Adwords and Overture covers a lot of material that is available in the online help for people who use those services.I'd hoped for more detail on optimizing keyword strategies, and more on creating effective content.As a previous reviewer posted, this book is a good place to start, but it's really very basic."
3,Excellent Shipwreck Lore,"Spans 1821 to 1980, chronicling shipwrecks on the eastern shore of southern Lake Michigan. A well-researched narrative which contains numerous excerpts from the actual newspaper accounts of these maritime disasters. Some of these stories are harrowing! Also contains a few photos.However, the author's narrative was rather dry, uninspired, and was poorly proofread."
3,"Nice Concept, but when you concentrate on prices............","I like the concept of the book, organizing a guide on cheap eats in Vegas; but when a book like this is relying so heavily on specials and prices, it will date quickly - as ""777 Cheap Eats"" is already beginning to prove. The concept would work better as a website, where Miss Tucker could update the material in a timely manner."
1,"""Cheap Eats"" not very helpful","I've been to Las Vegas many times for business and pleasure. I did not find this book very helpful. While the concept for a 1 to 777 ranking of restaurant values is a good idea, this book has no information about the restaurants or their food. With ranking by price in various categories, you could use it as a cross-reference to the Unofficial Guide or Frommers. But who has the time? Just use one of those 2 books first -- both are good. This book would be useful to a Las Vegas resident, but is of limited value for a visitor. Prices have really gone up this year, so the information is out-of-date by as much as 50 percent."
1,Vegas cheap eats,"Very disappointed in this product. Nowhere did it say that the book was the 2003 edition. If it did, I missed it."
4,Informative and entertaining,I showed dogs for 35 years and subscribed to specific breed magazines. Dog World is an old magazine that I purchased as a child. The photographs of the beautiful show animals were partly responsible for my getting involved with show animals. When I purchased this magazine I was glad to find some of the format is still the same. I can enjoy the photos of the beautiful show dogs and still keep up-to-date on the latest veterinary findings and training methods.
5,Great book to engage young male readers,"I must wholeheartedly disagree with Gorilla800lbs. This book is great because of the pictures AND the poems. This book turned my 2nd grade son who hated to read, even though he is an above average reader, into a kid who begs to read ""just one more"". His favorite poem...""Booger Love"", followed closely by ""A Letter to the Tooth Fairy"". I strongly recommend this book to parents who are struggling to engage their young sons in reading!"
3,"ok, but too small","I wanted a pillow for my back like the one I got from the chiropractor, but couldn't find one anywhere that wasn't $35 or more. This one was a little on the small side, but it does provide support for lower back, I have a lot of disc problems, etc.. I did find another air pillow on amazon that was much bettr called medic-air back pillow. This one is just like the one I got from the doctor and I wouldn't be without them. I use it in the house and would be lost if I didn't have it in the car as well."
3,INTRO BOOK TO THE ROMAN MARTYRS,"This is a fine book if one wants a basic history of the early Christian martyrs. It's a quick read that will answer several questions about this period of early church history. Those with a more developed interest in the subject will naturally want to read other, more comprehensive works.It should be noted that this is a Catholic book, intended for Roman Catholic readers. The author sees the early Christians as early Catholics, something Protestants and others will take issue with."
1,Fade Master Clippers,"I received the andis master clippers and I was looking forward to receiving the clippers with excitement....but to my surprise when I received the clippers ...I was highly disappointed. The clippers did not work...and the cutting blade was not even working and the clippers were loud, and the blade was crooked. The excitement went out the door...I thought I was going to cut a really nice fade. I had to return this item back to get a refund."
4,Works great,Disregard the two star review if you know Anything about clippers then you know that you must adjust them when they are loud this goes with any clippers. I am a master barber and they work great if you use them correctly. They are mainly used for taking the line out of bald fades.
5,FADE 'MASTER?' YES INDEED!,"This is a SUPERB piece of equipment! My fade has NEVER been this amazing, and I've been cutting my own hair for about ten years! This is well worth the 90 bucks you'll spend!"
4,Awesome Clipper,Exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend this to anyone who are frustrated with the low end commercial clippers. This is a pro clipper that will get the job done.
4,OK for a year,This product is great but motor is too strong. It will churn through the guards and break them. Very hard to find the appropriate fitted guards.I think the appropriate guards have been discontinued.
1,Appalling,"This product comes with little bits of hair and small scratches. It also comes a little oiled up. I can only surmise that these are products that have come back and have been sent out ""as new"".This has happened three times. The first time I thought was just a once off, so I returned it and ordered it again. Same thing the second time. Why on earth did I order it a third time? I spoke to a friendly Amazon cust service rep and he suggested that this time I buy one not from a 3rd party vendor but from Amazon. This I did and guess what, number three came with little bits of black hair and small scratches. I'm keeping it though because I assume it will work, I need it, and I just can't go back to UPS once again. If I find that it doesn't actually work as well--I don't even want to go there.If I knew of ANY other recommended fade clipper, I would NOT BUY this product."
1,Clippers,"Horrible, I don't know why you allow this company to list items for sale through amazon. The clippers were defective. $100 of waste of money. Shame on you Amazon!"
3,Good starter set,I bought this set a year ago from Amazon. As another reviewer said they dull very easily and I got rust spots on them within 2 months. (I didn't dry them like I should have after each use) I got tired of sharpening them after every use. Since then I have purchase a more expensive knife and I use it exclusively. I may give away my Sabatiers or throw them away since they are just taking space.I like the Wood Block. Looks nice on the counter. The scissors I use all the time.IF you need a start set for cheap this is it but I suggest you spend a little money on 3 good knives. I learned the hard way even though I have heard this from so many people.
3,"Passable, but nothing special.","These were a good solution when I didn't have much money and needed new knives. They function, but they do dull easily and pick up rust spots pretty easily as well.If you need a set of really affordable knives, they aren't bad. Otherwise, I recommend saving your money for something better like Wusthof."
3,Rust Spots,"I've had this set for about 4 years now, and they are full of rust spots on the handles and blades. I have never even put them in the dishwasher (I don't have one) and I'm always careful not to leave them in the sink or anything either. The scissors broke after 3 years, the handle has a crack in it. This is a decent starter set if you don't have the money to invest in a good set right away, or for people who don't cook much. The more I cook, the less I like these knives."
2,Not the Real Deal,I registered for this set 3 years ago thinking that it would last me forever. Now I sit down to see about contacting the Sabatier company regarding my set because they have begun to rust. And what I realize is that this set is not a true Sabatier knife set at all. You may view [...] to see what the real set looks like. Now I have no clue who to contact to see about getting this set replaced with the said Limited Lifetime Warranty. Please research before buying.
1,Don't go cheap on knives...,"I also made the mistake of putting these knives on my bridal registry. I was grateful for the gift, but I wish I would have known more about purchasing a good set of knives that will last a lifetime. I've had the knives for two years and I am ready to throw the whole set away. Even after sharpening they are so dull it's no wonder we don't get cut more often (it has happened sometimes to me). They rusted very early on and the shears I threw away months ago because the broke apart. I agree with the other reviewer, buy/register for the more expensive knives (after reading the reviews of course), it will save you in cooking frustration down the road."
4,The Title says it all: Masters and Slaves in all their glory,"Terrific pictorial study of an event that is more than just a sporting spectacle. Some of the text hasn't translated to English so well, but that is only a minor grumble. Rare to find anything in English about the lives and traditions of yesteryears road heroes."
2,"Least favorite of the ""Hollywood"" series","I gave it two stars because I did at least finish it though I completely stopped following one of the characters and skimmed through the other two. It's about three distinct Hollywood women (a serious actor, a sexpot actor, and a very young writer/producer) and their men. It starts out really, really good (grabs your attention) but midway becomes a mindless read that eventually loses its ""umph."" The climaxes for each character are little more than a footnote on the pages. Too much emphases on the ho-hum stuff, not enough attention to the ""shockers"" which kind of brings it to an abrupt ending. If you haven't already, try ""Hollywood Wives"" and ""Hollywood Husbands"" - those books are 5-star!"
5,She's gone back to Hollywood,"Jackie Collin books are always a fun read but lately she had departed from the Hollywood, rock and roll and supermodel scene. She's back again and boy have we missed her. This time her book concentrates on 3 women who have made it big in Hollywood and their success has cost them their marriage and true love. It is fun figuring out who the main characters are based on.Of course Lola is JLo and Serena Lake is Meg Ryan but others I had trouble figuring out but anyways, it was a fun read. Welcome back Jackie, we missed you."
1,A major disappointment.,I'm a fan of Jackie Collins' books. Her books are a fun escape. I especially like the twists and turns. Hollywood Divorces has none. It's boring. It's dull. It will disappoint you. Jackie is capable of much more.
5,Jackie Collins Never Dissapoints. Give me more.,"As always, Jackie Collins has brought the world of the super sexy, super rich and super glamorous to us ordinary folks. I love how she gives us so many rich characters and so many inter acting plot lines. JUST TRY TO KEEP UP!! This book is yummy !!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not worth the time...,"I totally expected this book to be a gossipy, sex-filled trashy kinda of book when I started reading it...and that's exactly what I got. There was absolutley NO substance to this book what-so-ever. The three lead women are shallow, annoying, and whiney.First you have Miss 'Diva' Lola Sanchez who's all about extracting revenge on Linc Blackwood for a one-night stand that happened years ago and she can't seem to get over. Shelby, (who's wish-washyness got real old after a while) trying to deal with her husbands infidelities. And Cat, who once she started hanging around with Nick Logan REALLY got on my nerves...(You're so crazy!...No, you are...No, you're the craziest...aaaghh!)The only part in this book that was even mildly entertaining was wondering what would happen between Matt Seel (Lola's husband) and Tony Alveraz (Lola's lover and ex-boyfriend). Trust me, save your time and read something (anything) a little more stimulating, because this book just isn't it."
3,Same story told in a new manner,"Linc Blackwood learns what a scorn woman means when he teams up with Lola Sanchez. A night of lust years ago comes back to haunt him. From there it is just one continuous bed jumping tale until Lola's husband Matt suddenly sees the light of what is happening beneath his nose after walking around in a daze. The usual sex and drugs backdrop the story. Worth reading, but not really Jackie's best."
1,Vulgar!!!,"From some of Jackie Collins other books, I considered her one of my favorite authors. However, this book is awful because of the vulgarity in it. I don't know how well it went as far as the story went, because after reading a couple chapters, I had to close the book. I know the woman can write and write good content, so why she felt compelled to include such vulgarity escapes me! In writing this review, I have probably made the book even more popular for those of you who thrive on that kind of stuff. But, keep this in mind - Reading and eating are kind of the same, in that you are as healthy as what you put in your body, whether it be emotionally or physically."
5,Great Product!,"I am very happy with this wall mount. I was a little nervous to hang a 47"" tv on the wall (since the tv is so heavy and we have young kids) but the instructions were very easy to follow, and it works great with no worries. Installation took just a few minutes, and I love it- we were able to hang the tv at the perfect height to use our wii while standing, and it sits close enough to the wall that it looks great. I also like the tilt option."
1,Not Delivered Clown Suit - Where is IT?,"The item never came to me. Please credit my account. If cancelled or backordered, no notice to me. The parade was March 10th so need no longer & no delivery."
3,"PJ Brunson's ""Come Hell Or High Water""","When PJ Brunson and Cotton Brindle wrote ""Marvel Mystery Oil"" from PJ's ""Come Hell Or High Water"" CD, they wrote about my Paw Paw and his shade tree antics. The other songs are just as wonderful. I bought the CD at a PJ show, and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys good songs about just plain folks. Three Stars!Barb RogersSouth Carolina"
3,Watch out for old CD-ROM drivers!,"I purchased this as a textbook for a seminary class. I can't comment yet on the content, but I would like to provide a warning regarding the accompanying Libronix CD-ROM for those who have Vista and Windows 7. It may not run unless you download drivers. I couldn't get it to run and tried a number of solutions including downloading a program called ""DriverMender."" It still didn't work at first, but then I restarted my computer with the CD-ROM in, and it installed, although with errors. Not sure if it was DriverMender or something else. Good news is it seems to be working. I bought this product used-likenew from KZOO and they contacted me within 30 minutes of my complaint email and gave me a partial refund for all the trouble. Kudus to KZoo."
1,Clearly Anti-Catholic,"Don't waste your money. This book was clearly written for Protestants who wish to eat up what others say without doing the research for themselves. The contributing authors of this text are surely guilty of this in several places; there are quite a few instances where Protestant rhetoric is obviously being regurgitated in regards to early Church documents. I recommend The History of the Church, one of the texts in the Didache Series.Edit: Amusingly, at least a few of the contributing authors of this text have since become Catholic. Not surprising. :)"
1,Got Stolen,"When I bought the product the picture said X 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! they just gave me one, i paid for two items and just got one, if ""Good n Natural"" is the seller what can I expect? how is that possible?Anyway everybody knows the product is great, but I would not get stolen twice if the publication says it comes with two bottles"
1,very weak,This DVD only has 1 kata per weapon (4 kata total).I was really disappointed with this item. a big waste of $30.00 precious dollars.
3,Save your cash for Second Edition!,"All's I can say about this game is that it was fine in it's day but to buy it with Second Edition looming would be a waste of your cash(unless you are nostalgic). Personally, I don't have a problem with the game mechanics. Heck, I don't even have a problem with the fact that it takes HOURS to finish a single game. The short of it is, most people don't have 4hrs for a dungeon crawl, which is why other comparable games such as Castle Ravenloft are more promising in this fantasy genre. I almost never go over the 60min. mark with that or Ashardalon.Second Edition promises to be everything that was great about Descent 1st ed., with some streamlines gameplay. Can it deliver? I'll let you know, but for right now hold your horses, and your wallet."
4,This is a huge book,This is a very large book & not a light read. Sir Francis Burton is one of history's more interesting people but after reading this book I don't think he was someone that was easy to get along with. He was a brave & determined man & most people just wouldn't want to do the things he did. Also the things he did are incredible but the writing isn't as gripping as the things he did.
2,Interesting Person -- Not So Interesting Biography,"Richard Francis Burton is a giant figure in history, an amazing individual whose originality and bravery stood out in Victorian England. Although you'd think it would be tough to make the man who introduced the Kama Sutra to the West boring, that's exactly what Edward Rice succeeds in doing. The writing itself is not bad, but the narrative of Burton's life seems to wander aimlessly, as if the complexity of the man overwhelmed the biographer. I'm normally a fan of big, dense histories, but I almost couldn't get through this one, which is a rarity for me. Take a pass on this one."
5,First-class biography,What an excellent read! Price's narrative and research are wonderful. This book deserves a prominent place in the library of anyone interseted in African/Middle-eastern history.
3,Historical Romance with and erotic rush!,"The Price of Desire is about a young woman faced with the responsibility of providing for her siblings after the death/suicide of her father.Caroline Clemens has led a sheltered plush life with the love and affection from her father and siblings. She has been promised to a well-to-do man in the community whom she believes she cares for. It is not until her father bankrupts the family and commits suicide that she learns that fate of her new life. Her engagement is called off, her house is taken away and she and her siblings have no food or shelter.Penniless and desperate Caroline enters into a risky arrangement with attractive and wealthy businessman Dominic Savage- be his mistress and he will take care of her family.This was a story of an innocent yet curious young woman who makes the choice to not only share her body but open her heart."
2,Kind Of Creepy 2.5 stars,"2.5 stars. I lost all respect tor the heroine from the beginning of the book when she turned into a mass murderer and tried to kill her family and then herself so that they wouldn't have to end up in the workhouse ( not kidding). I kept on reading because the heroine mistress theme is my favorite theme and its pretty hard to come by, but yea this was kind of a crazy book. Too much sex that wasn't really sexy to me, and only made the hero come off as some kind of perv, and the characters weren't even really developed properly.The one good thing about this book was it started to get interesting towards the ending, but then the author had to ruin it by making the ending so abrupt that I dissolved into a fit of laughter at how stupid it was. I actually read the whole book though so that should count for something. Then again, I didn't have to pay for it because it was a library borrowed ebook, thank goodness! Read at your own risk."
4,"Loved it, only had one complaint","This book was very well written and I read it in one sitting, not wanting to put it down. I loved it right up until the ending, and I mean that literally. My only complaint was that the ending seemed rushed, like the author just wanted to finish it quickly. Even with the ending, though, it was well worth buying, and I'll probably read it a few more times."
2,Would be nice if it came with everything it says it does...,"I ordered this screen specifically because it says in the product description, ""Package Contents 1x LCD Screen with Backlight for PSP 1000 1x pry open tool 1x screwdriver 1x px"". Yet it only came with the screen and back light. Now I have to place another order with someone else to get the tools I need to be able to replace my screen. Way to go false advertisement."
3,recieved,I got the screen just fine. There were no cracks or any noticable issues. I like it and intend to install it one day.
5,replacement screen,"Really good product, worked just like it's supposed to and was carefully packaged. Installing was tricky for me because it was my first time doing that, but I got it done right."
3,LCD replacement screen for PSP,"I received this without the tools as in description, and returned and reordered the item. I changed the screen myself in about 10 minutes. thought I would need my fiance to help me, but I did it myself real fast with a tutorial I found online. Item was not shipped as described, but I bought the screwdriver(#00) separate and it's awesome! Now my son's psp is like New again!"
5,Bought this because ours cracked.,"This came in good condition and good protective packaging. It was easy t assemble if you knew where you took apart the last one from. There is a little bit of pushing involved to get it into the right circuits, but if your not sure what your doing youtube it."
5,PSP Replacement Screen,Once I had the right size screw driver replacing the screen was a breeze. I was so excited to have my PSP working again!
5,Just a replacement screen,"All I can say is, it is exactly what it says it is: the Sharp-manufactured LCD screen for the Sony PSP. The backlight comes included all as one piece, which is good (one less delicate thing to have to take apart). Replacement was a challenge, because you really need micro-sized electronics screwdrivers, and those are not common, you're not just going to have one in your drawer. Get the right screwdriver (size#00) and it will MUCH easier. Works perfectly now, no dead pixels, and I would not hesitate to buy it again if I happen to break a screen again."
3,PSP Screen review,"The company shipped the screen fast. When I received the screen it had a decent sized scratch on it. I contacted the company and they suggested a few things to check. But when they did not work, I took pictures of the scratch for their view and have not heard from them since. Overall, they were very responsive and quick on shipping but when I probed them some more for where to go further on the scratch issue they were all the sudden silent. They are a good company but if you have a big issue be leary."
4,PSP 2000/2001 LCD Screen Replacement,"I purchased the PSP 2000/2001 LCD Screen replacement for my cracked screen from Closeouts Master. I initially ordered the wrong part and wrote to the company upon receiving the wrong part requesting an exchange. I have to say that this company Closeouts Master was very understanding, customer oriented, and very friendly even though I incorrectly selected the wrong part. After explaing the situation via email to Closeouts Master, they promptly did an even exchange by sending the PSP 2000/2001 LCD Screen. I highly recommend this company for purchasing small electronic parts and I intend on using them as my first choice when in need of small electronic parts. They saved me $65 overall. Thanks Closeouts Master!!!"
3,False Advertising.,"The product description says ""comes with LCD screen with backlight, 1x pry tool, 1x screwdriver"" how am I even supposed to change the freakin screen without the tools that I purchased along with the screen that were NEVER INCLUDED. Terrible company."
4,Getting it Right,This item was the wrong size for the item I needed for my grandson. I returned this item and purchased the correct one with no problem.
2,NOT FOR PSP 2001,Disappointed that this claims to be for all models but it does not fit my PSP 2001. I guess I should've done some more research but this is false advertising.
3,PSP LCD,This PSP LCD screen was a perfect replacement for my PSP-1001 lcd replacement. The screen had no black dots and was easy to set up.
1,Worse then the one I had!,I was replacing a screen that had a stuck pix... Well this one is WORSE. it has more then one stuck and I am not happy at all. Junk. I want my money back.
3,this screen is compatible with PSP 2001,"I wonder if this screen is compatible with PSP 2001, because I live in Brazil and I have to be right, since it would be difficult to exchange, my psp is the slim model 2001 i bought it.thanks!"
1,This was not a GAME you idiot!!,Not a game. PSP replacement screen. Wasted purchase because the super small clip broke when replacing the screen. Now I have a screen and no PSP.
4,Replacement Screen for PSP,Bought a Sony PSP original LCD backlight screen. was treaky but worth it.The unit works great. Beat buying a new system.
5,"Well, it works.","My son broke his screen and we replaced it with one like this. It was great to get it working again. Follow the direction carefully, it was very hard to replace the screen."
3,Not the best...,"I give this Diva's DVD 3 stars this year. If your into the bikini's (most males are) then you will like this very much. Most of the Diva Search Girls clips are very short (Amy, Maria, Michelle, Candice, Joy, and Melina) while the other Diva clips are very long. This DVD also is missing one of the current roster Diva's Molly. If you're a very big Molly fan and only wanting to buy this for her you shouldn't cause she isn't on this. Also, they extras this year are mostly t&a wrestling, so most males should love that. Overall I give this a 3. I thought the main video was alright. I thought the extras were alright to. This DVD isn't better then last years though."
5,Best Diva DVD Ever!,"I'm writing this in 2012 and I say that the divas division in WWE is on a downward spiral, so I started watching these dvds again and I didn't think of them too much when I first got them but then I watch them back now I thought ""wow the divas division was so good back then! what happened???""This dvd has a great mix of the divas from the attitude era in Trish, Lita, Torrie, and a good mix of the later divas very early in their career that would become stars in Melina and Candice. Plus we get to see Lillian!!! Plus this dvd contains probably the greatest women's match ever and that is Trish vs. Lita at Raw 12.6.04. Great dvd!"
1,Where is our Kurt Angle DVD?,"I agree with an earlier poster, if I want to see hot women on DVD, I'd get some porn. Throw in the fact that the greatest Diva of all, Molly Holly, isn't on here (we'll miss you Molly), and you should save your money..............to spend on a Kurt Angle DVD. The public demands it, oh it's true, we want a DVD dedicated to the most celebrated real athlete in WWF history, our Olympic hero. It should be three disks:One of Angle with hair (with matches against Jericho, Austin, Benoit, Rock and the Armageddon 6 man Hell in a Cell and more)One of Angle bald (with matches against Benoit, Hogan, Guerrero, tag team matches with Benoit and more)One dedicated to great Angle promos - (the early years, with Stephanie McMahon, Team ECK- (Edge Christian and Kurt), the Invasion era with Austin, Team Angle and more)I bet a dollar and a donut it will far outsell this DVD. If I wanted to see talentless bimbos, I'd go down to the Crazy Horse. Otherwise, Anglemania must continue to run wild."
3,"The transfer holds this item back, along with some repetitive material.","First of all let me say I am in no way downplaying John Santerineross' work. 5 stars all the way. Pure beauty in its darkest and most intriguing form.I gave this presentation only 3 stars since the transfer is bad. His images are grainy, low res. Even though I enjoyed the dvd overall, 3 of the pieces on it seemed like rehashes of one another. Similar clips/stills/materials just rearranged w a different score. Different interpretations of the material, but nothing new overall. Needs more variety exploring his body of work more.Even the interview was grainy. Moreso, at the beginning of this interview, ""Play"" is visible in the upper right hand corner as if someone was transferring this clip from their vcr. Poor quality.His work is amazing on many levels and emotions. I am a bit disappointed in the overall technical execution of this title."
2,it was ok,"This multimedia presentation was nice. The images where amazing, I would give it a five but, I felt lost. I didn't know anything about the artist or what neo-symbolist photography was. I was hoping that there would was background history on the photographer and why he chose to do this. I also wanted maybe a little information of what neo-symbolist photography is. So if you know who Snterineross is and what neo-symbolist photography is i highly recommend it. but if you don't, stay away, until you do."
4,Moist Jihad,"Really solid DVD, band is on a big stage pumping out the classics with raw energy, if you know the Moistboyz this is probably them at their height as Dickie Moist has left the band for awhile. I personally would have liked to see some early 90s shows because this concert was arranged to look like a dvd shoot. Meaning its in a nice venue, big stage, good lighting, great sound, all the camera angles covered, it doesn't really fit the Moistboyz for some reason. No stage ground level basement shows, the band brings the power, look up the video of OG Simpson on youtube from 1994 and see what I mean."
4,Great bowls,"I already had one set of these bowls and ordered another to add to my collection. They arrived in perfect condition. Great little bowls for cereal or soup, like others have mentioned. I have never had any problems with quality in regard to the Sango Gold Dust dinnerware. My only regret is not ordering more and taking advantage of the 4 for 3 promo!"
4,Replacements,We bought these to replace bowls that we had broken. You can put them in the microwave or use in conventional oven
2,My experience getting bowls,I received the bowls in a timely manner but they were not packaged well enough and two of them were broken. They need to wrap them in bubble wrap and then put air pillows in to fill up the space.
4,"Good Originals, Terrible Remix","The originals are great and a real good way to whet one's appetite for the old 1930's Shanghai 78s recordings from Pathe. Luckily, the original recordings were compiled by EMI into a 5-disc box set sold only in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Luckily, that set is available here: [...]If you want more of this music, go dig around for a set of cd's called ""The Pathe 100"". There are collections of the pre-WWII female vocalists, old Chinese film scores and all kinds of audible oriental goodness."
2,Good Source Material / Cheesy Remix,"Ian Widgery is no Fatboy Slim. The original tracks by Bai Guang, Zhou Xuan, etc., are wonderful old discs. And in the right hands they could be sampled and scratched into something jaw-dropping.But the remix is like bad 'seventies disco, like ""Stars on 45"" or those dreadful ""Star Wars"" dance singles. Cheesy synthasizers & tedious beat tracks. Forget it."
4,"Good originals, bad remixes",This is a great compilation of songs by well known lounge singers of Shanghai during the 1930s period. This is a must buy for anyone who like the Chinese songs featured in the soundtrack of Wong Kai Wai's movie In the Mood for Love. One thing I dislike about it are the remixes on the first disc. It's like listening to hip/hop or techno pop versions of Moon River or Misty. Fortunately you also get the original versions on the second disc.
3,an okay prog release,"i read some reviews about this band and decided to check them out. sadly i found them pretty average prog music. are they good? yes. are they competent? sure. do they offer anything different, orginal or above average? no. sad to say, the music industry is flooded with prog bands and their sweeping symphonic sounds. but the industry is saturated with average artists. this is exactly what happened to the ""new age"" music category. nothing but copy cats of copy cats. don't get me wrong, they guys are alright. if you don't have a lot of prog music or are new to the scene, this would be as good as any place to start. but if you're familiar with the scene and have a lot of discs already, Pallas will have nothing new to offer. sorry."
3,over the hedge,I bought this for the grandkids and they love it. The two that play it the most are 5 and 7.
3,I'm not so sure...,"It is hard to decide who this game was made for. It has a lot of violence and cartoon humor, like the movie. This makes it not that good for most people under 9 including me. The game has a bad storyline, though, it's okay except the cage part. Try playing the demo before you decide. It is much, much better on PC than on GameCube."
1,depressing,I just did not like the songsI was hoping to find a fun unlifting songthat students and staff could join in tosing. Instead the CD was Bah!
5,The BEST fun and teaches thanks,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter's friend and also got one for her for Christmas. I couldn't wait to hear it, since I got it in November. I have ""Free To Be..."" and I was so delighted with this CD. The stories are on target, and the songs are also funny, cute, sweet, telling, etc. In one week, we've listened to the CD in the car and in the house at least 20 times. It's FABULOUS. My daughter loves the 2nd and third track. I love the cast of characters and all they offer to the kids. The proceeds go to Childrens Hospital, a worthwhile cause."
3,ok video,"this video's ok. i mean, i'v seen better but you may as well watch it. because if you dont, bad things might happen..."
2,Buy the cheap version FIRST!,"I couldn't agree more about the sound quality of imported pressings -- they ARE superior. I think Peggy Lee is the greatest, and I never thought I'd say this about ANY effort of hers, but this album is God awful. Her vocals (as always) are inspired, but the material is the pits, and her recordings of Asian ""poetry"" to harp accompanyment are toe-curlingly embarassing -- what was the lady THINKING? Try a cheap pressing first (if you must) and then ask yourself, ""Do I REALLY want to hear this material more clearly?"""
5,LOVE IT!,So convenient and so sturdy! I can load two tall laundry baskets! I would 100% recommend this product if you have to haul a bunch of stuff around on a regular basis.
3,Came in chipped and covered in grease,"Ended up returning this item, because when I opened the box, the metal parts were chipped in some areas, and it was covered in grease. I bought the same item a week later at a local warehouse store for half the price."
3,Difficult to roll in the sand,"Its a beach cart, so it should roll better in the sand. I think the wheels are just too small. I have used this several times this summer, it does hold ALOT of stuff, but its a killer dragging it through the sand. Overall, I'd take this over nothing, but I am in search of a real beach cart, with wheels made for the sand."
5,beach wonder wheeler,This was so nice to take on the beach and not have to carry everything. We did purchase the replacement bigger wheels to go through the sand better but they did not arrive until after we went to the beach. These wheels did fine. Cant wait to use it again next year.
4,Useful.,Useful. Worth the money. But the outside umbrella holder (which uses velcro) does not work. I'd still recommend it though.
3,Quality problems...,"Let me start by saying the WW Deluxe definately made our week at the beach much easier. But I have a few complaints about the overall quality of it. The second day at the beach, I noticed rust already forming on the metal. The big wheels make it easier to pull in deep loose sand, but definately not easy. By our last day at the beach (7 days), one of the front wheels broke, and I noticed a hole in the netting. So maybe they could improve on the quality, but the idea is good, and it definately made our trip much easier."
1,Deceptive advertisement on box,"Thought purchased last year July 2011 was my first use. The box proclaims ""4 inch wheels"" gives a large picture on the box of its product with 4"" WIDE wheels similar to the ones on my neighbors which was an easy task to pull and push on deep sand. Her wheels were 4 inches wide. This product wheels are 4 inches in diameter and only 1 inch WIDE - too narrow to push on the 40 foot path to reach a Hilton Head beach. I though the weakness of a mature adult was the fault until a college age student who stopped to help and he couldn't do it alone.It was the same as trying to ride a bike on soft sand - it is impossible.This purchase was my own fault for not checking it when it arrived. Amazon spoils you -99% of the retailers with whom the deal are reputable Its liberal return policy makes it manifest that it will hold retailers accountable regardless the reason a rarity today"
3,"Warning , No brakes, cart rolls away. Beach only use.","I bought the Wonder Wheeler to use at 6 flags/ Hurrican Harber my 4 kids and I have season passes to. The cart did hold every thing I had with me nicely however, it kept rolling away from were I put it because the wheels didn't have a lock. Thinking that some how the locks were a missing part to the cart, I called Cos. service to get the locks mailed to me. Come to find out it dosn't have locks. This cart would be great for the beach ONLY."
5,this thing rocks!!,"GREAT cart, for the beach, pool or picnic. love the removable bag & pouch/velcro on the the side. Fits 4 chairs with no problem. Only thing it's missing is a brake. This thing fits sooooo much stuff in it. We're a family of 4 it totally works for this family! no regrets."
5,Great help,This item is very helpful for lugging all the necessary equipment my family enjoys bringing to the beach . It will cart at least 4 chairs 10 towels games lunch bag etc. It came is two days and was mostly assembled. LOVE IT!!! Fast quick easy.
3,O.K. product,"Arrived on time, no problems with vendor or shipping and billing. The cart itself could have bigger wheels, they tend to bog down in dry sand, but it does manage to hold eveything that my family of six needs for a day at the beach. Also the umbrella holster tends to rub and bind up with the front wheel when used with a large beach umbrella."
3,Wonder Wheeler Cooler & beach chair cart.,"It's light weight and works great on flat surfaces but, unfortunately, doesn't move well on sand when it's loaded.The bar for your beach chairs(unless they're short ones) isn't high enough resulting in the chairs tangling with the front wheels.Disappointing!!"
1,The wheels are cheap and don't stay on the cart,"The idea is terrific but we made the mistake of not assembling the cart BEFORE we left for vacation. After reaching our destination, my husband took the cart out of its box, and attempted to attach the wheels. The first rear wheel went on fine, but the second was defective and would NOT snap in place no matter what we tried. Since we ordered it a month before leaving and were gone for 3 weeks, it can't be returned. I looked all over the web to see if you could order replacement wheels, and they are no where to be found. Don't buy this product. It's cheap junk!"
4,Not Your Granny's Wagon,"No grannys here. I call this the Young Hot Chick wagon. This Wonder Wheeler has definitely improved my life. It can easily handle 12 loads of laundry, plus detergent & bleach bottles. The large back wheels make traveling over an occasional step/bump much easier to handle. BUT I originally read it can handle up to 100lbs and I carried a couple (okay, maybe a few...) cases of water with my groceris. It definitely can handle the weight, once. After that the front wheels will come loose (I've had the wheel bolt repaired and then replaced as one of front wheels came off) I now believe it can handle 75 pounds easily and consistently. The makers of the Wonder Wheeler would do well to design a stronger frame."
1,Second Hand Cart Sold As New,I did not open the box when I received it. This weekend I took the box to my brother-in-law so he could haul it to Florida in his truck. He open the box on Sunday and called to say the Deluxe Wonder Wheeler cart looked used. The frame has rust on it and the wheels show wear. It is to late to return the item as we are going to the beach this weekend. We will see if we will be able to use it. Will add to review upon return from vacation.
4,must have,"i have one of these, got it at a thrift store in excellent condition. I only paid $7 for it! i didn't realize it cost this much brand new. I've seen simular item at Walmart for $30, and they only had two back wheels and front was wheel-less. So i knew it was a steal.So i have it second hand and i've used a few times at beach, works great for me!"
2,More trouble than its worth,"We bought the wonder wheeler last year and are just about to pack up for this years vacation. To let you know how helpful it was, we aren't even taking it to the beach with us this year. Yes, it does hold a lot of stuff including 4 beach chairs at a time. However, once you get onto the sand you have to drag it, and as loaded down as we had it this task took 2 people. If you are looking for a cart to get things to the edge of the beach it is a great product. If you want to roll on up to your lounge chair near the waters edge...forget it. May try another cart with the big wheels..."
4,Rio Brands Deluxe Wonder Wheeler,"Well, it's not that it's not well designed. I guess I didn't realize that it would be so, well....HUGE! Since I am single, I think this product is best for families. If you have 2 or 3 kids, I think you can fit everything you could possibly ever need in or on this thing."
2,Worked great for about 2 trips,"Then one of the front wheels broke off simply pushing the cart through the sand. The way the wheels pivot, there is no way to fix it and we had no choice but to return it. Too bad because when it worked, it really did the job."
4,Great for a couple of years,"So this is the third Wonder Wheeler I've purchased for my beach house since 2002. They really are great for hauling stuff to the beach, but they do rust and the small front wheels do break over time. I keep buying new ones because I think they are worth it even if they only last 3-4 summers."
2,Not so great,"This books are full of syntax errors and answer errors. Most of the syntax example does not include a diagram, a lot of guessing game here. You got to imagine the network yourself. Most of the explanations are also not very clear.I bought many book by Sybex, this is the only book that disappoint me.Not a good buy. I gave it two stars for thier effort."
4,Great book,"Of course, the plane has to crash. Other than that, great story, solid science. What flight of the Dragonfly was meant to be."
4,Good hard scifi book,"I've never read much science fiction in my day, much less books with more hard scifi than fantasy elements, but Forward does a really good job of keeping the novice scifi reader hooked in the book, even when describing the gravitational pulls of binary planets or Newtonian law and how it affects the propulsion of a ship powered by a lightsail. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to get into the more factual section of scifi and away from the fantasy worlds of Star Wars and Stargate."
3,An ok attempt had hard SF (minor spoilers),"The author was clearly someone who loved science. However, in his attempt to describe the science in way too much detail, he forgot things such as logic. There are too many plot holes in both science and characters' actions that just shouldn't have been made. Just one, mid-level, example is sending all your pilots down on a single expedition. There are others, such as his lack of understanding of Hodgkins and its cures (I was diagnosed with it while he was writing the novel, I know his stats are off). Then there's a big one that I won't mention because it's key to the story.What saves the book is the combination of two things. First, his love of science is very clear and enjoyable, and he only mildly overdoes is -- not to Melville standards. Second, while his humans often relate in very stereotypical manners, his aliens are fairly interesting.It's a nice, average, hard science-fiction read."
3,Reads more like a Quartermaster's diary!,"There's hardly any discussion or debates on strategy or operations in this book, every page is filled with details on the movements of troops, planes and panzers, down to the company level.If you are into that minuate, then it's a book for you. The book also highlights the singular lack of strategic competence or operative insights in the OKH, a sad reflection on Hitler's propensity to appoint unqualified, armchair fellow South Germans to the post of Chef of the OKH."
5,Brilliant words,An immensely useful book by a brilliant and independent writer. To understand Makdisi is to understand what is most importantly going on in today's cultural-political discourse.
1,Romantic imp-pearls,"When you actually penetrate the rosy jargon, you find no real meaning, just empty pearls. The chapters spin by based on Wordsworth's concept of ""spot of time"" but the concept itself fails to justify all the time spent on showing Byronic theatrics with simplistic, hedonistic, flippant care. Time is the central theme of the book but no effort is made to actually deal with the timing of the verses themselves in the terms that the poets themselves used them. The author just glosses over time in its specificity and rests his argument on superficial observations based on the political context of the time. No mention is made of the religious and spiritual pathways that time is given in these verses despite the cover's religious imagery."
3,Take this book with a grain of salt.,"The author writes very grandly about her opinions of the schools she reviews, but her perspective is extremely subjective and not particularly well-informed. I don't doubt this book is helpful in terms of quantifying available schools, but try to resist forming opinions about these schools based on Ms. Whitney's subjective reviews alone. This guide is also not a very realistic financial resource for parents who, for instance, can't spend $8000 per 9-month ""year"" on a 2.5 hour program (that's the cost of one of the schools she absolutely loved). She does not realistically break out the costs of the schools and does not help inform about the school cultures, both of which are very important considerations when you're looking at nursery schools. She's pretty transparent about her ""love"" of some of the more pricey, exclusive schools, even though as we all know, price and quality are not always linked."
1,Expensive disappointment,"I'm with ""Preschooler Mom"" on this one - an expensive and mostly useless compendium. The information is nothing that could not be gleaned from reading the schools' individual websites, is not objective as to the schools' weaknesses, and is in some places completely out of date. (We attend one of the schools included, and the information is over six years old (as well as incorrect)!). Not only is the text laden with typos but it is poorly written and rife with irrelevant information (such as the demeanor of the receptionist/secretary in one school's front office). I would rather have spent towards tuition the money wasted on this book."
2,needs improvement,"May hold fluids, but it does not stay in place. Buy some good velcro to go with it..."
2,Did not work for us...,"We are ""training"" and really were looking for a useful aid. It didn't work for us, allowing the entire car seat and straps to become saturated. We will continue to use it with our younger child, IN HOPES of avoiding a diaper ""leak through"" accident."
3,Pick another pad,"I have only had this item 2-3 weeks. My child has not 'put it to use' yet. But feel I need to review to let others know. I wished I had picked another. It is smaller then I expected and not very solid in shape. It moves and gets rolled up every time my child gets in the carseat. Which is annoying for in independent child that 'can do it themselves'. I will add to this review after it is truly tested, but if you are unsure I would choose another."
4,seat protector,We had a friend and her toddler visit recently. He fell a sleep in the car seat and had an accident. Since I couldn't take the seat cover off I had to wash the whole seat in my bath tub. I don't know how absorbent this product would be but like the idea of protecting the seat.
2,Does not work in an infant car seat.,"This product is a good idea but it does not in any way fit in an infant car seat. The back comes up way too high--it was above the shoulder straps. And look at the picture on the package-where ARE the shoulder straps?? Unless you have an older baby in a large car seat, this thing is just too big. With the 5-point harness, the sides of the pad get in the way and have to be folded over your baby's legs. I've had to wash my infant car seat carrier twice already so I would love seat liner that worked but this wasn't it. They should make it in different sizes."
3,Decent product,"The piddle pad seems to be the best on the market, however I wish that it had holes for the belts to go through on the sides. Velcro, or something to hold it in place would be good too, but it does protect the carseat cover from accidents and spills."
4,Encouraging and helpful for beginners from 8 to 80,"At 38, I was convinced that I could never learn to draw. However, I found this book on the shelf of the local bookstore and decided to give it a try. What was there to lose? Only my conviction that I could never learn to draw, as it turns out! While I still cannot claim real skill at drawing without following the steps, at least I can now produce a reasonable reproduction of what I see on the pages of an Ames book. It's great fun and I'd encourage anyone who was ever told that perhaps drawing wasn't for them to pick up this (or any other Ames drawing book) and prepare for a most pleasant surprise!"
1,Complete Disaster,"The sports world needs a definitive photo book about Mantle. This isn't it. The photos are very poor reproductions of familiar images found clearly reproduced in other books. Here, they look like 50th generation copies. I returned the book without reading it but noticed that a sequence of Mantle's great catch in Larson's perfect game is described as a catch against Boston! Schoor, a quality writer, should be ashamed of allowing his name to put on this disaster. Charging $36 for this work is a crime."
2,Very Short and Disappointing,"Only 2-1/2 stars on this one. This could have been a better game although somewhat challenging and enjoyable. Very short gameplay, and would rate this $5.00 max."
2,Why bother?,"Rather boring game play. After playing games like ""far cry"" why bother with this one. The graphics, while needing more than a 64mb videocard and run with my 256mb ATI card still suck. Boring and predictable. When firing the weapons its like shooting a popgun even through my Bose audio system. Speaking of weapons; whats up with the 3 round burst on the m16? Nothing to write home about with this one. I like TaskForce 121 much better."
2,so so fps from groove games,"Anything that is from GROOVE games is low budget and usually kind of cheesy, its playable but obviously is loaded with so much cheese you will be constipated for a week.Dont pay more than 4-5 bucks for this game groove games are very short, you can finish them in one night paying more than 5 bucks is just to much for this super budget shooter"
2,if i'd known better i wouldn't have bought this book,"I just wanted to say that this book is nothing like what it's advertised as. i bought this book a few months ago and i'm still confused. There are no helpful drawings of suggestions for curcuit boards. most of the ic chips in the parts list are outdated and almost impossible to find. to make it worse, there are only a few useful projects. this book should be regarded as a failure and avoided."
3,Needs an update,"If you are looking to build some audio projects, this is a decent book. The projects are pretty solid. My biggest problem is the book has not been updated since it's last publishing in 1995, rendering much of the book irrelevant. Like the chapter on how to find parts, which suggests what you needed to do in the early 90's, but doesn't every mention the internet, which is by far the easiest way to find parts.Still has some good projects, and great information, but needs to be updated to look less like a 1960's text."
4,"Handy, but could be more technical.","I found the book to be quite handy with some good projects. I would have liked more detail on how the tone controls worked on the more complicated op-amp circuits, but other than that, I liked it. I had no difficulty finding the ICs at any real electronics supply store, they are all standard parts. (Don't bother looking for them at Radio Shack or the like, they are out of their depth...)"
4,"Good for hands on experience, but offers few explanations","You're not going to read this book and go off and start designing your own effects. In fact, it doesn't really help you understand how the circuits many of the standard effects work. So, if you'd like to tweak the performance of a circuit by changing components, this is not so helpful."
4,This book made me homesick!,"I started crying when I read this book. It is so beautiful and true, from the free hounddogs to the shy contemplaters and those of us who left home and can't quite figure out why there is an invisible rope pulling us back."
5,Love Cynthia Rylant,I bought this partly because it is by one of my favorite authors but also because it is about the Appalachia people of whom you see very little written. I think Cynthia Rylant has such a wonderful way of describing people and capturing their true essence. Her descriptives touch my heart as well as my 8 year old daughter's. I am especially fond of the way Rylant describes the people in this book and moves the reader past the stereotypes to get to know the real people of Appalachia. SHe does it in an almost poetic way. We love this one.
2,Flamingly generic,"Imagine every Western you've ever seen or read composited into a generic plot, then spit out in some unique form involving a specific place called Randado and a guy named Kirby Frye who just happens to be babyfaced. Do you really care, still? This book isn't bad, it's mediocre. There is no reason to pick it up over another generic Western. The text is periodically amusing, usually easy to read, and sometimes expressive, but the story is devoid of meaning and not all that interesting except to someone who needs to read a generic Western right now or they'll die. I wouldn't recommend this book to a paper pulper."
4,Finding their feet,"This sounds like a first album. It's worth getting for the standout tracks, which remain some of the best the band's done over the course of three albums. ""No Ordinary People"" and ""Baby U Rescued Me"" are terrific (and are available free on dolour.com).There are some truly bad songs on ""World War"", like ""So So Sad"" and ""Sophie"", and one song rhymes ""place"" with ""place"". Ouch. Still, definately worth buying all three of their albums."
5,A Wonderful Read,"Marion is a gifted writer...providing esoteric information in an understandable fashion in her previous works, she branches out and takes us on a journey to the beginning of All THAT IS in a work that is both challenging and thought provoking.I felt like I was reading a family history...at once compelling and engrossing. I recommend it to anyone who likes a good story and seeks information on questions about the beginning of time and answers to what caused the Fall of Angels. Fact or fiction...you be the judge!Keep up the good work...I await the next two Chronicles with great anticipation!"

5,provocatively sensual,"This Darvish album evokes the spirit of the Orient; lush, rich, humid and provocatively sensual... What an excellent body of work! This is one CD that I must have in my personal collection - and I listen to a LOT of music in the course of my week! Thank you for a most enjoyable morning!"
4,Interesting read,"Though some of the reasoning behind the viewpoints seems weird the book is still good. It take an interesting look at the religious right and how they perceive sex, as well as homosexuality. A read for any uber religious fanatic who thinks that sex is good, as long as it's Christian sex."
5,"Touching on passive voice, abuse of the suffix -ing, run on sentences, and many other common accidents of writers","One can have the best grammar in the world, but if the writing is still horrible, it's going to be very technically sound horrible writing. ""The Curious Case of the Misplaced Modifier: How to Solve the Mysteries of Weak Writing"" looks at all the causes of bad writing and how to repair them and revise them. Touching on passive voice, abuse of the suffix -ing, run on sentences, and many other common accidents of writers, ""The Curious Case of the Misplaced Modifier: How to Solve the Mysteries of Weak Writing"" is an essential guide for novice writers with its unique and entertaining approach to improve themselves."
4,'Harmony' abounds here!,"Three Dog Night was the hottest thing going between 1969 and 1974, and this CD is in the midst of that hotstreak. This CD contains some wonerful ballads (An Old Fashioned Love Song, Never Dreamed You'd Leave Me In Summer) along with some nice rockers (The Family Of Man, Never Been To Spain, Jam, Murder In My Heart For The Judge) and good poetic vibes from Intro/Poem: Mistakes And Illusions:Peace Of Mind-proving the 'Dogs can be both sentimental and versatile here. A must have CD!"
4,Remastered?,"While this is an excellent album by Three Dog Night, I can't find any indication that it has been remastered. It is listed on this Amazon site as having come out in the mid-90's when the back is copyrighted 1988 - identical to the non-remastered disc I bought around that time (including the same generic back-cover that MCA put on all their cheap cds in the 80s)."
3,A GREAT START,"not great value when compared to other albums available, but a few gems not on greatest hits or live at the Forum doninaustralia@yahoo.com"
2,disappointing,"although lear is an intelligent woman and so a clever lyricist, this album suffers from a lack of good melodies; the only memorable is the eurodisco classic 'follow me', the rest is not really very good; the opening side-long suite is in truth unimaginative and rather monotonous; lear did a much much better job on the very good 'incognito' from 1981"
5,Works as it should,"Nothing much to say works good, as for the price now that is incredible I saved anywhere from 80 to 100 dollars love it. When I need one for the otherside it,s a no brainer Amazon is the place I,ll go too."
3,A waste of money,"If you are really looking for a book on programming, this is not it. If there were more books on FoxPro 7, I could probably enjoy this book however I do not want to waste time on humor when I am trying to complete a major project.Microsoft is only supporting FoxPro 7 with their mouth, not with their actions. I would have expected a core reference set by Now."
5,Always pleased with service from Amazon.com,"The book was a present so I haven't read it, but in arrived in a timely fashion and in exellent condition. I appreciate that the packaging was small enough to fit in my mailbox. Many times when I place and order, something very small will be in a large box, which makes me have to pick it up at the post office to get it. Thanks"
1,A serious disappointment,"As a long-term employee of the Keiko Project, I looked forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, it is an example of shoddy journalism at its worst. The author spoke to very few people who had worked on the project; the book is full of factual errors or omissions; and the presentation of the story is very one-sided. In addition, it is poorly organized and contains no index. Photo credits are not given (even though the author did not take the vast majority of the photos). In short, the book is not worth the purchase price."
4,Very illustrative and good examples!!,"I would highly recommend this book for any students (Business or non businss)majors interested in learning more about Marketing. The text starts off with the four essentials functions of marketing which are product,place,price,and promotion. This builds a solid fountain for all higher level business classes! Also this text provides highly organized graphics and examples."
2,"Purchased 4, 3 working after 1 year","The fourth started chirping and wouldn't stop despite vacuuming and other efforts to find a solution so I was forced to deactivate the alarm (which drains the battery).Haven't yet sent it back to Kidde yet, so I don't know how their customer service will react. Will update review when I know!The other three are working fine 18 months out, which is why I am giving the product 2 stars not one."
1,The battery lasted one year,"I read the reviews on the Kidde 0910 and should have taken advice. I bought it anyway . The ten year battery last one year ..buy something ,anything else"
3,Very poor battery life,"Two stars because it does work fine as a smoke detector. But less than one star for advertised battery life - it lasted less than four years before it started to chirp ""I'm dying"". Warranty is to return to manufacturer with receipt, at your expense.** revision ** when I took it back to Home Depot, they told me I had to ship it back to the manufacturer for warranty replacement. This was wrong - the reviews online indicate I could have just phoned their customer number and they are aware of the early failures and will ship replacements."
1,Battery lasted less than two years,I purchased this smoke alarm with the optimism that I wouldn't have to replace it for ten years. The low battery alarm indicated it needed to be replaced after less than two. I would not purchase this smoke alarm again.
4,"handy, saves on batteries.Good amazon price.",Have a small motel. Need alarms people can't steal the batteries.They more then pay for themselves in not having to replace the batteries. I know I sound stuck on batteries but the reason I didn't give a five rating is because a few alarms do not last ten years. However they do give a warning beep to alert you.Good amazon price.
1,Died After Two Years,I bought this because I hate taking batteries to the hazardous waste disposal. Save your receipt and packaging.
3,Complaint,"The ad and the packing slip that came with the items says ""Smart Hush"". According to the comapny's ad, ""smart hush"" indicates that the detector is able to distinguish between simple household smoke coming from cooking, and smoke coming from a real fire. The item received however comes with a ""manual"" button to ""hush"" unwanted/unwarrented alms!"
2,Don't expect this to last 5 years,These are easy to install (So are the rest though) and promise a battery free lifetime. I have 10 of these in my house and have had to replace all but 1 - and they were just installed < 4years ago.
4,Installs Easy & Low Maintenance,Worth the premium price - installs easily and low maintenance.An easy installation and setup. 10 year battery is a great plus for this one if you have high ceilings. The lesser expensive ones are a pain to get to on high ceilings just to simply change out batteries. I've also had AC wired alarms that can be problematic going off/on in power outages even with the battery backups.
1,Had to replace two of these,Purchased 2 of these 10 year detectors in 2010. The first one stopped a year later without the end of life chirping detector activating. Only caught this on a manual test. KIDDE replaced it without question.May 3 2012 noticed the same thing about the second one. Called Kidde again and they are replacing this one too.There must have been a bad batch in 2010 because Kidde was great about replacing both.Hopefully I'll get the full 10 years out of the replacements.
2,Does not last 10Years,"When I bought a house, I installed 6 of these throughout the house since there were none present when I moved in. This was August of 2009. As of today, February 2012 I have just had a third one of the original six start chirping that the battery is low. This is well short of their 10 year rated life. I am pretty sure that some of them have never been set off. I test them about 3-4 times a year (they state you should test them weekly).\Other than the battery going out WAY too soon, I have really liked these. They have not had issues with false alarms, even in my kitchen. They are easy to instal and remove.The battery life just sucks. If they were 9V batteries, I could just replace them, but now I have to go buy all new detectors. Maybe this time I can find some of the old style with replaceable batteries."
3,Doesn't last 10 years,"I was really looking forward to not having to worry about changing the battery in this smoke detector, but mine died after three and a half years. I plan to replace it with a detector that has a 9 volt replaceable battery. On the plus side, it was reasonably priced and easy to install, but changing a battery is easier and cheaper than replacing the detector."
1,"Way, way too sensitive: constant false alarms","I HATE this unit. The one in my bedroom goes off whenever I use my stove in the kitchen. EVERY night. I'm through with it - it's useless.Anyone can make an alarm that will never miss a fire: just create a unit that goes off every five minutes, regardless of whether smoke is present or not. It seems like that's what this unit does. If it constantly goes off when there is no fire, can I trust it to go off when there is? Having to silence it every day erodes my faith in it, and means I don't take the alarms seriously.I do not recommend anyone buy this unit."
2,The 10 Year Battery Lasted 3 Years [and 2 months],"I bought this smoke alarm in April of 2008 [thanks, Amazon, for the record] because I wanted to put it in a place that's hard to reach. A 10 year battery seemed like a good solution. However, it only lasted 6 months longer than the battery in a regular smoke detector I bought at the same time. So, I got a total of 3 years and 2 months before I had to replace it. Not a good deal."
4,reliable,We got it as a replacement smoke detector for our wired system. These work great. I tested it with a match and we've also had a cooking incedent that confirmed that the smoke detector works. It is certainly reliable.
1,18 month lifespan,"unit lasted less than 18 months. did not give low battery warning before it died. since you can't replace the batteries in this battery operated unit, i am assuming this product is made by apple."
5,Peace of mind,"Think of not having to change the battery all of the time. Plus, The hush button is great when you are baking"
2,NOT 10-year Battery,"I live in a state that REQUIRES a 10-year battery powered smoke alarm in rentals (unless they are hardwired). Unfortunately. I would much prefer to just replace the battery when needed, since these seem to only last 1-2 years. I put one in the rental that started the 'end-of-life' chirp within 1.5 years. I figured it was a fluke and put in another one. My tenant just came knocking, handing it to me because it is 'chirping'. It has been in less than 2 years and has a manufacture date listed as July 24, 2009. Checking my math, but that is only 3 years since it was manufactured. I have sent a note to Kidde... we will see if they do the right thing.On the positive side, it is easy to install and the 'test' and 'hush' buttons work well. Additionally, the 'deactivate' instructions are clear and easy, which is great, since they have to be deactivated when they chirp after only 2 years."

WWE is bad, and if you buy WWE's DVD to collect you are so stupid you wre tricked by WWE, WWE is a pretend. I wanted to buy it only one more time I was angried and also my parents said who bought it will become like to hit friends to school. That's very dangerous, why do you spent your parent's money to collect every WWE Pay Per View, Ultimate Fighting Championship is still better.Maybe you have spent 20 million to collect these all, OH REALLY STUPID!!!!!!!!!!!!.

3,Much Better!! But Smackdown needs help!!!,"I liked this PPv, better than all the others. Smackdown needs to bring more big superstars to its shows, like Batista.Smackdown tries to revolve around the same guys: Angle, Guerrero, Cena, Bradshaw, Taker and the Show.Of Course their matches are good, but the rest of the show its just a once to watch, then just look at the match you like. (usually the main event)Im sick of seeing the same old matches, I think Angle has fought the Big Show like 150 times!! And has had 200 title shots, failing to be WWE Champion!!Anyway, if you are a Smackdown fan, the show is enterteining, getting better than last year, but still way far from RAW's PPV's."

It's a good professional chef's knife for Japanese style food preparation. Though it keeps its edge pretty well, you're going to need to learn how to sharpen a single-bevel knife to keep that super-crazy-sharp edge that's the reason to spend the money on a Shun in the first place."
4,Wife's Happy!!,"I usually purchase sports games but I was looking for a game to get my wife involved, she loved ""Over The Hedge"" so I thought we'd get the game.

4,Brad Stine is right on!,Not for the faint of heart....this book is in your face and your brain. If you don't like it...you didn't read it. There are some things that I disagree with but the way it is discussed makes me think about and that is what good writing is about. A must read.
5,"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!!!","This is definitely a GREAT cd! I was counting down the days until it was released for more than a month and I was not disappointed! I love every song on this new album, which is now my favorite. It has a bit of a new style, but it sounds really good. Nic(lead singer) sounds so good on this cd! I have been to 2 of their awesome concerts and they are all just amazing guys!SALVADOR ROCKS!"
3,Heaven,"'Kid' the reason they thought it was a great song is because it is. The song was written at least 5 years ago(it's on the Live at Blue Cat Blues album recorded in 2000). You weep for the future of music? So do I, but not because of bands like LLB. Los Lonely Boys are one of the few great newer bands out there. They actually have great musical talent, each is great technically, they are great singers, and they put together good, creative music."
3,...,"About half of ""So Natural"" is really really strong. And even with the weaker tracks this could have been close to a four star release. Unfortunately, Salvador made one huge error with this album.They cover Los Lonely Boy's ""Heaven."" That in and of itself isn't horrible... I'm not anti-covers or anything. However, they (or, more likely their label) decided that Salvador's cover of ""Heaven"" would be the first radio single from ""So Natural."" That takes my breath away. If I was the Los Lonely Boys I'd sue Salvador for that. Its blatantly promoting ""So Natural"" with someone else's work. As a result they should be entitled to a portion of the profits made from the album sales.Other than that, my only complaint with the album is the slower, ballad songs. If they kept the pace up and left off the CCMy stuff this could be a four star album, even with the ""Heaven"" scandal."
5,Awesome Christian Rock,"In the search for some quality Christian modern music, I came across Salvador when I heard their cover of ""Heaven."" These guys are fantastic! I thought I'd never find a band that was able to combine Christian themes with great, original music, but I finally found one. This is one of my favorite CD's in the past year. Not only do they have awesome musical chops, they also express their spirituality without sounding preachy -- their beliefs are very genuine and heartfelt. I love the Latin-tinged flavor of the songs. In short, if you're searching for good Christian music that rocks, you have found your salvation in Salvador."
5,Web Mining for serious professionals,"I found this book to be an extremely helpful guide to people interested in web mining. The only major critique is that it could be longer (only 115 pages or so) but it was extremely well written, and with numerous diagrams and examples. Since it is probably the only book of its kind right now, it is definitely worth it."
5,GREAT BUY,I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT ABOUT A MONTH AGO FOR THE PRICE AND I INSTALLED IT ON MY 02 PATHFINDER TRUCK AND NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT SINCE.
5,what?,"what in the world is wrong with you?""hbk tapped out,real wrestling wins"".youre an idiot.wrestling is planned out.it was planned that hbk would tap out.and just shut up already.you have no good points and make no sense!"
3,What Happened ?,"I remember a time when there was great action on the mat from charasmatic superstars that took your breath away. Nowadays the biggest guys in terms of popularity are a rapping new-england native ""Marky Mark"" impersonator and a monster of a man so hopped up on steroids enough to make Barry Bonds shake his head. With the exception of HBK vs. Angle, none of the matches we all that exciting and I ultimately felt cheated out of an event that was so hyped up for months before hand. There was some real potential here, but they just pulled what I like to call a ""Chicago Cub"" and took all that hype and attention and flushed it down the toilet. Too bad. But it wasn't exactly horrible either, its at least worth watching just to see the HBK vs. Angle match and some of the gags thrown in as well. (I loved the mock-movie trailers!)."

3,wrestlemania 21,John cena and triple H match are the best matches in the IN set it would be ok for $5
5,Wrestlemania 22......,"These are the predictions for Wrestlemania 22....WWE ChampionshipNo DisqualificationsEdge vs. John CenaWorld Heavyweight ChampionshipThe Undertaker vs. Chris BenoitStreet FightShawn Michales vs. Mr. McMahonInterpromotional Triple Threat Match for #1 Contendership of their brandKurt Angle vs. RVD vs. Rey MysterioTLC Match for the WWE Tag Team ChampionshipsMNM vs. The Mexicools vs. The Shane Twins vs. Paul London and SpankyHardcore Match[For the returning Hardcore Belt]Winner brings the Hardcore Belt to their respective brandKane vs. Viscera vs. Bobby Lashley vs. Big Show vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. The Dicks vs. Matt Hardy vs. JBL vs. The Boogeyman.Women's Champinship2 out of 3 fallsTrish Stratus vs. VictoriaThis doesn't have a chance in hell of happening, but I would be forever loyal to the WWE if it did WM exactly like that."
3,Wrestlemania 21,"This was an o.k. wrestlemania, but it could of been a lot better. The down sides of this wrestlemania are there were only 3 title matches? wats up with that? There were no tag team matches. The wwe championship match sucked. But, if you are going to get this dvd, get it for the shawn michaels and kurt angle fight. That was one of the greatest matches. Also shelton benjamin had some extrordinary moves in the money in the bank match."
4,Mania 21is still a solid ppv despite some stinkers,"Rey Mysterio v. Eddie Guerrero 8/10Edge v. Kane v. Chris Benoit v. Christian v. Shelton Benjamin v. Chris Jericho, Ladder Match 10/10Randy Orton v. Undertaker 8/10Trish Stratus (C) v. Christy Hemme 3/10Kurt Angle v. Shawn Michaels 10/10Akebono v. Big Show 3/10John Bradshaw Layfield (C) v. John Cena 6/10Triple H (C) v. Batista 8/10"
5,The best Wrestlemania,I watched the whole event and boy it was great. I enjoyed The Triple H vs Batista match and other matches. This dvd is a must watch!
3,Average At Best,"Calling this WrestleMania ""the greatest of all time"" like they do every single PPV it seems is a major stretch. While not bad, there is nothing incredible about this PPV. All in all a solid effort by WWE but nothing that stands out to make you say ""wow""*** MILDLY RECOMMENDED"
5,UM? Hello?,"Who in their right mind would give the sumo match 7 out of 10? I mean COME ON! This WM was so good for 4 great matches: Kurt Angle/Shawn Michales,Randy Orton/Undertaker, 6 way ladder match, and HHH/Batista. The matches that were good to see everyonce in a while were, Eddie/Rey Mysterio, Women's Championship, and the Piper's Pit segment.The WWE Championship is only good for Cena's win [The second time Cena has won a title at a WM!] The Sumo match comes last because it was a bad idea and one if not both of the tag team championships should have been defended.Extras include: Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony [But the Ric Flair introducing Roddy Piper takes forever, funny story though WOOOOOOOO!] Plus WWE takes over Hollywood bulevard with their shows and Cena even holds up traffic [Come on, you can't see him 5-0!]Buy the DVD, you will regret it the minute it's out of stock if you don't.P.S. Where is the Judgment Day 2005 site on Amazon? I want to see reviews for the I-Quit match."
5,this is an awesome show,"this show is awesome but the only thing i dont like is the wwe championship match that john cena won it too easy, 15 min?jbl would beat the crap out of him"
5,Fantastic,This is the best!! It will be hard to top. You have the Hall of Fame Induction. What's not to like!!
5,Stop writing TNA (...),"TNA is not in the same league as WWE. You're just upset that TNA lost their TV deal, and you can't stop whining and crying about it.The Hardy Boyz reuniting is just another attempt of TNA trying to attract an audience because the sad truth is that they are going out of business in a horrible, slow death.So try to start being mature and quit your b*tchin so that people, like me, can see if whether or not WM 21 is worth the money or not, thank you."
3,undertaker can b god when he wants 2 b and that sucks,undertaker vs randy ortonvery good match undertaker worked and took young lil randy 2 da wrestling store 2 by him so wrestling tapes on how 2 put on a good match as much as i like or dislike da undertaker i have 2 admit he can b a pretty good wrestler at time whenever he feels like it if he works this hard all da time da wwe will be dangerous because da undertaker has all da tools 2 make it happen and randy is still improving little by little he is da one of da future stars of da wwe if he keep on improving he could be as big as rock austin mick hhh angle hbk was in their day and still wrestling icons
3,My Predictions:,"Batista def. Triple H: I see Batista becoming the new World Heavyweight Champion.JBL def. John Cena: I think JBL will retain the title, but I think he'll take a major beating in the process.Randy Orton def. Undertaker: I think Randy will follow up his stunning win at last year's WrestleMania (Orton pinned Foley in a tag team match) with another stunning victory over Undertaker.Angle vs. HBK (No-Contest): I don't see a conclusive ending in this one."

4,Wrestlemania 21 - Goes Hollywood,"Well... the matchcard looks inviting, but after having seen the PPV I only rate 3 stars for it, BUT, the third disc on this release is the 2005 Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony, which makes the release worth 4 stars in my view."
4,Wrestlemania a very good dvd,Wrestlemania was really good and the matches were good.First lillian garcia sings then begins wrestlemania.Eddie guerrero vs rey misterio is a great match with good moves.The ladder match is one of the best matches of the dvdThe kurt angle and hbk match is very very goodthe womens match is very poor and the sumo match sucksthe undertaker vs randy orton match was my favorite with very reversals and a lot of finishers.the pipers pit was very funny.the wwe championship match was poor because jonh cena don't do anything and in the end he does a F-U and it ends.The main event is pretty cool with a great entrance by triple h and a excellent match.In the bonus of the dvd the bloopers and outtakes are so much funny and the battle royal is a great match with the superstars that doesn't appear in the show.
3,Didnt Buy it but I was there,Well I myself was kinda dissapointed in some of the matches at wrestlemania.The most wast of time was Akebono vs The Big Show.The Pay per view wasnt bad but the atmosphere was awesome.
4,A great PPV,"Rey Mysterio vs. EddieA great high-flying match, the corkscrew body press from Rey was great. Ended in 619 and a Victory Roll. 86/100Money in the bank match (Christian vs. Edge vs. Benoit vs. Shelton vs. Y2J vs. Kane)One of the best matches i've ever seen. Shelton's clothesline on top of the ladder, the concherto with the ladder, Kane taking everyone out with his flying clothesline, flapjack to the ladder... man it was a good match. 93/100Taker vs. OrtonA good match ending in Taker's Tombstone. 79/100Trish vs. Hemme (with Lita)Not a great match, ending up in a Chick Kick from nowhere 61/100HBK vs. AngleGreatest match I've ever seen! Some great technical wrestling and high-flying moves. The reason it's not 100/100 was the beginning 96/100Big Show vs. AkebonoAkebono throwing Show out of the ring in the end. 70/100Cena vs. JBLIt was a dissapointment. A f*cking sucking match. 48/100Batista vs. HHHA great match, The Game is all bloody in the end. 90/100"
5,wwe wrestlemania XXI,"Eddie Guerrero VS Rey Mysterio-pretty good opening match, eddie didnt seem to pleased with it after the match. But still a good match 4/5Money In The Bank Ladder Match-Great Ladder match, every man did great in this. Shelton really shines in this as well 5/5Randy Orton VS undertaker-WOW. amazing match. Even with the couple of botched spots, it still was great. Randy even turned a chokeslam into a RKO! AMAZING!!! tied for Match Of the night!5/5Christy Hemme VS Trish Stratus womans title-just a plain bad match, skip it. 1/5Kurt Angle VS Shawn Micheals-another great match. a little slow but still great. this is the other match of the night! 5/5Akebono VS Big Show-sumo match-dud 0/5John Cena VS JBL wwe championship - not that bad, but it still should have had more time,finally JBL lost his title, but to john cena? why? 3/5Batista VS HHH-world title-good main event, hhh gets extremely bloody again. it was a good way to end a great Wrestlemania !!!"

5,A Book for Life,"This marvelous book came into my life almost twenty years ago and remains my favorite book to this day. I have reread many sections many times, and even with the advances in science that have arisen since the publication of this book, it remains deeply informative and philosophically rewarding. For all those who seek to investigate life on earth from its many facets, this is a book to treasure. I only wish Guy Murchie had lived long enough for me to thank him personally!"
4,Wonderfully taken,"This book has great depth into facts of life many often set aside in the canyons of the mind. The fact that it is an excellent science book is only surpassed by also being a deep look into the philospies of life. It should be required reading for all college bound students. Mr. Murchie has a vocabulary suited to the tasks be undertakes discussing, it is an extensive book and wont be read in one sitting, but nights one wishes to pass the hours well spent it is a worthy read. I will read ""The Seven Mysteries Of Life"" again and again cherishing it with an ever renewed fevor for all its subjects. Thank you Mr. Murchie for your effors here."
5,Mind Expanding,A comprehensive guide to our earthly existence - Guy Murchie loves his subject and has devoted himself to explaining the richness and complexity of our milieu and beyond. A book that can be opened to any page and read with fascination. Murchie is something of a mystic-poet-scientist. This is a book I plan to give to friends and family as gifts. My first fascination was with the description of a tree from inside out. Never preachy or moralistic - the book is profound in its wealth of detailed explanations and speculation.
3,The Problems of Translation!,"This endearing, wise little book is a must for all Rilke fans. Parables and fables, this book is a great companion to Letters to a Young Poet. Cozy and contemplative like sitting inside a room watching snow fall through a window, these stories are small miracles of faith and love and devotion. However, this book reads much better in the German than it does in this translation. I believe this is the only known English translation and it does not do Rilke's poetic prose justice. That is the problem with translation - the reader is a victim to the translator. Think of all the horrible translations of Dante that existed before Charles Singleton took the poem into his hands. Or the Aeneid or the Odyssey before Robert Fitzgerald.Nonetheless, this is an important book for those who love the quiet that lies in-between the lines of Rilke's writing. Hopefully, someone like Stephen Mitchell will try their hands at this. We can only hope."
3,Inconsistent.,"Half of this recording sounds terrific while the other half is spoiled by over-production. Le Orme sounded as if they were trying to stay relevant within the quickly changing music scene of the late seventies. It's a shame, as they were still capable of recording some outstanding progressive music. The weaker cuts are just too poppy and have little to say musically or otherwise. This one is comprable to Smogmagica, another weaker effort. Still worth the listen, just not essential...Simon"
1,never buy solaray once daily high energy multivitamin,I bought the solaray once daily high energy multivitamin and it made me feel like crap!! never buy this again!
5,The greatest boning knife you will ever own.,This knife is so sharp! It cuts like a scalpel. You can really feel the difference in quality in a Shun Elite knife and any other knife. The SG-2 steel really makes a difference.
5,If you are not moved by any of Ellison's stories or essays..,"... than you simply do not posses the ability to be moved. Harlan Ellison has written over 1700 stories encompassing over 60 books. His best stories and essays open you up to the man's heart. He is brutally honest and always has an opinion. It's hard to put his writing under science fiction because although he has written many SF stories; he has also written horror, dark fantasy, ""mainstream"" fiction and of course, non-fiction. In the end, these classifications are just to place the book somewhere to make the bookseller's life a bit easier. This is the book to get if you are new (what took you so damn long?) to Ellison. It will introduce to some of his best stories and burning critical essays. He is without a doubt one of the best living short story writers we have. Get it and prove me wrong! -E.L."
5,THE Best introduction to the BEST writer.,"From his first short story to his latest, Mr. Ellison has been on a journey of perfecting the written word. Anytime anyone has asked me for a recommendation for a ""novice's"" Ellison book, I've steered them towards The Essential Ellison. Having been informed that Mr. Ellison would be appearing at the 1994 Chicago ComiCon, and having not read his work for a few years, I thought it best to obtain this book (to bring myself somewhat up-to-date!); Harlan's book helped me through a bad bout of the flu....it's a fantastic read! Highly recommended by Elizabeth A. Kowols"
4,Sci Fi's Angry Young Man,"He's been raging for years. Star trek and outer limits episodes, the short story he claims (with much vigor.) was the basis for the terminator.He is a man from a bygone age who writes with a passion that is not found today. Some of the best short stories to be found (I have no mouth and I must scream)flow from his pen. A man worthy of a retrospective.think of that!Gideon's Fall: When You Dont Have a Prayer, Only a Miracle Will Do"
5,"Truly ""Essential""",A well organized collection of Ellison's work. Great entertainment (as well as being a valuable reference source). It also serves as a brilliant jumping point for those new to Harlan's writing. Get it. Read it. Read it again and again
5,This is essentail...,"If you've ever wondered what was missing from your science fiction writing, or any science fiction writing in general, this book holds those ideas. Ellison's works in this book, regardless if you like sci-fi or not, give the reader a little better view of everything."
2,good effort,"""purity disrupted"" needs some lyrics, and ""decay"" needs some kind of explosive ending, you wait for something to happen, and it never does. Not enough changes in this music. I like the dark sound, too repetative though."
5,Bloody Maiden ROCKS,"Everyone needs this CD!!!! Bloody Maiden is one talented mofo. If you are into the dark and twisted, YOU MUST BUY!!!!!!!"
5,A Great Commentary,This is a very informative and detailed commentary on the Book of Revelation written from a premillennial dispensationalist viewpoint. I have found this commentary to be extremely useful for my study and for my teaching. I highly recommend this volume (chapters 1-7) and also volume 2 (chapters 8-22). I highly recommend this commentary.
2,Too stubby,It really is short with no built in ability to extend. For desk interviews you have to hunch way over. Pay more for the extra few inches!
3,"Lucid, informative, definitely parts the veil on Tantric Thelema.","This book was, for many years, one of the most lucid books written on heterosexual Tantric sex magick available, particularly of the Thelemic current, and three decades later, it's still *quite* informative. But Mr. Grant unfortunatley exposed his homophobia in this book, and wrote disparagingly about Crowley's infamous, alleged (and admittedly possibly spurious) XI Degree. However, IS almost 30 years since Grant originally wrote this, so perhaps his prejudices concerning homosexual magickal workings, and those who work them, has softened.Grant has the tendency to get a little loopy and self-referential (as well as self-reverential) in some of his other works, but largely sticks to the points here. This is the Skoob Book 2nd edition; a 3rd edition will be released by Starfire Press in the near future, those students not wishing to invest $100+ would be well advised to wait for its re-publication later this year in 2012."
2,Unintelligible in any language,"I bought the English translation, because we are studying this work in a Spanish literature class, and I found it to be very difficult going. Turns out that it wasn't the Spanish that was the problem, it was the ""novel""!! It is a confusing and obscurantist navel-gazing exercise, which is, however, full of clever and witty asides, and insights into life in Franco's Spain. Why should anybody want to read a book about the writer writing a book, which is probably the very same book that s/he now holds in his or her hand? Narcissism is not a compelling trait."
1,Not made of tire material,"I love the noise this toy makes as does my dog, but it is not chew friendly. In fact, I have no clue what it is made of? I thought I might be breakable because it feels like some sort of porcelain. My dog won't play with it. I wish it was made of tire material for his chewing. Would not buy again :("
4,Good Documentary,"The footage with Sunny, Luna, and Moolah/Mae Young is well worth the price of this DVD. The matches included are of varying video quality, with the Luna vs. Alicia hardcore match standing out as the best one included. Another excellent offering from RFVideo/Big Vision."
3,Heavy Metal meets Dancehall Reggae...,"Instead of fusing metal and rap these guys have interestingly fused metal and dancehall reggae. This is not my music but I can say that they succeed so if you are into Living Colour, Deftones, The Bad Brains or Korn this might work for you. They even do a cover of The Clash's ""The Fear""."
5,ROCKS!,An awesome mix between reggae and metal.Don't forget the hidden track it starts at 7:15 on track 17 its the best song on the album.
1,WTF is this?!,"This garbage would make Bob Marley roll over in his grave. These guys can't decide whether they want to be nu-metal or poorly done reggae. So they mash them both together, creating this unholy mess. How the other version of this CD got a 5 star rating, I don't know. The vocals are grating to the ears, the lyrics are stupid, and the guitar is all power chords. And they spell in ebonics! How stupid is that? More importantly, who the hell thought they deserved a record deal?!If you want a good blend of metal and tribal themes, listen to Max Cavalera-era Sepultura."
4,"Unlike anything else, but in a good way","The thing with Skindred is you are never really sure what they are trying to do, because they're doing everything. What's more, they're doing everything right.The music is constantly shifting in tone and feel. One second it's hard metal, the next rock, and then it suddenly gets a real ragga/reggae vibe to it. And it's much the same with the vocals. They switch between high and low, rough and soft, on a regular basis. Then there's the lyrics, definate (and innately incomprehensible, yet drawing) Jamaican patios.It's a true mixture of genre's which seems like a bit of a handful, but works much better than you might expect. They are not like any other group, because they blend too many different styles.They create the type of magic that when you hear one of their tracks for the first time, you instantly know it could be no one else."
3,New Approach,"Skindred is a cool band that showed up out of nowhere onto the music scene. They are extremely creative with the mix of punk rock, hiphop, and reggea music. It's something new to listen to and an awsome cd. I recommend sampling this cd before you buy it because it's not for everyone. Try the songs ""Nobody"" and ""Pressure."""
5,"Great, original","I have listened to this cd, well... most of it, and it is very original. Very creative. I like the use of backing vocals. Although, i will have to disagree with the first personthe wrote a review. Hatebreed sux but Mudvayne is great. Check them out also, they have a new cd comming out."
2,Novelty Vs Substance.,"I dabble in reggae, ragga, ska and reggaeton and I am a die hard metal and hardcore fan so when I heard about a group that was delving into a genre that had only been hinted at by other artists (eg. Soulfy; who worked with Benji on their 1st album. As well as Molotov; ""Rastamandita"") , I jumped at the chance to check them out. I admit that the novelty value is high but after the 2nd and 3rd time you hear the album it reveals itself for what it trully is; overproduced, sickeningly melodic ear candy. This is just my opinion BUT if i had heard this album five or six years ago, when my taste was less advanced i would probably have rated it highly.This album proves why bands should not sacrifice artistry and durability for the sake of commercialism. Avoid it at all costs."
2,"Slightly original, but no good","Skindred's album ""Babylon"" really fails to delivier. From the first track (and mostly throughout the entire album) you know that this group is no better then any other hard rock band like Linkin Park and Disturbed. They attempt to add some sort of originality by dubbing in some synths and some half-baked horn lines. But in spite of this, Skindred still just sounds like another generic 90's-00's hard rock band.This is no more evident in their lyrics (which seem to be written in some sort of ""ebonics"" language in the liner notes)like this tasteful little line:""Know this ones dedicated to the police dem you know LiarCause some of them is wicked and them good for nothingAnd dem love pick upon peopleAnd dem think der no rightAnd I man come to show you dat""that was taken straight out of the liner notes which begs the question: Did these guys even get out of 5th grade, cuz a 5th grader could write better lyrics about a more tasteful subject then these guys could."
1,Awful Stuff,I heard this band on XM and couldn't believe how bad they sounded. Friend of mine actually purchased the CD so I did give it a listen and it is the worst cd I have ever heard. It is so bad it is almost funny. Do Not Buy This Album. Wanted to rate it 0 stars
3,"Workmanlike Photography, Boring Book","The photography appears to be done within a short time and by someone intent on putting his particular spin on his subject. Unfortunately, the consequence is that none of the pictures qualify as stunning. They photography is very competent and has wonderful color saturation, but the compositions left me cold. None of them had points of interest or hints of an underlying story that typifies the best photography.The photographer also decided to concentrate on close-up landscape, thus, there's relatively little coverage on the waterfalls and wildlife that Iceland is known for. Even worse, many images look very similar to each other, and most did not make me want to visit Iceland or re-read this book. I have seen far superior Iceland photography posted for free viewing on Flickr."
3,Pretty but not complete,The pictures in this book are gorgeous pieces of art. If you are looking for a book that offers a peek into the full range of Icelandic nature then this is not the book. The cover shot is a good representation of what the rest of the photos are like.
4,"Iceland, in Photos","This book is full of gorgeous photos that capture Iceland's otherworldly landscapes - lakes, falls, ocean, mountains, etc. I bought the book because I had just traveled to Iceland and thought it would be nice to have. It did not disappoint. The only negative thing about the book is that a lot of the better known (re: touristy) areas aren't represented. It would have been nice to see more of the locations I'd been to in the pages of this book. However, that's clearly not a big deal. Overall, I would say that the beauty of the photos in the book make it well worth the purchase!"
2,Dull,"I checked out this book in its audio format - the female voices made you want to cringe, which I did a few times.Then there is the writing... Having an idea of where the story is going is expected, but knowing what each reaction to a situation is another. It was way to predictable and Chase character was more along the lines of a stereotypical weak female, not of a strong, intelligent and dominant male. I forwarded through most of it cause I had already figured out what had happened and was right each time."
1,One of the worst romance novels I've ever read,"First of all, this book was horribly written. All the lines coming out of the characters mouths were cheesy and predictable. This woman is not a writer. Next, the whole premise for the book is unrealistic. The big secret a presidential candidate had to hide was that he'd adopted a child... Wow, what a horrible thing to do. The idea that the politician's staff would then try and kill the biological father to erase the problem is stupid. After many books read, this is the first time I've felt compelled to write a review. This is how bad this book is."
3,"Fun, Light and Intriguing!!!","This is a fun, light and intriguing story.A young woman, daughter of a future Presidential candidate, overhears a conversation that involves her background and her birth. She is fraught with emotion and takes off to discover what the facts are. She becomes involved with a young man who has decided that it is time for him to live his own life and to stop being a ""caretaker"" for others.As it turns out, the young man is also an independent journalist who has taken on the job of keeping an eye on someone as a personal favor.......he has no idea that it is the young woman he has just met at a bar the week before.What follows is an unexpected dangerous search, leading to near tragedy and throwing these two people into a whirlwind of danger and deception.......and pushing them closer and closer to each other."
4,Great read,I stumbled on the first book of this series in the library and from there on I was hooked. I like how the stories of the brothers are developed. In this book the story seem more real and it's great. It's a great read when you don't have anything to do or you want to relax.
4,A great read!,"What a perfect ending to an excellent series. This book had mystery, action and of course romance. Twists that just made it a super story. I highly recommend the whole series."
5,Great Book,I LOVED all of these books. It was a very fast and enjoyable read. I liked how it brought all of the stories from all three books to an end.
3,The Third In The Chandler Brothers Series!,Since I've read the previous two books in this series I waited anxiously wait for this one to be released in paperback. The second it hit my military bookstore I picked it up. I must admit to some disappointment here. Chase was a good hero. In fact I have been waiting to read his story since he was the one that appealed to me the most. Sloane on the other hand really didn't do it for me as his match. I think it may be like a previous reviewer stated she ran hot/cold but missed anything in-between. From this point on this book followed your standard romance formula read. As a result I felt just a little cheated. Perhaps if I had not read the previous two titles I would not have had such great expectations. Still this is worth giving a read and I look forward to reading Ms. Phillips again.
1,Standard romance,"This is my third book to read of Carly Phillips and will be my last. The books that I have read are awful. Because of the ratings, at first I thought it was just I, but it's not. Everyone is beautiful and shallow, which is your typical, standard, safe romance novel. I doubt that this author will ever write beyond her safety net. Chase was okay, but the drooling over Sloan was overkill. Also, what is it with this author when comes to eyes. ""His gaze keenly centered on hers, his intelligent eyes or his blue eyes met hers, deep and questioning."" I didn't know they still wrote things like that. Body language, yes, but I've never understood a person or their intent by gazing into another person's eyes. Facial expression - yes, eyes - no. I wish I would have known before I bought this book that this author is geared more toward teens and young adults..."
3,Three and a half stars,"I just finished The Heartbreaker, the last in a series of three. Make sure you read the first two (The Bachelor and The Playboy) first. This one gives away the endings of those books. Although this wasn't my favorite story about the Chandler boys, it was still a good book and I'm sad that it's over. I have been engrossed in their lives for the last 1000 or so total pages. If you have read the first two books, this is a must read, even though the love story isn't terrific and there seems to be a lot of drama in this one. But throughout the book you find out more about Roman and Rick's lives, along with closure for everyone's lives at the end. This series has made me a Carly Phillips fan and I look forward to reading her other books."
3,Not a bad light read! 3.75 stars !,"The latest in the brother series by Carley Phillips is again a fun read. She creates a great strong woman character for Chase, which he would need to stay interested in someone.Sloane is dealt a horrible blow when she overhears that she might not be the person she thinks she is and have another father out in the wings. This shakes her and off she heads to find out the truth. But, there are those that want to stop her.This story is more of a romantic suspense book that a traditional romance which is a good thing in my opinion. It allows you to take part in the story and root for different characters. If you are looking for a rather quick read this is a good story for you to enjoy!"
2,It was okay,"This read like a predictable love story I don't like it it when the characters it on right after they meet, it cheapens the characters and the story line."
5,Excellent book. Recommended.,"This book has a good balance between experimental and computational methods. It provides a description of DNA microarray technologies, experimental protocols, and the multiple sources of noise and variability. The book contains an insightful overview of the computational issues and available algorithms for data analysis from differential expression, to dimensionality reduction and visualization (e.g. PCA), to clustering (e.g. hierarchical). New methods are described to gether with a good overview of available software, data bases, web sites, and other resources, as well as several ""walk through"" examples. I particularly enjoyed the last chapter on Systems Biology."
4,Great book for teaching a lesson,"Scaredy Bear has a problem. He really likes Pig, but he is too scared to even talk to her. The other people in the town think that Bear is a little stuck up, as he doesn't open up to anyone. Bear is great at playing his Banjo, but when invited to play with Pig he gets too scared and tells everyone that he cannot do it. This book doesn't really end happily... Bear cannot overcome his fear to play so he misses out on making new friends. It is a good lesson for parents to talk through with their kids who are either afraid of talking to someone, or even reasons that others are shy sometimes. My Daughter loves this book and loves to say scaredy Bear. It is definitely not my favorite of the series, but I am glad I own it."
2,Book Club Version,This was a book club version therefore smaller than the rest of the series (not stated in the description). Otherwise ok.
2,"listen to me, and not them!","ok, here's the scoop. the first part of the movie is ok, indy proposes to a girl named molly and they're going to get married. then she dies and indy gets all sad. ok for watching. but don't get this movie because of the second part. the ""scary"" part is so stupid and cheesy, you can even laugh at it. the second part is so bad, you should only get this video to complete your collection!"
5,Another exciting adventure for Indiana Jones,"I own almost all of the Indiana Jones movies and I think this is one of the best, it has action, drama, romance, betreyal, and horror. Indiana Jones is better to be a spy in World war 1 anyway and in this one he is a great one. I always like movies were not everybody survives only the strongest survive. That's what happend in Mask of Evil, in the mission to Transelvainia 5 people went in and only 2 came out I like that in a movie. This is one of the best Indiana Jones movies there is. Trust me."
1,Definitely not for young children,"After reading another review on this site (gypsy18, 5/31/01), I was shocked to see that the reviewer's child had the exact same reaction, almost word-for-word, as did my son. He was equally upset that such violence could have come from the mind of George Lucas.This video was in the children's section of the store, and it had a ""family"" label stuck right on it. We asked the store to remove the label, as it is NOT appropriate."
1,THIS EPISODE ABSOLUTELY NOT FOR CHILDREN!,"The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones is an extraordinarily well done series. My son, age 8, just loves it. But it was a mistake buying MASK OF EVIL. My son (usually a tough little guy) was almost physically ill from a particularly bloody scene (although the violence was performed behind a curtain). He had trouble sleeping & actually started crying in the middle of the day from the trauma of remembering this scene! He said, ""Mom, I wish we'd never bought this one."" My son also said, ""Mom, why did George Lucas let this one be unrated? That was bad!"" Out of the mouths of babes! Vampires are just too violent a subject for children I think (& some adults, including me)!"
4,Test Taking Strategies,This book arrived a week earlier than expected. It has some good information on taking tests. Some new ideas. Overall a good book.
2,Not small and not light,"This is an Olympus hard drive docking station:* 40GB storage capacity* CPU equipped* Size: 5""Wx5""Lx5/64H""* Weight: 10 oz."
4,A Builder of Centers of Excellence in Mathematics,"This is a book that would interest people who enjoy reading books about the history of mathematics, particularly about the communities and and institutions of mathematics. The period covered is from the late 19th Century. Courant was student and later, a colleague of the famous mathematician Hilbert at Gottingen. Courant is obviously not as famous as Hilbert and the book does not focus on his achievements in mathematics. Instead, it discusses more about how he relates to other mathematicians, and his tireless efforts in trying to establish and nurture two centers of excellence in mathematics - the Mathematical Institute at Gottingen and the Courant Institute of Mathematics at New York."
2,Bias,A fairly good book but crowded with the author's bias towards clinical research and the various regulatory agencies responsible for oversight.
5,A Must-Have for New Babies,"I got this on a recommendation from a friend and several of my friends have bought it since seeing mine. The Snuzzler is the perfect product for keeping newborns comfy and safe in their infant carseat. My son (who was over 8 lbs) was very comfortable. His little head never flopped around and the body cushions filled the extra space in the carseat (a Graco Snugride) when he was tiny (and he didn't seem like he was too upright at all). Since it's two pieces that are velcroed together, I was able to remove the body portion as my son grew and leave the head support. I love that each side has a different type of fabric for warmer/cooler months and it washes wonderfully because it's so well made. Once we didn't need it in the carseat anymore, we used it in our jogger stroller for added comfort. The Snuzzler is a fantastic product - I wouldn't consider using anything else!"
5,"very good, but similar to other text","This book is an extended version of Master Choe's other book, Hap Ki Do The Korean Art of Self Defense. The new book is arranged a little better and includes more text on philosophy, training and teaching techniques. This book is a great reference and is worth getting, even if you already have the other book."
3,um.,"has a few good ""one liners"" in it, some basic concepts on his personal training experiences. title is deceiving, A Guide to Black Belt Studies is simply misleading. I have been doing HKD for more than 20 years, so it has little to offer me or other instructors. NOT for advanced or especially Black Belts; it's designed for a new student to Hapkido."
5,Something to pass on for generations!!,Such a wonderful toy. It is very well built and is a toy I hope to pass down to future generations!
1,Where's the Kindle edition?,"Just read the first in the series.....I got hooked with the first chapter of Death of Riley. Went to purchase it for my Kindle and ..... no Kindle edition. Big disappointment, that's why I gave it one star!"
3,Lots of luck,"Good stories with a very nice young lady, who has a little more luck as investegator than one could expect. Although she takes her time to solve the main cases, she experience some interesting adventures and people as she goes. Lokking foreward to read more about Molly."
4,Mystery,"If you are tired of multiple murders instead of plot this is just the book for you! Well drawn characters, excellent understanding of the era and the place -- (1890's Greenwich Village). The main character is delightful, although she gets away with much more than most women in the era would have.Have read several others of this series and enjoyed them all. Not alot of redrawing of characters in each new book.A good quick read... The mystery is reasonably ploted out, although the who in the who done it could have appeared more often...Delicious mind candy"
3,"simple, light read","I was intrigued by the time frame and book jacket description of Molly. This is a simply written detective story that should appeal to those who want some light reading. I grew annoyed with the frequent usage of cliches, and inner monologue of Molly. She came off as predictable (firey, red haired Irish woman, gutsy,yet gullible but trying to be worldly), and most of the characters were not that interestingly drawn. I didn't find Ms Bowen's writing style engaging. I skimmed the last third of the book and didn't feel like I missed anything. It's ok for a light diversion, but there are many more accomplished writers out there."
4,fiction,"These are OK - I like the Royal books better, but these do well. Interesting to see the difference of societies views on women and men here."
3,Not as interesting as I'd hoped,"I guess I was expecting something more in-depth and less instructional. I am sure this is a fine book for a parent who isn't clued into how some kids are popular and some kids have no friends at all, but I was looking for a more psychological perspective.I did find the short sections about infants and toddlers very interesting. I think there should have been less emphasis on popularity and what it means to children. The section about people acting a certain way because of a group mentality rather than personal morals captured my attention."
5,Worst Enemies/ Best Friends Beacon Street Girls,"Hi,My name is Taylor. I read Beacon Street Girls. It was a really great book. You never knew what to expect next. It was so interesting I could hardly put it down. It is a good book for any age girl. I felt like I was one of the Beacon Street Girls. I could see myself there. It is a perfect book for every girl. It has all the personalities of every girl, so anyone can relate to it. The book kept me guessing throughout the entire story. Even when I put it down I kept wondering what was going to happen next. I would highly recommend this book to any girl of any age. I know you will enjoy this and be glad you read it. I hope you will be as excited as I to read the next book and tell your friends."
2,remixes not that great...,"Being a HUGE Air fan, I have to say that I was disappointed in the Sexy Boy single after listening to the remixes and discovering that they are nowhere near as interesting as the original version. Especially the Beck remix, which I had high expectations about, for obvious reasons. However, the other b-side, Jeanne, is great- a vocal tune (most of Air's stuff is instrumental) that has that familiar, more mainstream, less experimental French-love-song feel to it. It can also be found on the Pop Romantique: French Pop Classics compilation CD. If you're a diehard Air fan like me, it's definately worth getting, but otherwise, pass."
5,Easy setup and Storage,"This product is easy to setup, and collapses easily. It stores like a large pipe, and takes up little space. It is well designed, is stable, and adjusts to different heights. I think I should have gotten the tote bag that is available with it. The tote bag would help to keep the pieces that slide clean."
4,Deadbeat - Wild Life Documentaries,"Deadbeat's debut for ~scape, WILD LIFE DOCUMENTARIES, actually deals little with wildlife at all -- at least in terms of wild beasts. What it deals with in great amounts is dub, and plenty of it. The reverb comes on heavy, and blended with some IDM sounds (long tones, glitchy background noises), it works quite well. ""Organ in the Attic Sings the Blues"" sounds like reggae for a slowly-moving robot, while ""Cause for Hope"" is perfect for head-nodding. The reggae on this album is particularly pronounced, which at times can be a drawback. At times, Deadbeat leans too much on the rhythm, which can leave the other musical aspects empty. But the quiet voices and phased keyboards on ""To Berlin with Love"" or the quick edits and lovely tones on ""When First You Gave Me Shivers..."" help alleviate the slower parts. ""Kezia"" closes the album with reverberating warmth. A mellow album for mellow moods."
5,Horse Cookie Cutter,The horse cookie cutter was promptly delivered and works great. Wish it had more of a tail on the cookie cutter. I have so many cookie cutter but couldn't find horse or country western type cookies cutters until I searched on Amazon. My sister is a country girl so wanted to make her some fun cookies =)
1,I want my money back!,"I expected a little more than this... This book doesnt contain anything concrete, as if the author deliberately omit everything that is of real importance. Just look at the part about MACD. Way too vague, I get better insight on MACD by googling it out myself. If you seriously looking for a solid book about technical analysis, look else where! There are better ways to throw away money."
4,works good but small leak,"Unit works good but small leak created due to warping if you're using 6awg cable.The 6awg cable is difficult to bend @ quick 90 deg angle and pushes out front plate slightly.Quick fix was clear, outdoor silicon and it's been dry ever since."
4,Well made,"Well made water tight, doesn't stand out on side off house ,easy to use when kneeded,the one I had had rotted out this one seams that it will last longer"
3,Should have researched more,"It's ok, but I could have gotten a surface mount for the same or lower price. It's fine if you have brick or cinder block siding, but I ended up purchasing a different housing to flush mount the receptacle."
2,Bad Design,"This box is too small for 6 awg wire, which is needed for a 50 amp load. Working in this box is very uncomfortable and it took a lot of effort to close the lid (the box is closed by the metal is somewhat bent). Not worth the money."
4,"Easy Read, But Kindle conversion not so great","I enjoyed the book, and it was an easy read. Mostly I read nonfiction, and a lot of history so this story was interesting as it put perspective to the plight of Korea during and following the Japanese occupation. The only negative was that whatever process they used to put the book in electronic form didn't work very well. There are many words that are wrong, but you can figure out what it should be. Just a little distracting."
5,One of the best books I've ever read,"This book is a wonderful book about a Korean girl living under Japenese rule. The things that she sees astound me, but show the strength that even children have. A fictionalized account of what the author went through, this book is moving and will stay in your memory for a long time. By the way, if you have read and liked this book, read ""So Far From the Bamboo Grove"" by Yoko Watkins."
5,I really really really love this book!,"I read this wonderful book a long long time ago, but am still deeply movied by it. I really want to read this book again, but I could never for the life of me remember wh owrite it! Now I will definetly go look for tihs book in the library."
3,Try It Again for the First Time,"Saints and Friends, this is indeed a re-release. If you're in a slow reading, lighting candles on a rainy day kind of mood, this is the music for you. Kim's vocals on most of the songs are smooth and light as afternoon sun, and never leaves you rushed or gasping. Listen to this during quiet times and let the Lord bless you."
5,Pure entertainment!,"For those who enjoyed the movie, the game is a blast! My grandson plays it over and over. It's a fun game!"
1,Boo!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Just like most animated movie games, this game is not fun at all! Please don't even rent this game!"
4,My son loves it,"My son (just turned 6) rented this game from Blockbuster with a gift card. He has played it every day for a week. He really loves the characters and the action. I only gave it 4 stars because there are parts where you don't know what to do and if you can't make it through to the certain point then you start all over which requires listening to the characters talk (like part of the movie). This gets a bit tedious. It might have helped had the game included the booklet.Anyway, I would say, overall, that it is really fun for kids."
3,A good read if not great literature,I enjoy all of Anne Perrys' novels because of the historical setting and the mystery. I find many contemporary mysteries a little too explicit and scary but it's hard to get too scared when the setting is more than 100 years ago.
1,Library cast off cassettes and CDs.,"I've had very poor success with cast off Library CDs and Cassettes. They are worn out and usually there is at least one flaw that makes it impossible to get through the whole book without a sizable gap in the story. I've received ""Rutland Place"" twice. It took two books in order to hear the whole story. Both were Library cast off cassette books and both had a cassette that could not play through one or both sides. These cassette books are not worth the time, cost and trouble to return. Another problem was the inferior sound quality. It takes real concentration to understand what is being said. I have some new cassettes that have great sound. Other than that it's a very good story as are all of Anne Perry's books. It's too bad the old ones are not more often reissued. I buy all of my audio books through Amazon."
2,Poor quality reproduction of favorite,"Anne Perry has been one of my favorite authors for many, many years. I was delighted to see that the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series is available on Kindle. However, as I am re-reading the old favorites, I am very disappointed by the poor reproduction quality of the entire series. Many words are misspelled through obvious optical character recognition errors. The price of each book warrants at least a proofread of the content. My rating is based on this issue; a review of the writing and storyline would be much, much higher."
1,Review Questions for MRI,Do not buy this book. The questions are way too easy and will prepare you little for the boards. Better to place you money in another review book.
3,If your taking the Registry....Its not really worth it,"The sections on MRI Patient Care, Safety, Equipment, and Some of the general concepts on Pulse Sequences were good -- and similar to the Registry. But....the Anatomy and Physics questions were way too easyand much simpler than the Registry. Not Recommended. This is a generaland basic review but nothing more. Explanations are lacking and the book needs updating."
3,Review Questions for MRI,"Received this book a few weeks before I took the MRI exam. I passed but did not feel that this book was terribly helpful for the price. I was expecting some large form of review and all I received was this tiny book with many of the questions not giving an indepth answer, which would have been helpful."
3,"Ok, but there are better.","I bought this book in the hope to learn some new guided imagery that I could use to relax me during labor, and during pregnancy. The book is one of those books that is just ok, not life-changing. When you read it you don't really have any ""aha"" moments. The CD that comes with it was ok, but not that special. I have found Belleruth Naparstek's CDs to be by far the most transformative. Her CDs make me SO relaxed! Even the heartburn and swelling seem to calm down after I've relaxed to her CD for about 45 minutes. Also, I find that during the weeks that I do her CD I have a more positive outlook and I can cope with things better. The pregnancy hormones seem much more dark and difficult to deal with when I get busy and don't do the CD. I like her ""Pregnancy and Childbirth"" CD, as well as her ""Relaxation and Wellness"" one. If you had a traumatic birth experience or pregnancy in the past, her PTSD CD is really powerful. Hope this helps someone!"
3,Wasn't for me,"I went into this with an open mind, and there were a lot of things I agreed with in the early parts of the book. I can see how a lot of this would be useful to all women, however the author lost me with one glaring contradiction - she says early on in the book that birth is not painful if the mother is relaxed and that only fear causes pain, yet later in the book there are many techniques to hypnotize yourself to not feel pain, including how to distribute a sense of numbness to chosen places of your body. Uh, if it's not painful, why do we need to spent so much time learning how to distance our minds from the pain?This technique is also a lot of work. I don't doubt that for women willing to put the time and effort in it would be effective, but for me personally it's excessive.There's also a lot of unnecessary fluff, for example, I don't believe that down-to-earth educated women need a separate birth language that is less frightening."
2,Didn't help much,"I used the hypnobirthing method with my daughter, and unfortunately it didn't work for me. I practiced with the CDs my entire pregnancy, and they did help me sleep better and to relax. I slept great almost my whole pregnancy, and I do give credit to the CDs for that. I even hired a doula, who got certified in Hypnobirthing in time for my delivery, but I didn't really feel that it was very helpful once my labor started. When my contractions started, they were painful. The book refers to ""pressure"" but I definitely felt pain. I tried listening to the CDs, getting on the birthing ball, and doing some meditation, but nothing made it more comfortable. For me, labor hurt! It went downhill from there. Severe pain in the hospital so I requested an epidural, ended up getting pitocin, and then finally delivered via C-section. Now with my second child, I am considering a VBAC and looking into Hypnobabies, which I hear prepares you much better."
3,Should be supplemented with therapy sessions,I got this book unfortunately in my 38th week of pregnancy. Wish I had gotten before hand. I loved the theory behind book. Didn't get to finish it as the baby did arrive soon after.
3,Some people swear by this book...,"So many women swear by this book, so I'm giving it a 4-star rating. In fact, basically everyone I know who had a natural birth considers this to be the bible for natural and home births.For me, however, it was boring, repetitive and trite. Downright preachy and sometimes cocky. Basically implying that if you can't get on board with the program, then something is wrong with you. And that tone, I frankly found offensive.If you are someone who can meditate, then this book will help you take the skills you already have and apply them to childbirth.If you are someone who can't, then really just forget it. Trying to learn how to meditate, and to meditate so deeply, seems like a really difficult task to undertake, perhaps impossible, especially if you have 10 months, assuming you started reading it the very day you got pregnant. It will frustrate you to no end, make you feel inadequate, scare you about your upcoming birth experience, and be a total waste."
4,"Terrible title, good book!","I found out this book pretty far in to my pregnancy and my daughter arrived early, about a week after I finished reading the book, but I can say, without reservation, that the information I learned, just by reading the book one time and practicing with my husband twice, that it was a great help while I was in labor. I was not without pain, but I was very calm and in control. I just wish I had had more time to practice the techniques!"
3,Some good take-away points.,"(I only read a portion of this book.) This book is a bit ""out there"" saying that childbirth does not have to be painful (riiiight) but there are some great things that I learned in regards to how to relax. I also learned about the uterine muscles and how they work. This really helped me visualize what the different sets of muscles were doing during each contraction. I feel this helped make my contractions, or surges as they call them, more productive. This book and ""The Idiot's Guide to Natural Childbirth"" were good sources and what I read helped me with my 6-hour natural birth. The experience was a blessing and the knowledge I acquired prior to the birth was very helpful."
2,Meh,I wanted a ntural birth experience but found the bradley method book to be much more helpful in my opinion.
4,Helpful,"I read most of the book. Tried to get into a class but it was full. I thought the best part about the book was the philosophy. Truly our beliefs and expectations flavor our experiences, I have known this before, but it was nice to have this book to encourage me to continue using this knowledge to help me through my birth. However, the excercises seemed to be nothing more than relaxation techniques that I have already learned. Although I'm pretty sure that I would have benefited more from the book if I had practiced them anyways. The extra material not related to hypnobirthing in the book was kind of boring because I have read it elsewhere in numerous books. As for the birth, I certainly haven't mastered the mind control that this technique requires yet, but to the extent that I have I benifited. Now that I know what I need next time I know I will do even better."
3,Not all that,"I don't know what I was expecting out of this book, MAGIC? I read the whole book and when back to study it a few times before hand but when it came time for the real thing I found I couldn't focus on anything :("
3,I expected more.,This book is not bad but I did expect a little more training on preparing myself for labor. The book does share techniques on how to relax and breathe during labor but I have a feeling when the pain comes at full force that these techniques won't be that helpful.
2,Load of crap,"I bought this thinking I would give it a shot. I'm pregnant with my 3rd child and tried different methods with the first two. I got about halfway through and had to put it down. It's complete nonsense. Yes, most people could give birth unassisted if they had to, but it is certainly not pain-free. Her examples about animals and people in comas are nonsense. I would not recommend it."
2,Full of missing info.,"This is a good book if you are thinking about taking the actual class. A lot of sections in this book refer to ""when you go to the class"" or ""the items you will go over in class"" or ""the techniques you will learn in class."" This book assumes that the buyer is also going to take the class. I bought the book because I didn't want to pay $400 for the class.It is probably a better companion to the class than a stand-alone book. It's almost useless without the class."
3,"Not great, but still useful","I thought that this book would tell me the specific techniques of the HypnoBirthing process, but it really only vaguely describes them. You have to take the classes to really benefit from the techniques... I didn't have the money or free time to go. However, I found the theories of the book to be very enlightening and helpful. I gave birth to my second child using HypnoBirthing and was extremely satisfied with my experience. While I did absolutely experience pain, I felt in control and calm and ready. The pain was compeltely manageable and productive - and I attribute that to the relaxed frame of mind this book helped me to achieve. An interesting read, and a good advocate of completely natural births. If the want the specifics though, skip the book and take the classes. (They give you one there)"
5,wonderful!,"When I read this book I was about 5.5 months along. I immediately switched over all my prenatal care at 6 months to a midwife and did a home birth. This book helped educate me on the process our bodies go through and how to labor, which most women neglect to research. They go in with the mindset to just ""go with the flow""...which is hard if you don't know what to expect in that flow! I had an amazing birth experince, all at home, no complications. Bought the rainbow CD and had it on repeat the entire time. I can't wait to have another baby (and labor!) to experince that high again. I also wanted to say that this is the one of the first times I have ever written a review on anything...and am happy to do so to spread the word!"
1,About 10 pages about hypnobirthing in the whole book,"The book is an anti establishment, anti science rant until page 170 when suddenly the author wakes up, writes ten pages about hypnobirthing then resumes the rant. The method might work to relax after a tough day at work... Leave the pain management to the docs, othrwise we will have root canals with hypnosis..."
2,HypnoBirthingThe Breakthrough Natural Approach,No New material . Seems like she has read and listened to Dr Leclaire O'Neill. This is a repeat of all that I had read elsewhere.
1,Guilt Trip - 74 hours of labor - almost lost mom and baby,"I feel so guilty for having bought this book for my expecting daughter. She refused medication because of this books influence. She was exhausted after 74 hours of labor and had to be put on oxygen. This book has put a wall up between my son-inlaw and me. He saw his daughter born blue and has been devestated by it for not standing up against it. I was also told that this book refers alot to a class or training not really explaining issues.The doctors know best, please listen to themDO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!"
2,simply not worth it; feels like a way to sell birthing classes,"if it wasn't for the breathing and the talk about staying calm and focused, I'd give this book 1 star. Its terrible. What's sad is that I agree hospitals do get it wrong for most standard pregnancies. However I dislike the anti medical establishment that runs through the book and I greatly detest the implication that if you don't succeed at the methods in this book its your fault for not trying hard enough. She really glosses over anything that could go wrong and when she does confront it she blames the hospitals for everything. Or the mother. She seems to forget that in the good ol' days, a lot of women actually died in child birth. And in fact a lot of women still do. I really do think that the method was designed to simply sell the birthing classes.For an infinitely better book on natural birthing, read anything by Ina May."
3,"Eh, not so great.","She has a very judgmental attitude that put me off and discouraged me from finishing the book. I.e., you're told over and over that if you do the method right, you'll feel absolutely no pain... But of course, the flip side of that argument is that if you DO feel pain, it's somehow your fault. I prefer The Birth Book by the Sears, as it's much more ""different things work for different people; we help you find what works best for you."""
2,Only if you pay to take the class?,"I was so excited to read this book. I choose this over some of the other options because this seemed like the original source of the information. But as I started reading it, I started to feel manipulated. There are so many references in the book to ""what you will practice in class"". And there is even a part that states ""you will get these cue cards from your instructor"". I bought this book because I didn't have the $300 bucks to spend taking a live class and I don't appreciate that they sell it as a stand alone book, but that it is written as an accompaniement to a birth class.I didn't feel as though I got enough from the book alone to help me in any way and as I had already done a lot of reading on childbirth, none of the extra information was anything new to me.Skip this book. I wish I had."
3,A Let Down,"This book was somewhat useful and had some good tools and the cd was useful. However, it is quite upsetting when it starts to get into a subject, exercise, etc. and merely states ""you will learn more of this in your class"". Apparently you are supposed to use this book while taking a class. If only the authors and publishers let you know that before you order it."
3,Only Somewhat Helpful,"I found this book pretty late into my pregnancy (around 7 months). Don't get me wrong, the book has alot of great information and even some exercises you can try yourself. But my opinion is that to really benefit from hypnobirthing, you would need to take the actual classes to have an instructor teaching you and walking you through it. Many of the exercises described in the book were vague and I wouldn't have been sure if I was doing them correctly.I loved the general information the book has to offer about how our body reacts to fear, how to do pereneal massage, how to know when you may be close to beginning labor, etc...etc... All of that was great information and I'm glad I got the book. But unfortunately, I do not think I will use hypnobirthing during my labor this time around. I may consider taking the classes for my next child."
3,ok but neededmore,I bought this and then received The Hypnobirthing Bundle for Happy Hypnomoms and Blissful Hypnobabies . {baby shower gift} I found the Bundle new edition much easier and more comforting and professional.you could try them both but I thought The Bundle was a 5+ and actually all that was necessary . We didn't even take a childbirth class as the Leclaire hypnobirthing method was transforming.
1,what's all the fuss about this book?,"maybe the classes are more helpful, but this book is pretty much too general to be useful at all - there are no real exercises (i guess if you could learn it all from the book then who would shell out a few hundred for the class??)it's also pretty ridiculous to give women the idea that a painless childbirth is a reachable goal through this method. i think it's much more realistic to think about how to use breathing and hypnosis to MANAGE the pain.this book makes a lot of promises but definitely doesn't teach you enough about how to actually DO the method!"
3,A sure way to put you to sleep,"I listened to the CD before bed and fell asleep many night while pregnant. That was pleasant. An easier, more comfortable birth? Not really. But I wasn't totally hardcore with the book. I mostly just listened to the CD. I think if you want to do true Hypnobirthing, I would recommend a class."
3,Does this really work?,"I have not had my baby yet, so I havent actually tried the methods in this book. I have been trying to practice the techniques they give you, and so far have not experienced the hypnosis they are saying will happen. Maybe I just cant let go, I dont know. The book does however, give an excellent explaination of what is happening with your body and your baby during the labor and birthing process. I think it will help me a lot just knowing what my body is doing during labor will help out a lot."
3,HypnoBirthing review,I recommend this book to all who are pregnant! It gives an excellent new point of view to giving birth. This is especially helpful for those who are afraid of giving birth or scared of pain. This book hopefully will change their minds completely and see matters in a more positive light.
2,It won't work for everyone,"I felt the book itself gave me much more confidence in approaching my child birth experience, and I practiced the techniques and breathing from about my 4th month. However, my experience was that of a turned baby (facing back instead of forward) and yes the techniques helped me cope through 8 hours of relentless back labor... but in the end, it was an epidural and an experienced midwife who turned the baby. I got the natural delivery I wanted, but definitely not without immense pain - even though I was controlling my breathing until the end. My husband and I put off the intervention for longer than necessary - mostly due to my belief in this technique. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone (mine has been thrown out)."
2,not for single women,I listened to the CD as soon as I received this book in the mail and I was disapointed to find that it assumes a male partner. I found it very distracting during the meditation and haven't listened since. I would not recommend this book to single women or lesbian couples.
1,Caveat emptor,"Google the name ""Marie Mongan"" for a link to a judge's dismissal of a lawsuit brought by Marie Mongan against a nurse and childbirth educator. The linked documents offer valuable insights into the cult of HypnoBirthing and the character of the founder."
1,Not what I was expecting,"I have read many childbirth books and this one was the worst of them all. I am a first time mom and I cannot imagine ""floating on mists of colors"" during labor. I am not a pessimist but a realist. Childbirth is going to be uncomfortable(notice I did not use the word painful) and this book paints the picture that it is completely painless! Give me a break! I may have learned 1 valuable thing throughout the entire book. I am going to stick to ""Active Birth"" and ""Ina May's Guide to Childbirth"" which are more realistic books! This book just did not cut it for me!"
1,It goes a little something like this...,"It is kind of fishy that there are two reviews dated on the 8th! I am thinking it was the same person, pretending to be two different people? It is okay, we all do things like that. Let's keep America strong.Peace"
3,Who's Missing,"As a Who fanatic who has seen The Who 15 times in concert, Pete Townshend solo 4 times, and John Entwistle once since 1982, I know the history of the greatest rock 'n' roll band in the world didn't stop with the death of Keith Moon. Anyone who saw the Concert For New York in 2001 during which The Who were the best band to perform could see that. A quarter of a century of information is, therefore, omitted from this book. Dave Marsh made a similar mistake in downplaying the post-Moon era in his book, Before I Get Old. The story before Moon's death is great reading, though, and will serve to illuminate anyone's understanding of the first phase of The Who's legend."
4,I purchased this book for eight dollars!,"And it's a damn good copy too! I don't know what the WHO are really all about (but isn't that why they're the Who?) but I bought this thing because I am intrigued by the Who's motives on conquering their generations! You get to see wedding photos of John and Pete's wives, and Keith's hot blonde girl! But is Roger...never mind. I can't exlain how big this book is, although the Who aren't the Beatles because they are wild and violent and grossly unpredictable. But hey, their song ""Baba O'Reilly"" is hilarious!"
3,A good book for making sense of ad agencies,"If your firm is looking to hire an ad agency, it would be hugely beneficial to read this book. It will allow you to better understand how these agencies work and how to get your money's worth.Besides that, however, the book doesn't accomplish its goal of making it any easier to spot extraordinary advertising. The stories Mr. Silveira tells are fun and help put some fizz in the book. There are, however, no rules - hard or easy - that can predict what succeeds and what fails."
4,"""People who live in glass houses.....................""","I was lucky enough to get an advance copy of ""The Devil's Wind"" by Richard Rayner.The world of architecture brings in an environment that is different from most other novels and gives us a look at the lives of some interesting people. Throw in a dash of 1950's Las Vegas history and a story full of twists and turns and you have the basis for a good film-noir mystery.I can't wait to see the movie!"
3,Behavioral Interviewing,"This book is average. Its concepts are heavily based on Behavioral interviewing techniques that most corporate internal training will cover, with actual examples. If you are new to management or need a refresher to Hiring, first look into your jobs training curriculum. If its not there, then buy this book. If you are a HR Manager or someone that needs a companion, this book is a great guide."
2,Almost no SciFi,"A collection of short stories. The best story is the first one and you may as well stop reading the book afterwards. All the other stories have got weak plot lines. I often had the feeling FP was word-filling pages after pages without inspiration and was relieved by quickly getting the scattered pieces he had dropped along wrapped up in the last story. In a nutshell, a rather disappointing book."
1,CAUTION!,"Do not order this CD expecting a reissue of Brenda Lee's Decca album All Alone Am I. This is just another collection of her recordings and, as such, is in serious need of a track listing. Amazon has several better Brenda Lee collections for less money."
3,Not much to it,"If you don't know anything about Woolf, and just want a brief sketch of her life, then this film is fine. If you want an indepth, accurate biography, ""Famous Authors Series"" will disapoint every time. History Channel, National Geographic, and Nova are a little better than Famous Authors. PBS and Biography are much better. PBS is really the best."
4,Planning A Baby? How to Prepare for a Healthy Pregnancy,Informative and interesting. I plan to give this book to some relatives who are planning to have a baby soon.
3,Not as powerful as Marty Davitch's compositions,"I did enjoy the majority of the music on this cd. But being a fan of the Marty Davitch era (1970's-early 90's), I wasn't pleased. Don't get me wrong...many of these pieces are memorable to storyline's, but they are short in length and lack the power of Marty's work. There are a handful of tracks that have been used multiple times over a few years (i.e. 'Emergency Room', 'Sami', 'John and Marlena', etc.) but the rest seem to be specific to certain SHORT RUN s/l's. If you weren't into these specific s/l's they may be forgettable to you.I rated it a 3/5 because the music is good and at times it did bring back memories for me, but it is NOTHING compared to the earlier compositions. It lacks the PASSION of the earlier music.I still wish Marty's music will officially be released someday. I'll be over the moon when that happens, and I will give THAT a 5/5 most definitely!"
4,Days fans get this CD!,"I love the show, and this compact disc is a complement to my Days video collection (I record it everyday!) Overall it is a nice CD and I think if the producers of the show should make another one, they should include more theme music from the bad people of the show (Stefano, Evil Gina, Sami, etc.)Those are my most favorite themes. No matter what's on it, if you love Days you'll love this CD and I thought it was a good idea of Corday Productions to make it. I LOVE DAYS OF OUR LIVES NO MATTER WHAT!"
3,Nice to hear the old music in its entirety,"A must for all fans, contains all the great background music from Days.Produced around 1998 so remember that when considering."
5,great,"I am looking for the song Tonight I Celebrate My Love For You,the theme song played in Bo and Hope's wedding on Days Of Our Lives. Can you please help me? This is for my wedding Aug.28th. Thank You, Sheila White"
2,Days Gone By,Unless you're a new viewer of Days you won't enjoy the music. I was disappointed. Theme music from late 1997 and 1998. Enjoyed the opening and closing themes. I enjoy the love themes from 80's better. The picture of the cast on back is nice.
3,Informative but missing essential vocabulary,"The order and instruction are clear and easy to follow even without illustrations. However, I was disappointed that common words or synonyms for some basic vocabulary such as 'please', 'thank you', and 'sorry' and basic directions like 'left', 'right', 'straight' or cardinal directions,or other synonyms were not listed anywhere in the book. The illustrations were well portrayed. The book does cover the basics however some of the signs are combination words such as 'shawl' is making the sign for WOMAN and BLANKET other signs are interchangeable. For instance, the sign for 'wolf' is the same for spy, cunning, and Pawnee. Overall I consider this a good way to be introduced to the Native sign language."
4,Good book.,This is a good book for beginners. I'm using it to help as I reenact an Army Scout during the 1860s.
3,Interesting book,"I just wish that the photos came with more explanation of the movements that often accompany the sign to make it proper. Good little book to understand the language, though. I have found some better info on line, giving explicit movement directions, but not as many words and phases."
2,the indian pics are more intersting than the signs,"This book basically has some vocabulary for indian ""signs"". I am not sure if the real indians even use any of these signs. The old drawings were kind of neat and reminded me of an old schoolbook."
5,This movie helped me come out!,"I really enjoyed this movie, it gave me a new outlook on life. I never knew how it would be when I came out. It's great, I have found so many gay men that have showed intrest in me since I came out!! I would like to thank this movie for helping me make my decisiom to come out. This has been a great experience for me!.."
5,True Jazz,"Gary touches the soul with this CD. A real jazz lovers dream. You can feel his joy and pain. True Garu says it all. You can tell he ""must believe in music""."
3,SUPERB MARLENE !!!,"I found this movie very underrated. I discovered Marlene thanks to this movie (and BORZAGE's ""Desire""), and only after that, I saw the STERNBERG movies. For me, Marlene gave her finest performance thanks to LUBITSCH (and Billy WILDER's ""A foreign affair""). I found her very touching and sensitive in ""Angel"". Of course, the story seems ordinary, but under Lubitsch's fine direction, it is not boring at all. And remember, BUNUEL's classic ""Belle de jour"" (with Catherine DENEUVE) is a remake of LUBITSCH's ""Angel"" !!! 3 1/3 stars !"
2,Not One of Lubitsch's Best!,"It would seem that this movie had a sure recipe for a great movie: some talented actors including Marlene Dietrich with her incredible screen presence, a pinch of the famous Lubitsch touch... Unfortunately, the result is surprisingly bland and uninspiring. It's as if the actors and the director were involved in the project that did not interest them at all. There is not a spark of humor, wit, or enjoyment. Simply boring. This is the first Lubitsch's movie that I truly did not enjoy."
3,Marvin Dash - Model Turned Programmer,"Good deep house from Marvin Dash on his album MODEL TURNED PROGRAMMER. The title alone makes me curious what he looks like, though the smooth juiciness of ""Red Sparrow"" makes me think he's a German version of a player. ""Chocolate Weazel"" only confirms my suspicions. The disco-gloss of ""Rush Hour"" isn't as nice, though, and highlights the weakness of the album: that Dash has a tendency to overuse a single theme in his music. If it's a good one, there's no problem. But it's a weaker one, like the long ""Beat Treats""... This isn't a problem for ""Motorcycle Emptyness,"" which parlays its theme into a delicate deepness or for ""Friday Night with Burt Reynolds"" (though the latter is probably a bit too long). ""Looks Like We Are Coming Closer Tonite"" ends the album on a slower note (and a forced fade-out), though no less danceable. Nice, if not particularly noteworthy."
5,A STORY LINE THAT WILL TOUCH YOUR HEARTS,"The simplicity of this thought provoking novel brings back child hood memories that all baby boomers can share. Its charm and honesty warms your heart until you will want to give all your family members a hug. You'll want to love and forgive everyone, and know that you are worth what you know you really are and always have been, and that no one will ever be less that their true measure of love to you."
3,They can do much better than this...,"Anyone who thinks this is The Starting Line's best work has clearly not heard their older stuff. This album is definitely a step up from Based on a True Story, an album in which the band lost their musical perspective in an effort to progress their sound. That album had a few saving graces, but for them, not at all a great record. This album is a bit more reminiscent of their older work. Tracks such as Island and Direction touch on the dynamic melodies and rhythmic vocals that are classic TSL style. A few others, such as Are You Alone, or 21, or Birds come close, but not quite far enough.I've been a TSL fan for a long time now. I have no idea where Based on a True Story came from. But this album, in comparison to the last, was a much bigger step in the right direction. It's definitely worth a listen for the price - the tracks all come together to make for an interesting experience.Here's to hoping their next album beats them all."
2,The Boring Line,"I've never understood the reverie in which the Starting Line is held by some people. I remember a few years ago a friend of mine telling me ""Hey man, have you heard the Starting Line yet? They are absolutely amazing."" So I went and checked them out. I just couldn't see what all the fuss was about. Their music wasn't terrible or anything. It was just bland, cookie-cutter poppy punky emoish stuff that sounded like a million other bands.Regardless of my previous views of the band, I picked up 'Direction' on a whim a few weeks back and I am still just bored to death by these guys. The music isn't bad or annoying or anything but it is unbelievably boring. There's not a single hook on this record that sticks in my mind. Maybe there is just something I'm not getting because a lot of people really dig these guys, but for the life of me I just can't figure out what it is."
3,"""So-so"" CD","I've loved the Starting Line since I first saw them live and heard their ""With Hopes of Starting Over"" EP. Their high energy, melodic rock really caught me. I felt like the last CD was a step in the right direction, slightly matured, but still Starting Line...However, the new CD leaves a bit to be desired. I just feel like they went into the studio with a couple songs nailed down (Island being one of them), and then just made up a bunch of ""so-so"" filler. The best way I can put it is that it sounds like they wrote the CD in a month in the studio, which tends towards hollow songs with unimaginative lyrics. So while I don't hate it, I am disappointed."
3,"Not What I expected, but very strong!","I don't know where Starting Line went! I fell in love w/ this band with their first CD and was amazingly disappointed w/ their followup. This new release is extremely well put together in certain areas, w/ great lyrics and even catchier tunes. But the problem I felt w/ this album is that it did not bring back the original vibe The Starting Line came off with. I miss that vibe! Although juvenile and poppy at some points; Say it Like You Meant It had songs on it that will forever rest in the back of my mind. I can't really get the same feeling from this CD, a majority of the songs on here are forgettable. Regardless of this, I must applause how the band has progressed overall and how their sound has matured. Definitely better than their last CD, but no where near the superiority of their first. If you're a fan, pick it up for sure!~"
2,What happened to this band?,"I have been a fan of The Starting Line since their first album. I'm sorry to say that they have gone down hill since. Most of the songs on this album have awkward chord progressions and melodies that don't seem to fit. With a few exceptions (Island, I Could Be Wrong) this entire album just sucks :( I'm really dissappointed with the band. They used to write music that made sense... now its just a bunch of random chords with bad melodies."
1,Junk!,"Never made it through the first batch of paper. The tray will not pick up the paper, the ribbon tears and cannot be re used.Dust gets in and leaves marks on your print,Worst of all, it does not print from the computer anymore with system 7 or vista. This thing is a load of trouble and there are better ways to print photos.I took mine to electronic recycling after printing only ten pictures with it."
4,Black&Decker corded hand vac,"Great suction which you don't get from a cordless. Never have to worry about running out of power. 2 design shortcomings: 1. it does not come with any kind of mounting rack, so it has to sit on a shelf (I added some hardware so I could hang it on a wall hook) 2. it has a flap that flips up as a place to wrap the cord - a nice idea, but it could work much better if it was slightly curved.Overall, I got what I hoped - plenty of suction and never-ending power."
3,"Bad ""Collection Drum"" Design","The dirt collects inside both the main body & the door of the collection drum. In order to get the dirt out of the swing out door section of the drum, you have to lift a plastic flap that broke in less than a couple of months of use. Great vac, other than this one badly designed pc. of equipment."
4,THE BEST I HAVE SO FAR,"I bought a lot of hand held vacuum cleaners, so far it is the only one it really clean good. You have to see to believe how much dust & dirt I got from my master bathroom alone. Weightwise is ok, at least lighter than Shark. I really hate shark. It continues to change models and doen't make the replacement filter for my old one, therefore, I have to seek to buy a new one. I don't recommend Oreck, the cloth bag took the salesman more than 5 minutes to put it back during the demostration. I don't know the new model of Dirt Devil, anyway, I don't like the old one.The bad thing about this Black & Decker handheld vacuum is its longer nozzle. When you use the turbo brush, it becomes even longer and you have to hang your arm higher which makes your arm feel tired easier."
5,Master Rebel-Jake E. Lee,"I have this excellent Instrumental CD A Fine Pink Mist-by Jake E. Lee (formerly of Ozzy Osbourne and Badlands fame) and it's an Electric Sci-fi Rock/Blues sultry Masterpiece. Jake E. Lee mastery fingerworks enraptures you in from take off to landing on an journey quest that you'll surely will remember and want more of, great Music! The ""whole"" CD of ""A Fine Pink Mist"" has an Cinematic sultry Galactic feel to it as ""each-electric"" song unfolds it's story..-this is an wonderful Heavy enrapturing Instrumental Debut by Jake E. Lee and hope that the Rebel Legend will do ""more"" Instrumentals as well as ""finish"" the CD Projects with Mandy Lion (WWIII fame) in Wicked Alliance and also his side Project with Bourgeois Pigs Co-Partners Richard Black and Michael Guy."
5,The film that inspired me to write stories.,"Between 1989-1991, I'd been watching a great deal of motion pictures filmed between the 1927-1967 on late night television. In 1991, I saw ""The Children's Hour"" and was so impressed with the archetecture of the plot, the delivery of the lead actresses, subject matter and cinematography, I began to start writing. Ten years later, I've finally purchased the movie to watch it a second time. The impact this time much greater this time due to my own age. There is no way something like this could have produced in this day and age and is something of what I perceived to be a classic. The build up makes the end so powerful, it will leave those who cry over films with a wet face."
5,Great subject matter,The actors and surprising subject matter for the time. Hepburn is easy to look at and always like James Garnder
5,this is a must watch movie,I first saw this movie when I was 18 my bf and i rented the video tape and watched itI cried so hard and the end it is a very emotional movie all the actors are great and you just want to wring that girls neck.it is about a lie that had just a grain of truth to it.I was lucky enough to see the play when I was in San Fransisco.the ending is very sad but true in most cases of some who question their sexuality.
4,"Surprising, daring and ahead of its time","One of the most overlooked gems in Hepburn, MacLaine and director William Wyler's catalogs, this film starts like quite an ordinary by-the-numbers film from a girls school. Only when a lie from the mouth of a spoilt girl triggers a string of events that whirl out of control, the life will never be same again for any of the characters. The seemingly far-fetched plot from a play by Lillian Hellman gets frighteningly realistic under the sure hand of director William Wyler (Ben Hur, Funny Girl, Best Years of Our Lives). Audrey Hepburn gives an understated, graceful performance as one co-owner and teacher of the school, Shirley MacLaine is laconic and bitter as the other. The supporting cast is also excellent and although the film is far from easy viewing, it is nevertheless fascinating in its own very peculiar way - although the ending may seem to leave more questions open than solved."
3,"Whispers, murmurs and lies ....","ORIGINALLY released as ""The Loudest Whisper"" this one neatly counterpoints the 'hinted' relationships of ""The Haunting"" .... although this fairly timely warhorse by Lillian Hellman still works very well on stage.Originally filmed in the thirties with Mirian Hopkins ~ there was no hint of the lesbian implied romance, this one is somewhat bold for 1961 and provides excellent acting chops from both Miss Hepburn and Miss MacLaine - both performances are quite timeless - especially Maclaine's gradual and shatering breakdown - and the wordless conclusion between Miss Hepburn and fiancee .......Touching, sad and unforgettable...."
4,Audrey gives a remarkable perfomance,"This movie is true to the play which is delightful as well as rare. Both leading ladies give great performances. By today's standards, this movie is considered tame. This is a great movie for Audrey Hepburn fans to add to their collection."
5,tragedy of a lie,"This movie was well-written and acted. it was directed by William Wyler whose name is synonymous with great films. anyone who is an aficionado of classic cinema knows that. the movie intelligently depicts the tragic effects that one defaming unfounded lie can cause. i will not discuss the effects in detail due to the obvious reason that it would cheat anyone who hasn't seen this film. i will say do not expect an unrealistic outcome that some films have. once you've seen the film, you'll understand that last statement. the entire cast give stellar performances. very highly recommended."
5,Film way ahead of its time but GREAT,"Hepburn again proves she could act any character, from Holly Golightly to Eliza Doolittle to Karen. She was a beauty, and all class."
4,For MacLaine and Hepburn fans,"One must begin by understanding that this film premiered when hardly anyone used the word ""lesbian"" with any degree of comfort. The film does offer a vivid view of the horror that it must have meant to be thought of as ""bent"" in the 1950's. The whispers and the looks following comments from a young student who assumes an illicit affair between two female teachers, tell the whole story rather eloquently. Sterling performances by a very young Hepburn and and a very innocent MacLaine redeem a tortuous script where too much is left unsaid."
5,Children's hour,Great film. Misconceptions arise from a cultures naivete and lack of progressive understanding towards diversity. And innocent people are subjected to social intolerance. Historically culturally informative; a must see for the current generation.
2,"Stuffy presentation, ruined further by lousy ending","I was suprised how melodramatic and stilted the direction and presentation of the story was--by the ""great"" William Wyler. Cinematography is good and Hepburn is undoubtedly a ""movie star"", who's persona is so verrry grand. However the ending underminds whatever credibility had been built during the course of the film, and so the whole experience ends up being a downer. Worth seeing, but does not live up to it's potential. I also feel James Garner's involvement somehow trivializes the proceedings."
4,An Ok film,"Although this is an Audrey Hepburn film the over-riding theme is lying, but the underlying current is lesbianism. I didn't much care for that and definitely do not want my children watching this film EVER! Pretty much was not comfortable the whole show. Not recommended."
2,Overblown Drama From Ready-Fire-Aim Playwright Lillian Hellman,"This Audrey Hepburn/James Garner/Shirley MacLaine film based on a play by Lillian Hellman is a dark, dour, cynical, not very interesting movie about two women who are persecuted for being lesbians. The story does not ring true (even for the time it was written) as the ""evidence"" on which the women are convicted would have been debunked by even a rudimentary examination of the facts by a few mature, humane adults. The movie evokes feelings of creepiness, not sympathy as the playwright probably intended."
3,For the serious student of the writing process. Not me.,"I bought the set out of curiosity and, for one, was disappointed. It reminded me of writing college term papers a long time ago. Things underwent so many revisions that the finished product bore little resemblance to the original effort. I felt so labored at the end that I wanted only to hand the thing in and never see it again. Now, I truly enjoy The Lord of The Rings as it is but I am simply not interested in a history of all of Tolkien's efforts to write it. If I had understood what this set of books was, I probably would not have bought it. These are books for the scholar or the zealot; not for the average reader."
4,estee lauder purchase,"good price on the parfum, shiped faster than said, my wife realy likes this product,i don't think you will find a cheper price anywhere."
4,The King of the Kingdom of Awesome,Buy this album.Singable...and then you hear a lyric about dying astronauts and grandmas drinking mad dog.Wit. Sharp. Hot...and did I mention he's Jewish?
1,DONT BUY THIS DVD,"For the true tupac shakur fans, don't buy this dvd. this dvd doesn't have any live footage or music by tupac on the dvd. It also doesn't have any special features as well. there are no interveiws with close friends and family members. this dvd basically tells tupac's story using picutres that is lead by a narrator. this dvd was poorly mad. the pictures that they used in the dvd they reused them when tellig the story (cheap)over all don't buy this dvd. save your money and time."
1,Not Worth The Tears,"This DVD is literally an atrocity. There are no real words to describe how poorly made this ""documentary"" really is. I sold this DVD back without getting a full refund, proof of how desperate I was to get rid of it. This is an unauthorized DVD and and it was not completely factual. The commentary was horrible and they even showed Tupac's autopsy photo. I do not recommend this DVD.If you are looking for facts about Tupac, buy Thug Angel, Tupac vs, or the best of them all, Tupac resurrection."
3,what we expected,"The product is very heavy so I recommend having a 2nd set of hands to help you carry it and put it together. We are so glad we bought it though Amazon due to the free delivery. Other stores were selling it free ship to store"" and it would have been a nightmare to get home. We actually bought it to be a stage fo our little kids. the base will need some reinforcement but will otherwise make a good platform for their little theater. the top would normally be covered with a bed and im sure is moe attactive that way-- the particle board leaves a little to be desired."
3,The Axeman's Jazz,I live near New Orleans so it is fun to read about an area I am familar with. Skip is a trip. It was not a page turner for me
1,Pretty awful,"I don't know how this book was ever published. Two murders at the beginning of the story followed by a couple of hundred pages of inane dialog, limited action and uninteresting characters. I was not engaged by the story at all. I simply wanted to get to the end and be done with this awful book."
2,"If you axe me, it should have been axed....","The bulk of this book was filled with tedious details that added nothing of substance to the book. Decent potential, but apparantly there was not a moment of editorial oversight offered. The conclusion was as unsatisfying as everything that preceeded it. I have not read anything else in this series and am not inclined to do so now."
1,"Dull, uninspiring and shallow","This story was painfully boring. But I trudged through it because I figured it had to get better. I was wrong. From beginning to end, the plot is shallow, the characters boring and uninspired, the storyline so linear, and the dialog so completely unrealistic, that this book will probably disgust you for wasting your time to read it. I, for one, was glad when it was over."
4,This book is a good price performer. OK for novice.,"This book really tries to lay out what you are going to get into if you want to get into keeping, and possibly breeding, African Cichlids. Though it may leave some wanting more, at $5.56 (USD) it really packs alot of information and is a good summary of what you are in for with this intriguing hobby. Agreed, some of the information might be laid out a little more clearly. But it also presents a great deal more about all aspects of raising Africans that you don't get out of books costing $30, $50, even $100 (list price). I recommend it highly to a beginner. To one who has been involved in the hobby for a while, you may get more from rec.aquaria.freshwater.cichlids. But for the novice, I'd suggest you go for it before you decide to buy fish or a tank. It may help you avoid costly mistakes."
2,Disappointment,"This book is disappointing. It focuses too much on breeding cichlids, yet it claims to be a book for beginners. Beginners are not interested in breeding cichlids, they just want to keep their fish alive. The book is also very vague. For example, when discussing the proper PH level for Malawi cichlids it says keep it above 7. What does that mean, 7.5, 8.2 ?"
1,No One Can Play Country Fiddle,"Don't waste your money on this DVD. I am an experienced musican with guitar and mandolin background... I couldn't follow some of the lessons, which are, according to the DVD, for students with no experience.On numberous occasionns the music provided did not match what was being taught... confusing for me much less a beginner."
2,Painful to watch,"The instructor may be a very nice person, but she is incredibly uncomfortable being in front of the camera. It is difficult to watch her squirm and stall as she (obviously) reads off cue cards. And she doesn't play each tune through enough times to really play along with."
2,Where's the color?,"I used it once a day for a few days and was not noticing a change. I decided to double my applications. I used it twice a day for a week. Not a hint of color. No tan ever developed. It's good as a moisturizer and sunscreen, but not at all as a sunless tanner."
4,ORANGE,"Doesn't show up until the 3rd day and turns your face orange. Buy the Sublime BRONZE, not GLOW. It works fully in 3 days and gives a beautiful bronze, not orange."
2,Not much color,"I ordered this because a lot of the reviewers said it gave nice color. I also bought the Sublime Glow Daily Body Moisturizer for my arms and neck for the winter because I roller skate at the rink all winter, am at the gym a lot and wear sleeveless and camisole tops. Reviewers said they bought the face lotion so I thought maybe I should get it for the face as well. Now I am waiting to use it up so I can buy either Jergens or get the L'Oreal bronzer because I don't think this has much color. I use it every day too. Next time I won't bother with getting a separate lotion for my face. I 'll use the body lotion. I am disappointed. The smell doesn't bother me. I just want some color !"
4,like,"Great moisturizer, will say more when the product is completely used, good for winter use as well, may purchase another."
4,Fits Moto Q9h very well,"Fits nicely with or without extended battery. Fairly secure, requires two hands to tug phone out. Rotating belt clip a nice plus. Find I like it better than side-case type holsters, of which I have 2 (one Motorola-branded, which was horrible).Soft interior is nice and actually helps get some fingerprints off the finish.Secure so far despite slightly flimsy-seeming belt clip. For the dough this was a pretty good deal and its design will fit a lot of phones (it even holds my old Treo 680 pretty well!)"
2,It does not fit,"Very nicely made but .... it does not fit my 7250 Blackberry , my Berry is old but works well,again the case is nice but it is too tight , it pushs the buttons and I don't always have time to lock the keyboard"
2,nice if it didnt wear out so soon=(,"holds phone great! holds belt or other great! linkage between the clip and the holster? junk! im glad i bought it on amazon though, because if it were ebay i would have givin a great rating. i took about a month before it craped out soooooo do yourself a favor and spend a little more=)"
5,A very riviting and thought prevoking book,"There has been so much writen these last few years on this subject that it has become difficult to differentiate between that which is truth and that which is fantacy.Raymond E Fowler's latest works, both The Watchers and The Watchers11 sound like something out of a fairy tail. But this is far from fairy tails and goblins my dear readers. As I read this book something inside me knew this book and it's sequel may very well become the bible of all abduction and new age seekers of truth, and what is really out there. My mind still struggels with the content because it sounds so far fetched. Yet, how do we define truth? It is an inner knowing. My inner knowing was doing flips when I read this book even though still my mind rejects that which tends to shatter all that was taught to me as a child. Read it for your self. Just because it sounds too far fetched doesn't mean it isn't so"
5,A page turner!,"This book gives an an answer on who, what, where, why and when on these famous grey aliens."
2,You could do worse,"David Hasselhoff(Baywatch,KnightRider)and Linda Blair(The exorcist,hellnight)star in this average movie that really isn't that good. I would only recommend this movie if you're a fan of either Hasselhoff or Blair. If not stay away at all costs."
1,air filter,unfortunately the wrong air filter was in the box--after finding an A1236C air filter today--we found the difference--the old one in the box was not an A1236C--can't use it--rip off
3,Not Technical Enough,"If you are just beginning to learn Econometrics this book is good. However if you want a through introduction, with more math, look elsewhere."
1,Awful Verbose Book,"With its proud eschewing of math (the back of the book says ""'basic' means less math""), the book strains to explain concepts without sensible math notation. Simple ideas become long paragraphs because of this. It's almost as if Gujarati has turned the lectures he gives at the university at which he teaches into a book. Instead of being a resource of good example problems and concisely expressed formulas, we have a long book with too little content and too much talking to retain student interest. Perhaps less math oriented students would appreciate this book, but most students who choose to take intro-econometrics have some interest in economics itself, which, more often than not, requires more advanced study of econometrics, which, unlike this book, won't resist the math intrinsic to econometrics. Worse still is the organization of this book, which, given its emphasis on formulas, hasn't done a very good job of making the formulas easy to find.Not recommended."
1,Way too confusing,"This book may be understandable for a professor. But as a student, it is way too confusing for a person who is just learning econometrics to grasp. A student can get really lost in this book. Overall, it is not worth the money to purchase"
1,Copious amounts of excess vinyl glue,"Buyer beware Music 123 belittles A to Z claims. I received my brand new Dean EAB case with large amounts of excess vinyl glue outside and around all the seams. Everything sticks to it dirt, lint, your hands! what a huge mess! But the mess only gets dirtier when 123s contact seller link returns failed email contact notifications verified by Amazon. The leave feedback link works but if you reply to the reps email it also fails. What a stonewall setup. Good luck getting any service. I got a whole $14 back for my cleaning efforts. I figure way less than minimum wage and the cost of cleaning materials. What a rip off."
4,Great Archaeological Story,"Anyone interested in Archaeology will find Gibson's book a real treat, but religious historians may be disappointed in the depth of Gibson's knowledge of John the Baptist, Jesus, and 1st Century Israel. This book delves into every aspect of what makes archaeology so interesting and time-consuming, and there are lots of references to other archaeological sites and projects. You get a real flavor for what it must be like to go on a dig, and how much work goes into figuring out what you have. Even the many personal asides are enjoyable, for they give you a sense of going along with the author.As historical scholarship, however, Gibson's knowledge of the period appears to be limited to the archaeology. Students of theology and/or history can probably get more (and better) information elsewhere."
3,serious scent,"I stage homes for a living and this is the first time I have tried this product. The client had two old dogs, and even though the house showed very well, the dog smell when you entered the home was overwhelming, (to the point that buyers would walk in and not want to look through the house). I was hoping this product would be the answer, but the odor must have been so imbeded in the carpets that it was untreatable. I do know that enzymes are the best way to treat odors, but this time, this product did not work. I would still try it again on another home, just think this was an awful case."
2,Not Up To Par,"Does not meet the hype of its manufacturer. Works for a short while only, save your $."
1,Waste of Hard Earned Money,"Truly, keep your money. This product does absolutely NOTHING. My dog peed on the carpet. I bought this product for just such a moment. I has done NOTHING. Carpet still smells like dog pee after 3 applications. Very disappointed!!!"
5,Best Nut Shell,Best Indian law resource that you could ever want to get in the history of the world dude dude dude.
2,Tough going.,"I bought this book because I'd read Barbara Ehrenreich's ""Nickel and Dimed"". I found N 'n D very good, so wanted to expand my horizons to other experiences - Barbara Ehrenreich had tried low-paid jobs, in many fields, and 'Toyland' promised something similar.Hard work for us readers!I thought I'd be learning about the working conditions in American toy stores but instead learned all about genderized toys, emphasized feminity and cultural legitimation.The prose is a parody of socio-speak and what I took to be present obsessions in gender studies; everything has to be examined from the point of view of gender. The African-American perspective on interaction rules is examined, many times. Previous studies and articles are quoted extensively. All of this is done repeatedly.The points made may be good, but the prose soon drains the reader's away. I finished the book, but would have happily settled for half the length, and a version culled of its socio-speak.Stick to Barbara Ehrenreich."
4,Great relaxing reading,"Lee Smith once again writes about mountain people and their ways of life. She chronologically takes the reader from the early musical interests of a family who become sensations in Music City. The story is heart-warming, real, and quirky rolled into one. A definite must-read"
3,Pretty Good,"The book was hard to read and get into at first because it written in an Appalachian vernacular and the narrator changes. However, the book itself is pretty good, and I think reading it again would let me have a much better appreciation for it."
1,Not what the boys wanted,"This was what my husband and son wanted but they never got to play it because it didn't work with the xbox360. If they wanted it to work, we would have to buy a $100 part. Just check your game system with the requirements so you get something compatible!"
2,"1/2 likable entertainment; 1/2 stupid & sadistic,","The 1st match (Jungle Woman & Spanish Red vs. the Cheerleaders) was funny, silly, acrobatic, athletic, sexy, and glamourous.The 2nd and 3rd matches (Dementia vs. Little Egypt; Dallas vs. Ninotchka) were stupid, shameful, and sadistic.The fourth match (Soul Patrol, Hollywood, and Vine vs. Tina Ferrari, Ashley Cartier, California Doll and Sally) was glamourous but the wrestling lacked acrobatic skill, and the lights go out for the second half of the match making it hard to see.1st match and early comedy skits: ***** 5 stars2nd & 3rd matches: _ 0 stars4th match: *** 3 starsTape Average: ** 2 stars"
1,Too small,"These are the smallest water glasses I have ever seen. Should have read the last review, he was right!"
2,False advertising!! The shams aren't shams.,"Please be aware that the ""shams"" they actually mail to you are not the ones pictured here. I have included a picture of the actual pillow cases in the image section. It's just a regular pillow case, no border, no button closure. Also, the color is more of a gold than a brown."
2,Buyer Beware - Great Product But Missing Shams,"Great duvet cover for the money - but this is ONLY the cover, the shams are not included as promised."
1,"Duvet Only, not a set","I received my order promptly. The fabric was above average for the price. I did not receive the shams. After receiving 2 incomplete orders and a time span of 2 months, still no shams, I decided the Duvet was not worth it."
4,Great cover for the price,"I like the Duvet. Luckily I wasn't too interested in the shams since I did not receive any. If that is a requirement for you, you better skip this product as it seems to be a roll of the dice as to whether you get them or not.The color is just what I wanted, although I don't think I would have called it ""ruby""... it's a bit more burgundy/maroon. It's very deep and pretty though. 100% cotton. Fairly lightweight. I washed it and threw it in the dryer before using it and the color didn't bleed hardly at all. Nor did it seem to shrink much, if any. Overall a very nice cover for the price."
5,"Fast Focus, Very Sharp Lens","I've had this lens about two weeks, using it on a Canon 30D. It seems to be very sharp at all focal lengths and f-stops. Focus is very fast with Sigma's HSM (Hyper Sonic Focus Motor). It's for APS-C sensor digital cameras only, which enables it to be shorter, but once sensors are all full-frame you'll be sorry you got a DC series lens. The Sigma 70-200 f2.8 is full-frame, but more expensive and much longer.I bought the Sigma 1.4x Converter, which turns this lens into a 70-210mm f4. It works, but resolution is slightly diminished. The difference was noticable.I'd say get this, and its sharpness and size will have you keeping it on the camera as your main lens. It will vignette on 35mm and full-frame digital sensors, so make sure you plan to stick with Canon's APS-C line."
4,Good book if you want quick info and know Java already,"I needed to do some work in Javascript that required a moderate skill level. I already know ""real"" Java as well as HTML and didn't want to get a 500+ page manual detailing every single aspect of Javascript...I simply don't need that level of knowledge for what I'm doing. I've been working with Java for just over five years, and programming for just over twenty years. If you're like me and simply need to solutions quickly and you are an experienced programmer, this book is quite good. I was able to extract the information I needed in just a few hours. On the other hand, if you're a complete novice to programming or Java is foreign to you, you might want to look at books that are a little less aggressive in their approach. It would be nice if they added an appendix of the Javascript classes and methods used, but for as little as this book costs, I can't complain."
2,This is a begining/intermidate level book,"The problem with this book is that it is different from the regular series of the visual books.If you know javascipt like I do, this book makes sense. However, if you are new to javascript don't buy this. The explanations are terrible.There are woking examples. The example are the best features of the books because of the simple coding."
4,good book,"The book lives up its name. The book is not for beginners, it does not explain javascript syntax. The book shows, however, practical jscript implementation. I am a vbscript programmer and I needed an ultra quick tutorial in Javascript (something like jscript in 20 minutes). The JScript5.5 documentation from Microsoft is only good for syntax reference. This book showed me exactly how to take the syntax into my html pages in a short, efficient way.An affordable desktop reference."
2,Not Good,"Complicated Explainations. If you are new to javascript , this bookwill give you a headache.If you have experience this books is ok"
5,THE ROBOTZ CONSTRUCTION TEAM!,"My 2 1/2 year old really loved this set as his first real action figures. The figures are electronic and hooked together. Separately they each have sounds and voice but when connected together Jackhammer and C-ment1 actually communicate with each other as they tear up the roads and pave new ones. Kids love it because they can easily push the various buttons to hear the sounds. all the figures in th Rescue Heroes line are very durable and stand up well to the kind of abuse a pre-preschooler can dish out. Add to that the nice wide feet of the figures allow younger kids to stand them up quite easily as compared to normal action figures.These are really fun, reliable and wonderful toys for young children. All of the figures have good storylines behind them. No small parts to worry about being swallowed. Good stuff!"
3,Vancouver from the inside,"This is not a story by D. Coupland but rather short anecdotes about his hometown Vancouver. I found this book very ""canadian"": he describes a city and its culture that has changed a lot with the past decades. A must read if you are like me an afficionado of Douglas."
5,Swordbird,I bought this book for a class. The reports I got back is that the students really liked it. They seem to appreciate books out of the ordinary.
4,Wow.,"I am really impressed. If someone hadn't told me that this book was written by someone my age, I never would have guessed. Although the story lost me at times, I found this to be a wonderfully written book. It was inspiring to me, being a writer, to see such talent in this young author. The battle between good birds and bad birds was very intriuging and I reccomend it to everybird."
3,"Percy Potter, 9 year old book worm",It is better than Guardians of Ga'Hoole because the deaths in Guardians of Ga'Hoole were very gory. I didn't like this book because everything happened too fast. I like book where the plot takes longer. I would recommend this book to third graders who like fantasy books with out a lot of fighting or violence.
3,A cute book for young fantasy readers,"I purchased this book because I was curious to read this story written by a very young author. The storyline does weave a simple tale of a world of birds, but the plot is not as complex as promoted. The book is definitely for a younger audience, but older readers may find it enjoyable too. Also, the illustrations are very detailed, but I was disappointed that they were repeated so often in the book."
2,Swordbird,"After my friend told me about this book (we're both the author's age), I was very excited to find a book that was written by someone who understands what the age group is like. Boy, were we in for a disappointment.People all say ""oh, this is a wonderful book for children!"" but all the inaccuracies and predictable plotlines got annoying. It also didn't help that the book was like a spin-off from the Redwall series. Sorry, but the only good thing in it were the illustrations. Maybe there is a reason why most authors are adults."
1,Not worth reading unless your under twelve.,"I'll try to be breif, because all in all, I did not like this book.Throughout the book I continually lost focus because it was an overall dull book. In fact, I quickly found that I couldn't care less about the outcome of the book by the time I reached the end of chapter one. This, however, I could make myself overcome and so I finished it. But then I reached the end, if you could call it that. I was definately dissappointed. The story just stopped. Throughout the entire book there was what I figure was meant to be a complex fight between good and evil, but then suddenly, evil was defeated and the story ended.I just find that after finishing the book, I wish I hadn't wasted the time."
1,Annoying.,"Swordbird actually turned out to be somewhat of an annoyance to read. The plot was weak, the dialouge boring, and the setting very non-descript. Anyone who considers this a good book should probably read more. Swordbird is a sad excuse for a novel, and makes me ashamed to call myself an author. Don't waste your money on the half-baked characters and dry jokes that are contained within the pages Nancy Yi Fan penned. I will give her credit for her age, but that is not a valid excuse."
2,Watered down Jacques,"I read a few pages and thought that the story was much in the mode of the Redwall series, but written in quite a mediocore manner. The richness of Jacques's descriptions, his humorous characters and wickedly evil villains made reading his books enjoyable. There is little of that in this book. I found the characters to be rather contrived, the plot poorly developed and I could not finish the book. Perhaps the author will improve with age and maturity."
2,Shocked by the unnecessary gorrie violence,"The story was fine until the unexpected gorrie, graphically depicted violence. Violence is pretty easy to convey - for kids this age you don't need to go into the call of duty type graphics."
4,great book for young kids ages 8-12,I just finished this book for a book report at my school.I've read lots of books by young authors but never have they ever come close to Sword Bird. Nancy Yi Fan did a great job for her first book. I was atracted by the cover I mean who would think of making a book for fighting birds.The world needs to read this book because now we need peace.
3,A pleasing book to read to young children who hunger for a longer story.,"The attractive cover art draws one into this book, and upon reading the surplus material, it is surprising to learn the author is twelve years old, and, this, her first book, was contracted with a major publisher! A choppy and confusing beginning levels out quickly, due to a cliched storyline: goodbirds versus evilbirds and a white saviorbird from the sky. The composition is charming; it's well-written, although childishly so. The birds have entertaining names (Aska, Parrale, Slime-beak, Skylion, Reymarsh), and descriptors are fun, too (everybird, nobird, slavebird, tipclawing). It's enjoyable to imagine a birdworld, but there's not enough fluff and stuff to hold the attention of independent readers over age ten.The illustrations depicting the birds are incredible, especially The Flying Willowleaf Theater in their hot air balloon."
2,"Good writer (for her age), but not great","I read this book a while ago when it first came out (so, I was in 7th grade) and I had a hard hit of dejavu. I've read this before. It's basically Redwall, but watered-down.It's very common for young authors to ""rip off"" stories rather than be ""inspired"" by them/make it their own. Another example is Eragon...She's talented for her age (she's definitely better than me when I was thirteen) but, if this hadn't been written by a young author, it likely wouldn't have been published. The style was awkward. The characters were stiff. Their dialogue was unconvincing.She will certainly improve with this experience, though (and I believe she's written another in the meantime). I know it :) I'll be looking out for any other books by her."
4,Anything the gets my daughter to read is AWESOME!,My daughter is a very bright child but she rarely finds things shes wants to read.This is a book she has checked out from our library almost every time we go.These last few times she's kept it soooooo long we've had to pay late fees.I'll be ordering her her own copy as well as the second book and the third when it is released in paperback.As an author myself I love that Nancy took a chance and put these stories out. It took me ten years to get the nerve to do it and then I did under a pen name.As for the person who posted a review say its a great story if your under twelve...maybe you should check out the authors page...
2,what a ripoff of multiple series,"this book is a ripoff of multiple series, mainly kathryn lasky's guardians of ga'hoole, (wich i loved) erin hunter's warriors series, and brian jaquess' redwall series. if you are a fan of any of these, i advise you not to read this book."
2,Trite and annoying,"I was really disappointed with this boring and badly written book. The self pity, that he tries, but fails, to hide, really gets on your nerves. Sure to appeal to disillusioned 15-year olds. Wise up! Try Celine for some intelligent pessimism."
1,Enough already...,"Chosen by my book group, so I stuck with it, and honestly hoped it would get better, only to be disappointed. I have to say I really can't belive how many people give this book such high ratings. I thought it was tedious, pointless, and uninspired. I found a certain bits of it mildly interesting (very few and far between), but mostly I felt like I was being beaten over the head with the descriptions of his ineptitude, and mocked for being a productive member of society. So the guy's a drunk who can't keep a job. I got that before I was a quarter of the way through. Why should I continue to care for that many pages?"
3,it ends where it begins,"Factotum by Charles Bukowski is about Henry Chinaski who travels through the U.S. accompanied by alcohol, sex and dead-end jobs. Chinaski is an alcoholic who has no goals in life and therefore has a state of mind that can be simply described as a sad carelessness or just indifference. Chinaski loses his jobs because he drinks or does not take any responsibility. He also drifts from one relationship into another but fails to manage to maintain a stabile one due to his egoism and lack of responsibility. This non-developing way of life is well pictured by Bukowskis simple, realistic and true style of writing but it failed to grip me and would not evoke the desire to read it again.The plot is too monotonous, there is no development in the story and one could start reading right in the middle of the book and would not miss anything important. The book ends where it starts."
5,down and out,Charles Bukowski served as an inspiration when I was a existentialist teenager. His searing wit and semi-autobiographical style endears any reader to his cause. For those spoiled surburan yuppies this book will serve as a eye opener to how many people survive. This book will remain in my memory for many years to come. I find myself frequently referring to it at time and its familiarity always brings a measure of comfort in those dark and dreary days.
4,A fine read,"This was another fine read from Bukowski. I have read all his novels and this one ranks up ther with Post Office. Sometimes the the stories focus on the dirty in life can bring a reader down, but his simple and straightforward language makes it easier to get through.Taxi Cab Carroll"
5,great author and an unexpected pleasure to read,This is a new author for me and I was not sure what to expect. I am I discovered it and look forward to read all of his books.
3,Reads like Burroughs.,"I gave this book three stars, because it's fun and an easy read. I was able to knock it out in two sittings. I see a lot of reviewers commenting highly on Bukowski's prose, saying it's poetic and smooth, elementary is a better description. His prose reminds me of Kerouac and William S. Burroughs.The novel centers on Hank Chinaski, and his inability or lack of desire to stay employed. He basically is an alcoholic, womanizer who's living paycheck to paycheck. It's a fun read, a beach read, but if your looking for character depth and a plot, you won't find it here."
4,Factotum,"Bukowski has great images of the downtrodden and the lowlife but he offers little in the way of anecdotes for inhumanity except maybe drinking and bumming. After awhile one gets the feeling that being a victim is his excuse for affirming authenticity. Of course writing for him is a salvation though after awhile all these biographies of the down and out read the same. He gives some great graphic depictions of alcoholism but to me this doesn't equate with greatness in and of itself. I would add that full blown alcoholism is much worse for suffering than bukowski depicts. It is not some bohemian romance to see the end result of dependence as i do in healthcare. However, I think bukowski conveys quite chillingly the inhumanity that helps drive people to it."
2,Repetitive,"""Factotum"" is a story that goes nowhere but around and around.It's the same thing: Henry gets a job, gets a chick, tons of drinking and getting drunk,loses or quits the job, is poor, gets another job, a new chick, more drinking, loses or quits the job....etc....""Ham on Rye"" and ""Post Office"" were much better."
1,NOT HAPPY,I THOUGHT THE DOG HOUSES WERE JUNK AS THE ZELCRO DIDNOT HOLD THE PRODUCT TOGETHER .NOT HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT FOER THE COST.NICK PARIS
2,wrong track listing,"For any potential purchasers of this set, the track listing for 2 tracks is incorrect. Track 30 is actually My Girl by the Whispers and 36 Hell of a fix by Marion Jarvis. The order of tracks 19-36 is wrong. Apart from that this is quite a nice little set."
3,Why no radio play west of San Antonio,"I live in Phoenix, AZ and heard the CD while traveling to Houston in April of 2001. But the Phoenix radio only maily Snoop and Nate Dogg. What gives. Did anybody find the lyrics to Power up? Is so, will you share the location."
5,"Come on baby, buy this CD","If you know what song you the title of this message came from, then buy this CD. 'nuff said."
2,There are better books around on coaching,"If you think on starting to coach co-workers, family, friends, team, thumb around and look for another book. The authors start mentioning you can read the book from cover to cover (what I did). I would recommend reading it upside down.Writing is not clear enough, and, unless you are an experienced and enthusiastic coach, nothing will make sense for you.On their defense I have to say the version I read was translated into Portuguese and some of the essence may have been lost in the process."
1,not for those that aren't looking to coach others,"I give this book a one star because it wasn't an easy read and Iam certain I would have taken to the info much better had I taken several classes regarding the subject first. I wasn't looking to coach anyone really but my self but felt overwhelmed with all the graphs and coach lingo, reminds me of possibly a sales men or a foot ball coach."
3,CD Glitch,"I enjoyed listening to the two CD set of some of Luciano Pavaratti's best loved songs. Unfortunately on disc one there is a defect on cut 5 at 46 seconds whch causes the player to go back to 25 seconds and play until it gets to 46 seceonds after which it continues this vicious circle. I was sent a replacement disc where the identical problem occurs. The problem can be duplicated on any number of CD players.I hope the manufacturer resolves this problem. Luciano, I love your voice but not the same 21 seconds over and over. Ciao!"
5,Brings me to tears,"I never got a chance o ee him in a concert. But I do have this - it's not the same, but it is something."
1,This is the worst coffee-table book on architecture,"Incongruos selection of works, grouped between two badly designed covers, with the obvious intention of just selling it to people with no other interest in architecture than to have a book to place in their living rooms. Zellner's writing is of poor style and denotes lack of knowledge and research."
1,"Bad design, worse write.",Is incredible this book receive a good critique. The text is badly write and the grafic design too bad for a architecture book. The reader who review it as good must be himself Zellner under a faked identity.
1,One to be missed,Destined to be a fixture in many bargain used bookshops or the coffee tables of people who should no better.
4,Great Bag for Dean ML Guitars,"Just rceived this bag. It is really well constructed of a soft imitation leather. Bag is large enough to hold a Dean ML pefectly. Comes with a nice carrying strap and should protect your guitar in transit. I was lucky and got mine on sale for $32, but bag is worth the reg price."
5,Christmas story . . .,"Set during Christmas time in Buenos Aires, this enjoyable film follows a number of characters both Jewish and Christian who are dealing with the unsettling circumstances of their lives. A financial crisis in Asia puts a bank employee out of work; the death of a mother leaves a young man in emotional limbo; a video filmmaker can't seem to strike a balance that suits her lover; a train station restroom attendant waits for her husband to be released from prison; a young woman waits for the young man she loves to take an interest in her; people's expectations are thwarted and unfulfilled. Meanwhile, life waits for no one and hurries on at a frenetic pace. There are bar mitzvahs and weddings, funerals, holidays, job interviews, karaoke, purse snatching, sexual encounters, and discussions about circumcision. Edited with frequent jump cuts, the film captures the unsettled circumstances of its characters, and the performances are just fine."
1,give me reality.,"I guess its not easy or possible to move reality into movie and this flick is not exception. My collection stretch into thousands of titles and most of them plain junk, some pretending be an art, some pretending to have a message, and some just wasting my time.This flick wasted my time and money. Sure,movie create some kind of reality if you wanna believe in it but this is not the case. Showing flow of life is not art if you carefully avoid facts you consider not appropriate for audience, you plainly consider audience stupid. One star."
2,Weightless,"I usually enjoy a movie that begins with bad news of an apocalyptic nature. That, and I'm a sucker for green skies. Otherwise, I liked almost everything in this sci-fi flick but the `Afterschool Special' problems with the teens. I suppose they thought it would humanize the situation by including a REAL family with REAL problems.....meanwhile; the world is going up the big drain in the sky. I don't think petty little problems with smelly cars and ex-boyfriends rise to the same level as THE WORLD COMING TO AN END! This part of the movie didn't hold my interest for one minute. Instead, I found myself lost to the hope that they would just drop that part of the story and carry on with the matter at hand....saving the world. Sad to say they didn't. Had I known beforehand that so much time was going to be wasted on the teen angst aspect; I would have never bought this DVD."
3,QUITE A LEAP,"What can one say about a movie that has an autistic 30ish man as its hero? Or a retro punk girl as a brilliant physicist?Unfortunately, QUANTUM APOCALYPSE is just another disaster flick with incohesive science and amateurish fx. Ironically, I found myself mildly entertained and amused.Rhett Giles as the savant gives a game performance while lesser known actors aren't overly offensive. Certainly not the worst disaster flick but not one of the best either."
3,Not bad.,"The two specialists were a little annoying, but I really liked the character of the ""special"" man who saves the day! I'm glad I watched it...but not good enough to watch a second time."
2,What just happened?,"I was half way through the movie, needed to make dinner, walked away for a minute, and suddenly the movie was over without a real explanation of the ending!? Wow, feel cheated."
3,first B+ movie,"Must say was pleasantly surprised, good story, a few unanswered questions. (spoiler alert) I do think that the uncle had gone through it 600x because of the pancake comment in the first scene and last. First time I have enjoyed a B rated movie, with a little better fx (only one or two that were kinda ehh) and a few big names, this couldve been another Independence day hit."
3,Book o.k. if you're curious about Fistandantilus,"This book was rather slow at first, then midway through it got pretty interesting. It has little to do with Raistlin, I guess Niles was trying to explain how Fistandantilus made his way to the future as a spirit, the spirit that eventually turns Raistlin into what he is in the Chronicles Trilogy. Though the book was at times hard to follow, it explained well how Fistandantilus crossed the barriers of time, but it fell short of explaining how Fistandantilus wound up in the Tower of High Sorcery at Wayreth as some sort of spirit.I recommend this book if you're a DL fan and want to know more about Fistandantilus."
2,Not exactly what I was hoping for...,"Fistandantilus. One of the most powerful Black Robes in the history of Krynn. The true Master of the Past and the Present. I thought when I bought this book it would have alot of action, centering around him. Well I was wrong. This story is centering around his attempts to be reborn, and chronciles others' lives in the process. If you are looking for a story featuring a powerful wizard, look elsewhere, or maybe the last chapter or so. *shrug*"
5,Niles's best!,"FR is my favorite DL book of all time. Why? Well, several reasons really. For starters, the book's setup is intriguing, with jaunts back and forth in time as Foryth Teel, who, up until the end, was the omnipotent narrator uncovers more information about the mysterious Fistandantilus and his dual-lives.Secopd, the book explained a great many things about Fist, whose whereabout up until this book were a complete mystery. As well, it reveals the origins of Foryth Teel (whom Niles has used in past short stories about little-known historical events) and how a kender got to Forgotten Realms... heh.My only gripe: it didn't give us the part about the Heroes of the Lance's jaunt through Skullcap, an event noever novelized. In all, the book is enganging and very well-executed. It makes me think that perhaps Niles gave it his all here and that was why The Last Thane was awful."
2,I hated this book!,"IN SHORT: The book has a winding confusing storyline, that goes nowhere, the actual story really doesn't start until page 200. It has pages of pointless stuff that goes nowhere really such as that mage Kite. The only good thing is that the last hundred pages were pretty good."
3,No Mage story!,"the story of Fistandantilus after the explosion at Skullcap. The book has a brilliant plot and is the best reason to reading it. But however, Fistandantilus isn't in it that much and this is mostly a story about a (surprisingly gloomy) kender, desperat boy, a human lad, and a very naive historian. It is a good story however, and If you are a fan of Fistandantilus i sugest you read it to clear up things."
3,Yep. It's a book.,"Okay, let me say this about Fistan...Fistu...god, you can't even pronounce the stinkin' name. Okay, Fistandantilus Reborn was a relatively okay book. The story really didn't begin until around page 200 something, but afterwards, it got pretty good. It had a good ending, but I've read better."
1,THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Damn Douglas Niles! Always ruining a perfect world. He already ruined Forgotten Realms, and now he's polluting my favorite world - Dragonlance!!! I had it up to here with his work - they suck!!! First of all why the hell does he send his essence in a KENDER, and a bloodstone?? Second, the damn book rarely even talks about him!!!! ( always the damn kender sheeesh) If you want a GOOD Fistandantilus book, then get ""War of the Twins"", not this foul junk! Douglas, you really suck at writing, so please do us all a favor? STOP WRITING!!!!!"
2,"Fistandantilus Reborn (Lost Legends Series , No 2).","I have read a lot of the Dragon Lance books, and and I have been very pleased with them all. And therefore I looked forward to read about Fistandantilus. But the book really isn't much about Fistandantlus, it is sadly more about a kid, whose parents got killed by a dragon, and now seeks revenge. There are only some small passages about Fistandantilus. And I had hoped that the book, might sheed some light over one, of the most evil and powerfull beings in the history of Kryn. But the book sayes nothing about how Fistandantilus was before his ""body"" died."
5,The Best I've Seen,"The great thing about these flashcards is that they have only one fact per card. The front side has the problem, and the back side has that problem with the answer. This makes a very clear connection between the problem and the answer. Most other sets of cards have two facts on each card, with the problem on one side and the answer printed in small type in the upper corner of the back.The cards are sturdy. They have that rounded corner which helps get the cards all facing the same direction. They include every fact from 0-12."
3,"Nice quality, but...","The cards are made well, but they did not have all the combinations of numbers that I was expecting. For instance, if they had 5 + 8, they did not have 8 + 5, which often is very different to a child."
3,Rosary,"The art of the Vatican is very interesting, but the second DVD is misleadingly titled Rosary. It is not a rosary, but only series of images of clay figurines and descriptions of the 20 mysteries of the Rosary. Prayers are jumbled together and are incomplete. Very disappointing when expecting a recitation of the most Holy Rosary."
4,Wonders of the Vatican Library: The Rosary,Very good informative voice over and pictures of the rosary. A wonderful DVD for parents to watch with their children and to discuss the life of Christ and the prayers of the Rosary.
2,Disapointing... but completes the collection.,"If you can get both DVDs together for cheaper, do it. But this 2nd dvd has too little extra footage to be worth the money. Instead, get the OST. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely LOVE One Six Right and I'm watching parts of it every couple of days. But this was simply disappointing because I had already seen all the air-to-air footage. Brian telling me how they had a hard time shooting the movie just wasn't as thrilling..."
4,flying,this is a really fun collection of out-takes and interviews that didn't make it into 1-6 right.
5,Absolutely Amazing Film,"Simply put, the Finest General Aviation film out there. If you are into aviation, it will put tears in your eyes. Buy this video, then give it to non-flying friends (or politicians!) to show them what flying means to our nation. A moving experience."
4,Excellent and exciting video for flight enthusiasts,This video contains sublimes images about flying. It gives you a good idea of the world of aviation made by enthusiast guys. The landscapes are magic and captivating. Would be better in Blu-Ray Disk in full HD.
5,Casey McNeal has says it straight!,"I recently attended a seminar where Casey McNeal (author) was the featured speaker. He explained the concepts of this book so well I had to own it.There will be an audio version coming out in the first part of November called Building Relationships; How to Work With People, also by Casey McNealHe had me pegged! If you want to understand how to better interact with your spouse, lifepartner, coworker, teenager, or boss, you need this book! Casey tells it like it is!"
5,Code Lyoko XANA Unleashed v.1,Great transaction. Exactly what my 11 year old grandson had been waiting to receive as a gift. He was thrilled!
4,"A wonderful show, but handled badly.","Don't get me wrong, Code Lyoko is a really cool show, which is why I picked up this volume, as well as the second, and plan to get the third. But what I don't understand is why they aren't releasing the episodes in their proper order - Volume 1, for example, has, respectively, episodes 21, 5, 3, and 16, with episode 1 thrown in merely as a bonus. The show is largely episodic, true, but there is also an overarching plot throughout the season, which can't hope to be understood if the episodes are viewed out of sequence."
1,"Code Lyoko... Bad, bad, bad",This has got to be the crappiest show I have ever seen.Down with Anime. Down with poorly drawn characters. Down with crappy shows.BAN THIS SHOW FROM EXISTENCE!
1,This bites!!!!!!,"This has the worst dubbing I have ever seen in my entire life!!!! When I saw commecial for it on cartoon network I didn't know it was dubbed, but I had only seen less than five minutes of it and I knew it was dubbed by how terrible it was!!!!! So if you don't care about horrible dubbing watch this. And if this wasn't in Japanese first, then I sincerely apologize. America has gone to the dogs if this was here first and we did this horrible of job."
2,Franklin Merriam Webster Dictionary SCD-1870A,"My comments on this products are as follows.1. Words on the screen are too small to read.2. Voice is too low and not clear.3. Letter keys are too small to push not even comparable to your Spanish-English dictionary BES-1890.Over all, this dictionary has an attractive appearance but it's impractical to use. I don't think it's a good product."
3,Franklin BES-1890 dark screen,"First, the item works so that's good. The screen though is hard to see. Have to get it in good lighting to read.Can't translate sentences which would be nice.I like the hangman game for learning words.I wouldn't purchase this item again now that I have actually used it."
5,Good!!,I loved it. Very educational and didactic. I recommend it! It was exactly as described and in a rugged package.
4,Pleased with Franklin Speaking Spanish-English Dictionary,The Franklin Speaking Spanish-English Dictionary that I purchased is a great product. I have recommended that co-workers purchase the item.
5,Excellent product,"Despite several bad reviews, I purchased this product after losing my Franklin BES-1850. I started using Franklin English-Spanish dictionaries over ten years ago and they have proved to be very beneficial in learning Spanish. This one is no exception. Some reviews said the sound wasn't loud enough; mine is perfect. One complained about the screen being too small; mine is more than adequate. Some complained about it not having a backlight; although it is convenient, it is not necessary. I would tell anyone who is considering buying this to go ahead and buy it. You won't regret it."
1,Defectuoso,"De este producto no puedo opinar ya que llegó en mal estado, es decir no funcionaba. No reclamé a la tienda ya que en verdad no sé donde lo dañaron."
1,What a dud,"I just got it. It is quite poor.First, the speaking part: It is so quiet as to be useless except when using the extraordinarily uncomfortable ear piece.Next, the screen.The letters are so small, that even with reading glasses it is almost unreadable.The display:Poor contrast regardless of the setting.Phrases:You can only get pre-programmed phrases after going down rather long selection trees. Good luck using that.I wish I could give this thing zero stars, or negative, because it is of no practical use.Buy ANYTHING else, but stay away from Franklin. I'm a slow learner, since over the years I have bought several of their tools and have hated them all.R44chopper"
1,short life span,I liked this unit so after 1 year when the first on I bought quit working I bought another one. well a year later!!!!!!!! guess what!!!!!
4,Franklin BES-1890 Spanish=English Dictionary,I am very satisfied with the translator. I used my previous Franklin for so many years that the numbers and letters were worn off the keys. The translating function is the only feature I use and I'm very content.
2,Very Difficult to Read,"This ""dictionary"" has a screen that is almost completely illegible. Too much info. is displayed in too small an area and in a (non-backlit) format. Keys are alos not well marked. It is also ""factory packaged"" in a hard plastic sheel that one has to break into in order to try out the device. Some sellers will not accept returns if the package is opened. Sort of a ""Catch 22."" I had hoped that this (and other) Franklins would be better designed and user-tested. Pretty sad."
3,Not what I needed,This product has several features but not the one I was hoping for. I had wanted to type in my own sentence and have it translated instead of having to choose from the ones it has in it's system. I misunderstood what it was capable of doing.
3,Great but sound is too low to matter.,Great translator with great features but the sound is so low it is useless. I still love it. Also really wish it was backlit.
5,Awesome,"I am always learning so much from this. The low lighting and sound quality doesn't bother me. It serves it's purpose and it's a great product for the price. I do wish that it could translate phrases too, but it only does one word at a time."
1,Set it back,This product did not say the word that was translated. It would only say the original word. It does not translate phrases only a single. Sent it back
5,Great Book,"Enjoyable Reading, Very edge of your seat , Great stories by imaginative writers, hope they make it into a movie"
1,Dragged into Darkness,"I could not continue reading this book after the first chapter. It was not at all what I thought it would be and I lost interest almost immediately. From the cover I thought I would like it but it said nothing about vampires, etc. and skipped at first anyway from one thought to another. I would probably not buy or read another one of his books as I felt the writeup on this was very misleading."
1,Terrible,Absolutely awful. Short stories of dire writing which stinks of the author 'not bothering' to really work his mind. Trashed it when half way through because I really couldn't read anymore! Not recommended even if it was free!
3,Creepy Critter,I don't know what makes Simon Wood tick...and I like horror movies and creepy stuff...but this guyis something else. But then..maybe I am just too old for I know the younger set goes for this kind of horror as evidenced by movies of the last decade or so. So for me...too creepy...but if you like creepy.. I mean really creepy..this is your book!!
1,Not what I was hoping for.,"I enjoy the office of compline and was looking for something to shake up the routine from the compline I normally use from the Book of Common Prayer; however, upon receiving this book I find I cannot use it. The prayers are a bit too unorthodox for my Anglo-Catholic tastes and I find the inclusiveness to be forced and burdensome. I also find it hard to stay focused in prayer or take what I'm saying seriously when he makes references to God as ""my unicorn"" and ""my snow leopard"". Some will take great comfort from this radical reinterpretation of compline, not so with me."
2,Fart Proudly,"Not a big fan of this book. There were parts of it that were very interesting. But in eneral, it got old for me very quickly."
1,Skip the last chapter,"An good collection of some of Ben's works. But the author uses this as a cover for hiw own political diatribe in the last chapter. There are other, better books that give a more complete look a Ben's life. Try them first."
2,Another side,"The book starts out great but ends in boringville... It's good to see the humorous side of Ben, but the author should have articulated a little better. The majority of the book is full of letters writtien in the hard to understand english of the day. The author could have translated and added more iput and guidance as to what they meant...Smirking and yet Confused..."
2,True Ben Franklin except for the last section,"The book was excellent and truely Benjamim Franklin until the last section titled ""The Dream"". The author put forward ideals as if they were spoken by Franklin, but definitely not ideals Franklin believed in. It is a ... plug for right-wing anti-government thinking. In the end of the book, it [was unsuccessful]. Don't waste your time."
2,Ben Doesn't Cut the Cheese With Me!!,"As a person who is very embarrassed to fart, which causes me great physical distress, I was hoping the great Benjamin Franklin would get me to loosen up about this topic we all deal with (some more than others). But he just couldn't bowel me over. I will have to look at other inspiration, probably ""The Gas We Pass: The Story of Farts"" (available through Amazon.com). If that stinks, then I'll have to loop the audiotape of Paula Abdul letting one rip during a radio interview about eight years ago. Life is gas, isn't it!"
1,There is nothing funny about farting.,"For some people, farting is a very serious problem. I have a friend who is unable to control himself and simply farts and farts and farts. It is very embarrassing for him. Doctors say that it is all in his head, but it's not."
4,The book is about the Ben Franklin I wish I knew in school,"Fart Proudly is a collection of Ben Franklin's lesser known but most interesting writings. They cover a variety of subjects but all exhibit Franklin's questioning nature and many show a sense of humor I never guessed present in Ben. The book's title is derived from a letter he wrote to the scholars at the Royal Collages in England, whom he considered petty and constipated. Highly recommended."
3,An iteresting read,I have to say that I rather enjoyed reading Franklin's lesser known works/letters. At one point I was even chuckling out loud.However the book was ruined at the end by the editor's own political agenda. He assumes to many things and discredits his own opinion about the freedom of speech (if it is true that no one is allowed to speak their mind or are afraid - how is it that you got published).My recommendation is to rip out that section of the book and enjoy what a gifted writer and thinker has to say - Ben Franklin
2,"Great start, bad finish","I bought this knife along with their carving knife for my wife as a Christmas gift. They were a huge hit at first although she was a little nervous because they were so sharp. The problem is that it showed pitting in less than 1 month. My wife thought it was because she had let it lay on the counter without drying it. Then the carving knife ended up doing the same thing and it was always hand washed and dried instantly. We came to the conclusion that it must be the knives themselves. Otherwise, these are a great product."
1,This book is a big commercial for Doug Halls Company!,The first half of this book dictates how great the author thinks he is and how soon he will change your way of thinking in the following chapters. That never happens. You get so sick of reading chapter after chapter of how giving squirt guns to adults changes these companies that you start to wonder just how stupid are these companies to let this joker in. Going out and getting some playdoe is not going cut it for my creative mind. I was looking for a better thought process. P.S. The book was just as shallow as the town he's from Cincinnati- need I say more.
2,Jump start Doug's ego...buy this book.,"It seems to me that this book could have had a lot more impact and would have proven much more credible if the author had spent more time on the real subject and less time on the subject of himself. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of good ideas in here. The message gets really bogged down though, with all this talk of ""I did this...I did that....I'm Ben Franklin reincarnated...yadda yadda yadda"". Hall ends up spending so much time off of the subject that it's easy to get lost and discouraged with reading this book. I'm glad if anyone finds something great in here, but I would have been happier with a shorter, leaner, and therefore, more effective version. If I were to write a book and get as far off of my subject as Hall has with this one, I would hope my editor would have the sense to hit me in the face with a humble pie.....oooh, now wouldn't that be creative!"
3,Ordinary,The book has a value it that it might inspire some to learn more about the creative thinking process. It would have been better if the author had added depth instead of superficial comments.
1,What a complete disaster!!!!!,"The stars giving here should be NEGATIVE 5 stars!! I was excited for this book to arrive, only to be horribly disappointed. I thought this book was totally stupid and immature ! I could only get through the first couple chapters than started skimming through the book only to find that each page after page was excatly the same thing.....there's nothing creative about it.....unless you like going back to kindergarten and acting childish, not sure how that improves one mind in the adult world.Do you seriously think that giving your boss a ""wedgie"" or throwing water balloons at someone is going to help one ""climb the corporate ladder"" ......just how does this ""jump start your brain"" ?????"
3,Good for Climbing out of the Box the First Time...,"Doug Hall's book on boosting creativity tosses people out of their box to think differently. The best way to sum up the book is a quote that he provides by Aldous Huxley. It states:""The secret of genius is to carry the spirit of the child into old age, which means never losing your enthusiasm.""The book starts out with the subjects: Recapturing Innocence, Recapturing Adventurousness, The Birth of Eureka! and more. It continues with many decent sections on how to stimulate the creative sides of our brains.Overall, Jump Start Your Brain is a decent book on creativity for people trying to climb out of their box first time. A fair amount of repetition, but this is needed for people to re-engage in creativity. Other books like: A Whack on the Side of the Head have more meat on the bones.The Re-Discovery of Common Sense: A Guide to: The Lost Art of Critical Thinking"
3,Good - but why plastic??,"I installed this about 2 years ago. Everything looked great with it except the plastic ""shower"" head area. I don't know why they made this plastic. Anyways, this is now all scratched up and turning green where the clamp holds it.Also, the option to turn the water to a ""powerful spray"" and it used to stay on, now it doesn't. It never did when the pressure was low, but now it doesn't want to at all.It started out as a good product, but the plastic head really makes it worth less than it sells for. However, comparable items are a lot more."
1,Many frustrating problems,"I had two Danze showerheads and one tub faucet installed. I thought I was buying an upper-end product and my contractor made me believe so. Not so. The one showerhead and tub faucet hold water (sometimes quite a bit) after being shut-off. They will then release the water in a few minutes to 1/2 hour. Frustrating when you squeegee the shower and it gets soaked again. The cartridges in both showers' handles have had to be replaced numerous times because of ""banging/pounding"" noise while using it. Now my plumber fixed them so that they are so tight and hard to turn that one of them actually squeaks as I attempt to turn the handle. It gets worse as time goes on. My plumber said the holding of the water is normal (yea, right) and the only way to keep the cartridges from rumbling to really tighten them. Lousy products (and contractor) - would never buy one again."
1,didn't last,"I was encouraged to buy this product.... identically made to Grohe but less expensive. So I bought it...looked decent enough....all metal assembly. But in less than 2 years, the cartridge assembly broke (plastic replacement promptly sent by Danze) and now the diverter (after 3 wks, still waiting for replacement). Had I known it was made in China, I would have paid more money for the German made Grohe, which was installed in my other bath years before and is still operating beautifully with no issues."
4,Beautiful Faucet!,"Bought this as part of my complete kitchen remodel. I love its industrial look and most visitors have commented on how they like it as well. I've had it installed for a few months now and had no problems. The build quality is great. The only plastic part,which I'm ok with for now, is the actual sprayer. In a few more years, hopefully it'll be holding up as well as it is now."
4,Easy to Install. Nice Looking.,"I bought this faucet recently to make it a focal point in my newly refurbished kitchen. The look was accomplished. I installed myself without any previous knowledge; it works fine; it is not the industrial quality you would find in commercial kitchens, not as sturdy but well for home use. I am happy with the product so far, guess if the handle where solid steel and not just the casing it would be perfect but more expensive."
2,spray head is made of made of plastic,"The spray head is made entirely of plastic, not stainless steel or brass as described in the product description"
2,Great faucet but lacks durabilty,We purchased and installed this faucet several years ago and we loved it. However about a year okay the chrome plating started to separate and come off the faucet head. We found that the head was made of plastic which would be fine if it had been durable. Still it was very functional until this morning. The spiral hose which is threaded through the spring assembly came apart... unraveled... spraying myself with hot water which then required a change of clothes. Now I am looking for a replacement spiral hose! It lasted less than 2 years.cj
2,Two problems in one month,Product arrived missing one install part. Part was shipped but after faucet was installed. Two weeks later the flexible hose broke leaking everywhere. Danze response was slow. It's working now but I've got my fingers crossed.
4,Graphic SF Reader,"This is made from more than one comic title, so the first part, Titans/Young Justice, has some obvious manga stylings. The later part is more straightforward, and involves battles on other planets, laying waste to a world, ancient gods, and a Sun-Eater, to top it all off.At the core though, is emotion - mostly centred around dead and not so dead girls, and women. With a funeral cameo by Superman and Batman, just because they can."
1,Disappointed,"For the money, I did not feel that this book offered as much information/detail as I would have liked. A considerable amount of the content is regulations/documents that are readily available on the web from a number of sites. Why pay this much for what you can print from the web in five minutes?Check it out before you buy it!"
4,Good training material for sites and IRBs,Does a good job of outlining the basics in an easy to digest format. We've made it part of new IRB staff and member training.
5,One of the best concert videos ever!!,"I'm not even the biggest Neil Young fan and this is my favorite concert video of all time. Most of Young's best electric songs done full-tilt. The only time I saw Young in concert was on this tour and it was amazing. I had the Laser Disc. It was never available on DVD, just Laser Disc and VHS. The Blu Ray edition of this concert is at the top of my wish list. Sadly, I think it will take a big grassroots movement to get this re-issued in HD. Until then, the CDs will have to do."
1,The Dayareamer,"Ten-year-old Peter Fortune has a vivid imagination. His imagination takes him to extraordinary places, but when it takes him to the place reality and daydreams meet."
1,Book review~*,I think this book is very boring.It wrote about the boy. The boy always dream in the day. I don't like to read anymore.It is very boring. The plot of this book is boring too.I think the pictures in this book is not so good. I really don't this kind of writing style. I think it is full of creative.
2,daydreamer,"Before reading this book i expected it to be original and full of character, i formed these opinions due to the front cover and the books title. How wrong could i be. Yes it is certainly original, but the content remains immature. The author has taken a different approach to this novel, he has choosen to write it in a very unique way but hasnt excelled in this. The idea and perphaps content could work but the style it is writen in is poor. The book has proven to be simple yet with a complex twist, however the way this is portrayed has made the content boring and"
3,Hmmm...,"Hmmm...at the begining, it is very boring and not interesting at all. Sometimes, I even want to stop reading this book.But after reading the middle part, i found that it was very interesting and Ifinish the whole book only for a few days."
2,The Daydreamer byIan McEwan,This book is about a a boy who daydreams. Each chapter tell a story/daydream about the boy dreams. it is full of new and differetn storys. i think there is a hidden meaning but yet i have nto found it (sorry)i shore it is much loved by many.
2,The Daydreamer,"I think some of the story in this book is very boring. But some of them are also very exicting and interesting. Although I think this book is teaching us how to do a daydreamer but the dream of the boy is very scary. I don't like to read the scary book so I think most of them is silly but this book make me think a lot.But it is still very, very boring."
2,The Daydreamer,"After I read this book,I thought that the first chapter of this book is very boring.The reason that I don't like this book is the pictures are not beautiful and there are only a few pictures.The other reason is that, I think Peter likes sleeping very much because he always dream a dream and all the dream are very scaring, I don't like scary story, that's why I hate this book very much."
2,oh boy oh boy,"This is a boy's story, and it's rather boring. It's only a boy's daydreaming. The writing style is so old-fashioned. Anyone serious about reading will hate this book."
2,Boring Daydremer!,"I really think this book is boring!When you only started reading a little part of it, you can guess the whole story line easily! I think this not really good. If I am the author, I think I will write something interesting and make you smile. And when you finish this book you can totally feel how the little boy daydream.Daydreaming is boring, if the book is also boring, I think you better put it down and start to do something that you like!I really do not suggest you to try this book."
2,The Daydreamer,"The name of this book is ""The Daydreamer"".Ian Mcewan wrote this book with his creative,but in fact, I am not very interested in reading it.Although some parts of this book are very interesting,like ""Vanishing Cream"" and ""The Grown-up"".I still not very pleased with this book because some chaptel like ""Introducing Peter"" and ""The Dolls"" are really very very boring..... This is the end...."
1,The day dreamer by Ian McEwan,This book was ...well ... should i say interesting.I didnt think that it had a particulalary interesting plot and after all the day dreaming it didnt lead to anything ??no exciting ending ??or thrilling cliff hanger ?? I dont think this book related to anything that peple our age are interested in and the language used was far too complicated for people younger than 12 to understand.As there are many twists aswell. Im sure that you could be a great writter only i didnt enjoy it sorry
1,A Boring Book,"this book's cover is searing ,but the story isn't very interesting story and it isn't searing ,too.I f you ask me will I introudce this book to my friend , I will said no. It is because I think all my friend will not like this book.It really very boring."
1,The Daydreamer,"I think that it is very boring, and is not interesting, and make the people read this book feel very sleepy and the words is quite difficult to read .I will don't advice people to read this book.When I reading this book ,I feel very sleepy and want to go to sleeping,I think thisn book is noy suitable to me to read ,so i will don't encourage my friends to read it. It is very boring to me to read.It is talk about the boy hoe to catch the thiefs but i think the story is so silly and stupid and talk about the story very slowly ,it is too bad for our this aged to read ,Finally,it is not a good book to me to read."
4,A Tiny Gem....,"It's a book that reminds you of the fact that there is a child in every adult, and an adult in every child.A charming one indeed."
3,Daniels Review,"I found this book enjoyable. However i did find it did not spread the imagination as far as possibal. It left you wanting to know more, but not gripped the whole way through. At parts its drags a bit, but there is enough entertainment to keep you going. All in all it is a good read but not one of the best i have read."
5,A very good book for all ages,The daydreamer is about a boy called Peter who is always daydreaming at the wrong time and the wrong place. It always gets him into trouble. My favourite part of the book was when he swapped bodies with the baby Kenneth. I would recommend this book to anybody who wants a good laugh and a good read. And I rate this book 10/10. By Daniel Rumsey
4,Recommending The Daydreamer,"By Cornelius, Grade 4I recommend this book to a person with a great imagination because Peter has a big imagination, too. Something that Peter imagined is he imagined that the burgalur which he called Soapy Sam was Ms.Goodgame, one of his neighbors!"
3,Mr.Daydreamer,"After reading a part of this book, I think this book is a little bit boring. The contents of this book is telling a boy has some funny and scary experiences. I also learnt some new words.And I think this need to add more interesting pictures to attrack readers."
3,My Brother and The Bad Doll: A review of The Daydreamer,"By Sonya, Grade 4You should read The Daydreamer by Ian McEwan! Many different kinds of people would like this book.I recommend this book to someone who is afraid of dolls. Peter is afraid of his sister Kate's doll. He had a dream that the doll came alive and said, ""I'll get your room someday!"" The doll wanted to have its own room"
1,Doesn't work,"I own three Apple devices and this cable does not transfer data for any of them. It will charge all three but nothing will sync. Ipod Classic, Ipod touch 4, Iphone 3GS."
5,great product,this product works great. I only wish that it came with the adapter. All in all this product is amazing.
2,Disappointing item,"I got the cord thinking it would free up a usb spot on my Mac by using the firewire. I was disappointed to find out that it will only charge the Ipod nano (3rd generation) and not synch it with the Mac. Apparently if I get a dock this problem may be solved, but without it it's just a charge cord."
1,Not an authentic apple product.,"I ordered two of these, and neither of them were authentic Apple products. How can I tell? The usual slogan written on authentic Apple iPod products goes like this: Designed by Apple in California Assembled in China *The fake cable, purchased here, doesn't have this printed on it.Don't buy. Not ""100% genuine Apple item"" as advertised."
1,Disappointed,"I received my order today, and it arrived damaged. I have not even tried to use it because I am sending it back. I hate wasting money."
2,Not for iPod with Video,The new iPods do not have the connections to work with FireWire. So this cable will only charge the new iPods with video. Besides this this is a good product for the iPods.
2,round chair,the only thing that i think is bad is that if it can fit in a wooden box then i don't think a person can fit in it and i want to be able to fit in it
3,reissue,"I bought the full size of this book several years with a different cover picture i thought this one was a different book but it is the same book only smaller with a different cover. The first of the book has really old pictures some in a collage which are really small. The later part which doesnt have enough of the 1940s,50s or 60s is lacking. If you dont think you already have this the price is great but this was released with a different cover years ago be warned i wish i was."
3,No Sense of Sin Part 2? Not quite.,"The follow-up to the fabulous 1984 record ""No Sense of Sin"" is finally here! (If you don't count the bbc sessions CD) Has it really been 17 years? The new CD has some shining moments that sound like they could have appeared on the bands debut. The signature guitar sounds and synth washes are present along with the classic vocal presentation that identifies the band as the Lotus Eaters. The songs on the CD with that formula are melodic and as good as anything on ""No Sense of Sin"". The Lotus Eater formula is sadly missing on about 30% of the tracks. The other 70% of the CD is superb. For fans of the band, this is alot of fun and shouldn't be missed. For beginners to the band: Look for ""No sense of Sin"" instead."
4,It was slick and well made.,"The leading lady was elegant and the movie was well made and did not look made down south.. Reminded me of ""Sin Nombre"" and ""No country for old Men"""
3,ms.bala,"I enjoyed the movie, however the role of ms. bala was a little disjointed, since she spent so much time, just sort of staring."
5,This is a great movie!,The movie is great! The online viewing is crisp and clear. Very satisfied with my purchase! Amazon has some of the best prices for online movies!
3,too many weird holes in the plot,"This should have worked on many levels--great topic (Mexican Drug War), weird subplots (from the beauty pageant to the who's doublecrossing whom) and some creative POV cinematography. Problem is I found the thing ponderously slow plus couldn't quite get if the bad guy is some big Tijuana drug kingpin, why doesn't he already have a secret mansion hideout? I get the federales are deeply involved in the drug trade hence the war in the first place but a lot of the ""ambushes"" seemed way too easy.I get where the lead character is supposed to play it cool out of fear of herself getting killed but I often felt she was just there and not really present in scenes. I guess it was the director's choice but other than a couple of tearful scenes, I just didn't buy the lead character at all.After reading two terrific books on current day Mexico (This Love Is Not For Cowards and El Narco) I expected that level of filmmaking."
4,Miss Bala,"Mexico's entry for this year's Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, Miss Bala is another one of those movies you probably haven't heard of, much less seen, unless you live in a major city. Loosely based on true events, the film follows a young Mexican beauty queen who becomes wrapped up with a gang of drug-runners as she competes for her crown. Though it received just a little buzz and opened for a short time in limited release, I found a lot to praise about the movie; it's a loaded film whose subject matter is already heavy, but is made even more powerful by some interesting directorial choices and an assured filmmaking style. Miss Bala is an unflinching, timely look at a side of Mexican culture much talked about but rarely explored in this fashion."
3,Japanese Farming,This book like One Straw Revolution details how to successfively grow different grain crops. I found it to be a bit wordy but it did give me some ideas about interplanting. There is some specific information in it but I do not believe that living in a hut without electricity is something I want to do. I do believe that we do need to get back to small farms rather than large industrial operations that are very vulnerable to plant disease etc. I agree that a more natural way of growing food produces a far better product and that artifical fertilizers are destroying the fertility of our soils.
3,Zero Character Development; Tarzan fights dinosaurs and prehistoric creatures,"Zero Character Development; Tarzan fights dinosaurs and prehistoric creatures.If you have read less than a hundred books, and you are under 20, and you like Tarzan, you will love this! Look for the book with a cover illustration by Boris (it shows a dinosaur).Edgar Rice Burroughs is great!"
2,I couldn't finish it !,"I tryed to finish it - and thank goodness I didn't buy it - terrible. Don't waste your time.If you are looking for a good historical romance check out Secrets of a Duchess by Kaitlin O'Riley ,From London With Love by Jenna Petersen and The Lady Lies by Samantha Saxon."
4,Cynster,"If you are reading the series, you need these entries. Laurens weaves her characters through their own stories and brings them back for her 'Black Cobra' series."
3,good escapist literature,"This is one of many of this loose ""series"". It was enjoyable, although her books have a definite pattern and are somewhat predictable if you read many of them. Definitely better if you read them separated by a chunk of time and other books!"
2,Cannot get into this book,"After about an hour and a half, I decided I wasn't investing any more time in this book because, frankly, I just don't care what happens to the characters. I gave it 2 stars based on the improbable possibility that the book, further on, somehow got more interesting or (at least)moderately plausible and a bit less silly. I doubt that it will, but I'm not willing to wade through more nonsense to find out."
1,"Same plot, same characters... why bother?","This book is just like the last 10 books by Stephanie Laurens. Domineering nobleman who can't bring himself to say ""I love you."" Insipid lady who is willing to have hot sex every night but won't marry until said domineering nobleman says he loves her. Endless descriptions of really boring sex, with something faintly resembling a plot stuck in between the sex scenes.This book is a waste of perfectly good trees. At least I got it from the library..."
2,Here we go... again..,"If you have just started reading Stephanie Laurens and her Cynster series, then you will enjoy this book. No one, absolutely no one writes a better, more involving sentence to set a scene then Ms Laurens. She can pull you into a moonlit night and take your breath away. Enjoy...BUT...If you are a long time fan, someone who has never left one of this author's books on the shelf, then you are tired... tired of the tired plots and even more tired characters. She blinked... He blinked... She nodded... he nodded... She wanted to know ALL.... He wanted to protect her ALWAYS... please, enough all ready.Such a waste of talent is almost sinful. And can I please ask: where are her editors? Who is saying, fine, give the hero and heroine a new name and location and mail it in? Save your money, re-read A Rake's Vow."
3,Awfully wordy for not much happening,"Usually like Stephanie Laurens but this book is just very wordy sex scenes around a minimal plot. Seriously, the sex scenes go on & on & on. I find myself just turning pages & reading the last sentence of each to see if we are back to the real story yet. Plodding to get through. Wish I'd just picked it up at the library."
4,fun with communism,"i found this book to be amusing and i enjoyed its sarcastic tone... it is important to remembr it is not supposed to be informative, per se, but it's purpose is to look back on some of the more ridiculous things that america has been involved in. it is full of pictures and stories and stuff like that... it is great for people who look at the cold war and have to shake their heads, but it it is not for those who are patriotic. overall, it is a good oddity to have on one's bookshelf. too bad it's out of print..."
3,"ah, the good old days ...","Better Dead Than Red is a semi-sarcastic look at the anti-communist hysteria that swept America following WWII. While the information it provides on the time is accurate, many of America's fears (and precautions) seem now incredibly ridiculous and naiive - as in the directions on ""how to build a backyard nuclear shelter"" for example. Barson makes no judgements on the attitudes and behaviours of the time, which is a strength of the book, and serves to underline the silliness that possessed many Americans. An interesting examiniation of a (thankfully) by-gone era."
1,A good book to remain out of print.,"Even in 1992, there was considerable evidence that the CPUSA was an active arm of the Soviet state operating within the United States, and material almost simultaneously coming from Soviet archives has proven it. Red scare fears were frequently misdirected, but that is not the same as being imaginary. While it is true that this book is not meant to be history as such, its snidely ignorant tone destroys what fun there might have been in its content. Those actually interested in the period might start with the documentary works by John Earl Haynes et al, and leave Mr. Barson's in the dustbin of history where it belongs."
5,My daughter loves these things!,"My daughter loves these so much, I bought her a spare pair! She says the sound quality is great, which it must be because she can't hear me when she has them on! They look stylish too, a nice departure from the traditional black color."
4,"oh yeah,...","i purchased this cologne for my boyfriend...it smells so good. i almost don't want him to wear it out b/c other women hit on him alot..lol but its alright, i know he's mine. oh, btw, the shipping was very fast on this item which is a plus"
1,THIS PRODUCT PICTURE IS NOT WHAT I ORDERED.,"I GOT WHAT I ORDERED, UNFORTUNATELY THE PICTURE ON THIS REVIES IS NOT WHAT I ORDERED. FOR THE COLOGNE THAT I RECEIVED, IT IS THE RALPH LAUREN 2.5OZ COLOGNE SPRAY. IT WAS NOT AS STRONG AS IT SHOULD BE, BUT I CANNOT COMPLAIN. I GOT WHAT I PAID FOR, NEXT TIME I WILL BE PURCHASING FROM A LOCAL STORE INSTEAD."
1,Duplicate from amazon,This polo black I got from amazon appears to be duplicate. After spraying significant amount I still can't smell it nor people around me. Also amazon won't take it back. Plz beware before u buy this item from amazon.
1,polo black sent by amazon,I think the polo black sent by amazon is either a duplicate or an expired one because being a vivid user of polo black when i applied this copy sent by amazon the smell is just like a plain alcohol and nothing like the original black.all the aroma of mango and other ingredients are just not there. so watch it before you order from amazon.
5,Too many compliments,"Everyday I wear this I get a compliment from the ladies. Guys if you want to be attractive, add this cologne. Actually I should be telling you not to buy so I can have the advantage. Hahaha."
1,Horrible,"This product is not what the real stuff smells like. It has a strong alochl smell. I thought it was to good to be true and it was. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!! Wast of money!'!!!!!!!!!!!,"
1,insatisfecho,"El producto recibido no era lo que esperaba, la fragancia tenia un olor diferente a la original y no me gustogracias de todos formas"
1,Untrustworthy Retailer,"After ordering this product, retailer never communicated. Amazon informed me that they had not heard from retailer either and went ahead and cancelled the order for me. I wrote to retailer, and they never responded."
2,Doesn't smell so good !!!,I have tested this spray before but after owning it I really don't like it. There is a strong bad smell right when you put it on that gradually desolves but a little always stays. I like the other Polos much more
4,Excellent Job by Polo,"This cologne is the stuff you wanna wear everyday. Just to warn you the smell off the bottle might give you the wrong impression but once you wear it, in about 5 min you'll start smelling like how its suppose to smell. It starts of very strong and becomes spicy and ends kinda sweet (not too fond of that thou). This would indubitably in my top 5 colognes to wear. You can wear this anywhere from work to parties. Its got some professional smell to it which makes it good to wear it at work yet romantic without setting out 'I am desperate' smell.I would recommend getting a sample from ebay or some other sites before i buy the whole big box since fragrance it totally unique to every individual."
4,It's Ok,This product is for someone maybe in their mid to late 30's because it's a tad strong scent. I'm in my early 20's and need something lighter and fresh like dolce&gabana light blue or armani code(black).
4,good product good price,I bought it for my boyfriend and he loved it he buys it from this site all the time and it always makes him happy
1,watered down,"When i received the item the cologne had leaked out of the top and all over the bottle which dissolved the paint on the glass making a large mess, the seller replied with a large partial return of 50% of the purchase price, while at first i chalked it up to great customer service, i now think it was more likely due to guilt and an effort to save his behind, the smell is strong for maybe 30 minutes then its almost gone, noone can smell it at all, whereas in the past i've purchased from the store and it was great all day long, while not over powering, fragrance is great, but watered down"
3,"The smell is wonderful, however I think this one was a fake.","I love the smell of Polo Black. I always get compliments from the woman. However, with this product, I did't see it to last as how my other one did...and the other one (that obviously ran out, so I came here to buy one for cheaper..which I never will do again) lasted all day..and it was great..this one only lasts for like 30 minutes and then you don't smell it anymore unless you smell it closely..but not when you walk by.... this product was a fake..i think the seller mixed it with water or something..I am extremely disappointed that I spent this kind of money on it and it is a fake."
1,possible fake,I purchased this as an exact replacement. The first use was extremely disappointing. It is about half as potent and doesn't smell the same as the old bottle that was almost empty. I had my wife also smell the difference between the bottles. She laughed and said they were not even close. I don't believe these are real.
3,"I would give it a ""Good"" rating.",spray seems to be weak. I don't think I would order from this seller again.
5,This Is Music At It's Very Best,"It is very sad that music, or at least music festivals, are not this good anymore. While the music on this album is very good, it can't really be questioned when the likes of Harrison and Dylan are on the same album, the album also represents a philosophy that doesn't seem to exist anymore - that we should help each other. This album captures a time when there was hope for the future and when music represented a desire to make a better world - not just make more money.Buy this album for the music or the philosophy - it still sounds great and maybe it helps us remember a time when people cared about each other - even if they lived on the other side of the planet."
4,GETTING A LITTLE DATED BUT!!!,"ALTHOUGH THIS RECORD NOW SEEMS OUTDATED WITH ALL ITS HIPPIE DIPPY PEACE AND LOVE STUFF. IT IS STILL A GOOD RECORD. THERE IS RINGO, GEORGE, ERIC AND BOB DYLAN ALL ON THIS THIS AND LIVE. IT STILL IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES. HOWEVER, THE SITAR MUSIC. I HAVE NEVER, EVER LISTENED TO."
4,Great climbing harness,I bought this harness mainly to tie myself into my very tall trees in order to prune them. It worked quite well and make me feel quite secure while wielding a chain saw 30' above the ground!
4,Underband Ouch!,"I agree with everything said about this product but I don't see my one complaint in the reviews. I have been using 4434 for over 5 years, now. Many of them. I need to replace them more often than other bras because of what happens to the underband: elastic/fabric pilling! The band across the ribcage begins to pill up into mean abrasive little knots. I have tried handwashing, machine washing on delicate, no help. Tried using the loosest hooks and even gone up 2 sizes. I have also gently shaved them off with a razor, only to have them reappear. (See how much I like this thing?) The pills make the band feel like harsh low grade sandpaper and I have red marks on my skin when I remove the bra. The pills start after wearing the bras for 3-4 months. I >>love<< this product and will continue to purchase them. I just wish the rib-banding was as high quality as the rest of the bra."
3,wasnt true too size,sorry this item wasnt that great had too et a bra extender cause was the right fit I measured it and was off by 2 inches
4,Yesteday's Tragedy: A review of MidWinter Mourning,"This book, written by Mary J. Schneider, is the story of a small town and how a fire of great magnitude affected all of its residents. I enjoyed this book very much. I have lived in Boyertown my whole life and this book gave me a bit of its history. It tells how some 300 people were looking forward to a night of culture and fun, but it turned into a diasaster. Many were killed or injured. Kids left without their parents. Parents without their kids. Though i feel it was the greatest tragedy to ever touch Boyertown, few ever chose to talk about it again. That is why it is called the forgotten fire. If you would like to learn the history of a small, quaint town in Pennsylvania, this is the book for you."
2,Weak on both UML and Java,"The original version of the book was written in 1990 and despite the updated title and the notation 4th edition, there is much in this book that hasn't been updated. The UML aspect of the book is very weak and Java is given only a cursory treatment.The (obviously) older material is well presented and well referenced as chapter end notes but newer topics such as Extreme Programming (Beck), Refactoring (Fowler), etc. are absent from discussion completely.If you're looking for a good UML book try ""UML Distilled"" (Fowler) which provides a succint overview of the topic in considerably fewer pages. If you're looking for a book on Software Engineering there are several offerings which provide a solid, more current overview. This book attempts to do both and ends up doing neither."
4,Object & Java,I want to read this book on line .Because I am very much like to Object Oriented Books.
4,Did not solve my problem but I may have been asking too much,"I ordered this to quiet my noisy dishwasher. I removed the front panel and lined it with the acoustic foam using the adhesive backing that is on the material. The foam cut easily and the adhesive seemed to be very strong. I have no worries about the product shifting around. I do recommend being careful when placing the foam, I would imagine it would be very hard to remove and reposition.As far as performance it did seem to reduce the noise level coming from my dishwasher but not to a level that it doesn't disturb tv viewing or quiet conversation. It may take further steps such as a exterior wrapping to attain the level I desire.I was also planning on using the leftover amount to quiet a HTPC, but the foam was too thick for my case and I didn't want to impede any fans/airflow.I would recommend this product to others as it seems to be well made and may provide them with the results they desire depending on the application."
2,Not Color in Pic,"Picture depicts this as BLACK. Not even dark gray. Pretty pricey for what you get. Can buy green high density foam twice this thick for half this price. But, I didn't want green or gray foam, I wanted black. No recomendations"
3,"Not exactly a ""sonic barrier"" - more like sonic dampener","I purchased this to make a layer over my bedroom door with the hope that it would keep noise out (my housemates stay up later than me, and I'm a light sleeper). It's not a barrier, for certain, but it is mildly helpful. I think it does a better job of dampening noise in my room and keeping it from getting out than it does for keeping noise from getting in. Perhaps I should have applied it to the outside of my door and not the inside, but it's too late now. In short, place it where you want it to absorb the noise –it does't ""block,"" it ""absorbs."""
2,Check before accepting from shipper! Bad packing!,"When I received my refrigerator, the bottom of the box was not attached. One strap was holding the whole thing together. The packing material was a joke, it had the thinnest foam board I've ever seen as protection. I can't seem to find a temperature that is satisfactory. I either have warm sodas or they explode because they freeze. I'm still hoping I find that happy medium. Make sure you check this guy out before accepting it from the shipper!"
2,Arrived with a big dent,"Poorly packaged: arrived with a large dent in the side, perforating right through the metal. Very disappointing."
1,BEWARE,"I was completely EMBARASSED by the services provided by amazon.com. I ordered this product as a 21st birthday present for my boyfriend and when the first unit arrived it was missing one leg, cracked on the top and the sides, and the sides were so bowed out that the paint had started to chip. So I, being optimistic decided to try again. While at least the second unit has all of its parts, it was still cracked, bowed, and peeling. Neither amazon nor Haiber know the value of proper packaging and handling, so avoid the stress and waste of time."
1,Should have listened to the warnings!,"Just received this item from UPS. No additional packaging material besides the original box which was in fairly bad shape. Opened the box to find the frig. THRASHED! Dents on the corners, dents along the edges, cracked hinge cover, etc. Doesn't stop there... It appeared frig. may have been a used return! Packaging tape used to secure internal items like the door and shelves were cut open and the bottom feet were dirty and scratched as if the unit had been slid around on a hard floor.This unit really should not be shipped without additional packaging. Otherwise, it looked nice and if not for the damaged condition looked to be built fairly well. Too bad, finding a self-defrosting mini frig. at $99 with no shipping is hard to beat.Received a replacement via FedEx the other day... Again, THRASHED! This thing is sent in the manufacturers box only which is completely inadequate."
3,Received in good condition.,"We ordered this despite the poor shipping reviews as a gift and it arrived in good condition. The box does not have much padding or protection to cushion the cooler, so it is easy to see how it could be damaged, but I am hopeful that after the September 04 comments that maybe the packaging will be improved by the manufacturer. So far, our experience has been a good one, but it sounds like we lucked out!"
1,Shipping,I too have had a hard time getting this product to arrive in any usable condition. I had two shipped to me and the packing was nothing more than a thin cardboard box. I have notified the company but i have had no response back from them?
3,Cooler blues,"Refrig arrived with defective top hinge breacket. On the second attempt at customer service, I got a replacement shipped in about 1 1/2 weeks.I am still attempting to get the thermostat somewhere between frozen beer and luke warm."
2,Dented and cracked upon delivery,"I am very disappointed. It's like they take the fridge, stuff it into a box the same size as it, and ship it.No pride taken in their work whatsoever."
3,Indie film with SFX,"This film had some decent special effects for an indie film. The plot was okay. The acting was definitely B- or C.The best dialogue/scene in the movie is when a blonde woman is describing life outside the walled-off LA....Blonde Woman: ""....then he was broadcasting on his spam radio...""Brunette Woman: ""Ham radio"" (correcting the blonde woman)Blonde Woman: Just rolls her eyes and goes on talking.It didn't deserve the one star that the first reviewer gave it, but it doesn't deserve five stars either - it's not in the same league as Paranormal Activity (for an indie made film). This reminds me of a Syfy made film, albeit one of their better made films."
1,Not worth the money,"Don't know why some gave this movie Four Stars. One of the worst movies I have seen and rented. This is a low budget B-movie? with poorly done CGI effects, terrible plot, and bad acting. So boring I had to fast forward. Movie is nowhere near Battle: Los Angeles. If you are seriously considering to purchase this for $26, read more reviews from movie review websites first."
4,ALIEN ARMAGEDDON,"An interesting take on an invasion from outer space (or possibly inner space). For me, I can only say I was entertained for length of the movie which was 90 minutes. Why else do we watch movies? The production and acting were good as were the effects."
1,Beyond Garbage!,"Unbelievable. I rented this for only a buck, and I still feel cheated. Why would anyone want to produce, or be associated with, such a pile? This gagger should be dovetailed with XXX porno. Same low-grade production as most adult films but not even a bare chest to justify it's existence. Redbox, I want my dollar back!"
1,Drink coaster,"I should have look at others reviews first before buying this Blu ray. Total piece of garbage. Even the video affects look so lame. For the flames they should have at least held matches in front of the camera, it would have looked more real. Even Attack of the Killer Tomatoes was more entertaining than this trash."
1,could I give it less than half a star?,"I'm in TOTAL agreement with the previous negative critiques...if not more so. I want back the 15 minutes of my life I wasted on this. Even the plastic to make the DVD was wasted on this. And who over the age of 6 could possibly rate this 5 stars?? Seriously, don't even look twice at this thing."
1,Alien Armageddon,"Absolute crap! It was terrible, definately a B movie!! I'd be surprised if the budget hit 5 figures! At one point a girl gets shot, falls on the ground and the camera zooms in on her and her gun....LMFAO, it was a spraypainted NERF gun!! you could see the lightning bolt NERF logo.Avoid!!"
4,Strange and funny,"Funny in a really weird, offbeat way. Though a bit too sentimental at times and uneven in tone."
4,A little bland,"This is an adequate review book for students already familiar with basic concepts. However, I found that it lacked the high-yield hits or points of emphasis that would help one remember the most important aspects of a given subject. I suggest reading this book after First Aid."
2,Lots of High yield info,"This book has a lot of useful info, probably more than 1st Aid, and the outline format organization is great to follow. So I think its best to either go with this book or 1st Aid. I recommend 1st Aid. It worked for me."
4,Mac friendly,"I needed a bag to transport my 17"" MacBook Pro, and the search for the right one yielded few results. This bag was one of the only ones big enough to handle my laptop. Luckily for me, it is very durable and has space to hold all the cords and associated junk I have to carry with me. In fact, it can hold a couple DVDs and even some books which makes it perfect for train rides where I need to do work and entertain myself. My only complaint is that I wish it was maybe a quarter of an inch longer so it wasn't so difficult to toss my laptop in there in a hurry. I guess the tight fit isn't a bad thing, since it ensures the laptop is safe, but I'm impatient."
3,Street Wars,The crackhouse in the movie was the wildest I ever seen. The special effects were kinda old. But it will take you a ride in the street underworld. I like the chicano guy in the begining he was a natural.
2,FORD ONLY!,"While the description states it works for 1994 and newer Chrysler/Jeep vehicles...it does not. I tried it on my 98 Grand Cherokee, a friends 2007 Sebring, and a 2008 300. The coupling tool didn't work for any of them. While I did not try it on any 1981+ Fords, I'd have to assume it'd work for them since that's the only other vehicle listed.Aside from them not working for my application, overall the product quality is not the best. Remember, it's plastic. Anyone who has done work with spring couplings will know that these won't last. If you're getting them for a one time fix (why I got these), they're good enough and cheap. Anything more than that, go with a better quality tool."
1,Extremely Poor Quality,"This product is of extremely poor quality. A lot of the parts to put it together are missing. It is cheap plastic and several of the screws stripped out while trying to put it together. Once together is was crooked. The box says Made In The USA, yet several packaging pieces said Made in China. I was very disappointed and this is going straight back to Amazon. Buyer Beware."
4,spice rack,"I ordered this as an add on to one that I already have and love. I needed more space so I got the second one to stack on it. Although it had the same photo and discription as the original I bought, this one has a different finish and is not the bright polished stainless steel of the original one. A bit of a disappointment. Since I really wanted the stacking unit, I will have to juggle the spice containers between the two tiers to create an alternating pattern. It is very convenient and neat as well as easy to fill."
3,Cheaply made,"While the item stacks well and nicely organizes a cabinet, I was not happy with the quality. Some of the containers do not snap in tightly. Since the window is not sealed and the face is only a cheap plastic overlay, fine spices such as cinnamon have a tendancy to leak and make a mess. I also think the snap-top closures may wear over time. Some already don't seal well. For keeping spices fresh, it's important to have tightly sealed containers. Don't think these will fit the bill. But, we are keeping the product and plan to give it a try because they fit in our narrow cabinet."
1,Terrific gift for a cook/chef!,"My friend was ecstatic when she opened up this present from me at the holidays. She claims it's the best spice rack - very durable, stylish, and doesn't take up too much space on the kitchen counter. To prove her point, she went and bought fresh spices and made her own personalized spice rack. Definitely was a hit!"
5,Terrific - all the way around!,"I love this book - along with Way Out West. I have given it to my nephews/niece and two grandsons. All of them loved the stories - along with the artwork. There just aren't enough nice things to be said, but I can't imagine any kid's library being complete without having these books in it! By the way, I bought the hard-bound copies for myself!"
1,research vs writing,"The research for this book is admirable and thorough, but the writing is so academic and dull as to make reading it almost impossible. There are other books more engagingly written that a potential buyer might want to search out."
4,"fast paced, energetic, roller coaster ride","This is a very busy book. Many storylines that intertwine and eventually come together at the end, when everything plotwise goes to hell. This was a very enjoyable book to read, and quick read, you're not going to be challenged here, but for gen-x readers, these are the kinda books that we like. Characters that we can identify, especially Paris, a man, in his 20s, who just wants a shot at the big time. Read it and enjoy"
1,Good Writing -- Poor Story,"The critics are correct; Ridley IS a talented writer with a gift for certain character styles. The sad thing about this book is that the wonderful writing is overshadowed by an awful plot and characters you more than likely won't care about. Some writers make the mistake of having a good story and writing it poorly, expecting the plot to make up for it. Ridley has done the opposite, and expected his gifted writing to make up for a predictable, asinine, unengaging plot. There are no twists, exactly what you think is going to happen does, and the feeling you have after reading this book will be the same as binging on junk food. It tastes good at first, but as soon as you're done, you'll wonder why the hell you bothered."
1,LAZY WRITING,"After a promising start, this book was pretty disappointing. I think he made it up as he went along. The only surprises or so-called twists are a few highly unlikely coincidences he needed to drive the story forward. No apparent effort to give depth to the characters or layers to the plot. He should stick to movies."
2,Everybody Just Smokes,"This book serves as an interesting read and is well prosed, but Ridley flat out drops the ball with the plot. Predictable, amusing, cute, whatever you want to call it; you've sen one Tarnatino you've seen 'em all. Benjamin Franklin once said ""The learned fool has the ability to express his nonsense to the unlearned, but in the end it is still nonsense."" I will give Ridley props on one thing, that Brice chick got me going."
1,It's not like I'm particularly picky...,"This book irritated me greatly. Not only were the characters extremely underdeveloped and uninspiring, the writing literally made me cringe with a far greater frequency I can tolerate in a novel. Tense shifts and choppy, rambling sentances abounded. I'd prefer having my teeth drilled to reading more of this sort of tripe."
5,It's Not Surprising That All His Books Get Made Into Movies,"The way John Ridley writes is like an explosion of moving pictures, vivid and exciting, one take after the next. Everybody Smokes In Hell wasn't a short read, but the fast pace and wild ride make it a weekend read."
3,Disappointed,"Loved the idea of this toy for a 12 year old newphew that is more into electronic media than games. Inately he loves to destroy things, so it was a perfect fit. When we played it, the game lacked the sizzle to keep everyone engaged. We struggled with the rules, the order of taking turns didn't make sense. The workmanship and quality is great, Maybe it is better for the 6-12 year old range."
3,the binicular is good,"the binicular is good, but the vivitar parabra not appear, either in binicular or purse.and if the mark should appear somewhere.by others so good.Vivitar 7 x 50 Binoculars"
4,Good quality for the price,I just bought them today at a drug store and I have had no problems.Compaired to the 1960's 1 by 46 Binoculars have its a huge upgrade.I would suggest this to anyone who wants to start off with star gazeing or bird watching.
5,excellent bargain,"excellent quality binoculars, for an amazingly low price.shipped on time. No complaints whatsoever."
1,I do not recommend this one to anybody.,"It is too big, and does not work as well as I expected. The price is also too high for such a binocular."
1,BAD QUALITY,"Purchased because of very low price and 7x50 spec. I didn't expect great quality at this price, but did expect them to be useable. First one produced double vision. Took it back to Walgreens for another. The 2nd one has single vision but focus was so poor that I couldn't read a small distant sign that was absolutely clear with my other brand (low cost) 7x50.Vivitar should be ashamed of themselves for selling such low grade trash. If you are tempted to buy these, go to a store where you can test a few and pick the best one."
1,Poor Quality Control,"I purchased and returned this product twice and then gave up and got a refund. In my opinion, either the product is defective or is packaged poorly. Both times the binoculars exhibited double vision. I was surprised that a Vivitar product would perform so poorly."
1,didn't know what bad binocs were,"didn't know what bad binocs were, until I tried these. My 8x42 has a far wider view. This 7x50 is very difficult to use for me due to collimation issues. Color problems and very small views. Someone might be able to find its $10 Walgreens price valuable."
1,A piece of junk at ANY price!,"My assessment after only ten minutes:I was able to get a very clear, focussed image rather easily. However, it's VERY poorly constructed! The left eyepiece came loose and cannot be secured again, and the ""eyecup"" to which the manual refers is non-existent (eyeglass wearers are supposed to be able to roll them down for better field of view). All four lens covers were so loose as to fall off easily (thus could easily get lost), and the strap was thin, cheap, and already frayed. And a small cap was missing entirely - the one that covers the pivoting screw for the eyepieces.A piece of junk...."
1,You get what you pay for,"I knew going into Walgreens that these were not going to be the best quality, so I don't feel to bad that I only spent $9.99 on them. Vivitar is not know for any great quality. They work fine for just general viewing during the day and evening. The quality is subpar. They are hard to focus since the focus adjustment seems to stick and they use plastic parts on them. The carry strap is so cheap that it was frayed on the ends and the strap keepers do not work. I like the pouch and the feel of the optics. These are fine to keep in your car, tool box, take to a ball game etc...If you dont care about price or if they get banged around, these are for you."
3,At this price it it could be a good deal,These look great from a distance but the eyepiece mechanism is poorly designed and held on with a single screw (that was loose on mine.) Once tightened they worked good enough but the eyepieces were not level so focus was off on one or other eye. They do have two big bright 50mm lenses to bring in lots of light for use at night. If you want something to last spend $30 on some better built 7 x 50's. Mine were $10 at Walgreens so didnt expect much.
1,Stay away from this........,"This ""thing"" it's not worth a single dollar.I got for US$ 9.99 but the price should've been .99 cents. and free shipping.If you can believe, EVEN the lint free cloth to clean the lens has a LOT of lint on it.At least to say something positive, THE PLASTIC/RUBBER IS BLACK."
4,The Better Choice,"There are two DVDs available of Jenufa, and this is slightly the better choice for musical reason. Neither production satisfies my conception of this great and moving opera. Both are somewhat dramatically turgid. The flaws of this production are chiefly visual and acoustical, as pointed out by other reviewers. It really is a problem, on a DVD movie scale, that Roberta Alexander simply doesn't ""look the part"" though she acts with conviction; in an opera house, the same production would be sublime.Janacek is a composer who integrates the voices and the orchestra with great success; that ensemble effect is not captured well on either DVD production (and I confess that it's often not achieved in live performances either). The sound on this DVD is distant played at lower volume, tinny played at higher.Five stars for the opera itself, three for the realization."
4,A Great Opera -- a slightly disappointing Release,"Jenufa -- Leos Janacek's ""breakout"" composition -- had a long and in some ways turgid performance history. The present recording, using the ""original"" score (before major revisions by the composer in the 1920s) is welcome if only for the ability to compare Janacek's original intention with his later reflections and alterations. Having said that, the audio quality lacks immediacy and presence and the otherwise excellent production values are ultimately hindered by the lackluster sound. Indeed, after viewing this DVD I immediately took out the MacKerras Jenufa recording (Elizabeth Soderstrum) to remind me just exactly how this magnificent opera is supposed to ""sound."" It's a pity that there is not another DVD available; this opera deserves the widest possible audience."
5,Keeps your attention,Right from the start you are captured by the intriguing story. Got to keep track of the characters but the lessons learned from this book are great. Enjoy
5,Tracie Peterson does it again!,"Once again, Tracie Peterson has woven a wonderful story that captures your attention and makes you examine your own heart. A Slender Thread is the story of five sisters and their wise grandmother who raised them. The story weaves you though each of their lives, showing how families can be so close, yet so far apart. You are able to identify with each sister and her personal struggles, as well as how this causes problems within the family. You will laugh and cry with Maggie and cheer her decisions on how to prove a much needed point to her granddaughters. I couldn't put it down. A must read for anyone with siblings - especially sisters - and even more so if you don't always get along!"
4,Great Book!,"I think the thing I enjoyed most about this book was the interplay of the five sisters. Each of them are very different and I think that the author did a good job of giving each of them depth and also weaving the story around each of their lives, but also joining it together at the end. I enjoyed the setting of their grandmother's farm in Kansas and also the use of quilts in story. I definitely would recommend this book."
1,Not as pictured and poor quality,"Not as advertised! I purchased these jack stands because of the pinch weld cut-out in the picture. Well, they don't actually have that, which is MEGA LAME.Also, right out of the box, the paint was chipped off in over 20 locations and neither jack sits squarely on the floor -- they always teeter. The quality seems poor -- I would avoid these."
3,It does what it should do,"Useful PAL accessory to carry the PAL around together with an ipod in the side pocket.Why just 3 stars?1. It's just a bag, of course, hardly anything to get excited about.2. It's a pity that the power supply doesn't fit in a side pocket."
5,Not so easy to find these days,"I couldn't find these in my local hardware store, so I stocked up when I found them online. It amazes me that everything is shifting to CFL or LED bulbs which have different attachment types... lots of furniture requirese these odd shaped bulbs. (Also, CFL bulbs are not nearly as long-lasting or efficient as advertised.)"
4,Nicely done book of Civil War photos,"If you're a Civil War buff, you've seen mostly all of these pictures--U.S. Grant leaning against a tree, a grainy picture of Lee sitting on Traveller, a towering Abe Lincoln standing Shaq-like above McClellen and his staff--yep, same old, same old. Time-Life even recycled the captions from previous publications. That said, this is still a good collection, we all love to look at the same old photos because the Civil War was, and still is, a defining point in America's history."
5,I finally own my favorite book,"This has always been one of my favorite books. It's entertaining and, while not quite what one would normally encounter in real life, at least more believable than those romance novels where the two protagonists meet and fall in love in a matter of days. Polly Shulman has stretched this out over a more realistic several months and fills the space between with amusing anecdotes and the compelling voice of Julie Lefkowitz. For several years now, I checked this out whenever I found it in the library, and I recently decided to add it to my personal library. It was a very wise decision and I do not regret it."
1,No enthusiasm for this novel,"Everything about Polly Shulman's debut novel reeks of cliche concepts and unoriginal ideas. Had I wanted to read Pride and Prejudice, I would have pulled it out of my library rather than reading this contrived, third rate facsimile.The first 30 pages absolutely dragged, and that pace continued throughout, to the unsatisfying conclusion. A waste of time, and a definite recomendation to avoid this debut novel. I have no ""Enthusiasm"" for any sort of followup efforts by this author."
2,Eh,"I didn't like it. The premise is all right, but that's about it. The author may have a good sense of humor, but the book is not very funny. I can tell what the jokes are, but they're not laugh-out-loud kind of jokes. It gets pretty dull after a while. The characters are also too two-dimensional. Even after 90 pages, I couldn't figure out how the main character is really like. She seems mature for the most part but she occasionally says very childish things. I'm guessing that there's also some self-insert.Overally, not a very good book. I like Ashleigh, and that's about it."
2,Dated and old skool,Classic Weaver stance text book which has been left behind by new techniques. If you want to see how your Dad was taught in the 80s then this book is for you!
2,not very good..,i'm disapointed with this outing from franklin. i've only read one other of his books. i could only read an hour here.
2,Ok but Not what I expected.....,"I was looking for a game to get over my addiction of DOCWE. For those of you that dont know DOCWE is a horse breeding & racing simulation game only found in gamerooms such as Jillians, Gameworks or Dave & Buster's. It's called the Derby Owners Club World Edition. We were very interested in finding a game similar to that one and heard about this game. Although this game is ok it's just not what I expected. It's not to say that this isn't a great game it's just not exactly what I was hoping it would be. Its a bit more difficult than I imagined and it was just not what I was looking for."
3,Hardcore fans will love it but the casual will struggle.,"If you are not into competitive games, you will have a bit of difficulty understanding how to win even one race or going through the menus.This game would be great for hardcore fans of horse racing, where you will actually have to think like a jockey."
4,i was very dissapointed....,"when i got this game, i was hoping for something like the 2004 edition. this game was a big dissapointment to me. it is still fun, just not as fun as i expected. for those of you who have never played any other gallop racer games, you may give this game 5 stars, but if you play gallop racer 2004, you will rethink your rating. please buy gallop racer 2004,2003,or 2001 instead."
