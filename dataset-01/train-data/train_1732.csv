5,Thomas blue ray - blue mountain mystery,"Whole family enjoyed movie.Blue Ray quality is very crisp and makes for impressive animation.Good Story, kept our interest.Fast Delivery and fair price."
5,Easy to memorize,"My 2-year-old loves having her very own Bible and reads stories from the book every night. The rhymes are simple, yet thoughtful and humorous at times, and the sing-song cadence allows toddlers to quickly memorize the stories. My daughter's favorite story is about ""Noah's boat,"" as she says, and after a few weeks was able to recite the story herself. We even bought her a toy ark to reinforce the story. She has now memorized several of her favorite stories.It's been such a joy to see her, at an early age, enjoy reading about God, Jesus, and the lives of His followers."
3,"Basically good, but not good enough","This book is good as an introduction to the Bible - unfortunately, similar to the Rhyme Bible Storybook, the rhymes sometimes take a bit of liberty with the Word in order to achieve the rhyming effect. I don't have it with me right now so I can't quote actual examples which didn't carry the ideas across as well as we wanted it - but that was our conclusion. The rhyming is also weak especially since we own a bunch of books by Dr Seuss which our 1 1/2 year old son loves and can recite. Along with pastel pictures, his imagination just wasn't captured and he has never asked to read this book again.But if simple rhyming and light colours attract your child, this is an adequate introduction to the Bible stories."
3,Ok but...,They did an ok job of writing - The rymes are good and they make sense but they take away from the meaning of some of the stories and I wish they had sought to bring God more into the stories - since this book is about Him in the first palce.So all in all I'd buy it again cause I love reading it to my daughter but would have liked to have seen them try harder to get more grounded truth into the rymes.Maybe thats asking too much with how simple they made it but why not ask for the moon when it comes the God's Word?Thanks for your efforts and would recomend to someone with a child 3 and under.
5,Love this book!,"We bought this for our son's Easter basket and absolutely love it. The stories are very short but the pictures are great, the rhymes are clever, and it keeps our baby's attention. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a fun bible storybook for their baby. It does not go into any bible stories with much detail but it's quick and easy reading. It is a good way to start to share the bible with your child."
4,Great Introduction to Bible Stories,This book is a great intro for toddlers to learn the bible stories we all know and love. Each story is told in a unique rhyme that covers about 3-4 pages. Pictures are good but I would prefer to see a multi-cultural cast of characters. Overall I am very pleased and my 2yr old can sit still long enough to listen to a few stories at a time.
5,perfect for our needs,I ended up with this toddler version by a blesseded accident as I meant to get the full version for participation in the Animal Play Curriculum for our two-year old homeschool year. I could not be more pleased in the end. The rhymes are a perfect length for my toddler to repeat after me and really get some of the stories and learning new words. Currently we start the morning with a section from the Rhyme Storybook Bible and the in the afternoon (when there is a toddler version of said verses) we read along together in a repeat after me fashion in the toddler version. I love this special time with her!
4,Now for something a little different...,"What happens when a hit manga gets mugged by the director of Excel Saga and then beaten up by ADV films? You get the English version of this awesome anime! That may sound a little reversed, but the truth of the matter is, in Japanese, this anime is wonderful. I found the English voices to be grating and unfit for the characters. Another thing I had an issue with was that the background music was too loud. I couldn't really hear the dialogue that well. I feel that buying this DVD is worth it because it has the Japanese version on it as well. The art is beautiful and very true to Tomoko Hayakawa's style. I loved the manga and the anime caught me as well...The English voices needed to be thought over better, but all in all, a good anime^^"
3,For fanatics.,"First of all, this tracklist is incorrect. There's 11 songs on disc one, the missing two are ""Warm Machine"" and ""Letting The Cables Sleep"". Some of these songs are acoustic, some live, though they're all pretty good. Disc two is a DVD, and also has 11 tracks. There's a track about the ""Science Of Things"" album, one on the making of the ""Chemicals Between Us"" video, and the other tracks are again live or acoustic performances of basically the tracks on disc one. This is all good stuff, but like I said, only really for the biggest of fans. What I initially thought this might be, and what they need, is a simple 15-18 track ""Greatest Hits"". Every other grunge-era band has released one at this point, and considering that Gavin is already in a new band, why hasn't Bush given us ""6teen Hits""? All we currently have is the so-so import ""Best Of""."
1,Zero Stars,"Are bands and record lables and execs special? I mean, how difficult is it to get a complete video compilation on a dvd which holds more then enough space. Do you understand? I don't! It's like we are in resource room. Most bands simply don't care to see what drible these labels are puting out. I mean why not put all the videos on a short dvd? Because thats what fans would actually want. It's like why remaster the Beatles albums, let's wait for the baby boomers to die. I have time I'm not in my sixties, fifties, or forties. Wake up or maybe nobody cares."
2,Cheaply manufactured,These work but due to a weak soldering job the ring on the lid came off 5 seconds after we took them out of the box.
2,There's soo much better than this out there,"I have to compare this one to others out there, and vol.2 is flat. It's not terrible, but a yawner.I just bought vol. 4, it's it's head and shoulders better than this one. Skip this and buy that! :)"
5,Unce Tiss Unce Tiss Unce Tiss Unce Tiss!,"This CD arrived on specified time, the booklet however looked as if it fell on water. But the songs make up for it."
3,Only three songs in this album are trance,"This album only has like three songs that are trance. they are number 11,8,and 9."
3,Better than Vol 1,"Not awesome, but still pretty good. My favorites on here are Nightmare and Airwave. The other songs I liked were Sunchyme, Better off Alone, Toca's Miracle, I'm not in love, and Komodo. The rest I could not really get into. And also, I still don't understand, why does everyone like Castles in the Sky so much? There are better songs out there!"
4,Not bad.,"First I really didn't like this CD, but after listening to it twice, I changed my mind. It's good. Not super, not OK, just good. If you want to buy a trance CD, and you already own all the best ones, this is the one for you to buy, but otherwise there are better CDs out there."
3,Very Average,"The people who did this CD did a very mediocre job. Other than the songs ""Suncheme,"" ""Castles in the Sky,"" and ""Better off Alone"" most of the songs were just okay. There were also a few bad songs on this CD as well. If you like the songs on the CD, then buy it, but I advise you not to rush."
3,Not Bad,"Three or four tracks on this CD are my favs ... the rest are either pretty ok or so-so ... I suggest buying this used, though. The best tracks are ""It Feels So Good"", ""Cant Keep Me Silent"" and ""Airwave""."
2,I must not be a huge trance fan because,"I couldn't get into this cd at all. I thought volume one was pretty good, but the only song I liked on this one was ""nightmare"" by brainbug. I plan to give this one another chance, but it didn't make a good first impression."
2,This Is NOT The Best Of Trance,"I was given this CD as a present, thank goodness, I wouldn't spend my own money on this. None of these songs would be included in the trance genre. After I listened to this CD, I thought it would have been more appropriate to title it Club Songs from 1999. They are all great songs, they are just not trance. Buy this CD if you would like to relive your Saturday nights out dancing 3 years ago, not if you are looking for a good trance CD."
4,Screaming deal,"OK... well i spent some hours looking for the best deal on quality, water proof binocs. Very happy with these. Sharp, bright and clear... very good eye relief.My only complaints are how the neck strap attaches (low tech but secure) and the way the lens covers slip on is not very secure... more of an after thought.Really though, nice rubberized outer skin, solid construction, nice heavy nylon soft case and great price. The other thing that sold me was the Nikon 25 year no fault warranty. Waterproof too for those James Bond or outdoorsy types. %^)"
5,Amy D,I got these for my son the hunter and he loves them. He lives far away so I had then delivered right to him so he would have a present to open at Christmas. He has recommended them to his friends as well.
2,Disappontment,I purchased this with the assumption it would be similar to Road To XL but unfortunately was mistaken. The set doesn't include any extra features and basically was a waste of money.
3,"Great games, but network announcers","Any Steelers fan already knows about the games, but one important note is that the announcers on these disks are the network guys rather than Tunch and Hillgrove. Don't know why they did that, it was the local guys on the Road to XL package.If you get the Blue-ray version you can get Bill and Tunch on the Super Bowl broadcast, but that's it."
5,Super Bowl XLIII in High Definition; You can't Go Wrong!,"If you have ever watched a football game in High Definition, then you know that is the ONLY way to watch a football game. For the first time ever the NFL will release the original High Definition broadcast of Four Pittsburgh Steelers Games during this phenomenal run for their NFL Record Sixth Vince Lombardi trophy on Blu-Ray.Warner Brothers has not yet announced what special features may be included with this set, but just to be able to get one of the Best Super Bowls ever played in High Definition is well worth it alone.The fact that I am a huge Steelers Fan, only enhances my excitement for this Blu-Ray, but even if you were just a fan of football, to get a copy of the Most Watched Super Bowl of all times in High Definition, I think would be a wise investment."
3,A Bit Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to having these game in Hi-defintion. When I watched the discs, the quality was just about perfect. However, the editing was poorly done to the point that it became distracting. The huddles are edited! I think it really detracts from the viewing experience. Overall, so-so. It could have been better."
5,Solid Golf Bag,"Strong golf bag with plenty of pockets. Stand is stable/great. Last year, I purchased the Black/Blue bag and this week, I purchased the Black/Red bag."
4,"For Car Owners, Not Truck Owner","This was a great book in so many ways, the caveat being it's geared towards muscle cars and not trucks. The 3-V 5.4L engines used in trucks are are barely mentioned and there isn't a single test of them in the book. Unfortunately, that was my focus of research. I learned a great deal about the Ford modular engines in general and even stuff that would apply to the 5.4L truck engine... but, overall, I found the book more of a ""dessert"" than a ""main course."" Had I been a car guy, the reverse would have been true. Viewed in context, there is a great deal of worthwhile information in Holdener's book... especially if you need information on the various supercharger and turbocharger kits out there. The book is laid out well and the material is presented in an easy-to-digest format."
4,Great book about 4.6 performance,This book sheds light on what works and doesn't work for adding hp to your 4.6/5.4 modular. It was interesting to see how supercharged and turbocharged engines compare on the dyno when fed equal boost.
4,cost,I went to borders bookstore and they wanted over $100 for this same book. said it was a special order and out of print. attendant could not believe his eyes either!!!
2,"Shiny at first, dwindling to a dull finish....get Battlefront 2 instead!","I got this as an xmas gift after asking for Battlefront 2 (thought that counts). I debated returning it before I unwrapped it, but I'm a fan, so I figured, what the heck. How bad could a saber fighting game be? Well, after beating it in a couple hours, I have to sum it up like this... Episode III is a shameless self-promoter of the movie and little else. The game play is horribly linear (left to right) to be exact like an old NES game would have been. Definitely NOT a free-roaming environment like the Battlefront series. The graphics are OK, and the saber fighting is smooth and elegant at first, but is quickly loses it's interest after a few times playing it. The game is full of trailers for the movie which is a pain in the butt because you can't skip by them the first time through..I hate that. Anyway, long story short, it has no replayability. Once, you beat it, you pretty much have had enough. It sucks."
3,Story Mode Holding It Back,When this game first came out i was pumped and ready to buy. I at first liked it but after beeting the game in five hours saw its true colors. This game is okay only because of its multiplayer section. You can duke it out with jedi using everyhting in your arsenal. Sure its alot of fun but you can't have a game completely comprised of multiplayer.
2,Another disappointing Star Wars game,"Star Wars Battlefront now has a contender for mindless and boring Star Wars title. This game has average graphics, requires very little strategy and is way too short. A few puzzles and some ships to fly would have been nice. I wouldn't know from personal experience, but maybe games like this are better reserved for on-line play."
2,Amazon is screwing it's customers by blocking sales,"I went to attempt to sell this game like I would any other used media and received the message that amazon is blocking sales to only ""pre-approved"" sellers. Amazon is also not allowing any new ""approved"" sellers to sell this game. What this does is keep the price artificially high to buyers because games that might otherwise be sold by us independents are blocked from the market. Too bad for you the buyer. ""Approved sellers"" are raking it in with amazon's help and collusion."
3,Star Wars : Revenge Of The Sith ( PS2 ),"This is a game that was given some bad reviews, many said the graphics don't look very good and to be honest they aren't that good. But it is the gameplay that attracted me to Rvenge of The Sith. You play through story mode with Obi Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, customising your character as you go whenever you level up. The story mode features cut scenes from the film which fade in nicely and is a good touch. The two player mode is also good and allows player to duel with almost ten characters, ranging from Darth Vader to Ben Kenobi. One of the other interesting points about this game is the extra missions which allow you to play as different characters, some of which allow you to take control of General Grevious' Bodyguards and even the great Jedi Master Yoda. Overall this game is fun but could do with a little improving when it comes to graphics."
3,Good movie version but......,"Although i am a huge fan of the movies and collectibles i have to say that while this game is fun it does lack in other aspects. First off there are alot of glitches throughout the entire game, for example getting stuck in the corner and having to wait until you get shot by a super droid to be able to finally move just sucks! and where the hell is Yoda and Darth Sidious in the duel mode???????? why on earth they would put two no name Jedi's in there and not the two aforementioned characters is beyond me. Like i said, for a fan this is a good game but definitely not the best Star Wars game out there. Unfortuntely the best two are not on the Ps2. Of course i am talking about Jedi Outcast and Knights of The Old Replubic which are both on the X-box. I bought an X-box just for these titles and have to say that i will never regret it."
1,This game is not that good!,"If your looking for a good starwars lightsabre game this would be the one. Don't worry about learning about complecated controls this game is so easy to get into, but if you want a game that lasts long you would not want to get this game! Some of the lightsabre battles get to repetitive (boring). Take my advice if you want a fun and long game you would want to buy Lego Star Wars. plus you don't get to fly any vechicles."
5,The best star wars game ever,"I am not a big fan of any game that comes out of Lucas Arts, but when I saw this game reviewed on G4 and then looked at the walkthrough I just had to have it! I love the constant saber battles and just being a jedi knight good and bad all through the game. The people at Lucas Arts should be very proud of themselves. When they made this game, gamers became jedi!"
4,Repetitive... but Action-Packed!!,"Sorry about the name, it's not my account :) .I found thie game to be kind of repetitive. There are lots of combos and moves that you probably won't memorize. When you get to fight as Anakin aka Lord/Darth Vader. Graphics are solid, framerate on par. Overall, this is a game you should buy first-off. I now know wht it's a ""Greatest Hits"" game."
2,It comes from LucasArts: So it can't be good.,"If we think way, way, way back, and we think really, really, really hard, its still impossible to come up with a single good game LucasArts came out with. And, of course, this one is no exception.Lets begin with the fact that this game is HORRIBLE. Its a button mashers dream, so it does not take any skill to complete. Its repeditive triangle, square, R1, triangle, circle, and any other button that does anything. This is one of those games that the only way to do anything cool or entertaining is to memorize a long list of special moves.Fighting jedis in this game was a nightmare. It was simple and boring. To begin with, took about fifty hits to kill the other jedi. Hmmmm. And, on top of that, you could basically hold down the block button and not get hit, unless the other jedi did a SPECIAL move (oooooo) and knocked you down.Revenge of the Sith is a linear and one deminsional game. NOT FUN. STAY AWAY."
1,Disappointed,"I got the game with the mail, i wasn't expecting it so early which was a major plus. I cracked a monster and began playing, the levels are easy but have difficult moments, about half through the game i'm guessing, as i have seen the movie and around the time anakin becomes a sith there isn't much left of the story, the game got a bit glitchy, not a huge deal, it wasn't until it completely froze end level that i began to worry, the disk isnt scratched, so i reloaded it played through the level again and it froze again, and again at the same spot, i have only had this problem with buffed games, which again not a huge deal didn't pay much for half of a game...just wish it would have mentioned this in the reveiw that the games have been mechanically cleaned"
2,"Cheap, rushed movie tie-in garbage!",I am very sorry that I spent any money at all on this game. The production quality is bad and the gameplay itself is sloppy and boring. Feels like it was rushed to market. I couldn't even be bothered with it after the 2nd level. One of the lamest games I have planned in years! Avoid at all cost!!!
4,horrible,this is horrible (like walmart)because you play as the coolest character general grievious. buy now!!!!
2,>_<,"Three words can decribe this game: short, repetitive (same things over and over), and a button-masher. Its bad. OK? Its 99% bad. The other 1% is good, only cause you can play ONE mission as Grievous."
2,Star Wars: A New Hype,"this game is basically all hype. everyone has been dying for a game with lightsaber action and we finally get one, the problem is that this game is mindless and short. my 10 year old brother beat it in 1 day. not to say it's a bad game, where it shines, it shines. the lightsaber play is awesome, the force abilities are awesome, but c'mon, the game is so short and is so simple. i guess that reenacts the movie well where you can rarely die. the problem there lies with not being enough of a challenge. i think lego star wars proved more difficult than this. it's a great game to rent, but it is not worth the 50-60 dollars that you would shell out for a purchase. i'd buy this game if it was a greatest hits, not right now."
5,AWESOME!!!,THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!! I LOVE IT!!! NOT ONLY DOES IT HAVE THE STORY MODE BUT IT HAS BONUS MISSIONS AND VERSUS MODE WHERE YOU PICK A JEDI OR A SITH LORD AND DUEL!!! IT IS GREAT!!!
3,I'm going to keep this short,The game is really fun in the begining but as you progress it is just boring..I beat it in one day. for the next star wars game they should cover all of the episodes...that would be the ultimate game!!!
3,Good for a movie conversion...,"The graphics are good.Sound is good.Gameplay; good but gets VERY repeditive.The camera is very poor and sloppy at times. eg. The times where you cut open power boxes. Sometimes you can't find them!The game is pretty hard after a while.The acting in-game is poor.I rented this game for one-night and beat it that evening. It took me under 7 hours.Overall, no matter how kidish LEGO Star Wars looks, give it a try before getting this game. If your looking for official merchandice from Episode 3, you shound rent before buying..."
2,A Waste Of Time,"Personally I don't like to say anything bad about anything, but this is an exception.In the year of 2005, I remember reading a magazine and saw the preview of this game and thought good graphics, copying Lord Of The Rings: Return Of The King game, but thought worth getting.I got this game and I completed this game in two days and I was horribly disappointed. The single player mode was easy except for two levels and the multiplayer could have been good if they had made it like The Lord Of The Rings game for Co-Op mode and Vs mode was good, but you can get bored.So I recommend not getting this game.Jake Potts"
4,T is too high a rating,T is way too high a rating. It should be rated E-10. But besides that its a good game. 4 stars at least!
5,Awesome game,"This game is awesome! I love playing as anakin, obi-wan is cool also. The best part is killing the separtists on mustafar as anakin, aka darth vader. The one downfall is that it is short, I bought it today and I have almost beat it. All together an awesome game with awesome graphics and also it uses real voice actors from the movies."
5,Fantastic Game,"This game is by far the best Star Wars game for PS2 yet. The levels are simply gorgous and the lightsaber duels are smooth with plenty of combo moves. It has cutscenes and the soundtrack from the movie. You can play as Kenobi or Anakin, and in the bonus missions as General Grievous, Darth Vader, and YODA!!! That is the most fun I've ever had in such a short amount of time. The game also includes an alternate ending if you can unlock it. I won't spoil it for you, but the name of it is ""The Final Revenge of the Sith."" If you are a Star Wars fan of any age, I highly recommend this game. If you don't mind spoilers that is."
4,"SAWEEEET!!!!, but short. 14 LEVELS!!!!!!!!",If you liked the lord of the rings games you will like this. If you don't like the lord of rings games you will still love it.
4,"Short, but fun.....","Okay, I give it to the people who have already rated this game, I honestly expected the game to be a bit longer. BUT, I still think the game is fun. If you love Star Wars, you'll love the game, and it'll be worth the 50 bucks to own the game.However, if you're just an so-so fan, you might want to either rent or buy used......"
2,"good, but to short!!!!! rent it","this is a good game , but u can beat it in 1hr! I think this game is a rental!!!!! So if u want a good star war game , this is not it"
2,"Is this a stealth ""pro-life"" flick?","Nine couples have sex. Nine couples get pregnant. Nine couples have babies. Nine couples live happily ever after. What are the odds? And not a flicker of doubt amongst the bunch! The happy parents-to-be include a pair of high school kids, another couple who otherwise would have (should have) broken up if not for the blessed news, and a cougar mom having a mid-life fling with some kid. Yikes. I'm tempted to think that all the R-rated hijinks were an underhanded attempt to advance some sort of anti-choice message. Nevertheless, it's a pretty awful flick no matter which side of the fence you fall."
1,Cliche After Cliche,The characters in this film are so stereotypically unlikeable the movie is actually painful to watch. It's a shame with such a great cast but nearly every female is portrayed as bitchy and suspicious while nearly every guy is sexually motivated and incapabable of emoting.
2,Disappointing rehash.,Every season gets progressively worst. This was a very disappointing season. Another tragedy that hits everyone. This is getting old quick.
3,Grey's Anatomy Season 8 DVD set,"While Amazon.com is wonderful about returns, I am now in the process of returning my second Grey's Anatomy Season 8 DVD set because of damaged DVDs. It is disappointing to be in the middle of watching a tv series and be unable to play an entire DVD, all of an episode, or chunks of various episodes, because of damaged DVDs. The quality of the DVDs is what bothers me. Amazon.com is one of my favorite sites for online shopping because their policies are so good. I'm just disappointed that I have to wait another week or 10 days to receive the third replacement set of DVDs. One thing I learned since my last return...don't rush to return the damaged set until you have watched ALL of the replacement set. I could have swapped out DVDs and possibly have had one completely good set between the two. This time I will wait to return the damaged set until I am sure all the replacement DVDs work. Amazon gives you 30 days to return the damaged item without charge."
5,Grey's lover for Life!!,"I own all of the Grey's Anatomy DVDs. I've been watching since Season 1. I love the medical accuracy, the characters, and plot. Shonda Rhimes is a great writer. I am now equally addicted to her new show, Scandal. Anxious for next season...extremely discontent with Lexie leaving the show, but I will still watch."
5,Better and Better,"The show gets better and better every season. Watch the show from Season One to understand the history, each episode builds on previous episodes. It will be money well spent."
2,scratched,I don't know what happen but for a brand new movie one of the disc was scratched bad and it would freeze so I would have to skip a whole scene due to it would not play
5,Keeps Getting Better,"First of all, if you're not addicted to Grey's already, it's time for you to get that way.Go watch all of the previous seasons. They're on Amazon Instant or Netflix.You'll have plenty of time to catch up before this September release.If you like love, friendship, heart-warming and heart-breaking stories with drama here and they're, it's for you.This season is full of all those elements that make Grey's, Grey's. Along with fighting to save each and every unique patient that steps through Seattle Grace's doors, the residents (towards the end of the season) are stressfully fighting to pass their boards. When all seems well and good, it was time for the season's end.And it sure ended with a bang.Your favorite doctors are put in a traumatic situation unlike their everyday trauma.Their plane crashes. They are the victims. They are holding on for dear life.Just like every season, we'll all be waiting on pins and needles to finish this cliffhanger.Worth the wait. Only a few more months."
3,good quality,"I did not realize I ordered them so far ahead of production, I like the show, I caught up on the show, would order again from this vendor."
5,Shockingly awesome!,This season's finale was as gripping as a Hitchcock movie. I can hardly wait to see what happens in Season 9.
5,Favorite Series,"This season in the series had more surprises than I expected. Since the writer, Shonda, has tried to come up with new shows and they have bombed, I am surprised that she could keep the surprises and shocks coming on this one, but she did. Can't wait to see what the new season brings and hope she can keep these people happy with their show!"
4,Love this show!,"I do really like the show, but I think that Season 9 might be the end of Grey's. The story lines, while enjoyable, are getting a little ridiculous. Still love it though."
5,best tv series,"great series can`t wait for the 9th series to come out after watching this one.you become involved with the people and the running of the hospital,"
5,Can't stop loving this series,In love with this series. Can't wait for season 9 to be releasedIs there will be season 10 also?
5,Grey's anatomy series,This was a Christmas gift that the Girls wanted and so far they have enjoyed it very much. Thanks you so much.
5,Was well worth money,Was well worth money! I did not have to wait to watch episodes online in between commercials. It was great to get caught up before this season started :)
4,MUST SEE - Way better having a season in one go.,These were great withthe last episode throwing in a twist of what will happen next season...who will be in next season.
5,The best TV series,I was totally happy with my purchase of Gray's Anatomy season 8. It arrived as expected. It's has to be my favorite series.
1,Very upsetting(dont buy used anything),"Nearly every disk skipped, and I missed whole portions of the show. I was very upset. Not worth it at all. DO Not order used anything on DVD!"
4,Eight Season,I didn't like this season too much. If Patrick Dempsey were not in it I probably wouldn't watch it at all. I hated it when they killed off Mark and Lexie that was just wrong on so many levels.
5,An Beautiful and Fun Retrospective,"Artie Shaw is a genius. That fact is obvious from this recording. First, the music on these cd's is wonderful. But I loved this set most because it shows the full range of Mr. Shaw's talent and creative thinking. Some of the cuts are not my cup of tea but then this is a five cd set. Nevertheless, each selection which Mr. Shaw chose is there so that we can understand his evolution...his story. For example, there are four versions of Stardust: His big hit from ca. 1939 and another very different and wide open arrangement from a 1938 radio show, and then another by his amazing 1949 band, and finally one by the Grammercy Five recorded in the 1950's. They are all great. These cuts and all of the rest tell an interesting and beautiful musical story. This is especially true when Mr. Shaw's lucid commentary is read along with one's listening. This collection is expensive but well worth it."
3,one piece chipped. poorly packed. Disappointed!,One dish chipped. Could have been packed better inside china box.Do not know what to do. Very disappointed. Want a replacement of dish!
4,Really helped,I had a period of time where I could not seem to shut out the day and sleep. A physical therapist recommended this as a possible solution. It worked and now I pull out this CD whenever I cannot drift off.
3,Post-apocalyptic movie isn&#65533;t bad.,"It's been quite a while since I've seen this film, but surprisingly I remember it pretty well. I'm a fan of this genre, so this film, along Costner's work and one of Gibson's ""Mad Max"" stories, I do enjoy (at certain times). Even Patrick Swayze's ""Steel Dawn"" has many things that I liked.While none of these films are 5-star material, they do well to fill in the blank/bland spots in ones' day or evening. Surprisingly, ""The Ultimate Warrior"" ended up being pretty darn good (related to others of the genre).If you're hunting and pecking to find a film that you haven't seen (and like this genre), try it out. I certainly won't guarantee that you'll like it, but heck, two bucks for a rental won't kill ya. Between 1 and 10, I give ""The Ultimate Warrior"" a solid 6 (a rating within the genre--I'd be hard pressed giving anything more than a marginal 5 otherwise)."
4,Ultimate Warrior,Just a note to all out there that I picked up a copy at Best Buy this week on a double disk Science Fiction Collection. Its out there and a pretty cool movie. Wonder why not available on Amazon.
3,Brynner is Coooooooooooool.,I picked up this movie on VHS and hadn't seen it since I was a kid. I must say that I still like the movie. Some of that may be a nostalgia thing and some of it is simply because of Yul Brynner being super cool and also William Smith as the menacing villian. Max Von Sydow is also one of my favorite actors. But I must say this movie looks like an early 70's made for TV movie. The settings look really fake and like they are on the studio lot and a stock city setting. Some of the acting is also just horrible. But the top three guys make it worth watching and if you are a fan of this time period and this genre I think you will like this film.
4,Tonight on the C.B.S. latenight movie part 3,"This is one of those movies that ran on a regular time table back in the day. I have looked for it on DVD and other than an old video copy(in the big clam shell case that was Warner bros. trademark in the 80's) and found that very little was cut from the version I saw as a kid.Brynner is the whole show here,so if you like him that's a plus for the movie,but the kiss of death for those who don't like him. Here he's a warrior in the 2012 world of New York. The planet has faced plauge and neglect til nothing will grow. One group of people,with Max von Sydow as it's leader has found some seeds that are growing and want to get away from the city to grow them. Enter Brynner, as a warrior hired to take them there and protect them from the bad gangs.Not very ""ultimate"" but still good fun for the over 35 crowd and those who love Yul Brynner!"
3,Brynner is good but not at his best.,"To appreciate this film I believe you have to consider the time it was released. During the mid 1970's the cold war was looming over the U.S. and somehow a film like this seemed almost possible. Viewing it now in the year 2000 viewers will realize they are living in what this film indicates will be a post nuclear war environment. Obviously the events in this movie never materialized, thank heavens. Cadillac's are still being produced. Although unlike the mid 70' when people purchased then they are now leased.This film is good because for those of us who lived with the fear of nuclear war it reminds of us of how we as a nation worried about some things other than how long this bull run in the stock market will last."
5,"Intelligent, wide-ranging, sensible, and fascinating.","This is the best book I have ever read. I've read it at least four times by now. It came at a good time for me, because I was starting to wonder why hundreds of years of financial management experience had left us with governments chronically short of money, and with institutions that have survived centuries of war and weather being destroyed by modern management techniques. If these guys are so smart, how come everything is falling apart? And why won't they accept reponsibility for their failures? After I read Voltaire's Bastards, I understood. This is a book that you will not want to lend out - you will feel disarmed without it."
1,The worst book I have ever read,"Yes, it was *that* bad. In a confusing, opinionated and poorly substantiated argument, Saul's comments/theories have holes so big you could drive a truck through them. Over hundreds of years of history he draws upon a very select group of examples to make his point. That point being something about rational thinking bringing modern society undone. I think Mr Saul should read a book called 'How We Know What Isn't So - the fallibility of human reason in everyday life'. Saul has obviously come up with an idea and then trauled through the history of man looking for examples to back up that idea. I'm sure that i could find examples of absolutely anything I wanted to given a big enough population and time scale to draw my data from. Saul's book is as erroneous as it is tedious to read. Definitely don't bother with this one."
1,I'm over 13,"How absurd!And from the opening page it is absurd.This presumptuous intellectual who cut no knowledge stands to rebuke a towering light that pointed the way out from Semitic superstition.When we see medieval pictures of animals hanging from trees apparently this had nothing to do with religion and all to do with philosophy.I THINK NOT.This book is a prime example of a stupid idea that sits on a false premise.Modern physics also is full of absurd abstractions.But what is the truth?The truth in justice hands sits in logic and Voltaire lead people out away from the absurdity of the wishful thinking of humanity in the love of universal justice in feelings , which changes every day.Not even a family can be run on such hopefulness.A turgid load of nonsense.Marx would revere-but I'm not confused.The state promotes this as a remedy for clear though-Its cancer for an ordered society.T"
3,A strong message lost.,"Saul's book delivers many an interesting observation about the state of man and the way we rule our societies. Unfortunately, his messages are often lost in an unending series of examples that convinced me more of his desperate need to 'name drop' and indulge his knowledge of historical figures than to drive his arguments home. This, coupled with his inability to offer alternatives (anyone can point out the system's flaws, but few can offer solutions) and refusal to acknowledge counter-arguments, left me with the impression that I had simply read the words of another, clever observer. And our university systems are already overflowing with these."
5,The horrible truth is out there...,"and John Ralston Saul has hit the nail on the head. This has been the most important book that I have ever read. Exhaustively researched and wonderfully argued, Saul made it clear to me why I have, for my entire life, felt uneasy about our civilization. Prepare to have all that you have assumed as truth to be shattered before your eyes. Also prepare to feel freed by a man who tells you about things that you already somehow knew."
5,"truly ""a hand grenade disguised as a book""!","If you want to understand the world we live, then read this book. It's message is liberating. It is totally on the mark. It was published in 1992, but it fully explains everything that has happened since then. The author is brilliant. It's a citizen's survival guide to the 21st century. The book is very dense so don't expect a lazy, breezy read."
3,Another female singer/songwriter...,Another female singer/songwriter in a field of thousands is better than 80% of what's out there but 20% of thousands is still a lot to compete with. Maybe being Diana Ross' stepdaughter will help her stand out from the pack...plus she's pretty cute.
4,Improvement from her debut,"'I tried to rock you...' is an improvement from 'Comatised', her debut record. The writing comes out as more mature, yet is a lot simpler and 'happier', there are catchy choruses and riffs throughout the whole album -- and that is a good thing! These are not mindless pop tunes, but something with heart and brains to it. Also, she departs from her mostly acoustic compositions from 'Comatised' to explore a more electric groove this time around.""Mexico"", ""Mayor of your town"" and the title track are probably the better songs from this release, but most of it is fairly consistent in quality.Not quite there yet, but 'I tried to rock you...' is a step in the right direction."
5,Like a ray of sunshine coming through your speakers.,"I really love this album, i'm not really into pop music but this is a really amazing and rare exception to the norm (Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson, ect.). Leona Naess is like a breath of fresh air, she's like a cross between Fiona Apple and Sheryl Crow. There is not a single bad track on this album, you can listen to it straight through. This Cd hasen't left my player since I bought it. I just hope she keeps on making music like this."
4,I knew this is a great CD!!,"I can't wait to get this CD and I've been looking for it for almost a month now since its release. I've search in every music stores but they still don't have it here.But anyway, from her previous album ""Comatised"", I can say that this follow-up album is fantastic and much better.I love Leona's voice and her music and her lyrics so much, her CD cover is really amazing."
3,A reasonably good sophomore CD from Leona,"(3 and 1/2 stars) Leona's return is a more mature and absorbing album than her occasionally brilliant but spotty debut CD. Rolling Stone recently described her music as modern-day Blondie, which is not bad comparison, especially given her quasi-rapping on some of the songs and a bent for synthesized Euro-disco on ""All The Stars"" and ""Boys Like You."" Her breathy-sexy delivery also made me think of Nena, the '80s German singer responsible for ""99 Luftballoons."" (Sorry for the obscure reference.) In any case, the album is a well-produced blend of solid indie-pop that's easy to listen to, especially tunes such as ""Mexico"" and ""Sunny Sunday."""
4,More splendid work from Mark Hatmaker,"Very good book.In it are covered some basic and advanced wrestling and submission takedown techniques. A lot of photos which make all techniques easy to understand, there is not a lot of text but photos do the job, that reader will undersatand what is going on.Like all Hatmakers books this is not be missed. It makes great collection on MMA books.Why not all 5 stars: because I wanted to see more takedowns in it, specialy from Greco Roman side of wrestling. But that's just my wish and author make his call what he will cover n there."
5,very good book again and again,mark hatmaker did it again. another very good book on NHB. mark is a credible author who can share his knowledge easily and practical. a 5 star rating was given for a very good author and NHB practitioner. hoping for more books to come
3,No more peace,This is actually a great card... amazing resolution and 3d... great support from ati.The reason I rated 3 is because it's a real headache to me... simply put : THE FAN ON THIS IS UNBEARABLE... i feel I own a 1988 PC all of a sudden.If you can bear the sound.. go for this card...If you are like me and you want to enjoy a peaceful quite room... don't even think about this card. This is the noisiest device I have ever owned. Even noisier than my apple external SCSI drive (which is really loud)
3,Insightful,Shows the reader how some hedge funds look and measure risk. A lot of finance lingo and very complicated material.. If you want a view of how some hedge fund guys look at their portfolio....I would pick this book up...However if you are wanting to pick up a book that's easily under-stable I would stay away. Overall a very interesting book for anyone serious about starting up a hedge fund...However be ready to spend a good time figuring out some formulas for those math deficient.
1,A waste of time..and money,"How can a risk manager in a hedge fund know so little about risk management? This book is the most simplistic -in the negative sense of the term- risk management book i have ever come accross. Unless you don't even know the most basic theories of risk management, do not waste you time reading this book. The most innovatice and only technical insight in this book is : 1 + 1 = 1.41, said differently: ""don't put your eggs in the same basket"". My grandma knew it already...and she died before hedge funds existed.As for the transparency issue, no solutions are offered...just questions with no critical approach."
4,Robi Rocks,"Robi rocks on this cd! ""Do It Twice"" is such a catchy tune and the mix of Hawaiian styles with Bob Marley's lyrics is a match made in heaven! There is such versatility on this album from a Stevie Nicks song (Landslide) to a Tracy Chapman song (Give Me One Reason) to Ku Kahakalau's numerous songs. We have a myriad of languages as well - Hawaiian, English, Tahitian, and French. Hapa Haole Hula Girl is a fitting tribute to her father and has a tune that will make you dance all the day long!"
5,Robi-All I want...,"I just discovered Robi's music a short while ago, and was delighted to find her CD's on Amazon.I am very happy with the album, and with the vendor's prompt delivery."
1,Author proves that defending smoking is impossible,"Author may fool some gullible readers or those who desparately want to fool themselves. In the section that discusses smokers' deaths from lung cancer, Oakley says the risk isn't too bad because the death rate from lung cancer is only 0.16%. What he neglects to state is that this is the yearly death rate. The risk for a lifetime of smoking is much higher."
1,Twisted analyses by a non-scientist,It is quite evident that the author apparently has no education or training in the medical sciences nor in epidemiology. But that doesn't stop him from manipulating peer-reviewed published scientific work to satisfy his denial as a long time smoker. This book is quite a rant.
1,"Long on fiction, short on facts","I wouldn't be surprised if the tobacco industry commissioned this work. It wouldn't be the first time. In fact, some (most)of the reports cited that exonerate smoking, even the ""scientific"" ones, were produced with the generous funding and blessing of the industry. The public is unaware of these numerous unpublished reports, saying smoking is not harmful, simply because these claims will not hold water.Keeping the controversy alive is one of the industry's schemes to create and maintain doubt in people's minds regarding the obvious ill health effects of smoking. But they'll use ""independent"" minds and organizations as their mouthpiece."
1,Total crap,Looks like some nutjob's prison scrawls from when he was doing time for domestic terrorism. Just a total waste of money.
2,not much you can't look up your self,giveing it two star's. it just not what i was looking for. most give's you a base but not lot detell! and some of what's in the book. can get you hrut! not a good buy. most for it is out of date. and you can look it up for free on the web.
2,Scary,"I received this book and quickly started an interesting read. It starts with a very specific warning to read the whole book, and don't start messing around with some of the things explained until you HAVE read the whole thing. I agree.I think I expected a different content. you get detailed explanations about how to make many weapons; pyrotechnic, guns, poison etc. etc.I guess I thought this book was a manual of how to do constructive, positive/fun things. What I got was a detailed manual how to be an assassin, or social deviant/anarchist. I didn't like it, and wish I could strike it from my ""items bought"" list!I'll sell it to you if you want it.Enjoy"
3,eh,I bought the book because i like having info that few others do and the book is somewhat disapointing. 60% of the book is terrible photocopy from a fireworks manufacturer or something and the rest is dicey at best.
3,Take what you can get.,"This book was given to me as a present years back and I have read through it many times. To be honest the only things I have ever found to be worth anything is the Poor Mans Armorer, and the Improvised Munitions Handbook, the latter a being size in its original field manual though. The Chemicals in War and Chemistry of Powder and Explosives are both interesting reads but I found little value in either. To be honest I would not recommend this book unless you are willing to feel a bit cheated."
2,Disappointed,This is an interesting book if you are maybe 12 years old. I would guess that most people who have made it past puberty would probably see this book as juvenile and a waste of money and time. The photos appear to be the result of many generations of photocopying. Looks like something a kid would throw together for a school project. I thought this book was really going to contain some radical stuff but it turned out to be a real disappointment.
5,knowledge is power and this is powerful knowledge!,"This is the most information packed book I have ever read! After reading this book, I understood the value of knowledge. This book teaches chemistry in a way that you can use and is easy to Understand. If a small percent of any nation's people knew this material, their government would never become a tyrant and other nations would be afraid to invade. This is powerful knoledge that can save your life (or get you killed)! Be sure to read all of it before begining any mixing of chemicals. He gives must know safety information with each chemical or project.Now the bad news: After reading this book, TV and movies will never be the same! All the BS they use becomes easy to spot and it ruins the movie! It becomes obvious that the script writer is woefully ignorant and you are not! Their movie will quickly become childish or seem stupid to you. Want to realy know something of value? Then study this book!"
4,This book is informative and touching for children of all ag,As a third grade teacher I use this book on a yearly basis during the month of January. Davidson does a wonderful job of allowing the children to connect to young Martin. From the early chapters she eloquently weaves Martin's words along with those of his friends and colleagues. Children are certainly saddened when Martin is eventually killed. Well worth reading!
4,Zimmer 483,"ALthough the vocal changed hugely in his voice,teenager-adolesence. i guess firstly you would feel weired, listening to the songs like hes someone else.but after all, its a good collection of good music. I luv the lyrics, like the lyrics going well with the music. and becuz of them, i now getting intereted to back learning my German...=_=Tokio Hotel could go larger, despite the rest, they can Thru the Monson!"
1,tokio hotel zimmer,"i never recieved the product, it was supposed to be recieved by the 25th and today is the 4th of April and the cd has still not been recieved"
5,Teenie-germans rule!,"Great music, just loads of fun! For those of you who do not know: the german chancellor herself thanked these guys for getting European kids interested in German as a second or third language option at school...I teach German at a school in rural South Africa and I must admit: Tokio Hotel is hot, fresh, weird and makes learning German words and accents real fun. Besides that - I like it as much as the children do (and I'm 33!)Watch out world - these guys will go international in a big way. This album is just the beginning."
5,Makes you want to learn German,"This album is alot more mature than ""Schrei!""; Bill's voice sounds great. I've listened to it so many times since I bought it. I simply LOVE it. I don't speak German but TH has inspired me to learn. You should REALLY buy this album."
1,The worst book ai have ever read,"Vogel's biography is nor worthy of the the term or its subject. it is poorly researched (she relies on fan magazines!), poorly edited, and is written in the breathless style of a teen-aged girl. Vogel seems to have no real understanding of Gene Tierney and has turned out a hack piece of writing that is shamefully overpriced. Bonnie Cousineau from Cape Neddick, Maine"
4,Enjoyed it but wanted more info,"I love a lt of Gen Tierney's movies and was interested in finding out more about her personal life.It was enjoyable to read, but a lot of info & story parts were repeated throughout the book. I guess I was hoping for more."
4,"""Unluckiest luckiest girl in the world""",I enjoy Ms. Tierney's movies and it was very interesting to read about the events in her life. Now I understand why she stopped making movies. Definitely a book for her fans.
3,Not the originals,"Now here's a lesson for everyone, if it is a major artist like Kitty Wells or Jack Greene, and the record label is ""Step One,"" then it's a re-recording. Usually cheaply made.This one has it's plusses tho, it is a re-recording, but this effort was kind of inspired. It doesn't try to copy the original arrangements note for note. For instance, ""It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels"" has been redone as an upbeat shuffle.While I dont recomend this recording, simply because it is an intended ripoff, it is a cool recording for big fans."
5,Introduction to American Music,"Rounder Records has always done an incredible job of putting together compilations and making the music sound alive. This collection celebrates 30 years of Rounder, and is a great overview of the label, as well as a taster for anyone looking to check out some truly alternative music. The mixture is very eclectic; much like American culture, blending and weaving through musical styles. The set features Blues, Folk, Cajun, Bluegrass, Celtic and much more.A highly recommended listening experience."
5,Unforgetable Boleros.,"If you are of a romantic nature, you will so enjoy these boleros. This CD is packed with absolutely WUNderful Boleros!"
4,Dance Crazy!,There are some great dance tunes on this disc. The lead singer's voice is soulful; lyrics are deep and wonderful. Stop and listen to the words if you can stop tapping your toes. I love these guys. When are they coming to your town? When is their next album release?
1,Source of frustration,"My daughter, in trying to increase her SAT math score, became extremely discouraged as we figured out that there were incorrect problems in the first math test! Now that we cannot trust the book, we will look for practice tests elsewhere."
1,Only good as kindling,"This has to be the biggest piece of garbage ""study guide"" that has ever been authored. Rife with errors and incorrect ""answers"", and teaming with simple minded arrogance found in the back of book under ""solutions"" show a fundamental knowledge gap between the subject and the author(s). Simple arithmetic and logical problems are contained throughout the text, including questions that cannot be reasoned out even when you have the ""solution"". This book will break your brain into thinking in functionally retarded state as you grasp at straws to determine how they got yet ANOTHER problem/solution TOTALLY WRONG. BUYER BEWARE![...] If you need to wipe, there are surely books Amazon sells with a higher thread count.. I can't even recommend it for that. Worse than a bad prep book, it's a ""How to do it wrong and look like a moron in front of friends and colleagues"" book. At that sole and only task, it excels."
5,Extraordinary,"I would guess that the person who wrote the above review hasn't actually SEEN Nina Berman's extraordinary book of photographs. If she had, I doubt that she would have questioned Ms. Berman's utmost respect for the injured American soldiers returning from Iraq. The public has been unnecessarily shielded from seeing the result of this war: mangled bodies, amputated limbs, shock and sorrow on the faces of those brave souls who have been sent to fight. Berman's images, as well as the soldier's own words, are difficult to take in. Yet, I was surprised to read that a good number of those profiled in the book are very proud of their service and regret having to leave the armed forces. One soldier even says it was the best experience of his life; the picture shows him with one leg. I think it is inaccurate to suggest that Berman doesn't understand these soldier's courage and patriotism. She does, indeed. And she has the pictures to prove it."
4,What a bargain!,"Scenic and educational, and a boon to students wrestling with mythology and ancient history. Extensive bonus footage makes this an exceptional bargain."
2,A fly over,"If your idea of seeing Greece is flying over it in a helicopter, this DVD is for you. Frankly I hoped for something more. To be sure, the scenery is beautiful--albeit from afar. But travel posters show that much. It would have been nice, however, to see places at eye level, up close and to meet the people.The narration is a bit superficial and not always easy to understand because of the accent, especailly with the intrusive background music. A view of the Acroposis doesn't really need violins or pianos to punch it up a little.Surely there is a better travelogue of Greece than this. I'll keep looking for it."
3,Visions of Greece,"The video has beautiful photography of Greece. I was a bit disappointed that the ports our cruiseship will visit were not included. However, it is a very good product and I would recommend it."
2,Music is OK...Sound is awful!,I see that this CD has been remastered. It either was in terrible shape to start with or a terrible job was done. The sound quality makes it hardly listenable. After hearing the Teagarden cut on the Johnny Mercer Songbook I eagerly looked forward to this album. I was very disapointed.
5,BEST SINGLE OF THE NEW CENTURY,"A CUT AND PASTE GEM FROM AUSTRALIA. COMBINES HUMOR WITH GREAT MUSIC. BEST USE OF SAMPLES I HAVE EVER HEARD. DETROIT RADIO STATIONS ARE AFRAID TO PLAY ANYTHING THIS WILD, SO I HAD TO HEAR IT ON ""ACID JAZZ"" DIGITAL TV. SUPREME MASTERS OF THE SAMPLER. LETS HOPE THEY RELEASE THE ALBUM STATESIDE."
4,works great... breaks easily,"I've always thought it was a great idea, and it is. The problem is the cap loosens up and you have to tighten the screw occasionally. tighten it too hard and it snaps off. You could replace the screw with a nut and bolt, or if yours breaks, return it for a replacement. It really is a fantastic way to wash the third floor. Highly recommended."
2,Seems like a good idea... but,"I have bought several CH products and this is the first (in my opinion) ""Dud."" The tank becomes very heavy when filled with soap and it is very cumbersome to use when trying to aim up or down. A lot more trouble that what it was worth. Tank becomes slippery to hold in place when you have soap and water on your hands."
3,lenses cover wheel keeps falling,I like the binoculars and would have rated them higher but the enclosed documentation was for a different model. Took me two hours to track down the correct docs.Minor issue is that the wheel provided for calculating range keeps falling out of the lenses cover. Try to do both is too much.
5,Amazing!,"Very good Binocs to take with u on a vacation. Light weight, good zoom, comes with the cover. Good for bird/wild life watching..."
2,"Quick, easy, but not very good","I ordered one because I switch back and forth between TV, so as not to dominate the HD. I have two 360s, the first I use a RF modulator. I tried this on the second- easy and quick, running out of elec. sockets to plug into,etc.. Unfortunately, the quality of the picture is much lower than using a RF modulator where you plug your 3 wire in and the use coaxial from Modulator to TV. The pictuer is like using rabbit ears for UHF channels. Spend an add'l 10 to 15 buck for the modulator for a much better icture."
1,don't bother with it.,"this thing worked perfectly fine for me.... the first time.......after that, this P.O.S. was giving me a black and white picture with static for sound."
3,"It does the job, just not always very well","my tv has a/v outputs on the front and when the audio port crapped out on me, the RF adapter was my only solution short of buying a new tv. it did work fine for quite a while. but it wouldn't always make a good connection so if i watched tv, it was always kind of fuzzy. playing games though, it was perfect. until about 3 or 4 months later when it slowly sort of died on me. so overall, not too bad, especially for the price."
4,Makes Game Play Easy.,"This is a nifty little product. It replaces your audio/video plugs and makes game play easier. My TV has A/V outputs in the front and back and my front output doesn't work so anytime I wanted to play with the 360 or watch a DVd, I would have to unplug my cable plugs in the back and replace it with the 360 A/V cables. It got annoying.With the RF adapter, the need for that is gone. A/V cables are no longer needed. Just plug this into your antenna output and you are good to go. Just switch from Video 1 to Channel 3 anytime you want to use your XBO X360.Great product for a great price."
2,Not very sturdy,"This product is poorly constructed with a single""hook"" latching mechanism. This hook is very easilybroken. Also, it really doesn't hold the bars still;they can still move! I've found that a simple bungeecord works best, anyhow."
1,"Great idea, poor execution...","I agree with Cjnk, very poorly made. Mostly constructed of plastic, which makes easily breakable and not something you can throw around in the shop. Same problems with the rubber strap and it's catch hook. The slots on the strap are 90 degrees off ( | vs. - ) so they do not line up with the catch hook. You have to stretch the rubber strap to force it on the catch hook. Which leads me to the next problem... the strap broke. Any amount of stretching and it will eventually crack and break. A little manufacturing Q.A. testing would have caught this. Another issue with the strap is it is too thick to go under the exposed brake cable under my bike's top tube. Therefore, you have to wrap them around your brake cable. So you're not able to replace, adjust, etc. my rear brake with it installed. If you have the Topeak Handlebar Stabilizer, try replacing the rubber strap with a Velcro strap. This solved most of my problems."
1,Topeka Handlebar Stabilizer-Waste of time & $,I am a big fan of Topeka products. I have a few and they have made my life considerably easier. The Topeka Handlebar holder is a great idea. But it is constructed poorly and the materials are inferior. The catch hook is shaped incorrectly. The unit broke the first time I used it. Save yourself $25 dollars and go to Home Depot and buy a $3 roll of plumbers tape. You will accomplish the same thing.
4,mixed thoughts,"Being just an `average' 'Tudor period' keyboardist I can play 3, maybe 4, songs in this book. That beats the kids who can play 1, [kinda]. ... no-one I know can `batter' more than 5. Worthwhile if you like to `follow' CDs, and I do, but most folks will get so discouraged by trying to play this music they would have to look up to see a lizard's belly ... the Rodgers Virginal Book, also by Dover, is a whole lot more realistic to play music from ... oh, it is not the `high falooten' stuff in this but it doesn't drive one to strong drink in the knots of frustration as fast, either."
1,SCREW THIS!,I can't belive they would put this blasphemy on dvd! This is a load of malarke i say! A boatload!!!-VOTE FOR PEDRO!
3,"Not the best cast for ""The New Class""","This is probably the worst cast on ""The New Class"".Each character is a direct knockoff of an original SBTB cast member.There is a Screech knockoff,a Zack knockoff,a Kelly knockoff,A pseudo Slater knockoff,a pseudo Jessie knockoff,and Lisa knockoff(kind of).Mr.Belding's still here to give you the Bayside feel.I recommend picking this up If you liked the original series.Enjoy!"
3,Image Ent losses a star for quality,"The New Class series is what it is, not much Image can do about that. But they could at least release a complete good quality series in DVD. Allmost all the episodes were good except one which looked like someone downloaded a mpeg file of the show and burned a VCD out of it. And for that I give this DVD 3 out of a possible 4 stars they could've got from me. With that being said, if your a big fan of the SBTB francise, I would still recomend this set. For all of you fans or the original SBTB, season 5 drops on July 26."
1,No Thanks,"They shouldn't have remade the show with knockoffs and unoriginal characters...i remember being excited about a new saved the bell, i'll just say it wasn't worth watching on tv and not worth buying, unless you are just a die hard fan of SBTB and series like it..."
5,a must have for msg fans,"this is probably michael schenkers finest work outside of ufo.the album is tight, from the first track to the last, including the bonus tracks.michaels choise of backing musicians,couldnt have been better.the vocalist, is pretty good, w/ a strong classic rock sound. the bassist/drummer are two of the best i've ever heard or had the pleasure to see perform.barry sparks is amazing on his 6 string bass.and shane gallass, the drummer, reproduces simon phillips work ( bonus track into the arena)flawlessly, a near impossible task.this work includes an insturmental titled ""essence"" which was an instant schenker classic, this song alone is worth what you'll pay for the entire album.and as always mr. schenker does not disappoint. he was at the top of his game when this was recorded, he was apparently in a good place in life when he wrote this work, and it shows. his sound is fresh and he was probably inspired by the caliber of the talent in this recording.A MUST HAVE !!!!"
3,Very VERY basic,"I haven't played an instrument in years and haven't ever picked up a guitar or uke but still found this book to be too basic. On the positive side, it isn't costly."
2,"A reasonable book, but there are better options.","The reason I have given it two stars is that this book might be useful for absolute beginners with no background in music.While I respect the heritage of the Mel Bay series, if only because it helped me with a couple of things when I was learning guitar, this book can be supplanted by about 20 minutes of internet searching. To top it off, the songs are 'church songs' that a high percentage of people wouldn't recognize or be able to practice with.If you are an absolute novice to music (you've never touched an instrument), this book will be useful. If, however, you have any background this book will be overly simplistic. With the exception of the last 4 pages it has fewer than a dozen chord diagrams & nothing on tab. I may be sending it back & either going online to look for guitar chords (and a Uke chart) or to look for video lessons that would cost nothing but bandwidth."
4,helpful book,I bought this for my 23 year old son. The chords and info were helpful but the songs are ancient and therefore lame!
1,Terrible design,"The first time we used this product over the campfire, all four hot dogs slid right out the side when we turned it over. The two sections would not clamp down tightly enough to keep the hot dogs securely in place. Considering we only brought an 8 pack of hot dogs for our group of 5, we were less than thrilled. It's not a complicated product, so I really don't think it was operator error. It might be okay with big brats or really fat hot dogs, but the Oscar Meyer bun length hot dogs we tried wound up as firewood. Very disappointed and very displeased."
4,Hot dog roaster,Great idea but you need to just use it for specific things. Normal sized hot dogs slide out and into the fire when you're turning the hot dogs. Using jumbo sized hot dogs or brats work very well. We tried toasting bagels last weekend and it worked perfect!
3,Weinie Roaster,The design is OK except it doesn't hold skinny hot dogs. Had to use the skewer on them. Doesn't allow users to use it for anything else like marshmellows.
3,"Fantastic Idea, But it Missed the Mark","This is a very good idea, but sadly when we used them, they didn't work as planned. The hot dogs fell out whenever we flipped the roaster over to cook the dogs on the other side. We lost over 6+ dogs before we put them away. The guys thought the women didn't know what they were doing, and the women thought the same of the men. But it was the roasters themselves. A friend pointed out that the rings needed to be smaller for this to work correctly. But I think it needs a little more than that to truly keep your dogs from falling into the fire.I hope you're able to fix the problem, and test them yourself, before you put them back on the market. I'd love to order them again, when they actually work. :)Thanks!"
2,Parting Words for Councilman Chavous,"Two things anyone should take in to account before cracking this book.1. Charter schools were not the product of a mass demand by the residents of DC. It was essentially forced on the DC by the Republican dominated Congress. DC public schools have major problems, but that is hardly an excuse to force conservative social experiments on an unwilling population.2. Councilman Chavous was voted out of office soon after thsi book was published. It seems his constituents were not too hot on his advocacy of charter schools."
2,Pretty but missing the details,"While this book has some beautiful images, it is impractical as a travel book. Very little information about arriving in/departing from different cities or how to get around. Most telling editorial error is that their index of hotels and restaurants placing them on a map of the entire county -- completely useless. If you are looking for the information that makes traveling less stressful, look elsewhere."
4,A helpful introduction to Croatia,"This guide is great for getting started in your trip planning. It also includes information on eastern and central Croatia in addition to the coast. Some guides ignore the east. The pictures in the guide are wonderful and give you glimpses of what to expect. There are many helpful general travel insights that you need like information on changing money, use of credit cards, tipping, local customs, etc. We don't plan to stay and eat in the major tourist cities so the food and lodging info isn't that helpful to us. But overall, this guide was worth the money for when I can't be on the web getting info. The book has a British slant since it's from a British publisher but if you don't need all the references to be in dollars that won't be a problem."
5,Croatia (Eyewitness),You will not find a lot of current books on traveling in Croatia since the fighting only ended about 15 years a go and the travel writers seem to always take a long time before reviewing a county in depth. This book is typical Eyewitness quality and most of all up to date. We leave on a cruise to Croatia in a few weeks and wanted something we could review and learn a little about the country. This book has a good history of the country plus manay interesting site to visit. we do not purchase travel books for hotel accomodations or dining in restautants as the internet is normally more up to date. This is a good quality book and ordering on Amazon we got it at a great price plus fast free shipping at the time we ordered.
3,Croatia (Eyewitness travel Guides),"While the book was very informative, it was published in 2003. I would like to have had more up-to-date information."
5,A Gem Of A Book On The Subject Of Divine Healing,"Rev. Jones gives simple and practical advice in an area of spiritual life in which an increase in understanding is urgently needed by most Christians. If you accept the doctrine of spiritual healing as part of the atoning work of Jesus Christ, then this book can help you to bring spiritual healing down out the ethereal, theoretical realm, and into the real world, where it can make a life-changing difference."
5,Kid's digital camera,Given to a 3 year old. He loved it and we had a blast watching his creativity in picture choices. What a great idea and the fact that it works and he can see the pictures on the screen on back of camera helps him learn what works and doesn't work. Highly recommend.
1,Terrible Picture Quality,"It is true that my kids love to play with this camera. But the picture quality is really, really terrible. It is great as a toy but we had bought this camera so my kids could take their own pictures on our Disney cruise and use them to make a scrapbook. There was not one single useable picture from this camera. They were all horrible. It is fun to play with but don't expect any decent, useable pictures from it."
1,not worth it,"I wish this had been better but I don't think it is worth the money. The large size makes it difficult for little hands to manage, the delete button is annoying, the picture quality is terrible - forget flash photography. I'm sure you could buy a real digital camera for this price and at least be able to share and talk about the photos with your kids. It sounds good but my advice is to skip it and look for something else."
3,Tough enough for a little tike,I bought the camera for my grandson who is not quite 2 since he kept trying to use his dad's (my son). He really likes it but he keeps pushing the erase button so he will not have a portfolio anytime soon. The photo quality is bad but I'm sure he doesn't care. The camera is very pricy for the quality but I knew that before I bought it. If he had been at least 5 I would have bought him a real camera. I began taking photos at 5 so I know children that age can be responsible.
3,Great fun for a 4 year old but picture quality is not good,"My son loves his camera, and it's very easy to point and shoot but the picture quality is not good, it's like a cell phone camera(although to date I haven't found a kids camera that takes better pictures). It's also dumb that they make boys and girls models of the camera."
5,excellent first camera,I bought this for my 7 year old son. He wanted a digital camera like his older sister and this was a great choice for a first camera. It gives him the practice he needs to get the experience of a digital camera. It's very tough for a little boy.
4,Kid Tough Digital Camera,"The camera is a great idea for little kids with big ideas. My son loves to play with my camera, he loves to look through the screen and snap away and this camera allows him to do just that and i don't have to worry about him dropping it. It allows him to be very creative with his pictures."
4,Kid Tough Camera-a fun toy to have,"I purchased this camera for my 6 year old son, who really enjoys taking pictures. The camera itself is great; I have no complaints. But when it comes to downloading the pictures, you should make sure that you use the USB cable that came with it. I used the cable for my other camera and it wasn't a snug fit. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, all of the pictures immediately erased from the camera without transferring to the computer. As long as I have a tight fit with the cable, the pictures transfer with no problem.The only other drawback is that the pictures are of low quality. They are comparable to cell phone camera pictures, even though the camera has a flash. My son doesn't mind, though. He is just proud of all the pictures that he is able to take. All in all, I think it is a good purchase."
2,Total crud,This camera takes terrible pictures. Terrible. The delete key shouldn't make a fun noise because my kid likes to hit it to hear the sound.
2,Not worth it for children over 3 years of age,It is a durable camera and my three year old likes taking pictures with it and copying his photographer mama. For any children over 3 years of age it is not worth it at all. My 5 and 6 year old each got one for Christmas and they were both disappointed almost immediately in realizing that they cannot print their pictures. Both of them have been asking for real cameras ever since that will allow them to print the pictures for their photo albums and hanging on their walls. We would have been much better off buying them a slightly more expensive real camera and teaching them how to properly care for it.
2,"Durable & easy-to-use, but lousy quality pictures","I got this for my budding-photographer 4-year-old. He figured out how to use it right away, and the camera is built well, but we were surprised at the poor quality of both the preview image and the end-result photos. The preview shot is so bad that it's tough to even tell what the photo is OF, and the end result photos are certainly nothing you'd every print. They're pixelated and fuzzy, poor in quality overall. We are very disappointed and wouldn't recommend this product."
1,Louuusy,"Do not buy. Image quality is that of the first generation mobile phone cameras. It is sturdy, but you can barely see what the picture is. Internal memory allows for 48 pictures. My son used that up in 5 minutes. I added a 250MB but it does not recognize. Its a plan card that is 1X...My son now basiclaly uses it to pretend to take pictures. I will wait another year and buy him a regular camera an hope he doesn't use it for a baseball."
2,"Not a bad toy, but not as durable as we'd hoped at the price","We bought this camera 15 months ago for our son's fourth birthday. He was very excited at first, but he found the poor display kind of disappointing. When we put the photos on his computer for him to play with, he was a lot more interested, and we encouraged him to photograph mainly outdoors where the photo quality was better. (Only with absolutely fresh batteries did the flash work well.)But, as so many have pointed out, we bought it as a toy and it did what we expected it to do.Now, Jack is a pretty laid back fellow, and his camera didn't take a beating. We worked hard to help him learn to use the camera as though it were an adults camera, since that's our next step.Nonetheless, after a bit over a year, the camera has stopped working. Very disappointing."
3,It's good but didn't quite measure up to their first,"Thrown to the Wolves is ok but I find myself getting bored trying to listen to the whole cd quite a number of times.So after being bored from the cd, I just switch to their self-titled first cd and that's when it really rocks. Their 2nd album doesn't by far measure up to the first."
2,All the songs sound the same,Every song on this CD sounds alike to me. The songs aren't bad - they're just kinda boring. I can't remember how they go once they're over.
5,FOUR STAR MARY,"These guys rule! Their music is a mix between rock and alternative. It is possible that this is the best album i've ever listened to!They have this quality to put you in good mood, even if you've been in a ... mood all day. This is a must have for all real music lovers."
5,YOU MUST OWN THIS CD,Four star mary did it again! This is one of those albums where every song is great and you can listen to it anywhere and not get tired of it.
4,inexpensive fix for old canisters,"I purchased the brushed copper contact paper to cover some old Tupperware canisters so they'd go better with my new kitchen cabinets and drawer pulls. It was easy to use, but I did discover that I needed to be very careful with anything sharp, as the paper was easily scratched. I have yet to use the canisters enough to evaluate how well this fix holds up, but so far, it's far less expensive than buying new canisters (if I could find them in copper!)"
4,Can't Beat Mozart,"These are some great recordings. It really nice to listen to in the background. A word of warning, however, the Monroe Institute says that to get the proper effect from Hemi-Sync, it needs to be in a lossless audio format. So, buy the actual CD to get the Hemi-sync benefits. I didn't remember this advice until after downloading it, but it's still worth it. Great during homework!"
3,SO-SO,"I didn't really liked it, to low tones and does not get me in a good mood. I was looking for a going to sleep tape or a meditation, or a renewal. But I still listen to it sometimes."
1,better off with any good nips from hardware store,I bought these thinking they were essential for proper cutting of sevenstrand wire but these are just pure junk soft steel which nicks immediately then dulls to worthless. Get a good hardened steel pair at any hardware store.
4,Algeria group that makes you twirl and dance...,"Some friends of mine said, ""If you like the Gypsy Kings then try Zen zila"". So I tried them and really enjoyed their music and energy. Seattle winters can get pretty dreary with lack of sun so music to dance around the house is important for us. Listen to the song samples above to see if you like them too !Jon"
4,Yuu Watase does it again!,"The first work of Yuu Watase I read was Fushigi Yuugi, which kept me always wanting for more. When I found out about Ayashi No Ceres, I knew I had to read it.And, was I surprised about it!This totally goes in a different way than FY. Although we have our classic teenager, Aya, trying to find her way in the world, it is so different when she's in a constant hunt by their own family, but most of all by the inner force inside her. It really takes inside the story, and keeps you in it. I would say it's more mature than any other of Watase's works (there's some killing going on), but nonetheless it's part of the story-line, and what makes you understand the feeling and the situation Aya is living. We also have our comic relief there.If you love mystery, humor and romance, this is a must-read for you!"
5,Good replacement,"""Works great on my Sears opener. I probably will order another since my other old remotes are losing that nice tactile feedback you get when you click this remote. """
3,Need to be too close to garage door,This product requires that you be fairly close to the garage door before it opens it.
2,What I expected but still won't work,"I ordered this remotes for our automatic garage doors but they almost never work. Don't know if the problem is the doors remote receiver or the signal or what but it still seems like a lot of money invested in something that won't work... Next time, better get a new garage engine than waste my money."
5,on their way up,"this cd is fresh and has a number of great songs. although it's not the best cd i've bought this year, it is definitely a quality purchase. Personally, the fourth track is the best on the cd, but a number of them are stong. just give this band some time and they should be something big someday, provided that they keep making music like this. keep your eye on The Line."
5,Best CD Ever,"That last review is a joke, this is the best CD i've bought yet this year. the LINE has a totally original style, and you will NOT get bored with this album!"
3,"Made me squirm, but I stayed with it","Something about Susan Howatch's writing reminds me of a Barbara Michaels novel. But despite the traces of fluffy contrivance, as Howatch's characters struggle with their humanness and hubris they sometimes say something important or even profound. Jonathan Darrow, the worldly ex-monk, seems an especially worthwhile character in that respect (this is only the second Howatch novel I've read so far). My main complaint was that this book makes women look awfully silly! I kept wanting to tell Venetia to get over it already."
4,Only Book in Series written from a female perspective,This books was the most difficult of the series for me to deal with. Perhaps because the main character is a woman. The woman's situation with the Archdeacon is almost a foretelling of the current Clinton/Lewinsky affair in America. This entire series covers just about every imaginable human relationship and spiritual struggle. Almost anyone who reads these books will see themselves or those close to them in some of the moral struggles described. These struggles are described with amazing objectivity in my view.
2,"Bloated and Unstable , but works . . .","The only reason that I can possibly see for using GroupWise is for a network that uses Novell servers exclusively. This product is bloated, takes a while to load even on a 32-bit system and crashes a lot (especially when you try to get to the calendar). It contains a messaging system -- a sort of message board that can be used adequately for an intranet, and of course, scheduler for appointments and meetings (which typically remind you of a meeting several days after it is over). As for as a regular mail client to use for Internet mail links and general use, it is just too big and too slow. The server is more powerful than that of other mail servers usually, but it seems a slick marketing tactic to require you to use a Novell server as well to take full advantages of its capabilities. Eudora, Outlook Express, Pine, Elm are all free and work just as well with any server. Pretty, but really a colossal waste of money. A pain to maintain as well."
1,"Nice CD, not childrens' music","It's a very nice CD, but if you're expecting childrens' music, you'll be dissapointed. My daughter received this CD for Christmas, and while the family will be happy to add this CD to our collection of Latin music, we'll continue to look for Latin childrens' music.Very misleading packaging: ""Chosen by children, for children."" It's unlikely children would have selected this music. Very unlikely.This garners 4 stars for the music, then -3 stars for the dishonest packaging."
1,Very Misleading Program,"on the box this program is described as a program with up to dat roads, and trails, upon loading this program i found that thee were no trails at all except for the appilachin trail, i thought it might just be in this area so i checked some of the other areas included with this program and there were no hiking trails to be found, this of course was the primary reason that i purchased this program, for use with hiking. i thought that i might need to used te satellite and aerial images to get the hiking trails so i downloaded the areas i needed,. and it doesnt have any trail maps included, however you can manually add the trails, but i was looking for accurate trail maps not something i could have drawn with a crayon! this is a horrible program for anyone wishing to use it for hiking or finding trails of that type."
1,Best Mexican Rapper???,"Heck No, hes the best pakistani rapper though I'll give you that much, he ain't even mexican! He shouldn't be in the latino rap game! He also sounds like a man who hasn't reached puberty, have you heard his voice??? Don't try to compare this man to Mr.Shadow, Shadow has lyrical talent that Capone-E is so far from, not to mention beats, so please, if your into Pakistani rap, this is a hot one, but if u r down with raza, this ain't it!"
2,Dogs don't like it,"I was looking for an alternative to Cosequin chews since they are quite expensive so I decided to give these a try. I can't even tell you if they work since my dogs wouldn't even eat these! Also, they chews have less glucosamine and chondroitin per serving than Cosequin, something I didn't know until after I received them. My dogs like the Cosequin chews and they are also quite effective, so I am going back to those."
1,frustratingly inadequate,"Missing so much it is just utterly disappointing for the user. Please make a legitimate, usable dictionary available."
4,FUN Bollywood movie - the song is priceless...,"WOw! Long... and I enjoyed every minute. Will not change your life, though it does have a few Ghandisms interjected. I have watched and will watch again with friends. If you like Bollywood films, this will not dissappoint you!-Joe"
3,Fun,This movie is a light hearted comedy about a gangster who meets Ghandi and becomes more philosophical and relies less on violence and more on peaceful means of accomplishing his goals.
1,Not bad if you want the exercise and open the door yourself!,"This product takes about 30 times hitting the button before it will open the garage door! I have even gotten creative and will try all sorts of methods to see if I can get it done sooner...So if you need or want the exercise then you might as well get out of the car and open the door yourself! I have tried reprograming it several times as well as changing the battery, but it has never worked out of the box. Waste of $$!"
1,Did Not Work As Promised,"I have an old Sears opener and even though the literature says that my opener is compatible with this model, it was not."
5,Had it working in two minutes. *DIP Switch Remote*,Wanted a second garage door opener. Bought this and matched the dip switch pattern from my original remote to the remote I bought and BOOM it opened the garage door! Much cheaper than buying universal remote at Lowe's (around $30).
5,great remote openers,I bought 2 openers for each of my sons. They were easy to program and work great. It was much cheaper than buying them in town plus I got free shipping!
4,Does the job,"We moved into an apartment and they only gave us one garage door opener. So we were looking for a second and this was a great addition. It's much smaller than the one we were given and works just great. The range isn't as good but thats ok, it still does the job."
5,remote garage door opener,"My old remote stoped working even with new battery. I was concerned that I would not be able to find it cause my door opener is 16 years old. Amazon and its partners had one. It work great ,and to my surprize it come with new battery. Very pleased."
5,great garage door opener,Fast delivery and a working garage door opener makes for a happy husband. It was easy to program and worked the first time we tried it. Thank you.
5,Please release,I really hope they release this on dvd soon. Prequel to the Dukes of Hazzard. Should be really great on DVD.
3,Shoe runs small,"I thought this shoe ran small, so you should order the next size up. The shoe is very attractive and looks like good quality. The sole is a little too slick, though."
4,"Maureen in LI, NY","I bought these shoes for the purpose of looking a bit more dressed up than a flip flop. They look great and feel great. One thing, they are very tight at first, but after a few wearings the leather stretches. I would prefer if the foot bed was a bit wider. I am not wide, but the footbed is quite narrow."
5,Quality sound...,I am loving this timer! It's the perfect size and light weight. The gong sound is so subtle and it reverberates ever so gently. Now I can practice Reiki without having to look at the clock every two minutes!
2,Not Loud Enough,"I wish I could have heard it in advance of purchase. It is very nice, but even on the loud setting, it is too soft wish it was louder. I also like to use it in a group and it's too soft for that as well."
2,Good but not as expected,The product is great but it just looks bigger than when it arrives .the wood is really nice
4,Great for ever Christrian Tween!,"The review was written by a real tween girl. This is a great magazine for every tween. Clubhouse has every thing for everybody. It has cool Christian comics, nice pictures and has easy to understand stories. It also has reviews from a Christian perspective about media you see daily, from the Jonas Brothers to newest movies and CDs. I do recommend Clubhouse for advanced 9 year olds to 13 years. The magazine even has cool stories with more than one ending. You chose the ending you like! Clubhouse is a fun to find in the mail."
2,"Okay, I THINK that I am a little ttttooooo old for this","I originally got Clubhouse Jr, when I was about 7, maybe 6, and I think that I liked it at the time. Then when I was about 9 I switched to Clubhouse. Now I am 12, and VERY mature for my age, (at least thats what every one tells me) and I am SO bored when I get it and can't wait to switch to Brio. I look through it to the art pages and then to the Ask Away section and then I throw it away. I WOULD HOWEVER, recommend it to kids up to the age of 10, maybe even 11, but, being a 12 year old girl, I am more interested in the topics that Brio covers, and not about pet rat comics and stories about how little Sally is sad because she has no friends. But it is good, and I did have 2 things published in it over the past few years."
3,"Great Game Book, Worst ActionScript 2.0 Book","I found this book great to learn programming basic game physics but it is certainly one of the worst book to pick if you want to upgrade your ActionScript knowledge from 1.0 to 2.0.The source codes are ALMOST NO DIFFERENCE from ActionScript 1.0. It is almost as if the arthur thinks that by adding variable declarations, ActionScript 1.0 becomes ActionScript 2.0.No true Object-Oriented Programming practices (which is the true strength of ActionScript 2.0) at all. The coding style are simply ActionScript 1.0 structure (with variable declarations).Still, this book is great to pick if you are new to game development. However, be aware that this book is NOT demonstrating how to program in ActionSctip 2.0 properly."
3,Good Start but lacking details,"I was hoping that this book would shed some light on how to apply practical mathematics to AS2.0 in order to produce some realistic effects. It provides a good start and even gives good descriptions about the inner workings of some of the concepts.I took two years of H.S. physics, trig, and calc and I still find the explanations lacking for those of us that require the ""why's"" to all our questions.The examples on the CD are extremely helpful IF you understand the code. Sorting through the files to find the code is hard and some of the files seem unfinished.I would get this used if given the chance to do it all over again."
2,so small!!!,"The snow globe is teeny tiny! I couldn't believe it when I opened it. Luckily it was for my nephew who is four, so he didn't care!"
2,This book is OK at best.,This book is somewhat well written for a technical book. It is not well written by any other measure. It is hard to follow and sometimes confusing especially if you are trying to learn the basics about turbine engines from ground zero. Almost all of the illustrations are crummy stock material from the engine manufacturers. I learned twice as much from the Pratt and Whitney web site in 1/10 the time.
3,too narrow,I'm sure for other people this would be excellent but I have a very wide foot & didn't work... comfortable
3,not as good as other similar products,"I've bought a variety of similar slippers with terry uppers and non-slip flexible soles.Compared to the others, this terry is more synthetic-feeling. My feet sweat in it so much more, and so I need to wash them so much more often.Plus the amount of fabric inside on the inner sole is so much less. That's where I really need it to be absorptive.Lastly, the soles crack in the wash very easily. That never happened with any other similar slippers."
2,Not worth it,"I wanted to give up on this novel because it is so confusing. I usually enjoy a challenging read that requires my attention and memory, but I found many passages in this book that I could not decipher. I kept going because I thought at some point everything would fall into place. After slogging through the entire book, I felt I had wasted my time."
1,I just couldn't finish this.,"This is going to be a very easy book review, for the fact that I simply could not make myself finish this novel.Taking place at the end of the 18th century in England, the novel centers around James Tilly Matthews, a man who has been institutionalized seemingly without reason. The time period in which this novel takes place, if you happened to have opposite political views, you could be jailed, killed, or institutionalized. Both Margaret Matthews, his wife, and the chief apothecary of the institution, John Haslam, are struggling to find the reason that James is institutionalized.Though this is based on historical events, I could not make myself continue reading this book. I was interested at the very beginning, and the further I went, the further my mind slipped away from it. Maybe I'll pick it up one day and finish it, but right now, I just can't.I would recommend this for anyone that enjoys historical fiction. Maybe you'll have better luck than I did with it."
2,Bedlam,"Seems very thoroughly researched and really makes you feel, see, and even smell the horror of this legendary madhouse. The problem for me is its unflagging, relentless grimness. Noplace I'd want to visit."
4,Mending Places,"This was the first book that I have read by Denise Hunter. I really enjoyed it. The story is very interesting, and the characters are very likeable. She really throws a twist in at the end, and when it is over, you want the story to keep going. She is a very realistic Christian writer. I have been a Christain for over 25 years, and I am far from perfect, neither are her characters. There is a book two to Mending Places called Saving Grace. I plan to order that one as well."
5,Hunter is quickly becoming my FAVORITE author!,"This is my 2nd Denise Hunter book that I have read, and I have to say she is AMAZING! It was a fluke that I picked up the first book I read of ""sweetwater gap"" and happy I am. Hunter is SO colorful and personal in her pieces. She quickly grabs you into the characters lives and emotions. Micah in this story is sadly living a turmoil that MANY people are sadly living. He struggles on a daily basis of personal forgivness that so many can relate to. You feel like a part of the story. The story line is so believable and you feel like the conflict could be happening to you.THANK YOU Hunter, I am a FAN...keep the awesome pieces coming!"
2,Disappointing,I've read three other Denise Hunter books and loved them but this one was incredibly disappointing. I only made it halfway before putting it down. I found it slow and the characters seemed immature to me...maybe not developed enough. When Hanna confronts Micah and tells him that God told her they were meant to be together was the point where I just couldn't read anymore. I hope the second in the series is better than this.
2,the first book i've returned to the publisher,"This book was unrealistic in it's character's emotional processing and the events that took place are highly unlikely. Author depends a lot on God's character and grace and attributes it to human characters... I'm sorry, but if i was raped horribly and it took ,what seems like,less than 24 hours to forgive the person who did it... that would be miraculous, but it is written normal as can be in this story. secondary characters were given far too much detail only to leave readers hanging in the end; thinking their involvment would have been more meaningful. Vague references to time passing "" and they talked late into the night"" (about what? why even mention it?), filler material that wasnt necessary.sorry to say, but i took the offer to return it to publisher for my refund. have yet to receive the refund, but that's a whole other story..."
5,"The Jets really ""Rocket 2 U"" on this cd!","This is the best greatest hits comp you'll be able to find for the Jets. Their great late-80s songs will keep you wanting more and more, and having this greatest hits cd will be one of the most fun cds in your collection. It features 10 chart hits and I guarantee you will love this cd!"
5,the Jets made music real...,"I believe the Jets were popular in the SF Bay Area when i was in middle school. I loved their music. I played their cd over & over. I knew all the words by heart, like the back of my hand. Whats strange is I guess I grew up with their distant cousins, which also hold music concerts currently in the SF Bay Area. Anyway i ended up having my daughter who is half Togan and is distantly related to them via marriage. Sheesh! I hope one day to meet them. That would be awsome! Such an inspiration. They made songs truely magical.-Villa/Sanft"
2,Jet propelled crash,"Jets were a family group, a bunch of talented kids without the tailwind of controversy. Not a Jackson group, not a Partridge Family fake... a true love of harmony and hits.Hits they had, ""Crush on You"", ""You Got it All"", all with innocence and MTV videos that made pre-adolescent girls buy leggings in pastel colors.Not that anyone cares anymore, but Jets are worth a grin and a sigh."
3,Brother-Sister Act,"The Jets were a mid 80's pop/r&b band made up of eight brothers & sisters in the Wolfgramm family. Hailing from Minneapolis, they offered a poppy teenage alternative to the Prince sound that emanated from the city during that time. They ended scoring five top ten pop hits between 1986-1988 before falling from view. ""Crush On You"", ""You Got It All"", ""Rocket 2 U"" and others are all harmless pop tunes, but have an undeniable catchiness."
3,Foghat - 'Millennium Tour' (WEA) DVD-Running Time:78 minutes,"I've heard other fans refer to Foghat as pretty much being a two-album band.Personally,I think they have more like four,maybe even five worthy lp's out.'Millennium Tour' was taped at a 1999 gig in Houston,TX.My only complaint about this DVD is there are entirely TOO many interview segments between the ten(10)songs that are played.Other than that,every Foghat fan should get a lot out of it.Tracks I thought were good to experience once again were ""Stone Blue"",the bluesy ""Sweet Home Chicago"",""Somebody Sleeping In My Bed"",""Fool For The City"" and their energetic encore ""Slow Ride"".Their new song ""Rock Your House"" is actually pretty good,I thought.Line-up:Lonesome Dave Peverett(R.I.P.)-guitar&vocals,Tony Stevens-bass,Brian Bassett-slide guitar and Roger Earl-drums.Lonesome Dave,my friend,you will be missed."
2,"Label is misleading, should say ""20% original ingredients""...","This is not Foghat. OK, this is not yer Daddy's Foghat, and that's for darn sure 'cause I'm as old as yer Daddy. This is more like a Foghat ""tribute"" band with the actual original drummer from Foghat sitting in. I used to go front-stage at all Foghat shows that I could attend, and that was the best boogie going along with ZZ Top. I don't mind anyone making a living, but those that live on the dead are generally not highly regarded. If you want live Foghat, good luck. It seems that the guys didn't think much of music videos and there is very little out there excepting some very touching reformations that occurred some time shortly before the untimely and unfortunate passing of Lonesome Dave Peverett."
4,Very quiet,"I've got this item from Amazon last Saturday. Weather didn't let me check the cooling efficiency of this unit, but i plugged it in anyway, ran for some time, and found out this unit is very quiet. I have another AC similar capacity (LG 5050 BTU), Panasonic runs obviously quieter. In ""cool"" mode on the highest fan speed it's atill runs quieter than my window double fan."
1,"weak, noisy","I give it 1 star because it is the least that I can give. Yes,it is only 5200 BTU, but it should not be so weak. My small room is smaller than 150 sq-feet, however it takes this powerless tiny machine 2 hours to cool my room to 78 F. Ironically, it sounds like a car from 80s'. Maybe Panasonic does good in other type of ACs, but not this one. Save your time & money on it."
2,Why?,"I own the DVD alone. I can't imagine shelling out the money for this bloated ""National Geographic"" collection of snapshots including a 300-page book! Definitely NOT a surf DVD, as there are more shots of camels than surfers or surfing. The surfers are not identified in the movie, and the majority of footage looks like a travelogue on some public channel. No story line, no dialogue, no introduction or really any reason to be other than it was cool to do some traveling and take some footage. Boring in the extreme, and very disappointing."
5,A Page Burner!,"A page burner! Great beginning. Great ending. And in the middle is a guy with no combat or survival skills, running for his life. Good guys are after him. Bad guys are after him. Every step takes him deeper into the broiling Mexican desert and every time it looks like he's going to catch a break, another plot-twist you never saw coming gets him in even deeper dodo. I couldn't put it down."
5,This is a novel you won't want to put down,"G.G. Robins is a bright new star on the crime fiction horizon, and this novel is one you shouldn't miss. He combines an intriguing plot, lifelike dialog, a thorough knowledge of his book's location and a natural talent for story telling to provide a tale you can't put down until you read it all. I rarely recommend novels, but this is the best I've read in years, and I recommend it without reservation. I look forward to reading Robins' next book."
2,Not a fan,"My husband I bought this sprinkler for our kids that range in age from 13 to 4. The picture on the box made it look super fun and after having bought a sprinkler that just didn't work right, we were on the hunt for a new one. What a disappointment. The tentacles just stay stationary and do not wave around no matter how high or low the water pressure. The only movement of water was from the center part spinning. Needless to say, I don't think we will be buying any more sprinklers. I'm tired of spending $15 only to get them home to find they don't work as promised. Boo."
3,Not as pictured,"We wanted and needed a sprinkler that sprayed lots of water in lots of directions, like the picture shows. We have 3 kids and our next door neighbor has 4 kids. The picture looks awesome, but for us, the water never sprayed as high or as wildly as the picture shows. We turned the water all the way up and to our knowledge, we don't have a ""governor"" on our water. Other sprinklers have worked great, just not big enough for 7 kids.It is cute and different, but I do wish it would spray better."
3,"Toddler loves it, seems fairly durable, arms don't wiggle like the photo.","My toddler loves this thing, even though it takes him a few minutes each time to get ""warmed up"" to it. We make big production about ""tickling"" it to wake it up (at which point I turn it on or step off the hose). He'll stick his head under the spray or will run under the arcs of water. That said, the arms have NEVER wiggled around like you see in the product photo, regardless of the pressure (if you increase the water pressure, they go straight up, if you decrease the water pressure, they fall over completely). We even have one arm that just always lays there.It seems to be fairly durable, too, as my son constantly drags it around by the hose and/or drops it on the cement, and it's still going strong after many months.I'd recommend this--just don't expect exactly what you see in the photo. I have uploaded my own photo so you can see what it looks like on a regular basis. I am giving it three stars for an ""it's okay"" rating."
5,Great toy for summer!,I just loved it. It's everything they promised. My dog didn't like it as much as I'd wished. He still wants me to walk around with the backyard hose.
4,Express Geyser Blast Sprinkler,All the children in the neighborhood enjoyed the sprinkler. A real hit for a hot summer. Good purchase - received the item on time.
1,Does not work as advertised,"After receiving this product as the new summer water toy, my wife and I were very excited as where our 3 children. The package shows a boy of 6 or 7 with water streaming up higher than them and playing and having fun. My children are 6 so the water should be higher. Well the water goes 2 feet into the air and the crazy straws that shoot out water don't even move. Disappointing. If you actually hold up the toy more water comes out the bottom then goes out the top. We even got another one from a local store thinking ours was broken. Nope - the design is just that bad. Clearly the pictures on back and front are fabricated and this toy should not be sold. Also at our house we have high water presure and usual summer water toys perform very well.Do not buy this water play toy. It is not worth the money."
1,Terrible.,"Starting to wonder if he five star reviews are legit. Like many of the other disappointed parents here, this sprinkler far from delivers on its promise. Even with the pressure on full blast, the arms don't move and the overall water dispersal is pathetic."
1,Don't be fooled!,"Got it on major clearance at a big box store, but still overpaid! The plastic straws coming out on the sides do not move, just lay open spraying water on the ground. The ball in the middle spins, but little water comes out, so there was no Geyser Blast for us!"
3,Fun but not built well....,"I grew up using the Willie Waterhead version of this product and loved it. This product isn't the same quality. We received the product and found the antennas weren't working. We contacted the company and they were quick to ship us another one...great customer service!! The second one arrived and it worked better. The one thing we didn't like was much of the water exits the bottom of the product and greats a pretty decent ponding effect. Also, seems like a inefficient way for the product to work. Overall, the product wasn't what we hoped for."
2,Waste of money,Way to expensive for what it does! Waste of money for us - 6 and 7 year old boys. Would probably be fun for 3-4 year olds.
1,Major piece of crap,"The kids like a $5 sprinkler from home depot better.. I feel totally ripped of by this .. I don't remember why i didn't return it.. maybe i was busy .. it was last summer, i don't remember.. I have the buyers remorse .."
2,Not worth it!,I actually bought this at Shopko. The little tubes that are supposed to shoot water do not shoot water the way it's supposed to. It just shoots it straight out. There is no wiggling whatsoever.
1,"If 1 foot of water is what you want, this ""geyser"" is for you!",Just purchased this item and it was a total bust. The water didn't even get about 8-10 inches. We ended up turning on our yard sprinklers and letting the kids run through that. Too bad.
3,Dont buy from AMAZON!,"I bought this today at target for $11.99! This sprinkler is not worth $20! In fact im not real pleased with it at all. The hoses came kinked and dont move around or stand straight. It did not look like the picture at all, however my 2 year old still enjoyed this very much, I will not be returning it because watching my son have fun is worth the $12, but like I said, If i would have paid $20 for it, it would be returned."
1,SW Express Geyser Blast Sprinkler,This toy serves a better purpose as a sprinkler for watering the lawn. The recommended age group would be better at 3-5 yrs and even then that might be a little old. The picture for the toy does not do it justice. It makes it seem like the toy will be a lot of fun when in reality it is quite boring.
4,Buy at Toy's R Us,"Good sprinkler, but I was dismayed when I opened the box and found that right on the package it said it was sold at Toy's R Us for $12.99! Don't buy at Amazon- go to Toy's R Us!!"
4,Good but not excellent!!!,"I have recently acquire this product and what I have to say about it is that if you dont have a very strong or good water pressure it wont work very well, and it doesen't work like in the picture."
2,"Great potential, if it worked right","This sprinkler had great potential and worked great right when the water first comes on (for 5 seconds) and then the arms get stiff and stop whirling about. The arms are what my kids were most excited about, so it was quite a disappointment. We moved the sprinkler to different areas, different hose hook-ups and do not believe it is a problem with too much or not enough water pressure. Because the arms are made of a very thin rubber/plastic, we suspect that the problem MAY be that our water is too cold and the tubes are becoming rigid from the very cold water. Nonetheless, this sprinkler was a disappointment as the water did not spray all that far and the tubes pointed straight out to the side or down towards the ground. A regular oscillating lawn sprinkler (from lawn and garden section) would be more fun."
1,Doesn't work,"The design alone is enough to almost guarantee the product won't do anything but spurt a little water from some of the tubes, with a LOT of water leaving through the openings on the bottom and the area where the ball at the top is SUPPOSED to form a seal when the water is on. I've returned it."
1,"Awful sprinkler, did not work at all.","My boys thought it looked like so much fun. We pulled it out of the package, hooked it up to the hose and it worked correctly for about 10 seconds. The center stream that is supposed to spin around only spins if you hold the sprinkler on it's side. And the little arms that are supposed to wiggle around, the water just shoots strait up in the air and does not wiggle at all. We tried different water pressure settings, we tried every thing we could think off. We even took the back off to see if something was broken. But discovered that it only works properly if held up in the air on it's side, or for the first 10 seconds after you turn the hose on. Do not buy this sprinkler. I will be returning ours."
1,poorly made...,This product wouldn't attach correctly to the standard hose. We believe it was a manufacture mistake. I would not recommend this product..its a waste of money.....
1,Disappointing,"We had pretty much the same experience as the other 1 star reviewers. We do get a bit of a spiral out of the central ball, but the arms do not wiggle and we lose way more water out the bottom than what is sprayed by the arms. We'll keep it, and it will probably get some use this summer, but I would not recommend this toy to anyone."
1,Dont buy it.,I should have read the negative reviews more carefully before buying this sprinkler. It simply does not work. Most of the water leaks from underneath the toy and the plastic tubes hardly move at all. It was a complete waste of money.
4,Splash in the Blast Stokke I got It!,This in my opinion is the best sprinkler ever. Only 4stars because it could use SOME improvement. Like another less generous reviewer said not all the noodles fly about at the same time. Thats ok with my kids. It is still the best one I have found. This toy vastly improved the play life of my young children.
4,Fun sprinkler,My grandchildren have a great time with this sprinkler because of its varied sprays and its gentler water force compared to a standard lawn sprinkler. I cannot respond to the question on durability because the sprinklers are relatively new. My one criticism -- and it is probably not remediable -- is that the sprinkler will not turn when the water pressure is reduced intentionally to limit the spray area. It would be nice to have some sort of an option on the area covered so that it could be used in a smaller yard space and still retain its swirling features.
1,Garbage - Don't waste your money,Most of the water leaks out of the bottom. It works nothing like the pictures and if you are unsatisfied you will have to pay to return this item. Buy a traditional garden sprinkler instead. They are must more reliable.
1,never worked,"This thing is junk, the hoses never spun around like shown on the picture.I gave it away to some more needy kids to play with."
5,Very enjoyable,"This sprinkler is very cute, and it does spray like the picture. Although my kids are a bit older, they enjoyed putting it by the Splash Bomber and getting sprayed as they slid by it. Its also nice to have when smaller children are visiting. It waters the grass evenly and I didn't have a mud hole in one area as much as other sprinklers I've tried."
2,watch the age when purchasing this. Scares those too young !,"Later on when my son is older, he will have a blast with this. But for now, it's sitting in a corner collecting dust. My son is almost 17 months old and this scares him too much. He stands a good 20 ft. away and just stares. Way too agressive. This coming from a boy that LOVES to play with water all the time. Just not this type of water delivery system. He loves to play with water hoses and swim in the pool assisted....this is just way too much for him at this point in time"
1,Waste of money,"I am not a 4 year old kid, so cannot tell what goes on in kids' minds when they see it.I bought it this past summer, and kept it outside in the backyard for two parties. There were at least 20 kids total ranging from 3 to 7 years. Not one of them was interested in playing around this.It does have an interesting pattern of sprinkling, but if the kid is standing in one spot the water only comes there may be 10% of the time (the exact number of course might be wrong, but you get the point).None of the kids (including my own) spent more than 30 seconds and they were done. Good thing I had a couple of inflatable pools and other things to entertain the kids.Someone else mentioned it's good for watering the lawn as well - no way Jose !Totally not worth the [...] I spent on it. Will not recommend it."
1,Total Crap,"This thing hardly worked to begin with and then after three weeks of use, it just stopped working completely. Total piece of crap."
2,Just OK. Not worth the price.,"The advertisement picture for this product does not represent what it actually looks like when I turned it on. The spiral of water in the middle does not actually look like a spiral and it only shoots up about 3 feet at the most. Their are 7 tubes on the sides that are supposed to slash around while shooting water. They actually just sat on the ground and just made a big puddle around the sprinkler. I ended up plugging 4 out of the 7 tubes up, so that only 3 tubes can release water, hoping it would help make the water come out stronger. It only helped a little. It is nothing like the picture and it is NOT that I do not have good water pressure from my hose. I actually have fairly good water pressure. I wish I had not paid so much money for it. My next door neighbor told me the other day that she just ordered the same exact sprinkler and she got it for $10 cheaper!!!!! That made me even more disappointed in my purchase!"
1,Where's the water??,With the hose screwed in tightly and water on full blast we barely got 6 inches of water out of this thing. Just made a big soggy spot on the lawn. Only thing my kids used this for was to wash their hands and feet off in after they stepped in all the mud it made.
4,Super insight on how leadership is performed.,"For those readers who want to study leadership from a coaching point of view, this is the book for them. All the major charactersistics of leadership are discussed and examplified. Interesting way to run a ""company."" If hard work pays off, then is the evidence that supports it."
1,This book is over hyped,This book was a lot more complicated than you would expect for a football book. I would not recomend it at all
2,boring,Couldn't connect to the music. It didn't have a 'wow' factor. It did nothing for me emotionally or mentally. Disappointed.
2,Concern with regard to translation,"The words are indeed deep and thought provoking. I am having a problem with the translation from Aramaic ultimately, to modern English. I find it very difficult to take the Aramaic version as a template for what we read in the NIV or KJV of the bible. Although the translations are there. I can't seem to find the bridge. They seem too disparate. I found it disturbing."
4,"My impressions on ""Prayer of the Cosmos""","My impressions on ""Prayer of the Cosmos"":It was a good book. The original language of the Evangel was most likely Aramaic. Evil men must have ordered the destruction of the Aramaic originals, and kept only the Greek texts, a common phenomenon in Christianity."
4,Book review,The Binder's Road arrived in record time and was just as advertised. Overall a good experience. four more words required.
3,Tired of waiting for DVD version,Waiting&waiting for it to come out on DVD and it's not worth this extreme wait. I trult hoped it would but I guess NOT everything comes out on DVD.
5,You can't go wrong with this series!,"When I was in high school I'd read ""The Valley of Horses"", and loved it. I had a hard time putting it down. It was a struggle, though, since I hadn't previously read ""The Clan of the Cave Bear""... but that didn't stop me from re-reading the book.Last month I'd ordered the series... and I couldn't put it down. There are a few parts in the books that were hard to read (the violence and death of beloved characters, or extensive descriptions or repeated lines from prior books to help us remember key things). Yet I couldn't put the books down.I finished reading ""The Shelters of Stone"" this morning, including the excerpt for the soon-to-be-released final installment of the series (3 more weeks...). I can't wait!"
4,Will I live to see the last book,"I have read all 5 ""Earth Childres"" books many many times as have my 4 daughters. Jean is not a very proficient writer and I have joked in the past that I hope to live long enough to read the last one. Now is is getting quite critical. I an now in my 70's. I just got up to see when the copyright date is on the firs one. It is 1980. Reading these books had been a 30 year saga for me. This is really ridiculous. Get with it Jean!"
1,"Repetitive and boring - first two books good, rest of the series for $ only","I loved the first two books of this series. What a disappointment beyond that - ugh! Cannot describe how disempowering the story was book three and beyond (I kept reading hoping she would come back to her original form and good writing, she did not.), boring does not even begin to describe how monotonous and repetitive the story was - repeating whole sections within the same book and entire chapters word-for-word in subsequent books. Do yourself a favor, read the first two books and pretend like there are no more."
5,In-depth astrology work,"If you're interested in charting your own horoscope, this book would be a good start. Russell Grant teaches you all about astrology and it many elements of analysis. Nice work."
4,excellent,"This book was very informative to me.I have read many books about lupus,butI still learned some things from thisbook. Doesn't explain much about thetests, but all in all was a prettygood book."
5,Better than the source material!,"A great and diverse collection of remixes of tracks taken from Ruby's latest full length, Short-Staffed At The Gene Pool. Lots of surprising and enjoyable stuff, ranging from tongue-in-cheek dance mixes - ""Sweet Is (Loop Of The Fruit Remix by Console)"" -- to totally leftfield reinterpretations for the headphone set - ""Lilypad (Max Tundra Remix)""."
3,No guitar here!?!?,The title of this CD is a bit deceptive. There is no guitar on it! It's a fine CD of Mingus music but not if you are looking for guitar versions.
4,T.I. The Self called King of the South,"Ti who had a #4 album but this is the original T.I.who hails him self the King of the South here is some stuffabout it.Here are the Ratings of the Album 10 year vet.Thisis all underground southern style he is a good rapper.Thishas some tight songs on it.Has Beenie Man I think I,ve heardLyrics 9/10 Production 8/10 X Factor 8/10 Style 9/10 Voice 9/10Music 8/10 Innovative 7/10 Classic 7/10 Guest 8/10 Blends 8/10Overall 81 wich is a 4 Mic release the Beats on this album soundlike the Southern classic Comin out Hard fans of the Dirty Southstyle of rap should buy this album it is pretty good."
5,Classic Period !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I know that alot will say that Trap Music was his comin out but if u honestly listened 2 this album and do not believe that this album is without a shadow of a doubt a classic then something is wrong it's straight raw and uncut this is T.I. B4 24's and all of the other stuff without I'm Serious there is no Trap Music or Urban Legend the reason he's so successful now is because he paid his dues and he knew that people had no choice but 2 feel him having said that I'm Serious the title says it all
2,"Blackalicious carries this comp, otherwise it ...","I originally preordered this because it was listed as a Blackalicous/Jurassic 5 collaboration, and that idea alone was enough to.... However, when I got it in the mail I discovered it was just a comp that happened to have Blackalicious and J5 on it, along with a handful of others....Anyway, I'd already heard the included Blackalicious song (40 oz. for Breakfast) and it's by far one of the best hip hop songs of all time. But again, I'd already had it. THE REST OF THE SONGS ON THE CD DO *NOT* SELL IT. It's quite bad. The J5 song and the Eyedea song are exceptions, but everything else basically...."
3,short cables,"have a fountain that needs 3 light to be lit from all sides. this is the only 3 light pond equip i have been able to find so i am stuck with this model. mine typically dies in about a year every year, the cable runs are getting shorter and shorter as are the connectors between the individual lights. and with each new revision in this product the bulbs fry faster and faster. on this last install am getting 3 months per bulb rather than a whole spring summer fall. but i am stuck with needing a 3 light source. oh well, it's only money....right?"
3,Lighting is good but....,"The distance between lights is only 2' so you cant expand very far. Also, the sensor for the timer for the lights to come on is ON the transformer its self, so if you hide it like I did by putting it under your deck, it comes on when it gets cloudy or rainy, then runs the cycle and wont come on at night. You need to mount it in the daylight and I dont want it visible. Other then that, it works fine. They should have the wire with the eye so you can run the sensor anywhere you want closer to the daylight."
1,Worthless when submerged.,"Purchased to light fountain. Wire length between lights prevents spreading them out. Would have to cement base of light to fountain floor because bouyancy of the submerged lights prevents them from sitting down.... they float! Finally after arranging them, wiring them...REWIRING THEM and testing all circuits the darn things would not illuminate!!! Directions are worthless and don't even mention the timer feature. They do say to hold your finger over the sensor for 30 seconds... but they never light!!!! This set is going back! Forget it Beckett."
5,Excellent product for a 30-minute nap or to use to fall asleep,"I have been using the Catnapper for many years. Someone I work with gave it to me who had gotten this and other Hemi-Sync recordings from her father-in-law who was an acupuncturist. All you do is lie down or get comfortable in a chair and put your earbuds on. The narrator will guide you to relax and fall asleep for 30 minutes and then wake you up again. I have used this to fall asleep too. When I use it to fall asleep I listen to it twice and stop it once the narrator starts the final count that brings you back up from your nap. I highly recommend it. I have also used Time Management, Creativity and Concentration. They seem to have some new products available on MP3 and I can't wait to try them. I thought this company had gone out of business. In the past I had to order their products from New Zealand at $30 USD a recording."
4,Very funny with lots of good music and jokes!,Whenever I need a 'pick me up' I put on this CD. It is lots of fun with catchy music and funny story telling between each song. Our whole family enjoys it and the kids often request to here it.
4,Sit!!,"I love Inuyasha. I actually got these beads when I first bought the Season One boxed set. A little extra but well worth it. I wore these for months around my college campus and got several questions on them as well as amusing my friends with our rendition of Sit (we even started making up a Beads of Subjugation song).The only downside to these is, like with any elastic, it wears out over time. When it happened to mine I simply went to a nearby store's arts and crafts section, got a necklace clasp and a leather cord and remade the necklace (the leather's a bit thick so I had to essentially thread it through the bead openings with monofilament fiber). Still looks the same and I'm once again wearing it.Whether you cosplay or just like the series, this is a good buy."
2,Good but it pinches!,It kept on pinching the back of my neck at first and it also gets snagged in my hair. Even though it was amazing when I was inuyasha's fangirl
2,does not make sense,ok shipping was fast but what the heck... most of the fangs are on the opposite side of the necklace. its retarted now i have 2 find a good chain necklace and put it 2gether myself w/ the fangs correctly facing the RIGHT WAY ... cuz some1 didnt assemble it correctly ..
1,Broke within 3 months of normal use,"As others have stated buy OEM, this aftermarket door handle broke within 3 months of normal use. Seller does not stand behind their product and offered no replacement even though I contacted in a timely manor. They strung me out time wise on replacing and then closed the dispute as not within replacement period.I bought OEM this time and was only about $5 more from another Amazon vendor, well worth not buying aftermarket or dealing with this seller."
2,"Needs to be an ""abridged"" version","This would have been a great biography except for one fatal flaw. The author insists of spending page after page summarizing most of Bela's movies. That doesn't make for an interesting read, so you start skipping big chunks to get back to the biographical part of the book. After a while, you just end up frustrated. This book should be re-released with the film summaries removed or cut down to a paragraph each. If we want to know everything that happens in the film, we'll watch it!"
3,Buyer beware: the product description misrepresents the artists,"With such fine performers listed, I expected a treat. Unfortunately, the artists listed are only (for each selection) one of several actually playing on that track. Thus, Johnny Cunningham did play on that one, but in a muted accompanying role-- could have been anyone, really. The same holds for the other tracks-- the results are very bland."
4,A fine collection of early bop gems.,"The personnel listed for these 13 tracks from various dates between February of 1945 and May of 1946 reads like a who's who of bop. Dizzy Gillespie's trumpet leads groups including, Charlie Parker on alto, Sonny Stitt on alto, a young Dexter Gordon on tenor, drummers Shelly Manne and Kenny Clarke, Vibraharpist Milt Jackson, and bassist Ray Brown. All of the selections are classic bop numbers performed in small combos or high energy big band settings. The sound quality is fairly good for material from this period. Overall this is a worthwhile cd for fans of Diz and classic bop."
2,Works and looks like the original,This is the fifth remote we've gone through. These remotes are cheap both in price and quality. I'd like to toss them and start over but we live in a gated community and we are forced to use this particular brand. Yes they work but consider them disposable.
5,It Works,It's the correct remote. Set-up was easy and it works even from inside the house through walls.
2,Required Class Reading SPOILER,"If you are buying this book, more likely than not it is required reading for your women's literature class. To help guide you along (since this can be a hard read for some people)Here is a quick synopsis: * Betsy Thoughtless is coming of age. This means she is trying to be independent, but is also in the mist of the courting ritual. * She does not want to pick a suiter because she will no longer be able to play the field. * The man she should marry (Trustworthy) leaves her because he is told she has a bastard child (She really doesn't, she is just helping out another child). * She ends up marrying Mundane. He is a horrible husband. He dies (Trustworthy's wife also dies). * Betsy and Trustworthy end up getting married (as they should have). This book deals with the courtship ritual and how important it was to civilization and women at that time. Note toward the end that Besty had to marry mundane in order to grow up and be worthy of Trustworthy's had in marriage."
2,"Okay, it's very good, but....","I bought this CD with high hopes. I thought maybe it could give me a new perspective on Bach, something I didn't hear in Glenn Gould's two immaculate recordings. It's quite good, excellent playing, but unfortunately, it is decidedly uninspiring when compared to Gould. The technique and phrasing just simply aren't as good by a long shot, and the articulation is so plain. Gould makes every note special in a way Perahia simply can't. Even if he spent every minute for the rest of his life on this music, he couldn't match Gould's sound. If you're buying your first Goldberg Variations, Gould's state of wonder is by far your best choice, and even if you're looking for something new, save your money and listen to Gould again...you'll hear a hundred new things every time you listen that this CD won't give you. So overall, it's very good playing, but belongs in a different category than the Glenn Gould recordings."
2,Don't bother,"If you're expecting Clancy, Brown, or anyone else who can at least write, you'll be disappointed reading this. The plot is initially intriguing, but the situations don't even begin to be believeable."
1,Too Unrealistic - too chintzy -Really poor plot development,"The book started OK -but got really hokey really quickly. The difference between average writers and great writers is that the great ones present the reader with plausible situations that allow ""suspension of disbelief"".Too many ""coincidences"" and ""oh my gosh, look at all the bad things that happened at one time""--really poor development and plot."
1,Gagged me,"Typical dialog: Hero to villain - ""You're a disgrace to your uniform!"" My favorite - ""Don't you think Mariani is a little psychopathic?"" Unless you're the type who reads anything at all that's military (like SAM schematics and the instructions on the back of a box of hand-grenades) please don't waste your time with this book."
1,Horrible! I beg you not to waste your money!,"Calling this a book is perhaps too kind. I use that term only because it is in the physical shape of a book i.e., words arranged on paper bound together with glue.How this 'book' ever got published is beyond me. Maybe Henrick has one of those nasty high-tech guns pointed at the head of the publisher. Why is it so horrible? Let me count the ways: 1. It's poorly written. 2. You don't believe the characters. 3. The situations are ridiculous.If I was one of the people who contributed to this travesty of a 'book' I would ask to have my name removed from the credits.The only reason I kept reading it was for the perverse pleasure of exclaiming, ""Oh my God! Is he kidding? That's the stupidest thing I've ever read!"" Please, for the love of all things good, don't read this book."
1,"Richard, stick with submarines","Having read many of Henrick's now-trite submarine stories, I figured I would give this book a shot (mostly because I got it for free at the library). All I can say is that this book is painful to read, mainly because of poor dialogue. Would anyone really say ""I read that same article, and was impressed by the way all that firepower is delivered on target""? Characters speak mechanically, and conversations read like a reasearch paper. The dialogue is a thinly-veiled attempt at explaining military terms and equipment and really distracts from what might be an interesting story, if written by a more capable author. Maybe Henrick can find a writer to work with so he can concentrate on storyline. P.S. Richard - the ""mad-general plots to assume power"" plot has been beaten to death - try something FRESH."
4,Great Book About Sappers,"This is a well researched and written book. I have it on good authority from the Commanding General that the author of this book spent considerable time with these special troopers and therefore knows of what he speaks. Having trained with them, I can give personal testimony that it is indeed accurate. It helps give some refreshing noteriety and much deserved attention to the elite U.S. Army Sappers. For anyone who knows of the Sappers' reputation this book is interesting and for those who don't, it will surely be the beginning of a life-long interest in learning of these special troops. Even if Sappers don't interest you, it is a great thriller in the same vein as Tom Clancy. Enjoy!!"
4,Kantor's source for his novel,"I got on the track of this book via reading MacKinlay Kantor's _Andersonville._ I had known that Andersonville was bad; I wanted to know how much, if any, of the things in Kantor's book were made up. I found an abridged version of this in the Ames, IA public library, and eventually came across this in the Iowa State University library.John McElroy's account was the main source that Kantor seems to have used for his novel. It reads well, but I would recommend it to those who're seriously interested in Civil War military prisons."
1,pure garbage,"my husband wore these gloves and they rip very easily,the first use and fell apart.i recomend do not buy poor quality trust me!"
2,NOT the same version as available for download.,"This is NOT the same version you can download! The download version is apparantly a ""deluxe"" version, and has much more capabilitiy and fun-factor. The differences--- There are less ""upgrades"" to save up to buy (less kinds of lemonade stands, juicers, ice makers, etc.) and you don't have the ability to hire any staff.I'd recommend either buying it through yahoo or search around google for a free version/code for it until they are willing to sell an equal or better version on CD of what you can download free!My advice, if you/your kids like having more toys/bells and whistles to play with, do NOT buy this version on CD from, you'll be disappointed.All versions are not made equal, and in this case, free is truly better, all the way around."
1,Not the same,"This game is not the same as the free download on Yahoo. Don't waste your money on another Learning Company scheme to deceive the consumer. The game play is slower, with less features as the free version on Yahoo, and there are bugs in it. I called tech support at Learning Company, and what a waste of time that was."
2,It was fun at first.....,"actually, it's less fun than the demo....the ""full version"" has less feature than the demo that i downloaded from yahoo games: less map, less utility to upgrade, can't hire employees........how can this happen?it get's really boring after you did all the upgrades and nothing to change."
1,Good For About Two Minutes,"This game will keep you occupied for about two minutes. Then it get boring.After getting the upgrades (and there are only a few) and going to the different venues, it's just the same thing over and over.I doubt it was worth the $9.00 I paid for it."
4,Relaxing game,I really liked this game because it teaches the basics of business instead of making all the rules complicated. One step at a time learned business rules take a businessman a long way.
1,Not recommended,"Whoever said the CD isn't as fun as the demo is completely right. There are several features in the demo, like many upgrades available to the stand, that aren't included in the real game, which kind of pissed me off. I haven't played it since the first day I bought it because of the features that were left out. I would NOT recommend buying this game, if only because of the deceit of the demo."
2,Boring!,My opinion of this game is that it is for simple minds who find lemonade interesting. it is very boring.
1,Demo= Great! Game= Bad!,"The first time I ever played this game was in March of 2004. I downloaded it off of the internet for free. It was awesome. It had many different places to sell your lemonade, staff you could hire to help out, and many products you could buy that speed up the lemonade making process. I liked it a lot.About a month later, I bought the game. It was terrible. You could not hire help anymore and many of the items and fetures were gone. I thought it was a big waste of money"
1,This game is not the same as the demo,"Amazon.com i hope you will give me a refund because this ame is awful, it has no features like the demo does and is a wastye of money"
3,OK,"I decided to purchase this piece of software, since it was on the discount shelf, and it works on PalmOS... The game is pretty fun, for the first five minutes, after a while it becomes repetitive... It is fun to play on a Palm handheld, while waiting in line though..."
5,THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THE BEST GAME EVER. THE GRAFIXS R WEAK BUT THE OVERALL QUALLITIE OF THE MAKES THE RECOVERIE FOR IT. TAKES A LOT OF SKILL 2 GET A GOOD BUISSENESS RUNING
1,WATA HELL IS THIS ?,"A terrible game that costs $20.00!I plaed this game at my friend's house.Its so BORING.You can buy everything there in 1 week!This game sucks.Not worth the money.should be $5.00.A little secret, by accident I found this out, if u go to that women that helps u sell lemonade, clik hire, and then fire.Sales will go faster.I suggest either u look some where to download the full version (which sucks), or buy it for $20.00!(which also sucks):-)"
1,A waste of money,"When you come across a game like this you wonder how much wasted time the programmer spent on making this game when he could have spent it learning how to program games that worth buying.Do your self a favor and spend your money on rubber bands, you will find that they are a better value and in the long run, more fun than this game."
4,Choose your ride,"I installed these on my 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee 5.9 limited. The result was excellent handling, however, the trade off is a firmer ride than you might want in a luxury vehicle (in 1998!). If firm is what you want, these are a good choice. If you want a more plush ride, consider a different model."
5,Great addition to my Happy Holidays china,Arrived promptly in like new condition. Beautiful. I have wanted this for years and now I have it. Will order another piece later.
5,Very usefull training book,"I have several books on cycling but this is one you can read completely. I mean read not just brouse. I've being carrying it everywhere for two weeks.It helps you understand how your body works, and how to acheive fitness even over 50.If you are starting again in cycling this is a must. you will enjoy it.The only extra book you'll need is one about fixing you bike."
3,Cycling Trainning,"It's a very good book. It teaches you how to deal with data for your trainning. It will be interesting if the author write a book for cyclists that are not interested in competing, but only in enjoing the bike although worried about improvements."
1,Not what I needed,"This might be a good book for someone interested in road racing, centuries, and the such. That ain't me. I was looking for a book to help get back in shape. I found little in this book to help me."
2,Not appropriate,Too generic. Not sufficient information. Too many generalities. This book did not help at all. Cannot even in good faith donate to library.
5,Fitness,"Brilliant book and well done Joe, this book is for everyone. 10/10. This book is easy to follow and that old adage if you fail to plan, you plan to fail."
5,"""I can still feel the sharp wind that greeted us when we crested that ridge."" (p.5)","Beautifully written compendium of advice and help on trail riding and the horses who make it possible. The author writes so well that you can enjoy this book even if you aren't a trail rider; it affords an elegant glimpse into a way of relating to horses that is as old as the equine-human relationship, as new as the latest high-tech GPS. Many extremely helpful photos and illustrations make the advice clear and easy to follow. particularly helpful are the sections on conformation, training, and horse camping. Informed throughout by a love of the horse and a concern for its welfare, this book belongs on the shelf of every serious horseperson. It will make you long to saddle up and head for high country."
1,angel rebelde,for over one year i have called and talked to over half a dozen customer service personnel and informed them that this dvd has no ''ENGLISH SUBTITLES'' and still they are showing it has ENGLISH SUTITLES oh my goodness
1,Very poor....definitley not worth it,I havent seen this novela since it aired so I wanted to watch it again and to my surprise this was a big disappointment. The novela had so many cut out episodes which made it not have any sence....i didnt get how something happened when they skipped the whole thing whih was essential to the program and worse of all there was NOOO ending. It ended as a regular episode...it was horrible....not buying from here again!
2,Meh,"I was disappointed that it wasn't the complete novela. There's only snippets of the chapters, but not the full chapters...it was highly annoying."
5,German Baking at its Best,If you like traditional baking this is the book for you. I am always looking at different kinds of baking books to expand my knowledge and this was an amazing find. True to the german tradition. Anyone wanting to experience this kind of cooking should buy this rare gem.
5,How can an innocent guy get into so much trouble?,I have the first season and am looking forward to watching the second which I just received. The animation is equal to South Park but it is the situationsTim gets into that make this an outstanding low-key comedy feature. Not as graphic as South Park in language a little more low-key centered on the characters each episode rather than satire. This is so different it is hard to compare it to another animated feature.Should have a cult following if it continues to air on TV.
3,"Good collectible, disappointing toy",As a toy this item is disappointing although Star Wars collectors will certainly want to add it to their collection. It's not durable enough to stand up to real play and mine had a piece missing. I wrote the manufacturer for a replacement but had to wait several weeks for it. Realistically this toy is waayyyy overpriced as well.
2,The new Millenium Faclon,This toy was not as well made as its predecessor and it shows. If this was designed as a toy I can only shake my head. It does fine as a collector's type of item where you want to put it together and hang it up or put on a shelf but if you actually try and use this your child will quickly lose the pieces and it will come apart. This will happen withhin the first minutes of playing with it. I am still glad I bought it since I am sure he will still enjoy it so buy this knowing it will not be as playable as it could/should be but it is still playable.
2,PIECE OF JUNK!!! DO NOT BUY!!!,Do not buy this piece of junk. You will waste your money. None of the parts stay together. Everything either breaks or falls off within 5 minutes of putting it together!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!
2,"Great idea, poorly made","We purchased this for my 4 yr old son for Christmas. It took 5 minutes to get it together, and we gave up on the decals. Within 2 minutes, the cockpit door, satellite, gun & seat fell off. The bottom hatch broke off for good. If you're going to just sit and look at this thing, its fine. This has to be one of the worst made toys ever."
2,agree with others,This thing is poorly made and the parts don't fit together very well. The stickers are junkie and the toy in general just isn't well put together.
2,Falls apart easily,"It seems that this toy was never improved upon from the first release. We have the original Millenium Falcon (from the 70's)and the exact same pieces that fell off that ship fall off the brand new one. It hadn't even been played with a day when they started falling off. Very, very poor quality. I expect a lot better quality for an almost $50.00 toy. Our boys (5 & 7) still love it though, especially with the cool sound effects."
1,PLEASE think before you purchase - not a quality item,"Very disappointing toy; poorly made, pieces come off at the slightest of touches - not an enjoyable toy for young children because of the frustration they are having when the pieces keep dropping off.! In addition, the ""seat support"" piece needed to secure several other pieces into the midsection of the ship was missing from our box.Paid 50.00 and is probably worth more like 14.99; please don't buy!"
4,For Display Purposes only,"Only for Millenium Falcon fans..Beware,its only for display with all the figures.."
1,Absolutely horrible and a complete waste of money!,"I spent $40 on this toy and am completely disappointed! The landing gear falls out with the slightest touch, the loading ramp pops off and the hole thing essentially collapses. The top gun turret doesn't stay attached to the seat. My son is a huge Star Wars fan and he doesn't even like this toy. This is inexcusable."
2,Sound doesn't work either,"My 6-yr old son and husband were thoroughly disappointed with this toy. It was the first thing he wanted to play with on Christmas morning - too bad. The mismarked miniscule stickers were nearly impossible to apply and the doors and hinges are rickety. But worst of all, after installng the batteries - no sound. I was going to order another to see if we could get one that works, but after reading the other reviews I've changed my mind. He is happy enough with it the way it is, however defective and over-priced."
5,The Coolest Ship in the Galaxy,"Man this ship is cool! I have it, and it makes laser, highperspeed (I know i didn't spell that right), landing, starting and missle sound effects! It also has a red see-through missle that you can fire with the press of a button! Oh, and when you press the button that fires the missle, it also has a sound effect that goes with it! And it has a landing door, and landing ship kinda legs that help you land it. And, the front landing leg helps you carry it around, but it's not the greatest tool. Also, it has a satelite, cockpit and the guns on the top! I'm telling you man, you really want to get it."
1,Flimsy Piece of Junk,This toy is cheaply made and was not well designed. Parts do not fit snugly and tend to fall off. The support legs collapse under the slightest of pressure or downforce. My son is a big fan of Star Wars and yet even he became frustrated and quickly disinterested in this toy. Don't waste your money.
1,disappointed mom and dad,My 4 1/2 year old son got this for Christmas and it is the biggest and most expencive piece of junk I ever bought!!!!!! I tried to contact Hasbro and complain about this toy but they were closed for Holiday break. I 'll call again after reading all of these reviews. I agree with everyone of them. I'm glad that I'm not the only one who feels this way. My son is so frustrated with this toy everytime he tries to play with it something falls off and I have to crazy glue it back on.(...). Hasbro should be ashamed of themselves for this poor quality and Lucas studios should remove them from being their toy manufacturer!
3,Looks Cool,"My son wanted this toy for Christmas. He is 7 years old. He was impressed with the details, sounds and lights. My younger sons would be able to break this toy and the attachments fairly easily."
1,Piece of Crap!,"We just got home from the store and tried to put the Millennium Falcon together. After doing so, I figured I'd better check reviews to see if I was the only one having problems. Lo and behold, everyone else thinks it's poorly made as well. I will be taking it back to the store. The lights and sounds are neat, but not worth the $$ I wish I would have checked reviews before buying it. Oh well. My 5 year old is very understanding about taking it back."
2,the photos were nice but it broke within a month,"as the title says, the photos werent' bad considering the low quality (great for the web) but it broke within a month"
1,The Little Camera that Couldn't,"You get what you pay for, but in this case it wasn't even what was paid for. VERY cheap camera that is hard to focus and frame a subject. Purchased it for my daughter for her first camera nad it was worthless in teaching her anything about photography."
1,An atrocious laptop,"This laptop is horrendous. About after a year using this, it started to continously shut down spontaneously (usually when running many processes at the same time or a process that takes more CPU). It is also very loud, the speakers are horrible; keep away at all costs!"
2,Max memory limitation - too low,This is a very good package and excellent value.The only and critical downside is that the maximummemory is limited to 512M. This is unacceptablefor this kind of workstation level laptop.
4,Excellent laptop,"Sony Vaio GRV 550 is an excellent laptop with huge 16"" display and 2.4 G processor, it is an ideal desktop replacement."
2,Beatiful screen and keyboard. Awful cooling system,"I got mine in january 2003.... After a couple of weeks using it I had to send it for technical service, due to malfunctioning in burning and connecting to internet.After I got it back It was all perfect, although It is the most noisy laptop I've ever seen, I enjoyed watching DVDs on this great screen.Recently though, It has been turning off suddenly, because it gets extremely hot. I'm Away from the US now.. Service outside the US sucks... I have no idea of how to fix it... I just have been patient enough to wait 20 minutes after it turns off... But I'm definitely buying other brand after this... I'll chek the reviews for an IBM or a DELL. NOT RECOMMENDED"
2,Good / Not so good...,"If you want good desktop replacement, and you live in Alaska, then this laptop is for you. It has a big screen but gets VERY hot (thus Alaska) and poor overall design. NOT RECOMMENDED.Pros:>huge screen>Very fastCons:>battery life (1-1.5 hours)>Desktop processor, not mobile P4: VERY hot and power consumption>extremely noisy (intolerable)>bad speakers>A LOT of junk software, some of which had expired by the time I got the machine.

5,Great children's music!,"This CD is a great addition to any collection of children's music. I was intrigued by the title because I like country music and we have a sizeable collection of Raffi music. It is even better than I anticipated. As much as his songs are enjoyable, listening to Raffi's syrupy voice can get to be too much. This CD is the best of all possible worlds: Raffi songs sung by other musicians. Plus, there were wonderful selections I had not previously heard (five stars for the first number by Asleep at the Wheel)."
5,A joy to listen to!,"Great cd! The songs are definitely geared towards kids, but it's enjoyable for adults as well. Raffi has been an important fixture of my childhood and so hearing his songs in a different light has been a treat. They are easy to sing along to and a wonderful way to boost your mood."
4,Wonderful,"Great music and except for a couple of very marginal artists, very well performed. If this were on vinyl, I'd have to replace it monthly. My daughter has even used it for sing-alongs in her pre-school!"
1,lousy,This album is poor - it just shows that raffi is far better singing his songs than anyone else. Most of the other artists' efforts are really poor - and my kids agree.
4,Very interesting exposé of post-Colonial Africa,"This book is a must-read for anyone interested in African literature or different cultures in general. It's commentaries on both traditional African and contemporary Wester society are very insightful. B is classed by some as a feminist, but this really isn't fair: she merely points out the deplorable ways in which women are treated, and leaves the reader to draw an interpretation. (Definately not a ranting man-hater.)"
3,Une si longue lettre,I was forced to read this book for a summer assignment due on the first day of school but i did not know it would be this interesting i actually enjoyed doing my studies for french
2,"Good Watch,Bad wrist band design",I didn't like the band..They don't make it consumer friendly The band only have a 9mm width. I think they could of made it better design. Overall it's not bad.
4,mcnabb youth jersey,Very happy w/product quality. Shipped right away. Would purchase from seller again.
2,This net is okay for light to med use.,"This net is okay for light to med. use. I use it to remove debris from a koi pond. It's been holding up for a couple of months. I go through lots of nets because of the type of rubbish and branches that end up in the pond. I recommend supporting it with a ""pool noodle""-type of foam padding zip-tied around the metal frame. This has helped a lot. It protects the next where it is affixed."
1,Shockingly lame,"One of the worst things I've read in a long time. The authors apparently haven't read anything except for their own writings in many years, as this ""journal of Marxist politics"" is utterly uninformed by the debates within the international labor and left movements - or even by the occasional reading of a newspaper. I suspect the authors haven't stuck their heads outside their offices in many years. I picked this ""book"" up at a demonstration, where a desperate-looking guy cornered me (it was either buy the book, or get stuck listening to this dude for hours) - but learned later that the purveyors of this literature, in a Larouche-like manner, don't even support the antiwar demonstrations they attend for the purpose of distributing their tracks."
2,"Pretty, but wimpy",I purchased a different frother for my MOM for x-mas from amazon. It worked great and I decided I have to buy one for myself. I saw this one it looked so sleek and stylish compared to the one I bought my mom. I thought that they are all basically the same. I went for style over funtion.It doesn't froth well. It's wimpy wire wisk is hard to clean. The button is too sensitive. I am worried the wire wand is going to snap off. It does look really cool. I love chrome; it has a chrome body and a chrome all metal holder. It doesn't work well at all. Get a frother on amazon that is not as pretty as this one.
2,Uncomfortable,"Es bastante incomodo, el boton hay q mantenerlo apretado para que funcione y cansa el dedo, pues es demasiado pequeño el boton y está entre don esquinas plasticas, voy a comprar otro de 2 velocidades. Lo bueno es su prensentacion, y su stand"
1,This is not it.,"Like another reviewer, this was not the CD I am looking for; nature overpowers here and invades. There is another CD called Tai Chi Sunrise on a different label,Avalon Music that I am looking for."
5,Calming,"I first heard this CD playing in a store at the Mall of America, Minnesota. I was in the store at least 30 minutes and the music was so soothing. I bought it and have used it repeatedly. I take it to work when I know I will be having a particularly stressful day and play it in my pc. I also play it at night if I am having trouble falling asleep. I can't say that one piece is more relaxing then the next. For me, they flow together in a contiuous peaceful stream. This was the first ""meditational"" type cd I had ever purchased."
1,Patronizing,It's a testimonial to how effective leftist indoctrination is in popular culture that this political hack S.T. Joshi who has authored such history books as From Thomas Jefferson to David Duke should apparently be the dominate current editor of H.P. Lovecraft's writings.Many of the books which Joshi has edited actually carries warnings of the quaint antique datedness of the contents to be read with the condescending superiority that an assumed left/liberal urban professorate can bestow on reactionary trifles.This dichotomy between an academic's doctrinaire loyalties and marketing results in Joshi's schizophrenic editing. A finicky apologetic mess.Joshi is symptomatic of the congealing imagination as the ivy league disgorges it's post-modern generation into publishing. Lovecraft and company deserve better.
3,one star for each week it worked quiet,"I gave it five stars at the first week it worked, and now give one star for each week it worked quiet. Yes. it sounds like a school bus now. I'll never buy an airconditioner from Panasonic again."
2,Spend your money elsewhere,"Well written, but the vast number of inaccuracies and unfounded rumors make this book almost worthless. Author notes that Nesmith's Colpix 45s never went beyond promotional pressings (wrong!), the cereal box records featured songs years before their ""official"" release (wrong! the cereal box records came out in 1969/70), Charles Manson tried out for the Monkees (wrong Wrong WRONG!) etc, etc. The discography section is also essentially worthless (and VERY outdated).Simply put...if you want to know the story behind The Monkees, you would be MUCH better off reading either Davy or Micky's autobiography, or the excellent book by Maggie McManus & Ed Reilly ""A Manufactured Image""."
4,The tale of the Monkees,"Lefcowitz sheds light on lesser known details regarding each of the guys, as well as covering the highlights (and lowlights) in their personal lives and their collective and individual careers. An enlightening look into the lives of the first video pop stars."
3,Hey hey they're the Monkees!,"If you love the Monkees, this is the book for you. It's got accurate information, and if you're a picture nut like me, it's got great pictures to look at!"
4,Hoping it's a good one...,"I've skimmed through Monkeemania: The Story of the Monkees and am hoping to find Monkees Tale by Lefcowitz in a store near me! And it's funny how a reader who reviewed this book is from Beavertown, PA, where Davy Jones currently lives.. Isn't that weird? ;)---*doreen*---"
5,Well worth your time and money,"I highly recommend this film. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would give it 6 stars if I could just for the subject matter. For a short documentary this covers a lot of great territory. It is informative, humorous and entertaining.One of my friends couldn't relate to it. He has never been passionate about any sport and can't remember when he wasn't ""out"". Good for him. However, many LGBT people have difficulties while trying to overcome stereotypes, fears and prejudices both in themselves and in others. Coming out, in part, is about forging an open, honest and integrated life.This movie seems to be about just that; forging an integrated life. For LGBT people who either grew up playing ""straight"" in sports, or who picked up sports after coming out, this is their story. An integrated life; with all the passion of sports and with people who accept you scrapes bruises and all, it is awesome."
4,Good weight. Feel well made,"I bought this set to work on some Macs and other random projects that require Torx bits. It worked for the job of the moment, and now I'll have them for the future. I had previously bought a set from the local Micro Center for about $5, but the construction was so poor that the bits actually crumbled while doing my last project (hard drive swapout in a Macbook Pro). This disassembled and reassembled an iMac without a hitch. Nothing beats having the right tool for the job."
4,Good Reference,I was impressed with the book and the DVD. As a novice to engine building I was able to follow the DVD and book with relative ease. There were a few areas of the process that are in the book that the DVD did not mention. Overall I think it is a very good tool for the novice like myself.
4,"Informational SBC Book, For Me.","Like my review of another SBC book, I purchased this book prior to buying my SBC engine, eventually a V8 283. I flipped through it, pretty much clueless. Anyway, I picked up an engine; the guy I bought it from was kind enough to start building it for me.This book, for me, is informational. It gives additional detail(s) that is needed, plus, it came with a DVD. The DVD seems to contain everything from start to finish of engine building. I have been able to gather the information I need to build a respectale 283 engine with some horsepower. Some areas of this book have been highlighted by me more than others but, again, I'm building a 283.To supplement the info in this book, I also, purchasedHow to Rebuild Your Small-Block Chevy (Paperback), which is another good book to have in your garage or shop."
3,Disappointing,"La Grande Illusion is one of the greatest films of the 20th century and, if you enjoyed the movie, you might like this CD. Like Hitchcock and Herrmann or Spielberg and Williams, the collaboration of filmmaker Jean Renoir and composer Joseph Kosma deserves serious attention. This CD, unfortunately, does a disservice to both artists. The soundtrack is lifted directly from the film; dialogue and sound effects obscure Kosma's music. In addition, the liner notes provide a useful filmography of Kosma's career but little else. Kosma scored over 100 films between 1936 and 1971 and is as important to French cinema as Alfred Newman, Franz Waxman, Miklos Rozsa, or Erich Wolfgang Korngold are to American film. Surely a better treatment of Kosma's work than this is possible."
5,A beautiful story- masterfully told,"By blending family footage with crude yet incredibly affecting special effects, Oxenberg has created a funny, poignant movie unlike any other. This is a must-see !!"
3,What you see is not what you get,"I received a 6 cup jumbo muffin pan and the cups are the same size as the one I ordered, but the pan does not have the large grip edges and looks substantially different. I went to the Norpro website and could not find the one pictured on the Amazon website, but I did find the one I received (Norpro item #3932, made in China) and there are 6 on Amazon for about $6.00 less than what I paid (maybe people are sending them back for not receiving the one they ordered). Also, the label on the muffin pan states ""Easy clean Durable Nonstick Recipe Included"", but there was nothing else in the box except bubble packing (no invoice or packing slip either). Regardless, my old muffin pan needed to go in the trash and I don't want to be without one so I'll keep the one I received and it will probably cook and clean just as good as the one I ordered."
3,Bruce makes it good,"that hans dudes stuff is pretty good, but bruce hornsby's tunes are the best part of it. Bruce steals the show with his tracks"
5,From a member of a Firefighting family,"As my ALL TIME FAVORITE COMPOSER, Hans Zimmer has writen a truly moving tribute to all firefighters. All the men on My moms side are firefighters, and every one of them had liked this score, especually ""Fighting 17th."" The score brings tears to my eyes when I listen to it. I love how Zimmer is able to bring out the emotion that is in firefighting. My favorite track is ""Burn It All,"" Which is Zimmer's best action cue. Also, the finale is brilliant and inspiring. The songs are distracting, but luckily don't interupt the flow of the score. GREAT JOB MR.ZIMMER!"
4,The Iron Chef music,"If you find the Iron Chef music stirring, this is where it came from - and the album is pretty impressive."
4,Easy to read,"This book is easy to read. It is about taking a wrong turn in life and where it leads, then eventually coming back around again. There is lots of suspense."
5,Available,"I agree with all the reviews. Wonderful show with great acting. I actually found an individual who had taped all 81 episodes (some never seen on TV). I don't remember the person who did it, but while browsing Google, I found the following URL: [...] . I can't vouch for the DVDs because I bought mine elsewhere, but it advertizes availability of all 81 episodes. Just trying to be helpful. Well, I can see that my address got deleted by Amazon. Go figure."
5,Public Outcry for Boston public!,"This is a singularly spectacular show, and way too much time is being taken getting all its seasons on DVD. The story lines were always quirky and entertaining and usually delivered thought-provoking, emotional responses in every episode. Always there was something hysterically funny and far-fetched, and the challenge of substantial story-telling with provactive and compelling performances from such a talented and diverse cast is why this show ought to be available on DVD. Not that it was perpetually perfect--it did reach at times and get smarmy, but that is often the case in high school life. It is in that same ""rare gem"" category as ""Thirtysomething""--which also should be released on DVD!! I want it NOW, if not sooner. ""SMELL that shoe!!!"""
5,Everything I expected and more,"This book was very up front and helpful in its' approach. The personal and biblical application was very clear and encouraging. How helpful to see that not only has God provided us guidelines in His word, but also in life today.The author gives a caring approach to the difficult item of criticism.MOst importantly,he allows each reader to see the problem with listening to this type of speech. To deny its' important factors is to admit your own blindness to gossip(as many people do).Dr. Sedler is honest in his sharing of what is going to tell us in his book and specific methods of helping each of us. It is evident that he was a teacher and knows how to get his point across.If you want to read a book that allows you to lie to yourself and remain in sin...This is not that book.But, if you want a book that brings truth, freedom and encouragement...BUY THIS BOOK."
1,This Gun could not be any worse!!,"I had hours and hours of fun with this gun.....beating it on the sidewalk. I had more fun playing with the box. The first day I got it my charger broke, the back fell off, the semi-auto broke, the spring in the clip broke, it jams, the accuracy is god awful, the only way you could actually inflict pain on someone let alone hit them is shoving it up their ass or down their throat. The COCKing mechanism is horrible you shake it for about 1 minute and shoot 8 shots. DONT BUY THIS[...]"
2,"You are stupid if you think this gun is good for anything but wallhanging,","This gun SUCKS. It shoots 10 yards (30 feet) and it's ROF is 120 RPS. My friend was trying to give me supressing fire while I flanked the enemy position with my assault team and he was outgunned by a $20 springer. All in all, just get the XL AK47 or something like that if you want a good gun, but if you like the M16/A15 then just get something else."
1,crap,"dont buy this. it is a piece of crap. i was using it for plinking and its still horrible. the clip holds 18 and then u have to take it out and shake it witch takes forever to reload. buy a better gun, u will be disapointed with this!!!"
3,What can you expect for 30 dollars?,"Pretty much a toy gun. The scope is a joke. And it is definitely NOT a full-scale model of the M4. It's about two thirds the size of the real thing. The battery failed within a few days because the ""full charge"" indicator didn't work, so the battery got overcharged.If you're even somewhat serious about getting an airsoft gun, then spend a few extra bucks and get a decent one. You pretty much get what you pay for."
2,AirSplat M4A1 Laser Airsoft,"The gun was a disappointment. After one day of use, the automatic loader broke. The laser couldn't attach and the directions were very sketchy. ON THE OTHERHAND, the supplier was very cooperative about trying to assist with repair and verbally talking through laser installation. In the end, it was too much of a hassle to return and we replaced with one bought locally."
2,Horrible Gun,This gun is horrible. The scope is a pain to put on and its Completly inaccurate. The directions for the gun are also horrible. They just give you pictures and expect you to put it together. Well you get what you paid for. If you really want an airsoft gun you should go to another web site to order another gun because this gun is made in China and they make cheap guns (im sorry but thats not racisim)
1,JLS Boys M4A1 Laser Electric Airsoft Machine Gun,"My son paid for this horrible gun himself. He will probably never buy anything off of the internet the rest of his life. The directions were horrible (for putting the gun togeather). When we finaly got it togeather, he took it outside, and shot it one time before it broke. The gun is made of cheap plastic, the infra red does not stay attached, the battery that comes with it said not intended for use with this gun. Horrible product."
1,didnt even come with the red dot sight and lazer oh and the magazine didnt work,did not come with lazer light or the red dot sight or the foregrip. btw the magazine didnt even work.
2,For the love of God No!!!,This thing is horrible! Not so much that it breaks (though mine did because my Dad stepped on it but that should'nt affect you decision) it shoots about 70 fps (no kidding) and like those other guys said its a pain to load and only gt like 3-5 rounds and shure isn't accuret (nore is my spelling either). but the battery dose last long and thats when the goodness ends. Other wise its all suck.
4,imaginative entertainment,all the family members (teens also!!) enjoy listening on our family reunion trip
3,"Really good, until","Very excited about the FOTF version of Narnia. Read a lot about it. Have only listened to the first book (Magician's Nephew) and it is really, really, really good until ... you get to Aslan's voice! Augh! The actor is so stilted. There is no rhythm or meter to his reading. It's almost painful to listen to.It saddens me to write this review, and for $20 it's still worth it, but this could have been PERFECT if Aslan's voice had been done better by a more competent voice actor. I hope the rest of the books are better than the first!"
5,The Chronicals of Narnia,"This is a great set, it's one of the best audio books I have ever heard. It has various actors playing each of the characters, music, and sounds that match the story perfectly. It's a must for anyone who loves childrens' books."
1,We had to stop listening,"This version of Narnia has everything going for it. Music, Sound Effects, Great Voices and a Great Story. Unfortunately the voice of Aslan is the worst! Sorry to say that it ruined it for my wife and I. If not for Aslan this would be top class. If you are able to listen to him speak before buying please do."
5,Outstanding,"I received this set as a Christmas present, and listened to the CD's back to back. If you listen to them in a quiet place, with your eyes closed, it is ALMOST like being there. I can't think of anything more I could ask. The only disapointment was the voice of Aslan. It was overdone to the point of ludicracy, and I found myself having to laugh several times. You simply cannot make solemn pronouncements using a voice that sounds like that. Everything was spoken far too slowly, and I kept just wishing he'd get on with it and SAY whatever he was trying to. Overal I quite enjoyed listening to these CD's."
5,I give it 10 stars**********,"Wow, the radio theater did a great job bringing to life one of my all time favorite series of books. The acting is superb and the action well-paced. The biographical information from C.S. Lewis' step-son was icing on the cake. I took this series on a trip out west and it kept my kids quiet for hours (a real plus when you are driving a rental van through the mountains). The only beef I have (and it is small) is that the series follows the new order of the books instead of the original. But since I can play them in any order I want, who cares?"
5,Outstanding!,"Even if you have read the Chronicles of Naria, this live theatrical production and dramatation is more vivid than watching the movies (as good as they are)that have recently been released. The symbolism and metaphor that brings home the Biblical world view has been amazingly accomplished by C.S. Lewis. All of the characters of his amazing imagination are brought to like in the full color of your imagination in this great adaptation put out by Focus on the Family. You will not be disappointed."
5,Amazing Stories!,"My siblings and I received these CDs as a gift many Christmases ago, and we had loved listening to them ever since. Even though I'm older now, I still enjoy hearing the classic tales of Narnia come to life. Focus on the Family did a phenomenal job in creating these stories! Highly recommended!!"
5,great stuff,I enjoy C. S. Lewis..... this medium allows the kids to share in the many joys of his work.....The cast is amazing and entertainment level is stunning....
3,Fine but scares the 7 yr old,"This is a good collection, but scared by 7 yr old who does not like the dark, being alone, and is afraid of most of disney. My 9 year old did like it, so gave it a 3. If you do have a child that is not afraid of such things it is a good collection from what we have heard"
3,Good for a long ride in the car,"The whole family enjoyed listening to the books, but the voice of Aslan is awful to the point of distraction."
5,The wonderful world of Narnia,"The audio version of Narnia is one of my favorite things :). I have found that several ages enjoy them, not only children, my whole family has listened to them several times, and I even took them to work and my co-workers listened to them. They probably would be some what scary for young children.Aslan the lion in this book is such a wonderful picture of Jesus, I have come to love Him more, such wonderful analogizes, that challenge you and cause you to think about life. The only complaint I would have is that some times I think Aslan's voice is a little silly, not quite deep enough, but that's my only complaint."
5,My kids love it,"My son loved them We have a long drive to Grandma's and these are great to fill time in the car. The dramas are well done, and more interesting to listen to than one person reading the whole story."
5,Amazing Story Conveyed with Clarity,"Everyone loves the Chronicles of Narnia. Perhaps for the action. Perhaps for the intrigue. Perhaps for the meaning of the stories.These audiobooks bring it alive. With complete voice casts and sound effects along with a beautiful musical score, this is the next best thing to living in Narnia.Recommended for all age groups. As a teenager in high school, I started driving last year and I have enjoyed driving around with this set in the car."
5,A Must-Have in Your Audiobook Collection!,"This is a bargain, considering the price of this specific product. Each book is produced with great actors and sounds which bring you into the full Narnia experience. I was really proud of the work Focus on the Family put into these stories. Every dialog with Aslan is particularly expertly executed. They did a marvelous job at capturing and highlighting the themes C.S. Lewis wrote into each book. To make things more clear, this specific collection of the seven Narnia stories has a little less fancy packaging than the other collection offered by Amazon. I believe this is what makes the difference in pricing between the two, and even though it's not as nice, I still think this is the better deal because you get the same CD's for less of a hit on your wallet and still in a decent little box to keep your books in order."
5,Outstanding! For a more detailed description read Cindy's review...,"This version is SO WELL DONE!As well as I know the Chronicles of Narnia, I'm caught up in the action again and again. This is a steal at $20 !!!"
5,Magnificent Maglite,"I had previously owned a Maglite and knew how dependable they were. It was really a no-brainer when selecting a new flashlight, when mine was stolen out of my car. I would definitely recommend this to anyone."
2,Slightly Disappointed,"I loved this Jeep & my daughter did too when she opened it. But after a short time, everything starts coming apart. The windshield & roll bar foll off if you just tug on them. The glove compartment lid pops off all the time, and the seat belts are worthless! I know it's [cheap]...but it's a fairly useless toy. My daughter gets upset everytime the car falls apart--which is everytime she's playing with it! My daughter is gentle with her barbies & this car, so it's just not a durable toy. Spend the couple of extra bucks & get the VW Beetle car, mini-van, or Volvo Barbie Cars. They're much durable & won't frustrate your child!!"
2,Pick a Different Vehicle.,"This jeep isnt so hot! Cute at first glance, but the rollbar was the first to fall off....followed by just about everything else. Also want to mention it's hard to position the dolls in the car. Not too roomy.There are so many other Barbie vehicles on the market. I'd save yourself the disappointment and choose another."
1,Pitiful little spray,"I was very excited to get this for my 4-year-old son, and when it came he slept with it for 3 nights. When there was finally enough sun to go outside and get wet in the spray, we were very excited. I hooked it up to the hose and turned on the water. After we were sure that the water was going and all the kinks were out of the hose, we both just stood there and stared. It came out in drips and drabs only and the ears never made it up much less go around. The flowerpot did pop up enough to send out some spray, but it was only enough to go up to my son's ankles. Some may say that it could have been my water pressure, but I have my doubts since I have run lawn sprinklers just fine previously. Needless to say, this toy lost its appeal and is now sitting in the garage. I would not recommend this toy for any summer fun in the sun."
3,Ears don't spin,"I tried two of these sprinklers. With the first, the ears did not spin at all. With the second, one ear spins while the other doesn't and instead sprays straight to the ground creating quite a soggy area. I haven't decided if I will take this one back. Also the pot of flowers don't rise enough for one to notice."
1,Where's the spin?,"Both of my kids received this as a birthday gift (different years)- took one back and sold the other in a garage sale. The ears did not spin very much, and the stream that came out of them was pretty weak. The sprinkler is a lot more fun."
3,Waste of money,This item did not do what it promised. The ears had to be restarted every few minutes. I called Fisher Price and they admitted that it was not good. They suggested we return it to the store for a refund because they could not replace it. They also advised not to buy the Elmo 1-2-3 sprinkler.
3,Cute toy.,"Blue's Clues sprinkler is a cute and colorful toy, but ...the ears don't spin very well (or at all sometimes)which is one of the main selling points. A basic lawn sprinkler is still more popular with my kids."
2,Painfully slow moving films,"Even at 6.99 this is too much. These movies are 80;s slashers, which I enjoy usually. Unfortunately they go VERY slow and the picture isn't all that great either. They're filled with cheesy music and lame effects. I found it hard to keep my eyes open during both films. BORING!"
5,MAGNIFICANT BEYOND MAGNIFICANT!,"WOW! WHAT A WAY TO CLOSE THE SERIES. GODZILLA AND DON ""THE PREDATOR"" FRYE ROCK HARDCORE BABY! EVERY MONSTER IN TOHO HISTORY EXCEPT GOROSAURAUS, UNFORTUNATELY, EVEN HEDORAH, AND EBERAH SHOW UP. ALL ACTION ALL THE TIME. ITS LIKE EVERY SCIENCE FICTION ENTITY THAT I LOVE ALL ROLLED INTO ONE FILM. V, STAR TREK, STAR WARS, POWER RANGERS, EVEN GIJOE. WHAT A MOVIE. I HAD A HARD TIME BELIEVING REPORTS ABOUT THIS BEING THE BEST OF ALL. BUT IT REALLY WAS. ""2 THINGS YOU FORGOT ABOUT THIS PLANET, ONE OF THEM IS ME. THE OTHER IS GODZILLA"" GODZILLA FOREVER!"
4,Two Godzillas for the price of One!,"I should probably give this 4 and 1/2 stars. Some of the characters are a bit derivative but the action ramps up and just keeps going. What does my title mean? After 2 viewings it occurred to me that Don Frye's character of Capt. Gordon is the human incarnation of the Big ""G"": a foreign monster who just won't stop. Fortunately for the Japanese, this monster is on their side. In one scene, Gordon looks at the oncoming monster and states that: ""He just won't stop."" There is a very understated admiration and recognition of a kindred soul in that statement. I also got a big grin out of the surviviors' discussion around the table as to what they need to do to win the war. Gordon minces no words and everyone just has to swallow a very big pill if they want to defeat the aliens. Don Frye has a wonderful supporting role in the new Dillinger movie. Doesn't say much, but every word counts."
5,Great to pay homage of 50 years of our favorite monster,"This movie is really great. It shows godzilla as what he is, the king of the monsters. This is my kind of godzilla movie. Rock & techno music (I wish they could get bands like metallica,megadeth,iron maiden, ect),Humans aren't boring and do some matrix style fighting,a cool american,clasic monsters, godzilla beating the tire out of monsters with no effort whale still having a challenge at the end, gigan's chainsaw arms,anguirus's thunderball attack, and lots of other things. One thing I find very Hypocritical of the g-fandom on this movie is when they complain of not that much monster action. I can name off several kaiju movies that have less monster action then this movie and is still well loved. Here are a few.Destroy all monstersgamera 3: revenge of irisGodzilla vs. mechagodzilla 74Terror of mechagodzillaGodzilla raids againGodzilla king of the monstersThe daimajin moviesGodzilla vs. monster zerorodanmothraI rest my case your honor."
3,Too much people time not enough Monster time.,"This could have been a great movie for me if it was scripted different. All the monsters were cool. However, too much time was given to the scenes with people and not enough to the monsters. If there was about fifteen minutes less people time and instead fifteen minutes added to the monster scenes it would have been cooler. Also I would have liked to see the monsters put up more of a fight. Godzilla tears through them like Oprah at a buffet. A cooler ending would have been Rodan, Caesar and Anguirus coming to godzilla and Mothra's aid against Gigan and Ghidorah in a all out donnybrook. I still enjoyed the movie in general. This one is a good addition to your collection."
3,Too Much Alien,"Godzilla is always a hoot, but you don't see enough of him in this movie to hoot much. He's literally ""put on ice"" within the first ten minutes, then, in the last half-hour of the movie, he's broken out by the same people who put him there to fight off a variety of monters unleashed on the world by invading aliens who want our mitochondria for food. It is great fun to see him quickly dispose of said monsters, particularly the ""American Godzilla"". The traditional Godzilla theme music is heard only in the opening title; the rest is techno-pop and generally pretty poor, except for the climactic final scene.The intervening sixty minutes is spent unveiling the alien plot and how a special group of mutants attempts to thwart it. Way too much Matrix-style fighting.The bulk of the movie is a series of rapid scene cuts; seriously overdone and ultimately annoying.Generally a fair Godzilla movie, and not what I might have hoped for as the fire-lizard's swan song."
3,"Not the best film, not the better edition...","... but a good movie to have fun with King-G. Just an extra docummentary, but Japanese language still on the DVD. A relief."
3,We want more.............,"Im a big godzilla fan, and this is suppose to be the last godzilla movie for a while, well they should make anotherone to correct mistakes from this one. This godzilla movie...updatedprobably for the new generation does no justice. Its really aMatrix movie with Godzilla instead of the other way around.The pace, the monsters are better than their predecessor's butthe movie itself looses the feeling a bit.Must be seen if you are a fan, enjoy."
2,Seen this Before,"1st im the biggest godzilla fan, ever since i was a kid. This movie was just bad. Horrible acting even for a godzilla movie. This movie is such a blatant rip off of the matrix and independence day. You actually feel like your flipping through the channels and watching a couple of different movies while your watching this one. Its such a shame that this is the last godzilla movie for the next 10 years they should have ended with giant monsters all out attack a way better movie. But of course being a godzilla fan you have to complete the set. But i have to admit this really tested my love for godzilla. i will admit it was good seeing all the monsters even though some you could tell they barely gave any thought about upgrading their look."
2,Oh no!! This is Godzilla's 50th anniversary movie?,"What have they done??? I would of preferred Godzilla versing one ultimate monster or just by himself than watch this. I really wanted to like this movie but there is just so many things wrong with it I just couldn't. The battles are too short one minute if lucky some lasting only 15 seconds. The only battle worth watching is Godzilla vs. Monster X. I don't know why they put that Matrix crap in it that was just a complete waste it was soo boring and when could humans beat a giant monster (Ebriah) with a few guns? This is just a horrible movie to finish off Godzilla, if they concentrated more on the monsters than the already ridiculous plot it would of been much more fun."
2,Perfect...for a six year old,"I bought this as a birthday gift for my six year old son. He loves Godzilla so I thought I'd get this dvd for him as one of his gifts. I think the movie had a bit too much hand to hand Matrix-style crap which is OLD. Seeing all the different monsters got him excited while his mother was sound asleep from the lame script. LOL.This movie didn't feel like it had enough Godzilla and that Minilla monster was the silliest thing I ever seen. After THIS movie, please don't knock the American Godzilla as I think it was seriously underrated. All Monsters Attack Out was far better than this.My son normally says ""Let's see it again!"" after seeing something he likes but he didn't say anything about this movie except to copy the movie scenes with his toy monsters. I wonder if he'll write a better script too?"
2,Bad ending for the King of Monsters,"Purposively this is the last installment of the 50 year Godzilla series. Which is disappointing enough in itself, but this one fails to deliver a good ending. It seems as if the director thought it was more important to emulate Hong Kong action/fighting flicks than make a ""Giant Monster"" movie full of mass destruction and maybe even a have a point to it (as did the original '54 version, the Smog monster, and few others). Somebody should have taken a clue from the latest Gamera series: make a movie that works for both kids and adults that entertains, is exiting, and doesn't insult the audience. Some good scenes here and there, but over all it feels disjointed and uninspired."
4,The final battle,"I had been waiting for this movie to come out for a year, but it seemed to be forever for me. So when I first saw it on the shelves, I was ecstatic and ran to get my Mom. We rented it, but she had to watch it first. Warning: All kids under thirteen, you will probably not get to watch this movie alone. There's an extreme amount of language all throughout the movie, so don't get your hopes up. This movie is good and for the first time the ACTORS are good. the story's very good as well. Minila is back and he's still very strange. The very last line in this movie is ""It's just the beginning."" So you can tell that in a few years, Toho will hire the big G again. I can't wait."
1,Godzilla meets the Matrix meets the Power Rangers,"This is definitely the worst Godzilla movie in the last 25 years. This one is definitely aimed at teenyboppers who grew up on The Matrix and Power Rangers. Real Godzilla fans would be advised to stay away. Spend your money on the new collection coming out with Gojira and Godzilla, King of The Monsters this summer."
5,We'll Miss You Big G,"I love all of the Godzilla movies except yes Godzilla's Revenge I own every single movie on DVD and or VHS so of course I was excited about the final send off knowing this is it for a long time. This was typical Godzilla fashion he is imobile for a good part of the movie but when he does awake he does his thing and that's stomps monster but and seeing all the old monsters who have given him so many battles stand in his way with the world in ruins was great Gigan was welcome sight, and the Monster X transformation was sweet. I wish like most that the battles lasted longer, anyway if you are a fan of Godzilla I recommend this it's been a fun ride here's to the future of Godzilla."
4,My Review,The Computer-Generated monsters are a little fast for their size but the story is great and the acting is excellent! I wish that the monster fights were a little longer but overall- as a godzilla fan - I find this movie to great.
4,It May Be A War --- But It's Not Final!!!!!!,"An interesting departure from all prior entries in the 50-year, 28-film extravaganza of the visionary Godzilla chroncicles from Japan's reknowned Toho Studios. Aficianados of Asian Daikaiju films will likely be attracted to its rapid-fire approach to contiguous scenes, and increased use of CGI technology in the depiction of classic Toho monstrosities. The downside of this film lies primarily in the overemphasis on human-to-human combat, which sometimes detracts from the central struggle played out by Godzilla and his gigantic opponents. Also, the English language overdubbing is extremely poor throughout; the film must be heard in Japanese."
3,Actually this is very interesting version of Godzilla....,"I bought this for my son, who loves Godzilla. Out of all the B movie Godzillas, this one is very interesting. What I like is the martial arts moves of the characters and the music. Yes, there are really cheesy parts but that is what Godzilla series has always been. For kids that love Godzilla, this one is a good choice!"
1,Godzilla- Final Matrix/Star Wars,"How could Ryuhei Kitamura make a Godzilla movie so completely uninspired? This film reeks of Hollywood plagerism, assuming entire Matrix/Neo characters and scenes, albeit laughingly so. Amazingly, even Star Wars fans will recognize their favorite scenes incorporated into this mish mash of previously done Sci Fi adventures.All of this could even have been overlooked, had only the monsters been inspired. Consider perhaps actual scenes of them more than just haphazardly spliced in, because, well, it was supposed to be a monster movie. I don't remember Godzilla even giving his signature roar until the movie's end. See G vs.Megaguirus for an example of an inspired monster movie. Less silly people and aliens, more of what fans want--monsters."
2,One of worst Gozilla movies ever,"This has to be one of the worst Godzilla movies in the series. I am one of those old-school fans where the action was well paced. This movie is really an action movie and not a monster movie. They rip off the Matrix in several places with over-the-top stunts. The main villian is just goofy and cheesy with his fits when the monsters lose. The plot is horrible, the acting is the cheesiest I have ever seen, godzilla doesn't even really show up until the end. Then they just throw in every monster they could think of to finish off their stories. If you really like the power rangers then you will like this film. This movie would really appeal to 10-15 year olds which is where all the good ratings are coming from. I don't consider this part of the Godzilla series."
3,"not the worst, but certainly the weirdest!","As most fans of the Godzilla series know, the star of the movie is Godzilla.... the aliens are the supporting cast. Not in this movie! Other than the opening sequence, it takes quite awhile for Big G to appear!While not completely dumb, one watching the movie gets the idea that it drags on and on. The appearance of the American Godzilla and seeing some of the classic Japanese monsters with upgrades makes for an interesting show. Unless you need this movie for your complete Godzilla collection, my advice is to just rent it."
3,SUBTITLED,"This one is also in Japanese, with English subtitles. The best parts of the movie are when all of the classic monsters emerge, but the rest of it is cheap sci-fi nonsense. I gave it an ok because most all of the original monsters are in it, with their original sounds."
3,A TRUE GODZILLA FAN!,"OK LISTEN I LOVE GODZILLA MOVIES, AND HAVE BEEN A DIE HARD FAN SINCE I WAS A LITTLE KID. BUT THIS LAST MOVIE...WELL? IT WASN'T VERY GOOD! IF YOU'RE THINKING IT'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER GODZILLA 2000 YOU ARE VERRRRY WRONG! TRUE GODZILLA FANS LOVE ACTION, AND CORNY COSTUMES. NOT COMPUTER ANITMATED CREATURES AND SUPER HUMAN PEOPLE (wich was what the movie was mainly about). I WAS REALLY DISAPOINTED IN THIS MOVIE AND I HOPE IT ISN'T THE LAST. BUT IF YOU'RE A FAN...WELL? YOU MIGHT AS WELL GET IT OR WATCH IT.DAVID"
3,Disappointing to say the least...,"I was really excited about getting this flick. As was my 11 year old monster fan son. After watching it, we were sadly disappointed. What the hell was all that Matrix rip-off stuff? I don't want a lot of cheesy dialogue and people fighting in my Godzilla movies. Especially when you're bringing together some of the greatest monsters of the series. It's a freaking Godzilla movie, for crying out loud! All that other stuff was lame, boring and completely inane. Give me a Godzilla movie that's about Godzilla, not those ridiculous storylines about aliens and monster fighting Matrix-wannabe BS.The parts with the monsters were great. This flick desperately needed a whole hell of a lot more of those moments."
2,Disappionted Finale,"Movie was loaded with lots of monsters (including the US Godzilla), but battles were too short. Stole a lot of elements from other movies, should have done a much better job for the ""final"" Godzilla movie."
2,Not so good,"I recently rented this video, and I was disappointed. The effects are generally really good, but there is such a clear influence of Anime on this film, as well as cheap TV shows like Power Rangers. For example, there are many scenes in which the monsters are running, and it looks like the stuff came right out of a Power Rangers battle. Likewise, the music is very ""modern"" -- lots of electric guitar -- rather than a more traditional Godzilla score. Worst of all, the human ""mutants"" are very much stylized to look like Anime characters, right down to their hair styles. It was cool to see a few of the monsters in action again, but overall I didn't think this film did them justice."
5,GODZILLA FINAL WARS,Excellent delivery service and well packaged. I actually gave the film away as a gift. Pleased overall with this and would certainly recommend other shoppers to you.
3,More Power Ranger/Matrix than Godzilla,"If you could separate the two stories. The human vs. alien vs. monster vs. monster. Get the picture. The actual Godzilla fighting scenes were minimal. Most monsters found their arses handed to them in a matter of minutes. The movie centered mainly on the human versus alien conflict. Lots of ""thuggy"" characters fighting macho characters ... mix and match in cheap Matrix like fashion.This could have been really good ... but sadly it fell short. I didn't hate the movie. It is worth seeing as a rental, but buying it may be to much a push. Power Rangers go!"
1,Sad ending to this cycle of films,"This is one of those films that only somone who has either watched too much MTV or sufferes from ADD would enjoy. It really has no direction and cannot figure out what type of movie it wants to be. The soundtrack is a mess and has none of the character and class of any of the older Godzilla movies. The battle scenes are at times pathetic and not well thought out. Maybe those in the 13-20 age group will find this movie entertaining. Real monster movie fans will find it a poor effort.The Japanese have said Godzilla will be back in 2013, lets hope they learn to do better than Godzilla Final Wars by then.. Watch only if you do not have anything better to do or have VERY low standards in moviemaking. Watch a clasic Godzilla film instead."
2,"Martial Arts, not Godzilla","I own all Godzilla movies and luv 'em for their simple plots, monsters, uncomplicated human relationships, etc. But this one does not follow that format. This is more of a martial arts movie complete with sneers, fighting poses, and impossible flying acrobatics. And the women, despite all the battles, running, fighting....they always have immaculate shiny lipstick and great hair (the TV lady has great legs!) Godzilla et al seem to be thrown in there as a subplot. I watch my Godzilla movies over and over but this is one of my least favorite."
2,Disappointing,"This is the worst of the Godzilla 2000 series. I was extremely disappointed. I've tolerated bad Godzilla movies for years because I'm a Godzilla fan but this one pushes the limit.Let's admit it, there isn't one Godzilla movie that rises above the ""B movie"" status. Some are close, but there's always a crack somewhere that gives it away. Fans look past the bad costumes, poor translation, and ridiculous plots. If you ARE a Godzilla fan, you are obligated to see even this movie. I suggest renting it though.It suffers from loooooong people fights, short monster fights, and too much talking. The whole Matrix meets Godzilla combination bored me to tears. My son even got bored and stopped watching it."
2,I really want to give it one and a half stars,"I dont know what really to say except...if u like MIGHTY MORPHINE POWER RANGERS then this movie is for u...It truely was a bad movie...I feel sorry that Godzilla has to end like this...I was so excited when i first here about this movie. Boy was I sold a load of crap...If this is a fine example of Japanese movie making, I can see why they like American movies so much. If u r a godzilla fan, u know u are going to see...u will sit there an keep tellin yourself that it is good just to fight the bad reviews...But in the end u are going to be like the rest of us n say...I want my 2 hours of my life back."
1,Exit with a whimper,"This remarkably lame entry into the Godzilla franchise apparently marks the end of the second run of movies, and it slams the door shut with a resounding thud. The last several movies were excellent, particularly Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack, which marked the return of the evil, scary Godzilla. Final Wars is a lame pastiche of The Matix and X-Men, framed with relatively stingy Kaiju battle scenes. While the idea of the Kaiju Godzilla facing down his digital American alter ego is amusing, the actual execution was amateurish. All in all, too little of Tokyo being destroyed by giant monsters and too much moody expository dialog by sullen mutants.Let's hope they re-charge with some more fun movies next cycle."
3,More Expensive while being more Cheap.,"Not the best way to close out the series that has endured since 1954.It's way too fast moving and comes across more like a Power Rangers episode.They try to jam so much into 90 minutes that it comes out as a mess.Though it's still fun and has some really entertaining moments, the negatives really seem to outweigh the positives. Terrible music score that really brings it down. Also, blatantly and shamelessly rips off The Matrix, Independence Day, and Return of the Jedi.On a postive note, this IS one of the most ambitious Godzilla movies ever made. You can tell the producers really wanted to make a good movie. The only real problem is that they steer way to far off the original formula that made the Godzilla films work.Ishiro Honda would have hated to see this. Better way to remember the series is to view all the Godzilla films from 1954-1966."
2,Godzilla Final Wars - DUD,"I thought this was the worst Godzilla movie of all time. Even with all the monsters, SPFX. First the monsters werent on screen long enough. 2nd the music was totally out of place. 3rd the characters are totally unlikeable. 4th Godzilla takes forever to show. 5th this movie just sucked. There were a lot of Hedorah fans who got to see their monster come back, looking different, and a screen time of 1 minute. Who was this Hedorah I would have liked to have known more. Ebirah gets a minute in the movie. King Caesar(sp) why ?? Minya Why ??? Gigan, Rodan and Mothra were cool. Monster X was neat, and became Kaiser Ghidorah at the end... Being a G fan to the fullest, I was thoroughly disappointed with this piece of junk. Nothing traditional about this."
4,"cool, sick, a great film","This is a great film the actors are awesome the fights are cool and the special effects are the best yet. The main character is a mutant and plays his role amazingly. The story starts as aliens invade earth claiming they're peaceful. After earths protection force exposes their scheme to use humans as a food source, they must unleash godzilla (they froze him two years ago.) Then godzilla kicks all other monsters butts and fights the aliens unlimate weapon,Monster x. Later in that fight monster x evoles into monster x two. After a huge face off godzilla wins. During this the mutant fights a vey cool karte fight and just by a split second survive. This movie is great but has some flaws such as short fights (only beggining ones) to much humans not enough monsters and gigan has chain saw hands at a point. But overall this is a good movie and a very good choice for any godzilla fans if you don't mind waiting for monster action. I highly recomend it."
3,Not enough Godzilla,Great effort to make an interesting human side to the story and the monster fights are well done and look relaly cool but it seems to drag a bit in the middle as godzilla is absent from most of the film.
4,My son loves this video,"The video is silly and the only spoken word is ""Hopla."" The video is very low key and relaxing for little ones. The colors are bright and it keeps my son's interest. The video will not teach your kids calculus or how to build atom bombs but it will entertain them."
5,Kitty Durlactin,Great stuff....my vet bills have gone down!! My kitty has the herpes virus that used to flare up...$$$...she takesDurlactin and she's been fine. I highly recommend it.
4,Tasty soft chewy cookies that are guilt free! A++,"These soft chewy cookies are delicious, nutritious and in my top 5 cookies for gluten-free enjoyment. I usually bake my own using Pamela's mix or Arrowhead Mills gluten-free cookie mix but when I'm strapped for time these are perfect.Chocolate Chuck Cookie MixMy only negative about this cookie is they've only put 10 cookies in each bag.A bag should have at least a dozen right?It's challenging to make gluten-free taste good and they have done it. special note: My husband prefers Arrowhead mills and Pamela's to these. If you're looking for a crunchy gluten-free cookies I suggest Pamela's new gluten-free cookies - they come in a small pouch with miniature sized cookies."
3,"Not bad, but not too great","As a gluten-free person with a sweet tooth, I am always looking for the products that taste GREAT. ""Good enough for gluten-free"" doesn't cut it for me. Well, to me these cookies are just ""good enough."" I won't seek them out again. The taste is kinda there but kind of vague, the texture is kinda soft and airy, almost like a soft meringue.The Arico Almond Cranberry cookies, I LOVE. I will continue to buy them in bulk for all eternity."
2,Not quite right,"I wanted to like these, but couldn't quite do it. The soft chewyness is nice, but in the end there's a lot of grittiness to get through. The flavor was just a little weird. A fair amount of lemon-rind flavor, but not quite enough to carry the cookie. The ginger just added a weird flavor that didn't quite assert itself.Since I bought a case of these, I've been trying to slog through 6 bags... but what's the point of a""treat"" you have to force yourself to eat? (This is the first GF cookie I've disliked, so it's not the lack of gluten I'm objecting to.)"
4,These are great!,"I really enjoy these cookies. They taste a lot like cookies my mom made when I was a kid. It's hard to find packaged gluten free cookies that are soft and great tasting. Like everything gluten free, they should be tasted before you commit to buying in bulk, and I've found them at numerous health food stores."
5,I can't believe this works,"Wow, even in possibly lower quality mp3 format this worked very well for me. Immediately upon putting my headphones on I felt my mind clearing, and I was able to focus more easily and for a longer period of time. I was really reluctant to buy the CD, because the whole notion seemed sorta gimmicky. But hey, I'm a believer now. You really do need to wear headphones to get the most out of these, and I'm planning to rip any future CDs I buy in a lossless format.Seriously, give it a shot if, like me, you have difficulty focusing on work at times."
4,My aunt finally did it.,I would like to commend my aunt for the years of hard work that she has put into her book. It wasn't easy for her to do it but I am glad that she did. I know that this doesn't really go into detail about the book that she wrote but I figure that anyone who is dillegent enough to write a book and have it published between taking my cousins to their multiple events is well worth the read. I wonder what she is going to do next!!
2,Exasperating Audio!,"I bought this VERY EXPENSIVE video expecting nothing but the best... hah! I was wrong! The audio is grrrrr exasperating!! and considering the price of the set, it should have been premium quality. I didn't had the patience to watch it all.Maybe it contains some valuable information but, Britton takes Sooooo muuuuuch time explaining things that he makes my head wander!"
2,Cheap Emergency Wireless Mouse,"The title says it all. I had most of the problems others had except that I didn't have the problem with the batteries not fitting. My main objection is that this mouse eats batteries. I'm replacing them about every 2 weeks, sometimes more. The reason I have to do this seems to be that the light doesn't turn off when the mouse is idle so it burns the batteries up.Otherwise it's ok. I keep in a drawer just in case something happens to one of the other mice.Just some advice-- don't let it get too far from the mini-receiver and if it stops working check to see if the mini-receiver has been hit and lost contact with the computer-- the way it sticks out makes that easy to happen. Mine did not have the battery not fitting problem but because of how cheaply made these items are it was more luck than design."
3,Okay for the price,"I just got the mouse and I had started to get frustrated with it until I realized that there were installation instructions right on this site. I'd really like to thank whoever wrote them for taking the time to do it, specially because the product doesn't provide any way to contact the company that builds it - no website, no 1-800 number to call. Of course, for the price this was expected. I'm just happy I got it to work!"
3,Good Mouse for the Price,"Its not a fabulous wireless mouse, but it works well. The battery life is not so good, I think I go through a pair of AAAs every 2 weeks, but then I am on this a lot."
2,you get what you pay for,"This thing is a piece of chinese junk, they ship it directly from Hong Kong. The batteries don't fit tightly in the battery compartment so you have to keep taking the battery cover off and moving the batteries around to make it work. For 7 bucks it's not even worth paying the shipping to return it. Oh well, if you're a cheapskate you will buy it anyway but I warned you!"
4,Nice problem free build.,An old kit from back when things were simpler (I found the year 1977 stamped on a parts tree. Nice easy build. All parts have good fit with little cleanup.
2,JG you pay for what you get!!!,OK so Seller great and a flawless transaction. But very vague description not knowing JG made plastic gear box AEG's a little bummed. All in ALL resold the item for what I paid for it. but please be more descriptive.
5,Wonderful way to spend a quiet evening while hubby works the night shift...,Cuddled up with my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and a nice glass of read wine! Makes my TV obsolete...almost!!! Until football season comes back around!
4,Pleasantly surprised!,I think I watched most of the first series but very little since.I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and depth of relationships that has evolved. Addison (Kate Walsh) is particularly appealing in her struggles in her personal life whilst carrying on her demanding medical career. Benjamin Bratt's introduction into the series really added to it. Great seeing him play this more serious role.Most of the other characters and their intermingled profession/personal lives are all very watchable and believable.I thoroughly enjoyed it and will look out for the next season.
4,Sticking with the Storyline,"My wife and I have followed this series through each season and are engaged with the characters. Although we wonder when any of them actually see patients, we find the staff sympathetic enough to care what happens to them."
4,Private Practice,This show is amazing but this season will pull at your heart a lot. You can't believe what twists they put in it and how it makes you feel so much for the characters.
1,sizes way out of normal standard,"I ordered size M and received size M, but in real life it is smaller then size S.Since it was a gift for my cousin that I took with me to Europe when I left USA in early October, I couldn't bring it back and try to exchange, because shipping to Europe would be too expensive.For now, that particular short is sitting useless in my cousin's closet in Europe.Again, since it was a gift highly wanted, I was very dissappointed with you and myself in my cousin's eyes !!!"
4,Better than average movie,"I really enjoyed this film. Caterina is a country girl who moves to Rome with her parents. Her father is a teacher who has a grandiose vision of himself as a great writer (his work reads like a cheap paperback). Her mother is kind and pretty but a bit of an airhead. Caterina is trying to fit in at school. Does she belong with the Bohemians or with the rich socialites (think teenage Paris Hilton)?It's a charming coming of age movie. I couldn't help but think that Italy has the same social and political divide as we do in America. I found it amusing some classmates called her a ""Hillbilly"". Back in Detroit in the '70s I knew a Sicilian who called himself an ""Italian Hillbilly"". I thought it was kind of funny but I bet he was called that as a kid. I think anyone who remembers being a teen will like this flick."
4,respectable italian moviemaking (will beat 75% of what comes out of hollwood this year for watchability alone...,"don't read if you don't want plot items revealed...other reviewers have branded this a coming of age story...true enough, but the sub plot is the father, a middle aged man slowly becoming estranged from his family and losing his grip in the workplace as well. a scene outside the cafe kinda characterizes the entire picture when caterina's new friend dismisses her with cab fare, on his mother's orders. alas moving to roma is not the same as living in a small town... filmed around rome,you'll recognize some of the places if you've been before."
5,just wonderful,"It really is as good as the other reviewers say. I got this for the Jimmie Dale Gilmore tune, but I burst out crying with the Syd Straw number. There's a range of styles and emotions, but all of them top-notch."
2,mistakes,"I am currently a medical student, and Physiology is on our required texts list. It's an awful read. Very dry, very dense. Difficult to keep interested from one scattered clinical tidbit to the next. PLUS, there were multiple mistakes in just the few chapters I made myself go through. Thinking about petitioning for a new text listing for next year's class..."
4,Very good book!,"I study pharmacy in University of Brasilia and this book is great for all the organic systems except nervous. This is the book adopted in courses of Physio 1 and 2, and this was a good choice. I THINK NOT ONLY MEDICAL STUDENTS CAN READ IT AND THEY CAN LEARN MANY THINGS IN BOTH MACROSCOPIC AND MICROSCOPIC SCALES. The text includes the molecular processes that are so important to be understood by us. The book is very deep really, and if you want to learn to your life and job, not only to pass a test, it's excellent. However, I didn't like the order of the subjects, for me it's easier to understand reading the biophysical foundations first and the consequences after. For example, in section of Cardiovascular System, the chapter of Hemodynamics is after many comments about velocity, pression and flux of blood that cannot be understood without biophysical comments."
3,There are better Fair Isle books,"This is primarily a book with garmets based on ""Fair Isle"" technique, but not traditional Fair Isle motifs. Mushrooms, bees, berries and such are the motifs -- an interesting change from OXOX. The color charts are easy to follow, but the book is weak in technique and most of the patterns are for children. The largest pattern in the book is a 42"" chest measurement. Overall, you'll do better with any of a number of other books dealing in Fair Isle technique and motifs, including The Art of Fair Isle Knitting (gorgeous!) and Fair Isle Sweaters Simplified (good technique, but patterns designed for Philosopher's Wool only.)"
5,This book is a must-have for all Moms!,"Even from the first time I heard about this book from Jen Singer's website Mommasaid.net, I knew I had to have it! The title alone was reason enough to read it, and it was even better than I anticipated. As a Mom of a 2 year old and a one year old, this book makes me feel as if someone understands what I'm going through, day in and day out, during those loooooooong 14 hours till bedtime and sometimes all night too! I laughed out loud when I was reading this; my two year old watched me read it and now calls it the ""funny book."" It's also the type of book you can go back to and read again for a little laugh during a hard day. This is a great book to treat yourself or your friend to, and the short chapters are perfect for reading in your 2 minutes of free time! Best book I've read in a long time!"
3,"Some humor, but still a bit dark","I have three little ones at home, our oldest is 4 and he has twin brothers that are 19 months younger. I find that when I get together with other parents in similar situations we are always laughing about the things our kids do and the realities of life with little ones. I always find that after one of those sessions I feel recharged as a parent. I was hoping this book would be a similar experience. Some parts really were very nice and funny. But much of it fell into the kind of funny, but angry or sarcastic camp. This sort of jaded or dark humor is easier to write, but it did not give me a refreshing recharge. Instead, many parts leave you wondering when will they grow up and stop being so difficult. Bottom line, I wanted humor to refresh but felt like it created too much of a negative feel. If you are looking for more edgey parenting humor - this book works well and is funny in that way."
1,not compelling,"As a novel, this is not a terrific read. Kinda slow & dull story.One of the reasons I picked it up is that I had read somewhere that it was an anthropologically accurate portrayal of pre-historic people.Well. Probably not. The life portrayed is of hunter/gatherers in,perhaps the early 20th century. But, as archeology and anthropology indicates, early man did not live in the same way as hunter/gatherers did after the adoption of agriculture.This book is set in 20,000BCE. At that time, hunter/gatherers were not yet pushed into fringe areas where making a living was difficult. They had the ability to range over wide areas. There is no evidence that they starved in winter, and some evidence that they laid in winter stores.It's only a novel, of course. Still."
2,Disappointing,"I gave this 2 stars based on the total book average. I thought the chapters written about Yanan while she was alive deserved 3 stars and the ones written about her in the spirit world were 1 star material. There were a lot of good reviews about this book so I had high expectations, but this book is not anywhere near the same class as the Earth's Children series. Clan of the Cave Bear has character development, action, history, and suspense. I actually cared for Ayla. I tried to care for Yanan, but couldn't do it. I wanted to get to the end of the book, if only to see how she died and would everything be wrapped up into some grand finale, but like the rest of the book the end was a big disappointment. I was glad when I got to the end of the book because that meant it was over."
2,Longwinded Account of Early Civilization,"This story is much like that of Clan of the Cave Bear. If you have read either do not waste your time reading the other, they are nearly identicle. The style in which Reindeer Moon is written leaves nothing to the imagination, and offers little valuable information. The story itself could have been condensed leaving out some of the emense desciption."
5,An Amazing book,"I loved this book. It seemed to bring to life what it would have been like to live thousands and thousands of years ago when there were millions of animals and unbroken wilderness and humans were just a small percentage in that wilderness. They were both the hunters and the hunted and things were a lot more dangerous. My favorite part was Meri and Yanan's journey back to Graylag's lodge. Anyway, I loved it."
2,Not a very clear recording,"I usually like Murray Perahia's take on Bach, but this one just sounds hurried and the reception on my iPhone, which is where I like to listen to music, is fuzzy."
5,Excellent performance and recording,"Typical Murray Perahia Bach performance: pure, thoughtful, clean, well-recorded. This is a classic, understated performance - the inner voices are crystal clear, but it's Bach that's talking, not the pianist's ego or eccentricity. That's all to the good in Bach, who doesn't need a lot of help. I'm astounded that someone found this to be a one-star performance."
4,Well-engineered recording of an excellent artist,"I have only four recordings of the Goldberg Variations (including this one). Despite the general acclaim of the Gould recordings, I find Gould's rendition eccentric and not particularly thoughtful (sacrilege I know). Andras Schiff's recording is cold and lifeless - not far from what a computerized keyboard might produce if programmed to play this music. Daniel Barenboim's live performance is impressive and very introspective. I find the Perahia recording similar in both style and interpretation. This is my kind of Goldberg, without the exaggerated voicing or strange phrasing heard so often from other artists. I only wish he had cut his fingernails before recording this disc as the sound of clicking nails during fast variations is somewhat distracting."
5,Precise & Artistic,"Parahia is no doubt one of the ultimate and authoritative interpretors of Bach's keyboard works. This recording is a good exmaple of his precision (Teutonically so!) and artistry in a beautiful blend. This is the ""Mercedes"" of the Goldberg! Highly recommend it to anyone who likes Bach, keyboard, or baroque music."
3,Good for jazz lovers,I don't care for jazz but my friend gave me this CD and Swing (Manhattan Transfer) cause she said it would be good for me. The music is very sophisticated and voices are nice but really I think it is over my head.Some things I liked.Good for jazz lovers I think.
2,uninteresting,okay for background at a cocktail party. not much. mostly fluff. saw them at Blues Alley. CD disappointing.
2,Creates Tons of Static,"I bought this brush because it was supposed to help eliminate static electricity, but it is as bad or worse at creating static than any brush I've ever used. Big disappointment."
5,Great Album,"I can say this my all-time favorite -- a classic -- love every song. ""I Can Help"" is my favorite."
3,Billy Swan,I was happy with my purchas. It was packaged as it should be and the disk plays well no schathes it came new as it should have.Thank YouBarb
5,"Now's ""the day "" to buy this!","I bought this cd on the strength of an Amazon advert on the site something about ""country music that doesn't [stink]"" or ""Texan songwriters"". Anyway this is the best CD I have bought in a long time. It rocks pretty much from start to finish with a country Steve Earl type edge to it. It is also a bit ""southern rockish"" like Lynnrd Sknnrrd/ Outlaws which I also like. That said these guys are their own men, write their own stuff, are in their twenties and the sound is all their own no matter how you compare their influences. There is no weak track here and the best compliment I can pay is that I have ordered everything else they have done. Hopefully it will not be that long before the next CD appears."
5,RKs The Day reveals the band's musical maturation,"The first CD from Reckless Kelly Records (RKs 3rd) seems to have something for everyone. A couple of almost balladesque songs and a couple that lean more toward the rocking side of what the band calls their ""hick rock"" sound. Regardless, every song has that Reckless Kelly touch. Willie writes some great (some sad and some hilarious) lyrics about heartache from both sides of the coin, all to that great RK sound."
4,Quality product,"No complaints about the quality or ease of fitment. If you're still driving around on the original spark plug wires in your car, be aware that the standard issue wires from the manufacturer are only expected to last a few years & are considered a ""consumable,"" like tires, brake pads or oil. These will perform better and last longer than the original carbon core plug wires, and you can't beat'em for the price!"
2,unfortunately black and white and recorded in ep,"although hercules the avenger is a rare enought title that any copy is worth having, this copy is in black and white and recorded in the ep mode"
2,About the same as music,I've used it about 5 times.Seems about as effective as listening to music.I'll try it a few more times and update review if I see results.
1,Like your heads in an air conditioning system.,And when the engineer starts panning the sound its so noticeable it keeps you awake all night long. I'm trying a music one next.
1,died after a year and netgear couldn't care les,Netgear knows this router has a horrible problem where after a year it will just have to be constantly rebooted. They don't care and they will not help you. I had been a very long term customer ... not anymore.
2,You get what you pay for.,This is probably one of those things you want to buy new. I bought one used and it did not work.
1,lucky if you had a year,"My old one also died after a year, at that point it had to be rebooted a few times a day or hour. I found the setup easy so I purchased the same model. However the reboot problem occurred immediately with the new one. I tried 3 others but they all had the same problem so I switched to a Linksys model. The Linksys was harder to set up but hopefully it will work for awhile."
2,mediocre exposition,"This is all around a pretty mediocre, uninspired exposition of quantum field theory. More recent works by Weinberg and Peskin & Schroder, for example, are far more coherent and elegant."
4,Good reference book - Not enough essential math,"This book is an excellent reference for any student or professional in quantum theory. Although I found it very interesting, I feel that the chapter on strings should have been omitted. This could have allowed for additional mathematical proof of path integrals (Perhaps a simple axiomatic proof) or more applications of superspace to point particle theories."
3,"A fairly good book, but not suitable for an introduction","This is a good book. The nicest thing is how it handles renormalisation, a very complete approach. However, it have severe defects in mathematics. For example, its proof of Noether theorem is wrong. It is too sketchy with group theory, although it at first sight looks like an introduction. Only someone very well versed with group theory and representation can understand this chapter. Unfortunately, this is the mark of a rather sloppy mathematics writer, as further reading confirms. The comparison with Weinberg's precision and rigor is striking. I would recommend it however to someone wishing a clear introduction to renormalisation and the standard model, but with previous knowledge of QFT. I think the term ""introduction"" in the title is a bit misleading."
3,It could have been wonderful if...,"The scope of the book is very wide, it covers many topics (even quite advanced ones) not to be found in similar books. The problem is the large number of mathematical errors and typos, and its dishomogeneity: while some topics are well covered from basics up, others really require much advance knowledge."
2,A sloppy job,"The only thing that could possibly justify the word ""modern"" in the title of this book is that, at the very end, it includes a discussion of supergravity and string theory. Apart from that, both the choice of topics and their treatment are fairly standard. The book is not an ""introduction"" either; it touches upon quite involved issues in a rather casual way. At the same time, it is sloppy both in its presentation and its notation, and some of the ""proofs"" leave much to be desired. It reads like something that was written in a hurry, at the expense of clarity and coherence. If one is looking for an introduction, there are far better books around. More advanced readers will be able to find books that cover the same material in a much better way, in the same number of pages."
2,for absolute beginner only.,Nowhere in the book does the author go beyond the basics. There are a lot of discussions on US Government encryption policies.
4,Excellent book on Internet Security,"It covers security technology and privacy law, also how consumers can use free security software to protect their business secrets.The book discussed warnings by cyber rights advocates about the threat of Big Brother government and corporations."
4,Great tenis call bag for travel!,This is a good tennis ball travel bag! The zipper doesn't feel that strong but I have taken it on the road with my team and it is really easy to travel with.
5,A Central American Masterpiece,"Juan Carlos's musical talent is astounding and evident in this album. I have spent numerous nights being soothed to sleep by the rhythmic harmonies of Juan Carlos and Jeana. I speak English and limited Spanish, and the lyrics of both languages are poignant and positive, and help me to refocus my view on life, by seeing things from a totally new perspective. Looking forward to many more albums from this talented duo."
5,An indispensible tool for the costumer!,"Whether theatrically inclined, a home-sew hobbyist or a living historian, Davenport's efforts are an invaluable tool for those interested in period clothing. As well as a history of the fashions of the time, we are given insight into the lives behind the clothing. Interspersed are period lithographs and photographs, along with detailed descriptions of the garments, that are first rate. A pity that this book is unavalable! (Although it has been my experience that the local library's copies of it do not stay on the shelves for long!)"
3,Nice tome,"This is a nice book - large and informative. But I did not realize, nor was it specified, that this was just volume 1 - now I have to locate volume 2! I wish I had known or been told!"
3,"Very good, but...","I bought this cd after reading a collection of rave reviews onit. There is certainly nothing wrong with this cd, but the Autechre ghost lingers strongly over these proceedings! While there are some fantastic sounds and beats on here, its really nothing that Autechre hasn't done in the past. However, as an electronic musician myself, i'd be flattered if someone said my music was even in the same league with Autechre! So, if you're looking for some very good IDM music, and you have all the Autechre stuff, then by all means, pick this up!!"
4,Fresh and interesting,"This film provides an opportunity to witness the road to the presidency of an unlikley candidate in Bolivia. The filmmaker's access to Evo Morales and some of his supporters and allies provides a window into a political process that is both organic and extremely organized and hierchal. The power of community organization seems to outshine education, money, even ideology. The film also shows us the lives of women and men who live off of coca production, whose business has become more profitable as a result of the US crackdown on cocaine production. This relative profitability is also a powerful political tool to rally farmers behind this canditate. The complexities are somewhat burried in the story, but the perspective is sufficiently fresh to keep you watching and thinking."
1,horrible sound quality,"My review title says it all. The songs and the musicians on this album makes it sound like this ought to be a pretty good album, which is why I bought it. When I got it home and listened to it, I was very upset at how HORRIBLE the sound quality was, and I immediately returned it. At times you can't even hear the lead instrument. To call this ""fair"" sound quality is generous, in my opinion.If you must have it, take a look at another Eric Dolphy album called ""Green Dolphin Street"" (Live in Germany). I haven't heard it, but it's a reissue by another company, and according to the reviewer the sound was improved somewhat."
2,Dolphy Bootlegs II,"Four very extended performances featuring Eric Dolphy on bass clarinet with most - or perhaps all - of John Coltrane's rhythm section in support, captured between shows during Coltrane's and Dolphy's late 1961 European tour. Fair sound quality and up-and-down performances equal an essential purchase for fans, but an item of limited interest for the general audience. Nice to have it available, nevertheless."
3,It's ok.,"I think this was an ok book. Others are better, try Hanson:The official book. The reason i dont really like MMMBop to the top was that some statements were false, the boys hadn't even been a part of the making of the book. The book was informative,(if half the stuff was true.) yet annoyingly stupid. (ie: the chapter tittled: ""Zac: The ham on wry one.)"
3,For Fans,"This book is just fine for fans,When I was Hanson fan I enjoyed it very much.It is a very full biography.Hard to believe Taylor is now married,huh?!"
5,Hanson Fan's delight,"I am the biggest Hanson Fan in the world, and I had been looking forward to this book 2 months before it came out. When i finally got it I let out a scream of joy. Next, I showed off and bragged to my friends. The coolest thing was when i showed Emily a picture of zac she started acting really, and she said she was pretending to be Zac."
4,If you like Hanson and enjoy knowing about them GET the book,"The book ""hanson-MMMBop to the Top"" is very good. It tells you about their life BEFORE they made Middle Of Nowhere. It focuses on all of their songs on the c.d. There are some very good pictures of the guys.If you're REALLY into Hanson and like to get almost everything they are mentioned in then this book is for you. I have both copies of their unauthorized biographies, and this one is more real than the other so if you don't mind the book noticing Zac as ""The ham on Wry one"" than buy the book for $3 or so. It even offers addresses on how to reach the brothers and it will give you more information than you could imagine!"
5,A great excitiing book!,"This is a great book because I got to learn more about this group of teenage boys near my age. I love reading about where they have lived, there interests and other stuff. It's a good learning experience for me, even though, I will never need it in school it is still good to know because it gives me more reasons to like Hanson!!"
5,The bestest of best books!!!!,"Definatly a 10!! I already knew everything about Hanson, or so I thought. When I finished reading this book (which was in about an hour and a half ** I read fast!***) I was like, ""Wowzers, I really didn't know everything about the 3 hotties! Even my mom loved it!! Get it at local stores NOW! And look for the new CD and official book in stores soon! Oh and even a video tape. I'm 15 by the way!"
4,Worth a look,"yes, it's a bad title and scary cover, but there's some good writing to be found within. the kind of feminist thinking about porn that you definitely won't find inthe mass media -- or the new york review of books."
5,"great, but don't duplicate","This release is actually ""The Hottest New Group In Jazz,"" and with the exception of the bonus tracks, is found on the 2-CD set of the same name. Lambert is a little off-mic, or not quite at the same volume as Ross and Hendricks on some of the bonus tracks, which may be why they weren't intially released.The sound is superb, as are the performances. But take a look at the 2-CD set, which includes two additional albums."
5,How can I stop laughting?,"This book is hilarious from begining to end. Not extrange it was his most selling book in France. Again, the translation is wonderful."
5,great movie!!,I first watched this film in 5th grade. I have always been facinated by the Civil War and this movie stuck with me. Now my mom uses it in her 5th grade class room. It is an entertaining movie and it also teaches kids about that time in history.
2,Mad as H- - -,"If you have never seen this movie, you will probably enjoy it. But for those of us who have waited for a dvd of this movie, you will be angry with the editing (more like butchering) that was done to this thought provoking, heartfelt movie. I wanted to throw it in the garbage. So my search is still on for a true dvd copy of this great movie. If anyone knows how to get and unedited version of this movie, please post."
2,Who edited this from the original version? Message gets lost.,"I ordered the DVD version to replace my warped VHS but was disappointed to find that the movie was edited from its original form. I can only assume it was by the people that released the DVD. The scenes, though offensive, were key elements that drove home the emotion and horrors aspects of slavery without being too intense for middle school age students. I did not see any indication that this video was edited from its original context. Had I known, I would not have bought it. The editing ruined the message this story was trying to convey."
2,Great dealer.. lousy movie,This only goes for the content of the product.. The movie has been edited and doesn't include scenes that are important to the movie. I am not happy that this was edited the way it was. I wish that the company would make it with the full movie.
2,"Good product, but far too small","We bought and then returned the Scuttle Bug. It was well made and easy to snap together. However, it was far, far too small for our 27 months old daughter - who happens to be very petite (only 25 percentile for height and weight). Her knees dragged the ground. I think it is a cool product, but maybe for younger/smaller children. We wound up getting a kiddio trike which is fantastic!!"
4,"Small Trike, Big Fun","I ordered this as a Christmas present for my niece. She's two years old and still too small to peddle the conventional trike. It's been a big hit with her ever since she opened it on Christmas morning. The small size makes it great for scooting all over the house and the high density rubber wheels give good traction with out leaving any knicks or marks on our wooden floors. Only down side is the size is not adjustable and she will outgrow this in a year. By then her baby sister can take over. Worth the money so far. Well made trike. Smart concept, just wish it was adjustable"
3,Way too short,"I bought this for my 22 month old daughter, and it was too short for her to operate smoothly. She likes to ride it down slopes so she can just pick up her feet & roll. Well made but not great for toddlers who may be large for their age."
3,Good little scooter for around the house or outside,It is a great scooter to take anywhere & use inside or outside. Right now our daughter is scooting up & down our hallway because it is so cold outside. Burns off great energy in very active 2 1/2 year old.
5,Bjork's Best Single Yet!,"The single for All Is Full Of Love is Bjork's best yet. Every one of the remixes of this song are amazing. To tell you the truth I could not stand the original version and was really bummed when I heard it would be a single but I have to say that the video, the remixes and the packaging have made me change my mind about it."
3,I really wanted to like this book,"I was disappointed with the fairly dry presentation of material that I expected to be so interesting. The book is not without it's merits for the jazz lover who enjoys the recordings described. there is some inside info here but not much that couldn't be gathered from reading the excellent liner notes on the cd's themselves. The music captured on the Blue Note label is one of the great joys of my life. The RVG series of reissues on CD are consistently outstanding and capture a cultural period that was almost unbelievable in terms of the talent and creativity being expressed. I bought this book because I couldn't resist the desire to know as much as possible about the period and the personalities involved. The treatment here is adequate at best and at times quite dull. Sorry, but I can't give this more than 3 stars and that is based on the subject matter more than the style in which it is presented."
2,Total let down.,"This is a book for the Irritating Jazz ""Critic"". The type who held such power over the scene at the time, making and breaking as they pleased.For a start the book is obviously a vehicle for the authors favourites. Paragraphs galore are available for certain artsts, somewhat inexplicably for Coltrane (whose only recording for blue note is actually rubbished.) The name Sidney Bechet is quoted almost paragraph to paragraph. Jackie Maclean too.I found myself really disliking the book after Dexter Gordons entire blue note catalouge was rubbished.It only achieves the second star as it give a few new names to check out. If you must buy it wait till you find it second hand for a dollar."
1,what a waste,"the 6o's Blue note records are some of the greatest recordings, especillay the reissues of Rudy Van Gelder series. Any book has a lot of potential on this topic but the author is clueless-no research, no ""where are they now"", no inside information. Don't waste your time or money-I've seen liner notes with more insight than this.Buy the music instead."
5,Excellent Follow-up to 'A Night Out with Verve' box,"Beautiful. Billie Holiday blends seamlessly into Dinah Washington into Johnny Hodges into... this four box is the perfect background atmosphere for your swank cocktail party or that evening of candlelight romance. The compilers have collected a remarkable selection of music from classic Verve jazz heavyweights like Elle and Louie, Sarah Vaughan, Clifford Brown, Coleman Hawkins to, surprisingly, a few lesser known French artists such as Michael Legrand (who wrote the score for the French film 'Les Parapluies De Cherbourg') and Laura Fygi. This is a highly recommended classic jazz collection that will beautifully compliment your romantic evening in and will fit nicely into any classic jazz lovers music collection."
2,Seemed great at first...,"I had bought this brand of ear buds at a walmart, and thought they were pretty good quality. The bass wasn't the best I'd heard, but overall they were decent.I bought these ear buds back in February. It is now May, and the sound is going out in one ear.Don't waste your money. Please, buy something different."
1,not good,"For starters they are not comfortable in your ear and fall out easily, secondly they only lasted me a few months before they started to sound fuzzy and about a month after that they were completely useless. Who cares about a warranty when it would cost about just as much to buy a new set, a better one."
3,Good 'buds for the money,"I purchased these after my cat ate through the cord on my standard Ipod ear buds hoping for a slight upgrade since these are in-ear, sound isolating buds. Although they aren't perfect they are a good set of ear buds for their price. The fit snugly in my ears with the medium size covers and are very comfortable even when wearing for a long time. They block out external sound very well. I use them on the treadmill and cannot even hear the treadmill's motor at all. Sound quality is on par with apple's standard ear buds but sounds a bit richer due to the in-ear design. My only complaints are that the sound can get pretty muddy at high volumes and sometimes it sounds like the left bud is slightly louder than the right but i'm not sure if this is a defect or if the right one might not be as snug as the left. Overall, a very good product for the price."
3,great sound good price,This is the earbud that has deep bass. It's very good for R&B and Rap music. The weakness of this product is sometimes it is not stick so deep into the ear. you need to fix it every time if it not plug very well to get a full performance. Overall this is a good earbud with a great price.
1,Worst Headphones I've Ever Used,"I bought these headphones from a retail store before going on an overseas trip and they were the worst headphones I've ever purchased! The left ear bud was distinctly louder than the right - making it annoying to listen to anything. If I buy another Koss product, it'll be a pair of their full-sized headphones."
5,Wonderful music transporting listeners in time and space.,"Jonn Serrie's music transports the listener to the far side of space and well into the next millennium. Century Seasons showcases Serrie's's imagination, talent, and gift for translating inspired dreams and indelible images into memorable sounds and transportive rhythms. This two disk collection features Gentle The Night; Deep Mystery; The Tachyon Directive; Starport Indra; Century Seasons; Tingri Maiden; The Legacy; The Far River; Welcome Home; Andromeda Dream; Continuum; Aftervisions; The Century Princess; Land of Lyss; The Straits of Madigann; Glyder; The Ancient of Days; and The Last Secret. Total Time: 64:36."
5,Vaneli,"This is a really lovely pair of shoes, all my friends love it. It is true to size. The beige is beautiful and can match with almost anything. It can really dress up a casual outfit."
3,Really Beautiful,"I'm rating these shoes with 3-stars because they are incredibly beautiful. Also, it is difficult to find a beautiful and stylish shoe in wide width. These shoes come in W widths. However, I wore these shoes to a wedding and my 4th toe was in INCREDIBLE pain. It's been 48 hours since I took these shoes off and my toes still hurt. I've never experiences quite this degree of pain in a shoe before. Nor have I ever experienced pain in my 4th toe. It is a bit strange. I am sad about this because these truly are the most beautiful shoe I've seen in a long time and I really LOVE how they look. Nevertheless, other reviewers have stated that these shoes become more comfortable with each wearing, so I gave them a chance. It is true! I have worn them several more times and they are more comfortable. They are true to size. I bought a 8W. My foot is between a W and a M width. I LOVE these shoes. I want to give them 5 stars, but this is an edited review and I can't seem to change the # of stars."
1,Haven't get the cd yet,I had a due date for my cd on march 13th. Right now is march 21st. And still havent get my product. How can this problem could be solved? Or can you tell what the trouble is?
3,Paul whiteman orchestra,"Although the music was well done, it appeared to me to be like concert hall music with a large orchestra. I expectd the usual fast jazz. Mr. Whiteman was successful, but number (musicians) of people on the band stand doesn't move me. I don't think I will buy any of the ""King of Jazz""'s additional releases. Many of the small groups I find to my liking."
5,"Rat Fink: The Art of Ed ""Big Daddy"" Roth",Book was in excellent condition. Speedy delivery. Thanks so much.
3,The short life of the Mamas and Papas,"Michelle Phillips. now an actress primarily acting in TV movies and was in Knot's Landing, tells her version of the rise and fall of the group. Acid, sex and wild spending were part of the lifestyle of the Mamas and Papas, fired by the musical genius of John Phillips. Very interesting reading for those interested in this cultural phenomenon of the sixties."
2,Doesn't last very long,I bought two of these from HiTech via Amazon and they lasted in a Uniden phone (with a space for charging the extra battery) for about 2-3 years vs. the original batteries that lasted about 10 years. Now they lose charge after about 25 minutes of talking and don't necessarily charge up.
2,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,"The only scene worth the price was STORMY SUNDAY. There were three other scenes worth mentioning ,but only because a good job was done showing off some great TNA through lighting and camera angel. With the exception of STORMY SUNDAY and the shower scene in TENNIS ANYONE, there was nothing anymore erotic than what you would find on [premium channels] or other similar videos ....Even though he founded PLAYBOY , i suspect executive producer HUGH M. HEFNER's 1950's sensabilities may have held this production back from what it could have been. Purchase it at your own risk."
3,PB: Girlfriends (not too bad),"Now, don't get me wrong. The three stars looks decieving. This DVD is pretty good. The women, for the most part, are gorgeous throughout most of the scenes. The scenes tend to become monotonous but it is still definitely sexy. A lot is suggested sexual innuendoes but it is erotic. If you are looking for some good quality this is for you, but if you want something a little more erotic this just doesn't cut the cake."
3,cute,This movie was cute. I bought it at the thirft store for 50 cents. I love how Drew character Lucy made her parents realize what hell they were puttimg her through. And how they needed to talk and come to a comprise. Thats what marriage is about. A comprise. Very good movie. The armpit scense was yuck. Shave please.
4,"Ignore any bad reviews for ""Irreconcilable Differences""","Although slow at times Irreconcilable Differences is an involving film. It's very funny at times and also very touching too. To me it's an epic divorce movie with a knock out performance from Shelley Long. The scene when Long tells Ryan O'neal, ""You look like a rat!"" (while throwing a book at him).. is priceless. There are a number of scenes that are just as funny. The story is about a young girl (Drew Barrymore a few years after E. T.) that wants to divorce her very self-centered, career busy parents (Long & O'Neal). After I finished watching the movie I had the desire to see a few other Shelley Long classic's.. ""Hello Again"", ""Troop Beverly Hills"", & ""The Money Pit"" all came to mind. Who would have thought I'd be having a Shelley Long-athon this week? The film also stars Sharon Stone in her film debut.4 stars."
3,Uhhhhh,"I couldn`t wait to see this movie. I thought it would be so funny. Well was I wrong. It had too much romance and it was a bore. I really expected better in this movie. I don`t know if it was really a waste of Ryan O`neal, Shelley Long, and Drew Barrymore`s talents. It was okay. Right when I thought something funny would come up nothing would happen. I felt like turning it off, but I really couldn`t. I am a real movie watcher. There isn`t a day where I don`t watch a movie. I have to say if you are going to see this movie rent it. Then if you like it buy it. I`m just saying this isn`t a funny movie."
1,Shockingly Bad DVD Release,"This long awaited DVD release of the beloved 80's flick is a shockingly shoddy affair. It is quite literally an old vhs tape dubbed onto a DVD, even the old Vector Home Video lead is left on. The picture quality is horrible, and the film is presented in its VHS pan and scan state. I quite literally could have taken my old VHS tape and made the same thing with a DVD recorder. I highly suggest you do the same before wasting your money on this. The only reason that this release gets 1 star, is because of the on-screen trivia track, which means somebody at Lionsgate spent at least 2 hours working on this release."
2,Irreconciable Differences: DIVORCE THE DVD PRODUCERS...,"What a wonderful ""gem"" from the 80's that I've beenseeking to see on ""DVD"" just like ""Paul Mazursky's""Willie And Phil."" I was shocked that with all ofmodern technology that the producers sent out a""grainy old looking VHS"" copy of a ""FANTASTIC FILM.:After 2 minutes I just could not watch it in thiscondition on my ""HD"" screen. I could not believethat a ""shoddy"" copy would be put on DVD for thefirst time.The two stars goes to the script and the acting...but this is one of the worst looking DVD and I canonly hope that a ""true DVDS"" will one day be producedin ""pristine"" condition.What a disappointment!!!Sadly,larry"
1,Great film. Unbelievably bad transfer. Wait for a better version.,"I absolutely love this film. It's got great heart and characters. But do yourself a favor and wait til it's properly transferred. Echoing what other people have said: it's the worst transfer you'll ever see on DVD. This is my first review on Amazon - that's how compelled I was after seeing how horrible it is. You would be better off watching the VHS version. No joke. A new VHS in a hi-fi VCR would look MUCH better than this. What a crime. Lionsgate should be ashamed of themselves for selling this in the condition it's in. It's a classic, but don't ruin it by watching this version."
1,The Sharon Stone hairy Armpit Movie!,"I have always been a fan of Drew Barrymore and I have liked all of her movies that I have seen but I didn't like Irreconcilable Differences, the movie definitely had potential but I found it instead to be boring and it wasted the talents of Drew Barrymore, Shelley Long, Ryan O'Neal and Sharon Stone, and the sight of Sharon Stone's character with her hairy armpits is enough to make you want to hurl! This is definitely a movie I don't want to see again or have in my video or DVD collection!"
2,IRRECONCILABLE TRANSFER,"I echo some of the other reviews. The movie is terrific; the other ""Lost"" titles (with the exception of ""Slaughter High"") are full-framed but pristine prints. This transfer is as grainy as if I had taken the VHS and copied it myself to a DVD. It's an amazing rip-off, but I guess it doesn't matter to Lionsgate. I can't imagine what can be done, save sending back the discs. But since there's no other version (EXCEPT an old VHS copy--with the same quality) you're plum f***k out of luck."
1,"5 STAR MOVIE, 1 STAR DVD!",I always wondered why this beautifully written film was never released on DVD. It was initially released by warner bros and although it wasn't a huge hit it did well enough and received good reviews and golden globe nominations. When this film came out my parents were divorcing and I related to Drew's character. I also thought the parents were fully realized personalities. Of course none of this would work without the amazing work and chemistry of the 3 leads.Now 25 years later the DVD is released and it is CRAP! It appears that this is a video transfer (complete with the old vhs Vestron Video opening!). The image is full screen and is either extremly faded or so dark you can't see what's happening. Wow what a ripoff!This is a shoddy release of a film that deserved a lot better!
3,Fast shipping Horrible copy,As many other reviewers have stated before me...This is a Horrible copy of the move....Some scenes are so dark you cant even see them on the screen.....Save your money...Great hidden movie just a horrible grainy bad reproduction..I'll stick to the VHS version
1,Disappointing product,"The concept benind this product is sound - and would be quite useful -- if it worked.Which it doesn't. Color rendering is poor, the program bombs about once per 30 minutes, the calalogue of furniture is limited, obvious features (cut/paste) are missing.Overall, I regret buying the product. Wish someone else had written a review before I did."
1,don't waste your money. 0 sould be offered for ratings,"I am soooo disappointed with this program.As a child I used to love to desing home interiors from catalogs.I was so excited to see that I could once again relive my child hood fantasies.Boy am I disappointed!The graphics are awful. The furniture, etc. in The Sims are more realistic than the furniture with this program.The program is not user friendly.I wish that I had saved my receipt from Walmart so that i could get my money back.I probably could take it back..but the failures of this program are not Walmart's fault...but mine for being suchc a sucker.Don't waste your money!"
2,Doesn't quite make it,"The number of choices in some categories is limited. The program crashes/freezes often. I have had a number of difficulites placing objects and walls where I want them. All in all, a very frustrating program to use."
4,Memorable Ford Film,"Actaully 3 stars for Born Reckless and four stars for Pilgrimmage. Born Reckless is a pretty standard gangster movie (interesting for an early look at Randolph Scott and supposedly John Wayne), but Pilgrimmage is the big surprise on this disc - a lesser known Ford film that is a surprisingly mature and moving drama, graced by an outstanding performance by Henrietta Crosman in a complex (for that time) characterization. Ford, although probably most associated with John Wayne westerns (Stagecoach, The Searchers, etc.), displayed his greatest directorial skills when dealing with human drama. Interestingly enough, not one of his four Oscars (The Informer, The Grapes Of Wrath, How Green Was My Valley, and The Quiet Man, all of which are must-see films) was for a western. The film occasionally slides into melodrama, but the viewer needs to remember that this was the acting style of the time. The scenes involving the mothers of young men killed in World War I are particularly memorable."
2,Classic pop music,"I had high hopes for this particular purchase and that the sound quality would be brilliant like other CD purchases. Unfortunately the mix on several of the tracks was poor at best. Somehow the drum tracks on several songs are out of sync with the bulk of the music, very annoying to say the least. The only consolation I have is the one song I was truly after was in good shape, I will not buy anything in this series again."
4,"Imaginative, post-WWII pulp page turner.","A interesting read from '68 Hugo Award winner John Brunner about a conquered Earth where mankind is quickly reduced to Stone Age technology. Survivors of an alien invasion seek to counter-attack against what they assume is an other-dimensionally based alien invasion force using the aliens' crystalline based technology against them.Not a bad read. Age of Miracles reaches, in parts, to ground some of it's own wild fantasy material (synaesthesia, multi-dimensional aliens) in a contemporary reality by sacrificing and losing touch with the emotional interactions of the characters. Wouldn't seeing multiple planes (human/extraterrestrial) kinda of confuse you, too?All in all - it's a gritty post-WWII sci-fi/survival bookwith aliens as zombies."
2,Great Book but a BIG word of Caution,"Of the books available to prepare 8th graders for the High School Placement Test, in terms of content, layout and tips/strategies, this book is the best around. I plan on using it for a course I'm piloting beginning this weekend (10/28) in Pawtucket, RI.HOWEVER, I've discovered that the sample answer sheet in the back of the book (for the HSPT) designed for use with the two practice exams is missing space for responses to questions #41-50! I'm hoping this isn't reflective of editing done in the rest of the book, but I wont know till I use the materials in a classroom setting.I've called Random House, who has notified Princeton Review but as of this writing they have not responded to my call for help in resolving this issue. At the moment, I'm scrambling around for an answer sheet. Wish me luck."
3,cracking the coop/hspt,"The book is good. However, it was not carefully edited. There are mistakes in the number sequence on the HSPT answer sheet which leads to confuse when you are trying to do the sample test. There are also several mistakes in questions."
3,"Good Review, Bad Practice Tests","If you are planning on purchasing several review books, this is a good adjunct. Some of the practice sections and reviews are quite good. However, if you are planning to purchase this for the additional practice tests...Don't Bother!! There are numerous mistakes in both the answer sections and in the numbering on the answer sheets. It becomes too tedious to deal with and not worth the effort. Definitely do not get this book if it is the only one you are getting unless you are willing to work through and anticipate the errors so that your student/s can make the appropriate adjustments."
2,IT'S A MIRACLE IF YOU CAN STAY AWAKE TO READ THIS,"THIS BOOK IS ONE BIG WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. IT COVERS BEHIND THE SCENES CONCERNING THE KNICKS 1969-70 CHAMPIONSHIP SEASON. WELL IT DOES WITH A BUNCH OF TRIVIAL BORING FACTS. WHO CARES WHAT COLOR T- SHIRT BILL BRADLEY WEARS TO PRACTICE OR IF BILL HOSKET WEARS PAJAMAS TO BED. HARDLY ANYTIME WAS SPENT ON GAME TO GAME ACTION CONCERNING WHY THEY WON OR LOST. IT JUST RUNS THROUGH THE WHOLE SEASON AND PLAYOFFS MENTIONING HARDLY ANY GAME ACTION OR STATS. I FOUND THIS BOOK VERY DISAPPOINTING, I SKIPPED OVER MANY PAGES OF FACTS THAT ARE TOTALLY REDUNDENT AND HAD NO IMPACT ON ANYONE EXCEPT THE AUTHOR. NOT WORTH READING UNLESS YOU SUFFER FROM INSOMNIA."
4,Great for ESL Intermediate-Advanced Teachers,"Great common idioms, with very good practice. Very popular with my students. Each set of idioms comes with conversation models, very sufficient definitions with examples, activities, pronounciation, and good discussion activities using the idioms."
4,"Plague, and ""the Rest""","I'd divide this album into two sections, ""Plague of Ghosts"", which covers the whole second half of the album, and ""The Rest"". From the earlier comments, it's fairly obvious that the ""Plague of Ghosts"" suite is brilliant, so I won't dwell on that. I just wanted to make a couple of comments on ""The Rest"". It's mostly good, but I'd avoid ""Rites of Passage,"" and to a lesser extent, ""Tilted Cross"". In the former, Fish's vocals and lyrics, which are good, are overshadowed by a sop. sax. solo which sounds like something Kenny G. would do. Yuk. ""Tilted Cross"" is Ok, but kind of leaves me flat. It feels a little too thin. On the other hand, ""Incomplete,"" and ""Faith Healer"" are both excellent. ""Incomplete"" is a beutiful duet/ballad, and ""Faith Healer"" absolutely rocks. More than anything, I'd say these two tracks carry the whole first side."
4,good music,"This is very interesting, good music. I really like Marillion and wanted to try a solo album by Fish, it does not disappoint. The music is not Marillion but I really enjoy it. Mission Statement, Faith healer, & Digging(part of the plague of ghosts) are my favorite cuts."
2,"Very disappointing, burn it with a Zippo!","Even though I am a real Fish fan, I can't follow most of my collegues. Virgil and Exile were definitely the best, but I also liked Suits and Sunsets very much. But the Zippo thing is definitely his poorest work. The first 7 tracks are all too thin or simply just loud and they don't have the power to really move me inside. The second ""concept"" part is just a poor trial to warm up the genius Childhood times, but at last only a few nice keyboard pads and guitar riffs remain. Sorry, Uncle Fish, this is not the album I was expecting from you!"
2,Disappointing,"I always look forward to new Fish recordings, but this one really let me down. In my opinion, only 'Tilted Cross' stands out from this album."
1,Mediocre - Ordinary,"The music is weak the lyrics are ordinary. As an old Marillion fan it is more than likely my expectations are too high. 'Vigil' is the only post-marillion song that comes close.If you are hoping to hear some of that old magic, forget it. It's like Pink Floyd without Roger Waters and vice-versa."
1,caution if you are planning to use an mp3 player,"not for mp3 players that cannot dock and have to use headphone jack connection. only the poorly amplyfied speaker system works, unless you like spending that that type of money for speakers and letting the charger feature, video out, etc sit there useless."
1,Horrible - died within a few months,"This battery is terrible. It died within a few months of use. I have tried running it down to nothing and recharging and all sorts of other recommendations. I trashed it in less than a year. Tried saving some money over the actual IBM brand battery, and I ended up wasting the money..."
1,Broke the first time used,The very first time I used this it fell apart. I put it back together and it fell apart again right away. Very poor quality.
1,Ours broke after very little use and cannot be repaired. Junk.,That's it really: ours broke after little use and is now a collection of cheap parts. It worked well for a short while.
2,broke after minimal use,"After less than a year, I'm back to Amazon to find a different sifter as a replacement. We only used it to dust a few cakes with powdered sugar, so I didn't think I needed to invest in an expensive sifter. Today, I see the handle (top) is no longer attached to the cup, making it useless. Now I plan to invest in a better quality sifter and hope it lasts years like my mother's has!"
4,My model seemed too small,"I was disappointed in the size of this sifter. Maybe my kitchen misconceptions got the best of me, but I was thinking a standard sifter would be around 3 cups (that's how much recipes usually call for), but this 3 cup sifter doesn't seem that big at all. I wish I had gotten the 5 cup model, because that seems more ""average"" sifter size. Of course you don't have to worry about ""overflow"" with the hand trigger that you do with the average crank sifter, so maybe that's where I went wrong.Other than the obvious size misconception, it seems to be made well. There are 2 sifting screens for the flower to be rotated through. The spring loaded handle is easy and comfortable to hold. The stainless steel quality should make this gift a nice gift for my mom to use and wash in the dishwasher (though I have no idea if that is even recommended.)"
1,Useless,"I have to crank the handle about 300 times to get 1 cup of flour sifted. It goes faster if I just bang on the side of the thing and shake it around. I can see that the mechanism is working fine and all the parts are moving, but there is some flaw in the design."
5,great album full of originality,"Vintersorg returns with their third release, and this will satisfy all your heavy metal needs. Vintersorg's trademark vocals liven up this CD, along with acoustic passages, excellent female vocals, and catchy guitars. Well played and well produced music make this CD a must have."
5,Vintersorg strikes again!,"Vintersorg is very good one man viking metal band from Sweden.Vintersorg shows in this release an improvment of his music showed on the last two albuns, now Vintersorg is using less splatter vocals and is working with more melodies. This is viking metal on its best way, you will just travel to the past when listening to the nine musics of this great masterpiece. Vintersorg is one of the greatest musicians on this kind of music. People who like viking metal, Vintersorg or even classic rock mixed with folk music, but a little heavier, must buy this album.."

2,Unfortunate casting,"A fairy tale about the Dr. Samuel Mudd arrested for aiding and abetting the Lincoln assassins, virtually none of it grounded in historical fact. Hard to know what motivated the making of it, especially in the casting of its protagonist Warner Baxter, a dull choice to carry the lead and to engender sympathy. It feels like Ford is treading water here until he sinks his teeth into his masterpieces a couple years hence. I've collected most of Ford's talkies and this one is definitely a lesser effort. The better choices for mid-30s Ford are two with Will Rogers, Dr. Bull and Judge Priest, The lost Patrol, and of course The Informer."
4,As innocent as OJ,"Excellent early John Ford movie and it was good to see John Carradine pop up-he was usually one of Ford's players in his stock company anyhow.But Mudds tale as this movie tells it??So syrupy and sentimental that you may have to brush your teeth afterwards.IMO, Mudd was guilty.He knew it was JWB.Don't forget, Mudd just missed doing the 'rope dance' by a 5-4 decision.Read Steer's 'His Name Is Still Mudd' if you still have doubts.But by all means watch this movie!!!One of Ford's seldom seen but enjoyable works!!"
3,A product worthy of it's time,"A film dealing in part with a subject seldom touched upon in Hollywood; in this case, the military tribunals which passed judgment upon those who played even insignificant roles in one of history's greatest tragedies- and always the verdict was the same. Guilty, regardless of the facts.It may be worth pointing out that this is a movie from the 1930s, and it's stereotypical portrayal of African-Americans was no doubt intended to win the favor of theater goers of that era. Keep this in the back of your mind as you view this.All in all, a good movie. Not a great one, but a good one."
5,Excellent,I rated this 'toy's' educational value as 5 stars simply because when a child can dress up and go into their own little world I think there is great value in the use of their imagination and creativity. My daughter wore this for a halloween costume and for dress up since then. It's been very durable for the price!
5,Handy cloth,"There is not much to praise or complain. This is a handy (small package, you can attach to the caerma bag or to your keychain) and good quality cloth."
5,"Very handy, I keep it connected to my camera strap",This is a nice little cleaning cloth and what makes it so useful is that it's attached to a storage bag and clip. I keep it clipped to my camera strap. I can keep my lens filter clean without having to go search for a lens cleaning cloth.
2,Nikon Microfibre Cloth,"I agree completely with ""Aragon""'s Review. This cloth is too small, and the open end of the pouch is just ridiculous. To ensure, dust, lint and dirt does not get inside the ""gaping"" open end, I have put mine in a little plastic bag, which totally defeats the purpose. One star is a bit harsh, but 2 stars seems a bit much. If you have to go with Nikon, go with the Lens Cleaning Kit.Nikon Complete Lens Cleaner KitSomeone needs to make a cloth attached via a stretchable band inside a little pouch that is close-able."
2,Falls Short,"The cloth is nice but it concerns me that the cloth sticks out of the little container, thereby picking up dirt, dust, etc. that can be easily transferred to camera equipment......"
2,Not worth the high price,"First, the price on this product used to be $4 and now it's $7 - not sure why they felt the need to increase it? Second, the size is nothing like the photo shown. I was quite disappointed. Not to mention, I'm not a fan of a product who likes to disply it's brand name in such a loud manner.It works fine - does what it states. But like I said, due to price & size, you are better off going to an eyeglass store & buying the same cloth for less than half of the price. Does the job & they are larger in size."
3,Think small,"I have another brand of this type of cleaning cloth which is much larger. I assumed this one would be similar in size, but it's much smaller. Pay close attention to the size of the cloth in the picture relative to the neoprene cover."
2,Seemed like a good idea,"This is another of those things that I bought that seemed like a good idea at the time, but in the field, it did not prove to be useful... If I were you, I would stay away from it.. It just is not a usuable product... Looks nice, but is a waste of your money. You will play with it for awhile, like I did, then that will be the end of the attention it gets... Just get some micro clothes at the dollar store and move on.. I actually put my micro cloths in a ziplok bag to keep dust, sand, etc off of them. and you can laundry them.. Along these lines, I prefer an item I do use a lot and that is those lens cleaner pen/brushes that is sold here by different vendors. Has a retractable brush on one end and a lens cleaner pad on the other. I use these a lot.... One should however to be sure when using them to use the brush first to get the grit off the lens before using the cleaning pad... Just a good common sense approach, etc....."
4,Very handy!,"I have attached this onto my D7000 for when it's needed and it really does the trick. It's nice not to have dive through the camera bag in order to find something to clean your lenses. The fact that it can attach to your strap was the most attractive feature and so far, it's been worth its price."
5,clean everything,"I use this to clean about thing from glasses to lenses only 2 i trust for this, Oakley and Nikon"
3,good product-too expensive,"This is a quality product, but way too expensive for the small cloth you get. One can get a largercloth for the same amount of money."
4,Nikon 8072 Microfiber Cleaning Cloth,Nice little stocking stuffer for my girls for there new Nikon D3100. Nice and small and know it will fit in the camera bag I got for them for also for Christmas.
5,Good Product,"Good product, does as needed. Haven't had any problems with it, just make sure to wash it every once in a while so dirt, dust, etc. doesn't collect on it and get on the lens."
4,If these are spudz then the price is really high,On X-treme Geek website these are $2.29 if you buy 5 plus shipping. The 10 inch ones are $7.95.
3,...cute...,Well i guess i expected more for the price i paid. The cloth is a bit shorter than i would like and when cleaning a lens it feels slightly awkward in my hands and difficult to get all edges/ areas with out worrying that i might accidentely lose my grip and scratch the glass with my nails. I could of just bought a micro fiber cloth at a pharmacy near the non-perscriptive reading glasses. But i guess the fact that it has a little clip thingy makes it handy to just hook onto bag instead of zipping it up in a pocket. Its cute though.
4,Small and handy.,I keep this in my camera bag. It does a good job of providing lint and dust free cleaning.
5,Handy and convenient,This is a great item to clip onto your camera strap or onto a zipper on your camera bag. Throw it in the washer when its dirty. I bought two one for my 35mm equipment and one for the digital.
5,Handy,"This was an impulse buy for me but I am glad I did it. The cloth is very small, and is barely noticed in my pocket while the pouch and cloth hang off my keys. It has been useful for my lenses ...... and also my glasses."
4,Very handy.,"It's quite good, although the clip is not big enough to embrace the bit of my bag as I wish it could."
4,Nikon 8072 Microfiber Cleaning Cloth,"Product works ok though it's a bit small for my liking... Small enough to hang on your camera bag, or stuff it in a zipped compartment... I prefer to keep it in a compartment, you want to keep it clean and away from dirt the best you can..."
5,"Great stuff, wish it was cheaper though","Handy little gem. Great for cleaning filters, viewfinders and even your glasses :) If there was ever a complaint, that would be the price... it is just a piece of microfiber cloth after all..."
4,Good Little Lens Cloth,"I bought this for cleaning my glasses, and eyeprotection when I'm out in the field. It's a good cloth, with good size; it'll get the job done without any scratches. I gave it a four star because I thought there was a way to close the pouch, but it can't and will not close. Other than that, great product"
5,"Easy, and functional.","I didn't think much of this, just needed a cleaning cloth. When it arrived I was surprised, and 4 months later I still use it everyday. It's a really nice product, and many of my friends have commented on it, with comments like ""oh that's neat"" or ""I really need one of those."" Good purchase."
1,Save your money,"Very disappointed in the product. Go to your eye doc or Walmart optometrist and get one cheaper and bigger. My real disappointment was the shipping and handling charge was almost as costly as the item shipped. Almost $5 to ship a $6.99 item. Sorry, for the poor review."
2,Cleaning cloth,It may scratch your lens if there is any dust on it... Over a period of time this is detrimental.
3,this is NOT Nikon!,you have to know it's not Nikon .. its just a logo printed on it !it feels cheap and its not bad after all ..
1,Piece of garbage,"I used this to clean my eye glasses. This cloth leaves a linty smudge on my eye glasses. Also when I look through my eye glasses after cleaning with this cloth, my eye glasses look darker when I wore them.Previously I used a microfiber cloth from LensCrafter and this worked a great deal better.I guess I was sold by the NIKON name!It is obvious that all microfiber cloths are NOT EQUAL. BEWARE.I would not recommend this product at all."
3,CLEANING CLOTH,"LENS CLOTH IS A GOOD TOOL!! PACKAGING POUCH LEAVES MUCH TO BE DESIRED. GETTING IT OUT IS FINE, BUT. REPLACING IS A REAL HASSLE. THERE HAS GOT TO BE A BETTER IDEA???"
4,Does what it should,"Again it is a name branded item, check your local electronics or camera shop and you should be able to find the same thing for less if not this product is good and was attained on sale here on Amazon at the time."
2,bad quality,"the idea is good, but the product very bad quality.. I was afraid to clean my L lenses with this product.it does not look like real Microfiber...!very cheap.."
3,Nice small package,"Haven't really used it, but the small bag it fits in makes it easy to store in a camera bag. All in all, it's just a cleaning cloth which is a necessary item in all camera bags."
4,Handy to carry around,"The Nikon microfiber cloth is a decent quality cloth. One corner is sewn straight into a tiny pouch that the whole thing stuffs into. This is handy, as you can clip the pouch onto your bag or your strap, and always have it nearby. It's quite frustrating to have your mf cloth fall out of your pocket or bag into the dirt, so this is a nice feature to have. Like all Nikon accessories, for what you're getting, you pay alot. This is no exception, but again, like all Nikon accessories, it's simple and works well.PROS:+ Good quality cloth+ Attached pouch can stay clipped to something+ Pouch is small enough to go unnoticed in your pocketCONS:- A little bit pricey for what it is"
4,Good product for the money.,It's what can be expected for the price. Works as well .... it's compact and easy to access and use.
2,nice idea but doesnt work well,I like the convenience of having a cloth on my keychain...but its always falling out of its sack...so its getting dirty and kind of defeats the purpose
3,Nikon 8072 Microfiber Cleaning Cloth,The cloth itself is very good quality but I was disappointed that I have to manually push it back inside after each use.I've then found and purchasedCarson Optical super-soft microfiber lens cloth for all Lenses and Eye Glasseswhich has the same idea with an exception that cloth can be drawn inside by drawstring.
4,"Nice, heavy-duty spoon rest","This works very well for what I need and is heavy duty. I broke the last one I had, so decided to go with a solid product as opposed to ceramic this time. My only complaint is the number of stickers that they stuck right to this product that took me an extended period to remove and even with washing it, I can still see the outline of a couple of the stickers. I'd rather not use a chemical to remove this, like a glue remover, since it is used for food."
3,Smaller than expected,Ths product is very small compared to its description. I cook a lot and wanted something that was big enough to hold 3-4 spatulas. This doesn't. Returned it.
3,"Nice product, but annoying stickers!","I received this in the mail to give as a gift to my sister. The size will be nice because it can hold more than one cooking utensils if need be, which is what peaked my interest in the first place to make the purchase. However, the giant sticker on the front of the product seems completely unnecessary and has been quite a nuisance to remove. Normally I wouldn't hold something like this against a product, but I'm struggling to find the purpose in marketing the product this way. If I was given the opportunity, I would probably just buy the same spoon rest I bought myself 8 years ago (no stickers) and avoid the headache!"
5,As Advertised,This product is as described and provides a large flat surface to hold all kitchen utensil sizes. Have both hand washed and washed in dishwasher and is easily cleaned.
1,not stainless,"I really liked this spoon rest, however, it's not really stainless and it has serious signs of corrosion only 2 months after ordering it."
1,Did not work for my little girl,She thinks it is a great toy but does not seem to make her more comfortable at all and if she has it on sh puts it on the wrong way - she thinks it is funny.
2,Somewhat useful,"The person below apparently can't read herself, since the item description above clearly says it is for 24 months and UNDER. This works okay for smaller babies, who most parents really feel need it, but it doesn't stay in place very well. I am sure it would hold up better for the larger child, as it would better fit the neck, but by then they have a lot more muscle control. I could have lived without it."
1,waste of money,"i bought this when my son was about 1 month old, hoping it would keep his head from slumping so much in the car seat/infant carrier. it didn't work. first of all, it wouldn't fit comfortably around his neck, and then it kept falling off. i gave up after a few tries. wouldn't recommend buying this product."
2,It burns,"I don't know the name for the specific part of the penis on the tip of the head. Anyway if you get this stuff on there it burns and will likely bring a manly tear to your eye. I tried it again this time completely avoiding the tip of my penis, but i still didn't get the desired effect."
2,Ok product,"This product is ok ,I tried it first time,only thing it does is nums your skin but it does not work as it should.if you really want to imporove on anything then do breathing exercises."
4,All American Special for country fans,"This cd is pretty good although it will be really good if you like all kinds of artists whats good about it is not the same artist song after song. You have many great acts like Terri Clark, George Strait and Leann Womack and many more. Personally though the songs that they picked for the various artists are not there best they have sung better than that and the cd ends with Americas tribute with God Bless the U.S.A from Lee Greenwood."
2,Poor Quality,"Purchased last week from Bait and Tackle shop, I'm buying a new one today on Amazon. It is very poor quality and does not have eye hook and does not stay together (Fold). After one use the rods were bent at top. Our old one lasted 6 years and just died of rust. It was still probably better than this net. Get one that folds, is strong and has an eye hook. You will be better served."
5,helpful and unbiased,"I bought this book for my mother, and although I had to go through it with her, it made the whole concept of reverse mortgages so much easier for both of us to understand. i thought i had done my homework, but this book cleared up some misconceptions i had, and taught me a lot about the loan and it's pros and cons without trying to sell me on getting one. it also put my mind at ease about repaying the loan and what would be left for me and my siblings, and gave us something to think about in terms of making arrangements for our mother's future. It's definitely the best source on the subject that i've found yet."
4,Reverse Mortgages for Dummies,"Somewhat informative, some articles are confusing, but for the foremost it helped me determine what I can/want to do when I retire, in regards to obtaining a reverse mortgage for retirement income."
2,try before you buy,I'm a big fan of squirrell nut zippers I love all there other album's especially Inevitable. THis Cd though was just not up to their usual standards. I agree with the earlier reviewer that this cd sounds rushed. The worst example of this to me is the horrible carolina christmas in which the singing sounds offkey and just horrible.
4,Hit or miss but the hits are WELL worth it.,"There are definitely some tracks I skip on this Christmas record. But it's well worth the purchase price just for the truly phenomenal rendition of ""Sleigh Ride"", easily the most raucous, terrific, wonderful version of that song I've ever heard. Other standouts include the interpretation of ""Winter Weather,"" which is just dripping with sass, ""Carolina Christmas"" and ""Hot Christmas"", which are a blast, and ""Indian Giver"" which is a heck of a fun shot at yuletide blues. The downtempo numbers aren't my favorites, and frankly a few of them are just a little too much of a bummer if you're trying to be festive.Anyway, though: the half of this album that hits is easily worth the purchase."
2,Disappointed,"Hate to say it, because their other cd's are among the most treasured that I own, but this was a major let-down. Definitely listen before you buy; this is only for hard-core completists..."
5,Spice up your Holiday!,"Loving Christmas time and Christmas music, this is one of my favorite CDs to listen to. It spices up your collection of Christmas tunes. Friends always comment on is CD when it is played, and it has never been bad! Living in North Carolina, I especially love Carolina Christmas."
3,Christmas Caravan a disappointment,"Christmas Caravan was a disappointment. I am a huge SNZ fan, but this album had a feel of being completed in an hour. The songs were uninteresting and not very musical, with the exception of ""Indian Giver."""
1,BAD,"This album is god-AWFUL! Why, oh why, have the zippers done this to us? From start to finish, the music is sounds flat, as if it was hurried into production. The zippers, sadly, have debased their currency."
3,"com""YULE""ation Cleric : Grown-ups Gett`n It Back","Going Retro gives the young`ns some simulative memories of merriment, while allowing talented artists to rediscover it`s bliss.""As with so many things that are supposed to make you happy,Christmas has it`s downside. The Thanksgiving turkey is hardly cold before the inevitable pounding of Christmas songs begins, with all the numbing repetition of a good spanking."" ~ Tom Maxwell. Well REJOICE Amazonians, Americana lives with a fresh set of yultide here for enjoyment. If it weren`t for plenty of originality it`s likely not to make a wrapped apperance under my tree. But I find solace with this CD giving, as understanding will come in time.Merrily Mix 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,and 10. Post Script~ Once again,may they always find room for a little more. Kind`a modern-mirth-maker benchmark of 12 tracks,but glad to find yultide treasure included for that seasonal surprisal.***buyit*saveit*shareit*giveit*donateit***"
1,Squirrel Nut's Zipper's down,"Let me start by saying that I am a fan of big band, jazz, and the ""new"" swing of the '90's. Squirrel Nut Zippers is definitely one of my favorite bands and ""Hot,"" ""The Inevitable,"" and ""Perennial Favorites"" are in my ""play-as-often-as-possible"" pile. Unfortunately, I sincerely doubt whether they were told they were recording a Christmas album or just having a jam session in their basement. This album is a huge disappointment, lacking in spirit - holiday or otherwise. Only a rabid fan should consider purchasing without previewing."
5,My Favorite Christmas CD,"When you get sick and tired of the Morman Tabernacle Choir or Elvis or even Nat King Cole singing the same old tired Christmas caroles, it's time to play the Squirrel Nut Zippers' Christmas Caravan. It's lively, it's fun, it's Christmas with some real spirit. Enjoy!"
5,Unbelievably Timeless,"I have to give this CD five stars and wish it could be ten. I grew up listening to these songs and Martina could not have done them any better than the originals. This is high praise indeed when you are singing Merle Haggard, Tammy Wynette, Ray Price, Lynn Anderson, and I could go on. I bought this CD today and had to go out and buy it for my Mom and it is one of those CD's where you could stand on a corner and give to everyone just so they could enjoy it as much as I did. Once again Martina gives 110% and hopefully will reach a whole new set of fans for the old classics."
5,"Great music, great singer, great CD","Martina McBride at her best here. Old songs, some known, some less; very well performed, and the right pitch and tempo to tug at your heart without being too syrupy. Very nice!I recommend to all country music lovers, and definitely to Martina McBride fans. She's the real deal and in this CD she is clearly in her element. Am waiting for more such lovelies!"
5,You will love this CD,I have this CD and bought this one for a friend for Christmas. Martina sings the oldies and it is awesome1
5,A Masterful Music Collection,"A totally flawless performance. Best cover record I have ever heard. Martina McBride beautifully interprets these classic songs, even capturing the inflection and intotnation of such diverse artists as Merle Haggard, Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Loretta Lynn, Buck Owens, Jeanne Pruett, and Lynn Anderson. The entire album is masterfully produced, with attention paid to every detail."
1,Martina McBride (Timeless),"McBride does not do justice to the great old songs she is singing. She sings the words, but there is no emotion, no feeling. The music is sterile. It seems as though she just wants to get through the songs as quick as possible and be done with job. The instruments backing her up are similarly uninspired. Their music is bland at best and could have been mailed in. I regard the money I paid for this album as poorly spent."
1,Lazy!,"I think it's very lazy to rush out an album of cover songs. Rod Stewart started this trend with his last 4 albums being all covers. His works better because he sings the songs in a new style or reworks them to sound different.This is just by-the-numbers remakes of the old songs with similar arrangements to the originals (which all are better than the new versions!)Don't get me wrong. I think Martina McBride is a great vocalist. She just doesn't put forth much effort on this release. It's time to work a little harder, Martina!"
1,her worst album ever!!!,"this has to be her worst cd ever, Martina does not sound good on any of these songs, even the first single ""rose garden"" floped on the charts!! if you really want to hear a great remake album ,check out dolly partons new cd ""those were the days"" and leave ""timeless"" in the bin!!!!"
2,"martina shines,but not on ""timeless""","I have always been a huge fan of Martina,but her latest cd just does not do it for me, not sure why? I just didnt care for an album of remakes. she does shine on a a few tracks like ""i still miss someone"" with dolly parton and ""thanks alot"" but thats about it! if you have never bought a martina cd than i would skip this and buy one of her last couple albums. like i said martina shines, but not on ""timeless""."
1,A great voice wasted,"such a great voice wasted on classic country hits! even ""rose garden"" which was the first single floped on the charts, radio dosent want remakes and neither do I. its a waste of a voice and a waste of money!!!"
4,Great value and good listening,"I have always enjoyed Martina's voice. This is, as another reviewer put it, ""your parent's country music"". I remember hearing most of the original versions of these tunes on long car trips to Grandma's house. I especially enjoy Rose Garden. Thanks Martina!"
2,Ho Hum,"I Recently bought ""Time Has Come"" on an impulse out of a Walmart sale bin. LOVED IT!!! So then, picked up ""Timeless"". Yawn. I was bored stiff with most of the tracks. All done better by others. Admittedly, I am not a major country fan. I just know what I like. Then I received my first Carrie Underwood CD, ""Carnival Ride"" as a gift and was blown away. That girl can sing! I'm afraid Martina paled in comparison, at least for my taste. I think the ""Timeless"" songs, all famous standards do nothing for her, whereas the songs on ""Time Has Come"" all really worked with her voice. Just my opinion. If you are new to Martina, I'd start with ""Time Has Come""."
2,"The songs themselves are ""Timeless,"" but not necessarily these versions","Martina McBride doesn't embarrass herself on these covers of some of country's greatest hits, but she really doesn't add anything to the party either. With slavish devotion to the originals, she recreates, but does not embellish these songs. There really is no individuality here, which is a shame because McBride can sing, but these versions just make you think of how much more affecting the originals are. Perhaps the best thing this CD can do is make you search out other versions of these songs and see what can be done with some imagination."
2,Not for the younger genereation Martina fans!,"I am sure this is a great CD for people who remember these songs from back in the day. But as a young twenty-something Martina McBride fan, it's just not my cup of tea. I just can't relate to any of the songs on this CD! Sorry! If you love old songs, buy this CD. If you are young and don't recognize any of this music, leave it alone! I actually bought this thinking it was Martina's newest realease album of new songs, on the sole basis that it was Martina's work and a new album I didn't have yet. But I wish I had listened to samples first, because it's not my thing. I might try to like it by listening to it more, but until then..."
2,Not the martina we all love!,"i love martina but this cd is weak, the sound is not good and her voice doesnt have the power like her past albums! plus i didnt like the covers she did!they have all been over done as far as remakes go! just all in all a very weak album from martina! better choices would be the new albums from sara evans ""real fine place"" or dolly partons ""those were the days"""
2,Yawnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn,"Martina Mcbride has a lovely voice, and there are worse things than this cd. However this is my least favorite of her Cds and it's pretty boring to me. Lead Single ""Rose Garden"" is nice carpon copy of Lynn Anderson's 1970 hit, but not sure it needed a remake. Many of these songs Are also boring and the cd has been put up on the shelf."
5,I JUST LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!,ONE OF THE BEST CDS I OWN!! I DONT LIKE VERY MUCH OLD COUNTRY MUSIC BUT MARTINA MADE ME LIKE IT!!!!!!!!! I LOVE THIS CD .... I RECOMEND PEOPLE GO AND I BUY IT!!! YOU WONT REGRET! EXCELENT CD.
4,Not bad,I've read the reviews and listened to the album and it IS good. Where is the old Martina??????????? She's right here...........
5,They call such music timeless for a reason,"Timeless pairs one of the finest voices in country music with songs that are worth hearing. For some reason I can't understand, the bulk of country music being performed today is tainted with a ""sameness"" about it. That was the malady that ended the careers of noteworthy artists such as Ike Turner and Jimmy Reed in years past. The net result of such music is a reincarnation of disco with a country beat – the heart of this kind of music is in the background, and it does not matter who is singing because the background is all that comes through. I don’t mean to paint the whole industry with a broad brush, but such junk permeates the country scene today, and this makes a recording such as Timeless stand out all the more – a great voice matched with great compositions."
4,these songs need to live on,"A nice set from the British singer. The songs of Sandy Denny are criminally unknown and unheard (especially in the USA), and any project that gets them back into circulation deserves attention (in the Fall of 2001, Clayton stated her intention to record a second volume in this series). Clayton's voice is well-suited to the material, though any female vocalist ever born suffers from comparison with Denny. Clayton often sings Denny's parts at the annual Fairport Convention Cropredy Festival in England (and does a good job, as evidenced by the live recordings; as opposed to some other unfortunate vocal performances over the years at the festival--eg. June Tabor, Linda Thompson.....it seems that the idea of singing the late Sandy's parts in front of a festival crowd has caused some good singers to choke)."
1,DO NOT TRAVEL TO BURMA,"Tourism is an important source of income for the dictatorship in Burma, providing it with millions of pounds every year. Forced labour has been used to develop many tourist facilities. Democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi has asked tourists not to visit Burma."
1,Hopelessly outdated and frequently just wrong,"I'm currently on a round the world trip. So I've read a lot of guidebooks. And this is the most outdated and frequently simply wrong guidebook I've come accross (I visited Myanmar in January 2004). Of course I realize that e.g. prices go up, service might go down, owners change etc.. But this guidebooks has almost been more miss then hit. I've been to guesthouses where the architecture of the place was so completely different from what the LP described that it's simply impossible that the author was there! On top of that there are tons of things where the LP is simply outdated to the point of being useless: In Yangon and Mandalay busses leave from different places then described, all of the country markets are open at different days etc. etc..Btw: You can NOT cash travellers cheques or use your visa card in Myanmar and you do not have to change money into FEC any longer."
2,Update not realy update,"Lonely Planet published this updated version in September 2002. I have visited Myanmar in August 2003 (a very good experience!), and found the guidebook only usefull for the descriptions of places to visit (although even there some interesting places are not mentioned in the guide), and the maps. For places to stay and eat, the guide is completely outdated. For instance, new hotels have started business long before 2002, that are not mentioned in the guide. It looks like the 2002 ""update"" mainly concerned the (important) political situation."
2,Not helpful,"I just came back from Myanmar. This guidebook is hopelessly outdated in regard to practical information. It is at least 10 years behind on current conditions which are constantly changing. The only useful information is concerning sightseeing but even that is inaccurate. The problem is that there is no other current guidebook in print.For hotels use the internet directrooms.com, asiarooms.com or asiahotels.com."
2,"Interesting, but very poor video quality","While nice to see Master Odo in a video performing the katas, the overall quality of the video makes the DVD difficult to watch."
1,A total fraud,"This so called movie is a total fraud. It is not even a movie at all, it is a long rambling theological speech by some pastor, videotaped badly at some religious gathering. Fortunately the quality was also so bad that the video packed up about half way through, necessitating me to re-set by Roku device. Fortunately, as the video was incomplete, I will be able to ask for my money back."
1,i do not recommend this,"is hypocritical show, even thou am a Muslim and love listening to Pastors and teaching of Christianity, I really find this show as aman made ideas and not the real bible, am sorry pastor but you are boring and wrong putting wrong ideas in all renters head and your church."
1,What a frustrating experience this has been,"Do not, I repeat, do not buy this program unless you love being frustrated at every turn. This program has screwed up my bookkeeping so badly - thanks to it's trial versions"" that I am simply going to start over with Quicken. I now can't even access the program - the program I PURCHASED - and it will cost me a minimum of $40 ($4 per minute, $40 minimum) to talk to a tech support person. What a rip off. Bye-bye first edge, hello quicken."
1,"A Good Product that Could be Better, but POOR SUPPORT","This product is probably OK for its target market, but could stand some improvements. I use it almost every day for bookkeeping purposes for both my small businesses (web design and book publishing).HOWEVER, I was infuriated that there was NO tech support for this program. Instead I was told I had to PURCHASE tech support, and this would have cost me half as much again as I had paid for the program.MYOB should charge a higher price for the product, instead of deceiving people into buying something that definitely needs tech support--at least for the first couple of weeks--and then trying to force them to pay extra for support.I didn't pay for the support, and have made it thus far (about six months). I am planning to upgrade to either QuickBooks or MYOB AccountEdge at the end of this year."
1,As bad as it sounds,"I wish that I had paid more attention to the critical reviews above. Instead, I thought a Mac product had to be good. Unfortunately, though it advertises great things, one can't even save changed versions of the forms it provides. There is no call in number for initial free tech support. The email advice their tech support people sent me failed to solve the problem. I am sorely disappointed and ready to return the product to Amazon, which sold it to me."
3,Reviews far too old?,"I have a very early version of MYOB for the Mac from the early 1990s. It worked very well once I learned its intricacies, which took some time. However I did not keep up with the new versions and now I can't use it at all with an Intel Mac so am looking into upgrading. The reviews presently are from 2005. Doesn't anyone have anything to say about it in 2009? I'm a photographer and educator, one man band, so a simple program is what I want. Quickbooks? Quicken? MYOB?"
1,accounting haystack,"FirstEdge is the most frustrating, counter-intuitive accounting software I have ever used. I started with BestBooks, then MYOB... both were very user-friendly and more than adequate -- but FirstEdge went off the rails. Of course it can do anything you need IF you can find it. I am a graphic designer NOT an accountant. I need to get in and get out. For my needs, FirstEdge is the haystack and every simple task is the needle."
3,Same old draggy formula,"I must say, after their impressive debut album, this is rather a disappointment. While the debut album was full of strong melodies, they have somewhat lost it here. And they are still using the same formula, low-key, monotonous love songs. The vocals seem neither going up nor down. What adds to the boredom is that the choruses are also sung by just the lead vocalist, without any backing vocals. None of the songs are menorable here, except for the slow version (wrongly titled as acoustic version) of ""Monday Morning 5:19"". Well, if this goes on to the 3rd album, I am not going to buy them anymore. But why 3 stars ? Well, I think I am still hooked to their sweet tunes, although getting a bit bored."
3,Go to sea,"A collection of stories about going to sea. Some are wonderful, some are bizarre. NOT a collection of SAILING stories (as I had thought). Still, a nice way to be introduced to many different authors."
3,"Profits, Taxes, & LLCs","The book is very detailed about the financial. Hard to understand and I have several degrees. I have taken graduate course in accounting and was a tax preparer and still found it difficult to understand what he's taking about. Overall it a reference book, but leaves some questions unanswered and might not help in doing the bookkeeping for a new LLC you just formed."
1,Not so good,"Very dry, not particularly insightful, lots of text copied wholesale from the tax code. A better text isTax Savvy for Small Business: Year-round Tax Strategies to Save You Moneyby Frederick W. Daily"
3,LLCs,"This book had a few good pointers, but concentrates on California law, which differs from other states in some regards. I was not impressed with the quality of the writing. I would not buy it again."
2,Completely disappointing,"The picture quality with this kit is pretty terrible. I would get a somewhat fuzzy image and there is a ghost image that's slightly to the right of the original image. It's not too noticeable with fast moving games, but with games that use alot of text or at the dashboard it is very noticeable and distracting. The component cables that came with the system didn't have any of these issues. Overall, it's very disappointing and I can't recommend anybody in buying this even at this price."
1,stay away if you want digital audio,"I purchased this cable for my HD TV and digital audio receiver. The Digital Audio port did not work with this cable. However when I tried the more expensive cable, this one worked.http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000B6MLPU/qid=1132803297/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8__i1_xgl63/102-1564128-3610526?v=glance&s;=videogames&n;=1000"
5,A great place to start for Billy Wilder,"Yes, you can definitely make a list of the four top Billy Wilder movies and it would not match what is in this set. But that list would include the two Wilder masterpieces (""Some Like It Hot"" and ""The Apartment"") and ""The Fortune Cookie"" is very very underrated. So to have those three in one set is nothing to quibble over. And the fourth film, ""Kiss Me Stupid"", is still both entertaining and an interesting step on Wilder's progression towards ""Avanti!"". So if you own now Wilder you should start with this boxed set.My only issue with this set is that the version of ""Some Like It Hot"" is not subtitled. But given the excellence of the movies themselves this did not detract from my rating or my enjoyment."
2,Too Clever and Too Obscure,"Sure, Pushkin had fun with his Russian, and why shouldn't a translator carry that playfulness into his translation. But damn, I found it way too distracting. The introduction by Hofstadter was very interesting and conveyed his love and dedication to this novel; my hopes were high for an enjoyable ride. But I found the novel too dificult to follow, and the clever translation distracting. Hofstadter himself recommends a translation by Falen, and I concur, finding it much easier to follow."
3,Too self indulgent,"This version is not that great, he fails to capture the music of the poetry and calls way to much attention to his own lack of beautiful writing. In his defense, this work is probably impossible to translate accurately not even Falen comes close, and you should probably just learn Russian. Cheers"
3,GRD's opinion of Onegin,"Amazon recalled the book after it was not forwarded to our current address. It was ordered under my wife's name, but now I have my own account. If it had been sent by US Mail rather than by another courier,it would have been forwarded to our current address.I read a copy from the library and found it be worth reading,for comparison with the Charles Johnston translation and for the author's citations and opinion of other translations."
5,Another Masterpiece,Smith is becoming the Faulkner of the Appalachian region and her books just keep getting better. The details of the snake-handling community are fabulous. You live the experience with Florida Grace and cannot go away unaffected.
4,Saving Grace,"Saving Grace by Lee Smith is about the life of Grace Shepherd, the daughter of a snake handling Holiness preacher. Because of the poverty in which she grew up and the disappointments in her life, Grace has a hard time believing in Jesus. The setting of the novel is Appalachia, and Smith realistically portrays the dialect and customs of the region. I enjoyed the book and plan to read more of Lee Smith's works."
3,Not her best work,"Lee Smith is great with words, she really is. Nevertheless, I was a little disappointed with this book in comparison with some others she's written. It was a little difficult for me to suspend my disbelief in this one - granted the subject of snake handlers and holy rollers is a bit sensational. Agree about the disappointing ending. Nevertheless, her narrative style is good and typically southern and I can recommend it to anyone looking for a good, humourous, sensitive story."
3,"Well-done, but ...","This is a very good book, but I did not like the ending, nor do I agree with critics who say it is her best (which is Family Linen or Fancy Strut, perhaps). It's another fine character study thought. I just hoped that Florida Grace Shepherd would grow to find herself in ways different from how she did. I expected more of her I guess, because I liked her so much. But, that is what makes Lee Smith's books so readable for me: I come to care about her characters and what happens to them, especially the ones I like, but I become invested in caring about the fate of even those I cannot stand, like Grace's father, a huckstering, snake-handling, back-woods preacher. I guess I care because Smith creates such plausible personalities on the page. Also, Smith had done her homework well and could show these people, warts and all, without condescending, sentimentalizing, or oversimplifying. The exception, as I see it, is the ending, which I see as more sentimental than psychologically probable."
4,Good southern read,"This was a good southern book, but I too was disappointed in the ending. I thought the character development of Florida Grace was good, but I hoped she would find herself in a different way."
3,Was Grace really saved?,Beatifully written! I kept looking for Grace to rise above her father's misguided sense of righteousness. She had her chance and then degenerated to the worst side of her father's example. The hint of reform and salvation in the conclusion was weak at best. There is even a suicidal hint which would take her in her father's direction again. The portrayal of characters through the book is beautifully graphic...too bad that the main character is left in a haze.
4,Well Done,I'd forgotten I'd read this until I found it in my bookcase. It's excellent--I think almost everyone will find something to appreciate.
2,Sorry to the author,Lee Smith is my all-time favorite writer. I have read all of her books except for her newest novel. This is my least favorite by a long shot.
3,Great Knowledge but Poor Delivery,"I appreciated the information contained in this small book, but it is in serious want of editing. Grammatical errors and awkward sentence structure make it a little difficult to read. Otherwise, the message is wonderful."
4,Great book terrible editing.,"The book was great having great content, however the editing of the book was terrible. Many typo errors made the reading of the book very distracting. Sometimes the typos would create a word that did not make sense in the context it was used and I would have to stop reading and figure out the word. For an old book I am surprised that their were that many errors.I recommend the book for the compelling message it delivers."
4,Working with the Law - Highly Recommend It!,"Working With The LawThis is an excellent book with timeless concept. It is written so that the reader can easily apply the content to everyday situations. It is really a practical guide to using spiritual principles. Alas, the Kindle version has numerous errors that are a bit distracting."
5,Working the Law,"I am very pleased that I purchased this book. It is not a book you can, or is meant to be read one time to have a full understanding of the information contained. I have read it 4 times now and get something new out of it each time I read it. I also feel better, calmer and more confident about myself after each reading. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is working on the LAW of ATTRACTION."
5,a must read if you are focusing on self-improvement,A must read if you are focusing on self-improvement. This work covers most aspects regarding the Law of Attraction and has been one of the most comprehensive works (in a very condensed fashion) I have came across in the field of Universal Law. It is indeed a masterpiece and will give you a clear and real look and understanding regarding the Law of Attraction and abundance in all areas of your life.Well written and easy to understand - Five Stars++++++
1,Lack of quality -,"I purchased five copies of this book for a class.While the laws are explained clearly - the misprints,typos, and confusing subtitle Law of Attracktion aredistracting and disappointing. Has proofreading becomepass'e?"
1,Spelling mistakes all over this book!,Attracktion???? Look at the title!! Wilder Publications is self service publisher - whoever did this messed it up royally. Multiple spelling mistakes in the entire book changing the entire meaning of the words and sentences. BAD!
1,Poor Service,"I ordered this CD on July 6, 2010 and today is August 9, 2010 and still have not recieved this CD and due to this service I will not order from amazon.com again.Thank you"
2,very average&way too soon,"Angie stone is like a Songstress version of alicia Keys to me. most of Her biggest Hits sound like songs from 25-30 years ago.vocally she has some nice runs,but She is only good for a few cuts here&there.She doesn't hold my ear for a whole album though.this is way too soon&a sign that while she is a decent Songwriter that the solo Artist run just might be over."
2,Song Skips,"Although these are some great songs on this CD, I am surprised that track #4 skips. I checked the back to see if there are any visible scratches but there aren't. And since I didn't unwrap the CD ASAP, it might be too late to return it. But other than that, the songs are good, especially the first three!"
5,A great collection,My husband and I love Angie Stone. I purchased this CD for my husband for Christmas and he's been listening to it ever since. Hopefully I'll have a chance to listen to it soon. If you are an Angie Stone fan this is a must have CD.
4,nice variety of old school Angie,"You'll find quite a few of your favorite old-school Angie cuts on this CD. Nice collection! For the price, it can't be beat."
1,WRONG! ALL WRONG!,"This travesty is filled with useless and inaccurate misinformation which could quite easily result in an experimenter being maimed, blinded or killed. The illustrations are so crudely rendered they might as well have been drawn with a crayon. Only the first twenty-or-so pages are original material -- the remainder of the book consists of nearly illegible photocopies of obsolete pyrotechnics and ballistics patents and similar filler material. A disgusting waste of paper!"
2,Survival manual,A good book for refrence material for the HAZMAT courses I teach. If you are buying this with the intent to use the information be really careful because some of the information is flat out wrong and will get you hurt and it will also get you put on a few watch lists.
5,Just What I Was Looking For,I really wanted to paint my project myself and this book convinced me that I can do it. Ganahl gives all the information I'll need to paint my Lotus 7 replica (Stalker V6). The right amount of detail along with hints and tips are just what I needed.
3,Book is ok,The info in this book is ok it seems to be mixed with alot of older info. This book would be a good choice if you have not painted for a long time and just wanted to do a quick paint job on daily driver.
4,Well done book...,"I have had this for about a year to read and re-read, while I slowly buy the parts needed for a paint job at home. I have the paint guns, compressor, sanders, etc...and I'm almost ready to begin.Lots of good tips and anecdotes, and TONS of color photos make this a great bible to own. It hasn't answered one question however: how quickly do you need to work to keep the paint from hardening in the gun? Paint spec sheets list ""pot life"" but I'm not sure how to calculate it.Acrylic urethane single-stage is my choice."
5,very good book,"Very good book on car paint job. I live in Brasil and I have a project of restoration of my 2 VW, a beetle and a brazilian type III (variant II). All the content of this book from the beginning to the end where plent of useful information for what I'm going to do. For sure is a must read for anyone that don't belong to the car painting business and have in mind to spray paint in a car in the home garage with home equipment. This book shows the best way to do this."
5,Great resource,This is a great book for the DIYer. I found the material well written and very informative
5,Great Christmas book!,This book was lots of fun this Christmas and quickly became my two and half year old's favorite nighttime story. She loved finding Bob on all the pages and singing along with a couple of the stories. Very cute and clever!
2,A little disappointing for Sandra Boynton,I love most of Sandra Boynton's stuff and this book was a bit of a disappointment. Her poems didn't seem to flow real well throughout the whole book. This is probably one of our least favorite books from her.
3,Okay for the younger ones,"My 1 1/2 year-old enjoyed this okay, but the stories aren't long enough to interest or appeal to my 3-year old. I wouldn't bother getting this for older toddlers."
5,Great book,This book was a Christmas gift for my grandson and he loves it. You cannot get a better rating than that.
2,Not Boynton's Best,"Sandra Boynton books are the favorites in our household, so we were excited to find this book at what seemed like a great value. Unfortunately, most of the verse is ridiculously repetitive and lacking. The book has its moments (such as the hippo wearing the bikini), but overall, this is not Boynton's best. I think we'll hold out for a Little Pookie Christmas book!"
2,Was this supposed to be used?,"Maybe I missed this, but the book showed up in bad condition- scratched, bent, dirty- just generally beat up. I don't remember ordering a used book!"
1,VERY UNPLEASNT,It was very bad none of students liked it. The storys were hard to understand. Bob the main story was the most diffulcult tyo understand. I think you should not buy this book.
3,"Doesn't live up to ""Snoozers""","This book is in the same format as Snoozers, which has been one of my 4-year-old's favorites since she was 2. I ordered this as soon as I saw it, hoping it would be as good. It's not. It's cute, but the rhymes are more forced, the stories are less clever, and the song at the end is barely singable (unlike the goofy and endearing ""Silly Lullaby"") in Snoozers. This isn't a complete loser, but unlike it's predecessor, I'm not buying extra copies as gifts."
2,Not the Best of Boynton,"I have most of the other Boynton books because I love the characters, humor and simplicity. Unfortunately, I don't think this is the best of her collection. The stories are strange and disjointed. Sure, they are individual stories, but the book just seems choppy. The illustrations are up to par, just not the stories themselves."
5,a picture saves a thousand words,"The story of Colette in her ""own"" words is really a montage of images. The attempt to make it appear as if the photographs were compiled and edited by her own hands are convincing. There are many biographies on Colette which describe how she felt and what she said. But the images of which this book is devoted to describe quite different sentiments. I thought it peculiar that she is never seen smiling in any photograph after she marries. For a woman that extolled the virtues of positive and pragmatic thinking that seems peculiar. Possibly she was wounded early in life and decided that life was about pain so one might as well accept it and not complain."
3,Just OK,"The color and consistancy of this product was good...however if you have sensitive skin like I do, be careful. This irritated my skin, I'm not able to use it."
1,No expiration date,There wasn't an expiration date printed on any of the bottles which is kind of shady. It either means its expired already or not the real thing. Use with caution.
5,Smooth and look nice for nude make-up,"Can't cover any spot on the face, but look natural for nude make-up. Not dry."
4,Great but not for those with oily skin,I bought this because my sister raved about it. It does offer sheer coverage which I like but I find that for my combination to oily skin that this just makes it even oiler. I'll still use it but only in the wintertime when my skin gets a little dry from the weather and lack of humidity. I love the fact that it comes with SPF 15.
5,For those with a fear of foundation...,"...there is tinted moisturizer. Stila makes a very light one that comes in four different shades (light, medium, dark and warm)and contains SPF15 to protect you against early crow's feet. Give your face a boost without looking like Tammy Faye- a little of this stuff goes a long way. Once you try Stila's tinted moisturizer, you'll never use liquid foundation again. (Remember, though, that a tinted moisturizer won't conceal dark circles, acne or other skin blemishes.)"
2,Not for me . . .,"I bought this product after reading all the rave reviews on Amazon. I was generally not impressed with the product--it was too thick and heavily tinted. It was not thick in a good, ""a little goes a long way"" way either. If you have dry/combination skin (which I do) you need to put a LOT on your face to get it to feel properly moisturized, and I don't think the bottle would last very long--not that I would know how long it lasts because I ended up reverting back to my moisturizer-sunscreen-foundation routine after a few days of struggling with this product. If it works for you, more power to you, but was not right for my skin type."
2,Smears,"I used to LOVE this mascara. It was my favorite for years. I don't know if they changed the formula, or if my skin has changed, but I had to stop using it because I found that it smeared terribly. I found myself with perpetual raccoon eye. The positives, this mascara glides on like no other I have tried, almost like it is a lotion. It is also virtually clump free. I am a fan of Clinique in general, but this mascara unfortunately does not work for me. I would suggest trying it at a makeup counter or buying a trial size before you spend so much on it."
3,Works OK but setup instruction is not clear,Works OK but the setup instruction is not clear on how to program control two different garage doors.The style and size could be improved (smaller) even it is for older garage doors (only 10 yrs. old)
5,Voice Power,"This CD is a blessing ... A blessing of calm, relaxation and reclaiming the gift of breath and self expression!"
2,Not worth the money.,"I'm not going to waste my time explaining why this cd does nothing. I bought it, listen to it, and wish I didn't...Anyone Want My Cd."
2,Yuppies travel West,"I picked this book up at Borders', intrigued by the title and happy to take an armchair vacation across the west. While I enjoyed their travels, sympathized with their need to abandon the corporate world, I must admit I was a bit nauseated by the replacement of one chic place for another (Santa Fe). It wasn't like they had exactly abandonned or developed new life styles and an appreciation of the ""simpler life."" Sure, they were giving up a ""Manhattan high stressed life"" -- after all it was killing them. Who could live that world very long? But their materialistic superficial values continued. They still live in a glossy unreal yuppie world (Santa Fe). However, on the up side, I did enjoy their travels with all the comforts of home built in."
4,"A book which is good reading for RVers,","First We Quit Our Jobs, is a chronicle of a RVing couple who took a four month trip starting in New York State, across country, into Canada, north to Alaska, south through coastal Canada back into the lower forty-eight, then east, southeast and northeast and back to New York. For those of us who have been RVing and been on the road this grand trek might not seem so unusal. For Marilyn Abraham and her husband Sandy this trek was their introduction to their motor home. It was their first experience. Until they took off that July morning they had never been in an RV before!As the title states, first they quit their jobs, gave up their life in the fast lane and traded everything in for life in a twenty-nine foot Winnie. Some of their experiences we may take for granted. For example the friendliness of people they meet in their travels and at campgrounds was surprimg to them. A good book for all RVers who take to the open raod and might consider being full-timers."
4,All I Ask,"I truly enjoyed this book. I enjoyed Deb and Derrin. It was rockey at first, but the ending was beautiful."
3,Afraid to Trust love Again !,All I Ask was a true romance story to the point ! After being hurt Deborah was afraid to try love again ! This is an easy read as well as a pageturner ! You could certainly feel the romance between Deb and Darrin ! If you are looking for a good romance novel give All I Ask a chance ! A good Read
1,I Didn't really understand the plot.,I didn't see the plot in this story. The relationship between the main characters were really lopsided and didn't really get into the real reasons why the heroine treated the hero they way she did.I hope the next book Ms. Keaton writes will be better.
4,Beauty and Muscles i.e. Mansfield and Hargitay,"The beautiful Jayne Mansfield costars with her former Mr. Universe hubby Micky Hargitay.No mind blowing plots here, although Mansfield does play a dual role, one evil one good. This movie also features a cheap Hydra that Herc has to fight off.I wonder why Hargitay didn't have a beard like the other Herc stars?Tyrants of Bablyon was originally released as Goliath vs The Tyrants of Bablyon and stars Rock Stevens (real name Peter Lupus of Mission Impossible fame)Again the plot is simple and has Goliath throwing a lot of Italians around in this flick and tear down the walls of Bablyon.If you like these sword and sandal spaghetti movies, you'll like this one as well."
4,TARANTINO: THE TRUTH ABOUT THE FICTION,"THIS INTERVIEW WENT TO THE DEPTHS OF THE TARANTINO HISTORY/POINT OF VIEW. I ENJOYED IT, IT IS BETTER THAN ANY INTERVIEW OR COMMENTARY THAT YOU WOULD FIND ON ANY TARANTINO DVD. IT HAS TO BE EXPERIENCED TO GRASP THE BIG PICTURE. I RECOMMEND TO ANY FILM FAN, ESPECIALLY A TARANTINO FAN."

3,"Mistaken identity, not Pride and Predjudice","I bought this book thinking it was the third in the series by Pamela Aidan. It would seem that many others did also, as the Aidan books are a recap of the Jane Austen book Pride and Predjudice, and yet under the note of buyers other purchases, there were all Jane Austen books! I really have nothing to say about this book, unfortunately, as I haven't read it yet. Just thought I should warn the public that it has nothing to do with Jane Austen."
3,"""Dull soulless dance music""","That's a phrase AbFab character Patsy uses to describe the music scene, but it almost fits here. On its own merit, this disc is little more than sound bites from the series set to a generic dance beat, which adds a bit of kitsch to a nightclub Saturday night. And to be fair, the elements are blended with skill and precision. However, when compared to the Pet Shop Boys' own AbFab tribute, it's apparent that their version is simply more listenable. There's a melody and structure, which is conspicuously absent here. Pleasant club track; annoying in any other context."
5,Good book,This book is very good. I feel that it applies to everyone and anyone can benefit by reading it. The harder part is to put Marcus Aurelius's wisdom into practice...
5,Philosophy @ its best!,I will keep it short:Amazon shipped the order rather quickly - the book came nice and new - the reading itself is irreplaceable. Would definitely recommend for others.
4,"Great Book, but Boring at Some Points","Any body that has a desire to learn should read this book. It has a lot of wisdom that can be gained from reading it, although if you really want to gain wisdom, you should read Proverbs from the Bible. The book is very well organized and there are a lot of seperate sections that contain different thoughts Marcus had.Even though a great deal of knowledge can be gained through reading this book, there are some boring parts. However, these are easy to skip over.Over all, I would definately recommend this book."
3,Falls short,"I have owned this title for a number of years and enjoyed it when I first read it. The emperor sought to be a living model of the philosopher-ruler typified by Plato in ""The Republic"". Had Marcus Aurelius lived the totality of what he wrote in his ""Meditations"",he would have been great indeed! History tells of him being a fierce persecutor of the Christians. Many innocent people died by his orders since they would not renounce their faith. A leader-philosopher can also be judged on his treatment of the most defenseless of the citizenry (or subjects). He fancied to be a Stoic at heart but certainly was not a genuine humanitarian."
4,"A light, fun read!","I definitely enjoyed reading this novel, it is a fun read and worthy of recommendation. It is not as engaging of a style as I normally prefer -- I did not feel as compelled to keep reading when I knew I had to put it down for awhile -- but the story is definitely entertaining."
5,Excellent blend of fantasy and sci-fi,What a treat this book was. I picked it up in a used bookstore and can't wait to delve into the rest of Stasheff's books.The hero Rod Gallowglass is one of the most enjoyable heroes I have read in a long time. His adventures on a world where elves and magic exist are one of a kind. When the book started I thought I misread the back of the book and was reading a science fiction story but the fantasy element soon came into play and they both combined to make a truly wonderful story.I recommend this book highly.
3,Average collection,"Another anthology of John Long's favorite climbing literature. This compendium includes excerpts from books and articles from climbing magazines. Some of the material is repeated from his other collections. His essay, `The Green Arch', seems to be in all his books as a matter of course. If you're a fan of climbing literature, you'll probably have a lot of the selections included from the original source, I did. However, Long did turn me on works that are out-of-print and/or hard to find in their original form. For this reason this anthology is a worthy addition to anyone's bookshelf."
1,manufacturer defect,"Our air conditioner, when plugged in, makes a horrific racket. Some sort of manufacturing defect. We can't seem to repair it and it would cost us to ship it back to the seller. It's 200 lbs. In addition, Amazon's policy is that it will not accept marketplace purchases postmarked beyond one week past the ship date. It took more than a week from the ship date to arrive on our doorstep, so we are stuck with this hunk of cr*p."
1,Sick and evil,"In general I do not write reviews of bad films but this one is so sick and evil I feel I need to warn people about it. Basically it describes how a group of misfit teenagers form a gang centered around their love affairs with firearms. I'm not using the word ""love affair"" here metaphorically either. Maybe it was intended as some sort of parable but its moral values are so confused and corrupted it is difficult to see any good coming of it. I couldn't watch the final predictable bloodbath, I just felt too nauseous. Do not watch this pretentious, awful film. Above all do not let any children see it."
2,ok brush,"I bought this brush w/the hopes it would better than synthetic bristle brushes and it does give my hair more shine, but the bristles fall out everytime I use it.I would not reccomened this brush"
4,"Golden tooth, golden music","N'toni denti D'Oro (= Antonio with the golden tooth) is the only male performer of the old Capeverdean tradition of batuku. Here, he presents this style in both it varieties, sambuna and finason.His group includes the rare cimboa, a one-string fiddle, which very few knows how to play properly today. N'toni (77 years old) is the rock star of the batukaderas - I saw him on a concert in Cape Verde - impressing! The girls were shaking, drumming to his directions.The lyrics in batuku are about historical matters and more educational or moral advice. N'toni sticks to tradition. He prefers to stay away from politics. This is a very good introduction into batuku. I also recommend: Terrero's CD: Xubenga.Want to know more about batuku? http://home.no.net/oaa/batuku.htm"
2,I've seen better,"I own this album since 2001. At the beggining i listen to it several times and love the whole thing. But, i rapidly lose my interest for it. Maybe, one or three times a year i give it another try, but... When, i see here that this album deserved more than four stars i was surprised. For me the drum is a weak point. I find it conventional and it don't fit well the music. The snare sound ridiculous and the playing got no feeling, a computer could have done better. Another point is the choir in latin. I heard the latin lyrics somewere else and it appears that the band copy paste already existing christian choirs themes (ex. Agnus Dei, Solima) Knowing that, the music become rediculous, and i'm sure that the meaning of the choirs lyrics have no link with the main lyrics. Bands that are similar to them and that in my sense are more better are Kovenant, Acturus and Evergrey. This, tree have never lose my attention. Look for them."
1,music for the mindless,"I was thoroughly UNimpressed by this cd. I was expecting SOME kind of actual singing. What I received was a cd of mindless growling and roaring. If you enjoy this kind of music, well....dare I say your IQ has slipped a few of points? Or you may not have much to work with in the first place."
1,Never received it,"I ordered this, but got something totally different in the mail. They credited me and I sent the jewelry back but told them I still wanted the trumpet necklace. Never received it."
4,Shark Island Rocks your World,"I don't know about five stars for the album but the opening song, ""Paris Calling"", one of my all time favorite hard rock songs, is worth six stars alone. Song two, ""Shake for Me"" also is a great song and reminds me of Alice Cooper.Lead Singer, Richard Black, has an excellent technique and does a super job. Songs three through ten are good as well(at least four stars) and ""Get Some Strange"" is another fabulous song. This should have been a big hit but just as it was released Nirvana and Pearl Jam came on the scene with grunge.If I were to compare Shark Island with anybody the obvious comparison would be Guns and Roses or Great White and there ain't nut'n wrong with that!KILLER CUTS:Paris CallingShake Foe MeSomebody's FallingPassion to AgesGet Some StrangeWhy Should I BelieveThe Chain"
5,Tiger Fans,I bought this as a gift for one of my friend's who is a nurse. She loved it and said it's one of the best brands of scrubs you can buy
3,"Good writing, good concept, bad editor","This book leads you through the basics of Cisco and internetworking concepts. It is best understood if you have a small 25xx series router in front of you to go along with as you read. I have found several errors mostly in the question/answer sections of this book. If you are sure you are correct in an answer check it on the router, YOU may be correct after all.CD ROM with this book is horrible Overall: good book 3+"
3,Good,"I just finished reading this book.If you are a novice to the cisco world,this is not the place to start.The book is excellent if your are familiar with Internetworking and Cisco routers. After I purchased the book,I read a lot of negative reviews concerning the topics not covered for the CCNA test.I promptly took the book back.Upon further review,I repurchased the book and finally read it.The book glosses over a lot of material that warrants more in depth coverage,such as VLANS,switching,and Basic Cisco configurations.However,The chapter on subnetting is excellent.I would say wait for the SYBEX book if you want to make a purchase of real CCNA text."
1,Buy Another Book,"If you want a good book(s) that will help you pass the CCNA exam this is not your book. I would recommend buying the Sybex and both the ICRC and the ACRC books by Cisco Press.Good luck,Michael"
2,Try using an editor,"Generous with 2 stars. It is unbelievable that some of the questions I saw on this book and CD are wrong. They should have atleast edited the book. I feel for people who rely on just this book to help them. I am sure most people have told you that the Cisco press series of books is much better. I bought it specifically for the test questions. I found the CD to be a poor tool as well. These were not practice tests, but just the same questions in the book(at the end of every chapter), on CD in HTML format. If you want practice tests, I would suggest Sylvan prometric site, but get the Cisco Press publication for the test you are taking."
4,Ideal text for learning ip addressing quickly,"This book isn't perfect, but the text is readable, and I have yet to find a better reference for ip addressing and subnetting. The best way to pass this exam is to thoroughly read the Cisco ICRC manual, then use this for further reading. My background is in business rather than IT, and I believe that even those new to networking can pass as long as they know their stuff. Myles Urquhart BCom(Hons),Dip.Bus,CCNA"
1,Don't waste your money!,"This book sucks! Answers to self test questions are sometimes wrong...so are some routing concepts and configuration examples. When in doubt, use the original ICRC and ACRC training manuals. They probably did not QC this book!!! There is no AppleTalk in the exam, don't waste your time to read those sections. There are also ISDN questions in the exam not covered in this book. Don't just count on this book to pass the exam! The only thing I like about this book is the hardcover, so I give it a 1 star.CCNA, CCDA, BSEE, MBA"
1,Weak and needs to be rewritten. Doesn't cover the test.,"I agree with the other reviews on this page: This book does not have the necessary information to pass the CCNA exam. You have to know your OSI, CDP, subnetting and ISDN. All of these are not covered in enough depth to pass the exam. Get the Cisco press book and Sybex CCNA books instead."
3,This book explains subneting very well,"The biggest problem with the book is that ISDN is covered in half a page. Presentation and Application layer protocols are not described adaquately enough. However, this book deserves 3 stars for being very concise and informative in explaining subnet masking."
1,Doesn't have the information for the CCNA exam.,"This book is severely missing CCNA exam information. I received a lot of really hard questions on the exam relating to the OSI. I studied what they had in this book but I was really blown away by how hard the test was. I also didn't know anything about CDP because it had only one page in this book, but I got asked some super hard questions about that protocol on the test. I didn't even know it was a protocol. This book is weak at best."
1,Too Many Errors!!!!,"This book is really bad for someone who doesn't have any too much experience in networking. Key points are just blurted out, while easy concepts seem to go on for pages. Finally, the question and answers are very error prone. Will confuse you if you don't take the time to reference errors."
1,"Yes, this book is a bad as all the other reviews!","This book is really a bad book, and the people who actually bought this book and write reviews all said the same thing ""It should not be called CCNA"". All the readers are correct. This book has all the wrong information for the exam. Do yourself a favor and stay with the Cisco press books. You won't go wrong there as you can here."
3,Exam Objectives Oriented,I would recommend this book as a supplementary. ICRC (Cisco Press) edited by Laura Chappell or the ICRC course is essential for 80% of the info required to pass the exam. Once after going thru' ICRC and then study exams specifics will allow better recollection especially during the exams (that was my strategy...Passed 87%).
3,"Well, at least I passed.","I agree with the reader from Washington, the book has a lot of good information but is lacking material for the exam. The sections on wide area networking (Frame Relay and ISDN, specifically) were not ""in-depth"" enough. Some of those questions caught me off-guard. The best part of this book is the author's tips for taking the test. Those worked for me, but the test was certainly intimidating on first pass."
2,Try again,"I found this book to be a boring read. I know it is a study guide, but it was still very difficult to follow. The boring text is coupled with poor formatting and numerous errors of fact. There are several places where you are referred to particular page, diagram or table only to find the information is not there. I never did get the CD to work."
2,Not for the newbie,"This book is packed with good information on Lan/Wan technology. But I found it poorly organized and some times hard to follow. Too often terms or concepts are thrown in with out sufficeint explination. This seemed to be written for an experienced wan tech looking for a review and not a lesser trained lan tech. If you fall under the cisco ""newbie"" lable, try some thing from sybex or another publisher first."
3,good info but no help on the actual exam,I thought that the book was well written until I took the cisco exam. I needed a 68% and I received a 64%. Close but no cigar. I found that it covered some info that was not on the exam and it did not cover alot of the stuff that was on the exam. I am going to try the Sybex next.
3,Great book but many mistakes,"This seems to be a well organized book with the exception of all the mistakes. With a little previous Cisco router experience, most of the mistakes can be easily noticed. I would still recommend this book though."
2,This book was obviously rushed thru the press....,"I purchased this book as a suppliment to my Cisco ICRC and ACRC class materials. As I began to read this book, the errors were easy to find. Stay with the course materials from the classes. The book makes to many errors to rely upon as a study guide for the exam. As I took the Cisco ACRC class, I was able to find way to many mistakes in this book. Unlike Mr. Know-it-all from LA, I don't claim to know it all, as nobody does. But you don't have to be a genious to see the errors in this one."
3,Adequate if supplemented by other Cisco materials,"This book is an adequate prep tool for the CCNA exam if you utilize some additional materials and field experience. I would recommend Cisco Router Configuration, as well as Cisco IOS Configuration Fundamentals, both from Cisco Press. The Osborne book DOES NOT cover all the material you will see on the exam, although it does a nice job of covering most of the major topics. The self-tests at the end of each chapter provide a good review of the chapter concepts, but don't rely on these as ""real world"" exam questions. Also, don't waste your time with the simulated exam offered from the publisher's website via the included CD - it's a worthless regurgitation of the self-tests, and its scoring system is flawed. Beware of typos in this text! (Most of them are fairly obvious if you have some networking experience.) Hopefully these problems will be corrected in a future edition of the text."
2,A few too many errors/a few too many irrelevant topics...,"This book had some errors in the practice question section; if you are new to Cisco routers, you end up having doubts about what is supposed to be the right answer. In addition, while it certainly covered all of the topics, it adds information that probably won't be tested."
2,"Syngress, Inc","I found this book to live up the expectations I have come to expect from the Syngress Study guides, poorly written, not focused on what you need. Its more of just a dump of everything without regard to exam objectives."
2,Book isn't complete.,"First of all, thanks to all who've written reviews on this book, you were an immense help. Second, I found this book to be incomplete. As everyone else has said, the parts covering the OSI model were not in-depth enough; the questions I tested on were very specific. Also, there was not enough on switching. Although you could pass the test without doing to well on switching (as I did) it needed more than just VLANs. Bottom line: This book isn't bad, but if you've taken ICRC, that book will probably be better."
1,This book is full of errors -- mainly contradictions,"The answers to the end of chapter questions contradict the text. Which is right, the text or the q&a section? I would buy a different book."
1,I think I got the wrong test or wrong book for the test,"Like the other reviews, I think this book is for the wrong test. Maybe Cisco changed the test or something. I don't dislike the book as much as the other reviewers, but I don't know anything about Cisco routers either. I just know I can't find the answers to the test that I received which was 70 questions not 44 like the book claims."
3,Good reference,"There were some errors in the book, but over all it was a good reference to pass the CCNA certification."
1,A must to avoid,"Bought this book and got burned just like everybody else. If it were possible to assign a negative star rating, this collection of dis-information would get five of those. Any material in these pages that isn't completely erroneous or irrelevant to the subject matter covered by the test is available absolutely free on the Cisco website or other similar sites. I'm currently pursuing the CCNP & CCDP certifications. My experience with the above title has put me off this publisher completely. And, as of this writing, they're the only ones offering texts supporting the CCNP/CCDP test curriculums. Save yourself the money and the time when it comes to this book -- it isn't even a worthwhile reference."
3,Not That Bad! I sure learned something!,"This book is an adequate ""study guide"". It has some errors but not as many as some have stated. The review questions were good and there were many more of them than in the Sybex CCNA book. This book also covers areas like switching and ATM LANE better than the Sybex book. I really liked the instructor comments section in each chapter (First good explanation of ""local significance"" of DLCIs I've seen in any book). However, don't rely on this book as your only means of study. If you want to really ""learn"" the material, I recommend the ""Intro to Cisco Router Configuration"" by Cisco Press, the Sybex ""CCNA"" book, and all the Cisco web resources you can get your hands on. The Sybex book is more readable and more geared to the test I took. I passed the CCNA exam yesterday with a score of 92."
1,"Didn't prepare me for the test, I failed!","I worked with hands-on went through the practice test questions, and failed the test. this book does not prepare you for the test. I don't think any one book will prepare you for this exam. However, this has to be one of the worst ones."
1,"Some usefull info, but not for the CCNA exam","This book is ""ok"" for basic CISCO routing info but does not prepare you for the CCNA exam. I passed, but this book was off on many areas. I hope the new approach that Osbourne is taking actually works for writing their future manuals."
1,Sloppy - feels thrown together,"The book was not checked thoroughly as it has many errors in the test and in referencing figures. The CD is pretty unimaginative and has some dead links on. Basically nothing more than an html version of the book. Can't say the book really helped my understanding, seems to think tables and tables of information can substitute for good explanations. I would try something else."
4,I dont get some of these bad reviews,The book has alot of very useful info. I see some of the others gave a it poor review (and I also see 1 or 2 of those have their own books out). I never buy just one book especially on a subject this complex. The only thing I see thats not relavent to the test is the Appletalk section (I am sure I will need it later). The one thing I would like to see is the errors that were mentioned put onto their web site.
3,Not as bad as everyone says...,"I personally do not feel that the book is as bad as everyone says. I went through the ICRC class by GKN. It was a very good class. I read this book twice and studied the sample questions. I'm now a CCNA.I used the online web based test questions -- definitely a mistake. If you thought there were mistakes in the book, you should see this test. It can't even figure out the number of questions you got correct, correctly.Anyway, I took and passed the CCNA test yesterday and here's my 2 cents:If you think you can read this book and pass the test you are WRONG. You better have some backgound and experience. Know the OSI model, like your mother and then study it some more, and don't bother with Appletalk. (too late for me...)"
5,"A very good book, particularly for practice questions","I have been looking for CCNA study material and this is the only thing out there even close to worth using. It covers in detail almost everything covered in ICRC. The IP configuration section is excellent, although some of the Novell IPX stuff is dated by 5.0...but that's a quibble. I will be taking the exam next week and expect this book to have been helpful. I used the Global Knowledge MCSE books to pass my MCSE last summer."
4,Good book coupled with ITM CD and HPSDC book,"I first read the following material Cisco recommends for the CCNA exam, including:o the ITM CDo the Cisco documentation CD (mainly for good OSI model stuffo the HPSDC booko several TCP/IP books on routing, etc. etc.I read the book for about a week, took the test, and passed it. I'm assuming the other people didn't like it because they wanted a ""gimme"" test like the MCSE stuff.Overall, this is a good book to add to your CCNA study curriculum."
1,"Doesn't prepare you for anything, especially the test!","This book was so rushed into production, that is doesn't even help you with anything. It does not have the test objectives covered. I recommend the Sybex book which has the test objectives listed at the beginning of each chapter."
4,READ THE BOOK----PASS THE TEST,"If you have any experience with Cisco products a carefull read of this book and practice questions will help you pass the test. WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS, WHEN ARE THE OTHER FOUR IN THIS SERIES GOING TO BE RELEASED?"
2,The book is a good reference for basic networking concepts,"The book was obviously written by multiple people, of which only one had any clue as to how real networks operate. While reading the book I noticed dozens of mistakes, not to mention old syntax for alot of the commands being explained. The book covers all the topics on the CCNA exam so if nothing else it provides a general concept for which direction you need to study..In short, if you're reading this book to get your CCNA plan on spending hours on a network playing with the routers and the various routing protocols.Steve Smith CCIE"
1,Poor study guide for exam,"This book does not prepare you for the exam. I read this book, Laura Chappel's ICRC book, and Lamalle's CCNA book. This book was a total waste of money. I would give it zero stars if I could. The ICRC book is a good foundation and I found it very helpful. Lamalle's CCNA guide is the best for studying for the exam. If you want to pass the test this book is a must. I passed the test. To make sure read the ICRC book and then study Lamalle's CCNA guide. If you want to save money you can get by with Lamalle's book plus experience."
3,Average,"Format of book was excellent but felt that it's content was a bit on the weak side. Did not give me everything I needed to pass exam the first time, although did give a good foundation of most exam theories. Felt the Introduction section of the actual test was not covered in the book anywhere near what someone needs to pass the test. The other sections were great though. Had some questions on the test, (about 10 out of 70) that never heard of before by reading the book."
1,This book DOES NOT address the test objectives. BAD BOOK,"This book does not prepare the reader for the CCNA exam, and is wrought with errors. I was very disappointed with this book. !!!!!Shame on you for keeping this book in print!!!!!!"
1,This book is a waste of our Money,"I Purchased this book in hopes that it would help me pass the CCNA. You know what it didn't, it doesn't cover any thing about ISDN Protocols E,I,Q or give you the rest of the information you need to pass the ISDN part of the Test. It doesn't cover the 5 step of Data Encapsulation very well. It also made no comment about steps of VIP port asignment in a Cisco 7500. I found this book very lacking in knowledge in general, But the One Good part was the Sections Tilted From the Class Room which where Extremely Well written. I ended up buying CCNA Exam Notes which is an excellent book to help you pass the CCNA!!Joseph L. Degele CCNA MCSE"
2,Not as bad as the reviews,"This is not that bad of a book. However, if you are using it as the sole preparation for the exam, you are in trouble. I haven't seen the Sybex book yet, but I would consider purchasing that one also."
1,If I could rate it lower I would!!,"I bought this book to prepare for the CCNA. To my disbelief I found a part of this book that was COMPLETLY WRONG. I have been through ICRC, ACRC, & IMRC all taught by GKN. This book did not cover a great deal of the questions on the CCNA test. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!"
3,"Great energy drink, bad shipping","This is a great tasting all natural energy drink. And if Amazon.com could ship it consistently (or even carry it consistently) then I'd be more inclined to give it four or five stars. As is, Amazon.com sometimes removes the product from listing and other times takes a month and a half to ship the drink. I'm an Amazon Prime member and a huge fan of both Amazon and Amazon Prime, but this is one product where they really fail to deliver.I've switched to Rockstar Juiced -- It's cheaper per case, shipping is free direct from the Rockstar web site and they delivered my cases to me in just four days at no cost. That's the way it should be."
1,Worst tasting energy drink I have ever had,"I am a regular consumer of energy drinks. GURU energy drinks are without a doubt the worst tasting drinks I have ever consumed. They are bitter, sour, and disgusting all at once. Words can not describe how disgusting these drinks really are."
3,It's all right,"I should have tried single cans before I jumped to buy this 24-pack. The taste is too mild and sweet. The energizing effect is only comparable to coffee (it contains 125mg of caffeine per can, slightly more than one medium coffee). It might be an all right chick drink. But I wouldn't call it a nice energy drink. I am amazed to read that everybody gave it 5 stars.*PS*: it has weird unsetting effect on me. Energizing effect is actually minimal... I deeply regret my purchase."
1,Try One First,One sip and it went down the drain...glad I only bought one can before I ordered a case! I would give it zero stars if it was allowed.
3,Poor recording but high on the fun scale,"Unfortunately, Tony Visconti had very little to work with when remixing this album. In particular, the ever-impressive piano parts sound muffled, as if only a faraway microphone covered by a pillow was picking up the sound. The liner notes explain the sound problems to an extent, but it still seems like a crime that this historic concert was recorded so badly.Despite the technical problems, this album has many highlights, including a veeeeeery long Width of a Circle and the most moving rendition I've heard of My Death.If you don't mind some DIY rough edges, you will find plenty to enjoy in the manic playing of the Spiders From Mars, and, of course, Bowie retiring Ziggy onstage is of no small significance."
2,a promise is a promise,I think this book was not worth buying. It really did not tell about the lives of the two ladys. It was all about faith.I throught I would be reading how they lived from year to year. I hope the sales from this book helped the family and I am glad that I only spent $1.99 on this
5,Most inspiring book I have ever read,"This book captured my attention. I read it in one setting. I did not want to put it down.It move me, inspired me and made me want to give more of myself to those who may one day need mylove in such a way."
2,not my kind of reading,"this story is true, but it drags on every page, I have read many true stories that were written to keep you turning the pages, not this one."
2,A Mother's Love,"A true story of a mother's love for her comatose daughter, and her constant care...Her catholic religion comes in to play when she sees visions by her daughter's bedside..."
5,EVERY PARENT...EVERYONE SHOULD READ !,"I so wish I were rich, so I could buy more copies of this book and give away. I buy as many as I can from the used bin. I don't think the money gets back to Kaye and Edwarda when I buy the used books, but at least the message is getting out.I give the books to friends. send them to those indivisuals in positions's of authority, ie: mayors, politicians, civic leaders, friends and relatives. I highly encourage everyone to buy as many copies as you can and give away. new or used, the money and message gets spread. if you have any doubts as to whether or not this book is this good, at least buy one copy for yourself and read it.Dr. Dyer has much good info for everyone, above and beyond ""A Promise is A Promise""thank you so much Kaye and Edwarda !!cowboy bob !!"
5,You can feel the faith in the pages,This is one of the most inspiring stories I have read. I had the opportunity to see Kaye Oberra on a rare appearance she made in the Detroit area. There was a feeling of serenity and even joy about her. After I read the book I couldn't help but believe That Edwarda will awaken to further the message of her life. Thank You for this lovely book!
5,Throw out all yer other cd's - this is all ya needs!!,Big Youth. Natty Universal Dread. 3-disc bonanza. 51 tracks. Covers period between 1973-79. Blood & Fire. D J/Reggae at its most highest. You probably own some other cd's. Throw them out. This is all you need. 'Nuff discussion.
3,3 Stories to Recommend,"This is a compilation of short stories. All 16 stories are based on four letter words. While ""Fear"" & ""Loss"" were fine, I recommend:Spin: A silent comic on the connection of music and memoryBlam: An excellent metaphor on the effect of living with keeping major secrets from the people closest to you.Junk: A story on how otherwise very good or benign things can become tragically devalued when a relationship dissolves."
5,Love Christmas Oldies/Smoothies,"Love the smooth voice that reminds me of my younger years when Motown and Smooth Jazz with still popular. First MP3 I've ever purchased and put it on my Fire HD 8.9""."
5,Classic and contemporary Christmas joy from a formidable voice,"Already well-regarded as perhaps the most talented singer to be fronted by Jimmy Jam Harris & Terry Lewis, the two of them and O'Neal created this Christmas album in 1988 that is definitely not your standard holiday album. Features several original songs including ""Our First Christmas"" and ""Remember Why (It's Christmas)"" that bear the distinctive and enjoyable flavor regularly associated with most music produced by the famous Jam & Lewis production team. There's also an outstanding cover of Donny Hathaway's classic ""This Christmas"" and whoever thought that anybody could make such a funky good time out of ""The Little Drummer Boy?"" If you're looking to differentiate your Christmas celebration from the standard status quo, having this album playing is one good way to do it."
5,My Gift to You is nice.,The title track is awesome! Remember Why should be the theme for the season. His version of the Christmas Song is GOOD! It's a shame that it does not get the air play that others get.
5,My Xmas Music,This is a jolly good cd full of Xmas spirit that makes the holidays a happy time. One of my favorite Xmas Cd's.
3,A qiuck view,This book contains accounts of many important events in early Yavapai county history albiet from this author's information which has proven in later years to not always be totally accurate. He was however able to interview several of the old timers involved with the events as the book was written just after the turn of the century. Overall worth the small price of the book and a worthwhile addition to an Arizona history library.
3,Sorry but Just ok,I thought planet o and some other albums of his was a lot better I brought this because of the good reviews I will just say to me He has improved alot becoming one of my favs but this album was not for me
1,Junk,"I wouldn't recommend buying these unless you'd like to display them only. I brought two of them to use for a Scouting event. I threw them at a target about 10 times each then the handles seperated from the head. A very bad design, the handles are not wedged into the head. They were held in by an aluminum pin. I tried to return them and the seller had said that they were not to be thrown into trees and that since the handle broke from the head it was my problem since they were so cheap. Duh! Why call them a throwing axe? What was I going to throw them into marshmallows! DON'T BUY!!"
4,Direct and Authoritative,"The SEO proces can seem daunting and Ms Seda recognizes that fact. She gives a methodical, if not also logical trail to follow and has obviously done laborious research; which pays off. It may appear technical and dry, but the details are necessary to convey the ins and outs of SEO. Bravo and it will remain a part of my business reference library."
2,"Outdated, outdated, outdated","I'm sure this book was cutting edge when it was first published in February of 2004, but now it's for the most part outdated. For the absolute beginner to this area, there are some good general points, but references to long-since defunct or consolidated web companies (Urchin, Inktomi,etc) make it difficult to understand just what's still relevant. Google and Yahoo (and soon Microsoft) are defining the new landscape of this field as we speak...Try the new book from IBM press, ""Search Engine Marketing""....chock full of the latest (as late as can be in this field) info."
3,It's a Good Read for the Money,"It's not a bad overview of Search Engine Marketing, but I wouldn't recommend stopping with this read.Some of the things Catherine covers are good and don't change. As an example, the chapters that provide Copyrighting Tips and that talk about how to improve conversions on Landing Pages. Even though they are only providing a glimpse as to what you need to know, many of those things do not change from year to year.Other things however are going to require the reader further study. What one needs to focus on today to get good rankings is quite different from the day this book was written.An example is paid inclusion; someone reading this should know that you don't need to pay to get indexed now. Sitemaps, getting backlinks from ranked sites that get regularly crawled, directories, blogs etc..But it's good to absorb whatever one can. Even if someone comes away with a few ideas they didn't have before to improve their bottom line, it's worth the small price of this book."
3,Loved this for four months when it started falling apart,"This was purchases this for my four yr old son who loves construction trucks. He loves this toy so much he sleeps with it. It is made of durable metal & plastic. The first thing to break on this was the plastic that goes up the boom or arm of the truck. Today the metal pin that holds the bucket to the boom fell out and cannot be pushed back in. The tracks are removable and my son loves to remove them. It is a nice truck, I just wish that it had lasted longer."
3,READ EVERYTHING BEFORE BUYING THESE FROM HERE,"I HAVE THE ZR SERIES IN MY TRUCK AND WHILE I GOT THEM FOR ALOT LESS, THEY SOUND GOOD, BUT FOR THE PRICE, YOU COULD GO BETTER. WHAT I MEAN BY READ EVERYTHING, IS THAT THE IMAGE AND PRODUCT DESCRIPTION SHOW/STATES ZR, IF YOU LOOKK AT THE PRODUCT DETAILS, IT SAYS TR650."
5,Something Corporate is something else!,"Audioboxer starts strong with the upbeat ""(Hurricane) The Formal Weather Pattern"" and ends even stronger with the soft, pure ear candy that is ""Walking By."" ""Walking By"" is my favorite song not only on this EP, not only by this band, but in the world. Andrew's vocals couldnt be better and his piano leaves nothing to be desired. ""Little"" is also a great song and the chorus gets you singing by its second time through. ""Punk Rock Princess"" is another upbeat fun song. The only song I am not crazy about is ""If You C Jordan"" but even though I am not crazy about it, I like it enough to listen to it every so often. Though there are only six songs on the EP, it is worth keeping on repeat for days. A great effort by a great band. Definitely worth the money."
4,"Not Emo (despite some people's belief), but great anyway","When i bought this i thought it'd be a great Emo EP, and though i was disappointed to find out it wasn't even emo (though iF yoU C jordan is almost), but it's still one of the best punk/semi-emo CD's i've heard in a long time. Well worth the price. Listen to If You C Jordan, Punk Rock Princess (though a little tacky) especially."
5,Every Soco fan should own,"If you are an advid SoCo fan, this cd is a must have! It has the original recording of ""Hurricane""--which is a great song! Esp. the solo piano toward the end of the song...it gives me chills!Andrew recently explained during a show that ""Walking By"" (which is one of the best Something Corporate songs ever recorded!) was a song that almost didn't make the cut. The album was finished and in an attempt to impress her, he begged his fellow bandmates if he could record the song. Being the ""hopeless romantics"" like himself, they said sure.In the end, he ended up marrying that girl was always ""walking by."" :)"
4,Tight EP,"If you already ownLeaving Through The Windowyou'll already have a few of these songs. Repeats are Hurricane, If you C Jordan, and Punk Rock Princess.This leaves you with three great songs Bad Day, Little, Walking By of which 'Little' is my favorite (but thats just because I like up tempo songs) 'Walking By' is the better song and if you like Something Corporate at all you should definitely check it out.My recommendation is to buyLeaving Through The Windowand go download Bad Day, Little, Walking By. Individually I give Bad Day ***, Little ****, Walking By ***** in stars."
5,stunning music,I first heard this band on a road trip with friends and instantly fell in love with their music. They blend infectious melodies with well thought out and indepth lyrics. They take you through a wide spectrum of emotions. And when they have finished wrapping you in their world you won't be the same. I definatly recommend this album and downloading Konstantine from MP3.com it's a beatiful song(my favorite). I also recommend Seeing them live they completely rock!
1,The next big thing - NOT,"Received the CD yesterday from one who felt these guys were the next big thing ... politely disagree.From song one I was predicting the riffs and the music was like Weezer meets Oasis. This is not the next big thing. My advice to these guys ... spend some more time resting on your garage band king status with your punk rock princess (as stated by the predictable cliche lyrics in track 3). On a positive note, it was worth the price ..."
5,Friggin' Sweet,"This band is like a combination of Ben Folds Five and Third Eye Blind. The piano lead songs are soulful and invigorating. Listen to the first song on the LP ""Hurricane"" and the first single ""If yoU C Jordan"". It will give you a good feel for what this group sounds like."
2,Okay,"Honestly, this doesn't seem at all different from any of the other albums that I have heard something corporate do. Earlier and a little bit better than the acclaimed ""Leaving through the window"" it still has its major influence and feeling. Now, I've heard a few mistaken words saying that this music is indie-rock which can be understandable since the uprise of the ever-so-famous bright eyes, but, in my opinion this is either A: pop-punk too ashamed to admit it, B: piano-rock that sounds like train. Either way it really doesn't resemble what is on the market for indie-rock or underground indie-rock as has been explained in another review on ""underground bands"" which is, again, mistaken."
4,2 for 2 a pleasure!,If you are a fan of Jay and the Americans grab this one quick its not easy to find! My mom played Livin Above Your Head when I was a little girl and I have grown to love all of the songs they have put out. The Grass Will Sing For you is one of my favorites. These 2 albums are not for casual fans of the group if you want to hear them just sing hits leave it along but if you are like me and can listen to them sing the phone book its worth it to get these 2 albums.
5,the bible,This is the Bible of telemarketing. You must read this book by the father of predictive dialing.!
5,"Action, Romance, Controversy.","Wow!This was on great book!I have never read a book by Gary E. Parker but he could easily become a favorite author.I have always loved the Civil war, and will read almost any book I can get my hands on, concerning the Civil war. And Secret Tides did not disappoint!There were quite a few plot twists, and very interesting characters.This book is pre-Civil war. Its about the overseer of The Oaks plantation and his family.It also talks about the plantation owners, and a few of the slaves.When you start this book you are gonna want to have the second book in the series close by.This book leaves off in quite a mixed up mess.There is lots of mystery, some action, romance, and a bunch of controversy.What more could you want?I would definitely recommend this book!"
1,Snapped in half,I had this bat for a year and one month. It snapped at the handle today and they won't replace it because its over the one year warranty. I barely used it during that time though and it shouldn't have broken
1,Poor Product,"This bat broke after 2 games, then the replacement broke after 2 games. I'm no giant and my teammates know there's something wrong with this bat as none of them had seen anyone break any type of softball bat, let alone the same person breaking two within a 4 game stretch! Since they only allow one replacement within a year, they returned my broken bat that I had sent explaining to them that I don't tell just 13 people about a product or company that doesn't live up to its billing, but I tell just about everyone I can. As a matter of fact, I tell people on the teams we play against about Miken and no one on my team will be purchasing another product from them."
3,Good introduction but not enough depth,Explanations are a bit rushed. I wish the author took more time to explain the logic behind some of the equations.
5,Hardcore gone country,"Sporting members of a couple of the best screamy bands of the last decade (Botch/These Arms Are Snakes and Harkonnen), Roy delivers all the drive and depth I came to expect from them as kids but in a traditional rock and roll flavor. The songs range from country to noisy rock to ballads, but they never disappoint.Fans of Lucero, the Replacements and maybe even Billy Bragg will dig these guys. One of my friends said ""the best Beatles songs not by the Beatles"", though I'm not sure I agree. All I know is I own all their albums.Full disclosure -- I know some of these guys and have been fans of their various projects for a long time. Still, I'm enough of a music snob that I wouldn't write anything if I didn't love the band."
5,"Very good, Very fun. Very Cuban.","Maravillosa y muy comica, como hacia años no veia ninguna comedia de mi gente cubana."
5,Alexis Valdez es un vacilon,"Esta comedia critica y se burla de la relación entre españoles y cubanos. Los españoles y muchos turistas se aprovechan de la miseria en Cuba, los matrimonios por conveniencia para salir de la isla y de las cubanas. Es una critica a la situacion de la isla y de como tambien tratan a los inmigrantes ilegales en la madre patria.Un tema fuerte, pero que se trata adecuadamente a nivel de comedia.Alexis es increible cuando asume la doble personalidad del rico espanol que muere cuando tiene un encuentro sexual con una mujer cubana...la recomiendo para un buen rato!"
4,LiftMaster 81M,The remote control was easily set up and works great. The whole transcation went smoothly and fast.
2,"Correct remote, but arrived with dead battery","If I hadn't read someone else's review making that comment, it would not have occured to me to try a new battery. I was about to send it back when I noticed that. Battery was too dead to connect with opener at 12"" , thought they sent me wrong one."
2,dead battery,the product itself is great when it has a battery that works. I received the product and the battery was dead. Had to purchase a battery in order to for product to work. Unacceptable.
5,Does what its suppose to do,"Having previously purchased this particular transmitter, I needed another one so this was an obvious choice. Both have worked flawlessly."
1,Didn't work,"I have a ""liftmaster professional"" garage door opener but this remote didn't work with it."
2,Instructions Unclear,"Did not operate with the instructions included.Out of 5 stars this would rate 2 stars.Thanks,Bobby."
5,Works great!!,"I bought this remote due to the fact that we had lost one of them. It arrived on time, took not even 5 minutes to put the clip on and program it for my opener....came with a 5 year battery also. Highly recommended!!"
5,I'm a satisfied customer!,"The Liftmaster 81LM remotes work great on my old, garage door. I purchased two - just to have a back up in case they go out of stock before I need a new garage door. Couldnt be happier at finding them for such a good price on Amazon.My local garage door store wanted to charge me 3 times the cost! Thank you, Amazon, for once again, coming to the rescue!"
3,Works but weak signal,"I Linked this to the garage opener using the supplied battery. It works but I have to lower the visor in my car, where I keep it, to get the opener to react. The signal is weak. I must be right in front of the door to get it to work.Could be the supplied battery is weak. I have not tried to replace it yet."
5,"Exactly as pictured, worked great","I bought this so my son would be able to have a remote in his car (he just started driving) and it works exactly as expected. Came quickly, packaged well, learned my opener quickly. Green button on my opener for programming. Nice."
3,One out of two,"Ordered 2. First Liftmaster was programmed per instructions and worked fine, as Liftmaster usually does. Second unit had no green ""I'm alive"" light or response and would never work. Lost half my purchase."
5,Works like a charm,"I have an older craftsman opener from 1994,the remote I was using got burned to a crisp along with my car so I needed a new one.Thinking I may have to buy a completely new opener,I gave this a try instead.Thinking it may be a shot in the dark.My unit has the green learn button,I did as the instructions said & within about 30 seconds the light on the opener blinked indicating it had learned the code.Gave it a try & lo & behold it worked.No more getting out of the car to use the wall mounted button pad."
4,Good Remote,"Remote is very easy to program. Haven't had any problems with it, so far. Would recommend and would purchase again, in the future."
4,Inexpensive and work well,"I bought a bank-owned property and found that the remote control for the garage door is missing. I called a garage door company and they tried to sell me one with a 2.5x price. I decided to search it online and found this one at Amazon. The shipping is faster than I expected. After reading the instruction, I took less than one minute to set up two remote controls. The big button is what I need, opening and closing the garage door. Many remote controls have bells and whistles. The manufactory tries to charge a premium. I'd rather spend money on other things. It has a reasonable remote range. The only downside is that it is difficult for me to open the battery cover. It is not a big deal. I highly recommend it."
4,Not the best range,"This product is great. Simple instructions, works right out of the box. The reason I took off one star is because its range is not the best. Although I am not a 100% sure if that's the problem with the receiver in my motor or the one in the remote."
1,not happy,I was not inspired at all by this book. I was really expecting alot more than just 4 pages of photographs. All of the drawings instead of photographs really make this book boring and alot harder to show certain types of technique. I would rather spend a little more cash for alot more inspiration.
1,The Chain & Crystal Book: Techniques for Bead Lovers,"Very disappointing. A mere 50 pages and nothing new on any of them. Poor pictures in b&w, only 3 or 4 color pages. There are way better books out there. Save your money."
2,Arrived shattered---replacement arrived in excellent condition,"I liked the design and size. Unfortunately, I had to return because the lid and the ladle were broken due to insufficient packaging. There was no foam, no air pillows, no wads of paper, just a tureen in a box and some ""fragile"" stickers slapped on the outside. Surprised the bowl did not break.*UPDATE*Ordered a replacement since I looked around and still could not find a better deal for a soup tureen. This one arrived in perfect condition. Will be a beautiful addition to my Thanksgiving table."
4,Beautiful yet haunting,"I am usually not a fan of short stories - I much prefer novels where I can fall in love with characters and anticipate story lines. This collection of short stories is the exception. Story after story, Orringer weaves tales of love, loss and recovery. Each story told a haunting tale, some even slightly horrific,such as Pilgrims, that I needed to put the book down and just process what happened for a few minutes. I cried, heavily, during the Isabel fish, my favorite of the stories, as the relationship between brother and sister slowly worked its way from irreparable, to hatred, to damaged yet hopeful. Note to Sixth Grade Self and What We Save are stories of hope, and I was touched by both.I strongly recommend this short story collection. The characters and their stories will stay with me for a long time."
1,No Thanks,"I read the first story and - yeeecccchhhh - weird, hopeless, depressing and horrifying pretty much sum it up. The characters in this short story all make you want to run into the light of normalcy. Morose kids, strange house, freaky grown-ups, dying mothers, screaming bratty girl who meets a truly preposterous fate, etc. etc. One might argue that Orringer is really ""deep."" If this is deep, give me shallow, please! Guess it's super hip to be hung up on the dark side.Tried to continue with the Sixth Grade Self story, just could not. Unendurable. Surely filled with angst and misery if the start was any indication.This collection goes back to the library shelf, and soon."
2,Not good,"Orringer's ""How to Breathe Under Water was an extremely dissappointing book. The stories started off pretty good, but then went absolutely nowhere. I can't imagine why they were called brilliant."
3,Mixed feelings,"I really liked ""Pilgrims."" There is true grit and substance in that story. But ""Notes to Sixth Grade Self"" is far too derivative of Lorrie Moore, and too shallow for my taste. (Junot Diaz' riff off Lorrie Moore in ""How to Date a Blackgirl"" is far more original, and takes up far more dangerous questions of race, class, etc.) I can't remember the other stories distinctly enough, and this underscores the biggest problem with the book: its repetitiveness. Not enough range, not enough originality, not enough distinction, either in subject or style. Everything is polished, smart, tasteful . . . but safe."
2,Can't finish the book,"Let me say right off that the first story, ""Pilgrims,"" is terrific. I flipped through the first few pages and decided to buy the book based on how good they were. Unfortunately, nothing else in the book matches its level of writing. The other stories are skillful but safe, repetitive, always told from the point of view of a privileged young woman, and bourgeois in a way that doesn't question its bourgeois status. I can't finish the book. And ""Notes to Sixth Grade Self"" is [bad]. ... But despite all this, she has talent and hopefully her next book will be as good as that first story."
1,Unimaginably Horrible,"This was honestly the most negative book I have read in my life. I have a clinically depressed uncle, and if he had read this book, I think he would have killed himself. I might as well have read the mind of someone about to be incarcerated in a mental hospital. The level of genius the author used to compose truly repulsive perspectives and sordid plots is commendable, but I would rather watch psycho killer movies if I wanted a dose of lunacy. I feel sorry for anyone about to read this book. Get ready for a day or two of an oppressed immune system from the mental trauma about to be inflicted from the author's nightmare depictions of life."
4,Dont be fooled by the cover!!,"Actually, this might be the best album since a kid named eminem dropped his first beats. When you take a listen to the music laid down here it rocks. True, it may take a little while to get used to the style, but what really hoppin' music doesn't? This is an original album so if you don't like to listen to new music and experience new styles, don't go here. Most of the tracks here are slammin'. Might find a couple on here that just don't keep with the flava. All in all this is an easy recommendation for anyone that wants to hear a po white honky from the Carolina's rap better than most big names out there. I'll take this over 99% of the rap out there."
2,po white trash album,"the service was good, the tape was for my 10 year old grandson, he saw a video on tv and liked it so i ordered it not knowing the content. it wasn't the same video he saw. thanks anyway it was my fault."
5,Great Stuff for the non-christian to consider,"It ias not necessary to share the particualr beliefs with this innovative Salt Lake City band to gain an appreciation for the depth of their commitment to their music. Though I usually preferr Jazz, I found this groups message to be clean and uplifting. I would recommend that anyone who wants to explore wider boundries than the top 40 to give the Traveling Mercies a listen."
3,"Fascinating music anecdotes, but poorly written","Written by the man who founded radio station WOR in 1922, and who started the New Friends of Music in NYC a decade later. It's poorly written, edited and proofread, and his fawning over Toscanini is a bit much. But there are some fascinating anecdotes about musicians in the period of 1920-1970."
4,Review,This is a quite good CD by George Jones. I've grown up on arists like him and I liked the harmonious blend of sounds he used. Once again George Jones captures the real spirit of old time country music. His voice is strong and fills you with a sense of emotion.
2,Good but very incomplete,I was interested in Borobudur because (1) I have been there and (2) knew the Dutch family that restored it from jungle ruin. The movie narrative lacked both the history of Buddhism replaced by Islam in Indonesia and the history of its restoration. The movie was very short. The images and brief narrative were excellent.
2,MY CATS LOVE IT!,"It is way too soft for an adults hair unless the hair is ""very"" fine and thin. This would be good for a child up to maybe 5.The bristles are way too soft and come out easliy..just rubbing your hand over them makes them come out. Unfortunately, the container, once opened, can't be closed to return, plus something like this shouldn""t be returned anyway, otherwise this ""brush"" (ha) would be packed-up and headed back. But my cats like it, so atleast I can use it for something."
3,Decent introduction to karate with emphasis on self-defense,"This particular text is geared primarily toward younger karate students which really comes as no surprise as the majority of Tegner's books have been staples of school and public libraries for years.Covers the basic techniques in clear, easy to understand language.Readers looking for more spectacular displays of footwork and sparring are best advised to go to Jordan Roth's Black Belt Karate where individual techniques are covered in far greater detail.Still, in fairness to Bruce he did make karate (and judo) accessible to a great number of people through his work and deserves a great deal of credit for such even though his name barely seems to rate a mention in martial arts circles these days."
5,"Corporate radio, just go away, and don't let them change.","i think that i would cry myself to sleep for at least a couple of weeks if they allowed corporate radio ruin this band. with letters to you, i nearly crashed my car listening to it when it was casually lent to me, saying ""here, this band's pretty cool"". this is beyond anything that i have even heard in the last year. if the deftones had sex with jimmy eat world, this would be the child. when you listen, you will enjoy it very very much, but be selective of who you share this band with, because the people you choose, might not understand the magnitude and the meaning and the emotion behind this music. Purchase this now."
2,Not needed,"Okey, this album is one of those that you do not have to buy because the only two songs that are good are on ""what it is to burn."" The last two songs on it are ""techno"" and all synthetic. If you like synthetic music with drum machines, by all means, please, take a gander, or you are just one of those fans who just ""has to have all their CD's."" But otherwise you really don't need it."
3,A little too expanded with generalities,I was a little disappointed and wished the author could have givena more intriguing journey into the places and folklore she writes about.
3,Could Have Been Better,"I have every Soul Ballet cd and have been very impressed with Trip the Night Fantastic, especially, and Dial It In. I was super eager to get this CD, and super disappointed that it really isn't as great as their previous efforts. The songs lack uniqueness - they all blend together and there isn't one track that really stands out and makes you want to play it again and again. There are 10 tracks on the main cd, and then a bonus cd with 3 songs. There is also more singing/lyrics on this cd than on any previous ones; the same girl is singing in the background on many of the songs and disrupts the flow of the music. I would have liked less of her and more music that was distinguishable. However, it does still sound like Soul Ballet and you will recognize some of the beats from previous cds if you own any. I would recommend it, but not highly."
5,The best~,"I have all of Soul Ballet's CD's. This one has to be the best to date! When I played this CD for the first time, I came to the conclusion you can play Soul Ballet 24/7."
4,Not bad at all...,I am not quite sure what cd the other reviewers bought but I think this is a worthwhile effort. All musicians evolve over time and this guy is no different. I fail to see a radical departure here. There is more of a techno feel to this one but it is set against some classic Soul Ballet Sounds. As soon as you pop it in you will recognize that piano.This one can be played over and over again!
2,DONT BUY,"this album/mixtape/sampler/p.o.s. is only getting two stars because it DOES have some dope songs like the tracks by kardinal offishal, x-ecutioners, masta ace, and zion I, but almost every track is just a sample (and 4 out of 30-something isnt good either). its not worth paying $16 for samples of songs from current albums. also, lots of the ""mc's"" featured are sh!t. mos def's song isn't anything special and is not a reason to buy the cd. buy it for pharoahe monch's verse or if you got some extra cash that you dont know what to do with..."
4,4 stars,"**** Playing the Odds.This was a nice solid romance. I liked that Serena saved herself, always an attractive trait in a heroine.**** Tempting Fate.This is Diana's story. Caine's a nice guy, but he's just... there. He has no character arc. Also, I have trouble relating to Diana. Yeah, it's sad that she grew up with that nasty aunt and feeling that Justin had abandoned her, but I'm so impatient with characters who stay out of relationships for fear of being abandoned. Like love is so trivial you can just throw it away on the off chance it won't last? Bah. Nora's writing saved this one."
5,The MacGregors: Serena Cai,wonderful reading...couldn't decide how it was going to end - excitement - excellent drawing of the characters and wonderful to have it within a series....and a happy ending..
4,IRISH BLOOD,THIS BOOK IS VERY WELL WRITTEN AND CAPTIVATING FROM BEGINNING UNTIL THE END . THE AUTHOR NORA ROBERTS IS ABLE TO SHOW US WHAT IS THE REAL MEANING OF IRISH PRIDE AND ALSO THEIR FAMILY VALUES WHICH I PERSONNALLY APPRECIATE A LOT . READING THIS BOOK ALSO GAVE ME A BETTER INSIGHT ON THE MORALS OF HOW CLANS USED TO OPERATE FOR THE MCGREGORS CLAN IS A FANTASTIC ONE WITH A BEAUTIFUL FAMILY WHERE LOVE AND RESPECT FOR ONE ANOTHER IS A DAILY HABIT . THIS BOOK ALSO ALLOWED TO UNDERSTAND AND KNOW BETTER WHAT I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO IN A FAMILY TO BE BUILT . IT IS A ROMANTIC BOOK BUT SO WELL WRITTEN THAT THE STORIES OTHER THAN THE LOVE PART ARE ALSO CATCHY.
5,The MacGregors: Serana ~ Caine,Loved reading this book again I read it in the 1990's. Nora Roberts is the best.
4,NORA ROBERTS BOOK,"I FOUND THAT MY PURCHASE WAS A GOOD ONE. I HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK YET BUT ALL NORA ROBERTS BOOKS ARE GREAT! THE SERVICE, DELIVERY AND CONDITION OF THE BOOK WAS EXCEPTIONAL. I COULD NOT HAVE ASKED FOR BETTER SERVICE."
5,WONDERFUL! I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THE MACGREGORS!,"Nora Roberts has done it again. This time around we go back in time and get to know the love story of Justin and Serena Blade and Caine and Diana MacGregor. Talk about fantastic! I fell in love with them just as easily as I fell in love with their children in ""The MacGregor Brides"" and ""The MacGregor Grooms"". No wonder their kids turned out so great! My personal favorite out of the two in one, was Caine and Diana's story. Man, what a great book. You'll love it. I can't wait til the next installment of the clan comes out, ""The MacGregors, Alan and Grant"". I've already ordered it even though it hasn't yet been released. I can't wait! Also soon to be released is ""The Perfect Neighbor"" which goes into the Campbell family and ""The MacGregors, Daniel and Ian"" which includes probably the most important story of all that of Daniel and Anna MacGregor, the heads of the clan. Nora must want to kill me with the anticipation. Trust me, you'll love the MacGregors!"
5,You've got to read this book!,"I'm a latecomer to Nora Roberts, so whenever I see a book of hers that's been re-issued, I grab it. I read & loved ""The MacGregor Brides"" & ""Grooms"", so I was thrilled to read the love stories of their parents. I wasn't disappointed. These two stories were great. But I did notice one thing. These stories were written and seem to take place in 1985. The ""Brides"" & ""Grooms"" were written in 1997. If their parents were married in the '80's, how could theses kids be old enough to be married in the '90's? I guess they all have RAS (Rapid Aging syndrome)--like all the kids on soap operas!"
5,If you missed them the first time be sure to grab them now.,Serena and Caine is a wonderful introduction to the Clan MacGregor. Daniel is a one in a million character whose only goal in life is for his offspring to add to the MacGregor lines. Witty and entertaining. You'll love the family as soon as you meet them.
3,"A good read, but not a great book","Because of your review guideline and recent customer reviews I purchased three of the Mac Gregor books, at once. This one, like the MacGregor Grooms & Brides, was a light read but not great books. Would I purchase other Nora Roberts book? I don't think so! Harleguin's are just as good and allot cheaper."
4,The MacGregors Serena 4 stars ~ Caine 2 Stars,"I haven't read all of Nora Roberts books but the ones that I have read some have disappointed me and some were really good. I enjoyed Serena story Playing The Odds, that's why I gave it 4 stars.I love the way Serena is such a strong women and she goes after what she wants. She falls for Justin and want she wants she gets and she wants Justin, I loved this story between them reading along you can feel how much Justin does love Serena, he makes you fall in love with him and you see why Serena loves him too. A Great Read!!Caine ~ I can say that I did not enjoy his story at all I couldn't get into the book I couldn't wait to finish it and when I did I was so happy :)Happy Reading Lisa"
3,A realistic insight to the era,"This book helped me and my ""8"" & ""10"" year olds learn and appreciate what it was like for a young black boy during this era. For me it wasn't a page turner, but a realistic portrayal of the life of this young boy, the ship hands and those that entered his life. I do think this book was educational and this subject critical to our appreciation of what slavery meant and the impact it has had on our society."
4,A reasonable adventure,"This book about the slave trade will intrigue the young reader. My daughter read this for her 5th grade FCAT studies and I was impressed with her reaction to the story. Invariably children find readinga chore. However, this is one book that she read quite speedily. The story revolves around a young boy who decides to break out of slavery. The reader can ascertain much in the way of social and ethical challenges from this particular genre."
3,Rare Item - Snap it up!,"The screenplay was published by Studio Vista sometime in the seventies. The screenplays are formatted like a play but these scripts are not verbatim transcripts of the final movie but the actual shooting acripts (or so the introduction claims). Apart from some dialogue changes, the scripts are virtually identical to the final films. Witty and interesting to screenwriters everywhere but could have had some more input from the two writers. Its a pity that more of their work isn't more widely available."
4,good book,the book came in ok quality and would be perfect anyone who enjoys football and is learning or practicing reading!!
1,One of the worst stories I've ever read...,"I read this story to my six-year old tonight. While reading it, I confess I couldn't wait for it to end. It has no semblance of a plot. First a bunch of animals see a ball. Then there's a kids football game. Then it's back to the animals, and we never see what happened with the game. The story meanders from one pointless development to the other until blissfully, thankfully the story ends -- at least that was my opinion. When I finished reading it my six-year old turned to me and said it was the worst story he'd ever heard. What could I do? I told him he was right, and apologized for picking it as his bedtime book. My advice is kick this book away, pass on buying it and run as fast as you can to a more interesting read, like maybe a life insurance brochure, a microwave instruction manual or a piece of tree bark with interesting patterns on it -- anything really, but this."
3,good,"The Scuttlebug fits my daughter well in both size and developmentally, but after playing with it for the first week, she seems to have totally lost interest. She's 2 years old. Maybe she'll pick up an interest in it again at some later time."
2,Too small,"I was sooo happy to see this toy and soo disapointed when my 24 month old, 25 pound 32 inch tall granddaughter was MUCH too tall for a toy that according to the manufaturing company goes to age three. This toy would be all but PERFECT if it could be hight adjusted in the seat and the handle bars - it seems to me that should be a minor adjustment and if and when RAZOR does this I am sure the toy will be jumping off the shelves faster than they can produce them. I am waiting."
4,It's a great trike if you get a good price,"I saw this 6 mos ago and read the reviews and decided not to buy it, since my son is taller than average. I just found it at Walmart on clearance (about 66% off the amazon price) and decided to buy it. He loves playing on it. The advantage of the short height is that the center of gravity is lower and it doesn't tip so easily. It's light and he picks it up to move it around if he wants. Though I wouldn't recommend this product at full price, it is worthwhile if you can find a deal."
3,Handle Bars don't adjust!,"I just bought this for my son today. I thought that since it said for 19months to 3 year olds it would be somewhat adjustable. The buying info said that the handle bars were adjustable. There is nothing in the directions about this and I can't figure out how that would be possible considering all the fastners are permanant. So far, he seems to really like it but his heels keep hitting the back wheels and our son is on the shorter side. I'm not sure how a taller child would do. I thought this would be more like a first trike but it's really just like a toddler's riding toy (Of which we already have 2, didn't need a 3rd). Instead, I would have gone for the real deal tricycle. I haven't decided if we will keep this toy or not."
2,I wish it were adjustable,"I just saw this toy in Parents Magazine Sunday night and was so excited to see it on sale at Target this week. I ran to get it since my [...] son is too short to use his hand-me-down red tricycle. It looked like lots of fun in the picture, however, my son is too big for it! I don't know why it states that it is suitable for up to 3 years old- no way! If it were adjustable, I'm sure he would have loved it, but just like another reviewer stated- it's just like the other ride-on toys we already own. Currently, the Scuttle Bug is in the trunk ready to be returned to the store. How disappointing."
5,My son loves this. Been riding it since he was 1.,"My almost 4 year old son 38 lbs(maybe more) 41"" inch still enjoys his scuttle bug, (He calls it his BE BE) He may look cramped on it, but loves riding it. Dont let the size scare you away from it. Kids will enjoy it. And its very durable."
4,would recommend scuttle bug,My son got this a few months ago when he was 18 months old and has used it every day ever since!! The only problem I experienced with it was when we first got it one of the back tires wasnt put on properly and it fell off while he was riding it. I had to personally secure it back on. NO issues ever since. Its really compact and is great for indoor use as well as out!I would definately recommend this toy!!
3,Beautiful Photo's - But Just too small,"This cloth bound book displays some of Beken's best work, the only reason I give it three stars is that it is just too small. The beautiful sepia colours of his art and majestic sailing ships of the bygone era are not done justice by the tiny reproductions in this work, considering its' cost.At 8"" x 5"" it is almost too small to be a coffee table book.Anyway, the book displays the famous yachts of the era from the 1880's to pre-WWII with small dialogs before each chapter to explain the stage and history of sailing at Cowes in each era, from the turn of the century (1800-1900), pre-WWI, Post WWI, pre WWII. It gives little history of the photographer, and his methods.If you own any Bekken prints, it will hold a little interest to you, but you will be disappointed in a album that could have been done so much better."
3,It's alright,It is better this time that I ordered the firm mattress because it does not sink down as much as the semifirm mattress. Other that that it is comfortable.
1,Worst Ever,"DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!!! I ordered the king version and it is horrible. I want my money back!!!! This was delivered in three boxes and was bound by plastic wrap. Once out of the box, the three layers were cut with what looked like pinking shears and were horribly uneven. This was NEVER a mattress that sold for 1259.00 ... When I tried to return it All Sleep was helpful at first but I could not package the layers to send. While trying to come up with a solution to the shipping problem, the UPS labels they sent to me expired and now they will not return any emails or calls. They are not a member of the BBB in MA, so foget trying to report them.WORST SERVICE AND PRODUCT EVER!"
3,Pretty but not highest quality,This was a pretty watch however when I opened the package one of the pins that hold the bracket together was almost popped out.
3,A little disappointed,"After I purchased the incredible and wonderful ""The Very Best OfJack Scott"" I expected something similar with this twofer but theresult was a little disappointing. A lot of artists have paid tributeto the great Hank Williams, being Roy Orbison's the absolute best offerever, but I found this one the weakest contribution. Just for absoluteJack Scott fans only."
4,a bit dissapointed,"i had this same cologne a couple years ago. It was the same bottle as the picture so i was very excited to buy it because i havent seen it in so long ans the smell will get the girls all over you but when i received it, it was not the bottle in the picture. it was about 2 times smaller not happy with that. but the smell is awesome"
4,Great tool,"This book gives lots of highly recommendable drills that will help you in your practices, at all levels. Fundamentals are covered very well and lots of set plays are well explained too."
3,Review the Review,"I bought this book so that I could brush up on my math skills before taking the basic skills test for the MTTC. However, while taking the practice test in the math section I found three mistakes, and there may be more. They either gave me the wrong answer, doubled an answer, or completely contradicted themselves in the explanation. Although the majority of the questions were helpful, it made me lose a little faith in the book."
3,Just good enough...,"The book does give a good overview of questions asked in the MTTC Basic Skills Test (the only section I used) but more than one of the answers given in the practice test section for math was wrong--a serious flaw in a test prep book, I think."
3,Needs more editing,"Needs more editing, not the most correct in the info given. Can make you second guess yourself on given answers. If you JUST need a refresher, than this is the book for you."
4,Simply pilates,"I love this DVD for home exercises but with a lot of these things I wouldn't like to try it not having done classes in the past. It's absolutely great for continuing exercises but I'd get a teacher to explain everything clearly in a class first.I like jennifer's firm but clear tone, the speed and the grace.Great for home use - but do some classes first!"
2,"Through instructions for beginners, not a good workout video",I received this as a gift. I have been doing Pilates for several years on an off. This DVD would have been great in the beginning before I did any other DVDs or classes. The instructor is very through in each step. But it would be nice to go deeper into more advanced pilates moves. This is an instruction manual for some basic moves not a workout video.
1,Expected History and Got A Movie Review,"I would give this book no stars if possible. It was utter crap. It was essentially a who's-who among the Popes of liberal Catholicism. From calling Pius X an intemperate, mean-spirited tyrant that set the Church back ""for half a century"" to calling John XXIII the most beloved Pope in history, and his pontificate of the greatest importance since that of St. Peter himself. I have to question the scholarship of any ""Catholic"" author impugning the only canonized Holy Father of the last century while glorifying the one that called the only unnecessary Council in history and almost single-handedly tried to tear the Latin Church down brick by brick, but I suppose I should expect nothing less from the Theology Department of Notre Dame.St. Pius X, ora pro nobis"
4,Ford's Follow Up,"After the success of THE IRON HORSE, Fox wanted anothe epic from Ford, so they gave him 3 BAD MEN. It didn't succeed at the box office, and the director didn't make another Western until 13 years later with STAGOCOACH. Despite its monetary failure, 3 BAD MEN is a compelling film, and *not* a companion film to Ford's later 3 GODFATHERS. They are based on differing books, set in differing locations, and in this film, they rescue a young woman instead of an infant. Ford *did* make 3 GODFATHERS as a silent, calling it MARKED MEN. This film shows us people are capable of change, and the photography is stunning. 3 BAD MEN is discussed in more detail in my recent book 'Head `Em Off At the Pass! 94 Westers You Should Watch.'Head `Em Off At the Pass!: 94 Westerns You Should WatchHANGMAN'S HOUSE is sadly remembered for a bit part of John Wayne's and people seem to forget McLaglen's wonderful performance. Pity."
5,What else is there?,"This is The Book for The Place. No one is more thorough than Stanley Welsh, and there are perhaps six people who know the diverse, Utah flora as well or nearly as well. Welsh is a ""splitter,"" but I recall Askell 'Love saying, ""If you are not sure, split and let others review your observation."""
1,A big disappointment,"When there is such a dearth of materials for the learning of Twi, I am reluctant to criticise. However, a dictionary is a critical resource for a learner and should be reliable and educative. This dictionary is inaccurate and incomplete. I am working with two of the most widely used series of Twi learner's books available in Ghana, and a significant proportion of their vocabulary is missing from this dictionary, spelt differently from accepted usage, or given inaccurate meanings. Unfortunately, we still await a good modern Twi dictionary by a native speaker of the language."
1,"Note: this is Akuapem Twi, NOT Asante Twi","WARNING! The most common Twi language that is spoken is NOT Akuapem Twi, which is the type of Twi that this dictionary is for. So if you want to learn Twi, chances are that you want to learn Asante Twi. So this is probably not what most of you are looking for."
1,Disappointed Americani married to a Ghanani,"I read the reviews and found a used copy at a good price and thought I would try it since there aren't many options for Twi dictionaries. I sat down with my wife who speaks fluent Twi and started reading words to her just for fun. We both became frustrated in that she only understood a handful of the words. I do understand that there are many dialects of Twi but I would ask her how to pronounce certain words and they weren't even close to the spellings in the book. In his acknowledgement, Mr. Kotey States that the dictionary is a by product of a research grant to create instructional materials for three Akan languages. He goes on to list many prominant Ghanaian collaborators but at the bottom of this extensive list he states that, ""None of them however, participated in this dictionary project."" If Mr. Kotey decides to re-write this in a more concise version, there is definately a need and a market for it. But next time, please run it by your collaborators."
2,Much smaller than it appears on the website,"This bag was really small, much smaller than it appears. You would be hard pressed to fit more than a sweater, magazine, small digital camera and a bottle of water. I needed it for traveling with children so ended up returning it. If you're a light traveler, it may work for you."
2,Few good forms in otherwise poorly organized book,"The most important note to make about this book is that it is only a book of forms. There are no essays or articles in it that will help you learn about coaching.Some of the forms might be useful to someone who is starting up a new coaching practice. The main thing I noticed about the forms is that they are repetitive. There are multiple intake forms, multiple coaching FAQ forms, multiple ""First Coaching Session"" forms, etc... Each with basically the same information. The worst thing about the book is that the forms are not well organized.There are definitely better books out there to introduce you to coaching.One Better Recommendation:There is one book in my current library that came with a CD-ROM filled with forms you can edit and then print or send in email to your clients. The book itself was also a great intro to coaching: Fabjob guide to Becoming a Life Coach."
3,Almost an exact copy of another book,I ordered this book along with Essential Coaching Tools. They are almost exact duplicates. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED. There are some differences so I will keep both to use in my future practice.
4,Simple steps to coaching,This book is easy to read and is laid out in easy steps to follow to begin a life coaching practice.
4,Works well...,"I bought this item so I could listen to my ipod while I worked from home. It works very well for what I need. I like the features it has including am/fm radio, clock, alarm, and remote. The one drawback I can see so far is that the directions are very difficult to understand. It is pretty self-explanatory except for things like turning the alarm on the clock on and off. It took me a good half hour to figure out how to do that. Otherwise it works great."
1,Don't buy this,Don't buy one of these. The first time I used it I noticed bristles on the eggplant slices I was basting. Then when I cleaned it all the bristles pulled right out.
5,One of The Best!!!,"This is an essential metal album!! I got it back in '89 and still rock it today! EVERY song on this rulz! Especially ""Bones In The Gutter""!Buy it!!!!"
1,What?,Ummm.....Sportin' a Woody is the greatest love song ever written. I plan on playing it at my wedding. I'm glad these guys are dead!
4,A great band a great album ready to blow your mind.,"...Well when I first started listening to glam I was into the regular stuff like Bon Jovi and deff leppard.But then I heard this album and i came to know that this is just a nother cool album and a cool rock band.Well songs like ""sacred"", ""Bones in the gutter"", ""take me druk"" are my all time favourite.So if you are into glam then this is the coolest album that you can lay your hands on."
3,its alright,"the album is alright... Their is a reason Dangerous Toys weren't as huge as other 80's metal bands, and its simple, their songs weren't great.A fun listen for fans of late 80's/early 90's hard rock fans."
4,"Full of classic hits, like ""Sport'n A Woody""","I think they won a grammy for that track.Just fun rock 'n roll, enough said."
5,Thid is a RARE find!,"If you can ignore the poor sound quality of 1939, this is a great, rare live recording of the great band led by one of the great drummers of the day - Chick Webb! One of the early swing pioneers and king of the Savoy Ballroom for many years, these recordings let us have a breif hearing of his band in live performance to prove he swung even greater live than on the studio 78's. This CD is from 1939, less than 2 months before his death in June, 1939, but he still drove the band relentlessly. An added bonus is hearing a young Ella Fitzgerald in the infantcy of her fabulous career. Hearing this CD, even to the unassociated listner, will make your feet tap and give you a breif glimpse into the great world of swing bands."
5,can't get enough!,I had my friend watch one episode once on a Saturday morning and now she is hooked. She has TIVO-ed to find the episodes. She is very sad that she can not find them. She wanted to see the episodes from the 1st season. So...for her 40th birthday...yes 40th! I want to get her a compilation of all the episodes. When will it be available?
4,refreshing.,"i collect all the songs by cursive i can, but i just got this one, because i figured it just had songs from the ugly organ. new to me are the songs once and adapt. as a standalone, this is pretty solid for 3 songs. it shows a lot of kasher's emotion, and i'd also reccomend it to anybody who cursive is getting a little one-dimensional to. the recluse has a feel that more or less sums up the feeling of the ugly organ. once is probably the best song on here...it's almost like cursive mixed with some system of a down-ishness, which works so well because they're both so technical. adapt is pretty much the standard, feeling evoking, albeit high-quality cursive song, with this alluring super mario brothers-ish sound for the finale that really fits well.this'd make a great companion to the ugly organ, if you got it cheap."
5,Remarkable documentary,"The most astonishing documentry recorded by Hollywood. Without this, a part of human history would be lost. A most see piece of art."
5,The most amazing film I've ever seen,"This 1925 silent film documentary is not for everybody. The first half is irrelevant and slow, and the commentary is hokey. I was surprised there were no dramatic Hollywood scenes of people falling off cliffs. But what I got instead was a historical record of 50,000 people and 500,000 animals walking for 48 days across Persia to avoid famine. It's hard to believe that these are real people, genuinely swimming for their lives, crossing a half-mile of freezing rapids holding on to blown up goat skins. We are so used to seeing things staged, that it's hard to accept that they really are climbing that 12,000 foot mountain in their bare feet, to get a better grip in the ice and snow."
3,GREAT VINTAGE DOCUMENTARY BY KING KONG'S CREATORS,"In the early 1920s, the creators of King Kong, Merian C. Cooper and his partner Ernest B. Schoedseck, were fledgling filmmakers when they shot GRASS: A NATION'S BATTLE FOR LIFE.In dramatic black and white, silent, with music score added later, this account of the Persian (now Iran) Bakhtiarian tribe's annual migration is as gripping as the like-minded People of the Wind (also available on DVD).This great companion piece to the later and similar film reveals how minimal the changes -- besides fewer numbers, only 50,000 persons -- in the routines over the intervening 50 years between the films.I like this film's artistry (Shoedsack's photography) and the bold theatrical sense of Cooper's direction. It's the same journey but with different people and from a more primitive and perhaps more daring perspective.Unrated. Genre: Adventure documentary. 1 hour, 21 minutes. Director: Merian C. Cooper, Ernest B. Shoedsack and Marguerite Harrison."
4,An incredible human feat caught on film.,"I saw this film in a class at Oakland University. I could not believe what I was watching human beings (and livestock)doing! These fairly primitive nomads every year must cross a seemingly impassable mountain range to ensure their survival. Very worth watching, and future teachers like me will find it useful as well."
2,Are You Afraid Of The Dark? Freaky Favorites DVD,"If you are a fan of the old school NickAtNight show, this is not the same! If you are new into the show, this would be an introduction but nothing beats the beginning seasons of the show!"
5,PLEASE PUT IT ON DVD!,"This was the best show ever!!!!!!! i wish they put it on dvd because i will be so sad if they didnt, this show is one of the best of the 90's"
1,horrible,"this takes the bad episodes out of the last 2 seasons of ""are u afraid of the dark"" and label it as freaky favorites. they are not freaky and not my favorites. NOT RECOMMENDED"
4,A Little Disapointed,When I bought This I Was A Little Disapointed That It Was Not The Original Cast But Instead It Was ^ Selections From Season 6 Long After The Original Show Died But This Is Still Really Cool Because I Watched The Entire Show From Start To Finish And It Is A Great Trip Down MemorySo I Would Still Recomend This To Any Viewer That Watched Any Part Of The Show [[..]]
5,CDNOW PLEASE HELP US.......,"PLEASE put this on dvd. ""ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK?"", is one of the best shows that NICKELODEON ever made. I will forever be greatfull if you could please float this to NICKELODEON'S website or something. PLEASE!!!!!!! You guys are our only hope. So please help our SNICK fans bring back the 90's. I have a feeling you will be glad if you would. Thank. "" THIS IS REFERING TO "" ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK?"", ON NICKELODEON. I WOULD GIVE THIS SHOW 1,000 STARS IF THEY HAD THEM."
1,I want the real seasons 1 through whaterever Please,I loved this sereies so much as a kid. Why can't they release real seasons? I liked it alot because it was scary but wasn't to scary. I really hope that I get the real ones on dvd.
5,An awsome show that has to be put on dvd soon :),"I Loved this show this was a good clean fun show. If this is the show on nickelodeon. I also miss Hey Dude, Space Cases, Alex Max, Salute your shorts. They are the best ones in my book. I just want to keep the memories on the dvd format for other generations to watch. I used to watch the line up. They also have such unique characters. All of them are good actors. Please also put Salute your shorts, and Hey Dude too. Also Alex Max. Snick fans would love all of those shows on dvd format. I would buy them. I would give them all 21 stars if cd now had that many stars. This is refering to "" Are you Afraid of the Dark?"" Series on Nickelodeon. I just hope this is the right show title. Anyway, please concider putting ""Are you Afraid of the Dark?"" and the other shows that i had mentioned on dvd. Thaks a lot!!!!!!! Hey, just think about it please?! Thanks!"
3,fair,"this abulm is good baering in mind he was once just a boy who sings ,his music is good and i enjoy his album it is worth the money"
5,"Lifesaver, Life Extender, Miracle","We wish we had this in 2005 when our 16 year old kitty Cleo passed away from CRF. When her sister Shorty was diagnosed in Oct. 2005, we were told she might have a month or might have a year. Well, she made it to age 19 1/2 in Sept. 2008 (3 years later!) and we're sure that Epakitin is the reason. We added the Azodyl last year when we became aware of it, so that may have helped too. We mixed both in with grain-free Wellness brand food to reduce phosphorus and toxin buildup. And NO dry food, big no-no! Good luck, and bless your sweet pootie or woozle."
5,Good product,I use this for my cat with renal failure it helps him out quite a bit.I use twice daily in his canned food or on dry food.Recommended by my veterinarian.
1,Never again with vana,"I will never purchase from vana11 again and I recommend you don't either. Wrong item was received, regardless of who's error it was- they should take the book back since I paid for shipping both ways. They were IMPOSSIBLE and rude to deal with and would only give me 80% of my money back. There was no photo for this book listing and they sent me a 18 year old version. I contacted them immediately upon receiving the book and still only an 80% refund after some very rude comments."
1,i agree,"I agree with Werner's review; I have not bought this volume, nor will I buy it. Werner, see my review of the 185.00 encyclopedia which I inadvertantly ordered only to return it the next day. These authors overcharge for the simple fact that uneducated readers are willing to pay these exorbitant prices; the books are usually disguised as ""specialty"" subjects that require alot of research. I say B.S.--most such work is either copied or rehashed from the same few sources. Buyer beware."
3,"some recipes were good, others were OK","well i got this book because i liked the way it was organized but i have a couple of complaints. 1. the author has changed the names of some of the recipes. the true indian name of the recipe is not the same as the one stated in the book, which to me just killed the authencity. 2. some recipes were not that good (at all) while most of them turned out great. so i just don't understand what happened. i followed the directions exactly as said in the book, and being indian i kinda of understood what it was supposed to look like, but maybe i did go wrong somewhere.however, the book is well organized...he makes cooking indian food easy. i just wish he had more recipes and that ALL of them were good. generally though, my husband pretty much liked what came out of this book."
1,poor,"This book tries to simplify Indian cooking, but it gets confusing with all the bowls and mixtures. I prefer traditional recipes."
4,Shaakir - A Star On The Rise,"This brother is smooth. His love for the music is felt throughout the CD. Shaakir's style is like no other. For those who smooth sax playing with great bass grooves, or music to chill with that special someone, then this is a MUST HAVE. I especially like the cut ""For Old Times Sake Part 2."" I recently had the privilege to meet Shaakir a few weeks ago. The guy is real and so is his music. This is the second of five CD's he has recorded. This guy is going places. Check this CD out. Don't sleep on this one. You'll regret it. Look out for his next CD to hit in 2004. It's the bomb!!"
2,disappointed,I found the quality of her voice has deteriorated over time..she is not really able to hit the high notes and frequently changes the notes to lower ones in some songs. She is occasionally flat on some notes. While the selection of music is good I would recommend getting earlier editions of her work.
5,Worked as expected,It arrived quickly and was easy to connect to my garage door system. There's not much more one can say about a replacement garage door opener.
3,"It is an unelegant, functional device","The device functions fine. The range is good. They advertised a 5 year battery life, which I can't confirm yet. As for anything else that is special about it-- not much. It is a square black box with a gray button, obviously not designed by Apple or anyone with an industrial design background. If you carry it into a bar, you are not going to get envious looks or phone numbers from hot Cougars. There are no indicator lights on it. No beeps. No bells. No whistles. But then again, it is just a garage door opener."
4,971M,Item arrived on time and worked as it was suppose to. all is in working order. Blah waw cwah ha.
3,Double check Model Number,"My Craftsman garage door opener had what appeared to be an orangish/yellow program button so I bought 2 of these remotes thinking they were the correct ones. They did not work with my opener. The model number on the garage door opener didn't match with anything else I'd seen online. Upon a lucky internet search I came across this website and was able to find the correct opener, I needed the 'dip-switch' model 61LM. I hope this helps someone else.[...]"
5,Easy to install,"The item was delivered new,and only required you to press2 buttons to be programed,one on the garage door openerand one on the remote."
5,Great product for the price,"Works perfectly, excepts garage opens randomly by itself. Requires to push lock button at wall switch at night. This fixed the issue with my opener."
4,Very simple,"I needed an extra opener for my work vehicle, got it in just a few days, easy to program, works great."
1,2 out of 3 were defective,"2 out of 3 remotes that we ordered never worked. Even after changing the batteries, nothing, these were were as dead as a stone. The third one works fine, if you call that luck...."
5,On Time and Works,I needed a garage door opener in this one was the best one I can find around. List Master works very well and also the shipping was very fast. I would recommend this to you for a inexpensive and good working garage door opener.
5,Easy to program and it works!!,"My son lost the original overheard remote, so I ordered this one for replacement. it was easy to program and it works!"
4,door opener,bought the wrong opener's returned them received a credit the new one'as worked great.easy to program done in second's.i give them 5star's
5,Thank You,Item received and programed. Worked as advertised. Very much appreciated as it was below $17 to replace my lost garage door opener... Thank you!!!
5,971LM STOP HERE!!!!!!!,"If you are looking for 971LM garage door opener for Liftmaster with the red / orange reset button. ORDER it here. Ordered sunday night and was delivered thursday in the mail to Dallas Tx. Under 18.00 delived to my door, the big hardware chain stores wanted nearly 35.00 for a universal unit. Buy two and keep a spare, I did. Battery and instructions included, in less than five minutes we were a happy two remote family again."
1,It didn't work for me,"Hi,I got this remote after reading all the reviews. My garage door has a orange light and this door opener was meant to work for orange learn button but unfortunately it didn't sync. I am returning this product now.thanks,"
1,Does not work for older craftsman model :(,I have an older garage door and this item does not work on it. Bummer!
1,"""LEARN BUTTON""","The first thing on the instruction sheet is ""your garage door must have a learn button"" I really wish that the description would have included this information before I made my purchase. I tried calling customer service to try to either exchange or help with a resolution but have not been fortunate enough to speak with an actual person. The ""hold"" music is lovely and I always enjoy listening to that! I am sure this garage door remote is fantastic- it just won't work on my existing garage door opener."
1,Wrong model,"Puchased this remote to work with my older Liftmaster unit. It did not work. This remote only works with a ""learning"" system motor. Shame on me for not researching deeper, but the product description is not clear. Because of the restocking and shipping, I'll eat my mistake. Buyer beware. Check the exact model of your motor."
5,So easy to program!,"After pricing similar remotes in our local stores and finding prices to be at least 40 dollars, decided to check out amazon prices. So happy to find prices much more reasonable so I ordered. Couldn't be easier to program literally took me 3 minutes. Would highly recommend this product!"
5,works great,"I like this product. I was everything i expected it to be, and i would recommend it for anyone looking for something like this"
5,"Great price, works great too!","We bought a house and only got 1 door opener. I ordered a second for my husband that so kindly let me have the 1 opener. It came in today, faster then expects and took 3 minutes to get it working. It was a fraction of the cost direct from the company or Home Depot! Thinking of getting a third as a back up!"
2,Return policy is the horrible.,If you want to return for exchange then rather buy an new one. Please look at policy return.
5,"As advertised, just faster than expected","Product arrived before the expected date, was brand new and packaged carefully. This company is excellent."
5,Perfect,The Liftmaster 971LM opener worked perfectly right out of the box. I will probably order another.
