2,His vocals are nothing to write home about,"Tim Barry is a pissed off southern rocker with a chip on his shoulder and an acoustic guitar in his hands. His vocals are nothing to write home about, but you can't deny that his words of pain and hatred are born from his heart and experiences. He backs up his statements with strong and angry emotions. If you're in a bad mood you'll probably make a connect, but if things are alright in your world, Barry may just bring you down."
1,Absolutely terrible book,"I bought this book only because I need to try to support the Kodak FlashPix format, and this book happened to have some code related to that format. Unfortunately for me, the code doesn't work. It constantly returns errors and cannot even open the FlashPix pictures that came with the book on the CD. This is the second (and last) worthless computer book I've bought from Wordware. I contacted then to see if maybe there had been an update to fix the bad code on the CD, and they told me they don't support the code contained in their books and that I would have to contact the author.One star is the lowest rating Amazon has, so that's what I entered... but it deserves no stars and a whole mess of lemons because that's what this book is."
1,Do yourself a favor and stay away from this book!,"Do yourself a favor and stay away from this book! This has got to be one of the worst programming books I have ever seen.The code included on the CD doesn't match that in the book, and neither set of code work. The included examples crash, have missing files, and various other problems. The author includes his e-mail address but ignores all questions, so support is non-existant. There is not one redeeming quality of this book."
1,Save your hard ( or easy) earned money,"I picked up this book in the Bargain book bin for $4.99 and paid five times its value. The book is poorly written, filled with errors and the CD ROM would make a good coaster. I gave this book 1 star but a 1/2 star is more appropriate."
3,Half of this double is ok,"After having plunked down 20 bucks for this dvd, I have to say that I am disappointed with part of it. The first feature is one of the most bizarre I have ever seen. Two guys kidnap three women and scare them before having sex with them. A very odd and unusual concept. I liked the third girl a lot, she is very attractive, but cannot act worth beans. This feature called Scare Their Pants Off was ok. The second feature Satan's Bed is simply awful. The acting sucks, the dialog is wretched and Yoko Ono adds nothing but freak value to an already awful freak show. All I could make out was that two guys and a woman go on a crime spree attacking woman and raping them. If you like this kind of stuff then this is for you, but I felt cheated."
3,scare their pants off/ Satan's bed,I all ways ordered movies from S.W.V. you can watch a movie and laugh at the same time. for this title I didn't see any thing that wound make me want to watch.
3,"Good, but do not recommend","A certain type of hardy boys series are very good, but not this one. The story is too formal that it cannot make any interests from this story. You can only read some typical stoies of old detective stories, but the detective story maniac can read this for entertaining."
2,Bloatware keeps it from working in VISTA!!,"Others had a problem with the retracting mechanism... I've used mine a lot, and lent it to ppl and haven't had a problem. Others find the gravity blade retraction mechanism unique (read downright kewl) and the metal flap over the business end is unique.I don't like the extraneous junk the drive came with. In fact I had to uninstall the U3 utility (in XP) before it would work on my 2 vista machines. -They claim newer U3 versions work with Vista, but what a waste of time. Reformatting with NTFS wasn't enough. Gave the stick a bad review because of bloatware."
1,Poorly Built and poor Sandisk customer Service,"I bought this item from Amazon (which by the way is my favorate pplace to shop) on october 16, and just one week later, it stopped sliding. It looked like something went underneath and jammed it. I tried everything but nothing worked. I needed to access my stuff on it, so I took it apart so that I can retrieve my items.I contacted Sandisk and explained the situation, they said it was misuse and not covered by warranty. There was no way I was going to send it back to them without retrieving the stuff on it.So my take on it, if you buy it, dont use it for anything important, because if it jams, you have to break it open. and Sandisk wont cover you."
2,Great drive.. HORRIBLE design!,"I carry a lot of these drives around because I am constantly on the go and I run several businesses. I have another SanDisk that slides the usb key which works perfectly and is very easy to use. I don't know if I got a bum key but this one STINKS! The problem is every time I go to insert it into the usb port it pushes the darn thing back into its case! I can spend 10 minutes trying to get it just right so it finally inserts. My wife got a great deal on the drive and was so excited so I don't have the heart to tell her its flawed. I should soon though because I see they do have a 4gb in the other model. This design is pointless to me because the other one works just as well and isn't that fancy.Bottom line, SanDisk makes quality stuff but this design is not worth it."
3,failed after a year,"The drive is fast.A little clumsy, blocks the nearby USB port, but it's OK.It failed after 14 months. Disappointed."
4,Vista users READ THIS!,"This flash drive has worked very well for me so far (i got it today), at first its hard to open, but once u get used t oit its fine. some things i like about it:It looks GREAT! has a nice capcity, but the U3 and readyboost doesnt work with vista, wat i did was delete EVERYTHING on the drive when u FIRST get it. then i re-formatted it with the default Fat32 type. and it works fine now! i only rated four starz u=instead if five because of the hassle to do this all. :) but overall VERY good flash drive! by it! =]"
3,"Agree, but....","I've read most of the other reviews and generally agree with their opinions, but...I attended several GL concerts during the '70's. Also, I learned and refined my guitar fingerpicking style ala GL from his earlier days.It's one thing to watch an aging ""Legend"" perform who occasionally can't hit or hold certain notes when singing. It's quite another thing to watch an artist and Legend we love and admired perform at a much reduced state due to illness. Frankly, it was difficult for me to watch this concert. Hang in their ""G""."
3,There is a live 1972 Lightfoot concert on sale at Amazon UK!,"If you want to see and hear Gordon in his prime, Amazon UK is selling a DVD titled ""Talking In Your Sleep"" which was recorded by the BBC in 1972. I love Gordon Lightfoot but he was past his peak when the Live in Reno DVD was recorded, hence I can only give it 3 stars. The BBC 1972 concert is 100% better and is described as ""All regions"" so it should play on US equipment."
3,The star is super.The dvd is not,Perhaps I just got a bad one but it is a shame that this dvd does not do Mr.Lightfoot the justice that he so richly deserves.I found both the picture quality and the sound quality left a lot to be desired.As a matter of fact I own a fair number of concerts on dvd and the difference in quality is astounding.
5,Gordon Lightfoot Live!,"Great DVD. This is an absolute ""must"" for the Gordon Lightfoot fan! Gordon looks great en sings even better. I think Gordon is a very friendly person. I`m very pleased with this video, because I didn't have the chance to see Gordon live. It's a shame that Gordon doesn't come to Europe for a concert. I live in the Netherlands (that small country in Europe with the capital Amsterdam). For the fans in Europe: buy the US-version of this DVD it contains 22 songs in stead of the 14 songs on the European version. But if you do so, don't forget to buy a region-free DVD-player!"
5,Good Show For Lightfoot Fans,"I saw Gordon Lightfoot live in 1987 and enjoyed the show, very much. I was hoping that this video would allow me to re-live some of that enjoyment and was not disappointed. As noted in other reviews, Mr. Lightfoot could use a few more healthy meals, but he sings well and his guitar playing is impecable. This is not a flashy Las Vegas stage show, just he and his band on stage, and it seems like he has to remind himself to look into the camera, once in a while, rather than just at the audience. Overall, the picture is clear and the sound is good. I like it."
3,Not the best,"A true legend and great singer/songwriter. Unfortunately, due to his previous illness and him getting on in years, Gordon Lightfoot is not at his best in this concert, which is a real shame. Many times while watching I thought to myself ""I need subtitles"" as I could not understand him. Gordon - you did one too many concerts. Nevertheless, you are still a legend."
3,Mediocre Performance,This concert is mediocre at best. Gordon's voice in many of the songs does not really bring out the best in him. I was somewhat disappointed in this production.
1,Not worth the money,"I ordered this item from Amazon and got it in due time. I tried to download it to my computer, which has all the programs necessary to do such a task. It will not play or download to the computer. I tried playing it on my regular entertainment system, which is also equiped to play these DVDs. It will not load and play. I don't know what I need to do to make this DVD play but I'm quite tired of trying...sending it back."
4,"nice and clean,good choice of songs",I think this is a good cd by the 'Hawks. It has a good variety of styles and some rocking songs. I have followed them for 20 years and this is one of their best studio recordings
2,pass on this & get 10 years live,"i'm an avid nighthawks fan and have everything they've done. i'm disappointed in this cd. if you want to hear ""guard my heart"" buy ten years live. if you want to hear ""that's the way love is"" buy a marvin gaye cd. i was never a big fan of the song ""washed my hands"" and after hearing this version, i'm still not... ""nobody but you"" and ""slow dance"" has some good harp, my two favorites. the rest are just so so, nothing really jumped out at me, if you know what i mean."
3,"Good music, lousy CD","I love this album, and yes, I have the vinyl version too (one of my rare duplicates). I won't repeat what the others have said, except to say that this is some of Santana's best music, done at his peak. Unfortunately, the recording quality isn't the best, and the trnasfer to CD is pretty bad. Parts are fuzzy that aren't fuzzy on the LP. I'm not impressed."
3,It comes and it goes.,"This album shows what Mr. Santana does very well. Play the quitar. The problem is that it only works half the time. When it flows the riffs are great. The problem is that there are parts here, usually at the beginning of songs where the feedback and high pitchs sounds, just breaks the mood. It is usally very easy to get sucked into the sounds as the melody takes you places few others can. The problem it does not last."
1,Santana--Lotus Live,"This two-disc set could be condensed to a single disc and still have room left over if they removed the self-indulgent, seemingly endless transitions and other long, non-melodic stretches.What's great about Santana is his ability to speak melodically with his guitar; unfortunately, this CD just doesn't get the job done. Parts of it sound like he's practicing, not performing.If you like songs, try Moonflower or one of the early studio albums. Even true devotees would have to admit this set pretty far from melodic, although it has about three spots where it becomes recognizable (such as Black Magic Woman on disc one).And what's up with that long drum solo on disc 2? He's got several great people playing rhythm but instead we get a rather conventional, '60s-style drum solo.I love Moonflower; I just can't connect with Lotus."
5,For those who truly hear.....,"Turn out the lights.......turn the stereo up full volume....sit down.......and listen.......only for those who hear and understand......the best LIVE album ever recorded.....Santana, the band, at their brilliant best.......nothing comes close for heart, soul, and mind.....life changing"
4,The 3 record set sounds much better.,"I have owned the triple record set since it was first issued and to hear the clarity on vinyl is only for the die-hard record buff. The cd version is over produced, lacking the ""live"" feeling of the allbum. Can you hear the drum sticks hit the floor?"
5,Lotus is Awesome,"This is the best live Santana album available. It features live versions of many of their early songs, as well as some new instrumentals which are very awesome. Recomend to all Santana fans."
4,Dare yourself not to move,Passionate reminder of the wild-ride live act Santana once was in what must be one of their most explosive official classic live releases.
4,powerhouse playing,This live album has all the vitality it can handle.The way Santana roars on Every step of the way confirms that.The other cuts are well arranged using more of a brazilian rhythm leading up the beautiful Incident at Neshabur.
4,What Would Miles Think?,"He was around when the album was recorded, of course, but I have never read any comments he made about this explosive album. Santana pays homage to--or copies, depending on your want--some of the riffs from ""A Tribute to Jack Johnson"" by Davis, playing them note for note with the rest of the band in two. I suppose it's not ironic that Miles played some of the JJ stuff live in Japan for ""Agharta"" although oddly AFTER Santana recorded ""Lotus"" in the same country."
3,Good but not great vs. Canon w/ Image Stabilizer,"A good binocular. I found the 30x zoom to be almost unusable because of the shake. I have had these for a couple of years and really liked them.I recently bought the Canon 10x30 image stabilizer binoculars. I took both to a football game today. What a difference. The Canon, while it didn't zoom, gave a much brighter image. Obviously better optics. Not to mention that the stabilzer feature is amazing. After trying the Canon's in a direct compare and contrast, I can only give the Minoltas a 3. Again, a good binocular, but not in the same league as the Canon. The Canon, on the other hand, is double the price. You get what you pay for."
1,Don't wast your money on this one.,"This movie-first of all-is copied/pirated, it's very poor quality. It's very cloudy, not sharp-the images. Next, they jump from one thing to another, very poorly put together. I did not enjoyed at all."
1,This is not music!,"I am a music arts major at Cal Poly and I have never heard a CD this poor. Michael Jackson's overdubs over ""peaceful"" nature sounds is one of the most unrelaxing things I have ever experienced. Do not buy this. It's utter crap."
3,HUMMINBIRD XTM WIDE SIDE X-DUCER,"THE UNIT DOES GIVE SIDE & DOWN READINGS, AND ALL THE VIEW OPTIONS ON MY 728 FUNCTION. HOWEVER IT IS NOT A SIDE IMAGING UNIT !! THE INFORMATION IS SO COMPACTED & NEAR THE SURFACE ON THE SIDE INFO (EVEN IN THE 10FT.RANGE) THAT I CANNOT SEE ANY DETAILS. I BOUGHT IT TO LOOK AROUND BRUSH & STUMP COVER FOR CRAPPIE, AND AM REALLY DISAPOINTED!! I ALSO MISS THE TEMP READING WHICH I THOUGHT WAS INCLUDED, BUT IT ISN'T!"
2,mediocre,"great price, but it works like a year old original battery. It holds the charge for about one hour even though you're not using the camera. flash pictures kill it in about 30 minutes."
5,Yay!,"I love this cd, it's got that singalong quality to it. Incredibly childish, fun and yet powerful. I listen to it while eating raw coffee beans and I get hyper hyper hyper!!! It's like all those 80s pop smash songs played fast-fast-faster. Very coehsive mix from start to finish."
5,"""I can't stop raving...""","Oh my God, this disc rocks with the blow of Thor's Hammer. Never have I heard such brilliant rhythm, felt such unrivalled ecstasy, experienced such music enter my body, so that I must relent my body to the music. ""Hardcore Vibes"" careens to heights of angels' domain, a song truly dedicated to all the ravers in the nation."
1,So Sorry but...,"I hated this CD! The music on it is so overdone and trite. There are better worlds of Happycore out there, ya know. Happy 2b hardcore has better volumes. The BPM is not that high on this and it just doesnt strike me, srry."
5,Bee Gees,"As Described. They have crossed many age barriers. Popular everywhere they went. I have been building my music video collection for some time. I did not want this to get by. As a performing group, they will be missed."
3,Did not play well on my home PC,Did not play well on my computer where I always play many of my DVD videos(def not a PC problem) but I had no problems playing on my home sorround system.
3,Let the music play,"This BeeGee DVD was originally recorded for a live TV broadcast. The Bee Gees perform great, but the flow and the build up that you usually experience during a concert, is CONTSTANTLY interrupted by a presenter who tends to turn eveything into a commercial TV spot. Questions like ""what did you think when you had your first number one hit"" brilliantly answered by Robin ""Gee, our first number one hit"".... Daft questions, ennoying interruptions, superficial presenting and constantly complimenting the BeeGee's (the Bee Gees dont need that constant sort of kissing up from a presenter) ... The MUSIC itself is great although the songs are all kept very short. Please, let concerts be concerts and interviews be interviews."
4,Rewarding performances!,"Michael Ponti belongs possibly to the last dinasty of the most passionate Romantic school, as well as Earl Wild. He has played pitifully few works of Beethoven and his reading of the Sonata No 6 in F is very convincing. Technique, tune and temperament plus an eloquent approach will keep for you and curious surprise.I must confess I didn't like his approach about Chopin's Third Sonata. I find it empty of expression and lyrical ambition, cold and analytical.But when you listen his Liszt' Sonata In B Minor you will surprise with one of the most innovative and extraordinary performances in the market.I have my special preferences about this colossal work. I think Edith Farnadi in the fifties has not been yet surpassed, Clifford Curzon, Sviatoslav Richter and Michael Rudy make convincing and idiomatic readings but Ponti adds freshness, virility and rhytmic emphasis.Go for this CD and meet the art of this superb pianist."
1,JUNK,"I received this as a gift last year . . . . I read some online reviews that said it wasn't good . .and the reviews were right - - -This is a piece of junk . . . .after less than one year in service, I hear nothing but static now...and there seems to be no way to fix it...so I am tossing it out.....Buyer beware!!"
3,It's Not 13 A,"The power cord works just fine and seems to be of very good quality, however I have to give this a 3-star simply because the description says it is 13 A and it isn't -- it's 10A / 125 Volt."
4,In response to calliaume@aol.com,"To the contrary, the original Byrds albums definitely ARE worth owning--specifically the first six: ""Mr. Tambourine Man,"" ""Turn! Turn! Turn!,"" ""Fifth Dimension,"" ""Younger Than Yesterday,"" ""The Notorious Byrd Brothers"" and ""Sweetheart of the Rodeo."" All of the above titles have been reissued by Columbia/Legacy with great booklet essays, photos, etc.; best of all, a generous number of bonus tracks (some of them utterly brilliant) have been appended to each CD. Moreover, many of the group's most enduring numbers have been left off the box set: the Gene Clark classics ""Here Without You"" and ""Set You Free This Time""; their treatments of ""Wild Mountain Thyme"" and ""Satisfied Mind""; ""Change Is Now,"" etc. (Some of its inclusions are rather questionable too, specifically the later ones.) I highly recommended the original albums, especially in their expanded versions; they are essential listening."
4,belleza somnolienta que despierta en cada escucha,"sonido fresco, tintineantes guitarras y toda la ingenuidad y belleza d un grupo de canciones inolvidables, sobre todo reunidas en los tres discos..el ultimo decae un poco, empalideciendo la calidad total del box...pero bueno, no deja de ser una caja muy recomendable!"
2,psychedelic,"Low quality animation, but not so low that it deserves to be forgotten and never released to DVD. Gets off to a slow beginning, but many of the song numbers are refreshingly trippy."
5,Sweet Musical and Funny,My favorite songs and tender moments are in this film. Andy is the funniest Character in the movie. It was made in the 70's. But I saw it as though it were an 80's movie. My childhood favorite and probably yours too if you try it.
1,this movie is sooo gay.,"my little 3 year old sis loves this movie...there's a spooky song that gives me nightmares. i think it's called ""close to you."" (every other song is spooky.) Raggedyann's spooky too. haven't you ever noticed she never blinks?!..."
1,Scary!,"Hi. My mom loved this as a kid, so she thought I would like it, but I think it's scary, and gives me nightmares. Mostly because of that camel that needs to be in a mental hospital, and that pirate that has bouncy pants when he sings. ONLY give this to idiots!"
5,the best!,this movie was one of the only cartoons i can remember in detail!! i loved- and i hope to find a copy for my children!PLEASE RERELEASE IT!!
5,AMAZING!!!,"One of the most creative animated films ever made. Hard to get, but if you see it for sale, buy it!!! It's as good as either Toy Story and better than any animated movies out there now."
5,A New Generation deserves this enchanting musical!,"I loved watching this movie as a child and would love for my own children to share my memories of Babette, the Pirate King, the camel and Rageddy Ann and Andy among others. In this Disney dominated era it would be nice for my kids to have something ""new"" to watch."
5,Lost Classic,"This was an incredible piece of animation for its time. Very endearing, neat and memorable songs, and yes, pretty tripped out (it was made in the 70s, hello?). But it has The Camel With The Wrinkled Knees! What a sad, sad song he sang. Oh how I wish they'd re-release it on DVD. :("
3,Interesting for some folks,"This is an interesting CD, but better jazz is out there. Its interesting to anyone who wants to follow Kennedy's amazing talents. Its interesting to people who enjoy and explore violin jazz. Kennedy has a jazz style - maybe heavy on virtuosity and moderate on swinging and jazz idioms. I found Kennedy's blues tracks to be the most enjoyable. He has a strong sense of drama in the blues. The rest of the band is terrific. Kennedy chose well when assembling the band."
1,Ruined by poor engineering,"I checked this CD out from my local library. I'm a big Nigel Kennedy fan, but the engineering on this CD is just awful. The violin sounds very unnatural. The overall sound is quite lackluster. Unfortunate, because it gets in the way of a pretty good performance."
2,Ouch...,"First of all, it is way too expensive for what it is.Second of all, it isn't anything new or fresh.Third of all, musical quality isn't what I expect from the label.Compositions are dull and (maybe) sounding like some othertunes I know, sounds out of pitch and can't find any good groove.Could have sounded better without violin on it.Maybe next time..."
5,No general or admiral could write this book.,"Unsung Valor has so many favorable reviews that it needs no more. I agree with all of the good things already said about it, but I want to emphasize one point: EVERY TEENAGE AMERICAN SHOULD READ THIS BOOK. It catches for them the feeling of the time. It tells them about their grandfather's war. It shows how one young man managed to cope, and cope very well, with events beyond his control. This is a valuable lesson for any generation. With this book, Cleveland Harrison has performed a service that no general or admiral could. Read it for enjoyment. Give it to a young person for education."
4,"A comment on ""Unsung Valor","Havingwitnessed and treated the dead and dying as a Navy Corpsman in the Pacific area war I believe I qualify to comment on Harrison's revealing memoir. He turns a one time excursion in the Army's impersonal life into a full-length drama worth your time to read.As an expert rifleman,he moved when ordered,not aware of why or where. Living in stressful conditions with an enemy trying to kill him in combat,his mantra was ""Thy will be done"". The reader celebrates that God had a better plan than having Harrison die in a German mine field. How he learned lessons in combat,the Army Hospital in England and his assignment to military government should be required reading for high school and college students. The book is a tribute to those who earned our freedom. A.M.Stranz,R.Ph.,LL.B. a class mate."
5,UNSUNG VALOR--A diary of World War II,"Cleveland Harrison's book is a must-read for today's young men and women. He tells how World War II required 18-year-old boys, many of whom were college-bound, to change their plans and lose their innocence on the battlefields. They were forced into situations where they had to use their own instincts to survive. Harrison came through his experiences with discipline, dignity, and humor. He often entertained the troops with his acting talents and served with distinction in post-war Germany. This book is entertaining reading and also a well-deserved tribute to those who served in the armed forces during World War II."
5,The Human Side of War,"Cleveland Harrison has produced a wonderful memoir of his service in the US Army in World War II. What is so special about this account is the unassuming, unpretentious humanity of it. We get to learn a bit about his small-town life, his family, his enlistment, his military training, with many human details about himself and the men he served with. Only near the end of the book do we get a peek at actual combat situations and maybe this is a more realistic view of what many soldiers went through: long training and lots of waiting and boredom, followed by a sudden, quick, intense period of combat. Most striking to me were the author's reflections on how the war affected him many years later. Recommended highly."
5,Great story for Young,"Here's a World War II story that's perfect for young readers.It is the full story of a young fellow, between the ages of 18 and 21, being trained first for an engineer and then for an infantry rifleman. He describes what it was like being in combat on a quiet front in France and later in the Bulge in Germany. The one battle he fights in is harrowing and his company is almost wiped out. During the battle he steps on a land mine and is seriously injured. He tells all about being in the hospital before joining military government, where he's in the highest headquarters near Eisenhower and General Clay in Berlin. A kid of almost any age can read this book. His language and his adventures are clean."
5,"""Unsung Valor""",A facinating book as it depicts the real life of a young man caught up in world war II. The book has special meaning to me because it describes the life of a soldier and the events at Orscholz where Mr. Harrison saw combat and an uncle of mine was captured and subsequently died as a POW.
4,"If You Like Hot Tuna, You Will Like This Album",Why is it some people can't accept that artists move on? Thank God.Who wants to hear the same formula over and over. This album is not a radical departure from 70's era Hot Tuna. I like it also!
5,Photography for Conservation,"I really enjoyed this collection of still lives from the borderlines of space and time, light and structure.Art Wolfe captures precious fleeting moments in its photographs, and makes you see things as you never did before. He shows the inherent and often overlooked beauty of lifeless landscapes; human beings, animals, and nearly all plants are excluded. The books five materials, sand, water, rock, trees/cacti, ice - and I may add a sixth: skies - are portrayed with such mastery, that you can feel their texture, and experience all their colors and shapes.Art Davidson's texts are a perfect match, because they emphasize the photographer's statement that earth's integrity has to be conserved for the worth to humankind."
4,This is classic Shirlee Busbee...,"Although this book was not as exciting as her earlier works, I still enjoyed it because of the historical detail that is synonimous with Ms. Busbee's work. The caracters are fun but I thought that she could have gotten a little deeper into Chance's earlier years so we could get a better handle on the man he was in the story. Fancy was a fine lady but I expected a little more fire from her especially with Change and most definitly when she butted heads with Jonathan. I hope we don't have to wait too long for the next episode from Ms. Busbee's imagination. Thanks, Rita Hidi"
2,A little disappointed,"I was hoping for a documentary with some commentary, but it was just all music. YAWN!!!!! I do have to admit, however, that the scenery shots were excellent. I prefer documentaries with commentary so I know what I'm looking at. Yellowstone is such a dynamic place, close to my home, and I wanted a DVD that enhanced my experiences with it. This one just didn't do it."
4,A nice find,"I got into Rhythm Corps when they first came out when I was working in college radio. As luck would have it, they were scheduled to play at our Spring Fling (Ferrum College) and I got to see them live! It was a great show and since I was on the radio station staff, I got to hang with them after the show. I still have my autographed bass pick...Great memories."
3,Great for touchups and vacations....,This is great when you are in need of a touchup and cant get to a salon. I found the wax to not fully heat up and was a bit sticky.
3,Good sound but some design issues,"I'm an RN working CCU. I've had mine for a year. The sound is acceptable for general physical and lung/heart sounds assessment and the tubing is long enough for my needs. I can easily hear murmurs and bruits and faint lung sounds. But the stethoscope has some design issues. The heavy weight tubing is stiff and the connection between the diaphragm/bell is too loose for my liking. This combination causes the connection between the two to twist and lose it's ability to conduct any sound. I have to adjust my grip, angle, and sometimes ear pieces in order to get a good assessment done. This really slows me down, especially if a quick assessment is necessary. It's a durable stethoscope, but it's design slows down assessments. Also, the pediatric diaphragm is difficult to remove and put back on. It takes some bending and prying to get it right. I'm switching to an easily convertible stethoscope such as ADC or Prestige. I've given it 3/5 for its sound."
4,A true inspiration,"This DVD was a great tribute to a truly inspirational man. I grew up watching 'Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood' and it still stands out as a genuinely unique program for children, in it's one-on-one sense of communication and the lessons the show taught.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the inexplicably extended interviews with Joan Rivers (of all people!) that followed some truly moving segments that talked about his lifetime achievements for his sincere mission to reach children with gentle compassion."
5,Great for every Mr. Roger's fan,"If you are a Mr. Roger's fan, you have to have this in your DVD collection. Great story and behind the scene look at this show that has captured fans for generations."
5,Easy to Use Grater,"I love using fresh ginger in my dishes but hated the hassle of grating it on my box grater because the stringy fibers would get caught up in the blades and I couldn't use all of the ginger out of fear of cutting my finger. Plus I had to clean out the box grater, which was another time consuming chore. When I happened upon this fish grater on Amazon.com I decided it was worth a try since it was so inexpensive. I tried it for the first time today and was surprised how quick and easy it was. Plus I could grate every piece of the ginger. it is a breeze to wash up under the faucet and its also dishwasher safe (and microwave safe). I stored it in my drawer until my daughter saw it and insisted we leave it out on the counter because its so cute. This is my newest favorite kitchen tool. One tip for peeling ginger is scraping it with the side of an ordinary small metal spoon."
5,Great grater,And it's cute enough to leave out on the window sill. Wonderful for ginger root and nutmeg.
3,A Bag of Mixed Nuts,"This compilation consists mainly of pop songs performed by female artists, from Bananarama to Kelly Clarkson. You're going to hear songs that you like and some that you don't like. Other than that, this compilation is average and is nothing to write home about. You're better off downloading the songs you like and calling it a day."
1,Hoover self propelled,"I bought this to help make cleaning easyer. As soon as it came out of the box it went through a belt. I took it to a Hoover service center and they blamed me so I had to pay for the repair. Got it home started to have the same problem, mailed it back to Amazon for a full refund. Amazon can't be beat. Excellent service, great prices,and they back what ever they sell! I saw the reviews saying that this was a known problem, but I had hoped they were wrong. Don't buy one. You will just end up returning it after it fails for you. I wish I had taken that same advice someone else had left in their review."
3,good noir,"Like in Borzage's Moonrise, Dane Clark plays an unlikable angry criminal named Eddy. Eddy is an escaped prisoner who goes to his girlfriend Simone Signoret (the excellent French actress who starred in such classics as Diabolique and Room at the Top) for financial help and a getaway. Since his capture Simone has tried to rebuild her life, even getting involved in a relationship with a reporter who got a false scoop from her. Despite the fact that the reporter respects her and she is nothing more than a doormat to Eddy, Simone finds to difficult to change.This isn't a masterpiece of film noir but it's a nice example. It's directed moodily by Frank Tuttle (This Gun for Hire) but the fine performances by the leads is really the reason to watch."
2,Ignore this review - Accidental,"[Revised review] These people apparently have 2 CDs of the same title and the same price, and I reviewed the wrong one, now that I compare cover art carefully. Amazon shows the Relax With logo on both covers. I guess the price Relax With charges doesn't cover too many brain cells? You can see my comments in my review now posted for the other one (search on Mountain Streams)."
5,"THE TRUE DIVA HAS ARRIVED, LONG LIVE CELEDA !!!!","WHen I I first heard Celeda it was on Music is the answer and that song alone had me jumping while I was in Greece. You can feel the influence Sylvester has on Celeda. The only traq I couldn't get into was # 10. But nonetheless Celeda deserves a five from me, caus I've never anticipated getting a cd as much as I anticipated getting this on. My search is over, I can rest in peace !Eric a.k.a Johnny Rokko b.k.a. Ace"
3,It's all the same,"Got a couple of good beats like ""music is the answer"" and ""happy"", but it all sounds the same. Hard to listen to this more than 5 times. Save your money."
4,a great book featuring a variety of folk crafts,"This currently out of print book is one worth searching for, if you treasure folk art with a country feeling.The book features a wide variety of crafting techniques, along with clear, easy to follow directions. Sterbenz is to crafts, in my opinion, as Erica Wilson is to needlework.From stuffed folk art animals to wooden cigar store Indians, this book is a true delight !"
1,Not enough Color Plates,"I am a big fan of this genre - and the book is well written --but hey- where are the color images? There are dozens in black and white (?) but only about 8 in color. I understand that this is an art history book that is heavy on analysis..but color images are a MUST. I would not have purchased this book if I had understood how crappy the images are--what a shame. This is such a wonderful genre of art, and the colors are magnificent in the real paintings.I would not buy this book unless you have a great visual imagination.With all the fine minds, and excellent research behind this project..I wonder what they were thinking to publish a book about beautifully colored paintings..in black in white. The editor should be fired."
3,Why are the images so small and in black and white?,"You can't possibly get an idea of what the author asserts with the tiny black and white images throughout. There are so few good books on these painters available in the States, so I really have little to relate to what the author puts forth in her text."
5,Great book for intermediates to pros....,"A wonderful assortment of pieces accompanied by wonderfully arranged interpretations. The songs in here continue the Piano Classics that everyone should know and provides a nice mix of easy-as-pie to finger-bleeding arrangements.Playing from this book will not only exercise your mind and help cultivate your understanding of the art, but will also provide you with wonderful presentation pieces."
2,disappointment.,"Only half the size of a regular map, for twice the price. The lamination and mini pictures of buildings don't make up for the disappointment I felt when I received my map in the mail. I'm sure it will prove useful, but in a much smaller area than it should or could be useful."
1,Where is Capitol Hill????,"the map is portable,durable, but limited in its' scope. i plan on staying and touring the Capitol Hill Historic Area, parks and cemeteries nearby, but this map cuts this area off. disappointed!"
3,Downtown Details Only and No Capitol Hill,"I am a fan of the Streetwise map series, but this is a lackluster installment.The map covers downtown Seattle well, but the detail stops at Broadway. The backside of the map provides only main arteries and a topographic overview of the extended Seattle area.Unlike the San Francisco Streetwise map (which is excellent), the Seattle map does not include bus routes.There are better (and cheaper) maps of downtown Seattle available.Still, if you're only planning on visiting the downtown this map is useful and the lamination is nice for plotting routes with a dry-erase marker."
5,Streetwise IS Wise,"I have been a fan of the ""Streetwise"" calendars for years -- a folding laminated city map that always folds nicely, stays firm and fits easily in pockets, purses, etc.On the reverse side, it also has a wider regional map, which is helpful to put your travels into context, especially if you use the map alongside tour books that often point out destinations outside the downtown region."
2,EKG Pocket Guide,"a very nice size - easy to keep in one's pocket however the illustrations of EKG strips were tiny, poorly printed, and of little use to anyone except a very experienced reader. On the whole, it was a disapointment as the text itself did not provide basic information on most dysrythmias, forcing the reader to go back to a more detailed textbook. I would not order it."
2,Too basic,The illustrations of ECG strips were very basic and everything was in black & white. Written more like a childrens book. The topic of ECG rhthyms is a bit complex to be written this basic.
3,EKG Pocket Guide,I was kind of disappointed with this item. Although for the price I guess I can't expect too much.
2,Absolutely Not Recommended,"The information in this guide is too basic and quality is not good. EKGs are small. Nowadays I think this has been replaced by digital information you can have in your electronic device (cell phone, iPad, laptop, iPod, etc). Probably will be out of prints some day IF remaining books get a buyer (who???) ...."
4,a lot of travelling,"This is about 2 things - a cellphone and a laptop. Both are of course mobile, wireless devices. But how mobile? Johnson takes you through the basics of what you might need when travelling, be this interstate or internationally. There are issues of how to find hotspots (wardriving?). And having found one (hopefully), what might then prevent you from hooking your laptop to it? He offers remedies to many common difficulties.For cellphones, Americans have a problem. Their phones might not be as mobile as European or Asian phones. But Johnson tells how to look for the right SIM cards that enable intercontinental flexibility.In both cases, he describes what are now well established and reliable methods."
5,Great Tourist Review,"Excellent review of the vocabulary one needs to communicate as a tourist in a Spanish country. I've also used the same company's CDs for Turkish & French. Never got to use the French, but it was amazing how well I could get on in the language in Turkey. As for Spanish, I already knew most of these phrases, but it was good to review. The voices are clear and easy to imitate."
5,Amazing,This was a faboulus book I`ve read.Anyone interested with F-1 should have to read it.While I was reading this book I`ve felt as If I was at the pit crew of Ferrari
3,Who's in the band?,"I really do enjoy this DVD but when comparing to Herbie's other releases certain faults become glaring. First of all the overall sound and video production is no where near as good as Herbie's Future 2 Future Live DVD, then again that is probably the best overall production I have ever seen and heard. In this Jazz Channel DVD the drums are a little muffled and the acoustic bass is almost completely missing from the mix. The band on the whole also seems a little ""loose"" on the form of a couple of tunes and one gets the impression they haven't been playing as a unit for very long. My last gripe about the DVD is that no where on the back cover or anywhere in the ""credits"" is there a list of the amazing musicians playing with Herbie. Of course you can find out who the executive producer is but who's playing bass? Who's on the trumpet? The sax? To me that is a list of people who should be at the top of the credits... the people playing the music!"
3,Playing it Safe,"He's trying to freeze the calender at 1965 forever. I realize there are very few people alive playing this acoustic post-bop stuff and He may even be the best. However, Herbie's most influential material will always be 1968 to 1981, an era he seems ashamed of. He's riding the coattails of a genre he joined at the last dying gasps of, rather than continuing the genre he invented."
2,The Emperor Has No Clothes?,"Am I the only one that can see the lack of value in this book? Maybe others have stock in the publishing company, but I found this book to be without merit. It tells you nothing that you cannot find out yourself by just getting online and surfing around a bit. I'm sorry I wasted my money. I was looking for a magic bullet, but I got a dud."
1,Outdated and not useful,I found this book to be of no use to me. The information is not current and the suggestions are misguided. Save your money on this one.
1,I agree the book is not valuable,"I wont waste a lot of words, but I agree with the reader from Los Angeles. I searched this book for something helpful, and it wasn't there."
2,B-O-R-I-N-G ! ! !,"Making Chopin's etudes harder isn't much of a claim to fame. The ultimate goal in playing a Chopin etude is to make beautiful music after, of course, mastering the notes. What Godowsky did is sort of like taking a filet mignon, chopping it up to make hamburger, and THEN adding Hamburger Helper to really finish it off. The result is really dull fancy tinkling of the typical 19th-century-bad-taste sort. Sure, there's great virtuosity in the playing, but where's the music? Why tinker with masterpieces? This album might be of interest if you care about the history of the changing fashions in piano music and piano playing, but if all you want is great music, stay away!"
5,The Artistry of Tony Bennett,"This is a great boxed set as far as it goes. I just wish that his release ""Cinnamon Sinner"" which charted as high as #8 in 1954 would be picked up on some compilation by this artist."
4,Beautiful Mother of Pearl Face with a dash of Green makes this watch jaw dropping.,"This watch is very beautiful to say the least.. The look of this watch alone make it my favorite. I love the pearl glaze in the sun light with the bold green. my only complaint is the Japanese automatic movement. It seems to gain time if your active with your hands. Conducting a orchestra while wearing this watch, would be a bad idea. you would almost undoubtedly have gained at least 2mins time. I wish it came in a swiss quartz. oh, well"
1,Agreed,"I bought this, because I usually can enjoy re-recordings of star wars, I dont expect an orchestra; but this one is just poor. Yeah its 70+ minutes, utilizing nearly a whole cd; but for the same price; the 3 disc set ""Star Wars the Story Continues"" from The Netherlands is superior in many ways. Stay away from this one."
1,Possibly the worst commercial production of all time,"The plastic used to make this CD would have been better used to make styrofoam popcorn instead. I'm not ordinarily an active reviewer, but this purchase was so stunningly dissappointing I have been moved to return to Amazon to make this post. I can't believe that anybody actually put their name on this recording. John Williams would be appalled, I just hope he has never heard this, it is entirely disrespectful of the music written by him. The orchestrations are wrong, the notes are wrong-It's like a bad grade-school band performance where the P.E./Band teacher dumbs down the tricky parts the kids can't play. They don't even bother to use real instruments on the Cantina Band track. I have probably bought $10,000 worth of music in my lifetime, this is the worst purchase I have ever made."
3,What?!?!!!,"I have no idea what carey couvillon, down there, is talking about, nor do I understand why so many people found the review helpful! This set has nothing to do with a video game. YES, the quality is low. YES, there are a seemingly low number of tracks on the disks. And, YES, there is a reason: this was the last production of an old set! The remastered, extended, etc. versions either did not yet exist, or were just comming onto the scene when this came out. The compression rate changes, over the past decade, have also allowed for better quality, longer CDs. The 4th disk in the set was the whole reason to purchase it. In fact, if you can find it at a good price, it still is. ""A Hive of Scum and Villainy"" is a wonderful cut. The second song of the cantina band (Figrin Dan and the Model Nodes - sorry if I misspelled it) is a must have. Way back in the days when dinosaurs roamed the Earth, if you wanted these charming little ditties, you HAD to buy this set."
4,"its not the original soundtrack, and its not meant to be.","This is a fun CD, I already own the original soundtracks (the 1993 soundtrack anthology, don't yet own the 2004 releases.) \The best review of this collection that led me to buy it is as follows:""Spreading out the music from each film onto their own individual CD allows full length versions of most themes, with the remixing arrangements surprising and impressive. Given the often overuse of several themes, it's possible that all the music here could have been squeezed onto 2 CDs, and the labelling of the Luke And Leia Theme as the Love Theme appear to be the only pitfalls to a compilation set that gains some credibility with its thoughtful layout, but never can achieve its potential under the constraints of electronics."""
5,perfect blanket,this blanket kicks ass! its perfect for slightly chilly days or hot nights. super comfortable! even my cat likes it. its his favorite too!
2,NOT AS ADVERTISED!!! .,"Seller advertises this poncho liner as being ""wool"". However when it arrived, the product tag states that both the outer shell and batting are 100% polyester. Thinking about returning. Was wanting wool so I could use as a blanket around the fire/ sleeping pad/ ground mat/ emergency blanket or shelter. This WILL melt next to the fire, and if it gets wet...... Well it will not keep you warm. Very disappointed."
4,One of the BEST early house full-length CDs including VOODOO,"If you don't own this record, you don't love house music. Coming at the tail end of the 80s/early 90s, this is seminal, slick, highly addictive late-night house, including club anthems like VOODOO RAY and the even more amazing title track AUTOMANIKK, etc. I, for one, don't really care for Gerald' more recent forays into drum & bass, and I wish he would go back to basics. Recorded over 15 years ago - and STILL ahead of its time. Sorta astounding Sony released this underground house album on a major label? It would NEVER happen today. Same as it ever was...p.s. Watch 24 PARTY PEOPLE to catch the power of VOODOO RAY on the dancefloor at the legendary Hacienda!"
2,Purple,"This book was one of my $1 buys. It's an okay story nearly lost in a high pile of purple prose. I'm not terribly familiar with the universe this is set in, but it's presented in such a way than an outsider such as myself isn't completely lost."
2,Not for freezers.,I purchased this to track temperature swings in my freezer. Bad idea. The display was blank until I took it out of the freezer and let the unit warm up. The display started working once it got up to about 30 degrees. I am debating whether or not to keep the unit outside the freezer and break the seal by closing the door on the wires. Bottom line not for environments where the unit will need to be used in below freezing applications.
3,From the pioneers of rap music!,"This record is a fresh breeze in the rap/hiphop jungle of the late 20th century. For those who want to hear rap poetry from some old guys who started out in the late 60's when the Black Panther-movement was on the news from time to time. The Last Poets began as a revolutionary outfit, proclaiming black militant poetry in the streets of Harlem, only accompanied by a brother playing congas. On Freedom Express they're back but this time backed guitar, bass, drums and harmonica as well. They perform five tunes of which Geronimo and Un-Holy Alliance are the best ones. A nice record for those who have nothing against some old wise black consciousness. This record is not, though, for those who fancy the modern sounds of hiphop. But if you like some nice electric music with a message, this is for you."
2,Not Fair!,This is an OK book of ideas but it is the same book that was printed with a different cover so I ended up with 2 of them. I consider that to be unfair!
3,Boring,"Eh, this book didn't pull you in and the author must have a very grey, dusty view of anthro. Nice research on women in SEA, just be sure to have a keen interest in the topic, otherwise this book will make you pass out."
5,Great movies!,This will make you an Irene Dunne lover! The only one I did not like was Jane Eyre as no one played the lead better than Joan Fontaine ... but the other movies are just great.
3,Good but not Great,"When I first played this CD i was not expecting much, however the Tri-city singers quickly proved me wrong. This cd has a little bit of everything and you can't go wrong with Kim Burrell, Karen Clarke Sheard, and Kelly Price. Donald employs latin beats and music which is a welcome direction for gospel music to be forging into. Some of the beats seem to be a little too contrived and dated, but it is still worth adding it to your collection."
1,not what i exspected,"From tri-city i was looking for less hip-hop, and more songs and beets that put my mind on God rather than a club.I realy hope there next C.D. is better. Two thumbs down."
1,Yuck,"Sickening ode to one of the most horrible episodes of the 20th century, made all the more worse by its artistic sensibilities. Interesting that the beginning and end focuses on ripened fruit during a period of intense (and forced) starvation by Soviet ""heroes."" The Russian version of Triumph of the Will?See Kravchenko's ""I Chose Freedom."""
4,Sharp looking contemporary vanity light.,Heavy well built product with very high quality. Looks sharp in our remodeled guest bath. Shipping was fast and packaging was top notch. Be prepared for some assembly. We get lots of compliments on the mirror and the Kichler Hendrix three light vanity lights we installed above the mirror. We bought two more of each for our Master Bath Remodel.
2,Asperger's Self-help,"I purchased this book for my twin daughters who have Asperger's Syndrome. They are bullied at their high school by their peers and sadly, by some of the adults there as well.The book was touted as a handbook to ""help"" kids advocate for themselves. My daughters reported to me that it was a joke, and very cliche.Don't waste your money."
1,Horrible,"I'm sorry to say, but this book is so bad. It's a waste of money, time, and everything else. I might sell this book, but I would feel bad for anyone who ends up buying it."
1,Do not buy this if you want to learn or review immunology,"I bought this book as a review for USMLE step 1, and I started reading a friend's copy of levinson's review of medical microbiology and immunology. Not only is Levinson's the best resource for microbiology, but its immunology section is fantastic for both learning and review. I tried reading HY immunology afterwards and was only confused by it. It is poorly written and inconsistent, and not at all high yield--I wish I had not bought it. I guess there are some okay parts to HY immunology, but there are much better alternatives (Levinson's, How the Immune system works)."
4,Excellent read along for course work,"This book is well written and formatted in a way that makes it easy to follow along with a medically oriented immunology course. If you have more than a couple months for your board review it would be a handy tool as well, although First Aid does a brilliant job of covering the high yield stuff you will see on the USMLE."
5,Great review book,Perfect review book for the USMLE step 1. It is quick yet thorough. I found it was a great supplement to what was in First Aid and had all of the pertinent information. I didn't see any topics on the boards that weren't covered in the book.
5,Only one track shy from perfect,"I bought this gem on a whim years ago, and whip it out the first weekend of every December. I'm a big fan of seasonal music, and this is among the first Christmas albums I listen to each year... up until track 9. Then the kitsch sets in, and you'll want to skip a track or two. But those first eight, oh my - nothing revolutionary, but quite enjoyable and, hey, if you wanted something more jazzy you wouldn't want a seasonal album, and if you wanted something more seasonal you probably don't want jazz. If you're happy for some fantastic background music around the house, here 'tis."
5,Fantastic Christmas Music,"Like one of the other reviewers, I love Christmas music - all types from Glen Miller to Dylan but this is my favorite collection. I lost one copy of it and immediately ordered another. The songs go from standard arrangements such as This Christmas and White Christmas to amazingly creative version of The Little Drummer Boy (first time on the CD - track 5). That might be my only complaint - that Little Drummer Boy appears twice on the CD, but I really enjoy both versions. And the vocals on Silent Night alone are worth the cost of this CD."
2,Not my cup of tea.,"As in all the CD's in this series this is well priced and does exactly what it says on the label. But this is undoubtedly my least favourite of those I bought. The cascades sound more like a running bath to me. Rather than making me feel relaxed and lulling me into meditation they make me aware of my bladder and long for a trip to the bathroom.My advice if you want water is go for the ocean surf track, which is the best of the bunch."
1,TV Snow,"If you want to save yourself a few bucks and get the same effect, unplug your TV's cable/antenna and turn up the volume. Listen for the lovely snow sound that comes with the snow picture. At least watching TV snow is more interesting because there is a visual to go along with the sound. This CD stinks so bad it should be used to wake up terrorists for sleep deprivement tactics. However it may put your newborn to sleep, go figure? Probably because its the only way he can get rid of the noise."
3,Good... not great,"Overall, Liver Biscotti is a nice treat to keep on hand, but in mobile situations or serious training it just doesn't cut it.I bought two bags of liver biscotti to use for clicker training and obedience class. My 2 year old Airedale will eat anything, but responds very differently in training according to what treat I'm offering. These treats worked well for clicker training in short sessions in a no-distraction area, but that was about it.If I tried to use them on a walk or in training I would lose her attention and they would just disentigrate into a powder in my pocket or bait bag. Even holding them right in front of her nose she'd sometimes refuse them if she was otherwise distracted.The small size was very handy, but they didn't have much of a scent. I guess that would be an advantage in some homes, but for training it's helpful to have something the dog can smell."
5,"They're not kidding, dogs really do love them!","Could you pass on to whomever is in charge of the recipe that they're not kidding, dogs really do love them! My bichon is finicky, so some new treats I've tried I wind up giving away, she just doesn't go for them. She would live on Liver Biscotti if she could, and they are just the right size for her! I don't feel bad doling them out since the ingredients are so good.So my order was to send some to my sister whose Norwegian Lundehunds are picky, too. I guess a lot of your customers become proselytizers!""(...)"
4,Ellington's Three Suites,"I own a lot of Duke Ellington CDs and albums, and this is one of my favorites. My favorite songs on here are Duke's version of the Nutcracker Suite. That was the main reason I purchased this CD. The other suites are fine, but Duke's Nutcracker highlights his creativity as an arranger."
3,"Oh, Puh-leeeeeeez...","While the concept for this book is entertaining, it's execution is the worst example of self-congratulatory, 2-dimensional, claptrap I've ever read.Sure, according to Pollotta, he came up with this long before ""The X-Files"" and ""Men in Black"" were twinkles in their creators' eyes, but he must be slinking in shame to have been bested so effortlessly. While those two examples are entertaining and competent, Pollotta's effort reads as though he simply transcribed an evening's worth of conversation during a role-playing game.Worse, his characters are cribbed from the ""Magnificent Seven"" songbook, each more powerful, competent, smart or magical than the last. Jeezus Louisuz, doesn't he realize that what makes characters interesting are their flaws, not their strengths?The book is a quick read and kind of fun in a puerile way, but it's not worth the gazillion stars previous reviewers have bestowed upon it."
3,It's your choice...,I am not so fascinated by how this shoes looks. It's not so sturdy so I don't want to use it at all.
3,Uncomfortable,Didn't stick to my teeth as well as I wanted it to. Kept coming out and was uncomfortable when it was in. But it was cheap...so...
5,Excellent Compilation of Unforgetable Work,"As a contributor to the anthology, I am astounded as to the diversity of the poets who have contributed, as well as the excellence of the quality of their work. I am honored to be among the very well known poets, such as Alexie, Levertov, Forche, Piercy, Stern, but am just as humbled to be among those lesser known, but excellent writers, whose words are just as powerful and moving.A wonderful addition to your library on Jewish studies, as well as a powerful teaching tool for Jewish history, or Jewish writings.Sandra Cohen Margulius"
2,Just not enough energy,"I love Eurodisco and Albert One's music in particular, but his ""Best"" album shows that it is quite ok to stick to his popular singles released on many Italo Disco compilations, especially long versions, and anyone's collection will not suffer without this release. Even versions of famous numbers like Secrets and For Your Love are not as good as the original mixes that came out in the 80s. Most songs are just too flavourless for one to sit through the whole album. I barely take it out of my CD rack."
3,The Album Has Potential...But Not Developed To Well...,As the title says the album has what it takes to be a great 80's italo/retrodisco album but other than the 1st 3 popular songs that were heard here in miami in the club scene; the rest of the songs are really cheesy euro pop songs that quite frankly are in very tacky taste. The album would have been a hit if it would have included rare club mixes to his popular songs and a way better sound quality because it is not that great.
2,Poor Sound Quality,"I have been a big Albert One fan since I found him in the mid 80's. I have several of his 12"" singles. My favorites are ""For Your Love"", ""Hopes And Dreams"" and ""Everybody"". I bought this CD (new) to have a ""CD Quality"" collection of his most famous songs. However, I was very disappointed to hear the sound quality. Over half of the songs sound horrible. Only a few are listenable. I suppose I could try to return it. Since others have mentioned the sound quality, I doubt that getting another will solve this problem. Now I am converting all of my 12"" singles to mp3 files and then burning them to CD's....so now I do have CD quality!"
3,Quite erratic,"I think my fellow reviewer Mr. Ventura is right. More remixes of Albert One's important songs and less of his other songs would be helpful.I have nothing at all against music from this period (quite the reverse, frankly) but songs like ""Change your Mind"" are, at best, controversial. I deliberately listened to the album before familiarising myself with which ones had been released as singles. However, as I suspected, my assessed best three songs ""Secrets"", ""For Your Love"" and ""Mandy"" were virtually the only singles! (The exceptions were ""Hopes and Dreams"", which was also a single, and ""Turbo Diesel"", which is a well-performed and clever song).Chalk and, er, gold. You'll find both on this collection. The minority of good songs are very good, however."
4,Eccentricities and suspense,"This is a well-weaved, humorous mystery about the bad things that occur to the quirky Kelling clan, their friends and associates. I was crestfallen about the turn of events half-way through the book, but can't say why for fear of revealing too much of the story. Nonetheless, it was very fun to read, with many suspenseful moments. I especially enjoyed all the eccentricities of the characters in the book, in addition to the Boston setting."
3,A Great Read!,"As a avid mystery reader I found this book to be very exciting. I couldn't put the book down! It was never really dull or boring and had a very ingenius plot. Out of all the Charolette MacLeod books I have read, I found this one to be the best. It starts off when the Kellings go to bury an uncle only to discover that someone had already been buried in the family vault. It was fun to read and was very thrilling at times."
5,What a great mystery with a great heroine,"This book was a joy to read. MacLeod does a masterful job of creating wonderfully eccentric characters in all their glorious dysfunction. The main character, Sarah Kelling, is a bit of an ingenue, but with a backbone and a brain, and her observations are dryly humorous. In some ways, the witty dialogue and parade of eccentric family members reminded me of Cold Comfort Farm with a mystery. I say that as a compliment. This novel is everything a good mystery should be, and I can't wait to read the rest in the series. I just wish Amazon had ALL of them on Kindle."
4,Beautiful piece,"This knife is very nice to use. It has a balanced heft and is comfortable to grip. The handle is made of soft, light pine so is easily marked. Be aware that there is only one knife included in the package, not the three shown in the picture from Amazon."
4,Great Conspiracy Book,J.E. Morpurgo proves himself to be an expert on American studies with this work. The book thoroughly discusses both sides of the treachery act and gives a detailed account of the events leading up to the giving up of West Point. Morpurgo writes with a perfect mix of intelligence and colloquialism.
4,Definate Must Have,Maurice Starr has done wonders for his Boston Native..Homework could sing and this album delivers there best but the ballads are few. i personally enjoy Be My Lady..With more airplat they could've dethroned New kids On The Block..This is a collectors Item
2,Very dissapointing,"I recently got my hands on a copy of this DVD and I am extremely disappointed after acquiring it. I have an extensive music DVD collection and this is by far the worst sounding DVD I have. The sound is too low, particularly the vocals. I have music DVD's where the footage was taken in the 60's, 70's, 80's, or the early 90's and each of these DVD's have a much better sound than this DVD. I feel there is absolutely no excuse for this considering it was made when all this technology was available to them.The band seems to be putting on a good show, but I found it impossible to enjoy it because of the sound."
2,"Video OK, Sound [stunk]","I cannot believe they released this DVD, with this sound track. It sounds as if they are playing in a garbage can! I was really looking foreward to this DVD, when a freind said wait I'll loan you mine because I had to hear how bad it sounded, before I decided to go out and purchase my own. Man I am glad I did, it is the worst sounding DVD, concert or otherwise I have ever heard. Shame on you Image Entertainment."
3,nuetral opinion,i bougfht this as a gift for my brother & until he lets me borrow / watch it....i can't say one way or the other
3,I'm very disappointed!!,"Great show, poor sound. If you are fanatic of the good sound, not buy this DVD."
3,This carafe needs an Engineering Update,"Buying this carafe as a replacement for the one I broke finally brought back all of the memories of the things that were wrong with it in the first place. 1. The handle that is turned down is actually hard to handle and was the reason I dropped it after battling it for a couple of years. It will eventually fall from your hands. 2. The plastic top, which is important to contain the splash of hot coffee during the expresso creation, has three plastic tabs that flex in order to keep the lid secure. These plastic tabs cannot bend many times and break usually with in the first few weeks of use. The tabs break off and fall into you coffee. Additionally once you lose a tab the lid is no longer secure and contnually falls out when pouring the hot expresso out. I can assure you this one is my last one, I will not buy again."
3,Dolpin water sounds,The water sounds are so loud you can't hear the Dolphin sounds unless you turn it way up and then it's too loud to relax by.
5,A book for EVERY Century,"Every manager wants the silver bullet that will transform his or her organization from an also-ran into the leader of the pack. Dr. Jones shows us how, without preaching. In today's environment the emphasis is always on some measurable result - profit, productivity etc. Dr. Jones reminds us the result is not possible without the journey and the journey begins and ends with how employees are treated. Great job, Dr. Jones!Rod Walsh, Co-author - Semper Fi: Business Leadership the Marine Corps Way"
5,Very good!,"Adrian Grant does Michael justice by being so accurate and true!I know that they have been friends for quite a while but that doesn't change a thing. Grant is a very good writer and I'm happy that some people can really accept the fact that Michael has always been/ was /is /will always be / the greatest entertainer ever! As Liz Taylor has said: Larger than life!!!!!!!!!!!!And,yes, of course, I recommend this book! A+"
2,Could have been a great book,"This book could have been so much better. It chronologically details Michael Jackson's musical achievements in a large, clear format with dates in bold font. There are many great picturs, BUT the majority are in black & white. Considering the high-expectations for quality picture reproduction in today's book market, the lack of color pictures seems like the publisher is skimping to earn higher profits.As this item is meant for a gift, I can only hope the recipient is not as disappointed as I am."
5,Definitely for his fans!,"Adrian Grant took his admiration for Michael Jackson and turned it into a lifetime project. There must be something strangely erie about chronicling such an iconic man's life only to find yourself facing too soon the ordeal of writing the final chapter, coming to grips with the most monumental loss in music history.I'm sure there's a detail or two he may have missed, but I know of no other work that is as complete. There are great photos. It's not meant to be a classic coffee table book of stunning photography--it is as the title describes--a visual documentary.I've never met Michael but everything I've read by those who have convinces me that he left an indelible impression on everyone.If you're researching his life, or just curious to know more about his journey, this book is a must-have.My thanks to Adrian and all who contributed to its creation. My heartfelt sympathy to all of you in his loss."
2,Poor quality photos that are merely photocopied,The quality of the images was quite poor. Really a 7th-grader could have done better with power point and images available on line. The photos appear to have been photocopied. I didn't enjoy looking at the photos. There are so many better images of Michael Jackson. Buy Life Magazine's tribute. I plan to donate this book for a library book sale. It is not worthy of room on my shelf.
1,Not quite what I expected!,"One might think that since this book is a ""tribute"" edition it could be a colorful and ambitious item. Don't be fooled fellows! Close to 95% of the pictures are black and white and of very poor quality. I`ve been trying to get my hands on this book for many years and now that I have, can't help but feeling let down. Probably because my expectations were set on the pictures. However if you`re only looking for a retrospective essay this might actually help."
5,"Too bad, this book is borrowed!","I have just finished reading the 2005 edition. Too bad I can hardly absorb the content within 3 weeks and have to return it. This is a book you should own. R. Randy, author of MJ: Magic and Madness recommended this book also. There is a typo in p1, where Lisa Campbell spelt Lisa Cambell. Would someone please inform the publisher, if it is not corrected in the recent edition."
5,A very Satisfied customer!,"When I first ordered this book it was shipped with several blank pages. I contacted the seller and they sent another one right away. Unfortunately, the second book also had blank pages. However, the seller made sure the third and final book shipped to me was in fact perfect. Thank you for such wonderful customer service and making me a satisfied customer. I will purchase from this seller again! Thank you!!!!"
3,EXPECTED MORE,"I had hoped for more pictures, larger pictures, and more color pictures. The detailed chronicled tidbits of his life and career saved this book, although it did miss a couple of well known events. I won't be pre-ordering anything else until I read other reviews."
3,Very Disappointed,"I was looking for a book full of glossy, quality photographs along with information....what I got was the opposite...grainy, small, poor quality photographs with a little information, most that I already knew from other articles and books. From the cover, I thought I would be getting more of the Ebony Magazine photo shoot, but I was wrong about that as well. I wish I had saved my money for something better...."
5,Only the FACTS!!!,"I love this book it is the most comprehensive book on the life of Michael Jackson.This book chronicles all of MJ's achievements and humanitarian work through out his life with dates and it only gives you the facts no sensationalism here ""thank god"".Thank you Adrian for giving us just the facts without any bias opinion on what MJ did or did not do. This book is a must for all MJ's fans it will give you information that you did not know existed.Highly recommend the book for anyone interested in Michael's life work!!!"
5,MJ is a True GANGSTA Props to Da Kang of Pop,"Props to Adrian Grant for this Book. Elvis,Sinatra&the Beatles I got there albums&they were alright,but MJ Built the House Known as Pop Music. nobody else has taken Pop Music where he has. the Brother always makes Me Proud.growing up in the Hood from Gary Indiana to Becoming the King of Pop.the Man is a One Man Industry.Owns those Catelogs,Masters&is the Most Influential Artist over the past 30 years easily.Every Artist over the past 30 years is in Debt to this Man's Musical Genius&Vision.this is a Tight Book&takes you back.He is the Artist that got me interested in Music more than anyone else.truth be told:the Brother is Vastly Underrated IMO.He deserves far more due for the doors He Broke down."
5,John and the band pay their musical dues,"John and the band, featuring jug band folk hero Fritz Richmond, pay their due respects to their favoured musical heritage. The CD pays tribute to one of Johns earliest influences Gus Cannon.Worthy original tracks by John and the band, together with the re-writing of earlier tunes, mixed with some new arrangements of classic jug band tunes, make this a CD not to be missed by lovers of Sebastian and jug band music.The first J band Cd featured tracks by blues mandolinist Yank Rachell. John was estatic at being able to record with Yank. Sadly Yank died not too long after it's release. It is therefore a fitting tribute and a great source of joy to John and the band that "" Chasin' Gus' Ghost "",that the CD contains possibly Yanks last recordings.Daydream PO Box 5409. Alfreton. DE55 3ZR England."
3,jug band music certainly was a treat to me,"john sebasian's legacy is to make us all smile...whether it is just on his own(Welcome Back) or with the Lovin Spoonful(Nashville Cats)or adding harmonica to the legends(Tim Hardin's first album).In this incarnation with jug band legends fritz richmond et al we are all smiling again.Then he adds the magnificent voice of geoff muldaur(ex geoffand maria andsome of thebest butterfield vocals like small town talk and otherswhen he was with butterfield and the unpredictable amos garrett) and we are really grinning. True,john's voice isnt as strong as it used to be but if you are a fan of what he is best at(which isnt rock and roll) then you will find that this record goes just fine with your morning coffee.....nothing new but you'll be grinning"
5,I just saw John and Fritz perform,"I recently saw John and Fritz perform here in Santa Barbara. They were great! They played most of the jug band songs on the album and John told great stories about working with Yank. The range and power of John Sebastian's voice has decreased with the years, alas, but his charm, personality, joy, and vibrant guitar playing are still there. (He's a good-looking man, too!)He was a delight and this album is too. Jug band music rules!"
4,DOES make you smile,"I saw John and Paul and Annie a few years ago so was alerted (alarmed?) at what's happened to John Sebastian's beautiful voice. NEVERTHELESS, this is Great! The selections, all the harp playing, and the spirit of this is wonderful. I'm not real fond of the last three cuts, but that's my problem I guess."
4,A little disappointed....,"Even with all the descriptions, measurements and photos, buying a home furnishing online is always a risky proposition. This, easy to assemble, nice looking bookshelf is actually small than I anticipated and, unfortunately, had adhesive marks on the wood that needed to be cleaned off. It also had some indelible marks that would NOT come off. It does the trick, but I confess I am underwhelmed. Even with the amazon discount, I feel it's oevrpriced."
3,Could use some better tools,"Great product, but HORRIBLE Allen key provided. Could've used 3 spares thanks to the gigantic screws they provided. All the resistance in the wood tore the corners off the Allen key provided. I had to use an IKEA S-key to finish this off and that was not fun. Make sure you have your own..."
3,An average soundtrack for an awesome movie,"Much like everyone else, I was disappointed that they left out a lot of good songs that were in the movie and replaced them with songs which I don't think were actually in the movie. I guess they couldn't afford to use the good songs..."
4,Great all around,"This IS the best album of the summer. Great rock and roll. But where are all the other songs that were in the movie. There are at least 5 major songs missing from this CD. However, all the big songs have been replaced by smaller ones that are just as good if not better. My big question is ""When do Bachelor Number One have a CD coming out?"""
3,Missing in action,"I saw this movie Friday night and was blown away by the collection of songs in it. I was going to run out and buy the soundtrack right away. When I checked amazon to see which songs were on the soundtrack, none of the ones I wanted were on it. What happened to ""Celebrity Skin"", ""Semi-charmed Life"", ""All Star""? I'll probably give this cd a try anyway, but it disappoints me when the best songs in a movie aren't on the soundtrack. (Another good example of this is ""Sweet Emotion"" not being on either of the Dazed and Confused soundtracks - what were they smoking?) Even if the soundtrack is flawed, the movie is awesome! Go see it!"
3,"Great music, just not enough of it.","I really enjoyed this album, there are some really good tracks on it that convey the fun of the film.The one thing that let it down for me was that there were thirty-two tracks in the film and only thirteen on this cd. Seeing as how only 46 minutes out of a possible 74 were used on these tracks I think that ""Universal"" could have put a few more on there for us.I'd reccomend this cd, you'll probably be humming or whistling most of the tunes for ages.There's just a few more great tracks from the film that are needlessly missing from it."
5,The best song is missing - but it's pretty good,"this album is pretty good, but, i'm missing one, the most importatnt song, from the end of the film. it was played during the internet session and now i know the title of the song. it's harvey danger and thanx to napster, i own it!"
1,American Crap........soundtrack,"My complaint is basically the same as everyone else's. I absolutely loved the movie, but the good music that was in the movie is non-existant on this CD. Why? I was hoping to have the song LAID by James on here or Bare Naked Ladies. This was a total disappointment."
2,Missing Theme,"Everyone is looking for the song played at the credits. It is ""Laid"" by the group ""James""."
3,song title,"yea guys, the song being played while everyone is gettin ready for prom is called ""Following a Star"" by Duke Daniels. great song, great guitar licks. peace"
2,I know what song you are looking for,"The artist is Duke Daniels and the song is called ""Following a Star."""
2,song name and artist,"would anybody know the song that gets played in american pie 2 and american pie band camp i only know the lyrics: ""and she only comes when she is on top"" any ideas?"
4,whats the title of this song!,"this song plays when they show the hanging banner that says ""congratulations seniors"", right after they all toast to the ""next step"". if anyone knows the name and who its by please post back!"
5,Help me here,I thought this album was awesome and i thought the movie was awesome to. Please there is this song that i am wondering about. It goes on when Stiffler opens up the door and tells the band people that the party is not happening. Please if you know the song email me at bman@tcon.net
3,looking for song,im trying to find the song they play when mena suvari and chris klein first do it...i think they are laying outside on a lawnchair
3,The Pie Soundtrack~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.~.,"Basically this soundtrack is one of the most under-rated one around, not much publicity for the movie as well as the songs, this album chronicles each and every phase of the movie and it actually clearly reflect the movie itself.The highlights of the album is BIC RUNGA's SWAY, SUGAR RAY's GLORY & TONIC's YOU WANTED MORE..... Overall, this soundtrack is only ok, more to put you to sleep. But still feel that BIC RUNGA is a talented singer and she actually brighten the album with her clear voice. 3 stars to this lady."
5,Sweet!,This is a great CD! It is one of those I can put in and listen to from begining to end w/out skipping a song! It is Sweet! You have GOT to get this CD!
3,Great Movie but.......,"There was only one song i was crazy about, and it was played when the choir girl goes to see Lacross dude at his dad's store towards the middle end of the movie....it's sounds really relaxing....IF YOU KNOW IT PLEASE EMAIL ME WITH THE NAME OF THE SONG....PLEASE...littlebrother9@yahoo.com"
3,two good songs that rock,the only good songs on the cd are you wanted more by Tonic and glory by Sugar Ray. If I bought the cd those would be the only songs I would listen to.
1,Not worth the dough if your looking for the good songs.,"Come on people!!! Stop sugar coating your reviews. Like everyone else, I saw the movie, loved it and the music. However, the soundtrack does not have at lease five of the main stream songs from the movie that are popular on the radio now. Only Tonic's song made the CD. So if your looking for a CD with fresh new bands, this is your CD. If your like me, and am looking for the cool songs from the movie, DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!! The cool main stream songs did not make the soundtrack!"
1,Bad Soundtrack,"A soundtrack is always bad when it does not contain all the songs used in a movie. Where, for example is ""One Week"" by the Barenaked Ladies? And ""Flagpole Sitta"" by the Magnificent Tracers?They've included a pretty lame selection from the film."
3,Omissions....,"I just wanted to add some informations about the missing songs on that CD. Such as Celebrity Skin [Hole] (Tongue Tornado), Anomaly (Calling your name) [Libra present Taylor] (from the so-called strip of Jim with Nadia) and Walk don't Run from The Ventures witch is the song while Finch is running to the bathroom. beside that it is a good CD to buy. Enjoy !"
2,Looking for a song...,"I am looking for the techno/trance song that plays when Jim is trying to ""entertain"" Nadia. I have to agree with what Schmoozy said, ""A soundtrack is always bad when it does not contain all the songs used in a movie."" If anyone knows the title and artist of the song please post it! Thanks!"
3,The Missing Song,"A couple of reviews asked about a song that's missing, one that's also in ""Disturbing Behavior."" The song is ""Going to Hell"" and the group is the Brian Jonestown Massacre. Hope that helps!"
2,C'mon...it's not really that good,"Let's be honest, the only tracks that are actually good on this CD are ""Vintage Queen"" by Goldfinger (not even their best- try ""Superman"" or ""Disorder""), Mutt by blink-182 (even though it's off Enema, it's still a good song), and most importantly, WISHEN BY THE LOOSE NUTS. What a great song. Sounds like a decent up and coming ska band. Download ""Wishen"" and you'll have the best song on the frickin album. Don't buy it. The movie was funny, but the soundtrack is just painful."
5,American Pie is tight!!!,"When I heard this album had tracks from sugar ray, third eye blind, and especially blink 182 I had to get it. I was not dissapointed at all.All three of there songs are great. Also, tonic, goldfinger, the loose nuts, and shades apart have great tracks. You'll get your moneys worth."
3,Could be better....,"OVERALL A ""GOOD"" CD. I WAS QUITE UPSET TO FIND THAT ""CALLING YOUR NAME"", THE TECHNO/TRANCE TRACK FROM THE BEDROOM SCENE WITH NADIA WAS NOT FOUND ON CD."
3,American Pie Motion Picture Soundtracks,"Need help. What is the name of the title played in the moviejust before the school-leaver's ball, when Jim is getting his pigeon-blue jacket and Finchi is sitting in front of trailblazers hall.It's a fantastic song starting with a guitar.Thanks in advance for helping me."
4,Very good soundtrack,"I bought this CD for Dishwalla's Find Your Way Back Home (this is the song they play in an episode of Charmed), but most other tracks are good as well, especially the ones by Tonic and Bic Runga."
4,Good Sound Track,"Though there are many songs in the film not on the soundtrack, thats life. Very few soundtracks have every song used. This is a CD I plug in to my CD player in the car and sing and dance to it with my girlfriends while e drive around. We really get into it nd have lots of fun doing it. It's not rare to find us screaming ""If I'm leaving with a broken heart, you're leaving with a bleeding nose!"" or to hear us singing ""She only likes me when I'm high. She's always trying to get me stoned."" I think this is an awesome soundtrack that promises lots of fun."
3,Alterna Pop,"This CD is full of Alterna Pop / Rock songs, nothing too heavily popish, nothing too heavily rocking. The better songs on this CD are Summertime, Good Morning Baby, Vintage Queen and the alterna pop song Stranger By the Day. Although maybe Glory is a big rock song, and one of Sugar Ray's best songs. Mutt is another song for collectors of Blink 182, a fast paced guitar wonder. A surprisingly great song is Man with the Hex which is a big band hit full of horns and jitterbug grooves."
3,Song,"This is a good cd but they left out the one song I wanted this cd for. The one where the guy gets the laxatives and has to go use the bathrooms and he goes into the girls bathroom. What song is that,there's no words and it's an old song. Who is it by and what's it called?"
3,the missing song,"there are a lot of good musics in the film, but for me the best music is missing. that music it's the last music before the ball"
3,Where is Harvey Danger?,"The movie is a classic but the soundtrack is less memorable, partly because the catchiest tune in the movie isn't on the soundtrack: Harvey Danger's ""Flagpole Sitta"" (""Been around the world and found that only stupid people are breeding""). Save your money and buy something you'll play more than once."
4,Strip scene,"In the scene where Jim strips for Nadia, the song playing on the radio is not ""Sandstorm"" by Darude. It is actually written by Brian Transeau, better known as BT. Sometimes it will appear under BT's name, other times it might say performed by Anomaly, and the song is called ""Calling your name""."
4,Help,"Hy, i love the soundtrack, but i'm looking for the song in the end (end credits)but i can't find it on the cd, i hope that u could help me with that sending me the song's name and the singer. keep up the good work."
3,missing song,"hi i liked the soundtrack to the movie but i am looking for a specific song from the movie. it is the song where vikki tells kevin she wants to have sex at prom, jim is buying his tux for the prom and finch is sitting on the bench with no date. if anyone knows the title to this song plese e-mail me at Cutepuppy0726@aol.com. i would really like to find out who sings this song so i can buy it."
3,Barenaked Ladies - Where Have They Gone?,"I was very surprised that the track - 'One Week' by the Barenaked Ladies wasn't featured on the CD. Strange, considering that it featured in the movie twice. A number of people have been asking about a mystery track that plays after the stalling Vespa scene that doesn't feature on the CD, and this is it. Cheers, Chris Pitbladdo"
2,"Absolutely awesome movie, but...","The movie was awesome, but the soundtrack had no songs that I liked. I think the soundtrack was a waste of my money."
1,wasted my money,"loved the movie, but the sound track stunk worse than the bathroom sceen in the movie"
2,Missing Most of the Songs People Want...........,"I am very disappointed. I was looking for the ""radio popular"" hits from the movie. I remember saying numerous times during the movie that I HAVE TO GET THE SOUNDTRACK. No music from Jim's strip scene either. What a bummer. The other music is good, but if you are like me and wanted to have a good collection of popular songs without buying the whole CD of each artist, keep looking."
5,Cincinnati's gift to the world,I've lost track of how many times I've seen OTR play live (including the all-time greatest Emery Theatre Christmas show EVER with Jane Siberry) but my strongest recommendation is that I was willing to drive 5 hours in a snowstorm to see them. That having been said - this album is one of my favorites.
2,"great watch, awful band","I bought this watch less than a month ago, and I got this one because I knew I wanted a Timex Ironman (I've loved the ones I've had in the past) but I didn't want the resin band, because it irritates my wrist and my last one got discolored. This watch is great, and I use all of its features regularly--I originally bought it to time my runs, but I also use it to count down study time so I take regular breaks, I love having 3 alarms available to set, etc. The problem is, in less than a month the band is completely fraying! I have strings hanging off in multiple places that I need to cut off. I do wear the watch all day, but I take it off to shower. I just can't believe the band is falling apart so quickly. Obviously Timex has a lot of work to do as far as their bands are concerned. I'm not sure what to do because I do love the function of the watch itself. I probably will not buy another Ironman in the future unless they change something significant about their bands."
4,Great watch for 11-12 year old,My son is training for a running event and needed a watch with splits to help him train. The face and velcro wrist band on this watch are small enough he can wear the watch comfortably. He has worn it every day since we purchased it and so far so good.
2,"""Unisex"" Strap Much Shorter Than ""Men's"" - Too Small","I bought this watch for my husband, and the strap is way too short to be comfortable. It fits more like a woman's watch. Would probably work for teen boy, but not for a average sized grown man."
2,too heavy and clunky,"Way too much material for a simple watch. What happened to the simple ""pin"" design for watchbands? This watch has lots of rubber or latex material at top and bottom of watch itself, then the design forces the watch band to wrap over itself making for a very clunky, heavy sport watch. Timex had a great mid-size Ironman design for years. I find this particular design to be neither attractive nor practical. Went with the Timex Expedition instead."
3,Product works fine,works fine. just cant get the night light to stay on when it said that i can shake my arm and it should light.
4,Good 30-Lap Velcro Strap Watch,"This watch is a pretty good implementation of the Timex 30-Lap Ironman Series of watches. If you're looking for a sports watch with a velcro strap, you might want to take a look at this watch.Pros:- Velcro strap.- Ease of use. I didn't need to read the manual to set the time and use most of the features. There may be some features when you need to break open the manual but having the manual in a pdf (available on the Timex web site) helps alleviate the hassle.- Smaller than the ordinary men's watch.- Good timer mode: it can count down 24 hours in hours, minutes, and seconds.- Good implementation of the other features of the Timex 30-Lap Ironman watches.Cons:- short strap: 5.5 inches only in length of cloth section of velcro (I estimate that a person will have a hard time to put it on a wrist with a diameter of 5 inches or more).- the plastic strap housing can get uncomfortable"
4,"Great watch, as usual!",I'd like it a lot better if it had a standard rubberized band! A good size for my 12 yr old son.
1,Be careful - this is a rip-off,"The name of this book is very deceptive and makes it sound like it contans follow up stories in the vein of those in Deaver's book ""Twisted"" (which is also available in audio format). Lo and behold, it's actually just more stories taken from that book. This audio book should have been named something like ""Nocuturne and other stories from Twisted"". Based on other reviews I've read, I'm not the only one to have been duped. The stories in ""Twisted"" are good, but jeers to the publisher for pulling this fast one."
5,Two stars shine,"Both Shankar and Menuhin are masters who clearly shine on this studio concert. Rarely can one hear such complex melodies and improvisation played so perfectly. These two individuals create memories with their love of each other's classical music styles. Jazz, classical, Indian, and world music lovers will all be thrilled by this collection of masterpieces. There is also a companion live verstion of this album which is equally magnificent. I have used both as gifts repeatedly. Do not miss an oportunity to hear utter innovation."
3,"Too weird, too fractured","This CD has an admixture of Yehudi and Ravi. There are long passages of of only one of them playing, then the other, but not together. I suppose the good part is you get some 'pure' one or the other. It's entertaining but not GREAT."
5,Worth It,"Jam-packed with more clear, practical info than any I've seen. A bit pricey but it's comparable with other required broadcast texts and better editorially. My favorite was the Careers chapter."
2,"Good, but . . .","This is a fine book. I appreciate the concision and depth, certainly an asset of the authors' experience. This could be the best book on broadcast writing, but the price is too steep. This is a good $30 book, but to ask $50 is too much for students going into the lowest paid position requiring a college degree."
5,Comfort at a price,"These are by far the most comfortable & durable sunglasses I have owned. The only downfall is the price, but they are worth it"
5,Hella Cool!,"By far one of the best trance CD's out there. The selection is great and the mixes are unbelievable! I would list the good tracks on this album, but they are all off the hook! A must have among the community of music listners. Big ups to St. John and the bay area!"
2,Huge Disappointment,"Not a lot of substance to this book or any of the characters, which would be acceptable if the book was funny or had some kind of redeeming entertainment value, but it doesn't. I absolutely loathed the main character, a manipulative, one-dimensional, shallow, self-absorbed ninny, more obsessed with dining in four star restaurants and her designer clothes than in her family, her friends or her job."
5,"It's no mystery, Garcia-Aguilera can do romance","Once again Garcia-Aguilera has written a book that I just can't put down. I have read and love all her mysteries- so I picked up this romance with eager anticipation. I was not disappointed. The main character Margarita is easily likeable, which makes the trials she faces that much more intriguing. Sometimes you want to yell at the book and tell Margarita what she should (and shouldn't) do. But the author is measured in the development of the plot and keeps you turning the pages all the way to the end. Mix that in with an interesting take on Cuban exile politics and humorous insights on the world around Margarita and the picture of wild, steamy Miami is complete. Another winner from Garcia-Aguilera."
1,New Genre NOT a Success,"As a BIG fan of this author, having read ALL of her earlier works, I was greatly disappointed in this book. The plot was thin to non-existant. It was a struggle to continue reading, but I persisted hoping it would get interesting with the next turn of the page. As I read I had the feeling that the author had struggled as much in writing as I was in reading. In her future books I hope she will go back to the themes she has had so much success with in the past. They all were interesting and fun to read."
4,"Not Quite Hot, but nice and warm","I picked up this book so I would have somthing to read on the beach, and In that aspect I was not dissaopoinnted. Ms. Garcia is a talented and gifted writer and I enjoyed reading this book, and will continue to read her others. The only problem I found with this book were the constant refrenced to ""Cuban Miami"" and Miami in general, after the first 20refrences or so, it just got annoying. Also Ms. Garcia tended to talk give long descriptions and backgrounds that were irrelevant to the story and just held up the story line. Other than those issues this is a good read and i recommend it to book lovers everywhere."
3,Not tooooo hot..................,"I just finished reading this book. As classic fiction goes--it just doesnt measure up. However, this author does show great promise in her portrayal of the people she knows best...........Cuban-Americans. Her humorous depictions often made me laugh out loud, and her vivid depiction of the area and the ocean was actually intoxicating!The book is a portrayal of a woman at a crossroads--career as a yuppie attorney vs cuban culture of her family, Cuban spouse vs. nor'eastern WASP college lover from her past, childhood friendships vs complex adult relationships.In my opinion, the book and her characters merely lacked depth. The author knows how to weave a story. It lacked only the substance found in authors with more experience in this sort of novel.This is an author to watch in the future."
4,I love this book!,"This romance novel is right up there with the rest of her amazing mystery novels. Being a guy, I was a little hesitant about reading a romance novel but I just had to give this book a shot because I have been such a huge fan of Garcia-Aguilera's books. And to be honest, I absolutely loved this book. I love the way she presents funky Miami and its crazy Cubans in not just this book but all her books. Garcia-Aguilera did a superb job with this book, and I can't wait till her next book. You gotta read this book!!!!"
3,Interconnecting Cisco Network Devices,Just passed the CCNA exam with help from this book. The biggest problem with this book is the typographical errors that are very frustrating and some very wrong and confusing examples (ipx access lists). The material covered in this book is very good and very helpful. You have to look past the errors.
4,Excellent Book For Cisco Introduction !,"This book gives you almost everything that you need to start the revolution of Wide Area Network with Cisco Hardware that includes routers, switches and hubs. It gives you the basic Cisco IOS commands as well as the hardware information. If you're new in the WAN area it will provide you a smooth transaction."
4,Pretty basic book on Cisco.,"The information contained in this book is fairly basic for anyone but a complete beginner. There is no coverage of IP routing protocols. If you want to take it a step (or two) further, check out ""Cisco IOS for IP Routing"" by Andrew Colton. That book will get you up to speed with dynamic IP routing and should give at least the CCNP level information on Cisco routing."
2,tedious,"Take a decent user manual, remove 3 scoops of details, add 1 scoop of errors, 2 scoops of ambiguities, and puff to 5 times its volume with repetitions, disorganization, and verbosity, and you've got this turkey.See _The Switch Book_ by Rich Seifert if you want to know how switches work. See _Upgrading and Repairing Networks_ by Terry Ogletree for a good general primer."
5,Covers ICND Course Material Well,"This book does a great job of covering the 5 day ICND course material. It's a great addition to the instructor taught course. The nice part about this text is that it also covers many of the additional comments that the instructor may add during the course but you forget because you're focusing in on the course material while listening to them. It will definitely assist you in preparing for the CCNA exam plus a very good future reference for an occasional ""memory jogger"" of the introductory material."
3,Careful if you think this is the v3.0 exam book...,"There is a new version of this book being advertised by Cisco Press under the same ISBN number for exam 640-607... this is *not* it!!! Still useful, but it's plain as day on the cover, this book is for 640-507, not the new exam.What do you use for 640-607? Dunno since Cisco Press is giving the wrong ISBN... tell the world when you find out :)"
3,"Nice book, but not excessively outstanding.","""Soviet and Russian Nuclear Submarines by Wilfried Kopenhagen"" is quite an entertaining reading with many awfully nice pictures, some could even be described as rare. However one cannot help but feel it is lacking in many respects. For one thing it looks almost like the text is machine translated from German, with many untranslated German words. For another the book is rather badly organized with information tables thrown around everywhere in it. But still its quite a buyable book for one can never have enough books about ""Soviet and Russian Nuclear Submarines."" It certainly should be enough of a reason for anyone to buy it..."
2,A Disappointment,"This book, although it has its fair share of interesting pictures, is quite unimpressive. Was it actually more than advertised I would say run the other way, save your money for a better book. The editing is some of the worst I've seen, and the book is very poorly organized, with grainy pictures and (very) poor diagrams scattered about in hodgepodge fashion. If you're looking for an authoritative account of Soviet Submarines in the Cold War, you're better off looking elsewhere. Unfortunately, as far as I know, when it comes to pictures and diagrams of these Cold War legends, there are few other comparative books out there...Ultimately, I expected far more of this book, which for the most part proved disappointing. Again, its only saving grace is the fact that some of the pictures found within I doubt have ever been published in the West before."
5,Mind blowingly good.,"You won't weep. But you may.JCO is a moden treasure and is able to write in different voices, different structures and gives each character complete depth.Prose writing at its highest form."
4,A treat for Ponselle fans,"This record shows us a side of Ponselle I've never known before. I now realize just how hurried her old 78's were. The pacing of the songs and arias here is breathtaking in its sweep. And how large the voice sounds! No Ponselle lover will want to miss this one. Sound quality isn't always great. But as a companion to her studio releases, this record is without peer."
4,Great Singer But,"Not 5 stars because at times Ponselle sound like she is in another room and some of the selections are real trash. But - the warmth, line and drama are magnificent and in a few spots the sheer size is amazing - no commercial recording does justice to the size of her voice.Even Callas, not always the kindest or most objective observer of other sopranos, admitted that Ponselle was the greatest. Callas said that Tebaldi had a lovely voice but who cares? The thousands who went to hear sold out performances and the millions who purchased her recording are those who cares.Back to Ponselle - her line breath and dramatic interpretations are amazing - I wish I could have heard her complete Norma on stage. I know the critics hated her Carmen they said it was too vulgar. Sounds amazingly intense and vocally impeccable to me, after all, Carmen was closer to a [..] than a debutante."
1,dull,This more suited to someone with small children and someone who is new to keeping them busy. I didn't find any ideas that fit my family
2,not what I expected.,Just not what I expected. Rather boring. Nothing else to say about it - all the games I looked out were outdated or required signifcant set up.
3,Games to play at parties,This is a really interesting book if you are looking for different kinds of games. Some I had never heard of and some were really old ones I had forgotten about from my childhood.
4,Liked the book,"This book is full of games. Good ideas, even for those who have a great imagination. Offers good tips for games, etc. I liked it and found it to be helpful."
1,This is not a kind of games 82 yr old people play.,My opinion of this games is about the same as for the games for everyone. It is definitely not one I would have purchased had I known exactly what was entailed in the book. Not one for a aging senior adult.
1,book of games,"No fun games really listed but that's just my thoughts, you may like some of the games but def. not what I was expecting."
1,did not show up on my kindle,"I was not able to get this on my Kindle :(, not sure why but I will definitly try again soon."
4,in good company...,"This fine book collects a good number of the best selling series. Any take on the Justice League of America relies on a rich heritage & this could prove good or fatal.The stories in general are very good but the best read was that involving the secret characters of the heroes rather than the masks...In alter egos...Batman assigns the JLA to track down Bruce wayne... the idea...though relying on previous storylines, is fantastic...on the contrary the lengthy ""crisis times five"" is messy & the threat is rather ridiculous...still in everystory it is fun just to see how all the heroes interact & how each of them relate to the new partners...a very good read to the dedicated fan but the newcomer may miss some plotlines because of the everlasting continuity..."
4,JLA vs. the World,"In this trade the JLA goes up against the Shaggy Man and the U.S. Army, a former JLA-member, Triumph and a genie and an elf from the 6th Dimension. This story also brings Johnny Thunder's magical genie into the contemoprary JLA scene...pretty enjoyable. There's also a story that takes place in Gotham during the No Man's Land arc where the JLA is to take on Bruce Wayne in civilian guise. Overall most of these stories were enjoyable and I personally liked them. But take note that none of these are earth-shattering stories like the ones that you would find in the Tower of Babel or the Obsidian Age, they have no long term effect but in traditional JLA-standard they are just out saving the world and having a great adventure in the process."
4,Very Nicely Done,"A well put togeather paperback, continueing the saga of the new and improved JLA. As a longtime fan of the JLA series, I find this ""new"" bunch to be lightyears ahead of the old groups. While this book does leave you hanging at the end, the story in between is phenominal."
1,not what i had hoped for,"I really loved the JLA as a kid and looked forward to sharing it with my son. This trade really disappointed me and on re-reading has disappointed me more.Story lines: I guess they have run out of acceptable opponents--maybe cause they made the heroes so powerful. One story they confront 5th dimensional beings, in another book, 6th dimensional beings. What's next 7th dimension?Art work: Fancy colors but look at the characters: they are all standing around in muscle poses, hands on hips or arms crossed. The action seems cardboard. Those poses are fine for cover art but should't they look like they are doing things?I just think things in comics have gone down hill--I will get my son as many reprints from the 50s and 60s and let him appreciate the genre as I have."
5,Possible Other Thumb Ideas,"I LOVE THE THUMBATION SERIES! I can not wait for The Lord of the Thumb Rings, Thumbatrix, and WTW World Thumb Wrestling. They all sound great. One-eyed man rocks! I think that Steve should also do The Thumb of All Fears (The Sum of All Fears). He should also DEFINITELY do more Thumb Wars movies. Thumb Wars II: Attack of the Thumbs. Maybe also the sequels to the Godfather should be ""thumb-ized"" and also the sequels to the Blair Thumb."
2,Not nearly as good a Thumb Wars,"This was a big disappointment after Thumb Wars, which is enjoyable everytime I watch it. While Thumb Wars had me laughing almost the whole way through it, Blair Thumb only had a few funny moments. Maybe if you're a *huge* fan of The Blaire Witch, you'll find this worthwhile. Otherwise, skip it.Hopefully Thumbtanic will be better..."
4,Three thumbs up!,"The ""Blair Thumb"" is an excellent movie for Odekerk fans. The DVD would have gotten 5 stars had the menu not been so confusing. ""Blair"" is pure hilarious nonsense. My teenage kids and I have watched it many times. Jish is a crack-up character; a stoner with the funniest facial expressions. The two hillbilly-fishermen-Ned Beatty-fans are a riot. I hated the real ""Blair Witch Project"" movie but this parody more than makes up for that letdown. This is the first ""thumbation"" movie I've seen..."
5,Silly but good,This movie is cheaply made but really hilarious. There are a lot of great one-liners.
1,Anticipation not delivered&#65533; What a lemon!,"Man. What a disappointment. I have 3 of these ""Thumbation"" and this sucks the biggie!The only part that mildly amusing was the baby with the red eyes and the devils mark.I was hanging in there for the punch, but I didn't even get slapped with a wet fish... It was a painfully long, tediously drawn out attempt at.. God knows what!He has definitely done better. The whole thumbation concept is refreshingly unique, and could be a real blast, but you cannot just hinge it on that. Very... very weak.The only people who could really appreciate this ""slow pulled thorn of a movie"" are those folk who are hard-core thumb-addicts.If you have not seen a Thumbation, don't start here, otherwise you'll be really pissed and won't want to see another... which you don't want to do because some of these movies are quite a hoot."
2,"Talk is... cheap, but...","Stephane Grappelli talks, talks, and talks telling his own story of a 77 year career with: Django Reinhardt, Yehudi Menuhin, Nigel Kennedy, Martin Taylor, George Shearing, Joe Venuti and Eddie Lang, The Paul Whiteman Orchestra, Diz Disley, John Etheridge, Bing Crosby and the Rhythm Boys, Gregor et ses Gregorians, Lew Grade, Michael Parkinson, Duke Ellington, and rare footage of Art Tatum. This two disc special edition contains all known film footage of Django Reinhardt. A bonus material adds: 11 Bonus Chapters, 7 Music Archive Clips, a making off, trailer, director's comentary, Research Notes, Bibliography/Discography, websites finder, jukebox, Music On Earth Timeline - ""Jazz Comes to Europe"", Rare Stills Photo Montage, interactive Montmartre map."
5,A Musical Genius,"Ordered on 16 of Jan. received on 28 of Jan, and I am in Australia.What a wonderful DVD this is, it's more than I dreamed of, great sound and pictures. To see this great musician from an early age up to advanced age is wonderful, he has remained a humble man despite his genius. And to see Django Reinhardt play is certainly the icing on the cake. What can one say about the DVD except that it is a great pleasure to watch it. I regret never having met him or seen him play. The DVD is surely a must have for every lover of music.Aalf Molenberg."
4,SIX FEET UNDER ALL OVER DA PLACE,"Six Feet Under being one of the best,if not the best at what theydo.That being throaty death metal vocals and heavy hitting riffsget to demonstrate that on this album when they cover some oldschool tunes like Hendrix's Purple Haze,Deep Purple's Smoke OnThe Water.The original instrument work that was used on the origi-nal songs is upped and heavier but listening to Barnes growlan old AC/DC song is priceless.These guys also cover tunes fromThe Sex Pistols,Venom,and Scorpions(not Rock You Like A Hurricane).Overall not the best the SFU have to offer but I payed 6 bucksfor this and fell like it was well worth it."
4,THE MUSIC IS HEAVY BUT CHRIS'S VOX SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,AFTER NOT LISTENING TO SFU FOR 10 YEAR?i HEARD OF THESE COVER CDS THE MUSIC IS TRUE TO FORMAND TIGHT BUT THE VOCAL KILL THE SONG ENTIRLY.THEY REALY DID DO GREAT COVERS NOTHING MORE BUT CHRIS VOX JUST KILLED THE WHOLE VIBE AND MADE THIS UNTOLERABLE TO LISTEN TOO.WHAT A SHAME!
1,This would have to be the worst set of cover songs ever done,Ok now why would SFU make a covers cd with classic tunes like smoke on the water and tnt and various others? I know cause SFU is out of ideas and they were only cool for a short time after Chris Barnes departed from Cannibal Corpse. So all i can say is if your not a SFU fan dont buy this ...cd and if your a SFU fan just borrow it from a friend and he will probly never ask for it back thats how bad this disc is.
1,blew my socks off,"This has to be the worst idea in human history. The only thing I can suggest this album for is a few good, but short laughs. Their takes on ACDC classics are pathetic. For a good laugh I suggest their cover on Back In Black. If you can stand the first 30 seconds of it. What's next, a rap album by SFU??"
3,STRICTLY AVERAGE,"This is a great idea, but it sounds weak and humerous (at times).The first track is great, the best on this cd and there are also another 4 or 5 good tracks. There aren't really any real poor ones but the problem with this cd is that it sometimes sounds 'lightweight'.This is the problem with covering rock songs. Chris Barnes voice is good but not as good as in 'True Carnage'. (...)Conclusion- Great idea, decent songs but a little lightweight and humourous. Only for SFU diehards."
1,"Please, Amazon, give me a zero star option","First of all, I own all of the SFU albums. Haunted, I thought was great. The rest wasn't as consistent, but had merits. This album, unfortunately, is a steaming pile of feces. Every song covered is one that should never have been covered by a death metal band, especially not one with the marginal vocal capabilities of Chris Barnes. Purple Haze? Just insulting. Maybe next SFU will cover MMM bop, Dancing Queen, Mandy, and You Light Up My Life..."
3,Not the best songs for a death metal band to cover...,"First off, I love Death Metal. When I noticed ""Sweet Leaf"" on the CD, I was drooling to get it in my CD player... Well all I can say is the music sounds like Sabbath, and the vocals sound like Chris Barnes. Don't get me wrong, ""In Leauge with Satan"" ""Piranha"" ""Son of a Bitch"" and ""Confused"" are well done. But that is because the music is as thick as the vocals. Four tracks are excellent... but ""Purple Haze"" ""TNT"" ""Blackout"" and sadly ""Sweet Leaf"" sound too much like Chris singing at a Karoke Bar..."
4,Graveyard Classics.,"This Cd is great,they took other peoples music and made it better,the only bad thing i se about the CD is that they didnt do any of there songs,But its Great!"
2,an embarrassment to the original singers,"I got this album cheap, I liked them for a bit but the novelty wore off....I HATE Barnes vocals...George Fisher is better...anyway, if anyone wants to hear 14 butchered songs by great bands like hendrix, acdc and venom...here you go"
5,essential bolan,"this is an essential T Rex video for any fan. a fan for all 17 of my years, i just adored this. you're dirty and sweet..."
3,Snap! Crackle! Pop! - Hines krispies,"On the first five tracks of EARL HINES & HIS ORCHESTRA 1932-1934 and 1937, surface explosions are in the forefront. You can almost feel the tracking stylus being chiselled to death by the various pits and imperfections it encounters. This barrage of noise presents quite a distraction. Things improve after that and the listener is able to concentrate on performance, rather than record condition.It then becomes apparent that Hines had a nicely talented group of musicians who acquitted themselves well on some interesting tunes. The band swings nicely here, and the several sides that feature vocalists are equally engaging. This ""alternate version"" collection turns out to be a decent exploration of ""Fatha's"" earlier jazz orchestra work.Liner notes include session personnel and recording dates.TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 44:14"
2,Logic Unseen,"Mr Hopkins's writing skill and sincerity of presentation can'telude a few basic questions: why, with the power of invisibility,with the wherewithal to traverse interstellar space, with the ability to dabble with our memories (but not with complete success, apparently), should thealiens bother with us at all? Can't they solve their little problems locally? Further, where do they go when they aren't here? Do they swish through an abduction, return to their homeplanet x light years away, then return here for another go? Whathappened to the many reports of encounters with non-Gray beings? Are they excluded because the entities don'tmeasure up appearance-wise, don't conform to Gray Theory? Still,an interesting read."
1,"Oh, I get it&#65533; now they're INVISIBLE.","This book is a two-ring circus of patent, irresponsible foolishness. But this is the con artist's game. They fly their paper demons in the face of science. Anything but embrace the contradictions, complexities and subtleties of the universe. Carl Sagan was right, ""They laughed at Columbus, they laughed at the Wright brothers. But they also laughed at Bozo the Clown."" The baloney-detector is pinning in the red. Don't believe a word of this hallucinated drivel."
5,"Must read - Convincing, well written, chilling, entertaining, and eye-opening","This book contains the fantastic and often horrorific accounts of many (possible) abductees via the hypnotic regressions aided by reputable author, scientist, researcher and parapsychologist Bud Hopkins. At the very LEAST, this is entertaining and chilling, even if you don't believe it. It will open your eyes and make you thirsty for more... read Lost Time next."
4,"Offers scientific explanations for the ""impossible"" claims made by witnesses and contactees.","This book offers possible scientific explanations for some of the ""impossible"" claims made by UFO observers/abductees. It's paradigm is geared toward presenting how our current human scientific advances can explain things like invisability and psychic communication."
4,"Cool, cool, but not too cool","This is a fun video, no question about it.The boys on my team still remind me of the case of the ground ball that was literally ""blown"" foul. By the way, it's legal.Or team-mates putting shaving cream on top of one of the players hats.Or, better yet, some of the truly amazing and great plays in this video.That was the upside.The downside is that there's too much talking at times, with some of the players trying to do comedy bits just for the camera. The bits are dated, and at least for us here outside the US, are complete non-sequitor. Ugh. Leave this, and just give us baseball."
4,An auspicious debut,"Houser's first CD finds him straddling the line between angry and reflective (""The Dog Is Mine"" and ""River Run Dry"" represent the two sides to this record's personality nicely).His lyrics are wise and introspective, good enough to guarantee Alan Jackson won't ever record one of 'em. There is a refreshing degree honesty of present, unlike most of today's country. In ""Roll Along,"" Houser channels Chip Taylor circa ""Angel of the Morning"" -- ""I woke up this morning, didn't know your name/Don't cry mama, I'm glad you came."" Great lyrics throughout.This album isn't quite as good as Houser's second CD, ""Son Of A Common Man,"" in part because Mitch Marine was a rookie producer on this one and Lloyd Maines produced ""Common Man."" But ""Never Look Back"" is a strong debut nonetheless. Fans of Texas country/Americana/alt-country or whatever you want to call it will enjoy this."
4,Not bad,"I think Brian wrote a song done by Reckless Kelly (tho' its not on this CD). I bought this one on a whim and its not too bad. Not as good as Boland, Haney, Green or Craeger but certainly is a regular in the play rotation."
4,Entertaining,"I would call this a solid thriller, with hints of romance. Well worth the read if you enjoyed Snow Wolf, or Eye of the Needle."
5,Get up and dance.,"Simply put when listening to this CD, you want to grab your girl and get up and dance. Full blast from start to finish."
3,Just OK,"I Bought It for my Wife after she had heard some cuts on the radio. Not my kind of music, but it's ok for walking on the treadmill"
1,A Osler Service alumnus,"This book holds fond memories for me. I am an internist who spent one year on the Osler Service in 1960. I just read this book and it brought back wonderful remembrances of my time on the Osler Service. The descriptions of Osler's work, the pictures my group of resident colleagues and the summaries of each Osler Chief Resident are memorable. This book will become the first book I cherish in my old age as I remember the time that I spent at Johns Hopkins. Andy Spickard M.D."
4,A good watch,"Pity the DVD could not grant the whole scope of US Opens, as there were so many memorable ones which preceded those which followed from 1960 onwards. 1950 Merion, 1955 Olympic, 1930 Interlachen come to mind, just as examples. But what is presented is good, so are the extras provided. Could have been a little more in depth with recap interviews with the kep personalities from each open, and lets be honest, there have been plenty of those! Notwithstanding, a very watchable presentation."
5,Cinema Therapy Loved by Teens,"As a psychotherapist I find Birgit Wolz's book to be helpful. I work mostly with teenagers and have found that both music and movies have been the most important ways to reach them. E-Motion Picture Magic offers not only a well written base of theory into the idea of cinema therapy, but provides the reader with a marvelous movie index that can be easily looked at based on the topic needs. Teenagers struggles often with the ability to express their inner selves, but quite easily talk about the plight of others. Movies and their characters provide a safe environment for teens to express their needs. The tools that Birgit Wolz provides in her book enable the therapist to more skillfully navigate with both groups and individuals. I fully intend on maintaining this book as a great guide in my practice."
4,E-Motion Picture Magic: A Movie Lover's Guide to Healing and Transformation,This is a fun book to help people learn how to use moves as a tool for healing or opening up discussion. The one thing I would liked more is a piece about each movie. I use it with another book.
4,Good but where's the punk?,"I got this in the local store thinking there was going to be the song ""Hello From The Gutters"" which was actually recorded and performed by the actors (!). Unfortunately it wasn't on there and I don't know where to find that song or if it even exists at all on CD. With the exception of the two Who songs (especially ""Baba O' Riley"") there is not a shred of punk in this album.But, the disco and pop and such work well here. ""There But For The Grace of God"" was probably the best song with the best message, and ABBA always works wonders. Chic's ""Everybody Dance"" is another classic, though I'm convinced they used it in the wrong movie scene. Also of interest are the various soul and diva anthems. Of course you can't go wrong with the Who."
3,"Been there, done that!","The music is good but we've heard it all before in the past five years on every other 70's themed movie soundtrack. Is it a rule that the same songs be used in every single movie set in the 1970's??? With the exception of Baba O'Riley, all of these songs can be found on the soundtracks of ""54"", ""Last Days of Disco"", ""Boogie Nights"", and ""Muriel's Wedding"". The Machine's ""There but for the Grace of God"" is a rare find so if you like that song, this may be the only CD to hear it on."
1,"same-old, same-old disco songs","A big jeers to Spike Lee and the soundtrack producers for culminating an album of songs found on practically every soundtrack of a '70s movie made in the last few years (i.e. ""Muriel's Wedding,"" the horrid ""54,"" and ""The Last Days of Disco"")."
1,Astonishingly Poor Edition,"This edition reads like a scanned original manuscript that has had rudimentary OCR performed on it. Littered with typographical errors and odd formatting, it is nearly unreadable. An example from the first page:""yo American Novel fiat ever commanded to wide-spread an interest, at (his work. It has been madethe subject of criticism wherever the English language is spoken. On one hand, it hat been denounced at...""I'm shocked Amazon would sell this text. Publishers who take public domain works and re-sell them in such a shoddy fashion = weak."
3,Average Effort.,Most of the material in this small book is contained in every other how-to-write book.Sloane's wife hobbled this book together using Sloane's notes and letters and unfinished manuscript. No doubt the book would be better if Sloane had written it; it seems incomplete and unpolished. But I cannot fault Sloane for something he didnt do. One of the other reviewers notes how you have to read the book a few times to get what Sloane meant. You shouldnt have to do this. His message should be clear and obvious; he was an editor!But the bottom-line is: Is the book worth keeping? Yes. It has a point or two that are valuable and not found elsewhere. Like? The significance of the reader.
3,Two many loose threads,"This read more like a collection of connected stories than a novel. The voices of the three narrators are compelling, but the book suffers from a lack of focus. The central conflict, involving the sister's illness, is marred by her disappearance, leaving the main character to meditate about the issues of mortality, love and family, stalling the story's momentum. The anecdotes from academic life, though entertaining, are distracting, because the minor characters arouse more curiosity than the main players."
2,Swearing spoiled it,"Why does a man think that to be a man he has to use the ""f"" word constantly? In all its parts of speech. That was a major turnoff about this book, plus I thought it rather...I hate to say it...dumb!"
2,"Few words, tiny drawings. Not as charming as others in series.",Based on stellar reviews I purchased Charming Opal in paperback for my toddler. It was quite disappointing. We were accustomed to wild adventures and postcards. This one had few words and tiny blurry pictures that did nothing to help the absence of text. My toddler is too young for loose teeth (the book's subject matter) but the text was brief and trite. Other than that it was just a lot of white space on the page. We will definitely review in a bookstore before purchasing another in the series. This was a real disappointment.
4,lyrical wizards deliver...,"Trilogy is Souls at their finest, delivering raw yet intelligent lyrics with the witty,throw back laden, hardcore infused yet spiritual lyrics the whole heiro crew is known for. If you haven't heard Souls before, check this album out, it is tight. The lyrics will blow you away. These cats are some of the dopest emcees in the biz and can deliver witty lyrics better than most. The beats, some of them are tight and really creative, and other are just standard. But overall a great CD, hip hop heads and lyricist wizard lovers will find this release enjoyable. As far as those who claim this album left a bad taste in their mouth, I cannot agree with that. This album is packed with lyrics that dazzle and will tantalize the ear drums. Pick it up, you'll see, and you'll enjoy."
5,Trilogy : Souls return in full force,"Souls of Mischief return with their first major album in 7 years, and come back stronger than ever. Like ""'93 Til Infinity"", ""No Man's Land"", and ""Focus LP"", the newest offering from the Oakland based crew offers innovative beats and clever rhymes. This album is not merely another ""93 til infinity"" or ""No Man's Land""; the Souls of Mischief show how they have been an innovative force in hip hop over the years, as they return with innovative new beats and clever lyrics. Guest appearances by Hieroglyphics members Casual and Pep Love, as well as George Clinton of Parliament definately add a special touch to the album. This album will turn some heads this year and redefine Souls of Mischief's place in the hip hop world."
2,sold out,As a big time Hiero and Souls fan i was expecting a lot more from this album. There are a few good songs but not enough to warrent buying it. It sounds like they forgot what made ther music original and infectious and now rap about the same thing everybody else does nowdays. I understand these guys are suspose to rap about where they are from but I have met them and they are not at all like what they come across on this album and to me making music is about being real and expressing yourself not about making money. Of course I am a poor musician.
2,Questionably 1 good song,Love house and non overly repedative techno? This CD is NOT 4 U!!! was not impressed even with the d.o.n.s. mix.
5,Alternative Country comes of age,"Bruce Springsteen meets Willie Nelson, and learns how to sing. Heartland lyrics that are rockin', folksie, sad, and funny; this is regular guy music for the new century. Too bad Amazon doesn't have an alternative country category - would have made them easier to find."
1,Not For Me.,"I just cant get into Gary Chapmans music. This is a best of CD collection containing 15 songs. The best for me would be his singing the Christmas song ""Mary Did You Know."" For fans of Garys this would probably be a must have CD. It has some great Lyrics on the songs."
3,Nicely made,I have 6 cats and not 1 of them will use it. I've had if for a couple months. My cats prefer the cardboard ones.
3,5 stars for well made + 0 stars for cat's interest = 3 stars,"My 4 month old kitten could care less about this scratcher. He could care less about any of the scratchers I've bought him. He likes my couch and my grandfather's wing back chair. That being said I'm going to try to find someplace to hang it and see how that works. Right now it's bungeed to the ramp on his cat condo and that hasn't made him any more interested it it. On the floor, on the ramp, angled against the couch, he just sharpens his claws on the couch right beside the dang ramp. Onward for my search for the perfect cat scratcher distraction from my furniture. Why did I get a cat?12/11/12 - update - George has yet to sharpen his claws on it once. Used catnip, laying down, upright, in the places he likes to use the furniture...nothing...I want to try the upright post, but it's a big chunk of change to layout if he doesn't like it, either. I guess with cats it's all hit or miss. This one was a miss."
2,not worth the money!,My cat uses this once in awhile.Even put catnip on it but had to stop that cuz she was eating the catnip and it made her sick.Should be alot wider!Construction and material is top notch but thats it.
3,Cat doesn't use it,"Cat prefers the cardboard ones. Not sure if its this model or my cat. But he want to give it only 3 stars, so that's that it is."
4,Practical SmartCat Bootsie's Combination Scratcher,Perhaps I didn't read the info too well but I was surprised that I'd have to drill the screws in the walls if I wanted to hang it up.Fortunately my kitties like horizontal scratching and they start slowly to get used to it. Very good quality and non-slippery on carpets or tiles. Can recommend it.
2,Didn't work,"My cats love their scratching posts. I usually get the cardboard ones. I decided to go for this ""real"" one and they have not used it once! had to go back to cardboard..."
1,Should have gone with the SmartCat Ultimate Scratching Post instead...,"Decided to get this after seeing the SmartCat Ultimate Scratching Post was $50.00, but now I just wasted my money on this when I know my cats would have loved the other. :("
4,cat a happy creature,definitley a plus for a cat owner. lincoln has those claws ready for battle. thank you for the diversion. it sure saves wear on alot of other items (including me.)
4,Good scratcher,2/3 of my cats love this scratcher. Most of the time they use it as chair/lounge instead of scratching it. Would have rated 5 stars if it was a bit heavier.
3,I'm sure the product is fine but....,"My cat really has no interest in it. In fact, she still enjoys ripping the couch to shreds. <Sigh>"
5,Saved my furniture,This is just the right size for a cat to sit on and stretch out to scratch. I have it laying on the floor just a few feet from the furniture my cat loved to scratch. He now goes straight for this scratcher instead. It is low profile so it is almost unnoticeable for those who do not want this added to their decor. I have it sitting on tile and it does not slide around at all.
4,Good book,Very informative about what this country was like with Saddam in power and why it was good to get him out of power.
2,"good writing, bad mystery","I liked the nice English countryside locale and the characters are interesting and well-drawn, but I could literally tell from page 20 who the killer was. The clues are super clunky. I kept reading it because I think the writing is nice and the world was very cozy, as has been said, not hard boiled at all. But if you want a satisfying, stumping mystery, this is not the book for you."
3,Amazon; Need to Fix Listing: Extra Tracks not on Album,"While this is a great album, I am seriously upset because this is the second time that I've bought it. I bought it this time strictly for the bonus tracks only to find when i got the CD that it was the old original release. * If you are interested in the extra tracks do not buy this! * Amazon needs to fix this listing so that more people don't get the wrong thing."
5,Awesome Blues,Unfortunately R.L. doesn't play the guitar on this album but that doesn't prevent it from being some of the best blues to come out in the last couple of years. Anyone who is serious about good blues needs to pick this up.
3,Jury's still out,"I'm not quite sold on this recent rash of mixing Delta blues with hip-hop production techniques.Of Burnside's work, I much prefer ""Too Bad Jim"", I was disappointed with this release."
1,cd condition poor,"I was happy with the timeliness that I received this cd, but the condition it was in was not at all as promised. It said ""like new"" used cd, this cd was anything but! Completely scratched on the back and some songs won't even play through or keep skipping until you fast forward. Not happy with the condition ,they should have rated it ""poor"" condition so I would have known instead of misleading me."
3,Steamer Baskets,This set was for another person who wanted it after seeing how the food cooked with steam looked and tasted. She was very pleased with this product.
4,a line-by-line commentary...,"on the major Shabbat home prayers, especially the Kiddushes and Havdalah. The commentaries are from a variety of perspectives, both ideological (Reform, Orthodox, and Conservative) and subject matter (Tanach, feminist, halachic, theological, historical, etc.). I found the halachic commentary to be the most interesting, since it is of the most practical value for anyone seeking to observe Shabbat.One thing I would have changed: the 30 pages spent on Shabbat table songs. Because different families use such a wide variety of songs, any attempt to focus on three or four of them is likely to miss a lot of songs used by lots of people, and to use a lot of songs that lots of people have never heard of. I would have preferred to see the extra space spent on Birkat Hamazon (the blessing after meals) since that prayer is almost universally said after Shabbat meals."
3,Mostly Magical,"Bridal Jitters can be skipped,hard to follow,more sci-fi than romance. All 3 others are great. Each one different & magical & fun to read. Worth the price. Fun & entertaining. Don't quit after story #1,it gets better."
2,Yuck.,"Out of the four, only Jayne Castle's and Lori Foster's are worth mentioning at all. The other two are totally forgettable. Castle's is a nice little addition to her futuristics (little being the operative word).Lori Foster's story left me cold. It had the potential to be a great story - I loved the mind reading stuff - but frankly the sex creeped me out. I've always enjoyed a little kink in the sex scenes, it makes a story interesting. But the thought of ALWAYS having bondage sex, which is NEVER reciprocal... BLECH. The guy needs to see a sex therapist."
2,Meh,"Bridal Jitters: An entertaining story, but entirely too short. Of course in a novella collection like this, there isn't enough space alloted to tell a whole story. Castle, however, is ambitious to try to convey the entire world of the Curtain and Ghost Hunters in this brief tale. A lot of questions are left hanging, and one hopes that other books in the series will clear them up. Virginia seems lame, but I'd like to know more about Sam.Man in the Mirror: Terrible. F.Tangled Dreams: Decent. Kinky.Pandora's Bottle: Pretty good, actually."
2,A disappointment,"This was a disappointment to me, as I had expected a novel by Jayne Castle and the book was actually stories by different authors, with the Castle just one (quite short) of a group."
5,STEAMY! SEXY!,"Definitely romantic beyond your wildest dreams. Lori Foster develops characters with a passion for life and love. Tangled Dreams, one of four stories in the anthology Charmed, is indeed a spell-binding story! My only regret is that there wasn't more. I didn't want it to end, much less so quickly. ... I loved these characters and all they portrayed. Allison's secret thoughts are magically coming to life as Chase reads her mind -- word for word. They made me laugh and boy did I feel the desire the characters had for each other! Chase has a secret as well, and if it doesn't explode into desire for you, well, maybe nothing will!"
1,Collection of re-runs.,"This is a collection of re-runs. As I started to read the first story I realized that I had already read it. So...I checked the copyright and sure enough, these books were originally published in '99 and re-packaged for this edition. I always feel ripped off when the publishers do this. On top of that,they were marginal reads the first time."
2,Is it really Tristan,"I've read most of Tristan Jone's books, and they all have a distinct writing style. 'Seagulls in my soup', however, has a distinctly different style. We do know from other work that Tristan is a tough nut. He reports the only time that he ever cried was when his eye was knocked out of its socket by a falling gaff and he had to shove the eye back into place. He also, normally, uses as many expletives as non expletives. Yet in this book the writer seems somewhat less than rough around the edges, embarrassed by the usual expletives, over uses adjectives and metaphors that can only be described as cringe material, and in general portrays Tristan as some kind of new aged sensitive type. Having said all this I think the book is fine in its own right, but I don't like the feeling of being conned. I really can't believe that the author is Tristan Jones."
4,It's Townes...what can you say?,"I'm an unabashed Townes fan, so the man would have to do an N'Sync duet to warrant harsh criticism. I like all of his stuff, but this is definitely not a first-buy album. To have it said one more time, this album is way overproduced. The songs themselves are very good, however, and one can't deny that.If you haven't bought Rear View Mirror, get that and work your way to this one."
3,Caution,"Understand that there is a unbeatable copy protection on this disc.I had to route the headphone output on a discman to inport on sound card and into a waveform editor to be able to rip to my MP3 collection. Good Luck to You, By the by the music is great.(Of course I already knew that)"
4,Changed my life . . .,"Yup. I bought a tape version of this album for a couple of bucks somewhere a few years ago, and I dare say it changed my life. I can't promise the same for you, but it's a classic album by one of the great songwriters of the twentieth century. I give it four, rather than five, stars only because I found that the instrumentation took some getting used to. The songs, though, are tremendous, and that, after all, if why one listens to Townes Van Zandt--for the songs."
4,Nice Read,"The book was really nice to read, it gives you insight into what the more known fetishes are and their history."
2,Boring,"You would not think that a book concerning Fetish trends etc would put you to sleep but this book will. You may nod awake for the photos but the text is a mish-mosh of psycho-drivel, unrelated and uninteresting facts and sketchy history."
2,Too long and narrow,"I bought size 9 M and they were too long for me, but I liked the quality and style, so I ordered another 8.5 M pair. However, they turned to be too narrow. Apparently, I had to buy 8.5 W or even 8 W, but I usually buy shoes of medium width, sometimes even narrow ones. I hope I will be able to stretch the second pair out."
3,"Silly, cartoonish, but nice message about helping our environment","The three girls have plenty of fun running topless jeep and river raft tours so they can save the property from being taken over by an evil strip miner. Some scenes are like cartoons of Bugs Bunny and Road Runner, with construction workers blasting dynamite in their hands and walking away funny. The desert and canyon scenery are on the plus side as well as the colorful indian who finds lost bikini tops. More of our entertainment needs to contain a worthy theme like this one about preserving our open natural spaces from destructive mining and development."
4,GBORA,I really enjoyed this movie. Avalaon Anders at her best. Lots of beautiful women in bikinis and less.
2,Tastes Aweful.,"I know the supplement is cheap, but it tastes like the filler is rancid corn starch. You MUST take these on a full stomach or else you will get severe stomach pain and a horrible taste in your mouth. Seriously Solaray, just use sand or something inert as your filler. I'd much rather taste nothing than whatever it is that fills the empty space in your capsules."
4,Another great Byron Lee production,Some of the old religious numbers in a unique if not inspiring style. Would like to see a Jump Up & Wave II.
4,OUTSTANDING,This CD endorses the musical versatility of Byron Lee and the Dragonnaires. I have played it repeatedly and enjoy it more and more everytime I do so.
5,"Very,very,very good CD!",I definitely recommend this CD to anyone looking for a new sound in music. I guarantee you'll like it!!!
5,Mind numbing true adventure!,"This is easily the best collection of true adventure tales ever assembled. I was blown away by the courage, danger, and pure adrenaline running through these stories. My advice: run to your nearest bookstore and BUY THIS BOOK!"
4,amazing,I am lucky to buy these tiny giants speakers for 65 $ ONLY they worth it...........Boom tube is really boom
4,"Very portable, good sound, sleek design","This is a great portable speaker system. It travels well, comes with a nice carrying case, and has good sound. From all of the positive reviews here, I thought the sound would be louder and the bass more powerful than it is. The sound is great - just not as loud as I expected it would be.I use this along with my portable XM unit when I play volleyball, and it works perfectly."
5,"Very nice portable speakers, nice design.",Great portable speaker system in every way. Wonderful sound and very smart design that considers every detail.
3,Underpower Bass,"This device deliver wonderfuls highs, and Mids, but the Boomtube(meaning a lot of BASS) is completely deceptive. The device delivers the same old average bass as any other speaker sytem. But is great in design, since it is made from pure metal and can sustain the most severe impact. You would have to throw this to a concrete wall many times to even break. Forget cheap plastic. Please get the EX edition, not the regular edition, since the regular version will have very limited sound and lower sound wattage. Also, it is extremely lightweight and is enough sound from a small reunion. If you want a party, please get yourself a real stereo system, this is meant to be portable and powerful. PLUS it is recharchable with its great Lithium-Ion Battery. No more Electrical outlets. Take it anywhere and use with any device that has a headphone jack(MP3 player,cd player,etc.)"
4,Worth every penny (With one drawback),"All the other reviews pretty much sum it up. These speakers are and excellent buy. One drawback though. The first time I went to use them was on a road trip. At some point the power button got bumped through the soft case that is supplied. I was telling everybody how great the speakers sounded, but no one could experience it with a dead battery. It would have been nice if Virgin made the power button recessed. Now I keep a plastic tube over the speakers in the case."
3,"Boomtube...best portable speaker for MP3, but expensive","This works well. Some talk about it being really loud, but it could be a lot louder. It will be fine for listening to in a small room or maybe on the patio, but don't expect to be able to crank this up enough for a loud dance party. It isn't THAT loud. Too much $$ for what you get also. It does fill a certain niche though. I also have a Creative portable travel speaker and it is nearly as loud, but lacks the bass and fidelity of this system. The rechargable battery is a plus for the Boomtube as well."
1,"""Goes up to 11?"" Eleven what -- 11/10 of a decibel?","I guess my definitions of ""super loud,"" ""great sound, ""biggest, baddest bass possible"" and ""perfectly portable"" are so completely different from those of the manufacturer and most of the other reviewers. Even turned all the way to ""11,"" the volume is woefully inadequate. And no bass to speak of. Even tried connecting a Boostaroo portable amplifier but still underpowered with a tinny sound quality. In addition, the product is very big and heavy with large, long, ungainly wires protruding from the back. If I had not thrown away the box before trying it (mistakenly believing the claims made on this product page), it would have been sent back immediately."
1,Boomtube Ex Defective,Product came defective and they didn't have another one to replace it. So I'm pretty upset about that
4,Big Bang For The Bucks!!,"After reading a few poor reviews I had to get my two cents in. The only problem I've had with the unit is the battery light even at fully charged it stays amber/red not green. The battery only charges when the green light is flashing not in the on or steady green light mode which is acceptable and can be worked around. This unit has Great Sound with nice bass range. One guy is comparing them to his ""Cambridge Soundworks Twelve"" system. WELL EXCUSE ME!!! this is a moderate $80 unit not a $400-$500 system he is comparing it to. I have heard both the JBL tour and JBL Stage and this Blows them away with sharp crisp highs and a rich base sound. After hearing this unit both JBL ownerswere saying ""I Like.."" and ""I Gotta get me one"". Don't let the negative reviews dissuade you from purchasing this Boomtube inmy opionion it rocks. I wanted to give it 4 1/2 stars becauseof the battery light since I couldn't it came in as 4 stars.- 1 star for battery light"
4,Bargain Shopper,"Im a very frugal person. So natuarlly getting these three pieces for so cheap caught my attention. I really just needed a car charger at the time, but the last one I bought from the cingular store was $20. This was a great buy. It works well so far. I have had it for maybe a month or so now, and I am very satisfied. The charger works how it should, the case fits my phone well. Now when I drop it like I so often do, it doesn't bust open and the battery fly off. The ear piece is really the only reason I didn't give a 5 out of 5. Although it still works well it is a bit ""tunnel-like"" sounding sometimes..but hey, it still works and I have been able to sucessfully use it."
4,Amazing Singer!,"As a long time fan of Eric Martin I can highly recommend this CD! Usually Eric writes most of his own material and even though that's not the case on this piece of work, these songs are the perfect showcase for his incredible voice and he sounds amazing on each and every one of these songs. I'm Only Fooling Myself, Everytime I Think of You and Confess are the stand-outs. Bought this album when it orginally came out on casette tape and actually wore it out on my car stereo. Crank it up and enjoy."
1,Sucked!,"If there was anything less than one star, thats what I would rate this movie. I had to stop the movie in the middle it was so bad! My advise to you is not to purchase this horrible piece of workmanship."
2,Not what you get in the starbucks,"I'm really disappointed that this tastes so horrible. I thought it will be similar to the starbucks green tea latte. NOT AT ALL. If you are seeking some starbucks replacement, avoid this. But I'm not sure if you hate starbucks and prefer this concentrate. U know, people really differ in taste."
2,Tazo Matcha Green Tea Concentrate,"I was hoping this would be like Starbuck's green tea latte, but it's not. The melon flavor added does it a disservice in my opinion. It lacks the green ""seaweedy"" flavor I like so much, and doesn't taste like green tea at all to me. Makes a decent tasting ""drink"" though, if you have no preconceptions."
1,"Tastes like rotten melon, looks the color of the dead","Do not buy! Does not compare to what you order from a coffee shop. When prepared, it has the color of dead zombie flesh and tastes like a rotten honeydew melon. Green Tea flavor is not detected. Disgusting and unpalatable."
4,Yummy and invigorating!,"I was pleasantly surprised as to how delicious Tazo Matcha Green Tea Latte Concentrate was! I drank my first steaming cup on the way to rehearsals and found myself alert, clear, calm, energized all afternoon. Easy and quick to prepare, delightfully tasty, and a wonderful pick-me-up. Also, it is so very good for you!"
5,A favorite of mine,"I can agree that this book would not be for everyone. If you have grown up romanticizing horses and cowboys and you thought this might transport you further along that path, you might not find this book enjoyable. However, if you actually grew up on a ranch and were horseback from the age of 6, you will love the biting wit Mr. Ulph uses to describe the equine experience. He doesn't forget about the bovines either. He gives them equal amounts of center stage. I loved this book and have given several copies away as gifts to both my cowboy friends and the ones that ""wannabe""."
1,A Good Try,"This is a good first effort at combining an honest depiction of the west with sardonic wit. Unfortunately, it is sophomoric and banal."
1,Save Your Money !!!!,"My father had this book in his collection and it appeared to be an interesting book in the beginning. Its novelty and humor soon grew thin, and it seemed as though the author engaged in stream of conscious jabber. Pass on this one...."
1,Abstract,"The writing of Mr. Ulph is too abstract and leaves too much to the imagine. Pity, he takes topics with interest and potential and then slowly loses the reader's interest by infusing his own personality into the word paintings he is trying to draw."
1,From a Real Cow Poker,The last reviewer almost got it almost right. Dr. Ulph was a cowpoker who poked one too many cows.
1,A Sad Disappointment,"Like Bill Clinton, this author has tremendous potential but in the end is a let down. The book could have been an honest and enlightening exploration of the cowboy and not the myth, but is simply pedantic satire and sarcasm. Instead of the myth, we get the author's views - when what one hopes for is a clear and undistorted picture/"
1,no redeeming social - or any other - value.,"Boy, it's not often you find a film that is this amateurish in so many ways. The comedy isn't funny, the nudity is anerotic. The plot makes no sense. It has terrible pacing and editing and cinematography and so forth and so on.If the dialog had been written by Ed Wood, it would be exactly like an Ed Wood film, and that would be a major improvement."
5,Very good,This CD is great. The music is nice. I could listen to it all the time. The Darling Buds are great. This CD is not that hard to get so why don't you go get yourself a copy of it. My favorite song on it is So Close.
4,Consistently catchy pop,"I think the comments from other reviewers are pretty accurate. I just thought I'd add one more thing.I've had the experience several times of liking one track from a band, buying the album, and finding that the rest of it doesn't sound like the track I like. That is NOT the case here. If you've heard ""Crystal Clear"" or one of the other tracks, then rest assured that it represents the sound of the band and the album.I give it 4 stars out of 5 because it's not exactly a life-changing album but it is very fun and listenable all the way through. I have no complaints at all - I'm glad I bought it."
3,College Rock Circa 1990,"The Darling Buds did not change the world, but they made some pretty good melodic-kind of bubblegummy-guitar pop in their day. It's a guitar-bass-drums-poppy female vocal lineup. This album came out before Smells Like Teen Spirit and grunge changed the face of ""alternative music"", and is pretty representative of what US college radio stations were playing at the time. Crystal Clear and It Makes No Difference are two of the catchiest tunes. The Primitives are (were) a similar band."
3,"""Darling"" alt-pop.","I have to credit late night MTV with my exposure to ""Darling Buds"". The 1990 video was for ""Crystal Clear"", and I've liked that song ever since. It's easily the best track on here, and I think ""Tiny Machine"" was a minor hit as well. The rest of the album is good, just not as sweet as the first few tracks. This group actually reminds me of two other of my favorite bands from the era, those being ""Lush"" a little bit, and ""The Primitives"" alot. It's just that female voice over catchy alt-pop that's hard to resist. Check it out if you can find it."
5,Forgot to add one more recommendation..,"The closest thing I've found to the Three Seasons soundtrack is David Parson's ""Ngaio Gamelan"". However it is a bit more repetitive and doesn't have the vocals. But check it out."
5,Attaining Equality....,"When this book was first released, it angered many members of the gay community and it's easy to see why. Bawer, a self professed conservative, lambasts more liberal gay rights advocates who believe in visibility at any cost. According to Bawer, this approach inevitably destroys any credibility the gay rights movement hopes to attain. True success can only be had if those interested in equality are able to work within the system in a manner that is non threatening to the majority of heterosexuals in power. Whether you agree with Bawer's approach or not, this is a book that must be read by anyone interested in the debate over the best way to establish gay and lesbian equality in this country."
5,Excellent book,"Bawer has a great insight into the inequites handed to the gay community, but also the flaws from within. For all those who doubt that gays are thoughtful, and speak from many perspectives, this book is not to be missed."
2,A tangle of hair.,"The reason I bought this shampoo is because I love the leave in Argan oil.My hair has a keratin treatment, and is pretty decent. My texture is about a 4a or 4b.The first time I used it, it felt a little brittle, but I thought, I give it another try.I used it along with the conditioner, my hair was tangle and brittle, but it felt clean. To make my hair a little softer I used Neutrogena triple moisture after the wash.Second time I used it with the mask, and was a little better but still tangles. I will finish the bottle but will not purchase again. Thank Goodness Neutrogena's hair mask saves the day."
3,"Smells great, average product","This stuff smells great! But it is just average on my hair, which is on the dry side. I wish it was better but it's not. I find it disappointing that the product is named Dermorganic but it has few organic ingredients....but that was not my point in buying it. I wanted a product to help my dry hair and this isn't as good as I was hoping it would be!"
3,"Good shampoo, poor bottle",I like the shampoo but it's too thick to work in the pump. I have to take the pump out each time to use it.
3,"I don't see ""amazing"" difference","After using a month or so I don't see big changes; my hair are still frizzy and out of control. However, I like the smell and feeling after using it. I noticed overall look of my hair got better, not sure bz of this shampoo or other products I was trying.But is is not so bad and not itchy :-)"
2,Not as good as Wen,I bought this because I like Wen but not the price tag. DermOrganic does have a nice lather but thats it. It left mine and my 3 yr old daughters hair so dry that I couldnt even brush through it while it was wet. I noticed that her hair has been very tangley since using it. Im returning it and going back to Wen..
1,NOT organic,"This product is NOT organic! It IS free of paraben free and free of other ""bad"" ingredients but it's also free of organic ingredients. #misleading."
3,Just OK,This shampoo is just ok because you HAVE to use the conditioner with it or else it leaves your hair very dry and fly away
1,VERY Disappointed!,"I feel like when I read back on the reviews (which I also read prior to ordering), I am reading about a different product. I was looking for something sulfate-free like Wen, that didn't foam and was gentle on my hair. This stuff leaves my fine hair feeling like straw - and I don't process my hair, so I'm confused as to how other reviewers have had such luck with it. This may work for thick/ coarse hair as some other reviewers have described but I DON'T recommend for fine hair. It really just tangles and tangles and strips my hair. It's not good! And, of course, it does foam which shame on me for not being more aware but I thought sulfate-free shampoos were not supposed to foam??? Anyway, not good shampoo for fine hair. VERY disappointed. Stick with Wen!"
2,"Dissapointing, can't use the product","The pump doesn't work since day 1, so I can't get the product out of the bottle (the bottleneck is too thin for such a thick product). I called the manufacturer and their customer service is terrible, they could only say that I would get a refund if I bought it on Amazon. Unfortunately I started using it (or trying to use it for the first time) 50 days after I bought it, so Amazon won't refund my money. Dissapointing. I will never buy any other Dermorganic product ever (or any other personal care item from Amazon).I rated it 2 stars vs one becasuse I was able to pull a little bit of the product at the top out with my finger, and it smelled nice."
1,Disaster: do not buy,"not only did the handle not work and I had to manually get the shampoo out, but the shampoo itself is horrible, worst product I have ever used: completely dried my skin and gave me dandruff. I have never been disappointed in anything like that before."
1,shampoo doesn't lather,You have to use a lot of this shampoo to get it to lather. I will not buy this again.
3,Terrible Lather,"It says it has an ""rich luxurious lather"" on the back, and it is the total opposite of that. Maybe its just my hair, but the lather is terrible and it doesn't feel like its cleaning my hair at all. Obviously, I somewhat expected it to be like that, because its sulfate free. I just don't like how they put that on the back. It makes me wonder about what else they claim. Other than that, its an okay shampoo. I definitely recommend it if you can find it for a cheap price. They sell this shampoo at TJ Maxx for 33.8 oz. for only $20. I'd say its worth about that price."
3,Could Be Better,"I have very itchy dry scalp and fine thick hair. This shampoo is great for fine hair-it doesn't weigh your hair down. But after about 5 shampoos--you have to use something else for the build-up. It does help with the itchy, dry scalp till the build-up sets in (makes me think it's not truly sulfate-free)."
3,pretty good,I like the convenience of there being several different short workouts that you can do together or separately. The thighs workouts were great... lots of pain the next day which is a good sign. The butt workout wasn't as great - at least for me. I had trouble getting the moves exactly right and I never felt anything. The pretzel seemed better than the standing/kneeling thigh though. The moves are very simple but I think you have to do them exactly right to feel it.
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING!!,"If you have either of the other two Core videos, don't waste your money on this one! With the exeption of one 10-minute segment, the exercises here can all be found in Core Pilates or Core Body Sculpt. If I hadn't opened the package, I would have sent this one back for a refund."
1,Not a fan!,"I am an active person doing running/swimming/Pilate religiously 6 times a week. I used the first two ten minutes of this DVD twice and every time I did the routines, I had a very very sore knee afterward. The pain is not in any of the thigh muscles as I was hoping for but inside of my knees. The workouts in the ten minutes were very boring with not much variation. I personally don't think any workout that is causing a joint pain not the muscle soreness is healthy to do."
2,Too much waisted time..,"It seemed to me that half of the video was composed of the ""warming up"" exercise. After the first warm up high knee lifts I was already warmed up. I didn't need to do it before each exercise, and I thought that they could have had a lot more workouts if they had cut out the warm up before each workout. It seemed like an unnecessary time filler."
2,"I agree, it's boring",I've just done the 5 workouts today and I found them pretty boring. I don' t like their voices recorded over the images. It will be dificult to know if it is effective because I don't want to give it a second try. Too boring
1,Not good for the back!,"I did this workout when it came on Fit TV. That was 3 days ago and I have had moderate lower back pain ever since. I am a reasonably fit person and I do yoga regularly, so it's not a question of my fitness level/form or flexibility. I do not recommend this to anyone!!"
4,Good workout DVD,The ten minute sessions are good if you want to work out more or less on different days. The workouts are targeted and effective.
3,Not as good as...,"Core Fusion Body Sculpt - which I absolutley LOVE & that's why I ordered Thighs & Glutes. Many of the ""small movements & hip rotations"" are diffiult to see on the dvd. Hard to know if you are doing something correctly. Maybe some different camera angles would have been helpful - instead of just a side view? I also found some of the stretches very awkward. Love Elisabeth & Fred though & looking forward to the new Lean & Toned dvd."
2,Not for bad knees,"While this DVD may work, it really hurt my knees. They offered variations if you have knee problems, but the standing poses were still really too much for my knees. They were tingling after just the first workout. Also, when I work out, I prefer not to use props. I don't have a chair of the right height in my house for these poses."
4,Bobby Bare - It's about time,"Simply put, I've been waiting 25 years for this album to come out on CD. For shear fun, it's one of the greatest country albums of all time and one of the best live albums of any genre."
1,Jumping the Shark,"This book never finds its plot, and like a sitcom passed its prime, jumps the shark repeatedly in an effort to distract the reader from this potboiler drivel and at the same inject forward motion into the book. This might be one of the worst books I have ever read. Which is really too bad, because the premise- women with their own language and bond- is very promising."
1,"Awful, just awful","Trite, corny, unbelievable characters and storylines. Yuck. This terrible book was recomended to me in a bookstore as I was purchasing historical fiction. The ""alternate China"" is just a ruse to hide poor scholarship and writing. Truly the worst book I've read in the last couple of years."
2,I wanted my come-uppance,"This could have been a really fabulous book. But the flaws are so striking, it's really hard to forgive them. The biggest one being that one of the characters never gets her due. With all the drama that goes on in this book, the resolution, or lack thereof, is very unbalanced and disappointing.Also, it really freaks me out when I see statements like ""The best work of fiction yet..."" That's ridiculous. Especially in the case of this good, but again, deeply flawed book."
4,"Started out great, but....","The story was completely engrossing at the beginning, and I was hooked for about 300 pages. In fact, I searched to find other books this author had written because I wanted to read everthing she'd created. Then things started getting wierd in the book: characters would be introduced with such detail that they appeared to be main, or at least secondary, characters. Then they'd leave with little explaination.There were parts of the story that were extraordinary: the magic was incredible, the descriptions were poetic, and the characters came to life. The only thing that kept this book from being 5 stars, for me, was that I had to keep flipping back thinking ""who was this person again?"". That kind of ruined the momentum."
5,jab brings relief to todays radio pain!!!!!,"JAB - Custom Made is perhaps the most exciting and soulful debut records this year. Stop and listen ; close your eyes and wander through JAB. Songs like ""Sunburned"" , ""AM RADIO"" and ""Venice Girl"" are just some of the highlights that provoke intense listining passion. If you could melt Bob Dlyan, Pearl Jam, Neil Young and an artist so fresh there is no name... this is JABSTOP AND LISTEN."
5,Inspiration to go for it!,"I've looked at a lot of scholarship books, and this one is by far my favorite. There's a very helpful directory of scholarships. I found many scholarships that apply to me. But even more than that, this book motivated me to find scholarships and put my heart into applying. I've won $2,000 in scholarships so far and think I have a good chance at winning some more. The authors have a way of making it all seem do-able. If you want to be inspired to take some action, this is the book for you."
2,"Okay, but there are better","Free Cash for College is an okay resource, but there are definitely better books on the market. I find that ""How to Go to College Almost For Free"" by Ben Kaplan to be much more readable even though this book seems to have ripped-off a lot of the ideas from that one--I mean honestly, the ""Scholarship Myth"" idea seems to be outright lifted from the Kaplan one! Also, ""The Scholarship Book 2003"" is much more up to date than this one. If you're going to buy multiple books, don't get this one since it recycles a lot of ideas from other books that are written better."
5,Great starting point (also for Kabbalistic/Rabbinical reference),"On the surface you might think this is a simple compilation of Rabbis and Kabbalists. However, there are glimpses into their lives, and some of their profound thoughts. If there could be considered a starting point for Kabbalah, this will point you in the right direction. If anyone had a serious interest in Kabbalah and couldn't make it through this book, then they truly aren't ready for the rest."
2,"Competent text, but beware of a few downsides","Even though the textbook's content is well written and clear, there were several big downsides (for me).The first was that the text sometimes skips steps in the derivations, and simply presents the final solutions. This is fine if you simply want the end result. But, if you are interested in the fundamentals as well, you will be slightly disappointed.The second major drawback for me was the abysmal quality of the illustrations. All the illustrations are in black and white, and they are beyond plain. They appear to have been done in Microsoft Paint by someone with little passion for their work.For someone who is a visual learner, the illustrations might be a deal breaker when it comes to this text.Aside from that, the content is quite competently written."
3,Its okay,I'm not really impressed with the book. My professor doesn't really lecture from it so it was kind of a waste of money.
2,Mile Wide and an Inch Deep...,"Had to use this textbook for class; so to preface this review, I had a bad teacher which frustrated me along with the book.The book is weird. On some topics it goes way too in depth (enzymes) meanwhile on other things (organisms) it barely touches. To be honest this is a difficult topic to cover as this book attempts to teach all of Biotech Processing, but nonetheless they went about it awkwardly. Doesn't serve as a fantastic reference book, nor does it serve as a great high level overview. Not overly thrilled.Go Yellow Jackets!"
2,gets hot in microwave,The dishes get extremely hot in the microwave. A lot hotter than the food!. I purchased table settings of these dishes and like their design and appearance but can not touch them when taking out of the microwave after 2 minutes.
2,Lotus sMARTSUITE '96,I really needed Smartsuite 98 not 96. My bad !!\ '96 would not load files *.123 that I had on my backup.DaveSr
5,Modern classic from underrated author,"A good author who writes from experience is unbeatable. Petievich creates characters that may seem somewhat facile, but these are often young men who live between extremes: bureaucratic petty drudgery and high pressure situations. He draws you into the momentum of rash decisions and their disastrous consequences. Against the background of 80s L.A. captured with precision, the story is completely plausible. His prescient ""Earth Angels"" which presaged the Rampart scandal by nearly a decade is evidence enough that he has his nose in the wind. He may not have the gut wrenching character development of early Wambaugh, but his macro view of the good guys, the bad guys, and the undercurrent of political machinations is riveting. It's a crime that this book isn't a top seller... and it deviates from the flawed, yet excellent movie adaption to a degree where it's worth the read."
2,I found the story to be reasonbly interesting at first.,"The opening chapters held promise, but as the story went along I became particularly disappointed with the characters. The way that they interacted, the way that they developed, the way that the plot moved around them - it all left me cold. I expected a certain amount of ""negativity"" within the story, because it seemed appropriate. But the ending seemed to be not only negative, but also seemed to be not much of an ending. At least, it wasn't much of an ending for me. I was left feeling that nothing was really resolved."
1,This cover is fake,"I have been buying this cover three weeks ago, and this item is not a Body camera's Cap , It's a rear lens cap. If you want a Real camera cover , go to see Canon cameras dealer, it's price about $8 bucks."
4,Knitting on High,"I am having so much fun with this book. I had been looking for a little something to make as gifts for friends in my ""fiber circle"" ~ this covers them all! From weavers, to stitchers to spinners! Every angel is slightly different. I am sure that the recipiants of these little lace angels will be as charmed by them as I am."
5,A must have for lovers of lace knitting and or angels!,"I made 8 lace angels for Christmas gifts and wasn't disappointed in any of them. The book is well written and the directions for finishing easy to follow. Working with thread and dpns is not for a beginner but the knitting really isn't that difficult. I loved how easy it is to personalize each angel by using different charms or accessories. I found it easier to hot glue them together instead of sewing. Also included are patterns for two large tabletop angels. These are as beautiful if not more so than crocheted angels! I am so glad I bought this book, I plan to make more and next time will keep one for myself!"
5,Great background material to OSS,The 2 DVD's in this set contains a great collection of interviews giving background to the Open Software movement.Basic introductory level material for the person wanting to know more about the history.
5,"Classic, well-produced documentary on a topic of our age","Like it or not, hackers have been part of the profile of the computer age since its dawn. Mainstream non-insiders that don't code know little more about what programmers and hackers are thinking, formulating or from which perspective their reasoning comes. This documentary goes a far ways to bridge that gap and I felt very engaged while watching it. It's well produced (something I feel I can talk about with authority from having studied and from working within Video) does indeed incorporate a comfortable editorial logic and flow and includes well-photographed, well-cast, articulate and succint interviews that work with this documentary's focus. Bravo for the solid work."
3,boring,"This movie is mostly interviews about free software philosophy, open source philosophy, and the rise of linux in the business world. I found the film dull, and I am a linux geek. I do give it three stars because I can see where some may be entertained or informed by the discussions the interviewer had with Stallman, Torvalds, etc. My wife now better understands why I wear a tux hat :) I also enjoyed watching Stallman's manerisms and listening to him speak, since I've heard that he may have Asperger's Syndrome (as does my son, which is why that interested me)."
1,Preachy,"I am no fan of Microsoft, but this movie stinks, needs to be more documentary, less ranting interviews, tell us the history, the startup, the challenges etc......"
1,Dumb,"A stupid, propogandistic and self indulgant documentary about Richard Stallman and Eric Raymond. Linus is a good guy, but these other folks are just demagogues of the computer age. I particularly find their hacker interpretation of history insulting. It ignores all the hardworking professional engineers and programmers who really did invent computers and operating sytsems, and makes us think that scruffy hackers at MIT did anything that mattered."
2,2 Stars! Dissappointing Album from Funxsouljaz Member.,"I picked this CD up because I heard The Funxsouljaz on the Million Dollar Dream Double Album and dug their style and music. This is a solo project from Capital B of the Funxsouljaz but it is more of a compilation. They have a bee theme running in the art work - The Bumble - get it? Don't know what it has to do with the actual album. The beats on here aren't funky at all, with most being hum drum synth numbers. Lyrically none of the rappers really stand out on here - even Capital B sounds so-so out of the group element.I'd like to recommend it, but even for the price I do not think it is worth it to cop this. There are plenty of tighter Bay area compilations out there at this price point."
1,not great,not what i expected. thought i was buying the larger model. this sound is not even as good as some smaller speakers
3,Good for price but lacks portability,"I bought one these for me and one for my 12-year old niece. I wasn't happy with the portability. I thought it traveled, and was able to be played, as a tube but you have to unscrew the speakers, plug in the wires and make sure you have your USB cable to play your iPod. Too many steps. I returned mine and got the iBoom boombox player. It was more than twice the price but much better for what I wanted...just stick the iPod into the player...no cables needed. And it charges it too. My niece is seemingly happy with her Boomtube. It just sits on her dresser...basically just glorified speakers. I HIGHLY recommend purchasing an AC adapter though. It only comes with batteries."
2,Good sound but an important design flaw,"The ""A team"" designed the sound and the look of this set, but it was left to the ""B team"" to design the power supply! The battery compartment is fiddly with a tiny little lever just waiting to be broken off (then what??), and the on/off button engages too easily and there is no lock feature. I arrived in Africa all set to enjoy some good music but found dead batteries and a bunch of disappointed people (including ME!) I think this is a major flaw in something billed as ""portable"" -- I know I can remove the batteries to transport it, but why should I have to do that? Just one more thing to forget!"
3,"Virgin Boom Tube , (battery model)","I bought mine for $20 from FYE . It sounds pretty good , though it isnt really that loud. Nice because you can separate the speakers far apart to really notice stereo separation. Its supposed to have fairly good battery life but there is one important design flaw. When storing this unit in its storage pouch makes it very easy to accidentally turn on. It happened to me the first time i put it in the pouch. it should have a hold or a switch that is different. It would be nice if they offered a sleeve to fit over the unit to cover the switch when storing unit."
4,Virgin really knows quality,This speaker set made my Samsung MP3 sing loud and clear! This is a very well-made product!!!
4,Wonderful Production of an Award Winning Play!,"Very entertaining. Great performances, especially by Patti LaPone and Nicholas Surovy. WARNING: Chapter 14 has two quick instances of digital skip. These are on the master and are not a manufacturing defect. They are hardly noticeable and should not affect your enjoyment of this great play."
2,Time of your Life...Not while watching this DVD,I am sorry to say that I was very much let down when I first watched this DVD. I think that the story line is just boring. The fact that they filmed it without an audience makes it lose something. The only reason to own this DVD is if you are a huge Patti LuPone fan. But even she is not at her best here. I would pass this one up if I were you.
4,My hands are never cold anymore,I installed these and love them. I went hunting last year and the ride in sucked. hands and thumb cold. now problem fixed. easy to install and easy to use.
4,Great Product SymTec,Great Product [...] Really like quality and the response time thank you symtec you came through on this again. eated ATV Grips Features Include: Easy Installation Requires WD-40
2,not valid for todays declining realestate market,"a decent book with some good advice on making MORE money if you already have a few grand to start with. The bulk of the book however pushes realestate investment, and ""hitting them when they're down"" to gain properties cheaply. The section on stock market investing is also decent, but you need to have a a fair amount of money to start with to keep the transaction fees from eating you alive."
2,wealth 101,"...its a good book to read for inspiration. The best reading is the little tidbits of insight that are sprinkled throughout the text of the book(time management,financial planning,ect) I find,however,the real estate and stock market strategies mere filler and the book itself doubles as a catalogue for products and services. The book is definitely marketed to the ""get rich"" and ""seminar junkie"" crowds. I like the book for the information on what not to do and what one should do to be successful. I am not completely enamored of the investing and real estate strategies largely because I believe one should consult respected specialists in the various topics covered within the book.However,I believe the book alludes to this fact. Overall an entertaining read but the book is not worth the purchasing price new as is the case with most books of this genre. I give it 2 stars because the content therein may be of interest to the various markets mentioned above."
5,This is what it says it is,"This works as you'd expect, nothing crazy to note here. It's great if you run a small business or need to track mileage for your employer."
5,Just what we needed..,The mileage book is just what we needed for 3 different businesses that family runs. We have 4 different vehicles and it keeps us all accountable for our miles driven.
2,"Pay attention to the dimensions, you may be disappointed","Too small to write in... my accountant had given me a 9"" tall Journal a few years ago and it worked great with taller lines to write-in. This one is good if you want to carry it in your purse, but if you're leaving it in your Car glove-box, then why the heck is this made so small. Seems useless if you really want to write in it."
1,Doesn't work,"I was told that I snored more loudly than before when I used this pillow, so I would not recommend this pillow. I essentially wasted my money on this pillow."
2,Not good for sleep apnea,My dad has severe sleep apnea. I bought it to help him out even just a little. He slept on it for a night. He said it was really hard and my mom said it didn't help at all.I think this pillow is meant for people who snore because of less serious reasons.
2,Flattens out,"The first two nights with this pillow I liked it. My ears were sore because the foam is firm, but I slept well. After that, the front ridge that provides the support flattened out and stayed that way. I tried flipping the pillow around, but I didn't sleep as well. After one week I went back to my old pillow."
1,"Pillow too hard, only used once","I tried the pillow for one night and it was too hard. After a few hours I had to go back to my old pillow. It I can figure how to make it softer, I would be able to use it all night. If you like hard pillow you might be OK buying this item. Otherwise, I would not recommend it."
2,Did not help with snoring,"This pillow did not help to reduce my snoring, nor was it even comfortable. So it is useless for its intended purpose (as a snore stopper), and useless even for its secondary reason for existing (as a pillow)."
2,Didn't Really Work,"I bought this pillow for my husband, who only snores when he sleeps on his back. After placing the order, it arrived pretty quickly. We had to air out the pillow for a few days, because of the chemical smell. After that, it was fine. My husband tried the pillow for a few nights and I noticed that it only worked if his head was positioned correctly on the pillow. As soon as his head moved out of position, the snoring would start up again. It's very difficult to stay in one position when you're sleeping, so this pillow didn't really help. My husband said it wasn't very comfortable either, so in addition to it not helping, he stopped using it altogether. We ended up having him sleep on 2 stacked pillows to keep him on his side and that seems to be working much better."
1,WARNING! NO REFUNDS FOR THIS PILLOW!!!!,"I bought this pillow and it gave me the worst stiff neck ever. I went to return it and amazon informed me that it was unreturnable. Of course, the return information is only seen if you go through two links from the main page to get to it.Perhaps the pillow will work for you, but if it doesn't you're out of luck. Bad return policy. They did ship it quickly, though."
2,Don't bother,"Don't waste your time, and I mean a lot of time, replacing your metal OEM components with this plastic junk. I've done many radio installs in the past with no problems, but this deal with the integrated climate controls was a nightmare. The temperature control is the worst. The cable has to be in just the right position, and it will not entend far enough to install the cable befor snapping the panel in place. The instructions really blow."
1,Lack in Quality,"I bought this book and it lacks pages, important contents are missing. I don't know if this is the right thing or they just printed it by themselves."
3,Track listing,"* originally released 1981, MC Productions1. Flash Your Dread - Barrington Levy/Trinity2. Flash Your Dread (Version)3. All I Want For Christmas - Home T/Trinity4.

5,Basic Blues Magoos,"An outstanding re-issue complete with rare single released the following year, as bonus tracks. The last great Blues Magoos album. Great liner notes."
3,Decent Album,"It is a decent album. Better than ""Psychedelic Lollypop"" but still not that great. Altogether a mediocre listen. Has its moments, but not that great."
4,It's great,The Disney Fairytale Princess pull string Pinata is so much better than regular pinata's. The pull string is wonderful. All the kids are involved in opening the pinata so there isn't any upset kids about not being the one who broke it open. All the kids can grab a couple strings and pull.
5,Very interesting and informative.,Even with the 1960's production values this DVD is a great watch! A master of his craft operating at the top of his game. Not a how-to but a historical education in our early American craft industry.
4,It does what it says on the tin!,"There is something about each of Billy Childish's records which more than justify their continued existance within my record collection.So it is with this CD. Consisting of home recorded demos (which appear in various other forms elsewhere) the main attraction is the human quality of the recordings which often capture the feel of his solo live performances.The lofi quality shouldn't be a problem for someone with even the most casual appreciation of his music, in fact isn't that part of the attraction? The notes written by Billy on the back of the record sum it up perfectly..."
1,What Was He Thinking?!?,"As one of the progenitors of lo-fi DIY, Childish has not only scored some well-deserved respect for his no-frills, impassioned songwriting, but also helped propel the indie attitude and aesthetic significantly.Nonetheless, the man is not without his lapses in judgment. This collection of demos would not be the first time Childish peddles product no one in their right mind would touch (his 'poetry' books are a glaring example). Unless such scraps were one's own, they would be meaningless to anyone else: warbled echoes, mushed guitar sounds, 'acapella' song ideas whispered in the can, and mangled song bits of all sorts -- all this presented as the intimate musings of an 'artiste' at work. What drivel. That such garbage does not embarrass Childish is proof of the man's callousness -- the very trait he so much despises in the record industry.One thing is to make lo-fi music, quite another to release lo-fi demos of lo-fi songs. ..."
1,Fans of Lost Soul-STAY AWAY,"Usually when you see a CD of little known tunes from the classic era of R&B, you're in for some rare treasures. This is NOT one of those kinds of CD's. The tunes are almost to a one poorly recorded, poorly performed, and lacking in appealing hooks. This is one collection of lost soul that should have stayed lost."
3,It's not bad,"I bought this book for my Mt Whitney climb last month. The first four chapters cover history, getting to the mountain, food and clothing, etc. For myself, I could pretty much skip those chapters, more interested in the climb itself via the standard ""Whitney"" route and the ""mountaineers"" route. Only chapter five really covered that. And the chapters after that covered other routes (rock climbing) and nearby peaks. It's an ok guide. If I had to do over, I might purchase one of the other Mt Whitney books out there."
3,messy but fun,"I bought this for my girlfriend because she's an avid runner and has feet like rocks, but I don't think I spent enough money for it to be worth her while. The massage rollers at the bottom are really just two plastic spools with bumps on them that you have to roll your feet over manually (it's an awkward motion and doesn't feel that great). Even if the water is below the suggested level, the bubbles feature still splashes droplets outside the bowl. The heat feature doesn't keep the water warm unless it's scalding hot to begin with. The spray jets barely reach your toes, and feel just like they sound...like a jet of water hitting you in the big toe.Flashy and fun to take out, but not really much use as a foot spa."
1,Terrible product,"Terrible product:1. Water will not stay warm nor will it heat up2. The attachments will not stay... Attached3. During operation, water splashes out. Even with the water level below the recommended water level.This product was not worth what I paid. In fact, based upon the 3 issues mentioned it is not a bargin at any price.Buyer beware."
3,Room for improvement,Easy and fun to use. Water easily spill out if filled in too much water and no bubble jet if not enough water...kind of a stupid design. This is my first Foot Spa and probably also my last.
3,Disappointing Selections,Mlb certainly missed the boat on this collection. As two of the games on this set have already been released on other sets with the 1967 game on the impossible dream dvd and the game six on the 1975 World Series DVD. Their were certainly better choices overs the years for MLB to pick from that would've enhanced the experience for a Red Sox fan. Examples of this are The june 1977 Yankee game featuring Billy Martin pulling Reggie Jackson from the game and the altercation that soon followed. I understand why they wouldnt want to put the playoff on their from 1978. Another example of a game they could've put on their was the Derek Lowe no hitter or the Clay Buchholz no hitter from last year. Or for that matter any game except the 2004 ALCS featuring David Ortiz driving in a game winning run in their last at bat.
2,Red Sox DVD,"Was disappointed in this boxed set in that with the history of Fenway Park, so much was omitted! I expected it to be highlights, not entire, complete games! It did not include anything with the old-timers such as Ted Williams, Jim Rice, Carl Yazstremski, etc. Too little content for too much money. Save your $$$$."
1,It sucks to waste money,"I am not pleased with my product it came yesterday in a box without raping or any thing so that was a waste of 6 dollars in shipping and handling. Some of the wood looks old in the inside and the bamboo strings on the back of the bottom rack were out of place, the bottom rack looked worn out. I recommend you buy this product in a store so you can get one worth paying for. I just hope they send me my money back or a better product packaged well."
4,Very nice,"Nicely made, especially for the price. Lighter weight fleece, good for layering. Sizing is about right for the average large size. Nicely proportioned sleeve and body lengths. The fleece isn't all that stretchy, so if you want more room, try going to a larger size."
3,Very soft but tight,"This sweatshirt is very soft and warm, but the band along the bottom edge is waaaaay too tight!"
4,The price was right,"At the special low price, I couldn't resist getting a couple of these for family for Christmas. The sweat shirt material feels pretty solid and the size was right on."
2,It's one of the best guidance you could get,"I thought this book would turn out to be my hero.I was so confident, after learning all the strategies from this book.The result was that my score dropped by 3. Especially the science section? After I followed everythingit advised me to, my score dropped by 4. I guess everyone has their own styles of learning & strategies.don't copy from others; stick to your own."
4,The History of How it Came to Be,"Here it is... how Aquaman, The Flash, The Green Lantern, Black Canary, and the Martian Manhunter all met and decided to form one team ""The Justice League"". It covers their awkward ""getting to know you"" stage. Reconciling their public and private lives. Amd it also covers each of their origins. This isn't an action filled adventure. Some of it is slow. Much of it is not how we know these heroes now. This is how the heroes were twenty-something years ago. While reading it, I found myself missing Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and the others who are currently featured in the Justice League / JLA. But it gives a good historical background to grow on."
2,Justice Lame of America,"This was a fine attempt to tell a story that could have been good. The problem is that the writers don't tell us one NEW thing that fans of the Justice League need to know. Why not tell us how Black Canary manages to keep that blonde wig on? Instead of making details of the DC Universe more clear, the book actually creates more inconsistencies. Superman and Batman are so distanced from the league that it's hard to imagine them ever becoming involved. A half-hearted attempt to make Green Arrow a more important player is made but this branch of the story is left undeveloped. The most troubling problem has to do with the time period that the story does/does not take place in. Since so many of the revised versions of the league take place in contemporary periods then shouldn't that put this one about twenty or thirty years before other incarnations? If you're a fan you'll probably still buy it, but you'll feel a littled cheated. Don't say I didn't warn you!"
2,dont buy,Crap watch dont buy dor real its not that nice the.band is cheap and.feels light im.returning it the movement is crap u dont want japn movement u want Swiss movement
1,It only looks good.,"I bought this watch last year and was super happy with the price and how much it looks like a ROLEX Yachtmaster that i purchased another one to give my friend as gift. I only wore it maybe for 10x in 9 mos. since it's automatic, i was fine with adjusting it every time i have to use it, but last week, it stopped even while i was wearing it. i thought maybe i wasn't moving enough so i adjusted the time again. and it stopped again, and again, and again. what sucks the most is that i live overseas and i can't return it anymore.i like Invicta designs and their reasonable prices, but if a $90 watch can only last you 10 wears, then it's not such a good deal! it's like i rented it for $9 per day."
1,Why do I keep coming back to you?,"This will be the third time I am buying this watch. The first one broke within 2 months, Amazon replaced it, then I brought a second one, same exact model, and it broke again. The fact of the matter is it is not a $350+ watch, but it looks beautiful and often got mistaken for a gold Rolex Daytona watch. It is not really water resistant either. I am giving it another try because I can't find anything like it at this price. Sucker I am."
2,Gold Tone goes away,"I just receive this watch a couple of days ago and it works perfectly, but the third time a use it, I started to notice that the gold tone of the band was changing to a less bright and like a white color. The bezel is ok and everything is okay, but the band is the problem, it can not maintain the original gold tone and that's very disappointing. Now you can see the contrast between the bezel and the band and does not have a week of use."
1,worse spam i ever seen,"spam. not even worth the discount price. probably rubbish from china. the timer lose go to slow. lose 15 minutes every day. and sometimes stop. dont buy anything from invicta, is my advise. i bought 3 clocks now. all are rubbish,probably thats why they try to sellout. spam"
4,The best Greatest Hits for the casual fan,"I am only a casual fan of Type O Negative, that is I like only the hits (I must admit) and this is the best choice for that. Avoid the later ""Greatest Hits"" album that came out as it certainly offers nothing new and is on the cheap. My only lament is that it a cringe-worthy version of ""Hey Joe"" is here and not the sorely lacking gothic cover of ""Summer Breeze"" otherwise all the known songs are here for those that just want a sampling."
4,Type O Negative - The Least Worst Of,"This was marketed as a best of album, but it really isn't in the true sense of it all, in fact, it's more a collection of B-Sides and Rarities than anything. Different versions, remixes, edits and compilation appearances make up the majority of this CD, so while it is not a true ""Best Of"", it is a nice little addition to the completist's library. While I don't feel that some of the versions are nearly as good as the originals, it is still kind of nice to a different take on an old favorite. This CD should definitely not be used to get into the band, as it is not a good representation of their career, it is however a nice collection of unreleased and tough to find stuff. Recommended to fans."
5,Very good!,This CD is definitely worth the ... The only bad thing about it is Black No.1 isn't even worth listening to because they cut out around 7 minutes of the song and it is also censored. The new songs on it are great.. Out of the new ones I would say Stay Out of My Dreams and 12 Black Rainbows are the best. Get this CD!
4,Almost 5 stars,"The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the shortened versions ruin their best songs. Seriously, shortening a 12 minute song down to 5 minutes makes me glad I have the CD that the original one is on. However, I definately recommend this, both for newcomers to the band as well as Type O fanatics like myself. The new songs are pretty good. My favorites on THIS CD (not the full versions on previous CDs) would have to be ""Hey Pete"", ""It's never enough"", ""Stay out of my dreams"" and ""Cinnamon Girl."" Don't get me wrong, the other songs are among their best, but the fact they were shortened ruins them in my opinion."
3,could have been so much better,"The music is of course excellent and it looks to me like the some lay out is excellent, so i bought it thinking that this was a good way to hear most of my favorite type o songs without changing CDs. then i poped it in and was slapped in the face with horribly different versions of songs many of them much shorter. i would imagine that most of the people who are looking at this collection have at least a couple type o cds or ast least know a couple people who do, so my advice to you is to take the songs that you love and build your own ""greatest hits"""
5,Possibly one of the best bands out there today,"Want else can I say but amazing. It would have been four stars because the songs are shortened, but then I listened to ""Stay out of My Dreams"". That put the band back up to 5 stars. I have already been asked by many people to borrow the cd because they wanted to hear why a band I like so much could be so enthralling. Perfect for anyone wanting to hear real music and not this test-tube 12 year old dance music."
2,Just get Bloody Kisses,"Although I enjoy Type O Negative's music, I really don't think this is the best introduction to their work. The edits of ""Christian Woman"" and ""Black no. 1"" completely butcher both of those classic songs from their best album, Bloody Kisses. As a matter of fact, the only listenable songs on here are the edit and remixes of songs off October Rust, plus the new cut ""12 Black Rainbows."" If you're new to Type O, get either of the albums mentioned above, but definatly stay away from this God-aweful compilation!"
5,The perfect greatest hits album!,"Although I would have rather seen a new studio album (which is planned for October 2001, The Least Worst is still a great record. The new tunes ""Its Never Enough"" and ""Stay Out of My Dreams"" are probably two of the best tunes that the band have written in years. If you are already a fan of TON, get this record for the new songs. If you are new to the band, this will give you a good overview of their style."
5,A superb collection,"This CD is worth buying just for the two new tracks ""Its Never Enough"" and ""Stay Out of My Dreams"" (if they were on World Coming Down, they would have been the best tracks!!!). A terrific collection of b-sides, covers, remixes & edits. Buy this now!"
4,Respect from a non metal music connosisseur,"If you're a casual TON listener like me, then this should be right up your ally. The basic TON essentials are here with titles such as ""Black No.1"" ""Love You To Death"" ""Christian Woman"" and ""Everyone I Know is Dead. I'm not a big metal person but there's something about TON's music that keeps me listening. I think the fact that I've keept them in heavy rotation for so long says something about how good they really are. Maybe it's their gothic mystique or Peter Steele's voice that keeps me coming back. earthier way, they've withstood the test of time. If you're just getting into TON I would pick this album up first. It's not really an album, more of a collection....anyway, this is a great introduction to TON to get a soild feel for what they offer. give it a spin!"
5,strapped for cash?go with this.,"get this great retrospective of one of the top 10 bands of the 90's.you'll just end up getting all the cd's anyway like me,but what-the-hell."
4,Unsuccessfully Coping With the Natural Beauty of Pete Steele,"This collection of b-sides, rare tracks, remixes and previously-unreleased tracks showcases TON not at their best, but at their most versatile.Theres the long, dark, gothic tracks like ""Black Sabbath....."" and ""Never enough"" and the more accessible tracks like ""Christian Woman"" ""12 black rainbows"" and ""Black No. 1"". Then theres wierder ones, like ""hey, Pete"" and ""My Girlfriend's Girlfriend"". Unfortunately, not all the mixes work (i prefer the full version of 'Everything Dies', for example), and so this album only gets 4 stars from me.Because of its wide range of tracks, this album is a great buy for new fans looking for a good introduction to Pete Steele and Co., and the rare and unreleased tracks make it a good choice for established fans as well. More casual fans might prefer October Rust or World Coming Down instead, though."
4,"Nice quality book, usefull info","Very well presented book, with good quality photos and its very informative about all the aspects of snake life : reproduction and evolution of a snake is all covered here. Very good book for snake lovers or just someone that is curious about snakes."
3,Book about SNAKES !!!,"I purchased this book for my 3-year-old great-nephew, who seems to be ""obsessed"" with snakes. The pictures are very colorful, but there are just not very many in this book. Then again, for the price, I suppose the publisher cannot print very many full-color full-page pictures. Probably, next time, I'd choose a book that would have more pictures."
5,Many Styles for older Celtic Hymns,"One of my favorite Irish Angelic Mystical sopranos, Joanna Hogg of Iona singing from ancient traditional & modern contemporary Celtic Christian Hymnals with modern production in honor of her Father Rev. Sam Moles. This is the best I heard her sing in years, maybe because with Iona she has to project through all the electronic back up instruments. All the band of Iona is here, including alumni Nick Beggs, Teri Bryant, & David Fitzgerald with The Emperor String Quartet. The Quartet is amazing; modern Classical music that fits the mood rather than just the back up chords of the hymns. Joanna plays the piano with sweeping spirituality that matches the Quartet. All back up music is top notch with Celtic flare specially the guitar work of Dave Bainbridge & the pipes of Troy Donockley. I sing a lot of these hymns at my church & it's great to hear them professionally in a new light."
4,Something a little different,"Joanna has a nice voice and the arrangements are pretty. This is cd is calm and soothing and I enjoy listenting to it while I go to sleep. Some of the arrangements a little on the slow side, but that makes it great for bedtime music. It's not as peppy as most of the Celtic Hymns cd's out there, but it is genuinely Irish and well done. It makes a great addition to my collection and I would buy it again if I were to lose or break it."
4,good book if you like nuclear fantasy,good from the stand point of what the world would be like after a nuclear war but has the fantasy mixed in to make you realize that it would not happen that way..still a very good book though.
4,"Great Band, much better than just Precious And Few","I was happy to see one of my favorite old bands on CD finally. I wish that someone would release it all! Although in mono for the most part 8 of the 12 cuts are from the album (a short instrumental passage before Picnic in the Rain is the 8th cut) 3 cuts are previously unheard. First, Park Preserve which was the b-side to Precious and few is lengthened to over 5 minutes on this cd. The song Rock and roll heaven which was a hit for the Righteous Brothers is here in its ORIGINAL version. Yes, a member of Climax wrote it. Finally Waiting for the end to come is a pretty good mid tempo pop song. There is another cd out there on ebay occasionally with 8 different songs and the 7 album cuts here. 7 of those 8 are not from the album and it still leaves around 5-6 cuts still unreleased. This cd is definately worth a listen, but i wish Rhino or someone would release an anthology of everything. (all 25-28 cuts they recorded)"
1,Deceptive picture for a poor functioning product -- stay away,"I am so disappointed at this product that I feel compelled to write my first review on Amazon. First, the product does not work. It turns only with a lot of force exerted, and that is unloaded. This is certainly not rated for up to 75lb of load as claimed. Second, the picture of the product is extremely deceptive. The product is only the oval disk, and does NOT include the glass stand underneath. There is a disclaimer about the glass stand not being included, but that's INSIDE the box. Needless to say, I sent it back for refund. Didn't even want to risk a replacement."
5,great for utility knives,i use this shapener to keep a sharp edge on my utility knife. i install drop ceiling and cutting ceiling tile dulls the blade pretty quickly. this sharpener quickly sharpens the blade and is very small and light and just stays in my tool pouch.
5,"Fantastic, the best yet","This book is so good that my fiance and I read it cross atlantic. Me in London, him in Miami. Written for an intelligent audience it doesn't talk down to you. Love the clear and easy to use lay-out. Talks about hot topics in a succinct but complete manner.Targeted at both Marriage preparation as well as for Marriage enrichment. We have started to use this book for reference.Invaluable!"
3,"Good subject, poorly written","Connor does a fabulous job of making Kepler's world fascinating. This provides an excellent account of living during the counter-reformation, which I had little knowledge of beforehand. He also does a great job analysing Kepler's thoughts and placing them in historical context. However, the book is poorly written because he uses tonnes of inappropriate metaphors, uses sentence fragments, as well as organisational issues. Most of these show up in the last half of the book and it appears as if the editor ran out of steam half way through. It is definitely worth reading but a second edition could improve it greatly."
5,Capture the Essence,"Loving Your Child captures the essence of how to bring ministry to motherhood. Its warmth, charm, and depth of insight make it invaluable to mothers, grandmothers, teachers, young women hoping to become mothers, and anyone who comes in contact with children. To benefit the most from this book, don't rapid read! Take it and meditate on the principles and be ready to activate any necessary changes these pages will compel you to make. By the way, hand the book to your husband. He will be enriched by reading it, as well."
4,More for exam!,"It is very excellent book for your surgery rotation exam, especialy of you have limited time, But not very usful to be use in round as it is written on its cover!!"
2,Not very tasty,"I'm Jewish and I'm from Texas so, I should like this book, right? WRONG! None of these characters is likeable and that includes Ruby, the Rabbi's wife. Since she's the character at the center of this story, that makes it difficult. She's nosy, pushy, snide, and sneaky. That's just SOME of her good qualities. Her friends are even worse. The ""mystery"" is far-fetched. The blurb on the book's cover is very appealing. It's a shame the book isn't as good as its cover."
4,Good for the money!,"When I went to buy the headphones from Amazon, the price increased from $38.99 to $55 overnight! Too much for me. I went through new egg and the shipped price was $45. Then Amazon lowers the price again to $39 & free ship! darn! it figures!Anyway, my review on the headphones is that they are good and well worth the $40. Don't hesitate to buy these but don't get your hopes too high. There are a lot of 5 star reviews on these headphones which I think are too high. 5 stars should mean the Ritz-Carlton of Headphones and these are not they. Kind of like when you hear too many good things about a movie and when finally you see it, it turns out to be just a decent movie but not an Oscar winner. Same deal here. I gave 4 stars b/c of the nice price."
2,cheap but cheap,The sound quality and design is better than what you might expect for that price yet my pair got a disconnection on the cord near the jack after a month. I cannot use it anymore so I don't think it is the right product if you are going to use it while traveling.prosgood design (I find it quite easy to put it into its nice case)good priceconstoo fragile
3,"Good Headphones, Lousy case!","The SENNHEISER PX100W White Headphones, sound good, look good, and feel great! For the price I would buy them again. I use them with my IPOD, and they definitly increased my listening experience. The only kicker is; Good Luck putting them back in the case! You need to plan for about 45 minutes to get them in correctly for at least the first 6 months. I stopped using the case after about the 2nd month."
4,"Decent Headphones, Slightly Muffled Sound","the build quality and comfort of these headphones are better than the koss porta-pro, but i find the sound to be a bit muffled. even so, the px100 have a more balanced frequency response and may be better certain types of vocal music. for electronic, pop, or rock music i prefer the porta-pros for their sharper higher frequencies and more impactful bass."
4,Rock solid,"I bought these phones to replace the awful earbuds that came with my iPod. The PX100W is well designed, comfortable to wear, folds up neatly and easily, and the sound quality is very good. They're ideal for relatively loud environments like on the subway, but I would not recommend them for an office or lab, nor for home unless you live alone, because their open design means that anyone nearby is going to hear everything that you hear. My wife certainly won't put up with ""that noise"", so I use the closed version of these phones (the Sennheiser PX200W) at home instead.Overall I'd rate them a good value and a good companion for you iPod."
4,good sound and comfortable,"These headphones are very comfortable and have good sound quality. Much better than the earbuds, which don't stay in my ears. It takes a few trys to figure out the folding sequence when putting them in the case."
5,Super portable headphones,"What can I tell you? Loaned my first set to my daughter and she refused to part with them. Got a second set right away. Outstanding sound quality. Durable. Very light weight. Comfortable on my head for hours. I couldn't stand using earbuds, so I tried this. Superior to earbuds in every way.If you need more information than this to make a decision, I can't help you."
2,Muddy highs and mids,"I don't get all the great reviews. I purchased based upon the reviews and have been disappointed. My Apple ear buds sound better, I think. Other people that have tried them and think they are great. They are comfortable and could be worn for hours but too much sound is missing for me. By the by, I have excellent hearing. Think I'll try something else. Thanks Amazon."
5,AWESOME,"I bought these on the recommendation of a friend, and was amazed at how good they are.I would find myself hearing things I had never heard before, and even figuring out words to songs that had baffled me for years. That's saying a lot. I love how they fold up and the travel case they come in. I have taken them along on flights, and compared to the typical ear buds most people use, they are amazing, with real bass."
4,"Good product, and beautiful","All I want to say is that this is a good product. Looks beautiful. And the sound quality if just fine.If you want to enjoy some Hi-Fi music, this might not be your choice. It is good for the music playing on a pc or a mp3. And if you travel a lot, this product should absolutely be the only choice."
4,"Rumors on the bass are exaggerated, but prepare for others to hear","These headphones are great for listening to your MP3 player or computer. They are easy to fold up (instructions actually on the headphones) and transport. For the average user, I believe you will find the sound experience quite satisfactory. I would have given it 5 stars if there was not so much of your listening experience shared with those around you. Be prepared that most people around you are going to hear what you hear unless you have the volume pretty low."
3,Let-down...,"Schreier is one of my favourites. I was not sure what to expect of Richter as an accompanist but since I can't stand Andras Schiff (the accompanist in Schreier's other Winterreise recording) my hopes here were high. Unfortunately, the performance is weak... Terribly slow at times, word-stress disturbing and not effective, voice shrill and unpleasant without this being used in a positive way."
2,almost useless and it hurts,"Take my advice on this folks, dont go cheep on a nose hair trimmer. The blade is to far recessed into the unit to trim hair short. You can't trim closer then maby 2-3 mm. This makes it somewhat useless. It also either has to slow a motor, or dull blades cause it hurts like hell to use it. Go with the sharper immage trimmer. I had mine for years, till the kids broke it, but I will be buying another soon."
3,I've had better,"This is the second Panasonic nose hair trimmer I've owned, and sadly I prefer the first. Don't know the model number of the first one I bought, but it was black and silver and although it wore out very quickly it did a better job of cutting hair than this new model."
3,"Does what it's supposed to, but...","What else is there to say about it? It trims your nose and ear hair. My only problem with it is that although it does trim the hair, its pretty useless when it comes to catching hair. You'll end up with a nose/ear full of hair. I haven't had any other problems with it yet. Like the saying goes, you get what you pay for."
1,Waste of Money,"After 3 months and approximately 10 uses, the motor in the Trimmer stopped working. When it did work, it cut only adequately with occasional pulls. Try another brand name."
3,A good start but needs work,"Hopefully, the new edition coming this Fall will be improved (the Production Notes need more data from more collectors to be more accurate). The 1997 Reunion Exclusive Piece listed on page 300 is wrong, it was #604 New Point Loma, not Rose Island. To the reader from Long Island who posted the only other review of this book (on 7/30/99), the reason the Old Field Point piece does not have the skeletal tree seen in the picture is because HL had production/shipping problems with the brittle limbs so they replaced it with a more sturdy evergreen, still a wonderful piece!"
3,"Student? Buy used, save money!",I bought it because I had no choise. I saved some money in Yahoo. That is all.
5,"Great Ceramic pad, great price!!!","After doing some shopping around I found the best bang for the buck for this Pad was from Amazon. Overall the pads fit well, did not need the normal break-in that other pads do (upon my resurfaced rotors) & seated well. I find both the cold & hot stopping ability of these brakes on my 300M to be far superior to the prior ceramics which left me dis-""Satisfied""."
4,"Repping da Magnolia, but nuttin compared to 400 Degreez!!!","This cd was Ah-ight. It's a decent debut for a superstar rapper from New Orleans, home of da Magnolia! There are only 4 tracks that were really Bumpin (#2,3,8,11)! The other tracks are a bunch of Filler Songs w/ Weak beats. I recommend you stick to 400 Degreez before you start thinkin bout copping this joint! To me, Juvenile's Best Work (lyrically and production-wise) is with his 400 Degreez album. That cd so far has been the HOTTEST album out of the Cash Money Clique! Hopefully, this review helps. Peace in the Mideast! (P.S.-The Hot Boyz need to reunite and collaborate on a Bangin album for 2003!)"
2,It was aight its not tight like 400 degreez,I liked it a lil bit. It could of been a lot better. I liked 400 degreez better. Juvenile is tight as hell but this was kinda booty!
3,soulja rags,"well, soulja rags was alright.He had alot of songs on there where he was talking about more than money. I like ""who's the mutha f*****"", and ""soulja rags"".I wouldnt recomend buying this album unless you just miss Juvenile."
5,NOTHING BUT THE BEST!,"THIS CD IS WHAT YOU CALL HOT! THE TRACKS, THE CONCEPTS, AND JUVENILE'S FLOW ARE BRILLIANT. IT IS SO HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THIS ALBUM WAS PUT TOGETHER BEFORE CMR SIGNED WITH UNIVERSAL. IT WAS WORLD WIDE MATERIAL BEFORE IT WAS ACTUALLY WORLD WIDE."
3,New Marvel team of heroes,This trade paperback collects the first six issues of Marvel's 2006 Young Avengers series. OC and Grey's Anatomy writer Allan Heinberg and Marvel's 'Young Gun' artist Jim Cheung introduce a new team of super-powered teenagers that each resemble a charter member of the Avengers.I enjoyed the inclusion of supervillian Kang The Conqueror and other references to early Avengers comics. Unfortunately the promising beginning slips into an awkward time-travel plot with a deux ex machina ending. I'd rate this volume worthy of 3-1/2 stars but still enjoyed it enough to read Volume 2 (which I liked more).
5,Not The Tean Titans You'd Expect,"The Young Avengers is definetly one of the best comics around. Not only is the writing jus great, but also the art is good too. Also, The Young Avengers are not exactly the carbon-copies that they look like. Asardian (""young Thor"") is actually a warlock. Hulkling is a shape-changer. Iron Lad is actually a young Kang. Patrot has the best story of all and actually hates Captain America. Each character has a highly developed back story. It is definetl a great read. Get this book!"
1,Don't Buy!! Takes on Water!!,"I bought this ""dive"" watch which is rated water resistant up to 100 meters (330 feet). In a pool in no more than 10 feet of water, it took on water. I bought this from WatchZone through Amazon and they refuse to issue a refund or replacement.I recommend the Citizen's Ladies Professional Dive watch which is available through Amazon for $165. It is similar in looks to this watch and is eco-drive which means it never needs a battery! It is rated for 300m or 990ft. Spend a little extra and get a good watch that will last for years and years!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"I have been buying freestyle watches for 17 years. I bought this last one while I was deployed to Iraq and after only about a month, one of the quarter-hour markers came loose and started to rattle around in the face. It periodically got stuck under the second hand and stopped the watch. I finally got bakc to the states and took it in to get that piece fixed and a new battery. This was about a week ago. THIS MORNING, two more of the little 5 minute markers fell off. I paid sixty bucks for this piece of crap. Save your money and get something that will last longer than a month."
3,Shark X vs Shark X Mid,"I ordered the Freestyle Shark X MID- what I received was the regular Frestyle Shark X. The reason I wanted the Mid is that it was supposed to be smaller, and as I feared- the regular one was Ginormous. There was no problem sending it back, except on the phone when I was explaining the issue, I could tell they still had no idea they did not send the correct item. The receipt said Shark X Mid, but the tag on item was not the Mid.They just thought I didn't like it, so instead of getting the Mid sent out, I just returned it. Too bad, I am sure it would have been what I wanted. Received prompt service, and credit on my card."
1,"I wish I could review this, but ....","I ordered this watch, and got my package on time. But when I opened my package, it was the wrong watch. So, it wasn't a bad watch that I got, but not the one I wanted. I'll probably be buying the Baby-G from Casio since that's what I was going to buy first before I purchased this one."
1,horrible,This is the worst product ever. the push button for the led almost never responds and if you push it to firmly it sticks within the unit... The magnifier offers little visibility due to the poor attempt in making it appear to be convex! It gets worse... never put it in your wallet!!! The lens is too easily scratched. And it 's not like I got a bad one... I ordered 2!
1,"Good idea, but bad execution!","I am having trouble reading menus at restaurants, so when I saw this little gadget I thought it would be perfect.Something that I can fit into my wallet and be there when I need it. I thought it was such a good idea I bought three of them, one for me and the other two for a couple of friends with the same problem.Owl was a disappointment. This magnifier produces very dim light, it lights a very small area. The magnifier is not of a high quality and combined with the dimness of the light it becomes very hard to use. Imagine reading a menu one word at a time. You need to constantly move the magnifier around. It was rather tedious. But I could have lived with it when I was desperate. However, after a few uses the light totally died.When I checked with my friends on their Owls... and they had the same problems!Good idea, but bad execution!"
4,Owl Light and Magnifier,"Satisfied with product. Would like it better if light were stronger and covered a wider area, but, overall, it works amazingly well for something so small and simple."
3,COOL,REALISTICALLY COOL BUT DOESN'T HOLD UP TO DASHBOARD HEAT. AND WE LIVE IN UPSTATE NEW YORK. THE LEGS MELTED RIGHT OFF THE STAND. IT WAS FUN WHILE IT LASTED!
5,Has there been a more persuasive interpreter of Schnittke?,"These are amazingly persuasive performances of Schnittke's music due in no small part to the combination of Kremer's astonishing virtuosity, his powers as an interpreter, and his passion for this music. Other performances (Lubotsky, for example, or Ambartsumian [in the Third Concerto]) are adequate to good, but Kremer easily edges out these rival versions. In fact, if you've been underwhelmed by the pieces before, this set will turn you around."
5,Essential Set of Schnittke's Music.,"In this well laid out album you get a distinct timeline of the development of Alfred Schnittke. Starting from the first concerto (written while a student in 1957 and revised in 1966) to his last concerto written in 1984 Schnittke's development is interesting to follow. The performances are all first rate. Played by Gidon Kremer and the accompaniments are superb especially in the second concerto with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe and the fourth concerto with the NDR Symphony Orchestra of Hamburg.The album is very well laid out with no concerto being fragmented on two discs. The album also has very good liner notes with biographical information of Schnittke, Schnittke himself discussing his concertos, and the violinist Gidon Kremer discussing Schnittke. I would highly recommend getting this disc."
4,Only the 4th vc is Alfred at his best,"Hutchingson's review is accurate on the 1st vc, as Alfred explains in the notes. The 2nd and 3rd do not seem to offer all the exceptional composing i know from many other Schnittke works.All his concerto grosso are outstanding. But here in this set, really only the 4th is where Alfred is shown as the musical genius he is.Here in the 4th the atonal mastery is broght in contrast to melodyic lines. Creating a fabric of astonishing musical canvass that enchant and enthrall.This set if really for devoted Schnittke fans only.I see its now OOP and only 1 copy remains at $75.I'd wait , as it should see re-release.I give Kremer/Eschenbach 5 Stars, and the 3 orchestras 5 stars.The 4th vc is graet and deserves 5 Stars. But alas, i can't whole heartily give 5 stars, for only 2 or the 4 vc's recommended.I would say the 3rd has its moments on I'd give that vc a 4 Star rating. Read all my Schnittkle reviews. Look especially at his Peer Gynt."
2,Smells bad,This thing makes my room smell like a petting zoo. But it fits great and it is comfortable. Hopefully the smell wears off or can be washed off.
2,Live music is never as good,IMO live music is never as good as the studio mixed. I shouldn't have bought this.
4,Muscle tone,"I've been using this product for several years. It appears to help me maintain muscle tone, as I continue to be very active in sports and strength training."
2,Looks really cheap,"""Now"" seems to a really low quality brand. its cheaper but you would be better off paying $3-4 extra and get something like ON or muscletech."
1,Another film of tired sterotypes........,"I can not belive a film like this was made. The writing was horrible and all of the characters fall into the the most blatant sterotypes. Gun hating libs will love this movie because it portrays EVERY gun owner as a loser, criminal or loaner. It is a dishonest movie...PERIOD. I hated it and I wish HOLLYWOOD would have the guts to make a movie about gun owners without falling back on the tired, untrue sterotypes."
5,Excellent Programs,"This second season is even better than the first, I love the way the characters are deepening without the cloying sentimentality that bogs down some crime shows. Wonderful storylines and flawed but realistic characters make this season a must see."
4,what is wrong with C.B.S.?,"first of all C.S.I. is a great show and this season's offering is just as wonderful as any thing on tv now or ever, this is why i gave it 5 stars.However i had to take one away from it because for some strange reason C.B.S. has decided to ignore a large portion of it's audience. there is no captions on this set none my wife is slightly hearing impaired and the captions help keep the volume level at listenable level for me while she watches. how can any studio put out a DVD or movie in any format without captions? how, in this day and age can this happen? how can we let this happen?so if you are hearing impaired or know someone who is, don't buy this set or anything else from C.B.S. till they fix this horrible problem."
5,love csi ;),LOVE CSI. great series. highly recommend. gets ya thinking. its really interesting. i love it! all the episodes are great!
5,csi,its a great dvd incredible price arrived when they said it would.....looking forward to buying the next seasons very soon
5,i love it i love it i love it,"I received it in very good condition. A view days earlier than i was expected. I enjoy it very mutch and will definetly orderthe next series, and the next. I also will never look at it the same way after the intruduction. There goes very hard workinto every episode. Thank you!"
5,I can't wait!!!!!!,I can't wait to buy CSI second season. I enjoyed watching the entire first season...this is one show in which repeats aren't a problem! It was a great surprise to check ... and see that this next set of DVDs will be offered in September...here's to the 3rd season DVD set and hopefully many more.
4,CSI comments by a reader,CSI has excellent writers and actors. Unfortunately my copy of this season came with a few flaws that hung up the video. Hope for better products in the future.
5,THis has worked great for a media center setup,"This service works great for a connected media center setup. You get DVD playback... Thursday nights we are recording 3 other shows at the same time, and just go ahead and DL this one."
4,crime scene techno with a twist,"most of the stories in crime screne are very good, and the writers and producers have gone to great lenghths to make it look real and professional, very entertaining and enlightening on the process of crime scenes. real cop's can pick this apart,put we are looking at the entertainment plus...science rolled into one..."
4,Always a good show,"This has always been a good show, but as time has gone by it has become better. This season is one of my favorites."
1,BS! Widescreen!,"First off I love the show don't get me wrong, but when the second season was on television it was never in widescreen! That's why I rated the box set itself a 1 star. The show is great. Why do company's do this and end up ruining a great show. I really don't care what anybody else has to say about that they love it because it's in widescreen. WIDESCREEN SUCKS! If you want to see widescreen go to the movies.Was this review helpful yes/no"
4,CSI,"This is the second time I am purchasing things from Amazon. I know their quality, in serving people. The CSI used DVD which I bought through Amazon are really good and looks like a newly purchased one. There are no scratches, either on DVD's or on the case. Thanks to Amazon, I am planning to buy more DVD's form them. It is worth buying this type of DVD's - help students to solve criminal problems.A suggestion to Forensic Science teachers, use them according to the grade level."
5,great,those cornsilk powders are the best i have founded to keep shine in control. nothing else works like this. just the best for mixed or oily skin.
4,very good clamp -- but,"Like all Bessey heavy duty clamps I'm aware of, this one does a great job of high pressure clamping. It is very sturdy and therefore heavy. I just wish it came with a protective tab at the fixed end."
5,Lighthouses: A Photographic Portfolio book,It added a lot to my collection of lighthouse portfolio books It has become one of my favorites--abosllutely love it.
4,A Fun & Festive Yuletide Collection,"I have owned this on cassette for about 10 years now & I still enjoy playing it; starting in October when I get out my carton of Christmas music. Most of the tunes here are enjoyable, but my all-time favorite is Shawn Colvin's version of Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas-what a beautiful voice! This is really an electic mix of songs, something for everyone. Highly recommended."
3,Acoustic Christmas Music with a Country feel,"This album was a bit of a disappointment, mostly because I was expecting something else. I anticipated Christmas music performed by an acoustic jazz instrumental combo; however, the nature of the instruments and the intonation of the singers gave the album a definite country feel. It was not at all bad, it was just not what I was expecting. Sort of the Christmas music one might find at a roadhouse in the outskirts. If you like a smooth country take on your Christmas music, this album would be great."
3,Good condition,Got the book in excellent condition but haven't had a chance to read much of it. But it came in fast and like I said is in great shape and I'm hoping to dive into it more fully soon.
3,Buy the BOXED SET (or not ?),"It's not an in-depth video but the mood is fine. This is One of a 3-item boxed-set which I can highly recommend. However, it'sinteresting to know that The Big Five item is also available on DVD in South Africa!"
2,Just another zone diet,"I bought this for my mother who is getting into healthy living and here is what she said...""Was not impressed with the book, it was just another zone diet and the zone diet made me sick."""
4,Not what I expected...,"I purchased this toy for our daughter because she loves to play with her other toy balls so much. She also loves to put things in and take things out so I thought this would be a great combo with the balls and the bag. The bag is just a little too little. It is hard for her to get the balls in and out because the bag is only JUST big enough to fit all four balls in it. Also, the flap on the bag secures with three different velcro tabs which makes it difficult for her to open. Maybe with use the velcro will become less sticky. I had read other reviews that the soccor ball makes the cutest boing sound. I guess I would consider it more of and interesting sound than a cute sound. You also have to throw the ball against something to get it to make the boing noise despite the instructions saying ""squeese me"". But, all in all I think it is cute and she has enjoyed playing with it so far."
2,There's a more reasonable package of the same material!,"I like Bear Family a lot, but unless you really really want to have 2 CDs full of outtakes you're much better off getting the JSP release, ""All The Classic Releases 1937-1949"". Rejected alternate takes aside, this Bear Family set includes only 4 tracks that are not included in the JSP set: 'I'll Have A New Life', 'Come Back To Me In My Dreams', 'Why Did You Wander', and 'Shining Path'. Other than that, the tracklisting is exactly the same and in the same order. The big difference between the 2 sets is the price tag (as of the time of this writing); $200 for the Bear Family set and $30 for the JSP set."
3,A Diverse Piece Of Work,"This is a pretty nice piece of diverse work by MC Overlord. I think it was done at a time when he was still trying to define his sound, but he delivers some pretty inspiring work despite."
3,Finally a book about PJ!,"Unfortunately, this book is spotty.The early stuff seems well-researched. Perhaps the people she associated with then are not famous so they're more likely to tell all those cool stories. Perhaps famous people are tight-lipped, hoping for the same treatment. I'm just guessing, though, I have no idea.The really interesting stuff (and a much bigger proportion) covers her early career (before and during the Dry period). After that, it seems mostly written from interviews and magazine articles.I was thrilled with the chapters on the early stuff, but by mid-way this thing ran out of gas. If the author could've kept it up this would be a 5 star. Peace."
2,Taschen 25 edition is 100 pages shorter than 1999 edition,"I borrowed the 1999 edition of this book from the library and absolutely loved all 340+ pages of it. I was extremely disappointed to discover that this book is 100 pages shorter. There are fewer sites covered, and the sites that are covered are shown in less detail. I suppose if I had never seen the original book, I might think this book was adequate. Save your money and get a copy of the original edition. And beware of Taschen 25 editions -- I also bought a copy Modernism Rediscovered, only to discover that it is 160 pages shorter than the original. How would anyone know this, when the books have the same titles, authors and publisher as the original editions -- just a lot fewer pages."
4,Good but fix the picture!!!,"The product does exactly as billed. Smarthome is great and fast. The only problem is that the picture on Amazon.com depicting the product is wrong. This is a plug in item, through which you plug in other items. It is not a switch as shown."
2,OK for impact protection but what about the sensitive screen?,"Great for protecting the Motorola Q from the impact of the occasional drop on the floor, but somehow the ""coolness"" factor of the Q is lost as this protective skin makes the phone look rather cheap and almost like a child's toy.The sturdy material does provide a better grip if you tend to use this phone without a headset. Having said that though, this skin case does not protect the screen (unlike most skin cases for the Treo), so that alone, is a reason to look for other options to protect your phone.Also worth noting, the protective skin case will not fit your Motorola Q if you have opted for the extended battery."
5,excellent overview,"Warren's book is an excellent overview and summary of the major assumptions, events, and personalities of the ColdWar period. It is ideally suited to high school readers."
3,Interesting but slow,Nice concept but no so interesting result. The premise sounds very interestimg but too many sections are too dark...I expected something more psycological and complex...just two guys talking and not very clear conclusions
1,Complete Garbage,"Thank goodness I only rented this film because if I had bought it, I'd be furious. In fact, I'm upset that I wasted 90 minutes and $4 on this ""film"". Its about two men who have sex and film it - and most of it you can't see because the screen is either pitch black or the view of the actors is obstructed. Oh, one of the actors is nice enough to buy food during the film(gee, thanks!)Please people, stay away from this."
4,Reflections on THE NECESSITY FOR RUINS,"J. B. Jackson, the founder and longtime editor of the journal LANDSCAPE, helped readers appreciate, and understand, the modern American landscape--parks and cemeteries, to be sure, but also commercial strips and house types, roads and streetscapes--in all of its marvelous complexity. This short volume contains a number of Jackson's vintage essays. The first and last chapters explain the author's approach to the landscape. Other essays include discussions of gardens and sacred groves, the domestication of the garage, and keys to reading streetscapes. The title essay, ""The Necessity for Ruins,"" begins as a reverie on the importance of public monuments before wryly concluding that history has fallen victim to preservation and the heritage industry. These engagingly written essays are the product of an enquiring mind determined to find meaning in our everyday surroundings.."
5,Brilliant,Nothing compared to the King's Speech but definitely a must see documentary for those who enjoyed watching the King's Speech. It's very informational and inspiring. Gives your an inside exclusive on the King and his struggles with stuttering. I really enjoyed watching the historic footages of King George. I was quite surprised to see Colin Firth do a commentary. This is something everyone should see before or after they watch the King's Speech.
4,King George VI: The Man behind The King's Speech,I really enjoyed this historic retrospective. It enlightened me about King George VI and his formative years. I only wish it had been longer and elaborated a bit more on his relationship with his speech therapist. A good companion DVD for the movie.
3,NOT LONG ENOUGH !!!!,This DVD is a great concert for a true Roberta fan. Mostly because the recorded concerts are so hard to find. Be I really enjoyed this dvd. The quality is really superior(sound and picture). The only negitive is that it's not long enough. I went and seen Roberta in concert last night in Memphis and she only done 9 songs just like this DVD concert. Leaving people wanting more.
5,Eyes glued to the pages,BE WARNED that once you pick up this book you won't be able to put it down. It's a great book!
5,Great!,"This was the very first book that started me off in the direction of romance novels. I started at 10pm one night, and didn't finish until 4am. I refused to put it down. I thought that the book was excellently written. I truly felt each character's emotions. I was also laughing out loud at many of the scenes.I liked Kate's character, although I wish she would have told Wroth off a little more. Especially since her character was a spunky one. I've read this book 3 times over already. I find that there is the same amount of enjoyment each time. It's a truly wonderful love story."

2,I have 2 words for this CD,"And that's broken record! The last CD Mystikal did before dis (Ghetto Fabulous)was off tha chains! This one ain't! For instance, the first track is pretty much like the 7th one except it's like a clean remix. He doesn't yell as much which he's known for. If it was produced from no limit then maybe it would rise a lil higher to impressive. Now he has his greatest hits oot while serving time."
4,Second best Mystikal EVER,"You heard Danger and Neck of da Woods??? that oukast is tite. if you cant buy this, risk stealin it"
5,the real Mystikal is Back Babeee,"yo Mystikal is back , the real Mystikal that is. No limit to how hot Mystikal is without Master P's Bulls@#t. MYstikal lyrics are tight. His album great production work with different beats, sounds , alike Beat by the pound who's beat sound the same. Get the album 5 stars quality all around performance."
2,Lacking (2.5/5),"Life after No Limit wasn't very kind to Mystikal, and even with the Neptunes production this album isn't great. The singles, ""Shake Ya A*s"" and ""Danger"" are fun, good rap songs, but as a whole the album isn't awesome. He doesn't have as much to say, and he spends most of his time bragging about nothing or yelling at nobody in particular. This was entertaining for a few albums, but without the No Limit squad, Mystikal has proven pretty one dimensional. A lot of the songs are similar, and only a few guest appearances lighten up the album. Da Brat and Petey Pablo lend an OK rhyme on ""Come and see about me"" and the best track is obviously ""Neck Uv Da Woodz"", where OutKast pretty much does the entire song. Without C-Murder and Master P and the rest of no limit, Mystikal is lonely, even though this was his most commercial success. People wanting to own some Mystikal ought to buy ""Mind of Mystikal"" or one of his No Limit releases."
4,My man Mystikal,"This is a hit although some of it is not as good as some of his other cuts, but this I can live with. I like the song about his sister. He always seems to represent her well. I Also like his song about all his family. This CD is crackin if you have all the others you better buy this , on the real. This a must have cd for your-No Limit collection!!"
1,"Oh, boy","This is definitely rock bottom for rap. Ever since 2Pac died, it seems that more and more untalented writers have become huge rap stars. What is so amazing about a terrible bass line and some guy who should be working at McDonald's screaming ""DANGER!"" and then going off into complete gibberish. Man, I miss people like 2Pac who are extremely talented writers, and could actually be understood! Do yourself a favor, don't get this CD."
1,THIS ALBUM NEEDS ALOT OF HELP,"STRAIGHT UP, THIS ALBUM SUCKS, THE LYRICS IS WACK AND SO IS THE BEATS. MYSTICAL NEXT TIME DO BETER."
1,"If I ever met Mystikal, I'd spit on him.","His music really sucks. He sounds like someone in the middle of a crack fit, occasionally throwing in a 'Watch Yoself!!'If I ever met him stumbling on the streets, I'd gleefully hock a loogie on him. He deserves that rather than money. Why did he release this??There's a great WBALLS skit on Kurupt's the Streetz iz a mutha where they make fun of Mystikal and the No Limit Dorks. Check it out.No Limit and Mister P should really think about if they really want to ruin rap or not. They're doing a good job of it so far. They even turned Snoop Dogg into total crap. Too bad."
2,not good,"Neptunes dont work at mystikals speed . I agree more guest appearances wouldve been nice, too+ there are some wack songs."
4,THIS ALBUM IS THA SHIZNIT,"This album is awesome i've had this album for like over a year n a half now and i still listen to it like every day this alum would definitely be in the top 30 out of all my albums. the best songs are ""shake ya a**"", ""ready to rumble"", ""jump"", ""danger"", ""i rock, i roll"" & my fave ""mystikal fever""."
3,Its alright,"Nothing special, but its OK. Not as good as his previous efforts. The radio hits are OK, [Shake Ya Ass & Danger], but they is only really one song that is ""outstanding"", being Neck Uv Da Woods (w/ Outkast). There are many songs that are still tight, such as I Rock, I Roll, U Would If U Could, Mystikal Fever, and Ready To Rumble, but not ""outstanding"". This is not a bad album at all, in fact it duznt have many ""bad"" tracks, but Mystikal just hasn't put enough into it. Better than latter releases though. A good listen, so still pick this cd up even if you are just a rap fan, but don't expect too much from it."
5,The Mouth of the South,"Mystikal definitely represents the South. When he says, ""Here I go!!!"", he means it. He never comes weak, and never will. This album is better than his last two because this album isn't based on ""No-Limit-Soldierism"". This album is all about Mystikal. This is a must have, if you are from the South!!! So go and Copp it!!!"
3,Okay album,"Without the No Limit tank behind, Mystikal has straight fallen off. Sure, he may be more popular now but his music fails in comparison to his first 3. The best songs are obivously the singles. Nothing else compares to them. The old Mystikal CD had humorus lyrics with witty punchlines over hot dirty south beats. This CD just comes off very blah and is definitely missing P, Silkk, and C-Murder. Mystikal is okay but his weaknesses are fully exposed on this album."
1,What is this?!?!,"This is the worst cd I have ever heard. I am a huge Jay-Z, Dr. Dre, Nelly, Ludacris fan. What is this!? I listened to shake ya a$$. I was laughing at how bad of rapper this is . His voice sounds like he's some crazy homeless guy rapping! Don't waste your $$ on this trash. rename this song. Shake ya Trash, this the song! Make me peuk! I wanna give this negative stars!"
5,Good Job Alabama,One of the Best live Concert videos I have viewed. Always loved Alabama. The vocials and instrumental are great. The quality of the video is good. The performance is simple with nothing fancy to distract from the music. If your a Alabama fan or just love some good Country Music this is a sure pick. A regret in life is that I never seen Alabama Live.
4,A Good CD With Many Genres Blended,"The songs on this CD seem to have so many different genres blended together with added noises, that they sound very interesting and fresh. I highly recommend listening to the songs ""Rain"", ""Heart Attack"", ""What Would Jesus Do?"", and ""Heart of the Matter"". Those songs are my personal favorites. I look forward to listening to them again sometime soon! I think you could enjoy this CD very much; give it a try!"
5,Intriguing,"I love a mystery, especially when they feature characters capable of intelligent sleuthing, not coincidents, luck, or witnesses to solve the crime for the good guys. Reichs reminds me of Sue Grafton, with a little of Hannibal Lector thrown in. She writes in vivid detail and offers a precise insight into the forensic crime solving method."
3,Better Than Her Last One,"I personally think the first couple of Tempe Brennan books were better than the later ones, but I did enjoy Monday Mourning. I feel the author tends to ramble on with the technical, scientific aspects, which I admittedly don't comprehend, but there are probably many who do. The detailed descriptions with French phrasing of Montreal rather lose me, and I find myself anxious to get on with the story."
2,Monday Mourning,"I have read all of Kathy Reich's books at least 4 times. Dearly love them all except for the last one, Monday Mourning.It was flat and somewhat boring. Mainly, Tempe's unrelenting churlishness toward her love, Andrew Ryan, is tiresome and annoying. (Shut up, woman!) If I were Andrew Ryan, I would head for the door - fast.There has also been a very subtle but noticeable trend from book to book lately of how wonderful and important Tempe is. Come on, Kathy, re-read Deja Dead and get a clue. Tempe was incredibly vulnerable but also strong throughout. Now she is just kind of a self-important, boring woman who seems to be going all out to drive a great guy away.After Bare Bones, Monday Mourning was a disappointment.Pat GannonForest City, NC"
2,Smart Woman Doing Stupid Things.,"If you like books about supposedly intelligent women consistently doing stupid things to create tension and excitement, then this is a book for you. Otherwise, give it a miss. While I like the characters in the book very much, it seems the author loses respect for them about halfway through - having them do very stupid, nonsensical things to create tension, excitement. Because I get so annoyed at a woman, supposedly very intelligent, doing something so stupid to put not only herself, but also her friends in danger - the tension becomes artificial, and, quite frankly, a let down. And it happens over and over again. One more thing - I just don't understand how a trained forensic anthropologist who must always work with things that most of us would find upleasant, could have such an impossibly weak stomach. She got nauseous a lot over unpleasant things in this book. Come on. She should be a stronger heroine!"
4,'Monday Mourning' Proves Dark Entertainment,"Last weekend I read the excellent but almost-too-disturbing-to-finish Monday Mourning. Tempe is back in Montreal for this installment of the Bones-inspiring series. When three sets of bones are found buried in a pizza parlor basement, police are convinced they date to the nineteenth century when the building was built. Tempe has other thoughts on the matter, and she digs until a pattern of missing girls over a series of years emerges. The dark truth revealed in the last few pages caused me to scan rather than read. I wanted to learn what happened, but the details were too much for me (especially right before turning out the light to go to sleep!). Reichs touches on a dark topic in the end which crossed a line I wasn't prepared to cross in my reading for entertainment."
2,bit disappointed,This is the first book I've read by this author and I was drawn to it from the forensics aspect. I was a bit disappointed though - I found the writing to be unpolished. I agree with other reviewers - I don't find Dr. Brennan's private life particularly interesting and the dialogue drags terribly. In fact each time we go back to it it seems to distract from the real interest. And Ryan is just flat out dull and one dimensional. I found this particular subject matter (can't specify without spoiling the plot) very difficult and the references to real cases from the news that we remember very unbalancing. The plus side is that this author is clearly very accomplished in her main profession and that is fascinating. Interestingly she writes very much better as 'herself' when she gives us factual background after the story has ended about how she came to this plot line.
3,Monday Mourning,"This one was a little gruesome for my taste. It was a quick read, however, not enjoyed as much as others written by Ms. Reichs."
4,enjoyable,I have kathy Reiches books hard to put down at times they keep you in suspence and interested while you are reading.
3,Bones in the basement,A little wordy and definitely a lot of procedure. However the twists and turns are unexpected and you never see the last chapter coming.
1,An Improbable Medical Professional,"Temperance Brennan gets more unbelievable by the book, and by the page. According to her stats; lots of experience, formal education culminating in a PhD, and on staff in two countries. This individual is so lacking in self-recognition, so tied up in emotional knots, so devoid of emotional maturity, so unwilling to listen to herself, yet she supposedly functions as a successful medical professional?I don't believe the character. I know three medical professionals very well, and none of them are remotely as unbalanced as Temperance Brennan. Granted, the book is considered entertainment. But the entertainment must be believable, or else considered science fiction.Contrast Charles Dickens with Kathy Reichs. One is an true author, the other is a popular scribbler."
5,Brig. 5 Star General Maria Doreen Mitchell,"Again thank you for bringing in our Hostages from a distant land when former Pres. Carter took the heat, greetings, again much turmoil and unrest in our country American, earth to maria, i hear and am confident that we shall overcome, Armagoden in near future in need....."
2,Can't do it,"After being a Scarpette fan for years, I just can not read this book. It comes from such a similar formula..."
2,"badly written, badly edited","Loved the concept, but the execution leaves much to be desired. Within the first few pages were 10 glaring errors of grammar and word usage. The writing itself brings to mind that of a teenager scribbling while not paying attention in English class."
4,All Daisy Slingshors Recalled -- NOT True,All Daisy Slingshors Recalled -- NOT TrueThe recalled Daisy's have GREEN bands that are secured by balls inserted into the tube ends. The F16 has not been recalled.
3,Let down by poor acoustics,"None of Maazel's soloists (Fantini, Smirnova, Meli and Siwek) entirely disappoints. My major complaint is that the acoustics of the Basilica di San Marco (Venice) are uncomfortably reverberant: the Chorus of the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino (especially in 'Sanctus' and 'Agnus Dei') sounds messy (too many post-echoes) and is always drowned by the crystal-clear Symphonica Toscanini (for the first time, I am aware of hidden orchestral gems that I couldn't hear on any other recording). Maazel's score-less conducting is erratic (89 minutes): 'Dies Irae' and its refrains are rushed, but elsewhere he adopts leisurely tempi that sometimes become anticlimactic (lasting more than 7 minutes, the final section of 'Libera me' - from the fugue onwards - is desperately slow, not at all uplifting). 3 1/2 stars."
1,Not recommended,I am a preschool teacher and purchased this product based on the online reviews. I was very disappointed. The songs have a very outdated sound to them. I do no recommend this cd.
3,Memorial Day-V. Flynn,Another great book by Vince Flynn. He captivates your imagination and paints a great picture to wrap yourself in the situation. I don't know if a movie would fully do justice to his books.
4,Mitch Rapp is THE MAN,I have read 8-10 of the Mitch Rapp's series. I enjoy the development of all the characters by Vince Flynn. I also think that Rapp's work ethic and his attention to detail makes him an ideal American hero. We should all be proud of the sacrifices that our military and covert operators perform for the USA.
5,AS GOOD AS TERM LIMITS,"This book is just as good as Flynn's original Term Limits. Great action, great story line and very realistic given today's climate. The main character Mitch Rapp says and does the things we wish we could hear from our own politicians. The politically correct crowd in this book face the real truth, not their own liberal truths. And I was glad to see that Mr. Flynn avoided all of the husband/wife trials and tribulations that were so prevelant in the last book."
5,Mitch Rapp For President!,"This is one terrific read. I'd had it sitting on my shelf for months and months without picking it up to read. Finally, one night, after not being able to get into any of the current books on my nightstand I picked this one up, and boy am I glad I did. I literally had a 2 day reading bonanza with this one. Scary, thrilling, realistic (okay somewhat), and set in today's world. Forget any of the bozos running for president currently in both parties, let's elect Mitch Rapp as President! Vince Flynn, you have earned a reader for life with this one. I can hardly wait to read the next adventure of Mitch Rapp. Pick it up and get going....go on what are you waiting for?"
2,"Ok, what happened","This is the first Flynn thriller that pretty much let me down. I don't know the politics involved in writing and publishing books but deadlines, other interests, or just plain writers block seemed to have overshadowed this book. Too bad because it only gets worse after this one. Sorry Vince."
5,Awesome Novel,"Vince Flynn is easily one of my favorite authors. This was the first book I read of his and ever since then I have been hooked to the rest. Memorial Day stands out as one of my clear favorites, but I highly highly reccommend all of his other books as well."
2,"Too much politic'n, not enough Mitch","Just as Clancey began to run into trouble when Jack got too important/old, so too Flynn is having problems keeping Mitch real as he ages and gets more advanced in his career. Flynn also wastes a lot of time praising the Patriot Act, denegrating the left, and justifying torture. Rapp does what we does because it needs to be done (and he always has). We don't need the author to waste our time and his pages trying to politically justify those actions and vilify those with whom he disagrees."
5,Awesome,"I had trouble going on with my daily activities because i had not yet finished Memorial Day. It's a great read about terrorism and if you love the Fox show 24, then Mitch Rapp is your new Jack Bauer. He's gritty, aggressive, and insubordinate which are the only qualities of heroism against terrorism. Trust me, if you like CIA novels, this will be an excellent addition to your Vince Flynn arsenal."
5,Mitch Rapp is my kind of guy,"As previous reviewer said, if you are politically correct type this will not be your cup of tea. I loved this book. Main character is decisive and knows how to get things done. Whatever it takes. Never read Vince Flynn before but I will definately try his other books in the future."
2,Great book. Well written. But too realistic and therefore a downer.,"Scary but realistic story but not for me. I'd rather escape if I'm going to read fiction. However if you like hard hitting, current event based action and intelligence genre novels, you will love this."
2,Definitely NOT the best Rapp so far,"I enjoy the Mitch Rapp novels a lot, and this is the worst one by far. It was a complete fizzle. But come on, give Mr Flynn a chance. One bad hit now and then is okay, right? The problem here is the choice of story. Its overpopular at the moment, and Mr Flynn simply didn't do as good a job as others have done. I am not going to give a long review here. There are several excellent and on-the-mark reviews here already: check out those by Karina Jensen, Rory Morty and Action Book Enthusiast. I agree with everything that they have written. Come on - you guys awarding five starts to this one can't be serious - it's not worth half of that. But that fact aside, I remain excited for the next Mitch Rapp novel."
5,The best terrorist novel yet.,"A fast paced novel that will make you re-think how we should treat suspected terrorists. Very believable, well written, and timely. I couldn't put it down."
5,I line up for vince flynn books,Outstanding... action packed... I hope there are operatives in the USA that are like Mitch Rapp... we need more of him! ! !
4,Action thriller,Not quite as good as some of the earlier Mitch Rapp books but still a good read all the same
5,great book!!!!!,"As usual, Vince Flynn delivers and wrote a fantastic book about Mitch Rapp and taking out terrorists. It's nice to see someone fight back against these cowardly maggots."
2,Needs Editing,"This is a fast-paced book with all the formulaic elements required of a political thriller. Nothing here particularly surprised me. I would guess that if you have enjoyed Mr. Flynn's other works you will enjoy this one as well.Mr. Flynn needs a more assertive editor. His use of language is so sloppy as to distract a reasonably sensitive reader from the finer points of the story. This probably isn't detrimental to the reader's comprehension, but it is irritatng.Finally, one very minor quibble: non-standard spellings are used throughout (such as ""harken"" rather than ""hearken""). This may or may not matter to any given reader, but I found it to be worthy of mention."
2,"Good story, too much propaganda","This is the the third Mitch Rapp booK I've read and I never tire of the adventure and intrigue. Memorial Day does have the adrenaline, but bogs down with the psycho-babble of the characters trying to figure out if torture is justified, legal, or moral. The argument isn't solved by Flynn, just his point of view vividly portrayed. At least he does give space to the other side. I'm sure I'll get back to Flynn/Rapp. I'll just wait to see if he resolves the question himself and sticks to what makes him a brilliant espionage writer.Ron LealosAuthor of Don't Mean Nuthin'"
4,Another Good Flynn Book,I read most Flynn books but read this one while on a cruise. It is a bit below average for the author. He does show a good knowledge of Mt Weather and its mission. I am judging this book by the others I have read. It is a good read with good details. I enjoy the series and just wished the US CT effort worked this way and had this kind of support. DCI Casey would have loved Mitch.
5,One of his best!,"I loved this guy when he first burst on the scene, with his irreverent espionage, bigger than life characters and moxie.But some of his books are better.This is one of his best."
2,not as good as his early work,"This one just didn't have ""it"" the early books did. Disappointing, though palatable."
1,over-sized paperback,"be aware that this paperback edition is a new format that is over sized (about 2 inches taller than normal mass-market paperbacks). In order to justify this format, the type appears to be slightly larger and the spacing between lines is noticeably larger. And, of course, the publisher had to increase the price to reflect the ""bigger book"". It is awkward to hold and won't fit on the bookshelf with the rest of your Vince Flynn paperbacks (Mr. Flynn - your publisher is using an experimental book size and it will affect your sales)"
1,Bad Timing,"Another far-right-wing, testosterone-drenched potboiler. The hero is hindered from saving the country at every turn by left-wing nincompoops incapable of logical thinking-- primarily career-climbing image-conscious women, of course. The primary message of this book is that if only we could further restrict the Bill of Rights and allow the agents of our government a free hand in torturing prisoners, America would be much better off. Given the recent news, the timing of this message could not be worse."
3,Mitch Rapp can do anything,"""Memorial Day"" is good segment in the series. I realize that it's fiction to begin with but Mr. Rapp's capabilities and power are getting a bit stretched. For example, the President listens to Mitch over his own cabinet members???"
4,Excellent political thriller,"The thing that comes to mind when reading this is, ""Tom Clancy-Lite"". The style and subject matter bring to mind an early Tom Clancy, but without all the unnecessary political grandstanding. And at 400 pages, it's a much quicker read. This is an excellent, fast-paced, and timely thriller. There are constant twists throughout the novel, and not just one climax at the end, which makes it a more entertaining read. This is the first book by this author that I have read, but I'll be picking up some of his earlier work. This isn't great ""literature"", but it's perfect for the beach or on a long plane ride."
2,Can't recommend this one,"Well, we seem to have a lively disagreement here. Everybody either loves or hates it.... so, I thought I'd add my sixpence too. I picked this one up because I liked some of this authors previous stuff. This one DID dissapoint. It was unoriginal. There are better novels on the topic. Nothing personal against Mr Flynn, but it is a big letdown after his other Mitch Rapp novels. Facts are facts. But maybe the next one will be better?"
4,Solid CD..,This is his strongest CD since TOTAL CONTROL...His guitar work is excellent and John handles all of the vocals this time. His vocal work is very good..He has a new rhythm section and they are very tight unit..John Norum fans will be very happy with this CD.
5,A wordsmiths delight,This book is absolutely delicious! It is full of puns and hidden references. The exercise in devouring this little gem is worth every second. I didn't want it to end. It is a writers read as well as a readers read I recommend it to everyone who enjoys words. Don't waste another minute buy it! Doesn't hurt if you have spent time in Paris either.
2,A huge disappointment,"The vast majority of the book has no relation to the title. There are great passages, but they are largely buried under dozens of pages of yammering prelude, silly bickering, and attempts at drunken humor. James Morrow's Blameless in Abaddon covers the same theme with much greater depth and breadth."
5,Landmarks: on black history,"This book, though out of print by the publisher, is thus far the most inclusive, informative, and entertaining 'Traveler's guide' on the subject. Mr. Cantor has done his homework on listing specific locations with relevant historic facts. As well, it has quick reference info- that serves as a kind of 'mini source-guide' for the researcher, or the history buff. R,Cobb."
1,item appears larger online,even though I read the dimentions this bench still was extremely small. I had toreturn it and I usually never return stuff. Way too small. Doll furniture.
3,"Mixes very common performances with rarities, not too bad","This cd has some fairly well known jazz vocal pieces, some bordering on pure 50's pop like Louis Armstrong's timeless romantic rendition of Kidd To Build a dream on. However mixed with the more common Armstrong, Dinah Washington and Peggy Lee performances are the rarer Lee Wiley, Leo Watson, and Mildred Bailey! Where else can you get Satchmo crooning Kiss To Build a dream on and King Pleasure's Bi-polar-esque reading of I'm In The mood For Love on one cd, a good sampler for beginners'"
1,TOTALLY DISGUSTED,"My daughter loves Dora and will be so disappointed on Christmas when she has no furniture for her house. Fisher Price should have anticipated the high demand for these items and planned accordingly. In addition, Toysrus should have demanded a better supply of these the furniture to compliment the supply of houses. [...]"
1,NO FURNITURE!,"I like so many others, have purchased the Dora Talking House (after searching far and wide to find one) only to discover that the furniture that accompanies the house cannot be found. I have yet to find any furniture that BELONGS IN THE HOUSE! I have successfully found the talking 'Greenhouse' and outdoor 'Pool', but nothing to furnish the inside of the house. My niece is very disappointed and even cried on Christmas day. I cheered her with thoughts of all the furniture we'd buy as soon as Christmas was over... and had to take my words back when I couldn't produce anything. I am hightly disappointed with Fisher Price..."
4,Happy but disappointed at the same time,"My 4yr.old daughter, Morgan, loves her Dora dollhouse. But it is really a shame that she does not have any furniture for the dollhouse. This is really an inconvience to the parents,as well as a big disappointment to the children. Fisher Price really needs to compensate customers by reducing the prices on the furniture. After all, the customers are the ones who made Dora dollhouse a big success this Christmas!!!!!!!!!"
4,Dora Doll House Must,"I resorted to this website when I found out that all the pieces for doras house were not included!!! I purchased this from amazon.com because Toys R Us told me they have a shortage of furniture pieces. The place where Im located only had a few pieces left but had about 50 dollhouses with no pieces. The only thing not included was the Kitchen set. My kid is gonna be thrilled this christmas when she has all the pieces to go with it, hurry now though these pieces wont last long..."
5,Dora's Talking Doll House Accessories,My three year old daughter loves these accessories. They were easy for her to figure out on how to operate and they are very durable. Not to mention they come in fun bright colors and are very fitting to the doll house. Definetly a good buy!!
1,how do you rate something you can't get,"I too was able to find the house, but the furniture is nowhere to be found. This is poor planning, to give a child a dollhouse and not the furniture. I am seriously considering returning the house, espicially since it looks as if the furniture is not even available within a reasonable time frame. As a grandmother, I would not recommend this product due to the situation. I would think that you would consider the financial impact on your company and offer some incentive to get people to return to purchasing your products. Grandparents are a significant factor in your retail industry. At this time I would not recommend buying Fisher Price. To know how disappointing this is for myself, I would not give ""half a gift"" and disappoint a child. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!!"
1,How did this happen?,The only toy my daughter want for Christmas is the Dora Talking House. I purchased it for her back in November not knowing initially that the furniture wasn't included. Why wouldn't they include the furniture in a $50 plastic dollhouse????? I work at Target and it has never come in since Nov. I too have looked at every store and am not willing to pay tons of money for this set on ebay. I am VERY DISAPPOINTED with Fisher Price and I am one of their best customers. Arrgh. It's turning me into the Grinch.
1,Cant Find Funiture Pieces NO WHERE!!!,I am very disappointed about not finding the pieces to the house. I have like others searched everywhere and only by luck found the bedroom set. I thought that at the price of the house when i purchased it that the funiture was included. Why is it so hard to keep up with the demand for the funiture.
1,Ridiculouly hard to find & too expensive,I bought this for my daughters at Christmas there was no furniture available at the time. Here it is 4 mo's later & still can't get it! I wish I'd never bought the house to begin with!
5,May not be a marketing scam,"I purchased this furniture in the middle of October and then got the Kitchen set from FP. I don't believe this is a marketing scam. I believe eBay sellers saw that this was going to be a hot holiday item. They took the opportunity, since the furniture sets were sold separately, to purchase every available one they could find and sell them on eBay for more than triple the price. I was just lucky enough to notice the furniture wasn't included when I purchased it (I'm an early shopper). I immediately got online and ordered it to be sure I could get it. The only fault with FP is that they didn't sell the items together, thus making a gateway for eBay sellers to make lots of money on these hot items. I'm sure there will be truck loads of these sets available after Christmas. I would say our daughters will be happy with just the house until the furniture is available. Hang in there!"
4,We only needed the Media Room for Dora's Dollhouse,"There wasn't a problem with the toys. My daughter only needed the media room and apparently it isn't sold separtely as yet. I'd already purchased the other rooms of furniture, however, I didn't know that my daughter had already opened the packages. So I returned the furniture sets that I purchased from Amazon. We will have to wait and hope that the media room will become avaiable soon as an individual item. Thanks anyway."
5,What is going on?,"I ordered the Dora Talking Doll House, only to receive it and find out that all the furniture is not included. I went to Toys R Us, Wal Mart and Target and NOT A SINGLE STORE HAS THE FURNITURE IN STOCK! Toys R Us store informed me that the item has been ""discontinued""! Unbelievable. I would think that they would make enough furniture to match the quanities of houses made. My daughter will love getting the house, but is sure to be disappointed when she finds no furniture available. I am very disappointed."
1,empty doll house-shame on fisher price,"All my 3 year old wanted for Christmas was the Dora Doll House. It was all she talked about for months. So as her 1 large gift from Santa she got it, but empty. So what did Fisher Price do only slam out a million doll houses @ $50.00 or more a pop while stopping production of the furniture gift set. It makes no sense why a company would make so many doll houses but not enough furniture for that doll house. I guess that is why CEO's get the big bucks-for being dump as rocks. Shame on Fisher-Price. [...]"
3,dissappointed,"I have a daughter who is 4 years old and she loves dora. For christmas like many other parents I purchased the dora talking dollhouse but became very upset because no one had any furniture available. I have been online, I call the stores everyday, i have stopped numerous times on my way to work,target,walmart,kmart,toysrus and no luck. This toy was very poorly thought out I have resulted in buying other dollhouse furniture so my daughter can try and enjoy this toy."
3,Stop buying them on EBAY!!!!,"Thie toy is nice. We all need some patience. Set an example for your children that patience is in fact a virtue. And most importantly stop rewarding the greedy people on ebay by paying three times the retail price for something! If we stop letting ourselves get ripped off the prices will drop on ebay. Plus you don't need all the sets...they don't all fit. One bedroom, not two, no living room you already have a couch that came with it. Plus you can preorder the kitchen set on fisherprice.com and guarantee you pay only 10 bucks."
2,fisher price gets 0 stars for this one,"I have to igree with many here, it's one thing to get a doll house and then have to get furniture, but come on ship ENOUGH furniture for the houses you make. What kid whats to play in a EMPTY house, not for very long.Fisher-Price really messed up this time, message to them make more furniture for all the kids (and parents) who got the houses we NEED the furniture. Please stock the stores.!!!"
1,Not easy to find,"You don't have this item in stock and I need it. I have the house and no furniture when well this be in stock or is it discontinued, I need to know the status of this item. Please e-mail me back as soon as possible so I can know the status."
1,Broken in Shipping,"I think the grill would have been good if it hadn't been broken when I got it. And of course they were all sold out, so I had to get a refund."
4,Nice Grill,"Got this grill as something to use for just me and my husband. This is our first grill, so we did not realize that it takes awhile to get warm, so make sure that you are not too hungry at the time you start. It's very heavy and well built. Easy to assemble and use."
3,OK but ...,"I bought this [at $40] primarily because I wanted to revisit my childhood and that there are no wooden handles to burn up. Now that I've had my jollies, I thing I'll go back to my small Weber. 3-4 cups of coals is more than enough. The drop down front really serves no purpose. The sliding draft plate means one side [only] can be made hotter than the other. Large enough for two 16-oz steaks or six 1/2-lb burgers or eight lamb chops. As with any hibachi, no way to smother coals. You'll wonder what all the extra screw holes are for too!"
5,She Sounds Great- but...,What's with the price? They need to release this in the states! I would pay 42 dollars for dvd audio Beach Boys masters but not for this. But when they release it stateside- yeah she has a great voice.
1,Don't buy it! Period!,"The product is bogus. It does not work at all. The one I bought is probably rotting in a garbage dumpster somewhere. Don't buy it. It's just a rip off. Didn't do anything for me and left me with a bad taste. If there was a zero star rating, I would have give it that. :)"
1,It sucks....BAD,"This Cd is what's wrong with America today. Poorly composed, Angry lyrics, poor audio recording quality...pops and hisses....a real bomb....don't buy!"
3,not the best,"I love Michelle Reid,but this book seemed to have a hasty ending. Carlos likes Francesca, but she is engaged to another man. Francesca catches her fiance with another women and ends up in bed with Carlos the same night. The book starts really strong but the ending is rushed and leaves unanswered questions."
1,"Bulky, doesn't hold bottles, ice melts too fast.","The bottles are not supported properly with this set up, it is extremely bulky, and the ice pack melts so fast that it is pretty much worthless. I used it once, and it has sat in a box ever since."
2,Bulky and Droopy!,"Let's assume you're looking at The IceWrap BYOC because you want a convenient way to keep a bottle cold all morning until picnic time. ""...a CONVENIENT way...""I'll put it on the table for you: This product is somewhat lacking in the convenience department.The IceWrap BYOC doubles the diameter of your bottle and adds weight. If your bottle is smaller, (Co. claims you can use it on bottles as small as .5 liter.) it becomes lost in the masses of frozen jelly pads and flops around.Getting an ice chest or freezing the drinks themselves would be better choices.The product DOES keep bottles cold, so for wine or champagne it might be worth the added bulk."
4,oh zizek...,"This is one of the my favorites by Zizek (the other being The Fragile Absolute). Zizek is a master at diagnosing the contemporary game for what it is: synthetic, gnostic, and without meaning (Nietzsche wins?!). Yet, he does so in a way that provides, perhaps theoretically, some sort of intellectual resources for how to go beyond our dual fascination with all things material and, paradoxically, immaterial. Plus, he is just a fun read. He is one of few writers that I genuinely can return to time and time again (even if it is to discover exactly where I disagree with him)."
2,not that easy,"This is a review from someone without a background in philosophy - and that may be where part of the problem lies....I have been reading books from the ""Thinking in Action"" series, and consequently moved on to this one by Zizek. I found it very difficult to follow the lines of discussion. This was for two reasons: (i) the author assumes a lot of background knowledge on the part of the reader, making a lot of (unexplained) references, (ii) the author has an incredibly rambling style.If you are in the field of philosophy, perhaps this book will have more meaning for you. If you are a beginner, you may want to steer clear."
1,GOOD SONGS RUINED!!!,Why did they have to ruin these great songs by adding all of this mindless studio chatter? Infuriating!!!
2,A pale reproduction of the real Remains,"Barry and the Remains had a superb reputation as being a killer live act, with tons of soul, hard rockin' power, and listenability. When they stepped into the recording studio, that all washed away by corporate bigwigs who wanted them to be the next Beatles or something similar. The one awesome tune here, ""Don't Look Back"", is stuffed at the bottom of a pretty thin track listing. For a much better vision of this infamous garage band, purchase A SESSION WITH THE REMAINS, a live demo recorded to entice a record company to sign a contract with them. It's much grittier, more exciting, and shows the real talent this band really had."
1,Irwin Tap & Drill Set not as pictured,"The Irwin 13-PC. Tap and Drill Set does not come with the case as pictured. The tap & drill set is complete but no case. I""m an electrician and had this tap set with case as pictured before and was expecting the same. IT'S NOT!! That was the reason I bought it again. I hope the clear thin plastic container it's shipped in is not considered a case. It will never stand up in the trade. I am superised amazon allows this by the Irwin supplier. Be carefull what you see it may not be what you get!"
4,Cooling comfort,"Thank you for your prompt service and great products. This product is great for any pimples, dry skin, or skin irritation. It helps to heal these symptoms. This reminds me of Sephora's Minted Rose Salve, except without the rose fragrance. Thumbs up!"
4,"Great, Solid and overall complete","I'm a graphic artist who works with many applications open meanwhile listening to streaming music over a cable modem and this desktop doesn't even blink handling all that. The Hyperthreading technology is incredible while the Pentium 2.6 GHz just shoots everything at lightning speed. The only thing I'd change though is getting another video card because the one installed is a shared AGP and the graphics can get chunky and choppy when it's stretched thin.Otherwise solid, solid performance by Sony."
4,It's Been Many Years,"I haven't played this game since about 1989/1990. It was incredibly fun, but very difficult. Then again, I was 7 or 8 years old last time I played this game :-) If you like games like Duck Hunt, or just those ""old school shooters"" I highly recommend this classic."
2,"looks okay, but defective",Be sure to always check the reviews for other color models for purchases. My silver one turned out to keep inaccurate time and one of the timers died completely a short time after purchase. Only when I came back to add a negative review did I find someone bought a yellow one a year and a half ago and had the same problem.
4,It was the best,"I would give this card 5 out of 5 last year. In this price range which I paid around $330, this card has the best performance/dollar ratio. However, recent release 8800GT took away the spotlight. Below is the summary.8800GT 512mb is no doubt faster than 8800GTS 640mb. I hate to say this since I love my GTS. The fact is simply because GT has higher core/shader clocks & number of shaders.8800GT is marked cheaper than GTS lines which makes it the best performance/buck ratio winner.Finally, if you're wondering how GTS 640mb handles Crysis and some hardware consuming games, the answer is it can easily cruise through COD4, Bioshock with high setting but not Crysis. You need SLI 8800GTX to do so.Conclusion:This is an amazing card with powerful capacity to handle all the games on today's shelf except Crysis. (It can still give you excellent experience if you know how to adjust settings.)The card by itself is 5 starts. Put it next to 8800GT makes it 4 starts."
3,Decent,Decent card runs good enough on World of Warcraft with out noticing too much lag. of course I do have my graphics down so I am not running at 15fps on avg i run about 35-45fps when Doing something and around 50-73fps when idle. Overall this card id a good starter card but you would really want to upgrade the card after a few weeks or months. I would prefer the GeForce GTX 650 because the card runs decently and only costs around 95$ I have two in SLI and I get about 100fps or more in combat and about 170 idle. For screw around in Iron forge I get around 200+
4,"Good product, good price","It's exactly as described. I've had no issues with it. I was just a bit misled, I hoped putting this in SLI would enable me to play games on 3 screens, unfortunately that's not the case. But overall it's a great product."
5,Great Hardcore punk band,"FIFH is a great band! The music has the sound of earlier Agnostic Front, while the vocals tend to sound more of Discharge, but with a different voice.Overall, FIFH is a great Hardcore punk band and I say buy it. Gotta love how much passion is put into the album."
4,The Concept of Our Great Power,"The Concept of Our Great Power is an instructional work addressed to a community or congregation by an anonymous author. It contains a markedly apocalyptic salvation history, and its outlook is such that, with certain reservations, it may usefully be termed Gnostic. Williams' treatment of this tractate is well researched and delivered with a clear sense of purpose, namely: to sharpen our focus on the importance this often overlooked text holds for gnostic studies. Readership: All those interested in Nag Hammadi studies, Gnosticism, Apocalyptic studies, Coptology, Christian origins, the history of religion, New Testament studies, Judaism, church history and ancient history."
5,Diatonic Tenor / Alto Metallophone,I received this item within days of my telephone order. It was exceptionally well-packaged and all items were in perfect condition. The sound is wonderful! The quality of this instrument is well worth the investment. Completely satisfied from start to finish.
2,Does not last long,"Worked great for awhile, but less than 1 yr and the bulb wont come on..the red sensor flashes but no light...should think the product would last more than 1 year, but i guess you get what you pay for..."
1,Atrocious Customer Service by HeathCo !,"My unit arrived with a broken filament in the bulb. So I thought no problem, a quick call and I'll get a new bulb - wrong. I contacted the manufacturer, HeathCo. Their customer service line said they were closed for the holidays, even though it was Jan 12, 2012. I then sent a message through their web support. I was sent an automated response that had nothing to do with my problem.So I had to call them and send two more emails before they finally sent me a bulb that arrived on Jan 28. But after all this, they sent the WRONG bulb. I gave them their model number for the unit and they still sent the WRONG bulb!So how many HeathCo employees does it take to send a light bulb? I wouldn't know, I'm still waiting for the right one!"
5,Virgil's Aeneid Bucolics Eclogues and Georgics Interlinear translations,This book is excellent for the Latin student doing translations and also to be read in Latin for enjoyment. For translations it should be used only as a last resort for the student of Latin. It is excellent for this purpose as the translations given are quite literal. It would not be suitable for a non Latin reader to read in English.
3,Meh,"I had to give it at least 3 stars based soley on the fact that is is Rocky and Bullwinkle. I was very surpised to see this dollar DVD while I was standing in line at Wal-Mart. There are some goods and bads with this purchase:The Good - It's only a dollar, and its Rocky and Bullwinkle.The Bad - The video quality is very poor, and the audio goes in and out.Final word: Its worth a dollar."
1,not at all happy,"Broke in two days. The weight and the motor that make it roll on the floor has no go. tried to change batteries, to no avail.Bought another, same deal. gave up. (...).My 9 month oldd loved it for two days.."
3,interesting,"I bought this toy for my son when he was 6 months old to get him crawling. He loved and still (9 months old) loves to bat at the feet and try to eat the small balls. I was disappointed in the toy after I changed the batteries. It has never been the same no matter what I do. It still rolls, but the music sounds like it's playing at a slower speed, and when it stops rolling the music plays again at normal speed."
1,toch and crawl pooh is better,I tried this toy to get my kids to crawl but they thoght it was boring so I tried toch and crawl pooh and it worked instantly!!Dont buy this its a wast of money
1,"Toy Review from Mechanicsburg, PA",I bought this toy for my daughter when she was 9 months old and crawling fairly well. The consept is fantastic however the toy itself takes too much manual manipulation to get it to go. Once it does go it doesn't go very far. My daughter lost interest after a day. My money would have been better spent elsewhere.
3,Good toy but loses its touch in 2 days,It could be that or It's because she is already walking.I bought this toy for my sister but I think it should roll longer.
3,Bitter Vengeance : The Forgoten Thriller,"Bitter Vengeance is a good thriller. It is not a classic by any means, but it is a good friday night thriller. The plot is simple, a security guard bored with his job and life decides to take advantage of his position. What I really liked about the robbery is that the director chose to include it at the very beginning of the movie, as to keep the viewer's attention. From here, the plot twists and turns as the guard (Greenwood) trys to escape to Mexico. All the actors do a decent job of acting, except the wife, who is played too hysterically. Overall, a good action/suspense movie. Enjoy! P.S. Not worth spending $74 on :)"
2,Disturbing readings...,"This collection is terribly read, especially the woman's voice, the strange crying tune she had bothered me so much that none of the words registered. If you like to buy an audio reading of poems, I highly recommend the collection producted by BBC, it is so far the best."
2,"Pretty, but they fell apart","I had these for maybe 4 months before the stone fell out of one of them. Of course, not being able to find the stone, I could not have them repaired."
1,Liars and Cheaters,"Bought a pair of prescription safety glasses through their website and have been having a problem with them ever since. Paid over $185 for the product, the quality is poor, they say I have ""transition lenses"" (an extra $50) and they aren't. Readers are incorrect. Very dis-pleased and their customer service is the WORST I think I've ever received from an Internet purchase."
3,Kind of Disturbing,I thought the book was very informative because I did not know about the bible and all the rules of their God before i read this. But I also learned that their god is very cruel and was disturbing to hear about the nasty and torcherous things he did. I felt that the characters were all trapped and couldn't get out or do anything to be free. The slightest thing they did wrong they could be killed for. That I did not like about the story. I thought there was too much death and suffering. But it was helpful because before this i hadn't heard about anything happening after they crossed the ocean. So I would reccommend this book but not to people who dont like gruesome or evil things.
2,Escape From Egypt Book review,"The book Escape From Egypt by Sonia Levitin is a well written book about two lovers trying to get out of Egypt. We enjoyed the setting if the book! The characters in the book have a strong will and passion for life.The book had it's ups and downs, some parts were very dull vecause the author crammed too much informantion into some parts that were very exciting and action filled.We thought that the author put things ub a point if view that other people could understand."
2,Not as good as it could've been,"I was interested in this book when I found in at the library because I like reading fiction set in ancient egypt and because it was about the Exodus. But I was disapointed. At some times, it's too rushed, and then at other times it drags on, making you want to skip pages. Also, the characters (one of the most important aspects of a book for me) just didn't draw me in and make me really like (or really hate) them. And...it was just the writing style, the unexplainable feel of the book that didn't work out for me. So, I wouldn't reccomend it."
2,Two Young Egyptians one a Hebrew slave and their voyage,This book was good used as an eduacational tool. But some parts were confusing and hard to understand there were too mnay different traits of different characters. There were many parts thar twere too elaborate and boring!
4,FUN TO READ!,"I had such a great time reading this book. It's one of the first books in years that I enjoyed reading just for the fun of it. I didn't want it to end, and went to look for more of Sonia Levitin's books. I might have changed the ending if I could've, however."
2,Escape From Egypt. review,"The book Escape From Egypt by Sonia Levitin is a well written book about two lovers trying to get out of egypt. We enjoyed the setting of hte book. The chacters in the book have a strong will and passion for life.The book had it's ups and downs, some parts were very dull because the author crammed too much information into some parts of the story. We thought that the author put things in a point of view that other people could understand."
1,FRUSTRATION PLUS,"The previous reviewer who gave this mess a single star was generous with his/her time. The author's ""gee whiz"" style, his complete lack of writng competance (did this author take English Composition past the 7th Grade Level?), and the publisher's inability to render a clear illustration in the whole book grate on one's nerves so badly that you have to steel yourself before begining another session with this book. This could have been a great book; it isn't, but buy it anyway for the sake of the author's only success with his material - you actually feel that you are there in the mid-30's with the story's key players when you read this mess."
1,No Good Deed Goes Unpunished,"I learned many years ago if you do not have anything good to say about something, keep your mouth shut. Normally I follow this rule but this book is so horrible it merits comment.From the photo quality to the grammer to the quality of the paper to the unnecessary ""filler"" (Railroad Jargon), one must wonder the intent of the publisher. Therefore I place responsibility on the publisher, not the author. The author IS responsible for the technical content of the book which is marginal.I use the word ""book"" loosely when referring to this document, it is, at best, a high school term paper with a nice cover.I do give the author credit for at least trying, I wish I had the motivation to write something."
2,Maine Thing,"This CD has a special place in my heart. I live in Maine and have seen 6gig about 5-6 times. They always put on a good show, and their songs have lots of energy. As far as Tincan Experiement goes, its a good CD, but as someone else said there are a few skipable songs. 5, hit the ground, and yesterday stand out as my favorites. They are worth a listen if you have never heard them before."
3,Pretty Gosh Darn Diddly Boring,"It is hard to classify this album. Sometimes it comes off as Nu-Metal, sometimes its punk and the majority of the the time it is a straight pop record. This album i would advise most hard music fans to stay away from, it is pretty boring."
1,Hopeless garbage can filler,"Hi, my name is Andy E. I love all of today's best mainstream rock acts, like Bizkit, Korn, Incubus, and especially those progressive, pre-pubescent hotties in the pop-punk rock genre. Besides that, I have a HUGE white-boy jones for rap, especially when its mixed with metal. I dare not deviate from the mainstream.6Gig couldn't write a decent song if one was provided to them during the second coming of Jesus. ""Method""?!? Give me a friggin' break. Stay FAR away, but I don't think that I need to tell most people that (as I'm sure that their record sales reflect)."
4,6gig hits big!,"6gig is by far our best local band, and im more then glad to see them succeed. Hailing straight from Portland, Maine, 6gig exploded onto the sceen with instant popularity. This is a GREAT cd. From the melodic sounds of Tincan Experiment, to the pounding chords of 5, this cd is perfection. Buy it. Now."
4,A Very good debut indeed!,"I think this album is very well put together with some very catchy tunes. A worthwhile pick up for any hard rock fan. Also worth checking out is Sicboy, and their debut Artificial Flavors. Both bands represent a burgeoning Northeast rock scene. Check em out."
1,Hazards of Halogen Light,"Light output excellent. But what happens if the motion-detector timer fails to shut off and the high-heat producing halogen bulb stays on?In my case, it caused the outer plastic housing to melt down and possibly to have caught fire, just two weeks after installed. Fortunately, it was self-limiting, but the heat blistered the paint on the wood siding on which the light was mounted. The siding could have, but did not, catch fire, or else the house could have burned down. The manufacturer said it shouldn't happen. But it did. And if it happened once, it can happen again."
4,Good Product ...,"This item works exactly as expected. It's bright, detects movement pretty good.The ""Range"" advertised is slightly questionable ... I've never been able to get more than 20 - 30 ft activation ... Perhaps its the way I've aligned it or perhaps mine is a one-off-freak unit (OR Zenith hasn't read the ""Truth In Advertising"" Guidelines)In any case, it works perfectly for my needs and I'm happy with it!"
4,Good Value,Easy to install...all hardware was included...replaces same lights that had been in place since house was built over 7 years ago. Other light from big box store failed within a year.
3,Probably fine for an older child...,"My daughter is 6 1/2 and we've been struggling with trich for about 4 months now. This book may be helpful for an older, very motivated child or adolescent. Though my daughter reads far above her grade level it did not hold her interest and the suggestions are too involved and complex for her to follow. I'll put it away for now in case we need it later, though I hope we won't!"
5,Great for Kids,Gave this to a 10 year old girl who has trichotillomania. She loved the book. She was able to follow it and use it and it made her feel special!
5,Very helpful for pullers of all ages,"Excellent behavior modification resource for pullers of all ages. While the format of the workbook is geared toward children and adolescents, the underlying principles and techniques used in the book will help all pullers. The authors identify 6 main reasons we pull, then lead us through exercises in which the puller identifies their particular triggers related to each of those 6 reasons, and tailors a program that addresses their own unique pulling patterns. For example, what situations or environments do you pull in? Are you aware or unaware when you are pulling? Does a need to fiddle or to have something in your mouth play a part in your pulling? The book helps you identify you patterns and gives concrete suggestions on how to deal with them. The authors are very understanding and compassionate."
4,Easy to read and scientifically based,"Professionals who study and treat trichotillomania and those who suffer from this often devastating disorder have long awaited a book such as this one. The procedures presented are based on state-of-the-art theories and techniques developed by the authors and their colleagues, nationally known experts who have led the field in creating sound, scientifically based treatments programs for trichotillomania. Although targeted primarily for young people who suffer from the disorder, the book also will be of significant value to parents and other relatives who often helplessly watch the devastating effects of this condition. Adult patients and mental health professionals also will benefit from this valuable resource."
2,"god product, poor packing",I love this product and have used it for a while. I received the package with the clonex open and spilled all over the remainder of the shipment. What a mess.
3,it is ok.,"If you live on island and lazy enough not to read the original very good documentation that comes with FC suite (both printed and in help pdfs) you may learn thing or two from this series. In general I dislike the presentations as the guys apparently not big gurus, have problem to say a word in front of the camera had read everything from the prompter. The entire thing is very tiresome, stiff and somewhat shallow. They need avid and knowledgeable presenter who can talk in front of the cam. But I guess it is deficiency of all in kitchen made videos."
5,Something To Think About,"Wow, this really is a great book. It opened up my eyes to seeing things in a more positive way, there's something in it for everyone no matter what your beliefs may be."
5,One of the best books available!,I have found this book to be an amazing fountain of wisdom and would recommend anyone who wants to know more about life and how to live happily to read it. This book has scientifically explained the crux of human life and is applicable people of all religions.I can only say that you would be doing yourself a disfavor by not reading this excellent literary masterpiece. So try to get your hands on one and read it all the way through. You will love it!
5,Should Have Been a Hit,"I don't know what more you could say about John Waites distinct voice. He sings rock like nobodys business. Ballads? You bet. I spent many summer days driving around, windows down, and this little gem of a cd cranked. This cd is a little tighter than the first. Song writing a little more focused. The first almost felt like it was pieced together from different cds. It's been a long time since I bought a cd I could listen to all the way through and not get bored. They definitely left us on a high note. This cd, and others like it are why I don't listen to radio any more. Get a mind of your own and buy this cd. It's worth it. Take it from David Bowie...""I am the DJ, I am what I play"""
5,"Bad English's ""Backlash""","John Waite on vocals, Neal Schon on guitar, and Jonathan Cain on keyboards.....it doesn't get better. John Waite and Neal Schon belong playing together. The only bad part of this CD is that it was their last work together. ""Straight to Your Heart"" gets you rockin', then ""Time Stood Still"" & ""The Time Alone With You"" shows off John's voice and writing ability. ""Savage Blue"", ""Pray For Rain"" and ""Make Love Last"" round out a fabulous album."
2,I hate to disagree but....,"This second, and last album, by Bad English comes across as tame and generic. There aren't any tunes that hit you like a lot of the stuff from the first cd did. The only two songs that stuck in my head were ""Time alone with you"" and ""Straight to your heart."" Everything else is really faceless and sounds like b-sides from the first album. The songwriting isn't bad, the lyrics are well done, but the rhythm section lacks punch and the songs are mostly forgettable. I found myself skipping over a lot of tracks. Start with the first album or check out the far superior bands that these gentlemen were involved with: Journey, The Baby's, Hardline, John Waite (solo), Soul Sirkus, etc."
2,Not Good English,"The follow-up to their debut release is really kinda ""eh."" A few songs are okay - Straight At Your Heart and Time Stood Still are decent. Other songs are OK, but nothing really great in this one.Their first release is better, try that one if you have the need for Bad English. Or better yet, get the Babys Anthology - now that's some good John Waite powered tunes!"
5,A Great Comprehensive Book,"I first picked up this book under the age of ten. Since then, I must have read it two or three more times, purchased several copies to give to friends and family, and recommended it as a primary textbook for Islamic curriculums. The author Ghulam Sarwar does a great job of summarizing all the essentials - a great read for anyone interested in the religion or someone looking to expand their own interest in their religion. There's nothing in there to disagree with - highly debated issues are simply omitted. He leaves that for other books. 5 stars."
5,visionary prophet daniel,I recommend Tarot Basics definitely for the Beginning Tarot Initiate for its clarity of meanings for each of the major/minor arcana cards and the three different decks in the book. This actually gives the Beginner first sensitivity to each of the images of each of the decks. 3 of the decks are Crowley's Book Of Thoth;Rider-Waite; and The Marseilles decks(one is in the book and the other is the 78 card deck in the set which is a collage interpretation of this classic deck.) I have tested the deck provided as I am very familiar with Marseilles Deck by 1000's of readings to be very comfotable with this deck in at least 4 spreads..
1,Not to promising,"I really didn't garnish a single bit of information from this book. It has almost nothing to do with the fundamentals of traditional tarot, and fails to offer up some kind of unique alternative. I read this entire book cover to cover and came away knowing just about what i started with before i opened it: Nothing.This book is an attempt to introduce a new-age appeal to tarot and drag it away from it's ""fortune-teller"" (as the book describes it) roots, Basing the reading souly on a persons psychological reaction to the card instead of the traditional teachings of energy & spirit.If you want to learn tarot, don't buy this book. Get Learning the Tarot or goto the website of the same name. This book is useless, tries to fraud the essence of tarot, and doesn't even properly explain the point it's trying to convey. Avoid it and if you accidentally get to close, walk, don't run, away."
3,Good introduction to Tarot,"This was given to me as a gift set by my father. They go with the popular yellow press hype that Crowley was a black magician. They comment that his interpretation of Tarot is still valid; nonetheless, such a claim (ad hominem) doesn't really help anyone seeking quality material, as any man in his personal life is not equivalent to his public or work life. Perhaps it is not so unfortunate then, as anyone who reads Tarot is going to be seen as a Satanist anyway. And this read does open up choices for Tarot and gives three explanations for each card - Arthur-Waite, Thoth and their own. I also like that the cards are longer and not as wide as others. The artwork is ok - a good practice deck. You'll have to look up whatever paraphrases are out there for the minor arcana (for example, 5 of pentacles = financial strife...5 of anything is usually strife of whatever element it is), and/or you can create your own."
3,"too small, too flat","I'm returning it because it is too small in every direction and too square/flat.Well made, nice color (plum) not bright, but deep and grounded :)I'll order a larger round one."
3,I wanna walk Dave Bartholomew home.,"This is a decent live recording of Fats Domino in concert. Fats still sounds about the same as he did in his heyday. It's a short recording (only 28 minutes long). The track listing here is wrong, here is the correct track listing:1. Blueberry Hill2. I'm Walkin'3. I'm Gonna Be a Wheel Someday4. Whole Lotta Loving5. I Want to Walk You Home6. Kansas City7. Blue Monday8. I'm Ready9. Ain't That a Shame10. My Blue Heaven11. Walking to New Orleans12. I'm in Love Again"
1,Disappointed!!,"After reading ""The Church Ladies"", I was very excited to read another book by Lisa Samson. I wish it hadn't been ""Songbird"". I did not enjoy this book at all. It was very depressing and sad. The Eiplogue was perhaps a small bright spot but overall I was very disappointed. The book was a little long and when a little happiness came along in the book, it would be immediately overshadowed by another bad event in Charmaine's life. This book was just not for me."
5,Heartwarming!,"This book is completely unlike the usual lightweight Christian fiction I've encountered before now. Myrtle Charmaine is like a member of your family by the first page. And, in spite of the heavy subject matter, Charmaine's joy in life shines through the pages of the book in a wonderfully inspiring way. I loved this book!"
4,So colorful it was made for the big screen!,"Myrtle Charmaine is only 11 when her mother leaves her to fend for herself. Years of moving from state to state leave Charmaine longing for a place to call home. Yet, she marries a traveling preacher. Harlan encourages her in her gospel music, the stray children she accumulates, and the search for her mother. However, Harlan's anti-psychiatry messages prompt Charmaine to keep some secrets from him.Jump on the RV and join Harlan and Charmaine as they travel church to church spreading the gospel, great music, and love. These are genuine characters that will linger in your thoughts long after the last page."
5,Civ Pro's Bosom Buddy = Joseph Glannan,"If you're taking Civ Pro, then you need this book. And that is all that needs to be said."
4,Professor-recommended study aid,"This is an excellent exam aid for the student who has already put in at least some of the work of studying during the semester but wants to sharpen up in preparation for finals. It is not a quick-and-ready, black letter law outline. It provides thoughtful, accessible analysis of the significant areas of civpro and then provides excellent short essay questions and answers.This book is best at helping you practice the analysis necessary for perfoming well on essay exams. It is the only study aid my civpro professor recommends, and it helped me secure A's both semesters."
5,Simplifies an inherently complex class,"This book was the only reason I got through Civ Pro. It takes the complex concepts and breaks them up into bite-sized examples and questions for which there are thorough explanations. I highly recommend all the E&E books because they clarify, in my experience, all concepts and make the subject understandable. Additionally if you read this before you actually cover the particular concept in class you always look like you have a firm grasp on the subject, which may or may not be the truth."
4,Very Helpful,"This is an essential supplement if you are going to understand this God-forsaken subject. I took off a star because there are some important subjects that are not covered in the book for some reason (For example, there is very little on Rule 24)"
5,Joe Glannon in my Civ Pro boyfriend,"I remember this book well from my days as a 1L. You MUST have this book--Civ Pro is a web of rules, and using them wisely is crucial to being an effective litigator. I aced Civ Pro and ended up on Law Review and I always swore I'd write a love letter to Joe Glannon to show my gratitude. Well, consider this review my love letter, Prof. Glannon. This book is a must-have."
4,One of the best study guides; an absolute MUST for 1L's!,"For those law students who are having difficulty comprehending the abstract world of Civil Procedure, this book is incredibly helpful. Glannon has a very simple way of explaining concepts in just a few sentences. After reading Glannon's study guide, I was able to follow what the professor was trying to explain in class. Suddenly, it seemed so very easy to understand! There is also one other element which is the reason that I highly recommend this book over any other Civil Procedure Outline: at the end of each section, there are questions FOLLOWED BY EXPLANATIONS! This important ""anti-socratic method"" feature allows you to find out if you really understood what you just read. Amazing!"
5,This book saved me,Having to take Civ Pro from a first year professor is a nightmare. Having to learn Civ Pro at the same time your professor appears to be learning Civ Pro is even worse. Mr. Glannon basically made this somewhat mystifying subject (that really isn't that bad if someone can actually teach it) much much easier.
5,Great like all other 1L E & Es,Buy this and High Court summaries keyed to your casebook and you're set. I also used the Gilberts and Sum and Substance 1L tapes while commuting to school--the best preparation with the least effort. AWESOME!
5,this should be your civ pro bible,"If you are taking Civil Procedure, this book should be your Bible. Period."
2,Civil Procedure,"The product arrived timely. However, the book had been advertised with light highlighting. I know descriptions like this are subjective, however, I think the seller took some liberties."
5,The BEST Civ Pro study guide available,"Listen up ALL 1L's: All the hype is ABSOLUTELY true about this book-- it was invaluable as a supplement to my Civ Pro course which I ACED! Thank you, Mr. Glannon, for writing such clear and concise explanations of some of the most complex issues I have ever dealt with. The chapter called ""Hard Erie"" is worth the price of the text alone. Do yourself a favor and if you buy no other study guides buy THIS one!"
2,THIS IS A SILLY ALBUM!,"This album does not really swing. Whoever produced it, needs to listen to some Count Basie, Benny Goodman etc. not to a bunch of rockabillies wanna be swing musicians.The songs are good; that's about it."
4,Fun and upbeat,"A great translation of old favorites, hard to sit and listen to, you want to get up and dance like David!"
5,The best Christian swing CD I've heard,Swing praise turns what used to be slow hymn songs into fantastic swinging rhythms. I've listened to this awesome CD time and time again and still love it. Swing praise has great lyrics put to a swing beat that will have you singing in no time.
2,concerning the restore disk,i found out the same results you cant use your media restore disc but i did foind out you can get the full system restore disc fom sony its a two dvd set for $17.99 plus tax and shippingremeber to refer to the model number pcv rz36g its still available
3,"Boring Beginning, Good Ending",I'm a little mixed about this book. It was really hard for me to get into the first half of this. It just seemed to trudge around with no real direction for a really long time. It also doesn't help that the Susannah/Mia/Chap story is my least favorite in the series. What makes me feel mixed about this is that the last half does pick up some and there are some interesting additions to the story that are leading up the the final climax of the series. All around it was decent but the first half of the book just leaves a sour taste in my mouth.
4,Stephen King books,If you love Stephen King & the Gunslinger series this book is for you! Good price too!
4,Quick read,"I found I blew through this book in the Dark Tower series... maybe because I felt the end was nigh ;). It isn't quite as action-packed or thoughtful as some of the others, but it wasn't the worst either. Short book but you have to get it to finish the series."
2,Have the baby already,"This baby must have taken more than 9 months to pop. It at least felt like 2 to 3 years. What is up with the characters meeting King. Is that corny or what? That seems like something you would find in a kids chapter book. This book seemed a little forced, like the story didn't come to King quite like it should have and he just threw what came to his mind on the page."
2,Disappointing,"I've been a fan of this series for years and until Book V, they seemed to be getting better and better. Book V was decent, but somehow not on par with the rest of the series. Mediocre is the best word to describe it. Book VI (The Song of Susannah) is just plain bad. The biggest problem is that it is very short compared to the others (except book I). The decision to write himself into the series has really mucked everything up, but it might have been smoothed over with an additional 400 pages of text. This book feels rushed and disorganized. There are several plot points that seem be going in several different directions and serve only to distract the reader. While the plot content of this book is disappointing, my biggest disappointment is that this book takes place mostly in New York and Maine. That takes alot of the magic out of the story. I enjoy the series mainly because it focuses on other worlds. I haven't lost faith for Book VII yet, but I'm definitely worried at this point."
5,All Things Serve the Beam,"I loved this book. I thought that inserting himself as a character was absolutely BRILLIANT. These books are all about the spaces between the worlds getting thin, and I think this serves that concept well.I like Jake and Oy. When Oy started crying at losing Jake I about lost it myself!And although I have never read Salem's Lot--I'm not a fan of vampires--Pere Callahan is a great character. I loved his adventures thru ""America"".I highly recommend this and all the Dark Tower books. I can't wait to read book VII.It was a wonderful gift from God that Steve King dodged the Todana and lived to write the last 3 books of the series.Long days and pleasant nights to you, Sai King."
2,Oh what a waste,"King works better in Roland's world than in ours. I find his stories in those other worlds so much more interesting than when they cross over into ours. It has lost its appeal and this book feels forced. I think King was driven to finish the series and really did not know where to go. Once he wrote himself into the book I lost all sense of fantasy/unreality that made the other books so interesting. Lets hope his finale has some heart and depth. I've come this far so I will see how it ends, but I think this time I'll check it out from the library rather than purchase it."
1,You Ain't God,Ok Stephen King decides to write a story where it is revealed that he is God and the future of the universe depends on him continuing his miserable existence as an egocentric maniac. Sorry for the spoiler but that pretty much sums up the whole book. In short 'Song of Susannah' is awful. Roland and Eddie meet God and shiver before him. Stephen King reveals he has powers and awes the Gunslingers. This book is so stupid I wish I could give it negative stars. I don't know why an author would choose to do something of this nature unless they were just lazy or really into themselves. Sorry Mr King you are not God.
1,not happy,I did not want to rate it one star even but the program would not let me leave it unanswered. I used the used book option for the first time and still have not even been notified that it has shipped. It was supposed to ship in 2-3 days according to the advertisement. Still not shipped. I might cancel the order later today if it is not shipped.
2,Isn't anyone else disturbed by where Black Thirteen is???,"First, I'll say this was better than DT 5. SK writing himself into the story was a bit weird, but considering the idea, it was executed ok. SOS, like WOTC, does not measure up to the first 4 Dark Tower books. I am a HUGE fan of the Dark Tower series and of Stephen King in general. I think it is then safe to say I am not offended by much and usually find King's stories quite enjoyable. Having said that, King has made an oblique reference to a huge American tragedy by where he's stashed Black Thirteen in this book. This already is crass but if he continues down this storyline in DT 7 it will be the most tasteless, insensitive, idiotic thing any author has ever done. Don't do it, Stephen. If you want Constant Reader to keep respecting your work, don't do it."
1,The worst Stephen King book ever,"I don't think I have ever been so disappointed with a book. I was expecting a ""Return of the King"" epic finish to this series I have loved and longed for completion. Instead I received a disjointed, incomplete, schizophrenic tale that answers few questions or gets us any closer to the Black Tower. I think it would have been better to leave the series unfinished than conclude with this poorly written, weak ending. I may not even even read the last book. PS: I think King's writing journal at the end of the book is pathetic. Does he want us to feel sorry for him? One thing is quite correct though -- his career ended when he was hit by that truck. He hasn't writing a decent sentence since."
2,At least King reveals why DT became a TOTAL PIECE OF CRAP,"Making himself as a character in his novel was a little intriguing but not enough to save this inane drivel.Did you notice that the character representing him said that he had an outline of the DT series once but lost it? I think King has REALLY lost it. I don't understand why everyone else cannot see that King is just cashing in.SK is famous for once writing a 350 page book in ten days. If he spent ten days on this book, it he must have written it during commercials.His character in the story said that he ""writes from the navel"". I believe it. He certainly doesn't use a brain or an editor.Now if I can only figure out why I couldn't put the damn thing down."
3,got them for my nephew,"My nephew loves the Dark Tower, he has been reading them and this is an addition to the whole series. I got them for him."
3,Decent continuation,I love the Dark Tower series too death but this book just isn't up to the bar that the first 4 books set. That being said I did enjoy it and look for to a conclusion of Roland's tale.
4,THE SERIES,I HAVE PURCHASED THE WHOLE SERIES FOR MY HUSBAND AS GIFTS AND HE LOVES THIS SERIES. IF YOU CAN STAY FOCUSED ON THIS MANY BOOKS I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.
4,It's good...,"I want to start off by saying this, in my opinion, isn't as bad as most people say. It certainly isn't the best in the cycle, but as someone else so cleverly said, it had to be written.While the ending was a cliffhanger, It really isn't the biggest in the Dark Tower cycle, or at least that's how I felt. I thought the biggest suprise came when the reader learned the facts about Susannah's baby.As for writing himself into the story, I think King did a fine job of it, and don't think it was such a terrible idea. It has poetential (although it seems his part in it may be over) to develop into something intersting.All in all, it's a good, fairly quick read, and it should hold most fans over until September."
5,THE DARK TOWER REIGNS SUPREME,This was an excellent book. A bit corny about Stephen King putting himself in the story -- but still amazing. Can't wait for #7. I've been following the series from the beginning and I'm so excited about finally reading the conculsion.
3,what happened,"seriously, what happened to Roland being a badass. He's cracking lame jokes in Wolves, now he's getting all emotional over meeting SK, its not cool. The book feels like a lot less than it was supposed to be and it makes me mad to see potentially the greatest character King ever created be corrupted and weakened, though I know many of you will disagree and cite Roland's newfound relationships as part of his growing into someone else. i don't know where King went wrong, but this book just didn't feel right to me."
2,King slacks off,"I have much respect for King and most of his work. However, it seems to me, that King has taken the easy way out of what could have been an epic tale. In DT VI, King begins to (without much care or reason) tie up loose ends. While I will read his other DT books when they are released, my expectations are low, based on what King has done in this book."
1,Dreck commala,"Cry your pardon, Steve, but....Commala-com-beck,Really, what the heck?The DT series was so sublime...But now you give us dreck."
2,If I read the word chap one more time....,"What a stinker. This book had only a few scant good parts and all the rest were well, not good parts. The parts with Susannah and her litany of personalities just wore me down. I don't want to spend 300 pages in someone's head. The Gunslinger and Eddie had some nice scenes, but that was it. You can't skip this book either, although you could probably skim over it. I will read book 7, I've come this far, but if it reads like this one, it will be tough to get through."
2,Boring baby-mama drama,"This book is by far the most boring, least interesting, and least active of the first 6 dark tower books. I have yet to read 7 or the prequel so they may be worse. I don't want to give away any plot but suffice to say this story is a major slow down in pace from Wolves of the Calla. I also don't like the way they break the fourth wall."
4,"Good, but not the same as the 1st four DT books","I again enjoyed the continuing adventures of the ka-tet of Roland, Eddie, Susannah, and Jake and the characters they meet along the way to the Dark Tower. I particularly enjoyed the author's diary/journel notes at the end."
5,Wow!,"I read this book in a couple of hours; I couldn't put it down! I love the way SK is bringing together his other works in his magnum opus. I found references to several other books/stories, which made it more interesting to me. (I like to see that these other stories live on). I won't spoil this for anyone, but if you have enjoyed the previous DT books, this is a must."
3,"Song Of Susannah (The Dark Tower, Book 6)","This was not my favorite of the Dark Tower series. LOVE the series however, but this seemed to me to be a little more reaching for additional content. I am a HUGE fan of Stephen King. This series is well worth the read. I simply wasn't as impressed by this particular book in the series."
3,"Good, but Average compared to the series","I found this book somewhat average compared to the rest of the series. In particular, I wasn't too thrilled with the whole ""SK"" thing. It felt somewhat cutsy to me, and yanked me completely out of the narrative. So, my issue is with the style, not the execution, of the plot in this book.That being said, the book is an integral part of the series, moves the story in many compelling ways, and I consider it an enjoyable must-read."
4,Song of Susannah Review,"This the 6th book in the Dark Tower series is just as expected; familiar characters working through bizzare situations. In the beginning I thought this book would be all about the multiples of Susannah, Mia, etc. But just when I started getting tired of the ""chap"" the story shifts and takes an exciting turn with a rousing shoot out. I see this as the build up for Book 7 which I can't wait to read."
4,"Audio Book 6 of 7, Join the Journey!","Like the previous books, have VII ready, the story of course is NOT complete and you want to have ready Disc 1 of the 7th book. This is a shorter Audio with half the cds of the previous books, but it regained the ""action"" of the second book. No more wondering about the past or someone else's life, the journey finally continues. And hold on for the ride! I really enjoyed this one.The ending however, as mentioned in many other reviews, bothers me (the reason for 4 stars). The end of disk 11 and ALL of disc 12 are author notes. The book is taking a turn (on disk 11) that (in my mind) could have gone in a different way, (SPOILER ALERT!) Mr. King decided to include himself in the book. Maybe this is how he feels about these books, like they are a part of him and therefore he belongs in them, but we are so passionate about these characters that he seems like an intruder."
4,Much ado about nothing,"King builds up over 300 pages of anticipation for a cliffhanger more artificially staged than a season finale of Friends. The story was much more engaging than Wizard and Glass but if you're going to focus your entire book on the occurence of a single event, there has to be some follow through at the end. If you hate feeling cheated at the end of a book because the built up suspense isn't resolved, I recommend waiting until Book 7 comes out so you can read 6 and 7 together."
2,Dark Tower #6 or Dark Dud?,"Two things shaped my formative years. Star Wars and The Dark Tower. Sadly, the latest installment of the epic Dark Tower series leaves me longing for the early days (ie The Gunslinger through The Wastelands). Susannah and Dark Thirteen have slipped into New York City in 1999 with Mia's chap ready to make his grand appearance. Our heros Ronald, Eddie, Jake and Oy along with Father Callahan try to follow her. Will Mia's chap be the beginning of the end? Will you get through the end without wanting to shake Calvin Tower until his teeth rattle? The best part of novel? The part I feared the most, the entrance of S. King, Esquire into the narrative. Shan't reveal too many details but his presence in the last novels may not be the devastation that so many fear."
2,Yuck,"I'm a huge Stephen King fan - but not enough to be blinded by the sad fact that Song of Susannah has to be one of King's WORST books. Nothing really happens in it - in fact, you could probably skip it altogether and simply read Book 7 when it comes out later this fall and really not miss anything.I also don't how overindulgent King is becoming about himself in this series. Writing himself into the series is a disaster and the only reason he can get away with it is because he's Stephen King. I would prefer to hear more about Roland and his past - I already know quite a bit about Stephen King's life story from A&E's Biography, thank you very much.One is left wondering what direction the Tower series would have taken had King never had his accident in '99 - certainly a better one than it seems to be heading in now."
4,Just one more,"I'm not going to review this book, because it is not fair, If something should be review it must be the whole story of the Dark Tower. The Dark Tower is one or maybe the best of all the sagas out there, actually it as breathtaking as The lord of the Rings"
4,King is well the King,"King is the paragon of authors of this generation. Although Grisham and now Rowling might have sold more copies.The only negative about this work is that you really need to have read the whole series to get it all.So before you read this book, read the first six.Long live the King"
2,tiresome drudgery,"This was painful. I just wanted to get through it. Boring, silly, egotistic and just....bad. If I hear the word ""chap"" one more time, I'm going to freak out. I'm listening to it now..oh god, please let it end. Kill me"
2,Song of Susannah,A little bit of an ego trip for the author. This book in the dark tower series just gets a little too bizarre when the author starts including himself in the story. I liked this one the least of the first 6 books. Hopefully book 7 will pull away from this latest theme.
2,hmm. A bit gimmicky without pushing the plot along,"Writing himself in (seeming as an excuse to complain about his fans for thinking they should have affordable access to his work) seemed a little gimmicky. Though you can tell just how much his near death experience (the hit and run in '99) really affected him by reading this book, I couldn't say that Song of Susannah really advanced the plot of the Dark Tower series at all.It was a moderately enjoyable read, but one worth waiting for paperback."
4,"Pretty Good, But...","I found this book to be the weakest of the Dark Tower books. Susannah is not a particularly endearing character. It felt like this book could have been reduced to 50 pages and just added on to the previous book. This book only sets up the last book. However, in typical Dark Tower fasion it is an enjoyable read. And, it does leave you wanting to find out what happens in the next book.This is not a book you can pick up if you haven't read the rest, but it is also not one you can skip if you want to read the final one."
2,After giving this book a while to grow on me....SPOILERS in review!,"SPOILERS BELOWI still don't like this book or the direction king took the series after the 4th book. The 5th book was decent and kept me into it throughout, but with the finding of the king novel ""Salem's Lot"" i was afraid of where he was going. This book goes there i'm afraid. I still don't get why King put himself in the books. What complicates matters even worse is the fact that the 5th and 6th books should have been combined...at least in my opinion because they seem so much shorter than the first 4 and the 7th. However, if you've made it this far in the series you should finish it. I personally liked the ending of the 7th book but the 5th and 6th books were pretty terrible. Heck even the 7th could have been so much better."
3,"Not the best DT book, but at least it is short!","Song of Susannah is my least favorite book in the DT series. Thankfully it is short and reads very quickly. Song contains vital information that the reader will need to complete the DT series, and one must assume if they have already read books 1-5 that the reader is committed to completing the series. Song is not a bad story, it just doesn't really seem to have much relevance to the DT saga, it is more of an aside then tied to the main plot."
3,Good series...not so good installment,"This book could easily be removed from the series. After reading the previous books, although there were some points of interest, book 6 was somewhat of a let down. Read it for continuity if you are reading the series, but don't expect too much."
3,Is Stephen King Scared??,"Overall the book was O.K. at best. It gave alot of information about the Dark Tower itself and how everything works, but is this the best plot King can come up with? I just feel that he could do so much more. King seems scared that he weren't going to finish the series and wrote it off quickly. I mean writing Callahan into the story is one thing but writing himself into it as an instument of gahn (God) is another. I have not read the last book yet so just maybe he can pull it off with out leaving me disapointed (I dont see how!). Although, he is KING, and he hasnt disapointed me in a book yet."
4,DOESN'T BEAT CALLA FOR STORY CONTENT,"In the second to last installment of the Dark Tower series, #6 is not as tight, nor as interesting as #5. In this episode Susannah/Mia is tasked to deliver her baby and we find the child will become the Crimson King and is Roland's son. Its a little confusing, but that's the deal. This tome is shorter and painted with as broad stripes as WOLVES OF THE CALLA. King has written himself into the narrative as the writer/god of all that is occurring. Everything seems to flow from him and he is paid a visit by Eddie and Roland. This aspect, a writer putting himself in the narrative, is usually my most hated device, but I actually enjoyed King's involvement in the story and I expect him to take a role in #7 which I have just dived into."
5,All I can say is Wow,"I have been been a huge Stephen King fan since I was 15. The Dark Tower series has been tied into a majority of his stories. After reading this book I just couldn't speak. It took me 2 days to read this book, I just couldn't put it down. The only time that I could was after the part where he wrote himself in. I needed to smoke 2 cigarettes to normalize myself. I recommend that everyone read this and the rest of the Dark Tower books. This is truly a wonderful series and once you get sucked in you will yearn for book 7. Only 3 months and 3 days til the next one."
2,Hmm...,"As I was reading the coda at the end of the book, I read one part where King talked about other authors whose books are ruined by character pregnancies. Too bad he didn't take this wisdom to heart. I was so tired of this book I could barely wait to put it down. Enough already with Mia and the stupid baby. The entire pregnancy sidetracked Roland's interesting quest. I loved the Wastelands where King really drew a clear picture of Roland's world, and the way he painted the history of it in Wizard and Glass.King being in this book seemed so stupid. I felt like I was reading the book version of The Neverending story or something. And whoever mentioned the rhyming at the end of every chapter was dead on...it was horrible."
1,I know why this book was 14$,"I should of listened to all the other reviews.I told myself it could not be as bad as people stated.And at a staggering 14$ Kindle price tag? REALLY?The reason the book is priced so high, is that it really really is just horrible. ( AND NOT ONE WANTS TO BUY IT )I am so in love with the detail of all the characters, and then Stephen King actually produces this book?The book is bearable through the first half of the book, Then towards the last of 60 percent the book just becomes so horribly awful I am upset that I have to finish it to get to the last book.I am seriously scared for the last book now, with the fact that they even make people pay for this excuse for a short series novel.PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF YOUR POCKET BOOK DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOKSave your money and go see a movie, eat at McDonald's, it will be better spent."
1,Worst Stephen King book ever... Painfully bad,"The first four books in this series was pretty good. But the last three is utterly garbage. It's written like Stephen King took a bunch of other books from his book shelf and stuck it in a blender. It's REALLY REALLY BAD and BORING. I invested too much time in the first 4 books so I felt I had to finish off the series. But it was soooo painful getting through these last 3 book. IMHO, my advice to is to just skip this series all together, it's not worth having to get through the last 3 books especially this one. This was Stephen King's scariest book for sure.. scary how BAD it was."
1,Song of Susannah,I purchased 4 audio books of Song of Susannah and returned each one. Each one contained two # 1 disc and no # 2 disc. I would love to have a complete set as I am anxious to finish The Dark Tower series.
4,good!,"It was a really good read! Since it wasn't as thick as the others, I finished it quickly and was able to start The Dark Tower a few days later. :)"
1,Can I get my money back,"I just like a good story which most of the Dark Tower series has been but this story feels like I was just ripped off.In the great Stephen King Book, Misery, the author was forced to rewrite the story because he let a fan down. Well, this fan was let down with the ""Song of Susannah"" and if I had the power would have Mr. King rewrite the second half of the book, starting where he introduces himself into the story. It's a given that this book is a must read for anyone that has been reading the series (like we can stop now) but I just expected more. I hope the last book makes up for this dissapointment."
1,Danger signs!,"Yes, Danger signs. When you hear the creator of a series state;""I had to Force myself to sit down and write."". (Both George Lucas and Stephen King said exactly that). This is the garbage that rest assured will follow.We had two examples of bad / forced writing in movies, ""The Phantom Jar-Jar"" and ""Clone Wars"". Not to be out done, Stephen delivers three examples in Book form;""Wolves of the Calla"", ""Song of Susannah"", and now ""The Dark Tower"".Both Lucas and King have now turned exceptional series's into the worst fans could have imagined.Steve-o, you were doing great up till ""Wizard and Glass"", I was even willing to forgive and forget that ""OZ"" sequence, but this is unforgivable trash."
4,New book,"Survived shipping in perfect condition. Good looking cover with crisp type and fine story illustration throughout the book. Story however is bogging down after first there books, they were page turners for me. To bad he waited so long to resume the story, It was a disservice to himself and his readers."
5,Great Book~!!,It's a good read and I've almost finished it without realizing how fast I was reading it. I would reccomend it.
5,Stephen King is amazing!,"This is my second time through the series, and it is still wonderful.Wish they would make a movie series about it.Love King!"
5,A whirlwind of deep and introspective adventure.,"With this, the sixth novel in his epic, Stephen King is setting his readers up for a spectacular finale.I will restrain myself from saying more, for I suspect that anything I could say would give away one of many vital plot points. Let's just say that Stephen King seems to be exorcising some demons, some his own and some that haunt all of us, with this series."
4,Rolling on to conclusion,"This was a fun read. I don't think it will make much sense if you haven't been through the Dark Tower series so far, but for those of us who have made the journey, this is definitely a step forward. It was less structured than some of the previous books in the series, but you can feel the build up to the coming finale."
2,The weakest book in the series,It just seems like nothing really happened in this book. King could have left it out altogether. A book about the Crimson King would have been a netter idea. But... you're gonna read the whole series so you're gonna read this book regardless or what I write.
3,Sadly I must agree,"""He rushed too much when writing these last three books. If he had taken his time like he did the first 4, they would all be quality. But, realistically, if he took his time like the first four he would never finish. The car crash has already showed us that King may not have much time left, as grim as that sounds.""Like David Gerrold of the ""Invasion of the Chtorr"" Series, King screwed around with a story that could have been EPIC. The first 4 books were AWESOME. Then he took a vacation, and feebly tried to pick up where he left off. Im glad Ill be able to finish the series, but King should have taken his time and done it right. I have a sinking feeling he is going to do the old Hollywood ""tie it all together in the last ten minutes"" scenario. Roland deserves better...Shame on you Mr. King..."
2,Feeling Cheated,"Having been a rabid Stephen King fan for years, (the Dark Tower series and related books in particular) I was disappointed with ""Song of Sushannah"" for three reasons. First, the quality of the writing was not up to the usual high King standards. Second, the plot dragged, and in places, seemed not to make any sense. It seems to me that Mr. King, for whatever reason, just got lazy. Third, the insertion of the author himself into the story was self serving and unnecessary. Still, I am waitingwith much anticipation to see if the Beams hold true and the Tower remains standing. I fervently hope (and believe) that ""Song of Sushahannah"" is an aberration in an otherwise flawless and moving story."
2,Disappointing,"Song of Susannah is little more than a short story expanded out with a lot of confusing and ultimately senseless flashbacks into something that could be sold as a full novel. There's no denying King's ability to hold a reader's interest even when he isn't saying anything worth reading, but still, be fair to the reader. This could have been written in 50 pages. And ultimately, it has the feel of being a bit of a ripoff of Rosemary's Baby (the movie).Wait for the paperback if you must read it. Hope Mr. King does a heap better with the next (and final) book of the series."
1,Just not worth it,"What a disappointment. This book was filler. Had I known, I would have simply waited and just read the final book."
1,"1 Star for the Price, not the content! $13.99? Are you kidding me?!","Open letter to Simon and Schuster Digital Sales Inc:$13.99 for Song of Susannah for my Kindle? Really?! Please allow me to point out to you that the 2 books that are on either side of Mr King's Dark Tower series, Wolves of the Calla and The Dark Tower, are both $9.99 and are 960 & 1072 pages in length. Song of Susannah is only 560 pages.Why the price gouging? Why the inconsistency in price? It's ludicrous. Yes, I get that it's one of the 3 books of this series Mr King released in the last decade. But, really, $4 more than the other 2 for half the page count? Really? That's just insulting. And greedy. Please adjust your price, Simon and Schuster Digital Services Inc, to a more reasonable $9.99 & keep it with the other 3. (And $9.99 is bad enough for a nearly 10 year old book in electronic form!)I guess I'll have to borrow this one if I want to finish the series. Because I'm NOT going to buy it until the price drops."
3,Good book - King's EGO is probably on last floor of Tower !,"This book was a very good read. The story moved smoothly along.Roland sent Jake and Father Callahan to rescue Susanna whilehe and Eddie went to find their creator. No problem so far. However, I have never heard of an author putting himself intohis own story the way Stephen King has done. It probably has beendone. I just haven't heard of it. It smacks of egotism to the extreme (especially elevating himself to a God). The boring coda at the end of the book was especially nausiating. As a whole, though, the book was entertaining and that is why I am giving it a n above average score."
2,Just Get to the dark tower already!!,"Stephen King makes the awful mistake of author insertion in this story. So, he either completely typed himself out of ideas, or was very bored. I started out being very intrigued by this series, but he's dragged it out too long with unnesscary side trips."
1,Weak.,"Lucky for me, I just started reading this series in May. I have not wasted years of my life waiting for the next installment to arrive, and I was able to see the gradual weakening of the plot through the last few books very quickly (culminating in the total failure of the story in SOS.) Please give us something better in the 7th book, ""Steve"" - don't have your dead self rise as the Crimson King or some other drivel. To all of you who have been reading this series for years, ""Steve"" should cry your pardon for such a sorry book."
1,WHAT?! What have you DONE?!,"My friend Dave said it best,""Dad-a-bum Dad-a-bus, Stephen King thinks very lowly of us. Dad-a-chum Dad-a-chack, DT7 can wait for paperback."" I am without words to describe what a mess this book is. Wolves was just as awful, but this hurts more, because I sense there is no hope for DT7. Read it or not. Just know that you are really going to hate hearing the words,"" Roland of Gilead, Son of Stephen."" I am glad SK has sobered up, though. No matter how it effected his works."
4,A truly great series continues,"Not generally associated with fantasy, Stephen King is authoring one of the best series in the genre. The Dark Tower series is like a breath of fresh air to those of us who sometimes tire of the typical plots and devices found in other works of fantasy.I enjoyed reading The Song of Susannah, though only the next installment will tell if this book was an unnecessary detour or an integral part of the overall plot. Knowing King, I suspect that the latter will be the case. King's addition of himself as a character (hinted at in the previous volume) seemed a bit vain at first. But after deeper consideration, it seems to me that King is challenging the very notion of reality by becoming an unwilling participant in his own story.Whether you're a fantasy reader or a Stephen King fan, I would highly recommend this entire series."
5,Mama was right...,"Mom said years ago that Stephen King's stories felt like they were being told through him, not by him. I always thought that her description was oddly perfect. Now comes Song of Susannah, and we find out Mama was right all along.This novel is a story told at multiple levels at multiple times across many worlds. It is a beautiful work of art although it cannot stand alone -- you have to have the other Beams to hold it up, one might say, so read the series in order before beginning this one.SK writes himself into the story and makes it work. He does it so well that I was more spooked by this idea than any of his monsters from any of his books. Because all monsters from all books could be right around the corner, you see.So pull the curtains and turn the lights on. Make some tea and boil some water, because Mia's having her baby and we're all going along for the ride."
2,These books are getting worse and worse as the story goes along...,"Honestly, I think the whole book could have been about 1/5th the size and probably been a good read. The whole series just gets more painful at each book. I'm reading them only because I want to get to the end. This one was the least enjoyable of the series by far."
5,Stephen King is Brilliant,"This book -- in fact, this whole series, is compelling. Grips you from the beginning and takes you on a wonderful adventure."
3,"A little draggy, not as good as the others","I did not enjoy this book as much as the others in this series. It was still an OK read, it just didn't seem as developed or flow as smoothly as the others in the series."
2,Has S. King become possessed by a hack writer?,"His past stories have been so brillant and entertaining, but this book and Wolves of Calla are fine examples of boring tripe by an author that apparentely doesn't believe in trying too hard. His appearance in his own story was a distraction from what used to be the entertaining plot line. He should just mug me on the street if he wants my money that badly."
4,"Great, fast-paced with Poor Ending","This volume of the Dark Tower series is far more interesting and readable than Wolves of the Calla. The insertion of the author is both intrusive (King acting as his own deus ex machina) and thought-provoking (tieing in with the concept of many different worlds and acting as a commentary on the author as creator). The real disappointment is the ending, where Susannah-Mia find themselves in a ""Rosemary's Baby"" type scenario which is way too silly and overly dramatic. King knows that the last novel is going to be judged with a keen eye; let's hope he doesn't go too far and let things get out of hand."
2,Wizard and Glass was the last,"True, I do have to read part 7 still, but part 5 & 6 were very poorly done in my opinion. First of all, it's obvious that the reason for the failure in 5 and 6 is that the gunslingers have lost their edge. They have become parodies of themselves. In another review I saw the phrase, ""overly mannered,"" which I feel hits home. The redundant vernacular: palaver, deal in lead, come commala this, come commala that, come commala with a wiffle ball bat, so... King is fastidious with his overdone jargon that sounds sickenly hackneyed. Since when did gunslingers become such wimps? Since part 5 & 6. That's when. The repetitive symbolism gets overdone until anything having to do with a 19, dinn, or Ka, is just charred nuggets. The symbolism has lost its zest by being referred to annoyingly countless times. As another reader stated, I can't wait to finish the Tower Series, so I can feel some closure on a story that went sour."
1,Skip this book,"here i'll save you the trouble, remember where book 5 ended? you're about 1 inch from that at the end of this one. This is pure money grab filler. King wrote it to give himself a cameo i think."
1,Disappointment,"This book is simply a big disappointment.This is new to me since every dark tower book, up till now, has been absolutely terrific and stunning.This book doesn't go anywhere, the action scenes are lacking the appropriate DT energy they used to have, the plot is awkwardly written - seriously Mr. King - for someone who has been a constant reader of your books for over 10 years, I get barely 400 pages? of absolute boredom? In addition, I'd like to say it is a cheat to only distribute the last books in hardcopy!!! Why is this, to make an additional 10$ on every one of your readers?"
2,A LITTLE ANGRY,"By Stephen King including himself in this story, he takes some readers out of the imaginary world they have created in thier minds over the past several years reading these books. I have never complained much about any book, it is the author's vision take it or leave it, but with so much invested in this series it was a hard book to read. I hope the last book somehow brings the fantasy back for a worthwhile conclusion. CR. Regardless, SK Rocks!!! I reccommend almost all of his books!!!!just not this one :("
5,"Wonderful, wonderful, WONDERFUL!!!!!","Everything I was expecting and so, so, so MUCH more!! As a Dark Tower fanatic Mr. King just keeps delivering! The pace in this one is breakneck reminding me of the Drawing of the Three.The Song of Susannah is now up there with my other two favorites of the saga, The Wastelands and Wolves of the Calla.(...) ALL HAIL THE CRIMSON KING!! (...)"
2,Cheated!,Having waited in anticipation for the 6th volume of the Dark Tower - the 4th and 5th I was absolutely enthralled in - I feel cheated. I would recommend skipping to the 7th volume or at least wait until the 7th volume is out before buying this one. I know this was supposed to be the 6th with a volume following but I feel there were waay too many loose ends left untied and I would've preferred to read the 6th and 7th together. Now I have to wait 4 months to find out what happened....
3,very disapointing,"To say the very least. I think King has just set this on cruise control.I dont know but by including himself in the novel i think King made a horrible choice by putting himself in here just dont see the point? I think he should of taken more time between novels not like were not used to the wait. The other complaint i have is it was far to focused on susanah and not any of the other characters . i hope the next installment can clear up the mess king has created .If it had been longer 411 pages to short for a dark tower novel and had more of the other primary characters roland ,eddy,jake , etc.. I just thought it was far to focused on susanah/mia thing .If not for that i think it could of been up there as one of the best in the series. As it stands i think this is the worst by a lot."
4,Retirement,Loved the story. I feel the same as others that it may have been too short considering only one more is left in the series. Has anyone heard how many pages the final is going to be? Lets hope it compares to It or The Stand in size!I saw an interview with King and clarified he never said that he was retiring after the final installment. I also heard the same rumour a few years back but what he actually said was taken out of context by the reporter he says.He says that he may take a vacation/break that may last anywhere between 6 months and 5 years if I remember correctly. He stressed that he is not retiring from writing.
1,Thanks for destroying such a precious thing Mr. King,"DT was always something very special to me, well at least until Wizard and Glas (which was IMHO the start of the end). Mr. King messed totally up with ""Wolves of the Calla"", but I thought it can't get any worse....but Steven Steven...what a surprise: ""Song of Susannah"" is really a mess.With this book, King destroyed something very valuable for me!After reading DT1, 2 and 3 as a child I always hoped: ""Please Dear Mr. King, stay alive! Stay alive and write those remaining 4 parts of DT""Now as grown up I guess my wish as a child was wrong...maybe it would be better to have an incomplete but perfect piece of phantasy in your mind..."
2,almost as bad as the last,"I honestly think he should have stopped after the fourth book and should've avoid giving us the ""Wachowski feeling"" of destroying what might have been a really good and original idea...What he calls in the last book as ""methaphysics"" to explain (justify) his own presence in the book, I call it a cheap trick. Does he really have to be there? no, I don't think so, specially since he had already abused of the doors to move between worlds. Those two things just destroyed the series..."
3,Why?????,"After I read the entire book (and a little before, I might add), I was storming around the house furious that he would write himself into the book. Then I calmed down-- Stephen King knows more about writing fiction than I do-- he knew the risk he was taking by writing himself in the book.He must (better) have something big planned for the finale, or .... or..... Ah hell, I loved the first 5 so much, I don't really care.In all seriousness, the book before Roland and Eddie meet King is very good. The rest of it was just not there for me."
1,The Bitter End,"The only person I admire concerning this mess-of-a-book is ""Tabby, who knew when it was done."" Thank God, because Steven King could never find a point in his plots or seem to know when to make them end. The MOST insulting thing before making a game effort to read the drivle, is the LARGE PRINT VERSION TRANSPARENTLY DEVISED TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE ENOUGH BOOK TO CHARGE $30 FOR!!! King has been treated extremely well by his readers, but he owed it to us to quit rather than dump this sad mess on the market. Better to have a disappoited readership than a disgusted one."
2,Not very good,"I was really into this series, I didnt even mind the cliffhanger at the end of the wastelands (though the wizard of Oz business in wizard and glass got tedious...)But this whole bit of the gunslinger and eddie meeting King was too ridiculous for words.If this was any but a top flight author who has made millions on millions of dollars for his publishing house, this book would never have gotten published.I am going into the last of the series now, what the hell, I am already 6 books in, only one to go...But I dont hold very high hopes anymore....If this were a TV show it would have been cancelled, and no one would get to know how it ended.There is probly too much truth in the parts of the ""fiction"" where King rambles about taking on the biggest work of his life and being afraid he had taken on too much. After reading this, it looks like he did indeed, take on too much."
4,another great book in an amazing series!,My book arrived with a slightly dented corner because the packaging wasnt adequate but the story itself is great.
3,Very good !,The Dark Tower series is a must read. The sixth book of the series isn`t the best one but you still have to read it to keep up with the story.
3,Set-up to finale,"Song of Susannah is the sixth book in the Dark Tower series, which is to be concluded in the final chapter-Book Seven. Unfortunately I found this `chapter' to be rather disappointing. In most of the other books the action takes place mostly in other worlds, this one takes place almost entirely in New York of 1999 and Maine of 1975 up to 1999. The plot is not moved forward any, we are mostly waiting for Susannah/Mia to have her baby, the one destined to grow up and kill Roland of Gilead, The Gunslinger. Also the inclusion of the author as a character in the story was a bit disorienting-although kind of fun. I also didn't much care for the abrupt cliffhanger ending. Hopefully all will be resolved satisfactorily in the next book, I hope so I have a lot of time invested in the story and the characters, about 20 years time."
4,Great book,I was impressed with this along with the rest of the dark tower novels. A great series if I ever read one
4,good book,It was a gift for someone but the book was in good condition and I believe he is very happy
4,The real thing,"If you are really interested in Latin music, forget about Ricky Martin, Shakira and all those so called ""latin"" idols. Miguel Bosé and Ana Torroja (from Mecano) are the real thing. They have been stars for decades in Spain and all of Latin América without having to ""shake their bonboms""(sic). Don't get me wrong, these guys are sexy, but they do not need those gimmicks to sell records.This recording is a must have for any Ana or Miguel fan, and a good place to start for people who are interested in good Spanish or Latin music. I missed hearing some great songs (""Aire"", ""Como un Lobo"", etc...), but nevertheless, I must say that all the songs that were included are great, and I especially like ""Corazones""."
4,a good duo concert,"Ana torroja and Miguel bose, a beatifull couple singing all those songs in this album, Ana has not been losing that nice voice even after so many years, and Miguel is always terrific."
2,Los grandes tambien se equivocan!!!,"Se espera y esperaba mas de estos 2 grandes cantantes ambos tienen mucha tela de donde cortar y honestamente con este material se han quedado muy pero muy cortos, debido a que la produccion tiene demasiados arreglos musicales los cuales opacan las voces de Ana Y Miguel al grado que se les escucha un tanto desafinados ya que la musica y los arreglos tienden a ser un tanto tecno y no popno lo recomiendo a nadie a menos que jamas hayan escuchado a Miguel y Ana, asi no notarian la gran diferencia y calidad de material editado por ellos antes. DECEPCIONANTE TRABAJO!."
5,Excellent diary for the time.,"This book is like a time-capsule slash diary of the revolutionary war. A wonderful true-story recollection of what it was to be a solider in the Revolutionary War. It's great to hear it right from the soldier's mouth. Rare to find, but wonderful to read, and certainly the most interesting text I've ever encountered which covers the revolutionary war. READ THIS NOW!"
1,Don't even think of wasting your time,"This video should have been titled ""Freshman Dorm : Israeli Edition"" the film maker was more interested in trying to get in one of the girl's pants than in making a compelling film. I will say that I was mightily unimpressed with how coddled these girls are and how their training seems a parody of the real thing. Do not waste a penny or a minute of your time."
1,Broke right away and HP will not stand behind,"Worked good for the first week, then the formatter went bad and we were instructed to take it to the local authorized repair shop. Three weeks later we're still waiting for the part. HP customer support is non existent. After three weeks agreed to accept a refurbished replacement but wanted a 1 year warranty, if the refurbished is just as good shouldn't they stand behind it as well? HP said no go and wanted me to pay to ship the refurbished printer. So if you want a printer that doesn't work and like to spend hours on the phone with tech and customer support, buy this printer."
4,My 1 year old loves the stable!,"My 1 year old got the stable and the little train set for Christmas. When I played the little song for him by pushing down on the horse in the package - he immediately started to sway to the music and even now a month later loves to hear that tune. He likes making the horses ""eat"" the apples and ""drink"" the water on the side of the barn. Hint to those who are constantly losing pieces - don't bother to unharness the horse 'n buggy nor the hay on the wagon. Much easier to keep together that way - I just left the original metal twist ties on (they're coated, so my son can't get hurt).Oops, dirty diaper time. Potty training is next on the list for this year - hope this review was helpful!"
3,"not great, not bad","I've had a number of scopes in the $60 - $200 range. I am comparing this scope with the Tasco World Class 3-9x40, the Mueller APV, and the Burris Fullfield II.The pros: The CenterPoint scope has a very clear and sharp image, across from edge to edge.The cons: The field of view seems smaller than for my other comparable scopes. I feel a little like I'mlooking down a tunnel. The eye relief is not very forgiving either.Also the reticle lines are kind of thick which takes some of the perceived precision out of aiming.I haven't put many rounds through the.22 rifle yet so I don't know how durable the scope is.Overally, I would recommend getting a Tasco or Mueller scope over the CenterPoint. It just does notseem to have as ""big"" an image as those scopes. I am not going to get another scope without first looking through it.."
2,Smittybilt is usually better quality,"This step does not function well. It should have had a 2X2 insert to hold and align the step. Instead. it only had a flat plate allowing the step to swing from side to side. My receiver pin hole location (ford F150)is very different than the step. I spent time filling and re-drilling the hole to keep the unit tight to the receiver. It helped a little but didn't stop the wobble. My truck has a shell with barn doors so I am always ""backing out"". Blindly planting a foot on the wobbly step is too risky so I stopped using it."
2,Mediocre at best,"Cheap construction, poor fit, and it rattles like crazy. It will serve the purpose, but it simply wasn't built for the abuse of staying on the back of a Wrangler. I'd spend a little more money for a better quality hitch step if I did it all over again."
5,The Knitting experience: Book 1: The Knit Stitch,I am an experience knitter and I love this book. The designs are not only simple but aesthetically beautiful. I am inspired to knit them all.Christine Montano.
5,Terrific for beginners and beyond terrific for everyone else,"This book takes the knitting stitch through the paces through wonderful garments that are fun and easy to knit in one piece with good techniques for finishing and developing the shape of the garment. I have made many of these sweaters in different fibers--and the sweaters look as good as can be, while they were a blast to knit.Sally's book is easy to follow and makes you just want to grab your needles and go.Sadly, the Purl book is not as great as this piece. But, then again, it is hard to top perfection."
5,Great for beginners,"I'm a beginner teaching myself to knit through books and Sally Melville's ""The Knit Stitch"" is a fabulous resource. Her explanations are clear and easy to understand. I've looked at a lot of ""how-to"" knitting books and this is the one I like the best. If you're starting from scratch without a mentor, then you can't go wrong with this book."
5,INSPIRING!!!,"I LOVE this book. I've been knitting for over 30 years, but still love the designs in here, particularly the Einstein sweater/coat which can take on so many looks, depending on the yarn. I'm looking forward to doing several of the items in here with handpainted yarns. Simple, straightforward, good pictures for new knitters, and terrific designs. I can't wait for the next one in the series."
5,Buying More yarn,Excellent addition to my knit library. I have already purchased yarn for two sweaters. This book is all about KNIT stitches and getting the essentials right. I am an intermediate knitter and found a lot to be helpful.
3,Bulky Sweaters,This has some fun patterns that are simple and quick although they tend to be a bit on the bulky side.
2,well...,Wish I hadn't spent this much on a book that I only used for one pattern. It turned out to be a waste for me.
1,"Beware, not current edition! Purchached directly from Amazon.","This appears to be a fine book; however, this isn't the current edition. It lacks revisions/correctons/accuracy! Am vThe Knitting Experience Book 1: The Knit Stitch, Inspiration & Instructionery disappointed with Amazon for not advertising it as the older edition after the newer addition was out of stock."
5,Great Reference/Pattern Book,"I have been a life-long knitter, yet still learned new techniques from this book. The patterns are done using only the knit stitch, but are interesting, nonetheless, especially the Einstein coat. I love this book!"
5,Learn to knit,I don't know why I originally chose this book but I'm sure glad I did. I had knitted as a child but didn't remember a thing. Sally's straight-forward steps and pictures along way were a blessing. I now have all three of the published books and refer to them often when I can't remember how to do a specific stitch.
5,Finally a book that really taught me to knit,"Over the last 10 years I have tried every ""learn to knit"" book out there and none have been all that helpful to me. I got this book and I finally was able to figure it out. She really has a relaxed way of teaching that makes it easy to learn. I knew I did not want to knit scarves and this book is loaded with ""beginners first projects"" that are easy to do, teach pattern reading and are not scarves. I made each of my daughters a poncho and everywhere they go they get compliments and they were my first two projects. I am now getting all of her books and will use these to teach my own daughters how to knit."
3,I wanted to love this book...,"but the projects are all so boxy and oversized. More for the Chico's crowd than, say, the Banana Republic shopper. If I had thumbed through it in a bookstore, rather than picking it off of Amazon due to the glowing reviews, I probably wouldn't have bought it.Despite that, I'll say I am knitting the poncho and I think it's going to be adorable. Also, I learned a new cast-on from the book. In general the directions are very clear and easily understandable."
3,Nice book for 80s ladies,"I can't help get excited about knitting when I read Sally's book. Her enthusiastic essays entice me to get out the needles and cast on.My biggest complaint; however is her designs. With the exception of the basic scarves and the Einstein coat, everything is so circa 1985 in style. I don't get the funky, uneven, sweaters with jumbo gold buttons. Blech! The model on the cover, with her high waist, relax fit jeans should have been a dead giveaway. Egads, mom jeans!Her instructions are excellent, so I'll keep this book on hand for skills reference. I don't think I'll be making anything though."
3,Not so great....,"I found the instructional photos in this book 'way too small to provide any good detail, and the sweater designs were too boxy to look good on anyone except the tall and skinny (i.e. models). A lot of them look like sweaters you can get at the stores, except for the yarns. A total beginner will get something out of this book, but if you already know how to knit, pass on this one.I really enjoyed her other book, Sally Melville Styles, so this book was a disappointment."
5,The Knit Stitch,"Along with Book 2, The Purl Stitch, this book is very helpful for beginning knitters. The books arrived promptly from the seller in excellent condition."
1,Cardboard characters and unengaging plotting,"I bought this book following a paper enthusing about some of its ideas in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society (JBIS Jan/Feb 2005). Unfortunately, I have to agree with earlier reviewers who have highlighted a pedestrian writing style, implausible 'characterisation' and character motivation, and the unengaging 'by numbers' plot development.I abandoned the book at page 78 as unreadable, not something I do often. My advice to the author is to read the books which you just can't put down, and really think about how their authors achieve that effect. Even in plot-driven stories, the characters have to be real and must be able to invoke empathy from the reader."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A fairly straightforward space adventure. A girl from a small backwater joint escapes from her brother who basically wants to sell her into servitude.While on the lam she stumbles across a rare alien spaceship, and meets up with a relative on another planet.A mission to get to the ship and claim it turns into struggle and conflict between different political groups.Schroeder satirises the rabid corporate copyright/drm/activation software mentality here by having one group actually live their whole lives like this, with their basic 'inscape' view of reality showing objects by their costs and rightsholding, so a rose would show it was worth 24.23 rather than look like a rose."
2,"good, bad and ugly","The author is intellectually entertaining with the cultural background of this novel, if you like that sort of thing, and I do, but that was also the novel's downfall.As others have discussed here, the two human civilizations were separate because FTL ships couldn't be launched from brown dwarf stars, where the cycler humans live. Without revealing the ending, the author built a scaffold that supported the cycler civilization as ""better"" than the FTL civilization, then ...No, I can't say anymore, except that, in the end (to solve a plot problem he had painted himself into,) he tried to have it both ways, and I can't image human beings accepting his solution when another exists.All of the criticism from others about flat characters and ""deus ex machina"" solutions to problems, I agree with. Actually, the solution to the plot problem that I can't go into without revealing the ending is classic ""deus ex machina."""
4,"Great, but . . .","I am in love with this toy. The curve is just right, and the vibration is pretty substantial for something that runs on two AA's. However, the material is a little sticky, and it disagreed greatly with my body. The abrasive problem is quickly rendered with a condom and plenty of lube, and I am happily playing again!"
1,Six Inches Back,"I LOVE Hedwig and the Angry Inch, I own the movie and soundtrack. The song Wicked Little Town makes gets me every time.This DVD is a documentary about teenagers who attend an alternative high school. Proceeds from the sale of 'Wig in a Box' a tribute album of Hedwig songs recorded by different artists will be donated to this school. It tells the story of how these kids face discrimination from their peers and family. Their stories are mixed in with artists renditions of songs from Hedwig. Some of which are not very good. Seeing the artists do take after take and mess up began to get tiresome after a while. I thought the kids liked Hedwig and were fans of it and would sing some of the songs. They didn't and don't."
3,Its not user friendly,"This product is informative, However it does not provide a quick reference to topics or commands. You have to scan this book for what you want at times which is time consuming. My only suggestion is to become more user friendly."
2,Size not correct,"Usually ""Large"" is what I buy for my husband. But this product does not use the standrad measurement and Large turned out to be too big for him. I do want to return it but this merchant does not seem to have a good return policy. And it is so much of a hassle. Hence will just live with it.Not so satisfied customer,A. Rao"
2,Yuck...,"Like all varieties in food in drink we all have different tastes. I'm sorry, wait, no I'm not!I don't like this brand and can't wait till it's all drank up...."
3,A bit stiff,"Well... I'm not thrilled, but these will workfor awhile. They don't lay down on the counterby themselves and they tend to curl up. But ifI wet a paper towel & put it under it, they laydown ok. I gave them 3 stars because they'repretty thick and the knives have not cut through."
5,Thank You J!,"Somebody help me! I can't stop playing this CD. If you love guitars and Dino jr. songs of old, you won't be disappointed. Every song ROCKS!!"
3,The first couple of chapters are all that you might need,"For me (a person who work regularly with software and computers, interested in photography), I needed the book to know about the sensors and how they work of the camera. The first few chapters give a good introduction to imaging, the jargon, and sensors (CCD and CMOS). But half-way through the book, the topics become softwares, printing formats and all such. For me, they were an utter waste. Well, I got a used copy of the book, so I won't complain about losing my money on it."
5,Excellent video to add to your collection,"This video is an excellent piece to add to your collection of The Honeymooners. It puts all Ralph's greatest schemes together. But note, too, that this title is also included with boxed set 1 of The Honeymooners Lost Episodes."
5,"""Secret"" Sierra","C. Ryan, in his review of this book, states that the ""most disappointing [aspect] is that Gilligan never suggests specific hikes during which the Sierra visitor can observe the vegetation, animals and geologic phenomenon he describes.""The book's title is The Secret Sierra, emphasis on ""secret."""
4,works for me,"I have to remove the front fender when putting the bike inside the car, and this one is fast and convenient to put on/take off. The rear fender works better with a rack than on its own. I like how light and simple these are, and am ready to put up with some flimsiness and reduced coverage compared to more heavy-duty fenders. Other reviewers were frustrated by the hardware not fitting their bikes well; it worked OK for my Bianchi Avenue, which does provide the requisite hole in the fork (1 3/4"" above the tire)."
3,mechanical ability needed,"Needed fenders for my hybrid that I take on trails. No matter how dry it has been I always seem to find a puddle and am tired of getting wet and dirty and or having a wet frozen zipper on my saddle bag. That being said I ordered these. My husband had to modify the way they attached to my hybrid frame ( I have a WSD Diamondback Clarity). He got longer screws, nylon washers and wingnuts so that no tools would be needed. Otherwise it wouldn't have worked on my bike. So now they work but in the meantime I had also purchased through Amazon the long thin Zefal fender that screws onto the saddle stem which was much more simple for me and didn't need any modification. The rear fender on this set looks like it might give you more protection than the Zefal but I have not tested them out since getting them. It is too cold out now in NJ and I am not looking to be that uncomfortable by riding through wet stuff."
3,"workes well, a little cheap","I don't use the front one, only the rear, so i can't vouch for hte front. when it arrived, though, the little clamp on the front of the rear fender (the pincher looking thing) had snapped off en route. I was bummed, and emailed the company that sent it to me. they sent me a new one, free. it works well, and keeps me clean and dry, though i wasn't able to fit it under my brake. i just ran it over the break and it works fine. i'm glad i have it, though don't know that i'd buy this particular one again."
1,Absolutely DO NOT waste your money,"I have a Trek 7.5 FX hybrid bike. I purchased these fenders to eliminate water splash during my commute. First of all, the hardware provided does not match my bike's frame. After improvising with my own nuts and bolts, I installed the fenders in about 10 minutes. They are absolutely junk. The fenders are flimsy and easily acheive an off-center position, allowing water to splash on my back. I'm not really interested in adjusting my fenders everytime I ride. If you want a good fender, purchase one that is very hard plastic or metal and attaches to the frame near the hub. Do not waste your money here."
2,"Junk, pay more for nicer fenders...........",I agree with the other poster. I have a Trek 7.5FX and these don't fit the front or the rear. I can make it fit the front by purchasing a longer bolt at the hardware store. Making the rear fit will take some work - cutting plastic and adding black zip ties.... even then I'm not so sure - they certainly won't be removable. They were only $6 so I guess I should have paid more for nicer fenders.
4,Better than taking a class,I have the VHS 1-5 when I started I had already taken 2 classes at the local sew and vac store expense and fustrating because once I was home information went into one ear and out the other. In this video she reviews working with sheers material and ruffles. I could always stop the tape and review the material at my leisure. The only thing stoping me from giving it five stars is that it is dry and dull. Very informative but dry and in need of updating if you have do videos one and two you should ease into video three. She builds on your skills and prepares you for the next step in sewing.
4,"Promising collection of songs, but recording defective.","I purchased the CD based on the song selection and a previous listen to a copy belonging to someone else. The copy I received had the recording defect several other people have mentioned--constant, loud static over all of the music. I returned it and have not tried my luck again. It's a bummer because I like the music but the defect is too distracting and not unique to the disc I received."
1,"""Used- Like New"" **** DEFINITELY NOT!!!!","It is very clear that no one actually listened to this cd before it was put on sale!!! Had they listened to it for even 1 second they would have heard the loud scratching noise that overpowered each song. I am choosing not to return this product due to the inconvenience and the low price I paid for it. The seller cannot just look at the outside packaging of a used product & deem it ""Like New""! The cd does not show scratches and the case is fine. But... I am buying it to actually listen to the music which was impossible."
1,Defective Recording,"I am a big fan of Tracy Chapman and I bought ""Collection"" in Feb 2007 with great anticipation. However, from my experience and the reported feedback of at least one earlier purchaser, I strongly recommend thinking twice before buying this CD. We have each found a major recording defect in the CD. It immediately manifests itself as a loud, rapid and persistent stacatto tick superimposed over the music. Unfortunately, the record label has not yet effectively (as of 2/12/2007) recalled the inventory so new buyers at least through that date may get a defective CD like I just did. The good news is that the seller immediately authorized return of the defective product. As a fan of Tracy Chapman, I regret this has occurred. I am also disappointed in not having the CD."
1,Static thoughout the CD,"I played the replacement CD and there it is still static throughout it. I am fustrated. I purchased it for a Christmas present. I gave it 1 star because that is the lowest star there is. If I could rate it zero stars, I would. Please,either make sure before sending the CD that it is not defective or send my money back."
1,Defective Disks,I ordered this item and received a copy which had annoying static sounds and other bad recording problems. I returned it and asked that a proper disk be sent. The replacement sent had the same problems. There may be a batch of bad disks. I gave up with the second try and asked for a refund.
5,The Absolute Perfect Collection,"I knew Fast Car from years ago, but never really heard much else from Tracy until I listened to a friends CD. I loved what I heard. Not knowing which one of her CD's to buy, I figured this Collection would be the best start. And I am not disappointed at all. This is perfection. Her words are so insightful and music so together. This is just perfect for anyone who isn't all that familiar with her work as well as those who have all her CD's."
2,Was so excited,"I ordered the Tracy Chapman Collection album. I was so excited when my order arrived. However, as soon as I played it my excitment died. The whole CD is full of static. I thought perhaps it was my CD player so I tried it on a couple different ones all with the same result. I had seen this mentioned in some other reviews and had hoped the problem would have been corrected by the time I made my purchase. Wrong. I'm sure Ms. Chapman would be upset to know that the reputation she has for the caliber of work she puts out has been sullied by this shoddy product.And Amazon: you should be ashamed."
1,Collection by Tracy Chapman,"I was excited to buy this CD with all these great hits, but much to my chagrin found an album that belonged in the trash. The static was unbearable. The producer of this CD sould be ashamed for producing such trash. They've made it hard for me to buy anything from this musician in fear of getting the same quality.They should recall the whole batch and put out a whole new CD under another title with the promise of quality. I trully love Tracy's music, but I'm stuck with not one but two CD's that I'll never be able to play! The first I bought used and decided I liked the music but not the static and thought it was because it was abused, so I went and bought a new copy to find the same satic."
1,no response,"Have not received this item after over a month, and have not received a response from seller. Still dealing w/ situation."
3,"Re-recordings, not Soundtracks","Most, if not all, selections on this album are new re-recordings of the soundtrack scores made by various orchestras, but are not original soundtrack recordings taked from the actual motion pictures described. Amazon simply is incorrect in showing this album as [SOUNDTRACK]."
4,An Enjoyable Music Experience,"John Williams is one of the greatest composers of the 20-21 centuries. His music will live on for a long-long time. This disc provides the listener with a fantastic listening experience: Star Wars, Schindler's List, Superman (The Movie - my favorite on the disc), Jurassic Park are all here. There are some other lessor known gems on the disc: Sabrina, Stanley and Iris, Presumed Innocent and others. A very nice package! All of the scores are superb and well presented here. I enjoyed this cd very much and will revisit it again and again."
3,Pretty Good but.....,"This is a very good CD however it lacks one of my favourite John Williams song, theRaiders March from the Indy movies."
1,JVC DR-MH30S DVD Recorder,"If I could give this piece of sheet a zero I would.$400 piece of sheet that's so loud its ridiculous.Piece of sheet locked up and its going against a brick wall today, piece of sheet!No wonder JVC discontinued this piece if sheet.I'll NEVER buy from JVC ever again ! piece of sheet!"
5,Weirdness IS an art form,"Mary Woronov has proven countlessly in film that she is a little off center. Her strange and intriging roles have made her a classic cult actress & even an icon. This, her 3rd novel interestingly mirrors the strangeness of her movies onto print. It's the story of a mixed up girl on a journey that's both terrifying and exciting. She tries to flirt with romance but her focus of interest could be a killer that may make her the next victim. Each chapter is titled with a snake theme as is the overall plot twists and turns much like a seemingly harmless snake would turn. Roll up under a blanket and enjoy a little piece of derainged fiction."
5,Vitale - a significant figure in landscape architecture,"Ferruccio Vitale: Landscape Architect of the Country Place Era, covers a critically important, previously unpublished period in the history of landscape architecture. It defines and illustrates, for the first time to my knowledge, the European design philosophy that formed the roots and shaped the art of contemporary landscape architectural design.The book describes through words and beautiful historic photographs, significant gardens, public parks and landscapes. It presents the professional developments of landscape architecture at the beginning of this century and the amazing accomplishments of Vitale in the advancement of landscape architecture as a profession.This book should appeal to landscape architects, architects and designers throughout the nation."
2,She's made better,"I love Tori to death, man! But I was dissapointed with this album. She had a terrific concept for an entire cover album but it completly took the edge off of her music. Peices like Eminem's '97 Bonnie and Clyde and the Clash's Strange Little girl came out great and are chilling examples of her style but the over all album is'nt as good as anything she's written herself."
4,it will do,"Neenah paper company, what makes you think your so great?These folders would never be purchased had a picture of the actual product been shown. I wonder why theres an indent in this folder for a label, or why it has a convex border around the edges and also why the corners are rounded. I would like to point out that the description never indicated which side was ""greystone""(it turned out to be the outside). The feature listed as media pocket turned out to be a slot that measures 4 1/4 inches, what media is this for?I just wanted 120 lb folder with business card tabs, nothing more.Summary:overpriced, queer, 120 lb folders."
4,Really nice introduction to digital darkroom,"Lisa Lee writes in a down-to-the-point-way. The book is en excellent INTRODUCTION to the digital darkroom. However: this is no specific introduction to using Photoshop 6, as one might believe.I've not yet had the time to dig reeeally deep into this book, but a few hours of looking through it tells me that the experienced (I'm an ACE in Photoshop) user might feel that this book doesn't contain what one might expect.Lisa Lee writes about different cameras, going deeper under the surface at one of them. I think that is a good idea, because most of the digital cameras have many options in common.She also tips the reader on HOW to take pictures, in the short-and-to-the-point-way one needs. (Time is not what we have most of, is it?) I do recommend this book - especially for beginners to intermediate users :)"
3,Good tips - Mediocre images,"I found a lot of very good information and great tips in this book but unfortunately I thought many of the example images were quite bland or mediocre. Unlike some other PS6 books with vivid images that made me want to learn a technique - many of these images left me wondering ""why would you even want to do that?"""
1,Adobe Photoshop 6 Digital Darkroom,"Not very useful. Expected a lot more specific details of how to improve images taken with a digital camera. Author's explanations are not clear. The author/publisher paid more attention to style than to content. Very, very dispointed. Felt it was a waste of money."
2,Lots of fluff,This book is full of fluff with very few details on how to do things. It is like a detailed brochure for Photoshop rather then an instructional book. It tells you what Photoshop is capable of and what menu to press but then leaves you hanging on how to use the tool. There is not a lot of detail on the tools only that they exist.
5,just enough detail,I've been using Photoshop for years and I was looking for a book to bring me up to speed on the latest 6.0 stuff for digital image editing. This book covers some of the new and some of the old... like the liquify tool and plain old masks. The photos and examples are great!
3,Nothing from 1973???,Where's the '73 season???? The 1973 National League series clinching game 5 victory over the mighty Cincinnatti Reds was played at Shea Stadium. Not to mention the Mets won 2 out of 3 at Shea in the World Series against Oakland.What gives? Maybe there will be a VOL. 2
3,"Good but, missing good stuff - see the mets fan documentary","This DVD is missing some great moment in history like 69 and 73, but I'm a Mets fan and I enjoyed what they had. Felt a little cheated that it wasn't complete. Maybe that's why they didn't list what is on the DVD. Anyway, if you're a Mets fan you should check out Mathematically Alive. Great movie about what it means to be a fan and how serious people take the sport. Very interesting and I like that it went beyond the fans and the game and explored the psychological aspects of fandom with a sport psychologist. Check it out at www.mathematicallyalive.com or Mathematically Alive: A Story of Fandom DVD"
1,Missing one of the greatest Mets games ever??????,"OK, so I wasn't around in 1969, but how can you leave out that gameAnd what the heck is that game with Mets and Yankees where Wright hit a walk off? That game is barely memorable. In fact, I had to look it up to see what game they are actually showing on this DVD.against Atlanta where the Mets scored 10 runs in the bottom of the eighth capped off by a Piazza 3-run home run? June 30, 2000. That was definitely the most memorable game for me. Shea was ROCKIN that inning. And this was in the midst of the hated rivalry between the Mets and Braves. The days of Rocker and Chipper. And this was the day after Rocker's return to Shea after making his racist comments.I was going to buy this DVD set until I found out this game was not featured. Any mets fan knows exactly what game I'm talking about. At least I still have it on VHS."
3,not so safe,"I bought this toy for my one year old and he loves it. Just one problem which in my opinion is enough to suggest you not buy it; my son doesn't use the string. He grabbed the top of the toy to push it and the square in the middle, which pops up and down when you move it, caught his finger and he screamed at the top of his lungs. His finger was stuck. I had to pull it out.Maybe it was a one in a million chance but when he plays with it now(yes I still let him play with it because he really enjoys it) I am very cautious and watch where he puts his hands."
4,Cute fun for a while,"We received this as a first birthday present, and were happy to see that it went well with our daughter's two other Peek-a-Blocks presents. She enjoyed pulling the string and leading the elephant around the kitchen. She liked the elephant noises. I sang along with the music -- it's one of those things where it can drive you nuts if you resist.The reviewers who gave it a poor setting don't understand the toy. There are two volume settings, so the music doesn't have to be loud. Blocks can pop around in the ""saddle"" -- it's meant to look like it's doing circus flips, and two of the blocks that come with the set work well with this. Other Peek-A-Blocks also can have fun flipping. The popper is NOT intended to toss it down the elephant's trunk. Toddlers can make the blocks slide down the trunk themselves.Like the Peek-A-Block wagon, it's great for a phase. After less than a year, she moved on to other toys. The Peek-a-Blocks are sitting at Grandma and Grandpa's for occasional play."
5,Better without the string.,"My son received this toy for his first birthday and fell in love with the noises immediately. Unfortunately, even though he is of average height, the string was too short for him to pull it while walking and he ended up picking it up and dumping the blocks when he tried. One quick snip later and he's in love with pushing it around.My only less than perfect rating was for Educational Value. At a year, most kids already have the two basic concepts of this toy: dropping things into a hole & move it to make noise. The Peek-a-Blocks add a lot of fun and we're glad to expand our collection."
3,loud and noisy,"i dont mind toys that make noise, but this one has a very loud popping, and when my child pulls it, it tips on its side. she does like to put the blocks in and watch them fall out."
2,"Loud, obnoxious, does not work as designed.","The toy is designed so that you put a peek-a-block on top of the elephant (in the ""saddle"" area) and when the elephant is pulled, the block is supposed to flip around and then fall into the elephant's trunk, which is a tunnel. Then it makes a bleating noise. Well, when you pull the elephant, the mechanism that pops the block around is extremely loud and obnoxious, and it does not give enough ""pop"" to the block to make it fall into the trunk.My son is 13 months old and while he has already figured out how to use most of his 18m+ toys, the elephant sits unused because it just plain does not work as designed."
1,Loud and obnoxious,"My son received this toy when he was one... he's now almost 2 and rarely ever plays with it. I regret buying it in the first place. The music and the ""popping"" sound when you pull it are both very loud and obnoxious."
2,Not worth it..,"My daughter recieved this as a gift for her first birthday. The look and concept of it is cute, but, I really don't see the point of it.She also got Peek-a-Boo blocks, so, she took the blocks from this toy, and uses it for her peek-a-boo set.There's just nothing special about this toy."
5,My Son Loves It,"My son really loves this toy! He loves to pull it around behind him and hear the thing pop! The only thing is that the popping is so LOUD! It really tends to drive me crazy but if you are one of those parents who doesn't mind the noise I say buy it!! The kids just love it, my daughter loves it too and she is four years old."
5,Very Good,"I thought the CD was well done, especially for a live CD. Charlie Hall and Louie Giglio certainly have a heart for the Lord and it shows in their work.The CD itself was recorded live at the Passion conference from 1/1/1999-1/4/1999. The worship leaders are Charlie Hall (tracks 1,2,3,8,9,10,11,12), Shelley Nirider (4,6,12), Jami Smith (5), and Chris Tomlin (7), so anyone interested in the music from those people will want to give this CD a spin. Although the songs are now sung frequently in churches, many were new at the time the CD was released.Excellent CD all around."
5,I love this CD,Out church loves this CD we are a non-Denominational church. We are more modern the most churchs we sing worship music like this. Our praise band sings 8 out of 10 of the songs on this CD it is Great!!!!
1,didn't work the first time but did the second,"Had to try and download the song twice, it finally worked and only charged me once. Can't edit star quality, should be 4 stars."
2,Disappointed,"These are somewhat small. That is my fault for ordering the size. However, unrolling as I use them, I found that I had to throw out three of the bags because they were sliced."
3,strong small pastry bags,"nice, strong, thick plastic used to make this pastry bag. they are small though. 12"" is not that big but good for piping detail work. there is some stretch so i have to use a coupler if working with a stiffer icing or buttercream or else the tip can pop right out."
5,Very Pleased,I was a little nervous to try these disposable bags because I have had trouble with other brands splitting down the side at the seams when I was in the middle of a decorating project. These have not given me any trouble. They are sturdy and strong! I like that they are in a roll and can neatly be kept away when not in use.
2,Disposable pastry bags,A lot of times when Im in the middle of doing something the bags will explode all over me and ruin what I'm doing
4,great guitar stylist,"It is good for old Eric Gale fans to be able to purchase thiscd. It will bring back many memories. It will also remind youof how great a guitar player he was. I am grateful that I'vehad a chance to own many recordings that he has played on. Payclose attention to She is my lady and morning glory. This is amust have cd. jaye priceBeltsville, md."
4,beautiful,"although there are times when it sounds a bit treble-y; the piano at least. The vocals are amazing. I also love that I have no idea what she's saying; if it were something silly it would ruin the effect. Discovered this band through the venerable Aquarius records and got a cheap copy here (I know, I should be supporting independent record stores...but I work at a non-profit). This will not be a regretted purchase."
4,Family,"I haven't read the book yet cause I can't find it.But I can tell you the family is fine, I am friends with his granddaughter shes a little crazy but an awesome person.We are currently trying to find out the most information we can so we can get to the truth."
1,False --yellow journalism--authors fabricated most of story,"It's unfortunate, that the authors need to make their living by fabricating information in this book. I know first hand that the authors created their own fantasy and did not report on the facts. They didn't even interview some of the professional people mentioned in the story. Instead, they used their distorted imaginations to make up a story that just might be ""believable."" Please remember to maintain a critical mindset when reading books from authors as such."
1,I read this... I lived near this... Unreal.,"Okay, I grew up right down the road from Frenchy and I worked for him during the summer picking tomatoes. This guy was not possessed. He was very disturbed and clearly had some issues not to mention that he was a sex offender.I rode the bus with his daughter and it was clear that, even in a town like Warren, she was being neglected.This book is complete rubbish. As a matter of fact, I would be willing to bet that when the book mentions that Frenchy heard voices outside of his house, it was my friends and I yelling into the house that we were satan coming for him. I'm not proud of that.. believe me.. but it's true. This book is making excuses for a sick man.Now, I enjoyed working for him and he was always fair... but... he was a sex offender. The world and his family is better off without him."
5,flag,I got the item faster than i thought. What you see is what you get. Hangs perfectly on my car and makes me proud from where I came from. Thanks!
5,Flag position was correct,"Remember, you the installer of the flag was not the observer. The observer was on the other side across you looking at the flag. Therefore, the displayed flag's position was correct."
2,Wrong Flag Position/Orientation,"Republic Act No. 8491 of the Philippines states the following:""SECTION 10. The flag, if flown from a flagpole, shall have its blue field on top in time of peace and the red field on top in time of war; if in a hanging position, the blue field shall be to the right (left of the observer) in time of peace, and the red field to the right (left of the observer) in time of war.""Not many people know this when the flag is in a hanging position, which side should be where. But keep in mind, that this flag is inverted. This would be correct if the country is at war, but it is not."
3,Good for costume,This badge is nice looking but the clasp is cheap and pops out easily but pops back in almost as easy. Nice for a visual effect but not much else.
5,Great Policeman's Badge,"Grandson loves playing policeman, arresting people giving out tickets, stopping speeders, etc...and likes to have a badge. Unfortunately, most are cheap plastic that either cannot be affixed to his clothing or belt, or break easily. This one is perfect. It's metal, is not flimsy, has a very good clip on the back, and is now a treasured toy. Exceeded my expectations both in terms of quality and my grandson's happiness to have as close to a real policeman's badge as he can without going off to the academy."
3,It worked,Our goal was to have a badge foe a scene we were shooting. So that happened. The pin initially came apart when we let the guy put it on himself. We had to fix it and put it on for him.
2,Broke...,We bought this for my daughters birthday and in less than 4 months the pin broke off the back. I am bummed as I bought the metal one thinking it would last longer.
3,Pretty Good,"This was not exactly what I was expecting, but it was good enough for the badge holder and to last for halloween"
4,??????? Why is the pin different?,"I have 2 of the same type badge, and just bought another one from this seller. The other 2 I had brought in a store in Puerto Rico. When I received this badge I noticed that it was different then the other two. Sure they look very similar, but this one is made different. The back has a different pin. Its not like a real badge pin like the other two I have. It also weighs less, and the reason is because the back is carved in instead of a smooth surface like my other 2. If you are okay with the stupid pin in the back that wont allow you to put it on any holster besides attaching it to a uniform shirt. I hate the back."
5,Very Impressive,"This was really not what I expected. This ""toy"" seemed to be the best badge I have seen trying to search for them in a lot of different places here in houston. I was also very pleased on how fast I got this, it was only like 3 days before i got it. five stars!!"
1,Don't Recommend.,"It's decent metal but thought it had a sturdier clip on the back. It was just a little pin glued on, it broke off w/in a day my son was so upset. I wouldn't recommend purchasing it."
3,Police Badge,"It's a nice weight for a costume police badge. However, it doesn't attach to the holder well. It's like they weren't made for each other."
4,like it,"This badge is made of metal and is of decent quality for the price. The ""pin"" of the badge can damage your clothes when put on."
3,Cranker,I orderd this video not knowing what to expect. I had heard different things about it and they were all pretty dead on. The footage is pretty good but they always cut the climbs. I think that there is about 5 climbs that they show you if the climber tops out or clip the ancors. It is a good video but nothing amazing.
2,"Nice Climbing, Not so Great Production","I am a new climber. And I'm not an 18 year old boy. After watching this, I want to produce my own video on climbing! It was interesting to watch these excellent climbers but I'm not sure I am pumped to go out and climb. (Or drink a gallon of milk and puke.) My problem is that I can not find any instructional type videos on climbing. This was the first one I watched. So, overall I was a little disappointed. It looks like some young inexperienced group of boys shot this with a camcorder. So if you are a young male climber, you will probably like this. If you are a 42 year old female videographer, you will be less likely to be impressed!"
1,Inertia couldn't be much worse,"Wow. I can't believe that anybody could find something positive to say about this video. Out of the dozens of climbing videos I've seen, this is close to the worst. The footage is terrible, and clips are often repeated three or four times during the video to make it seem longer. I know retail stores that struggle with this video since multiple customers try to return it, aghast at the absurdity of charging money for such boyish dabbling in video. You want a good video? Buy ""The Real Thing,"" ""Free Hueco,"" or ANYTHING but this!"
2,RAMPAGE is better,"Poor video, poor.... very bad filming, very boring boulders problem....is short video...don't buy it ther are other videos better than this one...trust me! :-)"
1,Not good,"Poor video the price is high for a bad filming ... incomplete parts ...some good climbx but the filming is horrible...there are better videos than this one like rampage, masters of the stone, the dose, etc... don't buy it...the filming is poor he us bad camera for this and bad angles, you would not like seing somebody doing a 5.14 and the he cut it and you don't see the climber finishing the route... if you buy it an see it you will feel that Paul Dusako have steal money doing this horrible work."
1,Fake rap,Man if you like this stuff u tripping. The hot boys is wack. (...) This music is so bad I don't know where to start. All that bling bling crap.They beats sound like they were made on a cascio.(...)
4,That HotBoy click on fire.....,"This is one god Ca$h Money album. This was bakc in the day when Manny Fresh just cared about making music and wasn't thinking about all of his rolexes and how much his cars cost. Ca$h Money was tight back in the day but now they are just worried about making money. They don't care about the hood anymore. Tha G-Code and The Block Is Hot are the worst albums out by Ca$h Money. This album Get It How U Live was a great album and it as hits like We On Fire,50 Shots Set It Off,Hot Boy and more. If you want a good Cash Money album get this one."
5,THE HOT BOYS ARE SOOOOOOOOO FINE,"WHEN ARE YOU COMING TO HOUSTON, TEXAS, BECAUSE I WOULD REALLY LOVE TO SEE YOU ON FIRE."
5,Thank god they got out of the ghetto,"I'm very excited that these guys finally made it out of the ghetto, because growing up they were always stealing our bikes and mugging us cause we were rich and they were poor, but now thanks to Cash Money, they no longer have to. So I gave it five stars even though I don't understand a word they say cause I don't speak the language. Yeay hot boys! They sure are swell. One word: NIFTY!"
5,The BEST rap cd I've ever heard!!!,"It's only a matter or time before Cash Money Records becomes the next heat wave from the south. They've been in the rap game for about seven years, and all the hard work Mannie Fresh and Slim Williams,(co-owners of Cash Money), have put into the company is finally starting to pay off."
3,Wrapping needs work,Item arrived new but the case was cracked. Looks like it was due to the cheap wrapping
3,Underground,"This is one of the HOT BOYS first CD, it is underground and not sold in many large retailing stores, it has all 4 HOT BOYS rapping off of each other, they make the beat sound better, the only reason I gave it a 3 is because that the production is underground which causes the sound quality 2 be bad in certain songs, and some times the records skips. Otherwise, it has the best overall."
4,good stuff,"Finally, a moisturizer that's rich enough for my dry skin. The fact that it's was so heavily discounted though tells me that it might be discontinued."
1,Skip It - Better Books Are Available,"A previous reviewer mentioned giving away 500 copies of this book. If that is accurate then it begs the question ""Why this book?"" Because it fills a void? This book IS a void! The author obviously hasn't bothered to keep the book updated since its original publishing date of 1996 and it shows. There is a substantial gap of knowledge present in this book and the reader is advised to seek a more modern discussion of the topics. An excellent alternative is 'The Prostatitis Manual: A Practical Guide to Management of Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome'. A bit more expensive, but it leaves 'The Prostatitis Syndromes' in the mists of time where it belongs. You get what you pay for."
1,Total and Complete,"This is a ""vanity press"", self-published pile of junk! Go to Google and enter ""prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain"" and look at the sites you get. They completely discount the theories the author Hennenfent (who no longer practises as a doctor - check the AMA listings) is pushing. What makes this so much worse is that the author seems to have some sort of relationship with the two or three clinics in the world which profit from applying the unusual treatments he recommends. Buyer beware!!"
1,"Very Poor Book, not worth the price","The author is sadly mired in the past. The other reviews here praising the book are completely unbelievable. I found the book's emphasis on microbial pathogenesis to be a rehash of old theories and treatments that are dubious at best, harmful at worst. The latest research all points in other directions for prostatitis, male chronic pelvic pain syndrome and male interstitial cystitis. Big thumbs down. I suggest a Google search for the exact phrase ""chronicprostatitis forum"", which will take you to a place where the very latest concepts and breakthroughs are being discussed, and where you can find more interesting data about this author Bradley Hennenfent as well. They also have excellent book recommendations there!"
1,Nothing new here,"A rehash of old discredited theories. Modern research is going completely into other directions. Read for information, but don't expect to cure your BPH or prostatitis with it."
5,Alfeds Basic Guitar Method Complete,"I am about halfway through the book and it is pretty good, It seems to have a logical progressionand it explains things very well. I wish there were more songs or an song book that goes with it.I have learned more about guitar in the last 4 months teaching myself than I learned from 3 years of guitarlessons when I was young."
1,Does NOT come with all three CDs as indicated and shown.,This item only comes with CD #3. So only tracks for the third section of the book are available. Amazon is supposedly shipping the book that is pictured. BUT the book is as described. Nicely organized with large print.
4,One is almost as good without the other,"I've been a fan of Tangerine Dream since the 70's and wish they'd (Franke and Edger Froese, anyway) collaborate again. I find myself wishing for that TD guitar work in this. And when I'm listening to the Froese only TD, I find myself wishing for the lush keyboard and synthesiser work that Franke brings to the team. Butohwell, this is good stuff anyway. Guess I'll just play along on my strat."
3,A pleasing compilation,"I was not aware of this compilation until I came across it in a store. I procured it because I knew that Christopher Franke had been a previous member of Tangerine Dream. I did not expect to be disappointed and was not. Epic is an impressive collection of 18 New Age instrumentals by Franke. Two of these--""Flower Hill Trail"" and ""Sensual Persuasion""--are previously unreleased. This compilation is just over 64 minutes. It was released in 1999. The album's musicianship and sound quality are gratifying. Throughout, I find every one of the tracks to be relaxing, serene, and ambient. My favorite ones are ""Mental Images,"" ""Woodland Watercolors,"" ""Viciente,"" ""Mind Space,"" and ""Stream Garden."" The CD booklet includes an essay of Franke. The album cover artwork is also nice. Actually, I rate this disc 3.5 stars. Epic is a captivating compilation."
4,Metal Eraser Polisher,The metal eraser polisher were an outstanding product for our swords. We are surely going to order more.Wali Islam
3,MegaSonud???,"This live album is short but have a good sound, really good riffs, and this music is explicit and direct, like the band. I have it since 1994, and still into my favorites albums. My two favorites songs: Laughter, and Road Machine. They sounds like Megadeth between Peace Sells... and So Far so Good, So What!!....And Md.45 also, a Dave Mustaine solo proyect."
3,Photograph looks nothing like the product,This product is listed correctly. It is for the rear disc brakes for the Honda Accord 6th Generation 2.3L 4cyl. It fits the rear disc brakes of my 98 Accord EX. However the photograph is for the set of Front Disc Brake Hardware. The Front Brake Hardware set only includes the metal clips for the pads and doesn't include the rubber boots and slider shims. You will need to purchase them separately.FYI the Centric hardware kits for 6th Generation Accord EX sedan are:Front disc brake hardware #117.40029Rear disc brake hardware #117.40028[...]
3,Typical PBS stuff but soft intro to racism,"If I wanted to introduce a young child to racism, I wouldn't start off with ""Rosewood"" ""Amistad"" or ""Beloved"" (although my toddler has been with me to two of them). This is a tame afterschool-special-like treatment of racism in the South. Good for showing at school or to young children."
4,Collector's item,"Profyle has gotten off to a great start with their first album. They can really hold a note and it's worth the price just for the jam ""Just can't get you off my mind"", pick it up!"
5,Dam This Is Good!!!!!!!!!,"After hearing the song 'make sure your home' on the radio I decided to check out some of their other songs from the album 'WHISPERS IN THE DARK' ... and after hearing songs like 'Whispers In The Dark', 'Make Sure Your Home' and 'Too Shady' I knew I had to go and get this album. Now Profyle is on top of my favourite RnB groups in front of such groups as Jagged Edge and 112. With their smoove silky vocals and some of the best slow jam songs and RnB grooves I ever heard, I put it on while making love with my girl and now she loves them too. Good news for all the Aussie RnB lovers in Sydney I heard on GrooveFM( Syd ) that Profyle will be coming to OZ in 2001, so get out there and check these guys out and now I can't wait to check out their other album 'NOTHIN' BUT DRAMA'."
5,Just a common couple,"We are not lovers of lobsters to eat or science wise, they are ok but not an absolute favorite to eat. However, in July we met the authors Mom at Seawall on Acadia National Park in Maine. She told us about her sons book, she was a good salesperson. We are reading it together for a hubby/wife time together - and we are surprised how it is so well written, very interesting for a subject that I wondered if I would even finish two chapters of, but it is engrossing even for those with a medium interest in learning more about Lobsters, Lobstermen, etc. Insightful too."
3,Pretty interesting I learned a lot...,After I read F/V Black Sheep I got interested in the lives of lobstermen and how they fish. This is a good book and you sure learn a lot about lobsters. I didn't know most of the stuff in this book. I liked F/V Black Sheep better because it was exciting and had more of a story to it but this tells you a lot about the lobsters and how they live.
4,Lobsters are as interesting as they are good-tasting,"I love to eat lobster, but I never gave much thought to the details of their habits and survival. I had always envisioned them crawling around on the bottom of the sea waiting to be consumed. However, this book opened my eyes to the complexity of lobsters.This book tells of lobsters' habits such as reproduction, growth stages, molting, migrating, feeding, fighting, and so much more. But, the book is not just about the lobsters themselves. Like the other reviewer said, it's about lobstermen and their families and their lives on Little Cranberry Island. It also goes into lobster research and conservation efforts.This book is informative, interesting and amusing."
5,Melt the butter!,"A good book for breezy summer reading. Just a work detailing the scientific study of lobsters and how that science has affected the fishery in Maine. Well written, well researched and fun to read.Highly recommended."
2,Wasted Potential,This book seems to have a split personality. It seems to want to tell us about loberstermen or how lobsters live in the wild and efforts to preserve them. If it had stuck to one or the other it may have been a great book but what we get is disjointed and unfocused. There were many times when I would like to have learned more about a particular topic but it was left undone. The Discover channel did a special on lobsters in 2002 that was far more interesting and engaging.
5,not just lobsters!!,"Saw this book in a bookstore along the Maine coast while on vacation. I decided it would go along with my vacation to read a bit about lobsters--what I did not know was that I would now be hooked on the idea of these ""single subject"" books--ie-Salt,Cod (Kurlansky). This author has an amazing ability to make what seems like the silliest subject for a book become a complete story--It was one of those books that I was sad to finish, and am now on the search for more like it--I learned of the ocean, history of fishing, culture of Mainelanders, love and life of crustaceans and about marine scientists and their work- great book--a keeper!"
5,How many penises does a male lobster have?,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. Besides being about the sex-life of my favorite food (the answer is two), it is a masterpiece of craftsmenship by one of America's best writers. Corson's perspective comes from two years on a lobster boat on the Maine coast. It is a perfectly interwoven story about fishermen, real scientists (not Disneyfied), politics and a successful species survival plan that other fisheries could learn from. So far, I have purchased three copies of this delightful book and will probably keep giving it to lobster-lovers as long as it is in print."
4,A beautiful mix of comics,"This is really a nice mix of short comics from several artists, some at this time already highly accomplished. I particularly enjoyed Kazu Kibuishi's comics and Vera Brosgol is excellent as always (do buy her Anya book!). A beautiful new discovery for me is ""Outside My Window"" by Khang Le. Way to go! A few of the comics are on the weaker side (but who am I to complain, I can't draw most anything), but overall an enjoyable and varied collection."
4,Good Mix,As a whole I liked this publication and I thought most of the stories were enjoyable. There seems to be something for just about everyone. Although there were a few that left me scratching my head....and wondering what the heck was going on. But I'm glad I decided to give this hodge podge of stories a chance and I am very much looking forward to the other volumes in the series.
2,"Good art, weak writing","I bought this book because it was listed as a must-buy by the Library Journal and by a number of graphic novel bloggers.I have no idea why.The art is gorgeous, but the stories are generally very weak. It always takes at least two reads to understand what the point of the stories are and many of them are still lost on me. Many of them read like scenes from the middle of a story, and lacking the setup, or the general direction of the overall narrative, they make for strange reading. It's much like tuning into a movie an hour in and watching five minutes of the film. Or, like picking up a comic for one issue in the middle of a storyline.In general the creators of the vignettes are far more talented as artists than they are as storytellers. It seems that, by design, the art is far more important than the story here, so if that's what you are looking for, you will not be disappointed. If you want good stories, don't buy this book."
3,Curious,"I bought the first volume because Amazon recommended the eighth volume because of an artist whose books I've gotten is in it. So I checked it out and it sounded interesting since I'm facinated by flight. I was a little disappointed, expecting more narratives and stories dealing directly with flight. However since it's a collection of artists with their own interpretations I should've expected a wide and loose interpretation of flight. I still enjoyed it and will probably pick up more issues to see what other stories/art show up."
3,Don't judge a book by its cover...,"If you've ever looked at the volumes of Flight the front covers are beautifully drawn by Kazu Kibuishi. Just the Covers alone take you into this artist imagination, a world filled with different outlooks and point of views of different dimensions that make you think if you were really there everything would seem logical. I happen to love his artwork and his other work, Amulet. BUT,,,,, Sadly I was disappointed when I got volume one only to find that the front cover had nothing to do with the whole book. Its just a compilation of lots of small short comics from different writers. Nothing to do at all with the front cover that drew me in so deeply into these books. Sadly I skimmed through it and sold it to Hastings. I judged this book by its cover.Look into it before you get it. Don't make the same mistake I did.Great though if your into small works and compilations."
4,"We all have wings, but some of us don't know why.","Kazu Kibuishi (ed.), Flight, vol. 1 (Image, 2004)Interesting collection of graphic shorts, varying in quality (of course) but most relatively strong. Interestingly, I liked Kibuishi's the best (usually I find editors who include their own work in anthologies use second-rate stuff they couldn't get published elsewhere); appealing characters, strong storyline, manga-style artwork without being overly cute or cloying. But Kibuishi's two stories are by no means the only reason to pick this up; there are a number of solid artists represented here. Open to a random page and you're likely to like what you see. ***"
3,COLOR WARNING: This is very much a brighter red than depicted,"The picture on this item is not dark brown as it looks.It is a very warm cherry red (yes it says cherry but I'd thought it would be very dark according to the picture)This therefore doesn't match anything I have in my place so I'm attempting to return it. Wish the picture was more color accurate.Other than that the quality is okay, a little messy in one place on the varnish/paint but overall looks decent, I would not describe it as super high quality, however."
5,Great rack: beautiful and practical,"This rack was very easy to install. It has a beautiful wood finish that adds an air of elegance to my entry way (and matches the decor in my condo!). I've been amazed at its ability to support the weight of all my winter coats, scarves, hats, etc. Great rack - I highly recommend it."
1,This book is not about science,"Any approach to dreaming that is based on the idea that REM sleep is dreaming is just wrong. There is a very interesting state of REM sleep - a state for which we have lots of data from both scanning and animal studies. But there is little or no scientific evidence that dreaming is in any way specially associated with REM sleep. Sleep onset dreams are remembered just as frequently and are just as bizarre - if you don't believe this is so, visit a Salvador Dali painting at your local museum. Deep sleep dreams are more rarely remembered but even more bizarre - have you ever had a night terror? There is no logical basis for neuroanatomical research into REM sleep to be applied to dreaming. A presentation such as this is not based on science, it's based on Hobsons' theory that he calls AIM - a theory without supporting scientific evidence, and a theory that this book perpetuates as ""science"" when it is in reality scientific myth."
1,Just a Textbook,"I 100% disagree with the reviews others have given this book. Actually, I could barely trudge through this book, it was THAT boring. The author has no distinct voice. In fact, it's as if she just looked around the Internet and library and put together a bunch of facts about dreaming. It read like a college student's report... with much too many references to other research. If you're interested in the regurgitated history of dreams, then you might like this book, but I honestly was hoping for something more, not just a textbook."
4,"Entertaining, an easy read for the layperson.","Overall, a very good intro to sleep science. The author covers a variety of different theories on dreaming and related processes in the brain. Very interesting, with an excellent Notes section as well as an excellent Bibliography."
2,Average at Best,Decent programming in the front half of the CD is overshadowed by some of the worst mixing I've ever heard come out of a production studio. I'm shocked Dmitri allowed this CD to be burned in the state it's in. There are other disks that contain many of the tracks Dmitri uses without the trainwrecks.
3,Pretty Good,"The track selection is great but the mixing is lacking. His transitions bettween songs are very amaturistic. I so him live a couple of months ago, and I might say it was pretty disapointing."
4,Not As Good As Seeing Him Live,"Dimiri was my introduction to the wonderful world of Trance music. I saw him live in Amsterdam at Roxy (the greatest club in the world I might add) and he was amazing, I have never seen anyone move the crowd like him. So, when I got back to the states a looked to see if he had any mix CDs out, and the only one is this one. I love it, his track selection is the bomb his mixing kicks major as*. The best way to listen to this is LOUD with a good set of speakers and a nice sub woofer. Like I said Dimitri is the artist who got me turned onto Trance, and this was that CD."
2,ICU? Well not after this ...,"The Dutch Maestro gives us probably one of his worst submissions ever...From some of the worst recorded, and commercially available mixing I have ever heard to some of the worst track selections...Dimitri has made so many excellent contributions to Music that this Album should have been withdrawn from sale to prevent colouring your judgement.Please don't buy it.Wildex"
5,N'sync and Gloria Estefan,"N'sync and Gloria Estefan did a wonderful job together producing that CD. The song brings joy and love to your heart.It also brings loved ones closer to one another. I like the CD because the song has happiness and joy in it. N'sync as an excellent boy band has great vocals, they blend in together and they always put in all their feelings into their songs to make it feel alive. Gloria just adds more harmony and feelings in which makes them sound even better. Their CDs are always available to the public and are selling at a very good price range. I am always glad to send my review for all the N'sync and Gloria Estefan lovers out there."
5,Music of my heart no. 2,N sync and Gloria Estefan sound wounderful together. The song is written great and it has really good feelings put into it. This song will always be cherished in my heart.
2,"beautiful, but broken","This bracelet is actually really nice, but too bad it is so cheaply made that mine broke in about 2 weeks. It's easily fixed all I need is to get new end-clasps and attach them to the leather braid, but I was hoping for a better made product."
1,this item is crap,"I purchased the Sterling Silver and Braided Black Faux Leather Bracelet - 8"" It came undone constantly with normal wear, and in less than a month the cheap fastener broke and I could not wear it anymore. End of story. Don't waste your money."
2,not so good,"I bought this toy for my twin girls because it was the only toy with wheels in the store that was approved for 6 months old...it doesn't roll very well, even on very short pile carpet. The blocks seem to have worn out, only one out of the three still turns easily on the toy. And the only thing my girls seem to like it for is to push the button without the block on it so it vibrates their fingers! I thought it would be a good toy, but it mostly just sits on the shelf."
5,Great toy!,"I got this for my son over the summer when he was 18mos old. It is by far his favorite toy! The push & go action is great as is the realistic train sounds. He does not play with the blocks at all, but the train is a hit!"
5,Fun is still going!,"My son got this as a christmas present in 2004 and he still loves playing with it. It doesn't much on carpet but he enjoys pushing it. He also enjoys switching the blocks around. He loves the music. He has figured out how to turn it on after I turn it off for the night, and he puts it on the loudest setting. Which is fine, it is not annoying sound at all. This is one of his favorite toys! I want to get him another just in case this one ever falls apart and it as a backup."
5,A Big Hit,"I bought this last Christmas for my daughter who was 14 months at the time and she and my 2 1/2 year old loved it. Now my 10 month old son loves it. He plays with it all of the time. He doesn't really use it with the blocks, but he likes to push the whistle and watch is move. Usually he'll hold it in place, but he loves it. It was a hit with everyone."
5,Great train!,This toy is wonderful! Inside the blocks are circus animals that move when the train is going. By far this is my sons favorite toy. It is very easy for a baby to activate and has lights that blink. Very cute music as well. It even goes on carpet.
4,Enjoyable,"My little 10 month old was playing with this when she was over at a friend's house, so I decided to get it. She quickly learned how to turn the music on, and she loves to push on the little turntable to make the music go. When it starts to move, she of course crawls after it. It is cute, encourages movement, and isn't too annoying. It is a good distractor for a good 15 minutes."
3,Forget it if your house is carpeted,This is a fun little toy IF your house isn't carpeted. It just couldn't move on our carpet...very disappointing as it looked like a fun toy. It was just going to burn out and eat batteries trying to chug along on our carpet so we returned it :( It definitely could have been better made! Only the rear wheels on the engine do any of the work to get the toy in forward motion..that's a lot of work for 2 wheels!
5,Great Fun,"My daughter received this toy from her grandmother for Christmas - she loves it...and so do we! The train move along, playing music and certain blocks spin or slide around while the train is in motion. It's educational too. My daughter sees the lion, she roars, she sees the elephant, she tries to make an elephant sound and so on. It's a great toy and she will be getting more peek a boo blocks for her birthday."
3,regrettable purchase,"The toy itself is a toddler fave. However, the seller of the one I purchased neglected to mention that it was not in working condition."
3,broke really fast,my son love it so much he broke it with in a few days of buyingi was hoping it would have stood up to him playing with it
3,"Mommy loves it, baby hates it","I give this toy 5 full stars. My 10 month old son gives it 1. He is terrified of this train and we don't understand why. He likes the blocks and the blue car that detaches from the engine and second car but will have nothing to do with the rest of it. When I push the button to make the lights flash and the block spin, he's just okay with that, but if I push the smokestack to make the train roll across the floor he goes ballistic. It's gotten so bad that I can't even let him see the train. I'm very sad that my son dislikes this train so much. I think it's a wonderful toy: very colorful and fun. I like the little blue car that rocks two blocks back and forth while carrying a third, as well as the fairly realistic steam engine sound and train whistle. We keep hoping that eventually our son will grow out of his fear of this toy and will come to love playing with it."
5,Es una seleción excelente,"La versión de las cuatro estaciones porteñas de este disco guardan una fidelidad impresionante con las versiones originales de las cuatro estaciones porteñas de buenos aires. A pesar de que son una adaptación para una orquesta de camara, es bastante agradable escucharlas. LE Grand Tango, es bastante buena, incluso mucho mejor (DEFINITIVAMENTE) que la que aparece en el disco de yo-yo MA ""soul of the tango"". A cada persona que le he mostrado este disco (personas que ya conocen la obra de Astor Piazzolla), ha querido comprarlo, pero es una lástima que esté ""fuera de stock"" muy a menudo. Este disco se hizo con motivo del 25 aniversario de la musica camerata de montreal."
4,Hair removal,"Quite like it, very easy to use, cools and comes off easily if you don't get it off the first time."
2,Not as good as original!,"I loved the original wax by bliss. This new microwaveable version just doesn't work as well. It takes so long to heat up. It really was easier to heat it up on the stove. It's like New Coke, why mess with the original?"
3,Mostly pleased with product,"The product works good. The things that are not that great about the product is that it does not come with enough sticks to spread the wax and I already ran out, but have lots of wax left. The wax is only melting in the middle and the sides are not melting which is a lot of unused wax. Otherwise the kit works out fine."
2,It does the job but...,"I was looking for a wax to do in between my regular professional wax at the spa. I'm a regular but sometimes I can't get an appointment when I need it so I tried Bliss. I read all the reviews and everyone was spot on. My only issue was the fact that all the wax is not usable. All the product left on the sides of the cup never melts. I think that's a waste of money. The other thing is that it works better with small amounts of hair. I learned that the hard way.:(So all in all, I use it when I need a quick in between job but it certainly won't replace my trip to the spa!"
5,quality product,This waxing kit is just what I was looking for. I use it for my eyebrows every two weeks. It is convenient and easy to use. You just heat up the wax in the microwave and wah lah. Now I dont have to spend 15 dollars to get them done professionally and can do it at my convenience. The only drawback is that it is not ideal for larger areas like underarms.
