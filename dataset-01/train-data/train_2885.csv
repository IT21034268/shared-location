1,Not correct,When I ordered this product I thought I was getting what I saw in the picture. But when I received my item. It wasn't even close to the picture. Although i received the item on time. Football season is already here and I wanted a flag to put up. I didn't have the time to return this item and wait to receive the correct one. I'm not happy with it although my boyfriend is.
3,Passable hay,"This hay is passable at best. It does not compare to OXBOW hay, however. But I had to buy this as an emergency and I have Prime.The price is about the same as Oxbow as well, but the quality is subpar. The hay is nice and green but it's cut really short so it just falls onto the litter like a pile of litter itself. It does come in a nice resealable package though. Oxbow hay is far superior in that it smells so fresh and the hay is fluffy and LONG.If you can get oxbow hay then do so! Although shipping usually makes it more expensive. But if not, I guess this will do.Think of hte guinea pigs!"
5,guinea pig hay,package came in sooner than estimated arrival date. its good product for the price. highly recommend and will order again from this seller. :)
1,Horrible,I bought this for my 8 week mini rex. He hates them. Its like puke to him. he won't budge..Though the other products he loves. he'll eat all I give him. But when I gave him this...Nope. He only uses it as a bedding.I will never buy this again.Don't buy this for your mini rex
3,product is as described but not spill proof if your pup plays with his water.,"Hi this product is as described but I had high hopes for it and I believe the design fell short. I hoped that ataching his water dish to the side of the crate would prevent my 9 week old golden retriever puppy from being able to tip it over because he loves ""taking a bath"" in his water dish during meal time. the first time in the crate he figured out how to tip it over. I tried using it lower but then it became a headrest and he napped instead of eating. :) I am hoping I can at one point reintroduce once my dog is older and grows out of this behavior..:)"
3,hmmmm,i got two of these for my lab/collie mix and they seem pretty decent. one of them didnt really fit in the black ring it sits in so i switched it with the other one and that seemed better. they seem to be pretty decent so far and she hasnt knocked them out of the holder or anything. for the price i got them i really like them but if i got them at full price id be a lil disappointed. but they are pretty good.
3,Exactly what I expected,"I use these as rabbit food dishes - they work well and the stainless is easy to keep clean. I have very large rabbits, and they are able to pull the dishes out of the holder ring, which causes some waste of food. In general though, I would order them again."
3,"For my purposes, three stars","It's a great item. Very secure, good size bowl. Unfortunately, I bought this as a food dish for my kittens and it's too deep for them. It makes for a good water bowl, although that was not my initial intent. Also, considering how much shipping cost, I could have gone to my local petstore and paid 1/2 the price."
3,tiny and not sturdy,"I thought that this would be great for the crate since the water bottle I had attached was constantly leaking; the problem is my puppy 20 pounds can knock this off easily and then more water in the crate; it attaches by a bracket on the outside and bar on the inside; wing nut goes on the outside to tighten it; my puppy can knock it off and it concerns me because the wing nut and brackets may make it inside the crate with the dog so back to the leaking water bottle, safer."
4,Good for an older dog.,"It's a good product and does what it says. However, it has 1 wing nut so if the dog is play-full in their crate they can easily knock it over and bring it in with them. It should span two openings in the crate and secure with 2 wing nuts."
2,Read description carefully!,"This is ONLY the tiny 8 oz bowl. The picture shows both bowls, and this is misleading. You can buy the larger 16 oz bowl separately, and it is actually a little less expensive than the 8 oz bowl for some reason, but this item does NOT include both of the bowls depicted in the picture."
4,"Solid Product, Attaches Securely","Good secure attachment to crate.It sits at a slight slant in the frame, so you can't go 100% full.Pay attention better than I did to the 8oz size. It's more like a rabbit or tiny dog size. Too small for my 40 pound dog, yet their description is accurate if you actually read it."
5,Min Pin Loves them,My little min pin loves his new bowls. I hang them in his crate and he has a nice cozy place to eat his dinner.
3,didn't work for my dog but product seems good,I bought this in order to be able to feed my dog in his kennel without him spilling the food/water all over the place and it didn't work. My dog tends to be hyper at times and he will jump off everything in the cage. he was able to knock these off even when fully tightened. They might still work for some calmer dogs but mine is a 6 month old and weighs 40 lbs. Overall good deal for the product
1,Piece of Junk!,I purchase this cup just over a month ago. It is rusting!! The item description says stainless steel and I would hope that something my animals drink out of would not rust! Now it is outside the return window and the only thing I can do with them is throw them in the trash! What a waste of money!! Don't buy!!
1,broke within a week of daily use,The metal ring broke within a week of daily use and the black paint is coming off.I`m really disappointed by the quality.
4,value for money and very practical for flights,"very good value for money and very practical for flights. easy to clean, have it with my pet when we are out and about"
2,Poor quality; at least the bowl works!,"I just needed a bowl to attach to the metal cage. I saw this one and thought it would work. The metal bracket is not of highest quality at all. The metal piece that attaches behind the cage starts to warp every time you tighten the screw. I think part og the problem is that it is cheap metal, and short. It only covers two ""spindles"" of the cage. I only fill the bowl 1/2 full otherwise its weighted down too much. For the price I paid, I guess its ok. If the bracket breaks the bowl is still usable. If you want something more durable, spend a little more and get something that is heavy duty."
2,too small,picture shows big bowls but even 16 ounce just too small for 80lb dog. good only for small pets. wish i could return it.
4,good,"good bowl but I wish the holder for it would clip the bowl into place instead of just sitting there so it wouldn't get bumped out when my dog spins in her crate. other than that, it is the perfect size to allow food to be in the crate while traveling but not enough to allow my dog it get sick."
2,Stainless steel bowl,"I don't like it, I can't get it to stay in the crate, it keeps slipping. We use it as a water bowl in the bathroom outside the crate. There were no instructions for how to put it in the crate so it would stay there."
4,It was okay...,"The screw part was near impossible to screw in enough to get it to stay on the side of the crate. Other than that, it's a great small bowl."
1,Bad ad presentation,"When I ordered this product, I thought I was ordering a set of bowls since they pictured the two items together without saying ""this size cup is this much"", and this size cup is this much"". If Amazon is going to put an ad with two item right next to each other, they should sell them as a set with one purchase total, or tell the different sizes with separate prices next to each. Now I have to go back in and order another bowl and this time get charged for shipping since this order will not be as much as my original one. This is not right."
1,Total disappointment!!!,"I don't write many reviews but I wanted people to know that the quality of this product is not what I expected. I can only blame myself for thinking the picture represented what I was going to get because when I purchased it I was expecting to get two bowls. However there was only one. On top of that, the one bowl only lasted one week before the black metal ring that held the bowl suspended broke off because of a low quality welding job. There was no stress on the ring when it broke, it simply fell off because of rust or corrosion between the weld. I am extremely dissatisfied with this product."
1,Don't bother!!!,"We've tried two sizes of this kennel cup, neither of which will stay clamped to the side of our dog's wire crate. It's been a big disappointment as we had hoped the cup would solve the problem of providing water for our dog when crated that would be easily accessible and not spill all over the place. Since the clamp won't seem to hold and the cup keeps tipping, neither goal has been accomplished."
2,Be prepared to return,"I have bought a number of these in varying sizes. At least 50% of the time, I have to return them because the mounting screws are not threaded properly it makes it impossible to turn the butterfly bolts. I had to use a wrench on one occasion ~ that one was returned. These DO rust as the mounting part is not made of stainless steel so keep that in mind if you are using near or for water. I have some plastic crate cups that work much better, however they cost a lot more money. For the price on these, it is a decent value. Be prepared to return for an exchange if you order this. It is a crap shoot if you will or will not get one that is hard to unscrew and mount."
3,50% chance,"I must say like the ideal of this item, but 1 of 2 broke within 2 weeks. Not sure how long the other one is going to last :("
2,Bracket breaks,The bracket that holds the bowls breaks real easy...it's just a screw and a nut and the welding on the bracket did not hold.
1,TINY,This is VERY misleading! PELASE read...this bowl is only 8 oz which is very small. Maybe big enough for a cat but certainly not big enough for a dog. The picture also makes it look like you are getting two bowls.....when you get it there will only be one in the box. Seems like it is a good quality item...Just not big enough.
2,have some problems,"Bought two of these bowls, one each, for or our Collie's crates. Had a hard time turning the wing nut far enough down on the threaded screw shaft to get the mount to clamp against the bars of the crate. Finally I put a couple of flat paint stir sticks between the oval shaped mounting plate and the bars so I could get it tight enough to hold the frame in place for the water bowl. The other problem is the steel for the mounts is pretty soft and flexible. You can bend the plate fairly easily with your hands. One dog must have bumped the mount which bent the plate and this allowed the mount to become loose. When that happened the bowl turned up on edge and all the water spilled into the crate. The 26oz bowl is not that big. I would not get one smaller than that. It is the right size for our dogs to have just enough water to get them through the night."
1,Can people relax?,"I'm a Christian and I am insulted of this book; I love Harry Potter. God would hate this type of book; Jesus taught about tolerance. And it's fiction! That means not real, they should really be concerned of video games and TV shows, it's great that kids are reading now! Instead of being a couch potatoe, infact I bet Jesus and God would love Harry Potter! God wants us to be happy, and if its not interupting our faith, then he would approve!"
1,Not very Smart,"When will it end?! This book, and others like it, are written by people afraid of all things different, whether it's Japanese culture in the case of Pokemon or British pagan belief in the case of Harry Potter. This is religion gone mad! Yes, Pokemon promotes Shinto & Buddist belief, but what do you expect, it's Japanese. And yes many pokemon are based upon mythical creatures from non-christian religions, but it and Harry Potter are the two best things for kids to be reading cuz they not only entertain but educate. They are also morality tales, just not morality tales that bow down to christian belief. Please, people open you eyes and don't bottle yourself within one relgious standpoint."
1,Terrible Book,"I am a firm Christian, mostly conservative in my beliefs. I am also a good reader. As I skimmed through this book, I was shocked at the number of mistakes the author had made. He was clearly a poor researcher. I have never watched or played Pokemon, so I don't know how many mistakes he made in that part of the book; however, as I read the Harry Potter section, I simply could not believe that this man was making so many claims about the series, using so many big words and sounding so official, when he couldn't even get the author's name right!!! He wrote that ""J.K. Rawlings"" was the author of a series about people called ""Death Enters"", and that a ""Dark Mask"" appeared in the sky. I don't know about you, but I can't take seriously a source that cannot even accurately name the things he calls evil."
2,Good for a few laughs...,"Well, okay, so I had a little extra $ to spend, so I bought this waste of paper. This book was silly to the extreme. ...This tripe by Mr. Arms? Ho Hum. I give it two stars solely for the comedy value. Why don't these people get a life??? It struck me later that I'd actually supported Mr. Arms by purchasing this book. I wish I could undo that action, hence this review..."
1,NAAAAAAAAAANIIIIIIIIII?,Um...okay...fatal? A fatal attraction? The only way it would be fatal is if I walked in front of a speeding car because I was reading a Harry Potter book. ... Saying Pokémon is evil can *nearly* be considered racist because it is part of Japanese culture...and since I'm in love with everything Japanese this is a personal insult. ... I read Harry Potter because it's a well-written amazing story by a great author. And Pokémon is utterly kawaii! ...
1,Give me a break,"First of all, I am a Christian. Second of all, I am a very devout Christian who plans to attend seminary and become a minister. I am beyond displeased with this book and others of its nature. I have not read, but I do not need to in order to know what it says. Saying that these books are about satan worship is a joke. Harry Potter is about the triumph of good and love over evil and hate. As I recall from my studies of the Bible, that is a recurring theme in there as well. As far as Pokemon is concerned, it is a Japanese cartoon that is about friendship and loyalty, not worshipping the devil. P.S. To the reviewer above he said they are no longer a Christian, I say to you today that if you truly were a Christian then you will be in Heaven regardless of what you say now. Also I pray that you will see you have made a mistake by denouncing your faith because of the over-zealous actions of some Christians.Cory Lynn SchiblerEphesians 4:11-13"
1,"If you bought this book, throw it away.","I did not buy this book(thank God), but for those of you who did, throw it away. I am a Christian and even though I am a Christian I enjoy Pokemon and Harry Potter a lot. All this book is going to do is tell parents that Pokemon and Harry Potter is evil, which it is not. I am tired of people saying these two things are evil and things of the Devil. These two things are only to build a childs imagination. I am 15 years old and I enjoy Pokemon and Harry Potter a lot. And to the author of this book, I know you are entitled to your own opinion but I do not believe a word of it. Again, if you bought this book, throw it away."
1,This is truly pathetic.,"This is the kind of book that aims at scaring people into believing what the author wants them to. As with other ""reviews"" I've read (one author actually said that he had not read the HP books, and was thus uninfluenced by them), this person does not come close to grasping what Ms. Rowling sets out to show us, that loyalty, bravery, and brains can win over evil. I was raised Christian, and have not found anything in multiple re-readings to substantiate the claims that the HP books are tools of Satan.Mr. Arms, I suggest that you concentrate on making your own life one without flaw, before you go trying to find flaws in others."
2,A fasitating piece of ****,"I read most of this book, and find it both enlightening and entertaining. This is the book for you if you are an over-concerend Christian evanglist who wants to learn about the hidden evils in children's entertainment, or if you like to laught at them. Its good to know what extactly the world has come to whether you think it is Staten tempting your children through Japenesse games and animation or uber-conservative evangelists who are teaching their children predjuices from a young age and the people who belive anything that can be remotly supported by a biblical quote. By the way, I was disipointed with the lack of info on Harry Potter in this book, i feels as if Phil Arms really wanted to write a book on Pokemon but was afraid no one would buy it unless it included Harry Potter. I could be wrong though, given that I haven't finished the book yet. Have fun reading!"
1,no one is trying to harm your children,"If you don't want you're children to read harry potter and actually expand their imagination then don't let them. Harry Potter is a book based on anything but satanism, if you actually knew what exactly satanism is or have actually read Harry Potter books then you stupid people would understand that it's not trying to make your children satanists."
1,odd.,"I haven't read the book and as being a non religion teen I have no idea why people can't read what they want. Fiction is only make believe where stories are invented by very imaginative people. If you don't want to read that is fine. If you do that is fine also. I happen to enjoy pokemon and Harry Potter among many other things of fantasy, fiction, and more. Nothing is truely evil or good unless you want it to be so. Thank you for reading this"
1,does Christianity a disservice,"This sort of thinking makes Christianity look plain silly. It presents an image of Christians as close-minded simpletons, easily lead by fear. And make no mistake, Arms is out to spread fear - it's remarkably easy to control people who are afraid.As a Christian I am insulted that the very serious subject of good vs. evil is trivialized by comparison to a harmless series of books. The only crime J.K. Rowling is guilty of is getting kids' noses away from the T.V. and into books. As for Pokemon, referring to a cartoon as the work of Satan is simply moronic."
1,Puh LEAZE!,"*comes in wearing a Charmander costume and a Harry Potter wizard hat* Sheesh, I'd rate this negative infinity stars if I could. The only thing I find wrong with Harry Potter is that it swears. *shudder* Anyways, I'm a HUGE fan of Pokemon and Harry Potter AND I'm a Christian. People, don't buy this book. It's a waist of time and money."
1,Pokemon and Harry Potter-A Fatal Attraction,"Author appears to have seen a golden opportunity for financial gain in the Harry Potter controversy.My 5 and 7 year old grandsons have spent hours reenacting the Harry Potter books, but they are quite aware that they are ""make-believe. We all had to learn that lesson with the books we read as children. These two boys have a firm belief in God as our heavenly father and director.Children are much wiser than the author gives them credit for.Let them enjoy childhood, it ends too soon as it is.Don't waste your money..."
5,High quality product!,"I installed this into my Camaro, replacing a worn speaker, and it works wonderfully. The quality of the sound is amazing and it was easy to install."
5,Wow,"it makes you cry, whimper, scream and want to hit the tv screen.but whether you like it or not, they're just like real people...and thats exactly why its so good.no one is truely good or bad, no true right or wrong.i cried for 4 hours when i saw this. its worth it though. every minute, every tear."
4,very good,"the tracks on this album rise and fall from just ""head bop"" worthy, to insane ""twist in wierd ways"" dancing. creative, energetic. enfolds like one entire symphonic track."
4,DJ Dara's Doing What He Does Best,"DJ Dara comes at us again with what he does best -- mixing other people's tracks.This is a good album.It is a really fast paced d-n-b album, unfortunately you'll be able to find a lot of the tracks on other artists' mix albums. But it is still a pretty good album, anyway.However, I was surprised not to see his original track that he did with A-Sides - ""Unholy Grail"" (from his Breakbeat Science record label) on the album, since that is a fairly new orginal 12"" of Dara's."
2,"May do the job, but expect problems.","This is a good machine if you only need to weld a few times a year. As far as reliability, its a lot less than what you would get from a Lincoln or Miller of the same size. Hobart is a division of Miller and ITW. From the inside they are bare simple, but all the parts are extremly cheap. Expect problems. I's suggest purchasing a Lincoln or Miller since they're built with better parts for the money. After the warranty is out you want something thats built to last with few problems."
5,Take me back,"Yeah Buddy, this set takes me back in time - to a simpler, better time. 80% of the tracks on this box set are incredible and the other 20% are real good. These songs are the songs that my friends and I listened to when we were riding around in muscle cars and hanging out at the hamburger joints trying to impress the ""ladies"" - sometimes we impressed them and sometimes ... well you know what I mean. This box set is worth the $. Back in the day the Philly sound was the real deal - like to have a nickel for every girl I said La La to. If you were hanging in the late sixties and early seventies, and going to dances buy this set - you'll be glad you did. If you are a guy it'll make you remember the line ""They call me coffee, cause I grind so fine"" and if you are a lady from that time it'll make you remember some fool like me grinding on the dance floor. Just buy the set - it's fabulous."
5,N/A.,"It is in fact a good book. For those that don't know about Bolivian cooking and its stories, I suggest you try it."
1,WTF?????????,"I was very disappointed with Season 5. This is a great show and the writers/USA network decided--""ok last season let's just get it over with--wrap things up."" As a fan, this season failed to deliver--and only 8 episodes--the series deserved better than that. I have watched it since day one and love the series 1-4 that is. I am soooooo upset with season 5--I don't know what else to say but WTF."
4,Love the Series but NO EXTRAS for S#5. :(,"Really love this show and miss it already. But for such a great show I don't get why they decided not to put Extras on the finale season dvd set. Really bums me out, at least they could have done a 30min spot on how they have enjoyed doing the show and yadda yadda. BUT OH WELL."
5,Great program,Loved the series. Great characters and plots! Nice to watch straight through without commercials and able to view as many episodes cosecutively aa I want.
3,Probably should have ended it a season earlier,"I did like it, but the main character has lost a lot of her appeal. I don't mean physical appearance; despite her baby weight she's still quite attractive. I mean her quirky nature, such as the Ford Probe that she drove in some of the earlier seasons that barely ran and smoked like crazy. Nothing really major, but just a lot of little quirks that aren't there in the last season.It is basically a good show, but season 4 was really where they should have ended it, or not taken away her quirky nature."
3,last episode of In Plain sight,"I really liked the show ""in plain Sight"" because of the primary female character. I was sorry to see the show end. I thought that it would run for another season or two. The problem that I had with the final episode was it was fasely advertised. The episode wasn't bad. They made commercials advertising the last episode that would lead you to believe that the last episode would have had a completely different ending. Personally I hate commercials for tv shows or movies that mislead viewers to expect something totally different than what they end up viewing."
3,Hesitation in 3 areas of the DVD,"Case & DVD's themselves appear to be in good shape. I did, however; discover there were 3 places on the 1st disk that had 'hesitation/freezing' to them. It was a minute amt of time that it occurred, perhaps 3-4 seconds before it would continue. I'm assuming there is a small scratch that is causing the problem. Regardless, I am keeping the product. It's just a small inconvenience."
5,Great Series,I loved this series. I wish it would not have been cancelled. All seasons were well worth watching. They also did a nice wrap up at the end.
4,love this show,I raced through episode to episode! I enjoyed all the characters and felt like part of the family so to speek.
3,Interesting Book On Submission,"I have my first horse at home and I was interested to read this book because of it's Christian based theme. I can relate to the author bringing home a horse, expecting one thing and finding it to be completely different. I loved the Scripture and the discussions of submission and faith as it relates to a deepening Spiritual life.I do have some problems with the book and perhaps that's because training has evolved from the days when the author and her friend trained Fanny. I had to keep reminding myself I'm reading about events from years ago.And I had a difficult time extrapolating the submission of horses to our will and our relationship with Christ. Perhaps, it's because I don't perceive horses as submitting to our will and being obedient with training methods as they are today. I'd like to think it's more of a partnership with us as a benevolent leader but willing to listen to them as well."
1,This is a religous/Christian book that preaches from the very beginning,This book was purchased because it sounded inspirational but in reality is a Christian book that repeats it's message often. I did not get very far and wish I had someone to give the book to but I don't know anyone who would read the book. If you are looking for a book that will drill Christianity in to your brain this is the book for you.
2,Boring,Not at all what I expected. Slow and just a story about this ladies day to day struggles with a horse that she should have never gotten in the first place.
2,Disapointed,I was disapointed in this book. I liked that she talked about her relationship with her horse but I think sometimes it was like too much self preaching. I consider myself a Christian but I think you can turn people off by too much of Bible quotes and sounding like she was on a soapbox. It sounded like she was trying to convince herself. I didnt really like her writing style.
3,Factory Reconditioned?,"The tool works fine, but I question what the definition of factory reconditioned is. The tool arrived with a bottle of lubricant that had the top snipped off. The oil spilled all over the case. All over the lovely inspected by stickers. Who puts an open bottle OF oil in a case and ships it. Did Dewalt actually inspect the tool or just repackage it and ship it out as is? It seems to work fine, but I doubt anyone inspected anything. DO NOT EXPECT FACTORY RECONDITIONED TO MEAN WHAT A NORMAL THINKING ADULT THINKS IT SHOULD MEAN. SPEND A FEW EXTRA BUCKS AND BUY NEW! BUY IT FROM YOUR LOCAL HOME CENTER SO YOU CAN BRING IT BACK IF DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY."
4,1960's Decca Recordings,"A member of the Grand Ole Opry for well over 40 years. Jimmy C Newman has had a long string of hits. This collection features the many hits Jimmy had with Decca records. ""DJ for a Day"" from 1963 was a song by a then unknown by the name of Tom T. Hall. This is the best single collection you will find on Jimmy C. Newman. The ""C"" stands for cajun. Good Collection!!!"
2,Giants flag,"The flag was one sided - meaning when you look at the other side, you see the backward image of the front. Terrible"
1,Vapor DVD,A list of what this DVD has on it would be nice. Is it that much work to read one of your own products. Or is Amazon.com outsourced to some 3rd world country where no one can read the DVD cover?
4,Great but I wish the pages were movable,"This is very nice, with soft pockets for the CD's and clear pockets for the booklets. I'm happily consolidating my cd collection and throwing out jewel cases. I wish there had been a comparable case with removable pages."
2,240 CD ... NOT ...,"Yes, there are 240 slots. They are paired. The front slot is suppose to be for the cover .. and the back slot holds the CD/DVD .. very deceptive ... 2 stars off on that. another star for over pricing the item for only 120 slots item. 2 Stars for well constructed .... I will keep it .. not worth the hassle to return."
2,Bulky,"I was hoping for a nicely molded case, unlike the ugly obese ones that are sold everywhere these days. Unfortunately, what I got was a molded monstrous case that held only as much as my slim favorite old one, in 3X the space. Returning the product.n.b. - beware when you buy from Amazon, because some retailers will have a restocking fee (this pushed me to buy from another site)."
4,Nearly Perfect (can't move pages),"This is a fantastic case - very high quality materials, solid zipper that has held up for years (with light use), soft page materials to protect your cd/dvds. The handle for the case is also very sturdy. Each page has 4 what I will call bays, each with 2 slots. You can use both comfortably to hold individual discs allowing 8/side or 16/page (both sides). Or you could put in the cover art & cd insert in the front (which is clear) and the disc in the back. The back of both slots are a soft fabric. I have been able to stuff two discs in the back slot in several bays (with a disc in the back of the page also). The front slot is also big enough to allow quite a thick insert and front art. the back art may require you to cut down the page size. The only feature I would change is the inability to move pages."
1,Poorly made junk,"I had a very similar experience to the first reviewer, but I didn't bother to contact the manufacturer. I had the same EXACT damage as the first reviewer, BUT it only started there. After I had owned it for a few months, the inside lining of the roof started falling apart. I have owned it for about 2 years and now it is in COMPLETE tatters and is fit only for the trash."
2,TOOTHLESS VAMPIRE FLICK,"DEAD CERT is another entry into the vampire genre that doesn't offer any new blood. Set in the underground of London, the movie focuses on a nightclub owner who loses his club to a vampire and his minions after his brother-in-law boxer is killed in a boxing match.DEAD CERT is filmed with little panache and its script is sloppily written, with an ending that makes no sense. There's plenty of gore and nudity but nothing we haven't seen before. Craig Fairbrass, a veteran from the original PRIME SUSPECT, tries gamely but the writers trapped him in an ill-developed character and surround him with equally ineffective support. Ultimately DEAD CERT is a bloodless misfire I wouldn't recommend."
1,Dematting spray,This product didn't work as well as advertized. I used it before and after shampooing my dog. I still had to take him to the groomer to have the matting behind his ears cut out. It was a waste of time and money.
5,Great Series of Books for Civil War History,"I read this book last year for the !st Bull Run/!st Manassas 150th anniversary of the battle and I truly enjoyed it. It was great to read firsthand, primary source accounts of the history I was already familiar with.On one hand, I can imagine if you told serious Civil War scholars you got your Civil War history out of a Time-Life book, they might look at you funny. But on the other hand, this book is a collection of letters and diaries from people who were there at the time. It's almot like having the war unfold before you on CNN or a blog or something. Plus, there is diversity in the ""Civil War Voices-"" soldiers and civilians; men and women; Black and White."
5,My Last Days On Earth- Just plain Fabulous,"I've been waiting for Bear to put out this Box Set for a couple of, no make that a few years now, so I snaggled it when I got the opportunity. First off, if anyone has a Bear Family Box Set of just about any artist that they have covered you will be pleased with the QUALITY. This Bill Monroe Box Set is the best one yet of the 6 Sets that Bear has issued covering Bill and his recording career. The music is great and there was even some previously unreleased material. The hard cover book (the size of an LP only way thicker) is absolutely awesome. Get this Box Set at all costs...you won't regret it."
4,Good introduction to Italian history from 1700 to the present.,Good introduction to Italian history from 1700 to the present.Worth purchasing and reading.
2,These mirrors don't fit 2007 F150 with manual adjust mirrors.,These mirrors didn't fit my 2007 F-150 with manually adjusted mirrors. The plastic shell was too large and the cutouts incorrect. The mirror came off easily even when fully tightened. Amazon return was simple and hassle free.
3,They would have been nice if they had fit,"They were advertised to fit the truck but they do not, I had to send them back. They looked pretty nice but make sure they will fit before you order them. They will not fit all Ford F150's even though they said it would fit my model"
4,Good product,"The mirrors performed well on my only opportunity to use them. I rated them down one point due to the fact that the right hand mirror will not stay adjusted, it seems to vibrate downward and outward--a minor problem IF I remember to readjust each time I stop. Also, I had to drill holes in the bottom to allow the courtesy light on the bottom of the mirror to be functional. I would suggest that CIPA could do that and it would not be a problem for vehicles not equipped with the courtesy lights. Aside from these two problems, they are easy to install and remove, and improve rearward visibility when towing a travel trailer tremendously.I highly recommend them."
2,Not for me,"They said they would fit a F150 i guess not mine. I returned these if I even tried to use them one the road they would not have been there when I got home. Waste of time. However Amazon was great about the return. That's why I have them 2 stars, only for the return."
4,For half of what I'd pay at the camp store....,"I paid 38$ us for these, they were 80+$ at the camp store, they work great for towing my camper, it's not the best setup out there but for what I do, it works great. On or off in about 1 minute. Can't really complain. I'm happy."
5,great to see...,"Purcahsed these mirrors for our Airstream towing since the mirrors on my new F150 do not quite show sides of the trailer...they go on easy, remove easy, and provide a great field of view for not a lot of money. Great value!"
5,"Contrary to ""Make Sure It Fits"" they do fit 2008 F-150's","When I clicked on ""Make Sure It Fits,"" a 2008 F-150 the answer I got was the CIPA #11800 (pair) wouldn't fit. I even wrote the company directly and they said they wouldn't fit unless they have the LED lights that run along the bottom of the mirror just below the mirror glass. I took a chance & ordered them anyway. I found that as long as they measure the same (approximately 8"" H x 10"" W x 3"" D on the outside) and look like the picture on the http://www.cipausa.com/ website they fit. My mirrors do not have LED's or heaters, but the holes for the LED's present no problem, and they fold back along with the stock mirrors as if they were oem!Great Product!"
5,Killer deal!,"These mirrors are a great addition for towing. They fit very well, are very secure when the retaining wedge is tightened and SO EASY TO INSTALL AND REMOVE!"
2,Mirrors did not fit.,"Although in the ad the mirrors appeared to be the answer to my need, they didn't fit first of all and secondly, the installation kits were wrong. Without the proper installation kit, I could not mount them on my truck and even if the kits had been correct, I don't believe the mirrors would have stayed on while driving. I was not happy at all but the return process was simple and worked well."
3,"They work ok, but are pretty ugly.",Mirrors work as advertised. But they are pretty ugly and will cover the reflector on the front of the mirror. The mirror is pretty small compared to the amount they extend. I decided to install the factory towing mirrors instead and prefer them to the add ons.
4,Mirror Extensions,"The fit is fine, have had a little trouble with the driver's side extension staying on tight."
5,trailer mirrors,these fit great and look pretty good to. works good for someone that only uses there trailer a few times a yr.
4,Mirrors,"Good buy, fits very good over existing mirrors and blends in as a factory appearance . This is my second set, one for my Youkon and now my F 150. Be sure to remove or fold in before entering garage door."
4,cipa 11800,This is a good set of mirrors.But on your web you have to update the years it fits up to 2010 fords.
5,Towing mirror,"These mirrors are a good value. They slip over your existing mirror and are secured by tightening a knob on the back.These are far superior to the strap on style. The strap ons tend to get loose,move around and sometimes come off completely. The CIPA mirrors look good on the vehicle too, as they are ""custom"". I love mine and recommed the to anyone who pulls a travel trailer!"
4,Cipa Towing Mirrors,"I tried the mirrors on my 2005 Ford F-150 super crew. They appeared to fit well over the truck mirrors and seemed secure. Sorry, but I did not yet drive the vehicle to see if the mirrors vibrate, which is why I rated them a 4. But they fit much better than older Ciba mirrors I used on a 2001 Ford F150 super crew. On this 2001 truck, the mirrors vibrated but did not fit as securely as the current ones."
5,06 F150 Supercrew,Use these on my 06 F150 to see around the camper and they are a excellent help in seeing the back of the camper. Mirror stays in place and they are easy to clean the bugs off of.
1,Info incorrect on Amazon web sight!!!!,Cipa 11800 does not fit Ford F150 2006 XL. After I got them and seen I couldn't get them on my truck I call customer Service for CIPA and they said no they do not fit my truck and they didn't have anything that would. When I return them to Amazon they made me pay for the shipping. They said it wasn't their fault so I had to pay.When it was their web sight that said it did fit!!!! I will go to wal-mart in the future and not Amazon..... :)
2,Nice product but not for a 2009 F150,"I bought these through Amazon.com, and the transaction was fine. They showed up promptly. I have owned CIPA towing mirrors in the past, for a different vehicle.Before ordering, I checked the CIPA website, and they claimed they fit 2009 F150 trucks as long as it wasn't a STX. I had a XLT, so I ordered the #11800.They ""fit onto"" the original mirrors, but the retaining system doesn't work/fit at all. Not even close. I called CIPA, and since I am a design engineer, I thought maybe I could help them out in finding a solution. They were not interested in my issue at all. All they said was ""the manufacturers of the vehicles change there mirrors, and don't make it easy for us to produce aftermarket products. If they don't fit return them.""They went on to say that there information showed that they would fit my truck. No offer to help, look into it, etc.I made up my own retention system, and moved on."
1,bad seller,The seller of this product does not communicate with buyer. Have canceled the order and will not deal with Amazon in the future.
5,perfect fit,I'm very appy with the mirror they fit perfctly and and look very good one my truck and do a good job want i tow my trailer
4,Good Product,They fit perfectly on my 2010 Ford F-150. The mirrors provide more visibility like I had hoped. They also look good and are easy to install/remove.
3,Not what I wanted,"I was disappointed that it's difficult to reel the hose in, partly because you need a second person to keep the reel from going backwards as you pause. It also doesn't hold anywhere near 250 feet of hose. It barely holds 150. I bought this at Menards and may be returning it."
2,Cheap Construction not made to last.,"Wheels & shafts miss-aligned, Hose connections leak, crank very weak, reel to hose connection kinks,My 33 years in manufacturing rates this (SCRAP). We where very dissapointed."
3,4 Wheel Garden Hose Cart,"The cart as a whole is pretty sturdy and well made EXCEPT for the handle. The handle is very flimsy and will definitely have to be reinforced real soon with either additional bolts or with spot welds. Let me stress that just as advertised, this is a ""Residential Grade"" cart. I wish now that I had spent a little extra and bought the commercial grade cart."
4,WISH IT WERE MADE IN USA,"ROLLS UP HOSE WITH GREAT EASE VERY FAST, GOES WHERE EVER NEEDED.COMING FROM CHINA THE QUALITY IS LESS THAN IF IT WERE MADE HERE."
1,hunk of crap,"this thing is the biggest hunk of crap. the handle to wind up the hose already broke and the brass plumbing pieces all leak. when you turn the water on, you have to run away from it real quick if you dont want to get wet while water squirts all over the place from the brass fittings. hunk of crap!"
2,It came bent....,"It came bent and I found one at Lowes that was less expensive, even with the tax. So, now I own two. They are sturdy and the wind up is great. I didn't send the bent one back because it is too much of a hassle. Lesson well learned......"
1,Just awful,"Like everyone has said this thing is terrible. Had mine for a year and the handle on the reel rusted and broke off. And I brought it in in the Winter! The quality of the materials used to make this are simply awful, the form factor is great and very useful, but it will fall apart under normal use. Go with something of quality you money will be better spent."
4,Looks like it will be very nice,"""After having what I consider pure junk, a suncast plastic cart, this one looks to be something we will be happy with.But time will tell...Looks very sturdy and so far no leaks or hose blowing off the side like the other folks plastic one did.""As far as a stench from the tires, well they smell like rubber,...and its a hose cart,not a living room decorative piece, so,....so what.?I had no flaking of the paint as one review stated they did...Im not doubting them...but I didnt have that as a problem.The parts for the plumbing of this are pretty standard, so if a problem plumbing wise develops, just get parts from your local hardware store....Its not industrial grade, but I would say moderatly heavy average home owner use and care, and it should serve you well....I was reluctant to spend double the money than the plastic ones, but I do believe we made a good choice with this one.."
3,Solid for price. Need to put a little muscle into it,"So I just bought this item at Home Depot for $79. I read the reviews but for the price I couldn't pass it up. The unit went together very easy. However, just as with other plumbing items, you NEED to tighten ALL areas where water will flow to prevent leaks during the build process. I tightened everything loaded up 150' of hose and bam! perfect no leaks. Very decent for the price. Just need to shop around."
1,This camera sucks.,This camera comes straight from a Chinese Wholesaler and the screen has a blue tint to it so the pictures do not come out right. also this camera is supposed to have 12MP. What camera that is 150 dollars ever have 12MP. This camera is the worst camera I have ever owned. I recommend not to buy this camera. I bought it from a Chinese Wholesaler hoping to get something decent. I had to sell it on here just to get some of my money back. DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA.
5,A Fabulous Historical Review of American Classic Jazz,"Al White has captured the faces and the lives of 120 of the greatest American classic jazz musicians that have shaped the music landscape for the last 30 years.Mr. White is one of the finest jazz historians in the country. His personal collection of over 100,000 photographic negatives and 10,000 autographed photographs allowed him to draw the material for this book from the best of his work. The book highlights three photographs of each of the musicians and it gives a brief vignette that brings these players back to life.If you are a jazz fan or have a family member that is a jazz fan...this beautiful coffee table book is a must have!"
3,"OK phone for the price, not everything works","I just got this phone because I needed a speakerphone for conference calls and I didn't want to spend a lot of money.The speakerphone sounds good, although the mic is very weak. Quality on the handset is good, both speaker and mic.Handset has low and high volume - my phone starts buzzing when I set it to high, so that doesn't work, but it sounds fine on low and not worth sending back.Bottom line - you get what you paid for."
3,For real Church fans,"cons: this is a bootleg, one hand camera, video quality is 7 of 10pros: excellent!!! sound, great performance! of the amazing album priest = aura, great DVD menu design and fonts used on the cover and back.so this is for real fans, thanks to my sister for this gift ;)"
3,Very thin,"These are OK for opening jars -- they grip pretty well. The downside, which you really can't tell from the picture, is that they're extremely thin. If you're gripping anything with rough edges, you'll feel it through the pad. Of course, you can layer these and use 2 or 3 at a time, but that's not as useful as if they had been thicker in the first place. So these pads are good for some things and less so for others."
5,UNFORGETABLE AMALIA!...,"This CD or any other Amalia's CD show us that AMALIA is FADO and FADO is AMALIA.It's absolutelly impossible another AMALIA.God give me the pleasure of see and listen AMALIA !We pray now for AMALIA'S DVDs.Please, URGENTLY."
4,good gift,"Got three for a great price here (around five bucks each). Gave twoas presents for five year olds. Big Hit! At one party the girl opened all her presents then went straight back to this one as her immediate favorite. Her grandmother said the girl had asked for one just days before her party. Can't speak to the durablilty issue since it was a gift, and it doesn't appear to be intentionally educational, just entertaining. My girls like small things like this to carry around in pockets, purses and backpacks. They'll get the third one at Christmas!"
4,Use caution with above reviews..,"The reviewer with posts titled ""Not the one I want"" is located in LA, same as the company whose camera he is promoting. It is more likely an advertisement than a review. Just keep it in mind."
2,Dissapointed,"I was buying this cam as an upgrade to my Axis 2100 cam which I absolutely adored. The image on the 2100 was bright, vibrant, and very clear. The Axis 205 looked like the 2100 only better, so I didn't hesitate to purchase it when I started looking for another security camera.There are many improvements it has over the 2100, it can handle twice the amount of viewers, and has many more options that I wish the 2100 had.However, I was extremely dissapointed to find that the picture quality is not even much better than your standard USB webcam. I tried adjusting all of the settings but the quality improved only slightly.I ended up returning it, rather reluctantly. I can't believe the quality of the picture is so different from their older version of this network cam. Very dissapointing, and not worth it's price."
3,Nice Images,"I bought this deck based on the reviews on this page. I loved the style of illustration - it is quite contemporary!However, the LWB provided with the deck disappointed me overmuch. It does not provide much insight on the story, and the rest is left to the readers imagination.If the makers of the deck have followed any particular storyline or concept, then, the book does not put that across very well. Hence the 3 stars.Therefore it seems to be a mass produced, commercial venture - a deck one can have if one is fascinated by vampires etc., like I am.The makers of the deck could have put in some more effort and made the book more insightful that just a point-wise or keyword-only summary of the meanings of the cards."
4,Great Compilation,"The cd is worth having for Jacinta's hot song ""Destination"". However, not sure why Amazon listed DJ Phil B when the cd was mixed by DJ Brett Henrichsen (which is cleary the name stated on the artwork)."
3,"Good elevation, but a bit stiff","Ordered this pillow to help with GERD. It is nicely constructed, with a good quality zippered cover, and it does a fine job of elevating you head and shoulders. My only complaint (as noted by other reviewers) is that the foam is quite stiff, to the point of being uncomfortable to lay upon. I was surprised by this, as I expected something along the lines of typical ""memory"" foam. This foam is not like any other I have encountered; it does rebound like memory foam, but depresses or conforms much less. I think most people will need to use an additional softer pad on top of this in order to be comfortable."
3,Great,"I bought this product because I thought it'd e similar to what my Physical Therapist used. It was and is perfect for icing, elevating, and relaxing."
3,good attempt in broadening view of hip hop,"jahi did a good job in presenting the elements, representing the culture and furthering the movement to portray a more complete view of this thing called hip hop!! we can no longer allow b.e.t, m.t.v., any other viacom owned buisness or other mainstream media outlets and corporations to dictate what hip hop is!!as one of the organizers of the hip hop generation conference in madison-wisconsin, which jahi recorded & used a good amount of footage from for this video, i completely agree with his title of ""redefinitions""!he added some performance footage of himself, as well as a chapter titled ""hip hop tutorial"", which appears to be footage from a conference workshop, where jahi breaks down the question ""what is hip hop?"" overall, he shares some good information and produced an average video that's worth more for its content than financial power behind production...keep on keepin' on~"
5,Try before you buy,"I disagree completely with the naysayer about this music. Wouldn't a customer with any common sense listen to the samples before ordering blind?Better yet, try G.E.'s MySpace page, where you can listen to full-length clips of the songs on this album (just add /gesmithmusic to MySpace)."
1,No mystery here,"Up to this point I was becoming a fan of G.E. Smith. He was like a train wreck on SNL, weird and maybe a little scary, but you couldn't turn away. Then I read that G.E. had backed up Bob Dylan, a guy who could command the attention of any backup guitarist, and I thought, hey, I've discovered someone here. So, intrigued, I bought his album, Incense, Herbs & Oils. I was pumped up when the CD arrived, and ready to fall in love with this thing. I don't know what I was expecting, but ....this wasn't it. Incense, Herbs & Oils is pretty awful stuff. It sounds, well, amateurish. G.E. sings, but he doesn't have a great singing voice. I think he is best in his role as a talented backup guitarist, but not the lead guy. Of course, it's different strokes for different folks, but for me, the mystery is over. There's a reason you've never heard any of this CD on the radio. It just aint real good. I am real disappointed. Darn!"
1,Pass on this Passbook,"This book consists mostly of old electrician and building inspector tests, and I mean really old, from the 1950's and 1960's. there is nothing to prepare you for GFCI's, nothing about AFCI's, nothing about conduit fill, nothing about derating because of conduit fill, nothing about derating because of ambient temperature, and I don't remember seeing anything about load calculation. If this is your sole source of exam prep you will need lots of luck to pass."
1,A Terrible Edition,"I ordered this text directly from the publisher for my students. Never once did the Dover Thrift folks ever mention that this is the ""cleaned up"" version of the poetry, that Dickinson's own syntax and punctuation had been altered by later editors. Though these edited versions were common years ago, today nobody really reads these versions of the poems except to discuss the stultifying effect that such gender and publication politics had on her work. Please note that there are many wonderful versions of Dickinson's work in print, and that these poems are NOT Dickinson's, not as rich or complex as hers, and NOT even worth a dollar. Find her poems for free online, or go ahead and buy a more worthwhile edition. SKIP THIS ONE."
1,censored,emily dickonson....censored. Her poems were not only the words but all those commas and punctuation marks.
4,Good version to go for,"I have to read this for my English class and this was the recommended version. I like it, it is super portable and has a nice print size. My teacher is unhappy with the way they arranged it and how the formatting varies grammatically from the originals, but that probably won't bother most of us. This is a good price and it shipped pretty fast. Even if it's not for school, how can you say no for $3?"
3,Not worth the price,This is much smaller than I anticipated. It's cheap plastic that should not cost more than 12.99
2,They were friends?,"I must have read something by Meg Wolitzer that prompted me to seek out this book- though I can't remember what. This 10-year old book was weak, and with so many references to HIV/AIDS, rather dated. The characters lacked any real development or, well, character. By the end of the book, I really didn't care if they remained friends (or why they would- they had nothing in common to be ""friends"", and nothing going on to really call a ""life"".)Girlfriends turning 30 and wonder what life is about? Not a whole lot for these three mediocre, ho-hummers.I don't know what the point was with this prosaic book-- there was nothing new, nothing meaningful, nothing deep or even mildly interesting. Pass."
2,Ho hum,"This isn't as good as Volume 1 in my opinion.Too many rinky tink, perky-tangos ie heavily beaty but lacking character."
1,Low Quality Bass for Music - Next...,"I love quality sound and the reviews for this were raving. I first purchased an 8"" Pioneer powered subwoofer from Best Buy, but have a large room so I wanted more punch. I ordered this with the intention of returning the Pioneer. I have them side by side right now. I went back and forth several times between the two subs with familiar music. The Pioneer wins every time! I had to turn the bass all the way up on the BIC (which makes me very uncomfortable) for it to even get close to the Pioneer....and the BIC's bass is all boomy at that volume, even if you try to use the crossover to filter out the mid bass. If you want quality sound for music, stay away from this sub. I payed half as much for my Pioneer SW-8, which I'm going to keep. If I need more to fill this huge room, I'll just order a second Pioneer! I'm returning the BIC."
4,For the price,"The BIC America V-1220 12"" subwoofer is a good buy for the price.It has some great sound and I really like that it has the auto switch on it. The auto switch works as kind of a standby in that when it doesn't receive the bass then its not on but as soon as it does it turns on and stays on as long as there is bass. It has like a 15 minute length of time that it will say on before it goes back to standby. So there is no need to have to turn it on/off ever time.I did how ever also buy another subwoofer (Klipsch 10"" 420-Watt) to kind of compare the two. I got my Klipsch on sale and it was still about $100 more then the BIC, but I have found it to be well worth it. With both hooked up its amazing.Even if you only have the BIC its still a really well made subwoofer and has great sounds. So for the price it's a good subwoofer."
5,This Sub is a Sleeper,"The BIC V1220 Sub Woofer is an unbelievable value. It's deep bass and accurate tone makes it a winner in any home theater system. The subs finish matches exactly with the highly regarded BIC Venturi line of speakers. The correct frequency response is actually 23-180 Hz variable (adjustable crossover), sensitivity is 90 dB powered by a high current 200-watt (430-watts peak)Bash amplifier. The V1220's driver is a 12"" heavy duty long-throw woofer with a high power magnet. After hearing the clean sound this sub produced I quickly decided to purchase a second one. The sound is jaw dropping. I recommend this sub as a hands down winner.Biggz"
4,My search for a subwoofer,"My JBL 200 watt sub quit working recently. I finally was able to get a response from them but it was after the warranty period (several years). If they had been more responsive I probably would not have been looking on Amazon. Regardless, I purchased the BIC after much searching and reading of reviews. I am using it with my Denon 3802 receiver so that I can set the volume of the sub to my other speakers. I have elected to run it a higher volume so that I can hear the low sounds put through the unit. I am satisfied with the unit and would recommend it for purchase to others if they are looking for a mid range (price)sub for a surround system."
4,great sub,So far this sub has been nothing less than awesome. It doesnt seem to kick on when there is just talking on the screen - which IMO is nice. We watch normal tv and blu-ray movies and its nice to have a working sub again.I would suggest this to my friend.
4,"Great Customer Service, Decent Sub.","This sub has been good so far. It had a rattle for a while, then I called BIC customer service and they suggested I take the sub panel off the back and check for vibrations. I did this and put it back together and it has sound fine since. It should not have had the vibration, but customer service helped with correcting the issue. All is fine now. I would recommend this sub for a middle quality sub. Sounds great with our 7.1, 18 speaker system."
5,Awesome Subwoofer.,"Nice accurate sound, not muddy like some subs. Plenty of power, I have the volume at 65% and its great.Played War of the Worlds to test it and was really impressed. For around $175 price point it would be very hard to find a better sub.5 Stars!"
2,Not impressed,"I purchased this to compare to my Velodyne DEQ-15R, not even in the same ball park, OMG. I sent it back!"
4,had it 5 years,"im surprised that none of the reviews have anything bad at all to say about it, its a nice sub no doubt and at a great price, i have it along with the matching dv-84 standers (which are f incredible) and a dv 62 center and dv 64 rears, sexy lookin set i must say. but the sub lets out vibration like sounds like when a speaker is blown from certain tones. its always done it and ive had it 5 years now and its still goin strong just that little quirk, i just keep it turned down if i hear it do it with a song, never does it with movies tho. i always wanted to replace the speaker itself and have a listen to see if theres a difference"
4,not bad,"It starts out too slow, and ends too fast. But the last half is really good. If the second book is as good as the last half of this one, it'll beat Harry Potter."
4,"Excellent book, only the spelling mistakes let it down","As a professional artist, I have a lot in common with Mike Pearson. I open gaps in the market and Mike fills them. This book is a good example of that and show just how easy it is to relate to Canada and it's population.I whole heartedly recommend it, but there are several spelling misteaks (sic) in the book and I would have thought the publishers would proof read it before committing to print."
3,This was cool!!,If you are a mystery lover you will love this video. This is a whodunnit that you have a chance to solve they give you a scenario and then tell you who was murdered. Then after the clues are given you can hear from the suspects and then you find out who did it and how.
3,meh,I don't know if it's that I'm older or what but I just don't find MST3K as funny as I once did. There was one part in this one that made me laugh pretty good but the rest was just kind of ok.
5,Desperatly Seeking Elvis and ME!,Elvis and Me truly packed a wallop! I am desperate to find it again so PLEASE PLEASE re-release it! Priscilla Presley's autobiography truly shined on screen and I will continue my ardent search for the video. PLEASE RELEASE IT !! PLEASE!
5,Elvis and Me,"I haven't seen this movie in sooooo Long. When it first came out I recorded the second part only! I want this movie and have been looking everywhere for it! If you have any information on where I can find it, please email me. Thanks."
5,Dreamy,"This movie was soo fantastic. It's like a dream come true, How many girls at age 14 meet their biggest Hollywood Hearthrob, end up stealing their heart, end up flying down to Hollywood to live with them in their big mansion, and end up marrying them? Ha! It's like any teenager's dream come true! (This gives me hope for DiCaprio and me! haha...well, this love story had it's problems, as do most relationships, but I think any teen, like myself, would love this story...it's one of my favorites!"
5,It's great movie,"I bought this for my sister's birthday gift. The movie is out of print so you can't buy it in store. It's one of those collectable elvis pieces. The tape played like it was brand new. It didn't have any flaws with it what so ever. Other than the case was a little scuff up, it's ok cause a tape case is usually never in mint condition. I give this seller a thumbs up."
1,Elvis and Me,"I never recieved this item, I was refunded my money. Seller canecelled sale. Thanks very much anyway."
5,Best Elivs movie I have ever seen,"Elvis was before my time but this movie, the story of Elvis and Priscilla as seen thru Priscilla's eyes is a heart warming story.I cry everytime I see it. Dale Midkiff does a fantastic job of portraying Elvis as the actress playing Priscilla. She really did love him. A must buy!"
2,Missing a disc,I only received 1 of 2 discs the second DVD in the case was ALSO the same DVD marked number one also
5,Great Source of help,"This is a great book. While it is a little larger than I would want, it has everything I have needed while here studying abroad in Brazil. It has helped me in my school work and with learning new words. Definitely would recommend it."
2,poor quality binding,"The binding completely fell apart after two years of moderate use. So many of the pages came out that the dictionary is no longer usable. I'm looking forward to purchasing a new one, but never again from this publisher."
5,Very Enjoyable,"I found ""Monkey Business"" very enjoyable and interesting. I had trouble putting the book down. It reads very quickly and is not dull or academic in the least.The one drawback I found was that the book is not as focused as Louvish's bio of W. C. Fields, but then here he is following five people as opposed to one.Still, this was a very good book. I liked the way Louvish challenged some old stories about the Marx Brothers, and I liked the way he made a case for Chico being the chief ""behind the scenes"" brother in business matters. His assessment of the films seemed quite fair to me, and I found it interesting that the Marxes (or their writers) originally intended ""Duck Soup"" to be more political, and that they made it after plans to film ""Of Thee I Sing"" fell through.Still, this is perhaps not the best ""first book to read"" on the Marx Brothers. I would nominate Joe Adamson's ""Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Sometimes Zeppo"" for that."
4,Thoroughly researched and a welcome addition!,"Simon Louvish has done an outstanding job of presenting a fun, readable and informative account of the Marx Bros. New information to me included thoughts on the evidence that all of the brothers falsified their ages throughout their lives as well as secrets of Margaret Dumont revealed at last. There is also (as one would expect) a great deal of the story which has appeared in numerous other books and articles. However, Mr. Louvish presents it all in an entertaining way, making this book enjoyable on all fronts.Monkey Business deserves a place on the bookshelf of any devoted fan of the Marx Brothers as well as those only casually interested in their works and careers."
3,Disappointing!,"Extremely well-researched but the writing is awful. His relentlessly jokey prose not only made reading difficult, but it sometimes made his points impossible to comprehend (e.g., the oft-told mule in Texas anecdote). Stick with the infinitely superior ""Harpo Speaks!"", by far the best book on the Brothers, and give this one a pass unless you are a total Marxist!"
2,A disapointment,"Considering an autographed picture of Groucho graces my office wall, I eagerly looked forward to a new look at the Brothers. Yet this volume is largely a disappointment. Louvish's stylistic flourishes (attempts at Marxesque puns, constant repetition of phrases throughout the book) distract from what should be a meaty read. The background on Margaret Dumont is interesting, but that's only a small portion of a 400 plus page book. I ended up skimming the last 200 pages in less than an hour. Ultimately this is a rehash of material better found elsewhere (Try Joe Adamson, Hector Arce, Harpo's autobiography, The Groucho Phile or Stefan Kanfer's flawed but fascinating Groucho bio)"
1,A Cutely Written Book,"This is a cute book but an annyoyingly cute one. Sorry it wasn't written in a more straightforward manner. The Marx Brothers were funny enough without outside ""help."""
5,Absolutely Wonderful,"All my Russian favorites are on here, the Nutcracker suite, Sabre Dance, Polovtsian Dances, and others. I love the Berlin Philharmonic. The orchestra is perfect, the conductor is a joy to watch, and the audience's electric mood becomes part of the music. I highly recommend this as you will be entertained and will listen to good music too. The concert ends with Berliner Luft and Ozawa directing the audience."
1,Get Bruce Fraser's book instead,"""Secrets of Adobe Bridge"" isn't much of a book. It's only 100 pages of content, and those pages aren't exactly crammed with information. There is more useful information about Adobe Bridge in the one chapter of Bruce Fraser's ""Real World Camera Raw with Adobe Photoshop CS2,"" and with that book, you also get all sorts of great information about Camera Raw, too.""Secrets of Adobe Bridge"" is really just a review of the various features and menu items in Bridge. The same information (and more) is in the on-line help in Bridge. The only advantage the book has is that it includes screenshots, which are strangely absent from Bridge's on-line help."
4,Good Missing Manual,"A good reference of Adobe Bridge if you are handling more than photos. Since this is an application that is new to most ""Creatives"" this title stands as a great foundation of an application that may turn into a new type of operating system.If you are an Photoshop expert and photos are your thing - this is may be on the basic side. But if you are more of an Indesign/Illustrator type - dealing with all sorts of things and you are not the technical type - this will be a good reference for an application that will become a staple."
3,This should have come with the software,"There isn't any detailed information in this book, it's just an extended pamplet that should have shipped with the product. I didn't learn anything more from this than just sitting down with the program for an evening and poking around the menus. Powerful program: yes, hard to learn: no. I doubt I will use this as much of a reference book either. I have worked with Adobe products for many years, not as a job but as a hobby, and feel that anyone who knows Adobe products at all can understand this program by just diving into it without a book."
2,Cable dog sweater,"This sweater looks fine; however, my dog HATES the loops around her legs. She cannot walk while wearing this sweater."
3,"Nice smell, but doesn't hang around too long...","Even though I initially bought this cologne when it first came out for no other reason than I liked Michael Jordan, it actually smells pretty good. I wore it for about a year back then, but then wore Hugo up until a few weeks ago when I bought Jordan again. My only complaint is that the fragrance doesn't seem to hang around too long or be strong enough to really matter.With certain colognes a lot of people smell you (in a good way) without having to have their nose at your neck, but with this I have yet to receive a compliment for smelling good, which I would get often wearing other colognes. In fact, the only person who has ever noticed it is my girlfriend and only when she is really close to me. So yeah, if nothing else you don't have to worry about smelling bad, but at the same time you could do that without wearing cologne at all. Overall, good smell but just doesn't seem to have much kick."
2,"Almost no text-an Audubon ""where's Waldo""","I purchased this one the grounds that it was a Caldecott winner or runner up or whatever. I was disappointed. I like the illustrations, which are of a marsh, and have some very realistic illustrations of birds, badgers, salamanders, etc. but there is almost no text. The whole idea for this book is to find the missing baby duckling on the page, someplace, as it hides behind a log or whatever in the background. Sort of a ""where's waldo"" for a duckling. So far my one year old has not caught onto this, and seems really bored by this...Here is the total text for the entire book, with numbers denoting pages.1.Early one morning...2. none3. none4.none5. none6.none7. none8.

3,Just ok. Has most of what you will want.,"Ordered slightly used book, but was like newWith cover and not a single mark. Returned fromGermany East and West and wanted to recaptureThe foods and try at home .Could not finda German book in English while in Germany.The author gives her perspective of recipesFrom a multi- cultural perspective with recipesFrom her German mothers family . Her father is Tunisian.This appearsTo be a good all of Germany cookbook, highlightingThe different regions. The instructions areClear and does not use the metric system soNo conversions needed. I am not sure there areAny little secrets in the recipes and there are noPictures. I think I will end up cross referencingHer recipes with others online and embellish as neededBut the book is a good starting point to anIntroduction to German Common Foods."
1,Do Not Buy This Product,"I bought this chainsaw at a local Home Depot because I liked the sturdy carrying case & the overall quality seemed good. That was a mistake. Even tho' the box says ""easy fingertip-pull starting"", I had to pull the cord with literally all my strength with both hands before it would turn the motor over. My 22 year old son could not pull the rope at all. Once I got the saw going & let it warm up for several minutes, the engine would die after a couple of minutes sawing. It didn't make any difference whether you throttled up or not...it would die & not start again for 5 minutes or more. If you pointed the saw tip down to the ground, the engine would die, if you pointed it up vertically, the engine would die. Needless to say, this saw is going back to the store tomorrow & I'm never going to buy a Homelite product again."
1,Homelite UT10580 Chainsaw,"I purchased a Homelite UT 10580 chainsaw which turns out to be a HORRIBLE product. When new it was a bit troublesome starting, but I wrote it off to the new engine. Wrong, it got worse. It stalls out and wouldn't start when warm. I took it to a repair shop and it was okay the next time. Now it barely starts cold and won't start hot. It won't use all the gas out of the tank so you have to keep filling it. And, yes, when you shut it off to fill it, it won't start again. A real piece of junk and I'm trading it in today for a Stihl or Husgvarna."
5,If you RV and don't like to work!,If you've ever tried to clean the underside of a RV awning you'll find it better be summer and your in a bathing suit. This product not only takes all the scrubbing out of the project but after you put it on you can back out rinse with a hose.This is truly a product that can save you a lot of work.
3,Risk Management & Contract Guide for Design Professionals,"This book could be reviewed while revising or developing general contract clauses. Risk management & design is not referenced in a technical or engineering manner. However, there is emphasis on insurance policies and the generic structure of contract documents. In summary, I would recommend this book to junior Contract Engineers and Insurance personnel as apposed to Design or HSE Professionals."
1,Cheap looking!,Doesn't have hair on the side or in the back just a small row of hair at the top. looks awful. I was ashamed too have given it as a present.
3,it's ok,"Not a bad little doll. Personnaly I wish it was a little bigger. The sound is great, you can hear the voice clearly. My daughter didn't bother with the bracelet but it's a nice option.The only complaint I have is the hair - if you lie the doll down with the hair messed up, then that's how her hair stays until you comb it."
4,Nice Dora,"This doll is kinda small, but nice. It's made out of cotton, except for the head. The verses are clear, and plenty of them. My daughter enjoys playing with her, and sticks her inside the ""Dora Backpack"". This doll is worth the price! The smile on my daughters face, priceless!"
4,Dora,She is so cute!! My granddaughter will love her---Christmas gift. One thing---she only says a few phrases. I expected her to say more than that.
3,EXCELENT,"perfecto tiempo de entrega, el estimado se realizo tal cual como se señalo en el momento de la compra, excelente"
4,OMG...,Ok I received the Dora doll today and let me tell you I was pleasantly surprised. It was about the size that I expected but seeing it in person was more than I pictured it would be. My 2 yr old daughter absolutely loves it and for the price there is no comparison. It says 3 phrases like advertised and it came with a backpack for the doll and a surprise in it as well. It was delivered a day later than guaranteed but it was in new condition as promised. I would definitely recommend this to anyone in the market for a nice Dora doll...
3,The Dora doll,"I purchased this doll for my grandaughters 3rd Birthday, since she loves Dora.I was kind of dissapointed when it got here. I didnt realize it was so small, also it said it talked.When it talks it is so faint you cannot even hear it. I also thought it said more then just three little words,my grandaughter being so young still loves the doll and carries it everywhere."
2,I Expected a Little More,The Dora saying are cute but she only says 2 or 3 things. The doll is very small and the head is hard. The hair on the doll looks like it was attached as an after thought and the clothes are not even close to what the Dora character wears on her show. My daughter loves Dora but not this Dora doll.
2,Good but not great,"We bought this as our daughter wanted a Dora doll for Christmas, and all the rest of Dora dolls were even worse. The toy appears to be well-built and very similar to the character, but is a little too small. I think it is a very average doll and priced higher because of the Dora brand."
4,Dora review,"This Dora doll was pretty close to what I was looking for - a doll that looked like Dora in her original outfit, etc. and still fun to play with. My daughter loves this doll and the bracelet that came with the doll is fun as well."
5,Christmas GIft,I gave this to my 3yr old daughter and she Loves it so much it was required to go to bed with her.
4,Grandbaby loved it,The main thing was the baby liked it...mostly because it was DORA period. It was definitely worth the money paid.
3,Average quality,"I thought the doll was bigger and better built that is was, I guess for the price it was OK"
2,doll to small / but she loves it,"my grandbaby loves this doll comes with a toy in backpack and a braclet for your child to wearI on the other hand think that it was a waste of money/ hard head, soft body and to small/ only says 3 words not to educational"
2,toy wouldn't work....,this toy would shut off every once and a while.. waste of money. i like to eat crayons!!!!!
2,talking dora doll,"We got the Dora doll for our granddaughter thinking it was going to be more educational. It only has 3 sayings so it isn't too exciting. But, she is soft and cuddly and is a good likeness of Dora."
4,Cute; cheaper elsewhere,"This is a really cute doll. I wanted one that looked like the TV character, and though her clothes aren't exactly the same, she's pretty close. I found her at CVS for $22."
2,Fun for kids but price is not,"got this doll for my 2.5 yr old daughter who likes Dora. I have to admit that she likes this doll and carries it around(perhaps that's what matters ?). However in terms of price ([...]) I think it is cheap/poorly designed : Head is too big, hair is short/cheap and the hood does not come of easily (which my daughter sometimes wants to remove). So overall, just an ok doll charging extra for the Fisher-Price brand name but without quality."
4,talking doll,"brand name, cartoon character, talking doll, entertaining to pre-schoolers, good imagination toy, a bit more than I wanted to pay, quality is good"
4,Messy hair Dora lol,"my only complain is the hair, it got messed up 2 minutes after my daughter opened the box. i tried to brush the hair but it never back to the way it was. bad hair day for Dara everyday LOL. probably not good for 3 year olds, should be better with older children that knows how to take care of the dolls."
3,My kid loves it!,"As much as I dont like spending big $ on dolls, my daughter wanted this for her bday so I got it for her. She loves it. She still plays with it 1yr later. Quality is pretty decent as well."
4,Sporty Dora is a Great Surprise,"You can't go wrong with a Dora doll. And I love this sporty look. Dora still wears her signature pink and orange, but in a long-sleeved hooded sweatshirt and nylon sweatpants. Her legs and arms are soft fabric. The head and torso hard plastic. My 3-year-old daughter was so excited to find her very own Dora bracelet hidden inside Backpack.Squeeze Dora's tummy to hear 3 phrases:""Hola, I'm Dora.""""We did it! Lo Hicimos!"" and""Swiper, no swiping!"""
3,WAY over priced on here!,"Alright I just picked this up for $[...] at khols. It was on sale and I had a coupon. So at that price sure it's great. My 19 month old really liked it in the package I am holding onto it for Christmas. She says 3 things. ""Swiper no swiping"" and ""Hola I'm Dora"" and ""We did it"" says it in spanish after english too. But it is the actual Dora voice. The body is soft, the head is hard. The tummy activates the voice and that is where I hope my daughter will be able to work it come Christmas time. I am afraid that she will lose interest in this but for $[...] oh well. My 5 year old did mention that the cloths were not right so she doesn't like her but the doll is not meant for a 5 year old."
4,It's a Dora Doll,"What little girl doesn't like Dora?Although Dora appears to be going out of style, young girls still seem to enjoy her. Good toy, good price."
2,Dora,I was disappointed in this toy. My granddaughter ignored it. I could not understand what Dora was saying. The backpack was hard to open even for adults.
3,Granddaughter loves the Dora the Explorer Doll,"For the size doll I think its really expensive! I would only give it 3 stars at most. As far as my 21 month old Granddaughter, she would rate it 5 stars! She really likes it, and thats what really matters!"
4,Adorable Dora doll for toddler,"Brought this for my 2 years old and she loves it. She wears the bracelet and uses the play camera daily. The doll is a perfect size for any child. Only bad thing I would say that Dora on speaks four phases. Would give it 5 stars if it could say more phases but overall, still a good buy."
1,Dead Batteries,When my daughter opened this Dora for Christmas Dora did not talk. I guess the batteries are dead. Not a nice surprise for a girl who was expecting Dora to talk.
2,Not so great mouth guard,This Night guard feels like your could swallow it in your sleep and choke to death. I have had acrylic guards made to fit my teeth and that snapped into your top row. A much safer alternative to the over the counter variety in my opinion. Be prepared to pay heavy for these. After bitng thru my acrylic guard over the course of a year or so of consistant use I decided to short the dentist and try one of these over the counter guards at a much reduced price. I found it was very hard to use and it floats around in your moutn and eventually to the back of your throat making sleeping with it a difficult if not impossible task. Thats my .02 on this particular guard. I may try another brand before I succumb to going back to the dentist for another acrylic version but this one didnt seem like it was worth the money.
1,Early model without the hard durable surface,"This is the early model with the soft surface, it has been improved.The Doctor's 3 Pack Classic Night Guard Teeth Grinding ProtectionYou cannot beat the price or the quality of the new style if you go to the link.The old style is easy to put a hole in during the fit and does not last long. The new style has a hard and durable surface that lasts for years, you will want to change it before it wears out to keep a fresh new one in your mouth. I recommend replacing it twice a year."
3,not what i was looking for,"I was suffering headaches from a temporary increase in tooth grinding due to stress. The product fits well and was easy to mold. Unfortunately, I was able to grind through the hard material while sleeping rendering the product useless within 7 uses."
2,Doctor's NightGuard,"I ordered the Doctor's NightGuard Dental Protector For Night Time Teeth Grinding. I had used this device before & was very happy with it. For this order, I was shipped the older version, which has a Blue Disposable Molded Tray attached to the bottom of the Protector.The Doctor's NightGuard Dental Protector for Night Time Teeth Grinding, Large, 1 eachThe tray stops you from expending the Protector's width or length. I have returned the unopened one for credit & The Doctor's Night Guard is shipping me a replacement for the one that would not fit. Make sure you order ""The Classic"" or Advanced Comfort"" (one size fits all)."
4,Better than paying 400 + at the dentists office,"I do not have joint problems - just teeth grinding so getting the $400 custom fit seemed a bit absurd - the other reviewers apparently did not read the directions or the manufacturer has modified the directions to account for their concerns - dipping the mold in cold water for one second eliminates the ""scalding"" problem and using your fingers to mold the product and ""sucking"" in as directed really helps shape the mold to fit your teeth and the shape of your mouth. I also followed the directions and trimmed the mold before boiling in hot water so it did not go beyond where my teeth are (wisdom teeth gone). It took no time at all for me to get use to the mold - No real complaints other than I grind my teeth in the first place - and thus need something like this."
4,MUCH BETTER THAN THE ONES AT THE DENTIST OFFICE,"I have been at the dentist almost six months trying to get a night guard, but my experience was not good. So far, they have made three of them without any success. All of themstarted moving all my teeth and the biting started getting spoiled. On top of that, the cost of such night guard was U$ 340. I decided to give this one a try, and even though I had to try it twice, I finally could get the shape I needed. It is true that it is somewhat bulky and that sometimes it takes more than one to get it done well, bu it works MUCH BETTER than the one at the dentist office - which is adjusted by the assistant, not the dentist - and is also way much cheaper. It makes no sense at all to pay hundreds of dollars for just a piece of plastic that, as in my experience, does not work."
1,The Doctor's NightGuard Dental Protector is horribly uncomfortable!,"I followed directions and have tried unsuccesfully to sleep wearing the Doctor's NightGuard. It is too thick and bulky and too hard. It forces the mouth into an uncomfortable open position. I trimmed the back edges but that didn't help. I wish I could find one that is less bulky and a bit softer. Since it's guaranteed, I'm going to try to get my money back."
1,The Doctor's Uncomfortabe Night Guard!!!,"From: Doug & Colleen RileyI had no problem molding the guard!!! But it was so tight feeling that I could not get use to it, and I couldn't sleep with it- I would just keep waking up!!!After a week or longer I stopped trying!!! After being uncomfortable and sleep deprived!!!I hope this helps people that needs something for grinding and clinching etc!And I hope the Doctors and or another Company could get something not to tight and Comfortable!!!One star for your effert!!!Thank You"
1,Baby size,"I ordered med. size thinking I had an average mouth. Very small, maybe a good fit for 10 yr olds, not for adults. Order large or extra large."
2,Poorly constructed material,"I bought one 4 months ago (yes, I wanted to 'save $$ too'); it came two in a pack. what a deal! WRONG. The first one actually SPLIT upon its initial fitting - meaning, the top & bottom layers :(Had to use the 2nd one immediately. This one seemed to work out. NOPE. Weeks later the bottom layer split again! The package 'warrantee' states 90 day satisfaction. I sent them a negative email.Don't waste your $$"
2,Doctors NightGuard,This didn't work for me at all. It had an awkward fit and I followed directions exactly. It was uncomfortable and I do not use it. It hurt my mouth to have it in.
4,Grind Guards are Great,"I liked this particular brand of night guard better than the one I bought before. However, I only gave it 4 stars because you really have to pay attention to the sizing. And that is where the minus one star comes in. I don't know HOW anyone could gauge their size really. It says if you are ""this"" tall and weigh ""this"" amount then ""this"" size is for you. It didn't work for me. I should have listened to my dental hygienist sister as she once told me I had a small pallet. Ah well. I'll try again. The BEST part about this night guard is that it's CHEAP! And it's even easier to mold than the last one I bought on Amazon. Just follow the instructions to a T and you'll be fine."
3,Great for the Price,"This is the older NightGuard (which must be why it's so cheap). I've found that the newer NightGuard (with less material around the front and more material towards the back) is more comfortable and lasts much longer. However, if this is your first NightGuard purchase, I'd suggest getting this kind because it's so much cheaper! Then you can see if it works for you, how you like it, what the fitting process is like, etc. before investing in the more expensive, more comfortable one. Frankly, the only reason it makes a difference to me is because I've been wearing a NightGuard for years so I can tell a difference in the subtleties. So in short, I'd take a newer NightGuard over this one, but this NightGuard over any other brand."
2,"Fit is fine, but not durable","I followed the directions and was able to get a good fit. The problem is that within days, the plastic began to split and crack. It isn't worn through, it's just cracking at the tooth crowns."
2,HARD PLASTIC!,I've used these for five years and noticed this time the plastic wasn't as pliable as in the past. I thought it too hard and will not purchase again. The instructions were quite clear and it was easy to fit but I didn't find it comfortable.
3,Follow the instructions,"Make sure you get the right size, you don't want it too big. The problem I had with mine was it was too narrow. When I was molding it, I could have pulled it apart, but I didn't because i thought it would just do it by itself. The forming went well, the instructions were good. It falls out at night sometime, but I think that is because I didn't spread it apart. Another very important thing, make sure to suck in, it getts rid of all that extra space from the saliva, and if you don't, it is very frustrating at night."
4,Good but Smaller than most Larger ones From the Past,"Always good protection. But the sizes seem to vary, from small thin to heavy thick (large). I like the Large size as it is more comfortable and provides more grinding room. Last longer too. The one I received should be the Large, was labeled as Large but look more like a Medium. Smaller than my past Large ones. Still a great guard. And Medium works great in the mouth. Just want a larger one ..."
2,The Doctor's Night Guard,I could not get this item to fit comfortably. It is a poor substitute for dentist-made bite guards.
3,It's okay!,"I bought this product because I have been grinding my teeth for years (not all the time). It was my first time using a product for teeth grinding. I had a hard time keeping it in my mouth closed - I am not one to sleep with my mouth open - so needless to say I spent most of the night trying to close my mouth and trying not to drool! I guess if I gave it a chance, it would work. If I want to stop grinding my teeth then this is the price I have to pay, using a mouth gaurd."
2,Keeps you up at Night Guard,The Guard was cheap. That said it is so large that I am unable to fall asleep with it in.
3,Very bad product,"Very hard to adjust,size medium is for huge people, don't waste your money and time with this item."
2,Just spend another $30 and get the better one,"My husband tried to use this to prevent teeth grinding at night, but was not happy with the result. You have to boil it and then follow exact instructions to get the fit just right. If you can possibly afford the additional $30 to get the $60 type of night guard, go for it. We ended up buying him that one in the end, and he's much happier with it."
4,MOUTH GUARD,This mouth guard worked wonderfully. You heat it in hot water and then press your teeth into it to make a perfect mold for your mouth. It is a bit bulky but I didnt have to trim mine. Although if you need to it would be simple to do if you have a very small mouth. This device saved me alot of pain. After wearing it for just a couple of weeks when I slept I didnt have to wear it anymore on a regular basis. Now I only use if I start grinding my teeth badly.
2,"Good merchant, so so product","I ordered this product for my wife, but she is not using it as it seems a bit too large and uncomfortable."
1,Not for me...,This guard is easy enough to mold and trim yet has too much mass to be comfortable for all night use. I always wake up in the morning with my guard on the floor because I take it out in the middle of the night due to the discomfort. It also gave me headaches and ear pain from being so bulky. I did trim significantly however due to the nature of my small mouth it is simply to bulky.
3,ok,"For some reason, I purchased the large. I probably should have gotten the medium. Unless, I was shipped the wrong item, of course I didn't check. Anyway, I had to use a razor blade to cut away the access. Which there was plenty. But it works for what I need. But for some reason, I get more dry mouth. I had the old version of this with the peel off bottom. It worked a lot better that this newer version. But there is no choice, no one else had that feature. So it 20 something or you can get one from your dentist for 200 something."
1,fits like a hockey puck,This product is terrible. I bought one and never got a good fit. Could not even close my lips. Even the small size is huge in your mouth. Save your money.
1,I Still Don't Know How to Shave.,"This book looks great and has tons of photos- it is an enjoyable collection of eye candy. Do not expect any new info from this one. The text describes what the author might imagine this time was like, instead of alowing the reader to draw their own conclusions."
2,not impressed,"i bought ""the track record ep"" along with self against city's ep, and to make a long story short, i wasn't impressed. The problem is; these guys are pretty generic. i listen to alot of pop-punk-rock kind of music, and because of that, it's easy for me to spot the more generic acts. The vocals aren't too impressive, and the music tends to take off in different directions, rather than just sticking to a steady path. Another thing is the production. The mixing and recording are terrible, and the music tends to drown the vocals to an almost background like noise. Although there aren't any tracks i'd consider filler, the album as a whole just isn't good. Even though self against city's ep has one song i consider ""filler"", the other 5 are much better than anything on here, so i'd recommend it over this one. Better luck next time, guys."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"Generic, overproduced, commercial, mediocre emo. It's the pedal they use to make their non-distorted guitar parts sound like synths that I really hate. If you want to make synth music, play a synth. If you're going to play guitar, use it like a guitar, don't process it through an effect so you can make the most insipidly soothing and palatable sounds you possibly can, because the sound of an actual guitar is too abrasive for your wussy prettyboy ears. This band's existance disgusts me."
4,Sump Pump,Delivery was very prompt. The pump works well. Customer service was helpful and polite on the telephone when we had a question about the installation. Pump did not come with instructions.
2,Pumps fine but not long lasting,"I have had three of these. The four screws on the top of the motor are rust-proof and make the thing look like it is well-built. Flip it over and all the screws on the bottom are rusted out after 1 year. Also, Home depot carries it so you know its not a high-end product. One of mine died, the float switch in the other one died. One still lives on with a Little Giant float switch."
1,"New pump failed, I flooded","I bought this pump 2 months ago. Last week, we got 2 inches of rain on 2 consecutive days. That's not enough to have challenged my last sump pump. This one failed, I had an inch plus of water everywhere and it is not covered by insurance (the rider pays $1000 max). Had the part fixed, and it did it again!!! Waiting for their customer service dept. to open. My insurance company thinks they're liable. Who knows. Buyer Beware!!!"
3,A good machine but don't believe the hype.,"I bought a G4 Powerbook a few months ago now and it is a fine laptop; very useable, very attractive, superbly designed and very expensive!BUT:I had my first Powerbook replaced within a month due to a faulty screen and now the one I have has developed a dark area on the monitor and the hinge is sticking. Research on the web indicates I am not alone, not by a long stretch. Unfortunately Apple is not the benevolent customer-lover it would like us to believe and charges 35 for each and every customer service matter within the first twelve months. I hope the replacement I get is sound but I must admit that I wish I'd paid half as much for a high spec PC.Don't get sucked in by the Apple charm, take a step back and consider."
1,disappointing,"I bought this machine principally because of the UNIX interface as I am usually disappointed with portable PC linux installations. Well this is worse. It worked fine for about a month then I did a routine software upgrade a recommended by Apple. Now everytime I use the mail utility or ssh to another machine, all open programs crash.In short, the concept is good but the execution stinks.Other design issues. Unix users need a three button mouse. No excuse for the single button on this machine.It is too heavy.It runs too hot. It will burn your lap after about 15 minutes.I will shortly be sending this back to surplus and have my lab buy me a (much lighter) Windows machine. Maybe I will try a dual XP/Linux boot again..."
5,A Truly Refined Laptop,"An excellent piece of engineering combined with a truly elegant operating system and applications. I have owned laptops from HP, IBM and Toshiba and this unit takes the cake. Very fast, silent and well built. The airport extreme 802.11g is very fast and the bluetooth works well with the Apple wireless mouse. The screen is beautiful and the backlit keyboard is nice when you are sitting on the couch typing in the evening. I expect to keep this system for at least five years. Well worth the investment.Purchasing advice: Spring for the 128MB of video RAM and upgrade the main RAM to 1GB. This will cost an extra ~$180 or so but it is an inexpensive way to maximize performance."
3,concerning double-memory promotion,"Hi,If you are considering to purchase this PB because of Amazon.com's recent (as of 6/29/04) free double-memory promotion. Be aware! This configuration of PB comes with two DIMM slots already filled with two 256MB modules, and there is no open slot left. So, even if you get another 512MB memory module for free, in order for you to add it, you will need to remove one of those pre-installed 256 MB modules. So, that means instead of having 1 GB memory that you are dreaming about, you will only be able to upgrade it to 768 MB, which is not bad. In fact, that is how much I have for my iMac at home running OS X 10.3 Panther. In the end, you will have an extra 256 MB module.Anyway, I just wanted to bring this to your attention."
4,great castle,"the castle is easy to put together and take apart. My 5 year old and friends play with this on a regular basis - I can see this being used for a few years. The downside is that the the full size figurines are much too big for the castle, you will need to find the very tiny knights."
4,Great Castle,Overall a great toy. My boys have been playing with this castle on and off since Christmas. One of the plastic pegs has broken off due to a bit of abuse (what do you expect from young boys). I would recommend this castle over any that I have seen. Over all sturdy. It breaks down so it doesn't have to be up all the time taking up room in our small home.
3,"Review of ""Trick or Treat Murder""",This book features female-sleuth Lucy Stone and is set in October. There is an arsonist loose in the small Maine town of Tinker's Cove and the book follows Lucy's efforts to catch him or her.I like the way the Halloween theme was used in the book. There was a lot of emphasis given to Lucy caring for her baby and of her trying to find the time to do everything she needs to do in her busy life. I felt there could have been more emphasis on the mystery part of the story.
3,Typical mystery...easy to foretell ending,ho hum...........kind of know what's coming next..........what mother of such a young family and good husband would take stupid chances....not very believable
3,Like some of her others better.,"This is ok, but is moving a bit slow for me. I'm 77 percent through the book and it's taken me a couple weeks to get that far because it just isn't holding my interest consistently. There are so many details about her family life. Lucy's husband goes out of town for business. Lucy makes macaroni for dinner. The kids watch TV and don't want to help. The baby keeps crying. The baby has a fever. Her son's room is a mess. The kids demand she figure out a Halloween costume. She's always taking the baby in and out of the car and in and out of her sling. I don't know. It just felt so slow moving and I wish there was a bit more mystery in it. There's a lot of hum drum daily life details. But maybe it's just me. Anyway, I liked Meier's Wicked Witch Murder better."
2,Mystery for Mothers,I came across this book by accident and it looked interesting and this is the first book I read in the Lucy Stone Mystery series and will be the last. What is with all the breast feeding? I am sure she was trying to portray a real Mother but I do not think it was really necessary in the development of the mystery.
3,Fun Read,Parts of the story were unbelievable if examined too close. But it made me want to live in New England and it was a cozy book to read.
4,Enjoyable Maine Mystery,I enjoy the main characters and the Maine setting. It is a fun book series to read. I recommend reading the books in order.
2,"Cheap, but beware.","I've known several people who ONLY use this type of lamp because of the great value. Having 7 reptiles, we do go through bulbs. I find this lamp to be far lower quality as compared with others, and to not last as long. To increase product life, definitely don't touch the bulb when you install it (like a halogen there) or it'll burn out. Use a kleenex or oil-free cloth. One month I had 7 of these bulbs burn out in my different tanks less than a week after installation. Not very promising. Even when they do last, they don't last AS long as other products. Recently, I have just chosen to go with the incandescent blue bulbs... they last a lot longer and are far less fragile, although they don't ""direct"" the light as well."
2,"Inexpensive, but short lived","Title says it all. I use these bulbs for my beardie and Anoles. They are fairly cheap, so I can afford to replace them fairly often, which I unfortunately have to do.I use 50w, 75w and 100w. Have yet to have one go past 2 months. If I ever have one make it 6 months as others say they do, I'll be ahead of the game.They either sit on top of the screen or are suspended by a light stand--I don't move the light fixtures or screens at all (front door on tank) and I am careful enough to use a cloth when I screw the bulbs into the socket so as not to leave any finger smudges on the bulbs.As a bulb, they do provide heat and it's pretty focused and not lighting up the whole room. Just wish they lasted a big longer."
1,Engineered to fail after 1 - 3 weeks?,"I have purchased 6 of these spot lamps from Zoo Med since Christmas (son's geckos and blue tongued skink). Not one of them has lasted 3 weeks and I had one fail after one day. At ~ $7-8 each, I smell a rat. (Luckily rats don't need a basking lamp though or they would be dead by now.) DO NOT BUY THESE - well, unless you are independently wealthy, have oodles of time to shop online, love getting frequent packages, or making multiple trips to the pet store."
1,Very pleased so far--UPDATED; NOT PLEASED,"I've had these bulbs installed above my tortoise enclosures for about two weeks now. They are much brighter than the Exo Terra lights I had previously. This is my first attempt at using Zoo Med lights and I like them so far. My tortoises seem to enjoy basking under them as well. Right now I have them in a normal inustrial clamp style lamp from a big box store. However, I will be buying theZoo Med Combo Deep Dome Dual Lamp Fixturefor theZoo Med ReptiCare Ceramic Infrared Heat Emitter 150 WattsI have.Update 10/29/12: After less than 4 months of having these lights on a 12-hour daily timer they have both burnt out. I've never had a reptile light last so short of time. I would not recommend this light. I will be order two of these:Exo Terra Repti-Glo 10.0 Compact Fluorescent Desert Terrarium Lamp, 26-Watt. It only merrits 1 star and that would be soley based on it's price point."
1,"Cheap, but you get what you pay for","I've used their 50 watt bulbs before without too much trouble, and because my turtle is getting bigger and my lamp was rated for up to 100W, I decided to try the brighter bulbs. The first bulb from the two pack burnt out within three days. Okay, fine, my bad--I installed the bulb with my bare hand. I was more careful with the second bulb, and made sure not to touch it when I installed it. The new bulb started *buzzing* this afternoon. I immediately turned it off, and noticed that a crack had formed in the glass. I don't know whether this was a factory flaw or whether it was damaged in transit, but regardless, I am *not* buying these again."
3,Price wise its ok,For the price its a great product but my only complaint is the bulbs busted from too much heat I guess while having them on just a few hours.
5,Great bulb,"I like these bulbs as they do what reptile bulbs are supposed to, they generate heat and light. Theres not to much else to say about them lol. They shipped fast and both are in working condition when they arived. They are also alot ALOT cheaper than buying them at Petco. I Buy all of my bulbs on amazon and have saved i would guess about 300 bucks over the entire time. If you need some 100W bulbs these are the way to go."
1,Don't Bother,"I read all the great reviews, and thought it would be okay to purchase fragile, as are the bulbs. When they arrived, glass shards were falling out of the unopened box. NOT a good sign. I'll just have to pay expensive store prices."
3,Basking Lamps for Reptiles,"They were a great price I didn't pay unought attention to the add I wanted red and ordered whit my fault, Thanks"
4,works,I've only used 1 bulb. It sounded like it was broke but it worked when I turned it on. I wish they made these to last.
4,Zoo Med Reptile Basking Spot Lamp,"My beardie is very pleased with this spot lamp so I've given it another shot. This will be my third purchase of the value pack in apx. a years time. If I don't have better results with this value pack of bulbs, I will switch to another brand. The previous bulbs did not last the alloted time. On the off chance the lamp may have been the problem, I purchased a new ceramic spot lamp after the second bulb blew. The third and fourth blubs also blew before their alloted time. Hoping for better results this time around."
3,Cheaper then anywhere.,"These lights work well, cheaper here then at the pet store, overall happy and will get again. Came safe and sound, no broken lights."
3,not to happy,i got one of these at a pet store and it lasted for a long time them i ordered these and the first bulb pnly lasted 3 weeks so im on my second one already.. maybe it was just a bad bulb but for the price i would have liked for it to last a little longer
5,100 watt bulbs,"This was a good buy for my iguana and snake aquariums. They were not cracked due to the protective wrapping and were much cheaper than the pet stores,"
2,Two bulbs burnt out in about a month,"I've used Zoo Med bulbs before but sometimes they burn out so quickly I have to wonder why the inconsistency. I use one at a time and both bulbs that I got on about March 13th are burnt out as of yesterday (April 19th). I'm disgusted by this extremely short lifespan and will probably try something else now.Other than the short life span, the bulbs seem to give my turtle the light and heat she needs and enjoys so I had no complaints about that."
5,"Good Book, even if you're not a Niner Fan","I've never been a 49er fan, but I've always admired Jerry Rice for his skill and work ethic. There has never been a better wide receiver. I was pleasantly surprised by this book. Jerry doesn't shy away from controversial opinions about team mates and other players and he addresses his own mistakes and shortcomings in an up front way. I also appreciated the way that the book went beyond the usual sports bio in terms of teaching good life lessons based upon what the athlete actually learned through experiences, good and bad. Having rooted for Jerry in Dancing With the Stars, I was also intrigued by his motivation for doing the show and enjoyed the behind-the-scenes information and analysis of his experience there."
2,Go Long!: My Journey Beyond the Game and the Fame,"This book was not nearly as substantial as I was led to believe (not by Amazon). There was a lot of self-adulation in the book, and it was not very well written."
1,A Sleeper,"Told like it written by a grade school student. Not enough detail behind stories. Obvious Jerry has a high opinion of himself. Seems like the biggest thing that changed his lfe was DWTS, not winning 3 super bowls. Very dissapointed."
5,stride rite,"I used the measuring guide on line and ordered sandles for my son. The fit was great, the turn around time was impressive and the price was better than the Stride Rite stores. Did I mention free shipping?!I would definatly buy through Amazon again.Deb"
4,"love em, but could be wider","these are great sandals, my son has WIDDDDE feet and the XW should fit however these are a bit snug, too bad they don't come in 2XW..........."
4,Finally a new type of game!,"This game is un-like any other I've played on the PS2. It's challenging at first, but after you master the controls, it's very fun. It's a good premise and the story-line and action are good."
1,"Review of ""And the Dead Spake""","I didn't realize I was paying that much for a 19-page short story. I love E.F. Benson but wtf? I would definitely have passed, had I but known."
3,An anime that is not for all tastes,Demon city is a mixed bag of anime. The story centres on the life of a young kempo swordsman who must travel to the forbidden city to avenge his fathers death. Aside from this typical storyline the anime features some exellent voice casting and memorable people such as the angel Mephisto.It has it's downside though.The main critisism is that the story might not appeal because it lacks the depth and scope of more established mangas.Anyone interested in this type of anime should see the superior Wicked city.Although this is still a worthwhile purchase for anyone who likes horror anime.
3,The movie was okay but the comic book is better.,"This animation movie seemed to have condensed the Japanese comic book edition that left people lost if they have not read the comic book series. Overall, the movie was not bad."
4,"Not quite five stars, but still a good watch for Anime Fans","Wow . . . great movie. When I first saw it, I wasn't an Anime fan, and I liked it. I watched it again recently and got into it even more. Though it is a pretty typical story and the animation and dubbing are not near the class of say, Tenchi Muyo, it is easy to get into, and the plot hooks your curiosity immeadiatly. It's like the book you can't put down. You have to know how it ends.Though the romance between the main character and this girl (I can't remember her name) in an UGLY pink dress isn't very well developed and kind of jumpy, I liked it. There is mild violence; Evangelion is like, 10 times worse, to give you an idea of what I mean by mild.I'd recommend this to any anime fan, regardless of what they prefer. This movie has everything."
3,"More ""F"" Bombs you can shake a stick at","I bought this movie thinking that it could have been a PG-13 Rated Urotsukidoji (Legend of the overfiend), which is to many otaku as the trailblazer to horror hentai such as La Blue Girl and Cool Devices...Animation is exactly what I expected. From the Mid 80's, on par with Galaxy 999 and if your expecting quality animation, this is not it.The dubbing is by part the worst dubbing I have ever heard (next to the Magic Knight Rayearth theme songs). These characters say the ""F"" word like 16 times, most of the time gratuitously. I was expecting so much more out of the plot, but it let me down.This is truly the movie the never could - Put this on your rental list above ""Crying Freeman"" or any of those horrid MD Geist movies."
5,VHS Shipment,This is la late review but everything came as ordered in a timely fashion. I have 0 complaints and will be a return customer.Thanks
4,rememberable,"I sat up to watch this movie on the Sci-Fi channal at midnight, and I dont feel it was a waste of sleep to finally turn in at 2:00. I cant remember all that much of the plot (I missed the first 20 minutes), but the fight scenes stuck in my mind. Plenty of sweet moves and they really took advantage of not having to film with a camera. Not much blood though. I would recommend this movie someone easing themselves into the anime world; no unessisary gore, no dirty little rape scenes, and the chick in the movie wears a pink DRESS. You wont feel like a little pervert after seeing it."
4,"Violent, fast paced and action packed","Demon City is a mesmerizing, and very stylish film, detailing the journey of a young swordsman fighting through a nightmare city to find his lost master, accompanied by the president's daughter. Surly and foul-mouthed script is given a boost by the unique, strange characters which people its world, best of which is Mephisto, the slick shaman who throws his lot in with the unlikely hero. Extremely dark and violent, but very well acted and animated."
5,DEMON CITY : SHINJUKU,"Possibly one of the best anime's on DVD, next to Ninja Scroll, this tale of evil is very interesting and action packed...but kinda short and a not too bad ending. But the most think i got a kick out of was the Spider demon at the near middle of the film, this thing is wicked."
2,Huh?,"I just finished watching this movie, and I have to say that it is the worst voiceover job I have ever heard (except for PS2's game ""Orphen""). It wasn't only the dubbing that threw me from this film, the story was also pretty uninteresting comapred to a lot of the other anime films out there.I just cannot reccomend this film to anyone except the people I don't like."
2,Not that great...,"Being an anime fan (check my top 25 list) i wasent suprised at the quality of this movie. What did suprise me was how many people consider this a good anime.The poor animation, lackluster story and typical characters make this movie nothing more then a bad copy of already bad horror/anime.The storyline is so crammed and condensed that theres not much point in paying attnetion to it.Ive watched the movie time and time again, each time finding something new out. But this isent always a good thing, atleast not in this movie. Infact each time i watched it i had less and less respect for it.So i gave it 2 stars1 for all the unnessasary violence (seeing as how this is a major attraction to younger anime fans).1 for the story attempt"
4,Moderate.,"You know, this film is kind of like every other anime. Dark lord wants to destroy world, two people save him. The film itself, I would give 3 stars. Yet the end is the best. That little guy roaming the world, and all those really weird art in the background? COOL! That's the reason why I gave it 4 stars. Fun, and not a long, dragging film."
4,MB3 - Jazz Hits Volume 1,"Great arrangements done by some top notch session guitarists and sidemen. Very original treatment of Miles ""All Blues"". Closer ""Killer Joe"" makes you dive for the volume knob."
4,Very informative book,"Information in the book brought together years, models, engines, performance, and dollar guides for a better understanding of these Porsche types. Recommended for a novice as well as long time car buffs."
3,No place to hide?,"I have two ferrets so I thought it would be nice to have 2 hammocks. One is the one you see in the picture and one is a covered hammock with a small opening for them to tunnel into it. I thought that they would each like their own, but I was wrong. They both want the hammock that is covered. I found them always squished in their together or fighting with each other over it until I made a cover on the ""open air hammock"". Now they don't squish or fight and they each sleep in their own. I recommend buying a covered hammock in the first place."
1,Navigation??,"This book is really not about Navigation at all. It's just a bunch of pictures of sites. I bought this book hoping to find examples of good navigation, and how it was designed, but did not find this at all. There are some neat pictures, and I guess I got a few good ideas, but the title should be different. It's not good if you're looking for in-depth information about navigation."
2,The Best Cheeses in the World,"My favorite of the sampler was the Bulgarian feta. Its rich and creamy taste is incomparable to any other cheese. And the Balkan Kashkaval, with a mild, nutty taste, is just awesome.The Bulgarian Cheese Sampler makes a great gift for any cheese aficionado."
1,Don't order from this company,"I ordered 2 citrus peelers on Dec. 14. There was some confusion with booking the order and I had to follow up De. 21st. They sent their apologies and said the order was shipping. It did ship but I got 2 pot drainers instead. I contacted the company on how to handle the mix up but go no response. I love these citrus peelers, which is why I wanted buy them. So, the peeler is absolutley great just don't buy if from MV Trading company."
2,Doesn't last,"This thing was not made to last.It's styled like the old Tupperware orange peeler (not the current one), so that's why it gets as much as two stars. But the pointy part that pierces the orange skin wears out badly. Some things from Pampered Chef work VERY well, like the pizza slicer or the tomato knife. This thing? Skip it. Doggone it."
3,Buyer Beware,"I have a Pampered Chef Orange peeler I purchased several years ago and love it so I thought I would get a few more to share with friends. The peeler I have has Pampered Chef written on it and it is orange. The orange Pampered Chef peeler I ordered from MV Trading does not have the words Pampered Chef anywhere on it, the plasitc is not the same quality and I got a blue one, white one and yellow one. I was mislead with their advertising and will not buy from them again. Buyer Beware!"
5,amazing orange peeler,"Just place the curved stem under the orange skin and rotate , holding the fruit firmly.It is like carving from underneath and this is one amazing little tool.Have not tried it with really thin skin oranges,but with a decent thickness to get under, it is a very workable little product."
1,Is this thing supposed to be disposable? (FAIL!),"Used it once, and the little hook that digs into the skin broke. So it worked for one orange. I've owned other pampered chef products, this product does not live up to the pampered chef quality / brand. You can achieve the same level of customer satisfaction by flushing your $3.99 down the nearest toilet."
5,Pampered Chef,"You can not go wrong with this product line. I am a true believer if you want a product at a fair price that is going to last you a long time to come, go to Pampered Chef."
1,Great idea poorly executed.,"I had a similar product some years back and loved it. It made sectioning and peeling navel oranges very easy. This product looked liked the one I had, but it not as large and not as well made and not worth the cost of shipping! Extrememy disappointed."
4,Good book..,"I think this is a good, clean story of Gladys Aylward's life.I could tell it was written for a younger audience because it seemed to ""glorify"" Gladys. It was an extremely Christian text which was nice and encouraging. It wasn't as much a page-turner as the Trailblazer book on her life, but nonetheless, it was good. I recommend this as a read-aloud to kids also."
1,Not impressed...,"I've used this product and it only works the day you use it. It does not stay long, not even the for the following day. The shine goes away quickly. I am actually searching for a new tire shine. They say the gel works better."
5,Cannot go wrong with Meguiar's,"Pros: I always use Meguiar's to shine my tires which leaves a better shine than what you get when you take your car to be washed. My tires stay shinning for days.Cons: Strong odor when shinning your tires, but my tires look fresh.Other Thoughts: I saved about $2 - $3 buying it online which saved me a trip to Autozone."
3,"not bad, not great","I use meguiar's products on my car's interior(dashboard and leather), and I love them. This however, is not the best tire shine i have used."
4,Nikon 7900 user,Great battery to use when traveling...as long as you bring along enough to last for your trip.Last MUCH longer than the rechargeable battery that comes with your camera....how much longer you ask? about 1 day longer with constant turning on/off from my experience.
4,Well. It works but...,"Hi. It works but doesn't work for a lot of photos. I have a Samsung U-CA3 that uses these batteries, but one battery lasts approx. 50 photos. So, I don't know if the battery or the camera is defective..."
3,Duracell CPI CP3553 Lithium Battery,"This battery does not last more than 50 photos. Personally, I think its quite expensive for it durability. Also, I am finding it hard locating retailers that carry it. I wish Samsung, the camera manufacturer would ensure adequate battery supply for its products at various merchants."
1,ugh,"this battery is awful! the amount of charge wears out too fast. I can't even view my pictures at an event, because the battery wears out so quickly. between pictures i have to turn off the camera. on top of all this, you can't find this battery anywhere! (unless you order it online) it is too expensive for how it performs. i bought a very cute digital camera at target. the guy didnt tell me about the battery until i agreed to purchase the camera. when i asked for a spare battery, he told me they dont sell them there! STUPID. the only place i have found this battery is at wolf camera. ONE TIME! i have ordered many online now. it sucks. not a good battery to need. i wish i hadn't bought the camera for 300 bucks! one battery is between $11 & $14..ordering online gees..$15 to $20. horrible rating for a horrible battery. duracell, you can do better!"
2,"Great size , Poor Quality, Worse Availability","I love the size of this battery, however it doesn't last long and is almost impossible to find anywhere but online."
4,This is a great basic soup book!,I enjoy trying out some new recipes as well as some classics. So far every soup that I have made in the book has been a winner . Ms. Rhodes' instructions are clear and easy to follow.For anyone who enjoys a great soup this is a good start.
5,Souper!,"There will be no surprises with this cookbook featuring soups from around the globe- No bad surprises that is! Each recipe is accompanied by delightful photographs showing each step-by-step instruction.All the instructions for recipes such as Passatelli, Pesto Soup, Pavia Soup, Shrimp Bisque and Pumpkin Soup are clear and easy to follow as well as those for old favorites like French Onion. So why wait?These series are a must-have resource for those who enjoy cooking and culinary art, both photographic and gastronomic!"
4,Cool gift for a Rush fan,This was a good gift for my husband who is a big Rush fan. It would have been awesome if I could have got a larger poster print.
3,Modest price and marginal quality,"The flap football belts have met our needs but are not the highest quality. When using them with high school boys, several of the flags have been ripped. They have only been in service a short time so I do not expect to get more than a year or two of use from this purchase. I had hoped they would do better."
1,Bad Quality,I have started using these flags in my P.E. program and after about 6 days of use they have begun to tear and rip off the belt. It's not just happening to one or two of them either.I'm teaching abroad and now the equipment I brought is a hastle. Very disappointed.
5,Celebration of Life,"With dynamic music and texts that speak to the heart, Lorraine makes herself one of the most relevant song writers of today. Drawing upon her personal experience as well as the ancient song writing tradition she is part of, her texts are remarkable classics, multifaceted in meaning, so one does not tire of hearing them again and again. Well done!"
1,Not the item but the Seller,"If I could have given OVERSTOCK_DEALS.COM a lower rating I would have. I ordered this item, 1 box of 100 UPS Structural Connectors RT7-TZ Hurricane/Seismic Anchors, three (3) times, each time I received only one anchor. I complained to Amazon Customer Service each time to no avail. I received refunds and promises of investigation and correction of the problem from Amazon Customer Service, but it didn't change anything. OVERSTOCK_DEALS.COM apparently has a bunch of dummies working for them that cannot read or understand their own product description. What a lousy way to do business.This is the first time I have been disappointed with an Amazon purchase and Amazon's customer service.This is also the last time I will trust OVERSTOCK_DEALS.COM, what a bunch of numbskulls!The product, on the other hand, appeared to be a very sturdy anchor. Wish I could have received them."
3,Some glaring omissions,"This book has many wonderful photographs, but they can't all be trusted. For instance, there is a photo of a 1969 Lincoln convertible, but Lincoln didn't make a convertible in 1969--this is a custom. Plus, the photos don't really have any order within the articles that they appear.The biggest omission, however, is that there is no section on regular family cars. There are luxury cars, sports cars, muscle cars, economy cars, etc. However, the bread and butter sedans are missing--my parents 1961 and 1968 Chevy Bel Air; Buick le Sabres, Ford Galaxies, Olds Delta 88s--all missing in action. Oh well, it is still an enjoyable book."
2,"SW Bell GH5822 cordless phone, a very poor choice","I was in the market for an economical two handset cordless phone without an answer machine and this came highly recommended. However, sound quality is terrible and the volume is low. When you speak into the phone, there is a loud echo into the earpeice that makes conversation quite difficult. It is definitely not a phone that you want to have more than a very brief conversation with. My prior phones have been Panasonic and I think that I will go back to that brand; this phone will be banished to the garage for occassional use only..."
4,"The Lieutenant - The Complete Series, Part 2","As a retired solider, I enjoy most all of the military based television programs. This one portrays some good things and some difficult things about military life."
1,This doll is ugly!,Omg! This doll is sooo ugly when i saw her i got freaked out but her dress nice. But her face is soo ugly her make up is yuck(barf)i gave this doll a one. She deserve it!
4,Portuguese Princess doll : Barbie,I gave it to my niece for her birthday. She loved it. The costume is beautiful and she has a Juliet cap that is very romantic.
4,She's Ok,"I don't know for some reason I feel like Mattel didn't put enough time and energy into this doll. She's not unattractive, but I think the company could of made her a little more elegant. I still purchased her to fill my collection, but not one of my favorite. Good Educational value."
4,Portuguese Princess,The Portuguese princess is overall a lovely doll. There was nothing that jumped out at me that was postive or negative about this doll.
5,She Loved It!,She was not as cute as some of the dolls in the collection but the little girl we gave it to did not seem to care. She was thrilled when she opened it and loves play pretending she is a princess.
1,I THOUGHT it would be good,"I read reviews and thought this would be a great item, but I was disappointed.I ended up returning it for a different piece of equipment.I was very disappointed."
5,Awesome and easy to use,This is an awesome item. It is so easy to use. Take this from someone who can't even boil water.
2,A Quesadilla Maker? Why?,"A Quesadilla Maker? I can't imagine why.Another specialized item to fill the kitchen cabinets to eventually meet the fate of your Presto ""Hot Dogger"" in the givaway pile or yard sale? Can you imagine the cleanup of a generously stuffed quesadilla once squashed in this contraption?The BEST Quesadillas can be made in an oven/toaster oven at 350 degrees. For cripsy, place it on alluminum foil on cookie sheet and heat until cheese melts(as an option, flip after 5 minutes for even cooking). For soft, place another sheet of foil over the quesadilla and cook until cheese melts. Cleanup is simply, throw away the alluminum foil!"
2,Difficult to clean,"I wanted a quick lunch idea for my kids. The heavy top, makes the filling spill out into the sides. The appliance is sooo difficult and time consuming to clean. There's a groove that goes around the outside of the grill that is impossible to get to. It's much easier to make quesadillas is a flat skillet. I wasted my money on this item."
3,Old fashioned is sometimes better,"I am know for my homemade quesadillas and I thought this appliance could help cut down on my kitchen time during gatherings. While it is easy to use, it's no replacemnent for my skillet. First off, you can't fill the tortilla very full or the lid won't close and all the goodness gets spewed all over your countertop- not exactly a time-saving manuever! Second, because the tortillas have to be kept practically empty, they cook to the consistancy of tortilla chips. So, if you really want fancy chips then go for it! If you want quesadillas, stick with the skillet."
2,Should have known better...,"...when we saw the display at Target had a broken latch. We've had ours for less than a year and the latch broke a little over 4 weeks after we bought it. Past the point of return.I paid full retail price. While I wouldn't say it's worth the full retail price, at the sale price listed here on Amazon, it's worth giving it a try.I have a 3 year old son who refuses to eat meat. But, diced up nice and small and hidden in a quesadilla with cheese and veggies, he'll eat anything. This is a handy little appliance with kids, but be wary - it runs very hot! My husband burned himself twice - once with escaping steam and once on the cover itself.This appliance is a space-hog and hard to store when not in use, but for $15, it's worth trying out - at least for one party!"
3,Quesadilla,"OK. The only thing about this machine, the front flap falls off right away. I bought two of these, one from Amazon and one from Target.If you make these once in a while, it is worth your while to pick one up.Its cheap enough to afford and gets the job done. It comes out nice, looks great if you are entertaining and place them on a platter on the table.Shipping is always quick with Amazon."
4,finally!,Been trying to get a hold of this kitchen gadget for about 6 months and the price on Amazon was just unbeatable. This product satisfies in all aspects and is an excellent snack preparer. Slightly hard to clean with the mess and lacks a bit in the aesthetic dept.
4,worthwhile purchase,"I recently purchased this quesadilla maker and have been pleased with the results so far. It heats up quickly, and with a non-stick surface is easy to clean. There are a few downsides: the thicker you make the quesadilla (or the more ingredients you add) the machine does not perfom well. You'll have to put some pressure on the lid to get it to flatten out. We made quesadillas with cheese, sliced olives and sliced jalapenos and it required pressure to get it to cook. Making the quesadillas is messy, and after every quesadilla, the machine has to be cleaned. It does wipe up easily, but it still takes some time to clean up. For the price of this machine, all the negatives still make it a worthwhile purchase."
4,A Pleasant Surprise,"This was an impulse buy after shopping for a food processor. It was on the best buy list and, after reading the reviews, figured it was only $15 so what the hey. Well, it is well built, easy to use and makes a great product. The kids had a blast making their quesidillas. One word of caution, it gets HOT! Let the kids make the quesidillas, but not come close to the iron itself. Also, do not overflow with toppings or try any dessert quesidillas with pie filling - a lot of the filling leaked out and made a mess!We'll be buying several more for Christmas presents! Too bad the price went up $3..."
3,"Good, but could have been better","Not a bad addition for college football season when snacks are at a premium. We tried the recipes included and were pleasantly surprised at the results. Hot (VERY HOT) quesadillas in minutes flat with a minimum of preparation time.However. Don't overfill. There is a gutter on the outside and that works well, but if the goo (i use a generic term here) overflows the gutter then it heads into a crevise between the gutter and the outside of the case...and its REALLY HARD TO CLEAN.On the whole though a good purchase and one that will be VERY useful in the coming months. Just watch the overfilling...."
2,It's okay but not great,"I've used my quesadilla maker a few times now and the shell always seems to harden up unless I put a large amount of butter on it. And it has only cut though the shell once and it only cut two or three pieces. It does make the impression that it will cut your quesadilla while you cook it, but it does not. It does heat up quickly and will cook your quesadilla in a few mintues but the quality of the hard shell isn't worth the convience of the quesadilla maker."
1,Terrible,"You cant put too much of anything in. Kinda steams it, Tastes' better just making them in a pan.Save your money!!! Reminds me of the Sandwich hot pocket makers from the 80's taste."
3,The Sante Fe Quesadilla Maker gets a little too hot,"IT's nice if you want just a Quesadilla with cheese, but if you add the chicken the Quesadilla burns."
4,pretty good,"the dilla maker is great except it dosent cut the quesadilla for you so it is a pain to cut it, but besides that, it is great"
5,Santa Fe Quesadilla Maker,We really love this product. My kids are on the go so much with school activities and this is the perfect quick snack. It is very versatile in the items you can put into it. We really love it.
4,Another fun kitchen gadget!,"This is great! This makes for fast lunches and dinners. Our favorite is pizza quesadillas- spaghetti sauce and cheese between the tortillas. Very tasty. Kids love what this quesadilla maker creates. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is hard to find the balance between perfect number of ingredients and too much. It can be messy to clean up if the filling overflows. I wish it could hold more toppings. However, for such a fast meal maker, I will overlook this flaw!"
2,Not that great but...,"that's what you get for the price! We can't stuff the quesadilla too much because the hinge is too tight. It's impossible to clean it well because the sauce goes under the ""gutter"" and you can't reach it! Not a good design."
3,Works well but....,"It's a good idea to have a second person helping out with this. I have found that when the lid is open, it has a propensity to fall shut, causing a very disarming slam. Worse yet is the probability that your adjusting of the quesadillas caused the lid to close in the first place so your hands could be in the path of danger. Now some people out there might like having their hands quesadilla'ed, but, more than likely, the metal plates will be hot causing some pretty good burns (or at least one good one).If you have someone there to ensure that the lid stays open, then there is no reason to not use this quesadilla maker.This review may make me sound like a klutz, but the lid doesn't open much past 90 degrees. Also, my wife has encountered the very same problem.Nothing like a design flaw to detract from an otherwise good quesadilla maker."
4,Great snack maker,"We have enjoyed the versitality of this quesadilla maker. It works well for what it is, a snack maker. Our grandchildren love it for a quick snack when they get home from school. You can try many different fillings or just plain cheese. It works well."
5,Much More than Quesadillas!!,"I thought this looked clever, and it works fine for quesadillas, but it's actually a fantastic all-purpose appliance. You can cook waffle dough in it, batters, biscuits - whether homemade or bought, scrambled eggs, muffin doughs, bar cookies, croquettes made with leftovers and eggs - it really works sensationally well for a huge variety of things. I can't eat wheat, but I bet bread dough would make great Indian naan bread. I haven't tried making fritters (like grated vegetables in batter) but I am certain it will do a fine job. It's inexpensive and extremely useful. It's also very quick - I can make good waffle-pancakes in under 8 minutes where it takes my waffle iron 12. I recommend this to everyone - and experiment with even more possibilities!"
1,Impossible to clean,"This product has a SERIOUS flaw, in that there is a small gap between the heating plate and the base of the unit that extends nearly the entire circumference of the unit. What does this mean? Unless you are VERY careful when putting in the filling, it will drip over the heating plate and into the space and down into the base of the unit. I spent 20 minutes trying to clean it, and I finally unscrewed the unit to get the filling out of the base. This was the only way to clean the unit, otherwise it would have been a breeding ground for creepy-crawlees. Anyway, this product is virtually useless, unless you are perfect in adding filling. It's not really worth the chance, in my opinion."
4,"Easy to use, and to clean","It is very easy to use, and a cinch to clean. I like the way it seals the quesadillas. The only problem is that after only 2 uses, the latch cracked in half. I am currently in contact with the manufacturer to remedy the situation."
4,I love Quesadillas,"Since I have purchased this Quesadilla Maker (6-7 months ago), I truly have to say that my household uses this thing atleast once a week. My roommate doesn't cook much so this is the easiest thing for her to make. Also, whenever i have a small gathering of people over, they always make a special request for Quesadillas.It's an instant party each and everytime, plus it's easy to use and easy to clean. The only gripe that I have about it is that there is no On and Off button/switch. So whenever you use it, it comes on automatically when you plug it in. That seems a bit dangerous to me, but that is it's only flaw. Still I would have to recommend it, especially to those that wastes money buying ...quesadillas. Why pay someone else, when you can do it yourself!"
2,Disappointed,"When I add the recommended amount of cheese & salsa, it bubbles out of the side and makes a mess. The Quesadillas taste good, but having to clean up after each one makes it more trouble than I expected. Reducing the filling amount helps but you end up with a very thin Quesadilla. I like the idea of this product but overall this particular product did not meet my expectations."
4,Quick and easy food,"I purchased this quesadilla maker for my wife for X-Mas. She just loves it. You can make a quick and easy meal for yourself in as little as 6 minutes with this baby. The first meal we made was a bean, cheese and onion quesadilla and it was a golden brown in less than 5 minutes. Easy cleanup as well. Do NOT fill product too full, as it will melt out everywhere creating one helluva mess if you are not careful. In addition, there was no instruction manual with recipe suggestions in our box, so I called and emailed the manufacturer and still haven't heard back. All I want is the recipe book for some new creative ideas.Fast shipping and quick processing as well."
4,Mmmm,"I ordered this Quesadilla Maker because it was so cheap and looked like something fun to try. I have had no issues with this unit. My one minimal complaint is that the Quesadilla was not ready when the ""ready"" light turned on, it needed to be cooked a little longer. It still worked pretty quickly. The rubber handle on top also gets VERY hot if you try to close the top without a potholder on."
3,Fragile on the lid,Well I put a whole on the top of the lid while using it for the first time. You have to push down on the rubber area so you can lock it in the front. If you push to hard the plastic area under the red rubber will give in. The first Quesadilla the I made I over filled slightly so that one made a mess. The others that were made came out better. Well worth the $18 that I paid for it. I would have given this 4 stars if it had not broke on the first try. It is worthy of 3.5 stars but I can not give a half a star on this rating system.I will edit my review to let you all know how Salton handel's the warranty issue once I contact them.
3,I love kitchen toys but I can live without this one...,"I really needed to HAVE this machine and I used it with great joy a dozen times right after purchasing (because I love great kitchen helpers) but I have to honestly say I could live without it. The quesadillas get a little hard or brown and flattened when cooked in the grill and you can hardly use any filling so it doesn't result in a great quesadilla. Also, the ""divider"" doesn't actually do much good because you have to cut the tortilla anyway, just mashes it down and makes it a little crunchy. So my teens and I prefer to throw a tortilla in a pan now and I'm about to give the machine away."
3,You get what you pay for,"After discounts and special pricing that particular day this quesadilla maker cost me $10. For $10 I cannot complain about it's performance. It pretty much does exactly what it says it does in the instructions. Unfortunately, it's not really spectacular at doing it. There's almost nothing to be done here - plug it in, wait for it to heat up, put down one tortilla, put fillings on top of the first tortilla, put the second tortilla down, close the lid, and wait for it to cook. What's wrong? Well, it's almost a guarantee that the fillings will leak out the sides, making a mess in the unit. The instructions list a maximum filling size of 1/4 cup, but I have found even LESS than will squeeze out the sides. And honestly, I find that 1/4 cup of ingredients (say... cheese only) does not make much of a quesadilla. So in conclusion - there's nothing WRONG with this unit, but be prepared for a mess if you want to make a quesadilla that has any decent amount of anything in it."
4,South of the border munchies!,"A quality appliance, just be sure not to over fill it, as you can make quiet a mess. it also works quiet well for making scrambled eggs for breakfast tacos."
4,Good Device Well Worth Trying,"While a quesadilla maker has obvious limited uses, this product does produce a good result that is tasty and actually fun to make. Our family has enjoyed using the device and we have found that a wide variety of fillings make a quite nice result. The device works well and is very easy to use and clean. If you think that quesadillas will be liked by your family then the Santa Fe Quesadilla Maker would be a good choice."
5,"Say ""Si"" to the Santa Fe Quesadilla Maker","I love quesadillas, but when I made them, they were messy. The Santa Ve Quesedilla Maker effortlessly makes a very neat, very good quesadilla and clean-up is a breeze."
1,it will break - poorly engineered,The maker works great...but only for a short time. I have tried two of them and both times after about 15-25 uses the clasp used to close the lid during cooking cracked and broke making the unit unusable. When I returned it to the store they said that they get quite a few returns. Save your $ until the manufacturer gets it corrected.
5,Fast and Fun,"I love this machine and have been using it like crazy since we got it earlier this month. The quesadillas are fast and easy and it allows you to be very creative in your ingredients. Clean up is a snap and it stores upright. I know a lot of people are against having machines that have only one use, but I find this to be a great item to make fast and filling dinners."
3,Convenient but not w/o problems,"I got the quesadilla maker from another site on sale for $10, so I really can't complain too much about it. But I'll share my first experience. Cons: the standard flour tortillas seem to be too big for the machine, too much filling causes food to squoosh out onto the edges and counter, nonstick parts are not removeable so best way to clean is wipe off with paper towel. Pros: quesadillas cook fast without worry, saves cutting time (also eliminates brain work on even cuts), simple concept, easy way to make quick quesadillas. It doesn't get used much in my house, because I like more filling in my quesadillas. But if you have kids or throwing a large party, it's a good way to whip up some fast bites."
3,Not a waste of money.,"Before buying this quesadilla maker, I was using a 12"" round grill pan to make my quesadillas -- which made flipping them over somewhat difficult. I do like this maker and recommend it to anyone who enjoys quesadillas. You do have to watch out if you have a tendency to overfill -- it will not seal properly and you will not get the ridges that help out when you cut and divide your quesadilla. Clean up is easy, all you'll need is a damp and dry paper towel."
2,Arrived broken,"The item was shipped timely and packaged nicely. It looks like there was no damage done during shipping, unless it occurred from being shaken. BUT....the maker arrived with the ""ready"" light broken off, and the device did not shut properly. I have not used it yet...I am afraid my quesadillas will be sideways..."
4,Works Great,This is my first Quesadilla maker I ever bought and it works great. I only wish it worked with smaller tortillas as well. I can't tell you how many times we've gotten the wrong size.
1,not versatile / hard to clean,"Well, the plates do not come off easily, so it's hard to clean.You can only make very thin quesadillas. Try to fit in anything other than a thin layer of cheese, and it squirts out everywhere.Oh, and you can only make quesadillas with it. Don't try to get creative and make anything else, because it's just too thin.If the unit had detachable plates, and the plates were deeper so that you could fit more goodies, it would be much better."
2,great for quesadillas with no filling otherwise make your own with a frying pan,"I picked up this item about a year ago and after the first 3 or four times of making quesadillas I had enough of this thing. The spacing for the filling is too small. If you put too much cheese it causes a mess and oozes out everywhere. I like to have something in my quessadillas other than cheese but this made it impossible to do so. My girlfriend showed me a better way with the frying pan that I could make it as good as this ""so-called"" quesadilla maker. Save your money cause this is nothing special. All it does is take up counter space and collect dust."
4,Anyone with teenagers needs this,"I purchased this for my teenagers for Christmas and they love it. I buy the larger tortilas, a bag of cheese some sour cream and meat and the kids do the rest. Resist the notion to pile on the fixings because the unit does not work properly if there is to much. The lid does not close completely and your quesadillia are not cooked evenly. Clean up must be easy because he kids can do it. I love this addition to our kitchen and we have not been to Taco Bell since I purchased this."
5,AS GOOD AS THE RESTAURANT,"I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday. He loves it.The quesadilla's are quick, easy, and fun to make.Make sure that you don't overload it with ingredients, as he did the first time...(a little overzealous, apparently.)Just follow recommended portions, and you can mix up the recipes with whatever ingredients you like.Pays for itself in 5 quesadilla pies."
1,A nightmare to clean,"I was so excited when I first got the quesadilla maker, but it was a different story after I used it... The cheese simply dripped all around the quesadilla maker, not only onto my countertop, which made a real mess, but mostly between the bottom heating plate and the plastic base of the appliance. It literally takes me half an hour to clean it up every time, and that's because I give up (you simply can't get the cheese out of this narrow space, since the heating plate doesn't come out). I tried it several times, placing aluminum foil between the countertop and the appliance to make cleaning easier, but there's nothing to be done about cleaning the quesadilla maker itself. So I finally gave up and made quesadillas with my good old pan, it was a breeze - to make them and to clean up! And the quesadillas are just as good. If I were you, I wouldn't get this product. It looks cool, but that's about it."
3,It depends upon your needs.....,"We love having quesadillas for a late night snack and thought this would be great. Unfortunately, it makes just as much clean-up work (or more) then cooking them on the stove. It is sturdy, but a little too much cheese and you're cleaning up drippings from the countertop as well as the sides. We have since opted to cook our quesadillas in the microwave for no mess or clean up. And the Santa Fe Quesadilla Maker? ..... well, its stowed away in the garage with the other great ideas that turned out not to be."
3,Why did I buy this?,"I love quesadillas and really wanted this product. There's really not much wrong with the product itself, other than the filling tends to ooze out the sides if you put too much in. The little lines browned into it make a nice slicing guide. And even filling that oozes out cleans up with a wipe of a paper towel - clean up is a breeze.But really, I feel a little bit foolish for getting this after I realized how easy it was to just make them in a non-stick frying pan. Actually I never even drag this quesadilla maker out of the cabinet anymore, a frying pan is way less bother. Of course in a frying pan you have to turn them over in the middle of cooking but that's the only advantage of this product. If you've got plenty of kitchen counter or storage space and nothing better to do with your money then this is a cute and harmless novelty but ultimately, it's completely unnecessary."
4,A Legal theory of Everything,"Just as physicists search for the unifying theory of particle physics and the universe, Professor Dworkin here presents a theory that unifies the sometimes conflicting aspirations of liberty and equality. As usual, his work is not only replete with insights but is frequently extremely profound - especially when he explains what should have been obvious to us but has somehow eluded our vision. Dworkin explains how liberty should not compromise equality without in turn compromising liberty itself. He gives us a new tool for evaluating the merits of changes in the law. As a lawyer and educator, I find this to be a very readable and noteworthy contribution to legal philosophy."
3,A mini chuck .......,"Quite a versatile tool.... I am uncertain if it is an anemic chuck or thaat I expect far too much in regard to capacity and durability.I regularly turn 4x4x4 pieces of hardwood and have noticed a tendency of the chuck to loosen while turning and after 6+months of steady use, the jaws are loose and wobbly. Great in a pinch, but probably will not repeat. The chuck opening/closing bars have long since snapped at the nipple interface and have had to be replaced."
2,Not a happy turner,"The chuck system pictured is not the one I received. I received the PSI bottom of the line chuck, with few options available and an odd-ball size. Got a fast refund, and ordered a PSI CSC2000C, which I like and is as pictured on line."
4,Love & Death in the Gulf,"Both a story of greed and obsession and a history lesson, Morir en el Golfo, leads us through the power struggles of a leader of the oil syndicate (Pemex) in Mexico in the late 70's, early 80's. Very well written and researched, it makes for a great read for those interested in Mexican politics during the era."
5,A must for every serious golfer!,"This book provides golfers at all levels of playing ability the opportunity to improve their game and also better understand ""how and why"" certain shots are made.It is simply the ""Bible"" of golf.Every golfer should own a copy and use it often."
5,enlightening,"you find out the reasons behind so muchthat seemed to be going down, to beworking against the individual."
4,great for beginers sorta preaching to the choir for others,this is just a begining to the atrocity of the WTO. it will give you great insight to its real workings kept secret by the corporate owned media. sorta old stuff for people who already know about the WTO
1,Maria Schriver's a much better writer,"From the US Constitution of (especially the commerce clause) to the German Zollverein to the EEC and EU, the history of the modern world has been one of economic integration and removal of obstacles to trade. As for this book, I'd rather spend my money on Ms. Arnold Schwartenegger's silly book than this even sillier drivel."
3,A good reference text,". . This text was presented to me as a gift. It is a solid reference to the many accomplishments offered humanity by the Italian race and its descendants. Obviously, the author has a good deal of research invested in this work, however, certain points are blurred by his writing style.Overall, this is a satisfactory read that serves as a good basis for more intense study of the Italian people. . ."
3,Good reference -- but too preachy for me,"If you need a reference to discuss Italian contributions to the world, this is a book filled with good content. However, I was turned off, as early as the introduction, by the tone. The author appears far too eager to prove how much we all rely on the ideas and inventions of Italians, rather than to simply detail the people and accomplishments. To me, the writing is not so much engaging as it is ""preachy."" I had alrady bought into the premise, before I bought the book, that Italians made, and still make, a multitude of contributions to the world."
4,An excellent debut! Go see them live.,"The self-titled album is an excellent debut for this band out of NYC. They play with the fluidity of a veteran jazz ensemble, but with the intensity of a young metal band. The music cannot be described. The album has a smooth flow and transitions betweens songs are good. I heard them live before I heard their cd and it does justice to their performances. The sounds that they put forth make you want to dance hard. I would recommend this album to fans of Jazz, Funk or Rock."
5,Amazing. Mind-blowing funk!!!,This album is truly incredible from start to finish. The only other band I can compare them to is MMW and that is unfair. These guys can funk it out with the best of 'em. I love this album as much and possibly more than anything by MMW. Not one song is bad or even just OK. The album is truly a masterpiece for a first album!! Can't wait to hear more.
1,Great Potential Wasted,"The premise of the book was unusual and full of potential. Unfortunately, the story was a meandering mess. The author appeared uncertain as to which plot line to pursue and the result is a boring story. There was not enough character development of the dwarves or the gnomes. Although the gnomes were supposed to be the ""bad guys"", the author failed to make them menacing and they came off as merely ""cartoonish"". Give this clunker a wide berth."
1,Not my favorite...,Sometimes I have to turn it off/unplug to reset the orb when it gets stuck and does not want to work.
5,Dilbert's First Large Book,"This is the first large Dilbert book in which we are given color Sunday strips in addition to the regular black-and-white regular strips. This book covers strips from May 19, 1991 to December 13, 1992. The Boss begins to take the form we are familar with (the pointy hair starts) and Wally comes into existance. Alice also begins to take form in this book. One of my favorite characters (and one whom Scott Adams has used rarely) is Zimbu the monkey and he shows up here as well. The strip continues to improve in the pages of this book. Great for light reading or a good laugh."
3,Standard Adams' fare,"If you like Scott Adams, you will like this book.But, unless you are a pack rat, is better to buy ""Dilbert 2.0, 20 Years of Dilbert"""
3,Dilbert's Improving with time...,"All of the characters have not yet appeared in their final forms, and I still don't find myself laughing out loud on every page, but there is usually a smile on my face as I read this book.Over time, the characters became far more fleshed out and more interesting. This is a bit of an inflection point, if you'll forgive the horrific reminders of Calculus. From here, the betterment of Dilbert really starts to pick up.If you are a completist, or you haven't ever read it, I would suggest picking it up. If you have seen it, you probably won't read it again and again, the way you might later collections. I leave it up to you.Harkius"
4,Too close to the truth for comfort,"The scary thing about Dilbert, I've just realized, is not so much that it resembles the company I work for so many times, but the fact that it must resemble more than just my company alone to account for its growing appeal. I guess in my heart of hearts I was hoping that if I ever moved to another company, I could leave the Dilbertisms behind--fat chance, it seems.Dilbert is well on its way to becoming a classic comic strip. Like the ones canonized before it, it has been able to take a segment of our society (Doonesbury) or life (Calvin and Hobbes) and relieve our tension. Adams is the one writer who can actually answer the question, ""Where do your ideas come from?"" because he often receives what becomes next week's strip from a reader email. As long as there are companies searching for answers in a changing marketplace, Adams will likely have material. Me, I'm just glad someone is enjoying the situation."
5,Fascinating disc of new music,"I am a music lover, but not a musician. I do try to be open to everything, but have always tended to avoid new music. Like others, I've always thought of contemporary music as ""wierd,"" or ""ugly."" But a friend recommended this CD to me, and I must say that I am amazed at what I heard. The music, by a composer named Andrew Simpson, is accessible and interesting...there are some really cool sounds and effects, such as in the first piece, called ""Summer-Night Songs."" The strange combination of saxophone and harp works very well, I think. Three pieces are for a solo instrument, of which the bass piece, ""Exhortation III,"" seemed the most ""out there."" But my favorite was the ""Chamber Concerto."" It is energetic, very driving and rhythmic, and even has a couple of memorable tunes. Restores my faith in modern music! Highly recommended."
5,Wonderful!,"My ferret LOVES this!! It is incredibly soft and big enough for him to stretch out in, and just the right size for him to be warm and comfortable in. Worth the price because your ferret will love you forever for it!!"
3,Chinchilla didn't like it,My chinchilla never uses it. He didn't like it when I had it up high and even when the floor of the tent is on the ground he won't sit in it. I use it as a place for his hay.
4,Great for Ferrets,"Because this tent does not have a sturdy bottom, it doesn't work well hanging and although they show it can be used like a hammock, my fuzzies do not like it that way. I place the tent on the cage shelf and connect the hooks to the shelf above it, just so they cannot move it away. I find them sleeping in this tent more than any of their other houses. It has gone through the wash several times and is still in good shape."
2,Furbabies will destroy in short order.,"My two ferrets completely destroyed this in only about three weeks, and they aren't usually very hard on their toys/bedding."
1,Very low quality,"There really isn't much I can say other than how disappointed both I and my adorable little sugar gliders are. The item started to fret at the edges within just a couple days of being placed into use, for many small animals this is exceedingly dangerous as they may get stuck and hang themselves on the strands or in an effort to get unstuck they may eat some of the material and to add insult to injury you get no option over the color of the item... the one we got was ugly as sin.Amazon was of course great in assisting as usual, however the replacement tore up just as fast as the original so we returned it as well and wrote this brand off as too low quality to purchase again."
2,mmmmmm,"this tent was a part of a set of items that you could purchase individually. the tent co;or was as shown. the tunnel was in the same print but green in color, and the hammock was blue. they are poorly constructed, with second rate materials right down to the zippers. i am much better off making my own products"
4,I have this for my Flying Squirrel,I have this for my squirrel for when he gets older and bigger for his larger cage to sleep in comfortably. He likes it so I'm happy.
4,Grimshaw rules!,"This video is great; especially with Grimshaw and Plymptoons. I didn't care for much about some of the other shorts,but it is funny! I would like to find more of these videos."
1,"Poor animation, vulgar, disturbing, and boring","I bought this by mistake, thinking it might be ""off the wall"" anime... but it was not even that good. The first piece in this compendium is so poorly animated, it makes South Park look like Disney. That would not be so bad if it had meaning or plot... but it doesn't! It's just a bunch of swirling vaginas. Oh boy. Yawn... There are a few MTV skits in here that you might recognize from Liquid Television, but, on the whole, most of the pieces are amateurish, lacking either good animation, good art, or meaning. This is the only DVD I ever returned for pure disappointment with the content and it was a testimonial to its universal lack of appeal that this came as no surprise to the store that sold it, who took it back without question, against their own policy of never taking back opened DVD's. That's just how bad it was..."
3,it was cool,"It was not as hard-core as I thought it would be. It was funny but I was expecting more when it was over. I was think ""is that it."" The animation was good but it is not for the passive movie watcher..."
5,"cartoons for fu%king adults, for sex and gore blood",never before have I laugh so hard or been shocked more than I was watching this inspired collection of animated shorts (some blend live action elements to delightfully sick effect).some of the segments are brilliantly conceived from a visual angle and some are so warped you feel guilty laughing at it.this is proof that their is an underground scene in America producing stuff that blows away every animated release by a major release studio. It should go mainstream like air on [adult swim]!
3,This plane does not take off.,"This review is by five year-old son Bilal: ""This airplane is really easy to break. We tried twisting the rubber bands with our hands, but it didn't work so well. There's a battery operated twister that might have worked better.Dad's take: ""I thought that the toy was made of wood but it was really may from plastic. Only one piece was wooden. This was OK except that the pieces were brittle and a couple of them broke when we tried to put it together. The plane itself doesn't fly very well. The first time we tried it noes-dived, breaking the central wood beam in half. The second time it flew but not very far. When we tried to twist the rubber bands for the third flight it broke. Overall it was not worth the money we paid."""
4,Liked it better than I thought I would.,"I read Girls of Riyhad, Inside the Kingdom and Kabul Beauty School. I liked all 3. All were in the same spirit. Interesting and fascinating. All 3 gave me a glimpse inside another culture - interesting. If you like learning about other possibly little known cultures check out Unorthadox by Deborah Feldman."
5,highly enjoyable,"This is the second book i've read by this author. She provides enough detail to take u the reader into the world of Kabul. It is well paced, good story line and well written. It highlights the plight of women in Afganistan pre and post Taliban rule. Highly recommended."
3,Decent story but consider buying used or getting from library,"This was a decent book, despite uninspiring prose. The author/protagonist does a good job taking us to the far away land of Afghanistan and relaying the plight of many Afghani women. She's inspiring as she throws herself into helping distressed people around the world; however, I was disappointed that I couldn't like the author/protagonist. By the end of the book, I found it troubling that she could travel thousands of miles to live and help others, while neglecting her own children. This dichotomy was all I could think of towards the end of the book and after finishing. Recognizing ""no one's perfect,"" I think she could have been more likeable and the book more satisfying if she would have addressed this dichotomy."
1,"Don't waste your time, money","This book is about an egocentric woman who claims to be aiding Afghan women but more often draws them into dangerous behaviors (considering their culture). Rodriguez seems appalled by the lives of these women and what they endure, then marries an Afghan man with wife and children, droning about her disappointment when he goes home to them. This book is pointless."
4,Great Read!!!,"This is a really interesting book. There are parts that jump around a bit but if you just press on, it all comes together. A very fascinating story. Afterwards I went on the internet to learn more about Kabul. When you read the book and you try to picture the scenery, the burkas, the beauty school, it is really interesting to see it some to life. This video isn't focused on the author, although you will see her here and there, it is focused on the huge effort behind the school.[...]"
4,A Fascinating Book,"In 2002, Deborah Rodriguez ventured off to Afghanistan with Care for All Foundation, an emergency and disaster relief organization. She knew nothing really about emergency and disaster relief--she is a hairdresser by trade. But she had a generous and brave spirit. When all the doctors and nurses had gone, she stayed behind to to build a beauty school and salon (something the Taliban had outlawed). She encountered the Taliban, women in arranged marriages, bombings, cultural divides--and all with great humor and grace. This was not only enlightening, but fun to read."
2,Mediocre and amateurish,"It is interesting to look at the life of Afghanistan's women through a beautician's point of view given the culture there, but the writing is unstructured and the author rambles endlessly many a time. I found my interest levels dropping drastically at times."
2,Overly Dramatized and Sterotypical,"In the book Kabul Beauty School, the author manipulates her personal relationships with these women and writes an overly dramatized and sterotypical story with many mistakes and factual errors on Afghan cultural. She also writes with a sense of superiority while ignoring the shortcomings in her own personal life."
3,okay,"This is a quick read, and it is interesting. However, I never really liked the author, and it seems irresponsible for her to divulge so many details about the lives of her students."
4,book of the month,My daughter recommended this book and I bought a used one through Amazon.com. The book arrived in excellent condition - didn't look used. It was a well written book and explained many things about the area and its people. Would highly recommend it for those who want to know what it's like living in Afghanistan and other mideast countries as I believe they all live by the same values.
5,A Personal Story of a Strange Land,I absolutely loved this book and reading about Debbie's adventure in Afghanistan. The book is very interesting as you learn about the culture of women in Kabul and how different it is from what we know. This captivating story is told as if you were hearing it from your best friend.
3,How reliable is this narrator?,"Memoirs, in my opinion, are often suspect for what they choose to tell and what they leave out. This one was no different than any others in that respect. Deborah is a very interesting person and her desire to help the women of Afghanistan is admirable. Like many Westerners though, her lack of understanding about the culture made her do some things that seemed unwise.The book is definitely worth reading, and especially as a book club selection as it will generate a lot of interesting discussion.What I enjoyed most in the book was hearing about all the different people from all over the world who came to help in Afghanistan after 9/11."
1,"Don't buy this book, go to your public library first.","After I read this book, I was ready to write a one star review. But all the other one and two star reviews have said what I was thinking. I would just like to add two other things. While it was ""brave"" of her to travel to Kabul, she was also reckless in endangering the lives of others with her frequent outbursts. Also, she thinks she saved so many women, but I'd like to know what did she do to the lives of the people who should have mattered the most to her, her kids (even though it was not really about them). I couldn't get past the fact that she sacrificed her children."
4,An Unusual Story,It was a fascinating story. It was hard to imagine that an American woman would get herself into such a situation. I was interested to know about the Afghan women and wonder what has happened since.
2,Something just didn't ring true...,"Opening a beauty school, in a foreign country, one we are at war with - there is just something missing from this story. You don't get State Dept. approval to fly in and out, as this main character did. On top of that, she isn't a likable character, and I will never understand a woman leaving her two children to go off on an adventure - one where she's putting her life at risk."
4,Interesting insight into a lot of things Afghanistan,Interesting. I admire the woman if not so much her writing. Her story is great and she touched a lot of lives. She was a GOOD ambassador from the US. We need more of those.
1,Cruel fool or a liar?,"I've read a lot of good reviews about this book here--positive, negative, and in-between. But for me, it boils down to this:In the first chapter, Rodriguez tells a story that, if it really happened, and if it happened to a friend whom she describes in such detail in the book that, if such friend exists, she would be easily identified and this chapter would surely lead to *terrible* problems for this friend. As an aside, it is told in such a way as to make Debbie sound like the Rational Save-The-Day American trying to help these poor, ignorant Afghans. Ick.So one of two things is going on here. Either:a) Rodriguez just spilled a very intimate secret that no one ever has any business knowing, and that will place her friend in terrible danger;orb) She made it up, in which case this book is a work of fiction, *not* a the true-story memoir that it claims to be.So which is it Deborah Rodriguez? Are you a cruel fool, or a liar? Either way, pretty despicable."
2,"Interesting story line, awful writing","Most of the reviews I have read summed up my own opinion as well. The story has huge potential, but the style is awkward and egotistical. The author is a little too proud of herself, a terrible Mom (where were your own two sons when you were off saving Afghanistan?), and a worse writer. This book DID make me realize how very grateful I am to not live in Afghanistan (as well as how grateful I am to not have her as a mother)."
1,"Condescending, self-serving, culturally-insensitive, irresponsible","I found the author and the women who'""helped' the women of Kabul in attendance at the ""Beauty School,"" to be condescending American yuppies. The author and her 'group' of beauticians, disgusted me with their reluctance to really try to respect and understand the women's plight there. Of course they felt sad hearing their stories, shed a tear or two, but in the end, didn't really help them. They epitomized how the Ugly American must be view in many 3rd world countries. Their curiosity satisfied, and the pats on the back from ingratiated, sobbing women of Kabul, they returned home to their safe lives...only to have exposed the women in the book/documentary to public humility...some were severely ostracized and even in danger. As an American Muslim, I was embarrassed for the author and her group, and extremely sad for the women of Kabul."
4,A window to another world for women.,"I just picked this book up and couldn't put it down for several days. I look at it from a point of women studies. It is interesting to learn about the way women are in a country formerly ruled by the Taliban. It is a very interesting look into their lives and provides great contrast to an American womans.The more I read about the authors personal life in the book, the more I had a hard time continuing to read the book. I don't know what kind of mother leaves her children willingly to go to another country for several time periods without them. I don't know what kind of mother marries someone she hardly knows as more of a lark than anything and doesn't consult her children. As a mother, I find the author remarkably selfish in her decisions."
5,The Kabul Beauty school,Enjoyed the discription of the country and local customs.Gets you envolved in the relationships between the characters.Outlines the dificulties that between coltures.
3,A good little read,"As with most first-time narratives, the author has some trouble stepping back from her emotions in the topic. The idea of a beauty school in Kabul seems outrageous, but upon her first arrival there we are reminded again that basic care items, like showers, haircuts, etc. are a welcome touch of ""civility"" wherever one goes.How she got her husband, etc. and other details could be fleshed out better and more detail would be appreciated, but as a mass-market book on a different topic, I enjoyed her tale and appreciated the inside glimpse to something that most people would never think of."
2,Mediocre Book,"I had a difficult time reading this book. It didn't engage me the way many other books about Afghani culture has.A Short Walk In The Hindu KushDanizers TravelsAn Unexpected LightThe Swallows of KabulThe Book Seller of KabulThree Cups of TeaWomen on the Bridge of Fireto name a few, but this hairdresser left me yawning. Do you really think this is a good book to recommend for book clubs???"
3,"Interesting book, but credible?","I recently finished this book and found it interesting, despite the fact that it is not particularly well written. Some of the stories, like Debbie helping a young woman fake her virginity, don't pass the ""sniff"" test--it just doesn't smell true that women in Afghanistan wouldn't know how to fake virginity when the cost of not being a virgin at marriage was so high. Also, I can't imagine why anyone would enter into a arranged marriage with someone they met less than two weeks earlier, especially when her first impression of the groom was of him passed out on the floor and they don't have a common language. This is even more strange given her marital history and the stories of abusive Afghan husbands she's heard. I haven't heard the NPR story, so can't comment on that controversy. I am confused, however, about the talk of the photos of the women. The book I read from my local library only had a photo on the cover."
1,Do not buy this book.,"This book starts off with what could have been a fascinating chapter about getting ready for a wedding, but then reveals a secret that the bride confides to the author. The bride seems to have considered the author to be a friend. Even if all the names and places have been changed (and it doesn't say changes were made), it is an astounding betrayal. There is no excuse. I really regret having paid money for this."
2,I didn't like this book,"I thought this book was rather dry, and I couldn't put myself into it. It seemed to be more about the author than the interesting situation she found herself in. I couldn't finish it. For anyone interested in a book on this subject I reccomend the Kite Runner or A Thousand Splendid Suns, you would enjoy it much, much more."
3,DISAPPOINTING,"Because the description of a culture so vastly different from ours was interesting, I gave the book three stars. Sadly, however, the writing was mediocre and even boring at times, detracting from the focus of the book."
4,Kabul Beauty School,I am enjoying this book regarding the women of Kabul. I am having a hard time with the author who does the narration. At times I admire her and other times she irritates me to no end. Her quick marriage to her Afhgan husband was beyond comprehension to me. I also could not understand her leaving her children for long periods of time. Although she was a quick learner and I give her credit for the undertaking she took I did not feel that she was culturally ready for dealing with the women in Kabul.
5,Kabul,FASCINATING INSIDE PICTURE OF EVERYDAY LIFE IN A PLACE THAT IS AN ENIGMA TO MOST AMERICANS. VERY ENTERTAINING BESIDES.
1,Framing nailer,"Received in what appeared to be like new condition. When attempting to use it, thegun would not create enough pressure to completely sink the nail. Always left a 1/4inch head, which needed to be finished off with a hammer. My compressor delivered 120#of force. Had to return it to seller.Disappointed, R. Rush"
4,"Great Product, a Little Short of Expectations","This is a first rate nailer, and saving a few bucks bas a bonus. However, it wasn't made clear to me that the air adapter needed to connect the nailer to the air hose was not part of the purchase. I was all set to nail tegether a deck on Sunday morning, and was flummoxed by the lack of the part. I have purchased other nailers, and they have all come with this part, so...did I get short changed? Amazon, if you are listening, please let me know if I should be looking at the mail to see one coming soon. There was no local retailer open, so had to canabaliz another nailer to do the work, and switch back and forth."
4,Works for me,This is a reconditioned tool but it couldn't look any better if it were new. It works to my expectation. My only issue is that so far I have only been able to find nails online but with free one day delivery it is hard to complain.
1,Dead on Arrival,I was anxiously awaiting receipt of this nailer. It came very quickly but when I first tried to use it didn't work. I had to take to the DeWalt Service Center in town for repair.I have yet to get it back from the repair.
4,Raco is not quite what it once was.,"Raco used to be the go-to box for most electricians but they're not quite as good now. The box is now mostly aluminum which isn't a problem but the 3 plugs that are included are plastic and that's what gets this 4 stars. If you're installing this where it's to be exposed to the sun then the plugs are not as long lasting as aluminum and there was a time when you got enough plugs for all holes but one... so if you're only using one hole, such as an outlet box on the end of an extension cord, you're short a plug with this box. I purchased this for about five bucks and see it's now over eight and it's not worth that price. If you see it around the price I paid I'd highly recommend it and suspect most users would be giving it 5 stars."
3,Semi-agree with other reviewers,"It was a good read, not a great one. Basically the heroine's dad lies to her and sends her to the Hero, thinking the hero wants to marry her. The Hero wants the heroine's sister because she's more beautiful. The hero was a jerk to the heroine pretty much up until the last few chapters when he realizes he doesn't want the vain sister, he wants the heroine. The heroine has been in love with him throughout the book, even when he was a jerk of the highest order to her. The vain sister shows up, gets hurt, and goes off with a secondary character in the book, leaving the playing field wide open for the hero and heroine. I'm pretty sure I've read this story somewhere else, but it was written well. Just not a re-read for me."
5,Compelling read!,"Again, Ms MacLean has created a rich setting for her intriguing characters. Tricked by her father, Madeline arrives in Nova Scotia expecting to marry. But the handsome Adam has also been tricked by her father. He was expecting Madeline's sister. Smarting from Adam's shock, Madeline tries to turn her life around. But thanks to Ms MacLean's deft hand and delicious storytelling, Adam and Madeline find at first a common ground, mutual respect and companionship and the reader holds her breath as we see this very compelling romance begin to bud. But Alas, Ms Maclean twists the story delightfully! Don't worry, I won't spoil it for you!Realistic, vivid and fabulous, this story is well worth the great reviews it has received. I highly recommend Adam's Promise!"
3,Did I read the same book the other reviewers did?,"The other reviews discuss the plot, so I'll not do that. Just state my feelings after reading this story. All the other Amazon.com reviews here were so superlative (and convinced me to buy this), but honestly I didn't think this story was as great as the others said. It's a solid 3-star effort for the writing, but the substituted bride element is not, as romance-novel-creativity goes, a particularly memorable one. It's been done before. The book didn't make me experience a ""richly emotional"" payoff, as the professional review would put it. I thought Adam was behaving like a jerk toward Madeline, and this behavior toward her goes on for a length of time, until he starts being physically attracted to her. A pleasant-enough romantic read by the end, but unfortunately not a keeper for me."
2,Fantastic or not - $240 for 10 cds???,"This may very well be a fantastic set, but how on earth can anyone justify charging $240 for a 10 cd set? That's $24 per cd. Holy smokes.. I have the Brilliant Classics Tallis Complete Works - 10 cds, and it's listed at only $29.99 as I type this. I'm not a classical music guru or professional critic by any stretch, but I'm perfectly happy with the Brilliant Classics set and have a real hard time believing that this particular set is so superior to justify spending over TEN TIMES as much on it.If you can find it elsewhere for half, then that changes things a bit (at least that puts it into a reasonable per-cd price, but still, it's hard to ignore the difference in price tags.Can you say ""overpriced""?Gotta give 2-stars based strictly on value when there is another comparable set out there for a fraction of the cost."
3,framework,this book met expectations and is a quick reference and review. illustrations could be better
5,A must read for any health conscious person,"The book thoroughly covers nutrition and exercise in a very comprehensible language.Importantly, ""FrameWork"" explains how to DO NO HARM to your body while improving every part of the system.The book will be useful for anybody, regardless of age, sex, and physical activity.After reading ""FrameWork"", I continue using it as a reference book."
3,I passed this one to my sons.,"If I had a dollor for every weightloss, get-strong book I've purchased over my 61 years I could retire to Paris. Alas, I'm still chubby but I know a lot. This book contains good information. Many of the recommended exercises are performed on gym equipment. If I'd read Framework at age 28 when I started running my knees might work today. Consequently, I passed this book to my sons, both runners with gym memberships, in a hope that it helps them minimize joint damage."
4,"Most unusual, like no oher!","Bird Yard has a plot like no other. A well written and unusual crime novel, it involves the murder of young boys by a crazed birdlover. Julia Wallis Martin gives much info on the psychology of the killer's mind and the network between pedophiles. How childhood incidents involve your sexual preferences, you'll soon find out.If you have an interest in the slightly bizarre, this one is for you!"
2,Poor sound quality - for talk only,"You get what you pay for.I like this style of headphones. They're comfortable; slightly in-ear for better sound and bass. But in this case, the design doesn't help the sound. The frequency response is advertised as 10-25,000 Hz with super bass. Don't believe it.If you're looking for headphones to monitor AM talk radio or audio books these will work, but the sound quality is too limited for any kind of music (unless you enjoy listening to your tunes over the telephone)."
2,"If you like corny romances, you'll love this","An avid reader of christian fiction, this book didn't strike me at all. Although I've read previous books of Robin Jones Gunn and found them highly entertaining I found ""An Unlikely Prince"" to be, well--just sappy. The ""hero"" is a staunch, tight professor who moves in next door to a woman who is starting a daycare center. He dislikes kids/she loves them and thus the attraction begins. I just didn't find the characters to be very developed and thought it was very slow and uninteresting."

5,Surgical Cone Shaped Face Mask Bx/50 Blue,I wear masks for allergies a lot of the time. These masks are heavier and best of all unscented. I liked mine and shared with a friend that says the same. Others I have received are heavily perfumed and I was delighted to see these weren't
3,"Good mat, but not very durable for heavy use","I have been using the Earth Elements 3mm mat for about 2 years in vinyasa and anusara classes. It has a dense cushion, but is lightweight, and won't slip around on a hardwood floor during vinyasa. I like the 3mm thickness, but I do have to double it over to do headstand.It has been a good mat, but it's not as durable as I would have hoped. It has not laid flat on the floor for about a year. Instead it has ripples along it's long edges, I guess due to constant stretching during downward dog and other poses. When I first unroll it, it will roll back up on me unless I fold under the top edge and weigh it down with my towel.I am getting joked about my mat in yoga class, because it looks so pitiful. Guess that's when you know it's time for a different mat.I'd recommend this mat to someone looking for a lightweight, eco-concious mat, who will not be doing a vigorous practice. It was a bit slippery in the beginning, but broke in very quickly."
5,Great product!,"I just got my mat in today and it came so quickly! I am happy to notice that the odor was not very strong like other mats. I used it right away and felt that the cushion was sufficient. The color is also very nice. As a plus, I do like that the product is biodegradable and therefore a little better for the environment when I am done wtih it. Highly recommended!"
3,Slippery,"It's a nice mat, will give you plety of support because of its thickness but I've been using my mat for over 2 weeks now doing yoga and pilates almost everyday but it's still slippery. I still have to use my yoga paws to hold my poses."
2,Poor traction,"I like the eco aspect of this mat, but the performance was pretty bad.Have had it a year and prob go to 2 to 3 yoga classes per month. So call it a maximum of 36 classes and it has almost no traction left. Either my hands are sliding all over it or I flip the mat, and then the mat itself is sliding all over the floor.I don't wash the mat (other than an occasional water rinse) or leave it out in the sun, so can't imagine what would be to blame.I wouldn't recommend it or buy another."
3,China Made,"I ordered this sweater in a size medium which is the correct size for my Pappilon. It was to small. It cost me $3.83 to send it back and get a size large. I suggest that anything made in China should not be purchased over the internet, better yet, should not be purchased at all."
1,Liberty Hose Cart,"Total piece of junk. Poorly built, wheels would not stay on, cheap thin guage metal. Returned it."
5,Works well with older jig saws.,"It's not easy to find a jig saw blade with the ""U"" shaped top and screw hole. My older Craftsman jig saw is built for this. The blade gives a nice smooth cut and seems to have an impressive useful life. Make sure to use the right blade for the job at hand. Very pleased with this product."
4,The Pine State,"Some very interesting events in Maine's history are scattered through out this book. It is as another reviewer put it; a series of essays. The pictures tell a story of days gone by and help keep your interest. Maine is a beautiful state, full of small towns and friendly people."
4,Fun!,"My granddaughter was thrilled with this toy. She loves to dance to it. It isn't super clear and doesn't do a whole lot, but any fan of the show will love it."
4,Surprisingly wonderful for gamers,"This device, though intended for notebook number crunchers, is worth it's weight in gold to gamers. It's surprisingly liberating to move away from the WASD control scheme and use this nifty little device instead. Other brand devices require a driver (and may be better suited to notebook use) but this ugly little gray box plugs straight in and just works - perfect for gaming. It's also much sturdier than many competitors and has full-size, full-range keys (not notebook style flat keys)."
1,Stay away!!!,"Were do I start???Frist,we couldn't get it to work on our Dell notebook.Second,called (Genovation)twice by phone and they didn't call back.Third,I e-mailed them THREE times.Didn't hear from them.So Amazon (they were GREAT!) took it back for full credit and shipping cost.Here's the kicker.About four weeks after I got another one (different Co.) I get a call wanting to know what the problem was.I told them and the person said they were really busy.Told them got another product and he said ,""Oh Well""."
3,Too long for a 4 year old,"We got this from his grandma and I was excited because it was the same illustrator as Miss Fiona's Stupendous Pumpkin Pies - the pictures are fun in this book too, but the story is just too long. I've tried to sit down and read it to him several times, but it's just too advanced (and long) for him - and I consider him very advanced in the types of books he likes to read, but this one absolutely bores him. Hopefully someday we'll be able to finish it, because I'd like to know what happens too! (it is a bit long and drawn out with big words and even I get a little tired of all the verbage)."
1,Twisted Sistahs,"I have not received Twisted Sistahs yet. I wanted it for October so I ordered it September 18, 2005 with two other books. I sent a check for the amount for three books and have only received two. Please send it to me A.S.A.P. if it is no longer on back order!Thank you,Marian Muise"
5,Another gem from this wonderful author!,"Wonderful rhymes and storyline! My 4 year old loves this book! It is rather lengthy, which is wonderful, because we read some the first night, more the next night and finish up the third night! She can't wait for storytime each night so we can pick up where we left off and find out what happens next with the three sistahs! Beautifully illustrated and wonderful storylines. Magnificent!"
4,Sanji and the Baker,"This story is very interesting. It is about a man, named Sanji who travels all around the world. He ends up in Fratsia and decides to stay for a while. He buys a house and lives above a bakery. But he doesnt know what he is getting into........ The story then takes a big twist at the end, that is quite ironic. I enjoyed this book very much. My favorite characters were Sanji, because he was a good honest man, and also the baker because he can be very sneaky and he is also very funny. I think you should take the time to sit down and read this book becuase of the big twist. I think you would enjoy this book, hopefully, just as much as i did.Lynsi"
1,I didn't receive this book!,It has been more than a month now but I still haven't received my book! It is very frustrating that there is no way to contact Amazon on this matter!
5,Easy-to-read information on Development,"As a parent educator, I often recommend titles I think will be of particular use to parents. This is one I also give to friends and family members as a baby gift. It's a book that can be referred to quickly and easily to find out say, why your 3 month old is fed and dry and still crying; why your toddler is so insistent on having everything done the same way, all the time; what to do when your three year old has a blazing meltdown in the grocery store; or how to determine if your five year old is ready for kindergarten.If it's a developmental issue, you'll find it in this book and what's more, you'll understand it a little better and be better able to decide what to do about it, if anything. It's always a happy thing when you find out that your child is not disturbed---but simply age four. This is a helpful and reassuring book."
5,"a down to earth book to help parents, parent..","IS THIS A PHASE, is a practical approach to some of the inevitable challenges of parenting. Ms. Neville does an excellent job of selecting topics, ordering them in an easy to access manner and describing various ways to understand and, hopefully, manage many of the challenges we parents face. The language is right to the point--an important factor when we're trying hard to cope and have only a limited amount of time and resources to find help. The drawings and presentation are entertaining and add some needed lightness to the tasks of parenting. I highly recommend this book for parents interested in better understanding why their child is the way s/he is and techniques they can try to manage different developmental stages."
1,The Shepherd of the Hills Not,"The only one of this collection I have seen is The Shepherd of the Hills. Although it is no fault of Mr. John Wayne's, it should have been rightly givin the title above. I have the novel and have read it numerous times. This movie is so far removed from that story that it doesn't even deserve to wear the same title. How Hollywood thought they could improve on such a deeply moving story by totally butchering it and changing the characters and the plot is beyond me. I wanted to be able to review that movie alone, but the only way I could was by choosing this collection, since I could not find the movie for sale independently. But then, considering the nature of it, I can understand why. Anyone who has read Harold Bell Wright's novel would probably never purchase the EXTREMELY loosely based interpretation alone."
4,John Wayne-An American Icon Collection,This is my idea of history although some the performances were less than top drawer. The price was right and the delivery was prompt.Being a AF veteran of the Korean War helped me understand the F86 era fighter the movie Jet Pilot offered.
3,Useful information; unpoetic title,"This book contains useful information for multicultural families, and is recommended notwithstanding the clunky title."
5,A Great Way To Start The Day!,"What a great pick me up book! It causes you to reflect on the stuff of life, not material things, but the things that really matter, like your friends, your family, your faith, and your ability to focus and have fun.You can put this book down...but you will be compelled to pick it up again and again...time after time after time. It's that good.If you want to feel good all over, read this book.Bill Goss, author, THE LUCKIEST UNLUCKY MAN ALIVE"
3,"o.k. for price,not great. BIC f12 is much better.","i have both this and the f12 which is a few dollars more. f12 is actually way better. this sounds the way i would expect a $150 sub would sound. i bought this off of reviews and the fact i liked the f12 so much but after getting it i was actually not happy at all. i get the whole burn in time for subs, but this sub is barely a 3 star sub and it gets that due to its cheap price. i will be selling mine shortly and using the money to buy another f12. the f 12 is truly comparable to several $500-$1000 subs I have heard and i think that is why my expectations for this one was so high. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY THE BIC F12. i dont see a huge diff between f12 and hsu. the only good thing i can say about this sub is the build quality is pretty good but that is with any BIC product."
3,Ugly and weak sound,"If you are concerned at all about looks, this is not the sub for you. It looks cheap and the silver-gray color is ugly. Definitely doesn't pass the wife approval rating. As far as sound goes, the sound was ok, but the output was relatively weak. I ended up returning this and getting the Polk PSW10 for less money and love that sub. It looks great, sounds better, and is louder than this one."
5,Bic V1020 Subwoofer,"I'm not an audiophile but this sub-woofer sounds great. Easy setup good cross-over range. I've placed it in the corner of a 12' X 15' den and the base is solid. Looks and sounds like a winner to me.BIC V1020 10"" Down-Firing Powered Subwoofer"
5,Great sub!,"I have never been able to afford a gigantic sub. I have had a few subs at 100 watts. This sub rocks my house. I am extremely impressed. I shudder to think what it would be like if I got the v 1220 instead. This sub is located in an upstairs extra room that is about 12 by 40 and I had to turn the bass down. I am a guy who maxed out the sub on every surround system I ever had, and I am constantly tweeking. I cannot recommend this sub more for the price. I always wanted to buy a high end subwoofer, but I won't now as long as this one lasts. If I would have bought anything with more power than this, my wife would not have been happy."
3,Adequate,"I bought this subwoofer because of the low price and good reviews. Well, it was a slight disappointment for me. While it's true you probably can't get a better subwoofer for the money, it didn't meet my expectations. A good sub will have a tight firm thump. This one has a loose bad sounding thump. Almost like it is bottoming out, even when the music is not loud. Also, this sub barely can provide enough bass for my 2.1 stereo setup using Klipsch Reference RF-52 speakers (which aren't that big). If I want a 5.1 or 7.1 setup I am going to have to get a much more powerful sub.I do NOT recommend this sub UNLESS you are looking to save a few bucks and only plan on having a 2.1 setup. Otherwise try a higher wattage Klipsch. It will sound much better for your surround sound system while watching movies."
1,The product carried by Amazon is grey market,"The item I received from Amazon was an authentic Michael Kors fragrance. However, the serial number was etched off the bottom of the bottle. The fragrance inside was also very degraded and old. It didn't smell anything like the sample I have. This product was either exposed to heat or light in storage. The other fragrances in my package were fine."
4,Found it,the store where I normally get this has stopped selling it. I search around my towna nd could not find it so I was happy when I found it on line
4,"Very Good Quality Wig, Great for Costume","We purchased a used Stephanie costume for Halloween and the wig was pretty fried, so I bought this and it was great, not just because the wig had a better color, but because she got to wear the bracelets and purse that had the lazytown songs. My daughter loves to groove to the cheesy songs!!"
5,Stephanie Costume,"My sister enjoyed being Stephanie from Lazytown, for Halloween.She loved all the stuff that came with the wig, too. This is a great costume for anyone."
1,Disappointed,Nothing really new here... some nice photos but not much fresh information. Lots of rehashing of what I've seen in many other places.
1,This is item is junk,"This item is poorly made. The directions are so poorly translated and spelled that they are laughable. The 2 thin/cheap strips of velcro intended to keep the collar closed pop open as soon as you get enough traction to feel it at all. The release valve does not work. I had to pull the bulb off the end of the hose to deflate the device to put it back in the box. I returned it the day after I received. The ""expedited"" shipping took almost a week."
2,Uncomfortable and fragile,"I found it to be uncomfortable and not very durable: after a few weeks of use, the sack ruptured."
1,Save Your Money!,Very poorly made. Air bulb leaks. Neck traction pillows leak. Someone is making a great profit! Save your money and time.
4,Great help for the price,"The Deluxe Neck 3 Layers Self Adjusting Cervical Traction does just what it says. It is easy to use, delivers relief to the neck, and is easily stored. I have had great success in using it. The directions are easy to understand and you can use it anywhere. I was able to take it with me on a recent trip. I would recommend this product to anyone."
4,Nice little cooler,"This is a nice little wine cooler; I wanted it for the purposed of regulating the temperature of my 'finer' wines, and it has done so beautifully. My only concern is that the lock is rather flimsy, holding closed only the bottom part of the door. It won't keep a burglar out, but it is enough to give the message that the wines are off-limits."
1,Buyer Beware,"My unit worked OK for 2 years, then died. Like with other posters, Avanti wouldn't even help me with the name of an authorised service provider in my (or any other) area. When I finally located one, the experience only got worse and much more expensive. Just make sure you add several hundred dollars and much aggravation to the Avanti purchase price as you compare with other products."
1,Refrig. died after a year,"Quick shipping and good service from this vendor, but the product didn't last. Just after the warranty expired, so did my wine refrig. It completely met my expectations until then - it was efficient and quiet, but just didn't last."
2,"noisy, poor build quality","We bought this unit because of some reviews that said it was quiet, but ours makes a fairly annoying buzzing sound. I just peeked inside and realized that two of the screws that hold the fan in place are the wrong size, they can just be pulled out with your fingers! Obviously Avanti does not have good quality control. From the other reviews it seems like some people get a good quiet product, but some people don't...."
4,Tungsten jig saw bits,"Good product for cutting glass, ceramics and such. At least the last one was great, yet to use this one."
5,Gripping,Good story line. Held my interest. Couldn't wait to find out what happened next. Incredibly timely subject. The author is clairvoyant--how could he have known when he wrote this book what would happen to Bill Clinton? A MUST read! a FUN read!
3,Interesting plot idea not fully realized,"The idea that a gifted American politician is actually an unwitting tool of an international communist conspiracy that hopes to put him into the White House is certainly intriguing. It would make an interesting book. This isn't quite it, though. The author spends considerable time detailing the machinations behind all this, but I find the characters totally without dimension or interest on their own and serving merely to advance the plot. The question quickly becomes, how will it all turn out. Once you understand what the plot is, the best thing is to turn to the last chapter to see how the author resolves it."
1,"Another LeCarre? That's a joke, right?","Based on a variety of reviews comparing Charles McCarry to John LeCarre, I have gotten from 1/3 to 1/2 of the way through three of McCarry's most popular novels before giving up. What a waste of time. Language, simply for some kind of effect, you wouldn't come across in a skid-row bar on Saturday afternoon. Plots so trite and common they have no credibility right from the start.Please, you people who are making the comparisons, read ""Spy Who Came in from the Cold""; then read ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy"", and then finish the trifecta off with the best of them all ""Smiley's People"". THEN, tell me this guy is another John LeCarre!"
2,Very Simplistic,I found this book to be simple to read. The plot was faily easy to follow with no hidden twists or turns. You knew how the book was going to end very early in the story. Easy reading if you don't want to be tied down for a long time. You can pick this one up or put it down time after time with no problem. Like a soap opera.
2,Primary Colors with a more vindictive approach.,"I enjoyed Shelley's Heart, and looked forward to reading McCarry's latest. However, this transparent attack on Clinton quickly grows boring. There are some nuggets of a solid thriller, but these are buried by McCarry's personal agenda."
5,Wonderful book from a wonderful exhibit,The Potter's Eye was an exhibit at the N.C. Museum of Art. This companion book manages to capture the exhibit. Mark Hewitt's and Nancy Sweezy's words illustrate the pots almost as well as the photos. This is a book I return to time and again for inspiration.
5,An all-too-real glimpse of the foibles of human nature,"Getting Back is a fast-paced, wry and deftly written story by Mark Maller that examines the question of free will within the context of an original and entertaining novel. Focusing on the life of a seemingly ordinary man, first as a student struggling against a domineering biology professor, and later in life as a destitute, bitter married man seeking revenge on the wife he suspects of adultery, Getting Back questions whether the actions in one's past permanently etch the chart of one's future, and offers an all-too-real glimpse of the foibles of human nature."
3,A compliation that is worth getting if you like their early year stuff,"This compilation CD contains songsfrom: Cheap Trick ('76'77), InColour and Heaven Tonight. Why it'spackaged under the heading of 1979is anybody's guess, although theycertainly did 'break out' duringthat year. Good old tunes, but afterPete Comita and later (especially)Jon Brant joined, they really tookover! Best of the 'Tricksters',?1) Next Position Please ['83],2) Standing on the Edge ['85],3) The Doctor ['86],4) One on One ['82],5) Up The Creek ['84]6) Mighty Wings ['86]7) Rock and Rule [formerly known as 'Drats', ['81,'83,'85]and the Live LPs through the years: At Budokan, Budokan II,Music for Hangovers, Cheap Trick Live in Germany, ChepaTrick Live in Australia and From Tokyo to You. The rareGermany concert, which started the N.P.P. Tour was a bootleghere in the US and is only in rare cases on VHS. Too bad!"
5,Inside Power,"Inside Power is a wonderful book. Gary Sheffield shares his true feelings and his very real struggles, only to be redeemed through his surrender and acceptance of Jesus. This is a wonderful account of a young man who had worldly riches, but realizes that he was still empty and lost without the love of Jesus Christ in his life. This is a book for all to read, especially our teenage boys and young adult men."
5,JoeyV,This Book is a great read. Having been born and raised in Tampa I am very familar with what Gary is talking about. I highly recommend this book to any baseball or sports fan who has been through similar situations.Congrates Gary !
1,is this the rockabilly artist from OC??? who sounds like,"Elvis, is thats russell scott's red hots???"
4,HD radio works!,"I bought the JVC-HDR1 to replace the factory unit in a Toyota Highlander. The improvement in FM reception is very noticeable. I listen to KCSM-FM which is an all-jazz community college station broadcasting from about 30 miles away. Without HD, static ""happens"". With HD the sound is clean, no static! Most of the stations I listen to offer HD. Sound quality using CDs is also good. The only things I miss about the factory unit are the larger faceplate and buttons and cleaner overall look. Installation of the JVC was not hard, basically the same as any other typical replacement head unit. It uses the existing vehicle antenna."
4,Decent product if you are close to the FM transmitter,"Basically I like the product. However, if you are in the FM fringe area (i.e. 30 miles away from the FM transmitter), the automatic switching between analog and HD can become annoying. If you switch to HD-2, the music stops when the signal is too low and resumes when the signal comes back in stronger. I have ordered an antenna amplifier and will see if this problem goes away."
4,Good Radio for the price,This radios wma/mp3 feature is really nice. I put a mixer of albums in both formats on a disk and it plays all of them equally well. The HD very cool. I just wish there where more the 4 stations that broadcast in HD.
1,jvc has the worst customer service,I sent in a car radio that needed a inner face plate after 2 months of use. They sent it back scratched up & broke the usb port. & basicaly said to bad. We didn't do it. Do not buy jvc
4,Best deal for a radio with built in HD,"Great sound with HD. When the HD tuners alone are going for over $400.00, this stereo is bargain. You will need the manual by your side to set the clock, and fine tune the EQ. May need a good set of speakers and an external amp to get the best out of this."
4,Fantastic,"We bought this to put in an older truck. My father loves it. He's impressed with the quality of the sound. Having a little trouble getting the ""in between"" stations but finding plenty to give him variety in his listening pleasure.Recommend this to any one interested in quality sound."
5,"Easy to use, GREAT!","This is the most affordable built-in HD radio on the market. Very easy to install into your car, and very easy to use once installed. HD works flawlessly, and HD-2 channel support is great! The sound on this thing is amazing, you get preset and custom EQ settings. MP3/WMA cd playback is a huge plus. All cd/radio text is displayed, so you always know what the name of the song/artist you are listening too.Since I have bought this radio, I look for excuses to drive, just so I can get in my car and listen to this radio. 5 stars, excellent radio."
4,JVC HD RADIO,"I Installed this radio in my Motorhome, Works Great, Sounds Great, Easy to see, Easy to operate...."
5,Nice HD deck,"I pruchased this deck to replace a worn out cd player in my car. I really enjoy the clarity of the HD radio, but I do live around a city where I here HD signals are more readily available. I have not taken it into rural areas where I hear that signals can be hard to acquire. The cd clarity is as good as I need it, but I am not a really a good judge of quality sound. I just want a player that is clear and easy to use. I also like the optional ipod adapter which makes playinghte ipod in the car easy, and allows me to keep the ipod in the glove away from prying eyes. The only feature that I have not found useful yet is the remote. In my car the radio is not so far away as to necessitate a remote."
5,Great Radio,"Standard installation, standard radio controls, figured it out before I had a chance to read the owner's manual.It'a amazing to hear the difference HD makes. With this radio you tune in your station, initially it picks it up in Standard Definition (SD), if it has High Definition (HD) content a little HD icon pops up. It then switches to HD. If the station has alternate programming pressing ""Up"" on the selector knob will go to the next channel that the station broadcasts, HD-1, HD-2, and so on. HD stations also broadcast their call letters so the radio will display the station as ""KWMU - 90.7"".This really a revolution in radio, I'm late to join the revolution, but I'm sold on the technology.Also, the CD player works great.Please review your local stations and wikipedia before buying to see if the technology is right for your needs and location."
1,Its ?????,"I found this book to only be okay and boring it needs zaz not blaa..That is what it is blaa. I would pass it on or give it to a in-law then to keep it.It has good reciepes but no more then the other ones and it is a basic book. I think ,if this is to have a bang it needs more then what it has.."
4,great tips,ive tried two of the recipes in this book and they took alittle adjusting to get them up to par but this book offers great tips and a great base line to start doing great things with your smoker
1,It is O.K,"I was excited about a new book to the already many cookbooks. When I got home and started reading Alot of what is writen is not correct at all. I do agree some of what is offered can be used, but not enough to make think ""Boy am I glad I got this book"" Peace,love and BBQ Is far better just for one example"
2,Not really barbecue!,"I must agree with a lot of the other folks on this one. Boiling is NOT barbecue! Another thing; how can anyone that smokes food ever tell me that cherry wood is not satisfactory???? Cherry is one of the best flavors to add to other hardwoods for a special flavor that can't be beat. I probably wouldn't use it by itself, but for someone to tell me not to use it at all is just plain wrong.There are a ton of Q books out there; unfortunately, there isn't one that will satisfy everyone. You takes your chances with everything, I guess. Paul Kirk's books have always been pretty solid."
3,Not enough bang for your buck,I got this as a gift for a child who likes to play pretend school.The shipping was very expensive for such a light weight item. It really is just cardboard on sticks. You can make it yourself. I give it a couple of stars because it's a good idea. There's not that many pretend school stuff out there. I was a little embarassed giving it as a gift. It didn't look like what it cost.
2,Beware Class Signs,"This is a great concept for any classroom, however it is a very flimsy product. The least they could have done was laminate the thin cardboard signs and use a longer more durable holder. These could fall apart and tear with the least amount of use especially in the younger classrooms. Improve durability and it would be a great product."
4,Sea Explorer Boat,My Grandson loves the boat and doesn't go near the pool without it. It was easy to assemble and pretty to look at. Not much power but what can one expect from AA batteries.
5,Max and Ruby,My grandchildren ages 5 and almost 3 love Max and Ruby. This collection was a great success. You get a few episodes--it kept them amused and the dvd was perfect for their age groups. I enjoyed watching with them.
4,it's blues,"it's STAX,it's blues,it's not 'SOUL' (imho)but it's the way to 'SOUL'I bought it as an impression of the variety of STAX' sound"
4,Great Blues from a Great Guitar Player - a great KING!,"The first two blues album I got as a young bloke more than 35 years ago were Albert King's ""Live Wire-Blues Power"" and one by Fleetwood Mac (when they were a proper blues band) I still love blues and ""Live Wire-Blues Power"" still gets played a lot - it is a tour de force that amazed me back then and amazes me now. Albert King is one the greatest Blues Kings and this is worthy addition to any blues collection - but if you like this King and this album you should definitely get ""Live Wire-Blues Power"""
2,Where is the sax section?,"An OK performance by the band, what you can hear of it. Soloists are so-so. The miking is positively amateur.Rhythm is plenty loud as are the soloists that come to the mike. The rest is lousy. Saxes are virtually absent"
5,Strength,"What an amazing book. I laughed and cried at the turn of almost every page. How someone can go through this life and still have such an incredible view on life is truly a wonderful gift. I hope others will gain the knowledge this book offers on coping with life, death and happiness. AWESOME!"
5,Pedro Almodovar Film Music,"I have been watching Mr Almodovar's films for many years, and the music in them played by itself still holds so many images in my head when I play the CD, ESPECIALLY the music from LAW OF DESIRE, from the 1980's with a YOUNG and SEXY Antonio Banderas playing a Bi-Sexual male who's obsessed with a Gay director and will do ANYTHING to be a part of his life.The music from that film is such an important part of that film, but it is also so cool to listen to while cruising the street on a long drive home! I HIGHLY reccommend it!"
4,Pleasant music.,Pleasant music to play while working around the house. Latin jazz in Spanish. Would have like an English version even more although Spanish isn't bad.
4,Songs of Almodovar is a fun and energizing CD.,"You don't need to know any Spanish to enjoy these songs, but it doesn't hurt. Many of them have an uplifting 80s beat while others are sweetly sad. Although the grungy music (track no. 3) can be tiresome, most of the CD is entertaining. If you are strictly anti-80s and you hated ""Fame"" and Gypsy Kings, you may be disappointed. If you like the afore-mentioned and you like to dance, you will love this album. Some personal favorites: No. 5, 11, &13 and so many more. Give Almodovar a try."
1,Does not live up to the quality of his first book,"The development of the characters and the battle of Armageddon were so good in Green's first book. Then in the second book Green brings back several of his old characters and utterly fails to breath the same life and honor into them. If you absolutely must read the book, be aware that as decent as it starts it simply goes downhill every chapter until an utterly pointless ending."
2,"Not so much of a sequel, more of a rewrite","I tried to like this book I really did. But the more that I read the more I had to keep on checking that I was not reading ""Crusade for Armageddon"" by mistake. And not to give away the ending I think there are going to be few people who like the way the book ends. Lets hope that Mr Green improves for the next on in the series."
5,No Fear,"Another great installment for the Black Templars. The Orks are back and now an intrigue plot involving the Imperial Guard.Read the first novel in the series first though, there are flashbacks but you'll be lost."
1,Keep your money,"After seeing several commercial postings in the UsenetNewsgroups about this book, I decided to read it with an openmind. There are many annoying grammatical errors that make it difficult to understand the points the authors Houston Haynes and Carlos Febres attempt to make. A cheaply made book, it's printed on poor paper and will definetely not last-- just like the partial art it describes. Save your money!"
1,PAST IT ON,"After hearing a lot of talk about this book I went ahead and had a look, trying to keep a open mind. What I found was a rather poorly written book that regurgitated most of the same techniques from more established and better Arts. Febres, et al need to focus on the techniques of their arts and strive to be Martial Artist, and quit the ""Ninja"" bit."
3,Modern Ninjutsu - a start,"This book is rather small for the price. The book has some great techniquess (I would call Jujitsu)with the photos. These are very helpful. This is not a book on Ninjutsu as it is, but a good start. Lets hope a sequel covering the ninjutsu side and history follows."
3,"Excellent concepts, fuzzy pictures",Haynes and Febres have done a wonderful job of explain universal martial concepts and their application in ninjutsu. I thought the pictures could have been better. I look forward to the sequel.
1,Authentic,I have never heard of Nindo. The proper name is Ninpo. Mr. Ferbres has an excellent resume but as far as I know authentic Ninjutsu is only taught in the Bujinkan. Koga Ninjutsu is dead. Buyer Beware! When you visit a Doctor you can visibily see his credentials. I will suggest you approach martial arts in the same way. Authentic Ninpo Info on the web.
1,Ninjutsu? Not a Chance,I am very disappointed with this book. All I found when I read it was page afetr page of poorly photographed and poorly executed techniques that are simply borrowed from other sport-oriented martial arts. There is nothing in it even remotely resembling ninjutsu or the unarmed combat methods commonly referred to as taijutsu. This book ranks up there with the very worst the ninja-wannabe crowd has to offer-- stay away!
2,Not worth it!,"I purchased this toy for my 2 year old. The box says 2+ for age recommendation. She loves Dora and was quite excited until she was unable to place the pieces in the backpack easily and she could not manage to get them out without help. She immediatley wanted to put it on her back and wear it but there are no straps. Overall, this toy is a bust and will be returned."
3,Items are difficult to get out of backpack,"I'm finding that the opening to the backpack is small in relation to the camera and the binoculars, and the kids are having a hard time getting their hand inside the backpack and pulling out what they want. They can reach in and grab the item; but, when they go to withdraw their hand with the item in it, their hand hits the narrow opening and this knocks the item out of their hand. So, they tend to tip the backpack upside down and shake it to get the items out. Since you really don't want to make the items smaller, I think the opening needs to be bigger."
2,Forget about it... your child will,"I thought that this was a total waste of money! I wish that I had read the reviews before I spent a dime... or even a nickle on it.The only revealing quality is that it sings the backpack song but after my daughter (2 & 1/2 yrs old) played it a couple of times she forgot about it. Do yourself a favor and buy a real backpack that your child and put on their back and make your own map, put a disposible camera in it and your child will enjoy it much more I promise!"
2,Design Flaw,My daughter (3 1/2) does enjoy this toy which she picked out herself. The major problem with it is that the opening is WAY too small. I have difficulty getting the pieces in and out of the backpack.
4,Great toy until batteries die,"My daughters love this toy. It got many hours/days/months of play. The batteries no longer work and they still play with it. I thought it would be easy to replace the 3 watch batteries but much to my surprise, it cost just as much to replace them as it would to purchase a whole new toy; this is a shame..... In honesty though, the batteries did last a pretty long time."
3,Fun toy for toddlers who r into Dora the explorer,"It's a fun toy not an educational toy.My 3yr old got this for a christmas gift from a friend of mine.One day she had a playdate and a kid 2yrs old fell inlove with it.So i bought this one fr.Amazon.I'm an adult, for me, this is insignificant,the only thing is that the bagpack literally talks.On the other hand,my child just loves to touch bagpacks mouth to hear it speak."
4,backpack,My three year old loves this toy and it has already taken a beating and it has held up great.The only thing I do not like is that it cannot be worn like a backpack- there are no straps on the back so it can only be carried around- kind of defeats the purpose of a backpack. But my 3 year old does not seem to mind- she loves that this toy sings and all the toys that came with it.
2,Think twice before buying,"This toy is not a backpack at all, it is simply a plastic box that talks and contains a few cheap plastic toys.My children were highly disappointed that they could not wear backpack like Dora does. They will carry it by it's handle but get frustrated when the top opens while carrying. The toys contained in the pack are cheaply made and unintersting. It is very hard to get the toys into or out of the small pack opening causing my children to get frustrated again. The only positive to this toy is its talking feature."
3,"Fun, but definitely not perfect.","I bought this for my two year old daughter last weekend. She is a huge Dora fan and she was very excited about it. She plays with it a lot, but she can't get the binoculars, etc. out of the backpack without my help. The bracelet also doesn't stay on her wrist very well. I don't really understand why they didn't put straps on the backpack either, but my daughter really doesn't seem to mind. Overall she really seems to be enjoying the toy, but it could have been designed better."
2,Disappointed,"Even though the toys that come with the backpack are useless and junky, my 4 yr-old really enjoyed carrying the backpack around and playing the songs. She filled it full of other small toys that she liked better, but after less than two months, the voicebox died. What a waste!"
2,Finger Smashing Hazard,"I bought this toy for my two year old. She loves the accessories, however; the opening of the backpack is so small that it is almost impossible to get the camcorder out without smashing her little fingers. She has also smashed her fingers on the hinges as well. She becomes very frustrated with this toy. It does not have straps either so she was disappointed with that. The accessories are cute but there is a serious design flaw with the opening being so narrow. It looks like they have replaced the camera with a smaller one. Maybe that would help."
1,2 Years and Counting of Fun,"We bought this toy for my daughter when she turned three, she is now five and still playing with it. She packs it up and takes it on adventures all the time. The only problem is that now my two year old wants to play with it too. It's true that the accessories don't come with bells and whistles, but they are very durable and encourage imaginative play. This toy has held up to many hours of rigorous play and is still going."
4,My Daughter loves this toy.,We got our 2 year old daughter this toy for Christmas as she loves Dora. She was so excited and loves it. The only problem I have with it is the fact that backpack doesn't have straps for her to wear it. Also there is a little camera that is almost to big and my dd has a hard time getting it out of backpack. Sometimes I even have a hard time getting it out. Other then that it is a great toy.
2,"Okay toy, but hard to find replacement batteries!","I bought this for my daughter when she was about 20 months. She is a big Dora fan, and I thought it would be fun because it plays the song backpack sings in the show, along with the other things backpack says. It is hard to get the toys out of the small opening. She needs help with that from time to time. The worst part about this toy is that the batteries ran out about 4 months after we had it, and we're having a hard time finding replacment batteries for it. It takes 3 small watch type batteries! I don't know why they would make a toy that doesn't take the standard AAA or AA batteries. So consequently, we haven't replaced them.She does still like to carry it around, but is disappointed when the songs and sayings don't play.I wouldn't recommend this toy."
3,NOT a real backpack! May disappoint hardcore fans,"This is not actually a backpack!It is a plastic box with a handle to carry. There are several accessories: a Map, a kalidescope ""telescope"", a nonworking compass and nonworking video camera.For hardcore Dora wannabes, this product may disappoint - it doesn't have a ""star pocket"" or a side pocket for her faithful traveling companion, Map.It's a ""talking"" product but when you take it out of the box and remove the tag from the battery case, the demonstration ""talking"" stops. The included batteries are for demonstration purposes only.It does not take standard batteries, like ""AA"" or ""AAA"" - it takes ""AG 13""(""LR 44"") button-sized batteries which may be harder to find."
2,Not worth the price.,"I both two of these for my 3 year old twin girls. They played for a day or two and then stopped. It's a bit difficult to get the toys out of the backpack. The toys that come with it were disappointing. The camera isn't realistic at all (very small eye view and no push down button to take pretend pictures). The magnifying glass doesn't magnify and the bracelet is too big to fit on their wrists (not adjustable). As far as durability, the backpack cracked in one area when dropped."
2,"A fun toy, but flawed.","My daughter loves this toy. She sits with it as she watches Dora. The reason I am giving this only two stars is for the following reasons: The opening is too small and the video camera barely fits through it. The plastic hinged ""flap"" is actually dangerous. My daughter has gotten her finger caught in it a couple times. Also, who ever saw a backpack that you cannot put on your back (there are no straps)?"
4,calling all dora lover's,my daughter of course LOVES dora and i think it is nice that the backpack talks in spanish and english. my daughter now thanks me for things in spanish:)
3,"It's a backpack, but user friendly","The kids love Dora and her backpack, but this toy just didn't make the grade. The items that come with it are fine. The backpack itself is hard plastic and the opening is very small. The kids have scraped their hands trying to get the items out. The binoculars are hard to get out and everthing else just gets stuck inside."
2,The Dora Back Pack,I was a little unsatisfied with this toy. It is very durable but the toys are very hard to fit inside the plastic back pack. It is also hard to get them in and out of it. My daughter is four and LOVES Dora but she plays more with her fabric Dora back pack more then she plays with the plastic one. It is musical but not very entertaining to her.
2,agree that it's a poor design,"Although you may be tempted to purchase this for your Dora fan, resist. As the others said, the opening is too small, and it isn't even a backback. My 2 year old can't get things in and out, and I can do without the frustrated screaming. My 5 and 7 year olds put Matchbox cars in it- that's about all you can easily get in and out. Given the overload of Dora stuff on the market today, there's got to be something out there for your Dora fan that isn't poorly designed and/or a poor value."
3,Excellent job reducing temperature; frustrating to use,"I was attracted to this particular product because it was a ""custom fit"" for my Subaru. It lives up to that promise - I doubt there is a better fitting product available. It also does an excellent job at reducing the temperature inside the cabin, with or without the windows cracked. If these two points are what you are looking for you may have just found your next sun shield.The one thing I wasn't expecting was how difficult it is to roll up. For this reason, it's just a 3-star ""OK"" rather than a 4 or 5. The product is designed to roll up such that the exterior portion (the shiny side that faces OUT of the car) is on the outside of the roll. However, achieving this inside the car is difficult--mainly because to easily roll it you need to flip it over first. There just isn't a lot of room inside the vehicle to toss around this odd shaped thing. Perhaps practice will make perfect and I'll revisit the review to update after a few weeks."
2,Confused,"G'day !I tried to read the book, but there were too many words that I didn't understand.So, maybe if they included some photos, it would have been better."
2,Its ok.,Not quite what I thought it was going to be. Sort of boring writing. The idea is good though. Wish it was a better book
3,"No, it's not Tuscany","Not Tuscany, nor Provence. This book is not much of anything. It's fluffy and light and if you like to read books that don't make you think too much, or sound more like an article for the ""women's"" section of the newspaper, then this is the book for you. The author has her moments, but unfortunately they are too few and too far apart. Check the book out of the library, don't buy it.As for me, give me books about Tuscany any day. At least they contain descriptions of local spots of interest I can visit."
5,country charm,"Delightful. Fix yourself some ice tea, put your feet up, and pretend that you are sitting among the foxglove and asters in a New England garden, even if you're stuck on the twentieth floor of a New York City high-rise. This is summer in the country as it should be. The pleasures of country life are so vivid, along with the absurdities, the weeds, the mud, the mosquitoes, and the contretemps that can only be dealt with by laughing, that you may be tempted to move to a small, rural village. Unless you happened to also read The Enduring Shore and have decided to move to a saltwater village on Cape Cod. Or to read Bullough's Pond and are looking for a small lake within commuting distance of Boston. Or, well, you could just check them all out of the library and put yor feet up. It's been a great season for books about New England."
2,ho hum,"It is not a great movie, we all know that going into it, it is actually quite bad but, I am not going to talk about what is IN the movie...I am going to talk about the remaster, it is AWFUL, the picture quality is decidly low res....why bother with BlueRay, standard DVD would have produced more than enough bandwith for this..the sound 5.1, should have been left Mono, the remaster of the MMT CD has far far better sound quality....no, I was hoping that this would at least be a decent remaster but not...my expectations should have been lower after buying Yellow Submarine, but, sadly, I was hopeful....this is a dreary and dull remaster of a not very good film...no matter how much I love the Beatles, this feels like a money grab..."
2,Had to use SlySoft to make it run,Must have the wrong country codes. Would not run until I installed my copy of SlySoft on my computer. Good DVD if you can get it to run on your computer. I do not have the latest DVD playback software. That could also be the problem. Playing on a computer. Maybe OK on a Blu-Ray player.
5,MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR,"I'm a Beatle fan of 67 years old. I grew up in the generation of Beatle mania in the 1960s and I've got on Blu-ra, ""A HARD DAYS NIGHT"",& ""YELLOW SUBMARINE"", I'm waiting for the film ""HELP"" to be released on Blu-ray!!. There is a Video not to many people know about, and it's on the Roof top of ABBEY ROAD Studios building called 'THE LET IT BE CONCERT"",I've seen the video on VHS VCR tape. and it is good!!!.MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR has a lot of good songs on it. As far as Albums on CD or Vinyl this one is my favorite Beatle Album then my next favorite Album is ""Help""With graditude, Mr. Bruce H. Moir"
5,"Movie May be Silly, but Who Cares -- It's the Music THat Matters","Yes, the movie is cheaply made and amateurish, but I really don't care, because spliced in between the poor ""acting,"" silly scenes, blurry photography etc is the pure magic of seeing the Beatles performing some of the greatest music ever written. When, the songs start, my heart still jumps, and I forget about the filler in between. In all fairness, this was an experiment for the Beatles; if the cinematic part of the experiment failed, what matters is that the music succeeded beyond all."
3,"Nice, but for fans only","The image quality on the new DVD is GREAT! Much better than I'd hoped for considering the age and the recordings of it to date. However, make no mistake, this one is for fans ONLY! It took my several attempts before I could even make it through the whole thing without cringing. This is essentially a home movie that the Beatles made the mistake of broadcasting. - The commentary track from Paul is good and there is a nice 'making of' segment, but I think they could have done a little better with the extras since they know the movie itself is not that good. They also hid a few cookies on the main menu, which I think should have been just listed in the extras to make it easier for everyone."
3,Just for the memories,"The first LP that I ever bought as a teenager, and had to scrape together the last few quarters as it cost $1.00 more than all the other LPs in 68."
5,A Superb gift,"This was grdered as a gift, it arrived just in time for Christmas & is loved by the recipient. Definatley a good buying experience"
2,Shortchanged!,"I purchased the Blu Ray of this kooky movie. The restoration is excellent with good sound quality and picture quality. Unfortunately, the movie is of historical interest and is actually annoying after the first or second viewing. The reason we want to watch this is the.... MUSIC. It is great to watch the restored I am the Walrus or Your Mother Should Know. However, the original Magical Mystery Tour album/CD contains a second side of songs including Strawberry Fields Forever, Hello Goodbye, Penny Lane, Baby You're a Rich Man and All you need is love. None of the videos for these songs are on this disc except a boring alternate video for Hello Goodbye. For $25 bucks couldn't we get these extra videos with good sound and video quality? Ridiculous. And there is no booklet."
4,Won't play on a computer,"I am happy to get a blu ray of MMT at such a reasonable price. I looked forward to playing it on my HP Pavillion PC. It won't play.I tried various player software, all say that an AAC Codec is missing from them, that is needed. Is this some scam by Sir Paul andApple? I paid for the disc,Magical Mystery Tour [Blu-ray], why can't I watch it any way I wish? BTW it does play on PS-3. Are they trying to prevent downloadingto hard-drive? How do I just get to watch with the convenience of my computer's peripherals, like 5.1 sound system and a decent graphics card and HD monitor? Just what gives here?"
2,1080i Seriously?,"Come on. What is the benefits of 1080i anymore? They did the exact same transfer for HELP! That DVD was taken from an 1080i HD master, and the interlacing showed! Combing all over the place. Why oh why would you put any HD on 1080i anymore?! I understand that it was shot for TV broadcast, but the camera negatives is 16mm, 24 fps, 1080p ready. Why would you make the blu ray 1080i at 60 fps. 0 for 3 man, Miramax butchered A Hard Day's Night, HELP! as mentioned previously, also taken from an 1080i HD master (see the restoration doc on the extra features if you don't see the combing while watching movie), and now MMT, on blu ray, great! 1080i, Boooo!"
1,Must-have crappiness,"It's every bit the piece of crap I knew it to be but I had to have it anyway. Fortunately, this is the only real piece of junk they produced so everything else is great. Buy it if you must but know what you're getting."
3,Surround Sound,"I consider myself a big Beatles fan and had never seen this before. I wasn't expecting much due to reviews of previous incarnations of this movie so therefore I wasn't really disappointed in the movie itself. I mainly got this to rip the surround music tracks in order to make a Beatles surround compilation from this and other sources such as Yellow Submarine, Help, Anthology and the Love dvd audio. A Hard Days Night unfortunately had little in the surround channels. My complaints with MMT was that although they included a video clip for Hello Goodbye in the Extras it was only in stereo. I was also disappointed that they did not include the Strawberry Fields video clip at all in the extras."
5,53 MINUTES OF BLU-RAY BLISS,"When I first watched this movie as a kid I thought it was very tedious except for the brilliant musical segments. Watching it now as an old man I'm surprised how short the film is (only 53 minutes). It goes by really quickly in spite of some of the (for some people) boring comedy scenes. 75% of the new remastered film is high resolution audio of the best music The Beatles ever recorded IMO, and that makes this Blu-ray release of MMT absolutely essential. We have the vinyl set coming soon, but this BD has really got me salivating for the catalog on Blu-ray (or SACD or DVD-Audio)."
3,Sometimes jambs,"I have found this nailer to jamb when more than one ""stick"" of nails is loaded at a time. When you only load one stick of nails there is no problem. I am pleased over all with the quality and operation of this nailer for my infrequent use. I built a Well House and a storage shed.If you are buying a nailer to use commercially or professionally, I would not recommend this one for those purposes."
4,Thunder Alley is a book for all Fighter Plane fans!,"Led by a maverick flyer named Ryder Long who believes all rules are made to be brocken, a handful of misfits, rebels and flying fools make up the mission that alone can stop the mysterious twentieth-century warlord, Colonel Toon, in his Southeast Asian fortress.The target of Long's mission, called Thunder Alley, has never been penetrated by hostile forces; it is a graveyard of the best and the bravest. As Ryder Long prepares his mission, time is running out-the deadline for the death of the world approaches."
1,Mis represented product,When I purchased this product it said that it was a HK7400 STEERING KIT AND SAID NOTHING ABOUT IT BEING A GALLON OF OIL. Now that I recieved it and complained I see that they have now changed the description to reflect what it really is. I would never have purchased it if I had know it was oil.
4,I bit disappointing.,"I thought this would be more than it is. Marek Drewnoski's playing is excellent but what spoils this video is the camera shots away from the performer. We are subjected to a tour and views of the palace and its artifacts while the music is playing. A few surreptitious shots would have been acceptable but not the 75% coverage we are forced to endure. In particular, the camera takes us on a tour of all the clocks in the place while the 'Minute Waltz' is being played. Which I found extremely aggravating. But the filming and playing is good so I generously give it 4 stars."
2,Christianity and Islam: The Final Clash,"Robert Livington's book, Christianity and Islam: The Final Clash. has some problems in my opinion. He does not understand the rules of Apolcalytic Prophecy. He does not apply the four rules of prophecy. He says on page 64 of his book that, ""Jesus taking the scroll is the completion of the Great Commission."" The Great Commission will not be completed until the 144,000 preach the pure gospel 1260 days into the Great Tribulation.Then the gospel will be completed.(Rev. 14) Concerning the scroll that Jesus takes from the right hand of the Father, Jesus is being exalted in Heaven. Then Jesus opens the first seal in 1798. Daniel saw the same thing. There are good points in this book, but the book is very misleading."
1,Rubbish!,"Like the vast majority of books on ""the end times"" this one is pure religious science fiction.For a Scripturally sane and classically Christian view I recommend LAST DAYS MADNESS by Gary Demar, THE BEAST OF REVELATION by Kenneth Gentry Jr., DAYS OF VENGEANCE by David Chilton [just reprinted!] THE GREATNESS OF THE GREAT COMMISSION by Kenneth Gentry Jr., POSTMILLENIALISM: AN ESCHATOLOGY OF HOPE by Keith A. Mathison and HE SHALL HAVE DOMINION: A POSTMILLENIAL ESCHATOLOGY by Kenneth Gentry Jr.These books fully engage and Scripturally refute the lunatic ravings which have prevailed since the days of Scofield and Darby."
2,revelation stretch,A Christian Fundamentalist interpretation of Islam as the Beast of Revelation. There are better sources for an understanding of the relationship between Christianity and Islam.
1,"BUYER BEWARE Don't be fooled, these ARE NOT originals!","I looked at the glowing reviews for this CD set and failed to read them carefully -- one reviewer said ""Brits Ken Barnes and Pete Moore selected a large number [of Bing's songs] and added full stereo orchestral and choral accompaniment. This gives us Bing in prime voice, but with more modern arrangement."" Therefore, if you want REAL Bing, as HE recorded the songs, this CD is not for you. The songs have now been Nat King Cole-ified or smooth jazz-ified with 80s/90s straight tone a capella style singers. There's nothing wrong with these styles of jazz, but they're just not Bing! Absolutely no vibrato from the backup singers, horrors!"
4,The Best of Bing Crosby [2 CDs],"The ""Best of Crosby"" title does not match the content, as too many songs seem to be just filling space. Nobody would ever rank the opening song about golf, for example, as one of Crosby's best. On the other hand, his command of so many pieces, both jazz and pop, help one recall just good he was/is."
2,Fan comes apart.,"The fan is a direct factory replacement for my furnace, But it did just like the origianl did . the fan came off of the shaft. It is a great unit if it would just stay together, the fan has no way to hold it on the shaft other than a little spring wound around the plastic sleeve,, I even tried to super glue and then a 2 part epoxy. same thing runs a few days then k-put!!! If any one has any ideas at to a replacement fan let me know, Thanks rl"
4,Eye opening experience,Ellis Cole is an excellent author. The book is well put together. His writing sytle is easy to follow. It actually give you somethings to think about. It's a very informative book. I'd suggest reading his books if you get a chance.
2,Not the original top 40 recordings!,"Could there be more than one version of this CD, ""The Best of the Drifters, Saturday Night At the Movies"" being sold on Amazon? Despite the glowing reviews above, I was very disappointed in this album. Not one of the songs are the original recordings we all remember from the radio. It says right on the liner notes (at the bottom), ""This album consists of re-recordings"". It's hard to feel nostalgic about recordings you've never heard before."
5,Having a fundamental issue with purchasing this book.,"After reading the account of the author's legal problems broughton by the publisher, I cannot bring myself to purchase a copyof the book. This book, together Eric's experiences, amountto a significant turning point in the history of the relationshipbetween an author and his publisher. It stands as an example ofhow corporations have become entirely too powerful against anindividual. It is inconcievable that such circumstances have prevailed. The worst part is that the publisher's actions will continue to stifle development of the work!"
1,Support Eric Weisstein but DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"This book is the centerpiece of a very scary and disturbing legal altercation in which the publisher, CRC Press LLC, basically tried to strong-arm Eric W. Weisstein into gaining complete control over the material on his mathworld website, after he signed a contract for them to publish this book, which is essentially a snapshot of the material.I would urge everyone to show personal support for Eric W. Weisstein in whatever way possible--donations are a great idea. However, by buying this book you are supporting a company that is greedy and downright creepy. You're also encouraging other companies to do the same.We need to show the publishing industry that greed does not pay--and one great way of doing that is by not buying this book."
3,"Bright, yet limited.","I have been over various portions of the book, and I find it well done. I do tend to feel that the encyclopedia at hand, however, should have been written with more tact. In order to have a thouroughly clear over-view of the novel (because it is an encyclopedia) there must be a wider range of editing and compilation of the said material. Eric: job well done. Additionaly, It would be more benificial for others and yourself (as a learning process) to seek other peoples' advice and knowledge on the material - like many textbooks...very humbling, yet, extremely benificial.Justin J. Ouellette"
2,One-person's work are very limited as an Encyclopedia,"This book is quite impressive as a personal note, but does not deserve to be considered as anything formal as being a dictionary or encyclopedia. The information are way too idiosyncratic and contains too many factual errors, ommisions, and misleadings. I strongly advise you not to buy the first edition. As of 1999, the definitive math encyclopedia in English is still Ecyclopedic Dictionary of Mathematics (EDM), published by MIT Press. Unfortunately, EDM is written for mathematicians, and is not up-to-date (it was translated from Japanese in 1977.). It is quite hopeless for such massive work as this to be up-to-date. EDM gives an very dense outline and definitions for almost all (modern) math areas. Each section is written by an expert in that area. If you have an undergraduate degree in math, buy EDM. If your math interest is recreational, then Eric's can be enjoyable.Xah Lee"
1,"Love the website, hate CRC","The website is superb and even more comprehensive than the text.Further, after reading the account of how the barbarians at CRC treated the production of this book, I now categorically dispense any and all CRC literature directly to the garbage can without even opening. As an academic, I will never again consider any of their offerings for any of my academic duties or courses.Don't waste your time with the book. Use the website and avoid CRC."
2,Authoritative but disappointing,"This text has a plethora of information regarding anything mathematics has to offer, however it has some limitations. For example, its commentary on probability and applied statistics is lacking in depth, perhaps from the author's lower level of interest in these topics. The same information that can be found in this book, only more up-to-date, is freely available in the public domain. However, the book does look interesting on the coffee table and can be the centre of conversation."
3,Not as good as expected,"I bought this thinking it would be great for my garden, but the rotating blades are not sharp at all and it barely pulls up any of the weeds. I wouldn't get this if your trying to keep the weeds down in your garden, better to use a hoe. It might be ok for prepping the soil before planting, making some rows with two blades on the outside, or keep weeded soil around your garden turned up. But, for removing weeds it kind of rolls right over them and you keep having to go over the same spot many many times and still not a good result."
5,"yep, definetly an amend","this is the coolest strip ever written! I enjoy it on an almost daily basis(they don't deliver the paper on mondays.) But back to the book, a family of five deals with the mom's mid-life crisis, the dad's football obsession, 10-year-old-boy's Einstienic brainpower, 14-year-old-girl's boy crazines, and 16-year-old-boy's amazingly bad driving skills. A true masterpiece of capturing the essence of suburbian life. Also try Calvin&Hobbes."
5,Bill Amend has done it again!,"Bill Amend has created several treasuries, including ""Enormously Foxtrot"" and ""Camp Foxtrot"". This book is ""wildly"" hilarious and the rereading factor is greater than almost any other 'comic book that has ever existed in the past,say, 1999 years. If you buy it, you certainly will NOT regret it."
5,Great color tape to have when everyone else uses BLUE!,"What can I say, some people in some professions just NEED masking tape but everyone seems to have the dark blue color. We use this particular colored tape to mark and number some points along a wall. The light green color enables us to see the writing on the tape and the other contractors/electricians/whomever don't confuse the tape for theirs and rip it off the wall.Of course we use this type of tape to not damage any paint on the wall. Thx for offering this color Amazon! It just so happens to be my favorite color anyway."
2,A disappointment,"When shopping, I was excited by the list of songs on the CD and was looking forward to listening. Unfortunately, the songs lack the wonderful vocals and orchestral back-up I was expecting. Many of the songs have that 'Hammond Organ' sound. I am disappointed."
3,Best of!,I was dissapointed but it has no bearing on the recording. It's just not what I expected it to be.
4,Mancini- of the 60's,Everyone who lived through the sixties and enjoyed the many movies that came out then would appreciate this collection of some of his most well known of his songs.
5,Fresh and exciting with a wonderful new sound.,"Scott Brannon has created a wonderful new musical format for the dulcimer on his CD ""Expedition.""Melodically beautiful and rhythmically exciting, Brannon's dulcimer music is a must for those people looking for that fresh and original new sound."
1,Expedition: Adventures on Hammer Dulcimer,Extremely disappointing. I sat through one complete listening of this CD and promptly threw it in the trash. It is a pity to take such a versitile instrument and reduce to a lot of new age noise. Eonough said.
1,Just plain C rappy,"I bought a Nyko Worm Cam a while ago and I am really disappointed. It advertises that it takes great digital pictures but it really doesn't. It is very slow and hard to use and the color is always grainy and dull. If you try to print your pictures they always come out blurry if you print them any bigger than wallet size. It is also hard to aim your picture, it doesn't have any sort of view finder or anything like that. And if you take pictures outside and it's a cloudy day you STILL have to use that small easy to lose sun filter. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this lousy piece of [junk] and I hope you don't either..."
1,reviews do not lie MOst say it's crap (because it's crap,"This is the biggest piece of junk i have ever wasted my money on in my life. I thought it should take good enough pictures for a four year old. I didn't expect great quality. Just expected a cheep looking photo. WRONG. I played with the settings as one review suggested and all i got no-matter what setting was BLACK dark screens, or white and gray lines of distortion. You could not even make out what you are taking a picture of. If you want a camera look for something else. This is a waste of money no-matter how cheep it is."
5,This is the COOLEST thing ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This Worm Cam is GREAT! It takes perfect pictures!!! It's smalland comes with a lense so you can take pictures in the sun !!! And you can also save the pictures on your computer by simply instaling a program. Then print them I give the wormcam 5 stars, it's awesome. If your thinking of geting one that's a great idea. I got mine from the people who sell thiers on this web site but I don't know why they would want to sell this awesome camera."
1,DO NOT BUY! I REPEAT DO NOT BUY!!!!,"This is a cheap camera. It doesn't take pictures at all! Trust, I got the camera, and it is HORRIBLE! Please, if you really want to get a gameboy camera , do not get this! You know on the cover it has a High Res. picture of a dog on it, that is COMPLETLEY FAKE!!!! When you take a picture on the camera, all it you see is either black, white, or a very unviewable picture! And I am telling the true, true truth. But there other gameboy cameras avalible, like the original gameboy camera, that you can find here on amazon. The only thing is that the orignal gameboy camera takes black'n'white pictures. The only thing I want to tell you is, DO NOT GET THIS GBA CAM AT ALL!!!!"
1,What's the point of a digital camera that doesn't save????,"Yes you can hook it up to a computer and upload your pictures, yes it's color, yes it has the spy cam mode, but you can't save the pictures on the GBA!!! It says you can, but it hardly ever works for me. If someone knows why this is happening, or does not ever have this problem[?]..."
2,what the heck is this?????,"I picked this THING up today, and there's one word to describe it...HORRIBLE. The pictures that you take are so unclear and bad. On the box, it shows a nice clean, crisp picture, but on the actual screen the pictures suck. Every picture I take turns out completly black, or hardly there. The original GAMEBOY camera is way better. Don't make the same mistake that I made. You will regret losing you money on this peice of junk."
1,Please don't buy.,"Years ago I asked for, and got, this Nyko camera for my GBA. Taking pictures with it is fairly easy and it has a bunch of nice features and modes for it. Picture quality is horrible, though. Even in the correct modes, the best quality pics were not easy to even recognize what it was of. The pc uploading software is basic and worthless for two reasons.1.It won't work correctly on newer PCs.2.As bad as the pictures are that it takes, you won't even want to save them. You'd be embarrassed to be seen saving them.Please, for your own sake, if you want a GBA camera, save your money and buy a good one."
4,Wonderful Soundtrack,Wonderful Soundtrack from a terrific movie. Only one song that I loved was omitted (In the Jungle--Wimoweh).
3,"More score, less opera please","Phillip Glass's score was exceptional, why there isn't more of it on the rousing soundtrack, I can't imagine, but the lack leaves a hole in the overall CD."
1,"Won't play on iTunes, useless!",The anti piracy protection spoils this CD. I can't play it on my computer or iPod.Useless to me.
1,Never received,Disgraceful service. I was told this would be delivered by 24 december and I still haven't received it. I doubt I will use amazon again.
1,Joyful Listening,"Celebrating food and good relationships, this movie was very touching to me. Now we can relive the movie with the wonderful music--it is perfect to be in the kitchen drinking wine, cooking pasta, AND listening to the wonderful opera in this CD. Love it!"
5,No reservations.,I certainly have no reservations in recommending this CD to anyone who loves a good mix of music. Mostly classial with a touch of Jazz and Mambo! Great dinner party music. It will really add a swing to your evening and make you want to dance! Definintely one of my favourite CD's.
4,LIGHT ITALIANO AMBIENCE,"I enjoyed the movie - romance, food and music - and the CDreflects this. Nice tracks to cook eat and romance to! Would bea safe bet to purchase as a gift."
2,Not great for me.,"My own darn fault--I should have read the description more carefully. This soundtrack has lots of opera music on it, which is not for me. If you love opera, though, go for it! And the movie is a great chick-flick!"
2,less is not more.,I've bought a lot of cookbooks. I just gave this one away. Getting a good book cheap is good. Getting a poorly done book cheap is just throwing your money away.
2,Dont Do It without Reading This First!,"This is about the size of a pamphlet, it IS NOT A BOOK. The recipes are fine but they are by no means innovative, new or perhaps ""the 50 best"". They are many of the standard variations plus a few poorly conceived versions just to get the number to 50. The only photo is in the cover. HOWEVER, this is useable as a pocket guide for things you want to try when going to a sushi bar or if you are traveling or doing rolls at home or with friends. It is in fact pocket sized. I spent between $4-$5 for it (free shipping) and I felt cheated. But I will leave it with a friend who is nurturing the urge to create their own rolls at home as a starters guide. Although pictures would tremendously help that person, the internet can give some videos with basic roll construction and this ""mini-book"" can provide counter top ingredients at the time of assembly."
2,No pictures?,"The information here is fairly good, but you would do much better with photographs. Sushi and Japanese cuisine in general is about visual art as well as taste, and you can not learn too much here. Not a bad reference book for a sushi chef to keep on the shelf for names of popular selections and for the price, you could do worse. (Mike-executive chef & sushi creator for 20 years.)"
4,Great idea,My husband has been reading this book from front to back. We will be shopping soon and getting the necessary items to start making his own sushi. Well written book. Very inspiring.
4,"50 ideas for sushi rolls for $5, that's all","This is not a great book or instructional. These are not exactly the 50 ""best"" sushi rolls, either. But it gives 50 good ideas for sushi rolls for $5. Like adding an ""island flavor"" to a particular fish roll, by adding coconut. It's not useful for someone who is just learning how to make sushi, but for $5, it doesn't promise to be instructional or enlightening."
4,A fun little gift item,"I think it's amusing to find everyone taking something--that's not supposed to be a serious book on sushi--so seriously! If you are a fan of some of the crazy rolls we see on sushi menus these days (and there are pletny of them), this tiny book plays up to that. At four bucks from a company with a line of these little 'Best of' series, what does one expect?"
3,Sushi rolls,"This book has nice ideas, i would have though there would be more of them though. pictures would be nice."
1,Not worth the four dollars,"I think a better book on sushi could have been written by a dyslexic ape. It seems like the author, never having seen sushi, did some web browsing and wrote a book. There are recipes in this book for PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY SUSHI ROLLS. It's beyond wrong. BACON, LETTUCE, AND TOMATO SUSHI ROLLS. I can only assume this book is someone's idea of a sick joke."
1,Waste of Money!!!!,"This book was a joke!! It was an actual insult to Japanese cuisine. I thought that this was going to be a nice little book with recipes for some great sushi rolls, but I got surprised!! There are no pictures or diagrams what-so-ever except the one on the cover. And the sushi rolls that they have listed are horrible......""goat cheese, corn, and basil roll"", ""blt roll"", and ""peanut butter and jelly roll"". Get real.Don't even waste your money on this book. It should have a negative rating if that was possible."
1,Keep looking,No photos except the one on cover. Very small 41/2 x 6 inches. and I was expecting a lot more. Keep looking for a better book on sushi.
1,"Disturbing, to say the least","This is by far the most retarted book on sushi i have ever seen. It almost makes me embarrased to call myself an American. I have NEVER seen anything like this before, and im sure the sushi bars all over America who make wonderful authentic Japanese sushi would be mortified to see this book.none of the recipes sound good at all, and its a huge disapointment considering it's titles claim. at most, the so called 'western' sushi recipes look and sound disgusting."
2,Not what I expected,"These are basically recipes for sushi rolls I've never heard of. No recipes for the classic rolls like the J&B, Mexican and Hurricane. I would have liked something a little less ""creative"" and a little more authentic."
4,The Moonlight Gondola,"""The fabled romance of Venice seemed a mockery to Prudence Tarrant. Left penniless by the death of her beloved brother, she came to this foreign city not as the lady she was born, but as a scorned governess to the ambitious Heriot family.""This story is a Venetian Cinderella story where the ""prince's"" name is Lord Colin Erskine.Judith Heriot is the wicked ""stepsister"" who is constantly making trouble for Prudence and I guess you can figure it out from there.I bought this book many years ago when story lines in the romance genre were simpler. I liked the story because of the location and the mystery of the brother's death. Even though the story is short (204 pages), it manages to build reasonable character developments that kept my interest until the end.I can recommend this book to anyone who likes a decent mystery romance from the 70's that has no foul language and some really sweet moments. I hope you enjoy the ride."
3,Not as good as previous releases.,Synthesisers swamp and cover up the lack of inspiration in this CD. I unreservedly recommend the previous discs but not this one.
2,Do you need to have sprintpcs web for this thing to work,"this refers to using this product with sprintpcs samsung 8500 phone.I keep getting ""no carrier detected"" with this thing, and the phone does not show any message, on its screeen. The phone is samsung 8500.The palm pc that I have connects with no problem at all with the normal modem, to the same ISP, same number.Do you need to enable data on the phone through sprint? Do you need to pay for the wireless web from sprint to get this to work"
3,Definitely Not For Younger Audiences,"It is geared more towards hardcore/older audiences not because of offensive material, but because of it's difficulty. Older Mega Man games were fun for everyone regardless of what kind of gamer you were, but these are directed towards 1)those who love Megaman, 2) are hardcore gamers (that is, those who are dedicated towards their games and gameplay), and 3) those who can take a beating and return for more. This game in normal mode won't necessarily tear your hair out, but it's hard mode will make you bald quickly. I myself LOVED hard mode; it's like a shout-out to how hard Nintendo games were. So, if you are sick of playing easy games, this will definitely satiate your thirst. I definitely cannot give it a 5 because it's not as accessible to all ages (even to the older ages), so I give it an average score."
2,"Doesn't remove nitrate, nitrite as it claims on bottle","I purchased this item mainly to remove nitrate and nitrite. By testing it with a test kit, it doesn't do anything as it claims on the bottle. It probably does what it claims, but nothing that would cause a change on the after test. Oh, I also doubled the dosage, NOTHING.It could be a great water conditioner, since after all those years of being in the business. But if it doesn't do what it claims, its a big fail to me."
2,Great moments.... but Stax should have done better,"This collection is not worth the full price of a CD today when money is funny and change is strange. Missing are the duets, b-sides and alternative versions for this ""Greatest Hits"" compliation. Two blown up photos & 2 paragraphs by Dr. Mable John, who has more billing on this CD than Carla herself. If Stax is out reinvent itself with their catalog, the label should spend some money on a historian / writer to document this beautiful soul darling's career. Who is she if one wants to know her more."
5,It's not quantity but the quality of the experience,"Some others complain they didn't get a toy in their Happy Meal. If you want a lot of food for a low price then hog down at Micky Ds. However, if you are looking for a fine meal, you'll pay for what you get. This album has been mastered with great sound and the song selections were cherry picked by someone who KNOWS. I agree with the comment that ""Gee Whiz"", alone is worth the price of the album. However, most of the songs are worth a 5 star rating. Carla in her prime! Her voice and style takes me back to the '60s; to when I was young and its an express ride. Just like a scent is considered to be thee most powerful of the senses to evoke a memory; listening to Carla Thomas takes me THERE."
2,too much of the same thing,"This album has a lot of songs that are basically alike. They're almost all trite, mid-tempo pop songs about love. Even the chord changes are the same: ""icecream changes"" (I IV IV V), over and over again, with an augmented chord thrown in as a gimmick on the V chord. Several of the reviewers here have complained that there's not enough material on this disc, but actually by the time I was done listening to it I was wishing that I had heard even less of the same old same old."
2,Disappointed,I purchased a pair of these clogs and was disappointed. The clogs appear to be well made but they're very uncomfortable and don't cover as much of the foot as I thought they would from the photos. The soles are also very slick. I purchased a pair of clogs from Lands End for half the price that I like a lot better. I'll be sending these back.
3,"Barrelhouse piano blues-great piano, ok songs","Victor Wainwright can play some piano. If you enjoy that rockin' blues piano that is rarely found today, you could do a lot worse than Wainwright's debut. While the songs are not particularly memorable and a bit derivative, the underlying talent behind them shines through. I'd definitely give this artist another shot as his songwriting talent matures to match his piano playing chops."
1,Walking Point--an adolescent rip off,"James Watson's ""Walking Point"" is adolescent, narcissistic and self-serving. And it is poorly written, boring and old hat. Fully the first half of the book is superficial storytelling about the fraternity-like partying, drinking and womanizing, laced with a good dose of ""just how damn tough SEAL team members are."" ""Walking Point,"" as a title, is a gross misrepresentation, obviously chosen only to sell the book to those unaware and not at all an honest title concerning the content. This book is a rip off, and its just too bad there is no way to get a refund. Are there no ethical marketing standards in the publishing business? It is surprising there aren't more negative reviews-readers are probably falling over from boredom and simply lack the energy. Attempting to read this will take away valuable time from reading something of substance, and in that sense, ""Walking Point"" is a double crime."
5,Excellent acting.Beautiful localle.magnificent score!,Wonderfully acted rendition of this classic American novel.Liam NeesonPatricia Arquette and Joan Allen areexcellent in bringing this tale of truelove and betrayal to life.Rachel Portman's mournful yet beautiful score lends itself to the story as well as thebreathtaking vistas of Kings Mountain inVermont.A must see!
3,Scandalous!,"I was a bit disappointed in this movie, even though I love Liam Neeson. It wasn't the love story I was anticipating."
4,A customer's opinion,"I enjoyed this movie very much. I thought it was well acted and haunting. It is not a happy story, but it is powerful. A tragic love story indeed, and a fine adaptation of a classic novel."
3,Review of Ethan Frame,"Generally, the adaption from the book to screen was well done. I thought Zeena could have been played as more of an excentric character and more of a hypochondriac - which worked well in the novel. Ethan Frome was played well, and the cast worked well on screen. The chemistry between Ethan and Mattie was well picked up on,from the audience's perspective.Overall, this film was a good one. I probably wouldn't recommend you rent it for a Saturday night at home though - read the book, i found this more descriptive and visual."
3,Not for those with hearing difficulties,No subtitles for hearing disabled and no cc. I think all dvd's should provide one or the other to help people know what the film is saying. I enjoyed the book and would like to enjoy the film
3,disappointed,"After all the great reviews I was excited to watch this movie. I found it rather dull and didn't see the great romance to the degree others did. It isn't a movie I would watch twice. Liam did the best job but the actresses, none will stick in my mind as memorable."
3,Just okay,"Make sure you have strong signal strength available as this product appears to add considerable resistance to the circuit. Also, the switching mechanism is a bit flimsy feeling although it does do the job."
5,"Treat Yourself to Readings--A Book to Keep, Not Borrow","As a long-time reader and admirer of Michael Dirda's column in the Washington Post, I was pre-disposed to enjoy this collection; I was not disappointed. Clearly, having his varied columns in book form that offers the luxury of permanency and pondering demonstrates once again how McLuhan's ""medium is the message"" applies. The personal ruminations, recommendations, and vignettes are even more powerful than the weekly column, and I take the author's advice to heart--that is to read the pieces slowly and not try to read the book from cover to cover. For me, its richness lies in reading, reflection, and savoring this fine writer's most satisfying way with words."
5,good book for a rainy afternoon,"I spent the afternoon reading, smiling and occasionally laughing out loud. I have always imagined I was the most addicted reader I knew -- but, Dirda gets the prize.He tells us about pouncing on a find like a ""rabid marmoset"" and sneaking books into the house to hide them from the ""Beloved Spouse.""His taste is catholic and he is a good writer. I think any reader will enjoy his essays."
3,"A threefer, kind of...","Two movies, and an animated ""short"" they call a movie. Good thing the other two are good scifi..."
3,Alright,"These movies are ok, nothing special. If you like this genre of movies, see Resident Evil or Alien series. The movies lenght is good, 5 hours in all."
2,A waste of his time,"I loved Pitch Black and I made the wrong assumption on this DVD. This does not do ""Vin"" any justice, stick to the Fast and Furious."
2,NMot too bad,okayy i had already seen The Chronicles of Riddick and was suggested by a friend to watch Pitch Black. Now i liked The Chronicles of Riddick i thought it was a good movie. when i saw Pitch Black i was confused. the two stories barley tie together. The graphics are not as good in Pitch Black as they are in Chronicles of Riddick. Also the animated movie is terrible. Dark Fury is a let down. Im not trying to bash these movies because i like The Chronicles of Riddick but that is the only one i really like. Also this set is about $10 cheaper at Wal Mart.
3,I didn't want to like it...but I did.,"I am not a sci-fi fan, but this story line is stimulating, and the filming is not 'B'. While the 'Chronicles of Riddick' was a neat movie, seeing the entire thought process and story line is truly impressive."
1,Very decieving,The trilogy is actually a ploy.It gives you the appearance of getting 3 movies.You do not !!!!Dark Fury is a cartoon that is such poor quality it is laughable.Pitch Black has extremely vulgar language.Chronicles of Riddick is a very good movie that has good acting and special affects.Save your money and just get Chronicles of Riddick only. The other 2 arent worth a nickel
5,Excellent,"Its a great movie. I love it. And it a excellent buying for the price. Thanks. Amazing, extraordinary, great, awsome."
5,great,I purchased this as a gift for my son and he was extremely happy. I liked the way it was packaged..very happy
4,Almost perfect package,"I loved the idea of having the whole trilogy in one nice simple package. I only removed one star because I would have preferred more ""extras"". I'm a sucker for special features :-)In any case, a very convenient package at a great price."
5,Loved this set of movies,"These movies are so cool. I rented the Chronicles of Riddick from Hastings and loved it so much I had to buy it. Having the whole series in this easy package makes the last movie so much more interesting. The first movie introduces the character of Riddick and explains the connection he and Jack (the girl whose life he saves) have. Plus, for those of us who enjoy mixing diffrent genres the first movie is action horror where the third and final movie is more action drama. The second movie helps provide an explanatory bridge between the two. Also, it is a great way to see the developement of Jack and Riddick's trust relationship. However I still wish that the producers had been able to use the actors instead of animated characters in The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury. All around a really good set of movies. Buy it if you like great action, a love story, evil monsters, and good (or should I say better) guys against the evil ones."
5,Comprehensive,"Finally, a computer book that looks at the task at hand beyond the computer. I was looking for a book to help me do a decent looking web site on my own. This is the book to get. They talk about ALL aspects of the process - from how to write and plan the content to writing the HTML to do it AND everything in between like hosting, fonts to use, colors,... everything. I have found this to be a rare commodity in info systems books. This book gives you advice based on their experience and lets you know what to expect if you don't follow it. This is what I want in a computer book, not a step by step guide on how to execute menu items. This is truly a well-written book and I wish the authors would do many others. Good job!"
3,This one goes to eleven,"As noted in the only other review, the guitarist was not present at the live concert; he was dubbed in later. So isn't it ironic that this disc is titled ""The Real Deal""? Vanilla Fudge likes to claim that it was a big influence on Led Zeppelin, but clearly they inspired Spinal Tap. Three stars for stupidity."
5,Best Home Country Cookbook around!,"The book was a perfect gift for a women who has everything and loves cookbooks! It is unique and fun, and FULL of wonderful food!!!"
1,DID NOT WORK - CAN NOT RETURN,The compressor worked for about 2 minutes then stoppped. I tried to return but amazon would not take back. They said I had to deal with the manufacturer. So I did. The repair center is 140 miles away (round trip). They cannot even look at it for 3 weeks plus. Amazon is not up front with their return policies. Will not purchase again from Amazon.
2,James Last Seduction,"The other review of this CD is all raves. Frankly, I havent figured out what Last was trying to accomplish with this CD. This music is just So SoI wouldnt have bought it if I had had a chance to listen to samples."
1,not what we expected,"we were looking for ""Seduction"" played by the James Last Orchestra. this version is okay, but it isn't the version we expected. it seems difficult to find accurate information at times. it's too bad all albums don't show the back on the album and the liner notes to determine if the content is what should be expected."
1,Terrible Quality,"Very very bad quality. Like listening to music through a tunnel. On the other hand, sounds just like the cassette dub someone gave me for a gift in the mid-80s."
3,Not bad but nothing unique.,I didn't dislike this story. I read it through but there was nothing new or interesting enough to draw me in that much. I would say I enjoyed the characterization. Call me cazy. I even liked her Gribbin. Not a page turner for me but not a bad read.
2,Not that great,"I have two types of suet, and this one does not appear to attract birds like the other suet. Maybe it's the time of year for this portion of the country, but other suet attracted a lot more birds. Considering the positive reviews this suet received I expected it to be at least as good as the other suet I was using."
1,Toaster,"Ordered on November 17, 2006, As of January 8, 2007, Have still not received this product, there has been communication about my order, hopefully I will receive it soon."
1,Not what I was looking for,"I recieved this and as soon as I opened the box knew it was not for me. The outside of the toaster looked as if someone had scratched it up with sand paper. It was not even a black anymore. As for how it worked I am not sure, I didn't even try it."
3,Nothing special but a good buy for the price.,This toaster is a Consumers Reports Best Buy. It is cheap. The only thing about it that is special is that the toast usually is evenly toasted. It takes forever and one can get their fingers burned pulling toast out if they are not careful because toast doesn't stay popped up when it is finished. Can't toast sourdough or large slices and it is uneven on crusts. Toasting any bread that is not the standard loaf has to be done in a toaster oven but one never gets toast in a toaster oven that is evenly toasted.
1,Lousy toaster,This toaster is terrible. It takes forever for the bread to get toaster. It is so light weight it requires two hands to put down the toast - one hand to hold the toaster so it doesn't tip over and one hand to push the lever. I wouldn't recommend this toaster!
4,Does the job.,"Why spend alot of money on something that just toasts bread?? This toaster does the job and is a great value! My bread turns out okay, but my eggo waffles get slightly darker on the middle and bottom half than they do on the top half..but I really dont care and neither does my family. I'm glad I decided to buy this toaster and saved myself alot of money."
3,Not bad for an inexpensive toaster.,I like the way it looks but it seems to leave more crumbs underneath it than any other toaster I've owned before. I empty the tray a lot but it doesn't seem to make that much difference. Its a fair deal for the price
4,Sun Studios Overrun by Punks!,"This is a great CD. I don't really know this band's previous recordings, and picked this up more on chance than recommendation, but I've been very happy I found it (Okay, I admit it--I found it in a used bin. Some loser sold it, and I picked it up on the cheap. But now that I've heard it, I'd pay full price). It swings in spots like a rock-a-billy band ought to--I'm thinking specifically of 'Little Caesar'--but in others its full of passion--and here I'd cite 'In the Woods of Hemlock Park', which is a great (and practically anthemic) song. This has been a great addition to my collection, and I'm scouring used CD bins everywhere to see what other great CDs this same loser who sold this one is unloading."
2,.,"I picked this one up on a whim, too (see last review), but my experience was a little different. I'll concede that Little Caesar is a pretty happenin' track, but everything else just sounds like ... well ... a bad aspiring local band, to be frank. The singing is often difficult to take -- I can take an off-key singer if his/her voice has other redeeming qualities, but ... this is pretty dubious. If you're the type of person who REALLY likes listening to your friends' bands play in their garages', then you might want to check this out. Others beware."
5,Top music. Grotesque movie,"Many years ago during a heavy rain afternoon in Madrid, the best thing to do was to enter to a cinema. The one nearby presented ""Che!"" and it was hilarious to see Jack Palance playing the role of Fidel Castro, as well as the actor (don't even remember his name) who played as Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara. The movie is simply and totally grotesque and it constitutes an insult to the only authentic revolution ocurred in Latin America during the last century (the Mexican included). On the sunny side of the street, is the music: Schifrin shows he is a master of composition. He truly feels what he was doing and capts both the Andean and Cuban sounds with respect and dignity. Don't miss this record."
5,service review,"First, the cd is great. Second the individual I purchased it from provided great service. Received it on schedule and wrapped. I have purchased ""new"" cd's that have been unwrapped. Not much I can say. Price was right and service was great. I have been purchasing all of my cd's on Amazon now because of their prices. Probably, I have purchase 20 in last 2 months."
2,"Fell short, doesn't develop","I agree the flavor is there. I agree the cast brought together on this effort are genu-wine! However, each song seems to be burdened by a redundancy and menotony that disappoints. Admittedly, after ""Thunder Chicken,"" which I enjoy greatly, my expectations were perhaps too high. ""Do Your Thing"" does not get there for me, nor for my crew. Will continue to listen and hopefully that which has taken purchase with others will also be drawn upon me and mine. Keep trying, Papa Mail. Dig your style and art, but this offering has yet to compel."
3,There's A New Edition,"I waited for more than three months while Amazon kept telling me that they would ship this title soon. Finally, I shelled out fourteen bucks for a used copy just before discovering that there is a new, second edition, revised by the author Christy Karras. So, if you want this title, don't mess with this one. Search Amazon for the new author and buy the up to date issue. I hope this was helpful."
4,Visiting Utah,Good book- Planning to go to Utah for honeymoon-possibly Arches and Canyonlands or Escalante I need to decide though where I am going first before I buy the book-Wish that I could've seen more of the North Rim of the Grand Canyon-too bad there was a fire in progress
3,Good,"If you are looking for books about what life is like on the border, this is a good one. Written in an engaging style, it tells the story of a group of teenagers, most of whom are gang members (although, the book certainly describes it more as a family), and are habitual drug users (especially, inhaling paint fumes). Most interesting for me is that most of these teenagers have family that is nearby, or otherwise accessible. The author even takes some on trips to their homes; however, few of them choose to stay with their families. It seems, despite the lack of future in the Barrio, it is the family they prefer. The children, who we might suppose are innocent victims, are also depicted as the criminals, robbing entrants in the tunnel of everything they own. This book provides a very different context to the places than the one I and so many living on the American side of the border know and understand."
2,What a snoozefest.,"After reading the reviews here, I thought this book might be a nice inspirational read. It has a few decent moments, but for the most part I could barely force myself to keep reading. I got through about 75% of it, then just had to skim the last few chapters because I couldn't take it anymore. I dunno--if you play in a symphony orchestra, you're into reading sappy and/or narcissistic little personal tales, or you just have to read every single inspirational book that gets published, you may like this. Not the worst book I've ever read, by a long shot, but not good enough to keep or recommend, so I'm giving it two stars."
4,A Melody for you Mind,Zander is a Guarantee and music and writing. Do not miss this incredible book about melodies we all must play with other adn especially with ourselves
4,Nothing New - But Great Stories,"As is said with most motivational books, there is nothing new in here. However, the Zanders have great stories and a different angle than most similar books which makes this one a book I recommend.The overriding message is to get out our own way so we can see emerging possiblities instead of staying in the downward spiral. I especially like Rule #6 - Don't take yourself so seriously.One final note: If you ever have the opportunity to see Benjamin Zander present, do not hesitate to buy tickets. He is fabulous in the front of the room!Karen L. Jett, CMA, author Grow Your People, Grow Your Business and creator of the Strategic Plan-ting(TM) Workshop."
4,Helpful tool,The book The Art of Possibility is becoming a helpful tool. This is a book that can be read again and again. Each chapter has suggestions on how to become more open in life to possibilities.
3,"some good advice, but does ramble too much",I go along with the reviewers who said it had some good advice but was too long and tough to finish. Got very boring by the end. The whole book could have been edited down into a nice tight 15 page essay.
2,An interesting read - but authors don't live what they preach,"I had to read this book for a course I took. I thought it was interesting although I didn't really feel like it spoke strongly to me. I also saw Ben deliver his presentation at a corporate retreat - entertaining for sure.However, I recently witnessed Mr. Zander and his wife's behavior towards another passenger in the first class cabin of an airline. They were rude, self centered and generally uninspiring. The book and the message have now lost all meaning to me."
5,Bibliophile,"This book really makes available new and powerful distinctions, with practices to back them up. Applicable into the corporate envireonment, into the personal domain - thouroughly uplifting, inspiring and downright practical. More than worth the time and money."
3,"Maybe I'm not in the right frame of mind, but it wasn't what I expected","The summary of this book... Life is neither good nor bad, it's what you make of it... Well, thank God this book is only 200 pages to come up with that conclusion. I wanted to love this book based on the reviews here and a recommendation I received elsewhere. Well, I will just say I was a bit disappointed. I hope you find more in the book should you choose to read it and maybe I will revisit this book down the road to see if it was just the wrong time in my life to tackle this one."
4,The Responsibility of Possibility,"The ""void"", the ""space"" is there to enable creations of our own. It empowers us as activists, achievers. The book hands us tools, methods that will empower us in terms of our conceptions and actions. It reminds us that we are not subject to them , on the contrary we are masters and rulers of our perceptions and actions. It lays out basic and strong methods to raise ourselves upon our pre-conceptions about ourselves, about the being around us and create new ones that will serve us, benefit us and transcend our limitations. It reminds us the continous universe of possibilities that await to be chosen and to be created by ""the creator"". But it also reminds us the responsibility of this massive universe of possibilities. Each possibility will be missed unless the actor realizes it, recognizes it, acknowledges it and finally creates his own conditions of being."
4,changing the way I think,"I found this book at a Goodwill store. After reading it, I know that it's previous owners never even opened it. It is a book that show you how to open yourself to all the things around, and changing the way you are in the world. It has both the artistic thinking and logical thinking. it was well balanced and full of get moving stories. the biggest problem in the book is that there are parts that are hard to understand and grasp on to. But i know in time i will grasp onto the ideas as i continue to expand my thinking. It's Obvious the owners never read it, because how could you give up on a book that shows you how to be an all around better person."
2,"basic,","I didn't get much out of this book, but it is an easy read. It is mostly a bunch of MBA 101 platitudes that won't challenge your thinking."
3,Tried to restart book 3 times,I read the first 100ish pages of this book and I had to put it down for some reason (can't remember). Since then I have tried to pick up the book at least 3 more times and I get through about 5 pages and put it back down. This seems to be a collection of stories and that's about it. If you are in the mood to read some postive stories then this is a good book. Otherwise it's a pass.
4,"Lessons Learned by Teachers, Too","On finishing the book and reflecting on the passages that I'd marked, I would have to admit that the musical anecdotes were less ""insight-filled"" to me as a reader. I felt a stronger connection with Roz's passages. Perhaps I wasn't open enough to those passages that spoke of musical selections with which I am unfamiliar. I did learn in reading it how little I know of an orchestra student's passions. As an academic teacher whose orchestral students were sometimes missing from class for extra music practices, I briefly felt an annoyance with Ben's admitted assumption that he had no realization of his student's other commitments. We as adults pull students in so many directions... we often forget that their own passions may differ with the expected compliance with mandated curriculum."
5,Best self-help book I've ever read,"I've read many books in the self-help/psychology genre. This has the most practical advice that I've ever read. It shows how a shift in looking at the context of the events in our lives, can open up possibilities for transforming ourselves and all the communities in which we have relationships. The credits in the book reference Landmark Education. Having participated in that education, I am happy to have a book which I can refer to as life unfolds in its various ways."
3,"Thought Provoking, lacking in application","I found the stories to reinforce the concepts very helpful in remembering the rules and they were thought provoking in good ways. I struggled with how to apply it effectivly in everyday life. I do think that it was a good read and enjoyed it, but wished I could have come away with more everyday uses."
1,"Now, let me tell you something about ME","I can only imagine spending time with this couple. Perhaps, say, meeting them at a dinner party. The conversation goes something like this:Rosamund: ""Tell me about yourself.""Guest: ""Well, I was born in Boston.""Rosamund: ""Now, put that in the context of ME.""Guest: ""Well, you live in the Boston area.""Rosamund: ""That's right. I've got my act together. In fact, I've got my act together more than anyone else in Boston.""Benjamin: ""Well, let's talk about me in Boston. I conduct kids orchestras.""Rosamund: ""That's right, that allows us to pronounce general platitudes about life, management, love, and self esteem.""Benjamin: ""You know, I wasn't always this perfect.""Rosamund: ""Benjamim, shut up. I asked our guest to put his comments in the context of ME.""This was one of the most useless and unbearable books I've ever read. I kept reading, to the bitter end, just to see if it stayed as bad as it started. It did.What a waste of paper and ink."
1,1970s Cult Jargon Fest,"Ugh. How much of this Werner Erhard inspired sludge will we have to endure before the whole disgusting mess either dissipates or compacts down into an easily disposed of loaf? Familiar to any cult-watcher, the buzz words spill freely here. They are words and concepts that can mean anything to anybody. Fuzzy, new-age pap which the authors unashamedly admit come from the culty, self-improvement seminar called Landmark Education which used to be Erhard's ""est.""Sad to say, many Landmark devotees are encouraged by their participation to ""create"" endless testimonials reflective of their own egos, swelled to megalomaniacal proportions by various psychological tricks and techniques, and the Landmark Corporation by proxy. ""Spreading the word"" is part and parcel of the whole trip. Keep a shovel handy."
5,Make it real...practice possibilities!,"What a fabulous life changing read!!! Inspirational in these times. A much needed perspective that can help anyone shift things in his/her life. If one is looking for an uplifting read, READ ON!"
5,Excellent - I think of the messages in this book every day,"I was fortunate to hear Ben Zander speak at a business conference in early March. The book captured the best of his 2-hour, frenetic, compelling, interactive, inspiring presentation and further fleshed out the major themes.Eight weeks later, I still think of his stories and messages every day.Zander and his wife strike just the right balance between philosophy and pragmatism. What makes him particularly credible is that he applies his messages in a very demanding environment - running a world-class all-volunteer orchestra for 30 years. He's more than just a positive thinker and his life hasn't always been about the art of possibility.On a tough day, I think of ""It's All Invented, ""Rule No. 6"" or ""BTFI - playing it the second way"" and simply recalling one of Zander's stories is enough to shift my perspective and approach.That's quite an accomplishment for a 200-page book."
1,Drivel,"I saw the Zanders speak and read their book. He is unbearably narcissistic. She seems thoughtful if a bit vague and trite. Unfortunately he runs the show. He is much like the seminar leader in Jim Carrey's film ""Yes Man."" The message of their talk and book is basically a version of ""Say yes to everything in life and the world will be your oyster."" As Jim Carrey finds out, no it won't. I would suggest that others not waste their $."
1,Unbelievable,"A complete rip-off from the Landmark Forum. Landmark has been teaching this for 22 years, and these people say that they developed it? Even the terms that they use come from Landmark - I guess their possibility was making money off of someone else's material. It worked!"
2,Not my favourite,"Had to read for uni, but really didn't enjoy it much. There are a couple of chapters that are interesting but I was glad to see the end of the book. It just seemed to ramble on too much."
1,Tragic,"Okay, so I read the reviews and listened to everyone's raving. All I can say is this album is TRAGIC! Absolutely TRAGIC. I have gotten many great albums from Amazon so I guess it was my time to get some trash. I wonder if I can get my money back. Next time I will stick with buying what I know and the listening stations."
1,Worthless and tasteless,"I am so sorry I bought this recording. A clerk in a store on Brighton Beach told me that it was some excellent techno, so I believed him and wasted $15 on this worthless record. Tasteless lyrics and unprofessional mixing are enough to give you a headache after 10 minutes of listening. Remixes at the end of the record are make otherwise terrible music even worse. Artists obviously made an attempt to clone the music of European stars, such as ""Masterboy"" or ""Mr. President"", rather than trying to come up with their own musical ideas. The album ends with a ballad, ""Best Friends"", which once again proves that the creators of the album lack one main quality, which is required from an artist to write good music - professionalism. Perhaps next time they should also invite a good designer to work on the cover as well. I want my $15 back, you plagiarsts!"
1,Absolutely pointless,"I have read about these guys that they have college degrees in accounting or something; so perhaps they are good accountants but they are not musicians. The most shocking part is the quality of the recording: was that disc recorded on a CD-Recorder in their father's garage? What musical instruments did they use, a kid's ""Casio""? Their simulation of rap is absolutely laughable, esepcially considering their hilarious russian accent. Trust me, don't buy this disc. If you're live in the US and you're into some good European dance, order some imports from Amazon.com; there's plenty of good stuff."
2,meh!,"My little one had showed and interest in books and reading at an early age, I bought this set after she learned all her letter sounds and basic sight words thinking it would be a fun easy way to learn to read more fluently. They are cute, but very weird with a broken up plot, and I don't know why but these books are very difficult for her. Plus I get a lot of ""why mommy"" about what is happening in the books, and really I don't know why a dog would be standing on a log in the fog in the middle of the river. We've had them for a few years and they have not helped her one bit. We've been taking out the Piggie and Elephant books from the library by Mo Willams and they helped her a lot more than this set ever did, and taught her 3 yr old sister to read!! I think because they have a fun plot with simple words that they WANT to read over and over and over again."
5,"Perfectly done, terrific way to help kids jump into reading","My kids' preschool teacher recommended this to me and now I rave about Nora Gaydos' ""Now I'm Reading"" level 1 and up series to other moms. Let me count the ways...1) I credit this series with getting my kids to read sooner than they would have.2) Stories are very short but engaging to little ones. They are very manageable for emerging readers and kids are so proud of themselves for having read ""a book"" when they are done.3) Drawings are delightful!4) Stickers that match the story characters add to the fun and motivation.5) Author truly refrains from trying to stuff more than one new learning concept in each book. So many people try to do intro phonics but can't help themselves from putting in advanced sight words and several new concepts at once."
2,you get what you pay for,"It turns on and displays a picture. I've been using it for a few months. As noted previously, if you get much off of center, the picture degrades drastically. This wouldn't be as much of a problem if the panel flipped down more. When it is down, it barely goes past ""straight down"". On other monitors I've seen, you can adjust them so they are actually facing down towards the passengers. I had to move this forward more than I would have liked to so passengers could see it (and it's just barely passable). Also, we have to limit the movies to ones that are already pretty bright (mostly animated stuff). You can't watch anything even remotely dark because of glare etc.It does work though and I will continue to use. Commutes are much quieter now and that's why I purchased it."
2,re-dic-u-las,"I am disabled and have to hire to install product on my vehicle so I called Amazon and gave them my info and they picked out the "" no Drill"" boards and mounting kit. Delivery was fast as usual and I called mechanic to install. The mount kit was wrong, even though Amazon insisted it was right. I called Westin to get correct kit and when I received it and called for install the 2nd time ( I had to pay for his time the first time with wrong kit) The instructions were the worst I ever encountered in 50 + years and the guy I hired had to drill 12 holes! And guessed where to put them , said he doubted they would stay on over the winter with slush frozen to them because the bracket kit and screws were inferior and the rubber like strips that go between the truck and body were impossible to install and were left off! Now I know why I see so many trucks with the brackets showing,the owners had the same trouble as we did, I ask every time I see Westin boards now."
5,Most Favoriate,"THIS IS MY ALL TIME FAVIORATE BOOK!! usually i hate books but omg this is the best book ever, well it has a lot to do with the fact that Ty Murray is my hero so i knew it was gunna be good from the start. if you like ty murray rodeos and many other famous rodeo cowboys this is the book for you. And this is coming from a person who absolutly hates books. Never has. but i would re read this book a million times over and over. Well just to sum it up I LOVED LOVED LOVED THE BOOK. it is a must read for all rodeo fans. great tribute to lane frost and ty murray (obvisously). well that sums it up. MUST READ."
2,Braggadocio,"When I was young and foolish and growing up in Wyoming I was on the rodeo circuit for a short while. The cowboys I met were tough but humble. Ty Murray is certainly not humble. If braggadocio is your thing, this is your book. If tough is chasing down female elk on snowmobiles and then riding them, Murray is one tough dude. Depsite what he claims, I don't think that is ""the cowboy way."" It was at this point in the book that I threw it in the garbage. Rather than buy this book, I suggest you send the money to some orgaization that protects wildlife from people like Ty Murray."
1,King of the Creeps,"Ty Murray's undeniable talent starts and ends with staying atop bucking animals. In his self-patronizing autobiography, this spoiled rodeo superstar proves to be a redneck in the worst sense of the word, not a ""cowboy"" as he claims. His description of the time he chased down the elk on a snowmobile and then rode the exhausted animal in the deep Colorado snow would have been a mature mea culpa had he not used the incident instead to lash out at the wildlife officer and the newspaper reporter for doing their jobs and exposing him as a creep in a cowboy hat."
5,Glad I read it!,"When I first saw the reviews for this book I shied away from it but then I decided to form my own opinion. I'm glad I did. Not only was it a look into his life but I also got a glimpse of other greats like Cody Lambert, Tuff Hedeman and Lane Frost. I don't believe he was bragging but saying things as they are. It's a very positve book and I had my teenage sons read it. He talks about living your dreams and doing your best. I think it's awesome he went to college and graduated cum laude. He has lived a most interesting and busy life. I don't know about ""King of the cowboys"" but he's most certaintly at the top the list."
2,"Palm VII -- Skip it, stay w/V or move up to the 500 series","I've had a Palm VII since about a month after they debuted -- about two years now. Compared with other handhelds, this one is horrible. It eats batteries like a digital camera. It can't use rechargeable batteries so you end up with a dying machine and a lot of lost dollars on batteries. Number two, the wireless is extremely limited. While the weather.com and driving directions apps are good, they aren't that powerful and you have to pay (...) to use the service. It's not worth it. Lastly, the design and packaging are ugly, heavy, and big. The case is plastic and it is 3x as thick as a Palm V and a little wider. All in all, this product should be skipped. The Palm V is much better and the new m500 series are leading-edge products."
4,Wireless Internet With Double The Menory...,"The new Palm VIIx handheld lets you access the best of the Internet, communicate via e-mail, and stay on top of your information wirelessly and easily. With 8 mb of memory, you can customize the Palm Vllx handheld with your choice of hundreds of web clipping applications and thousands of third-party add-on applications. Trade stocks; get quotes, news items, or sport scores; look up addresses, flight information, or weather forecasts; and send and receive e-mail virtually anywhere. With more web clipping applications and more memory, the Palm Vllx handheld gives you the best of the Internet, where and when you want it. Memory - 8 MB...Addresses - 10,000...Appointments - 8 Yrs...Memos - 1,000...E-Mails - 400...Battery Type - AAA...Battery Life (based on normal use) - 2-4 Weeks...Add-ons via serial port...Integrated wireless internet access...Display Backlit... The Best Of The Best For All Of You Electronics Nuts..."
3,forseeable future?,Why? Why a handheld of the caliber of the Palm VIIx wireless can't do a simple thing like put a plug-in for a earpiece and make it become a 2-way communicating device (commonly known as a phone?).
3,MS Outlook & GroupWise Sync Concerns,"The Palm Pilot VIIx is my first handheld computer. Even though I have not yet hooked up the wireless component, I love the little thing! Unfortunately, I spend too much time managing bugs in the application conduits. You see, I am not using the programs that came with the Palm Pilot. I am using MS Outlook for Contacts and GroupWise v5.5 for planning and scheduling.The two way synchronization has problems(duplicate entries, contact misfiling) plus the category managment is limited. I hope these issues can be resolved with new software or software upgrades. I don't mind purchases - but which one & will it work?For people who must use Outlook and/or GroupWise and cannot be bothered with similar problems, keep this review in mind."
4,"Great little thing, worth the money!","I reciently recieved my palm viix handheld and I love it. I had the palm vii but I upgraded when I heard that the palm viix had 8mb of memory. There were a lot of web clipping apps I wanted, but didn't have enough room for. Now I have almost all of them and I still can keep track of all my names, to-do's, memos, and all the ad-on applications which I have. The web clipping apps are free from palm.net, and there is also a lot of free software from palm.com. The palm viix has a better looking black outer case, and comes with its on case. I would highly recommend getting this palm instead of the normal palm vii. It is worth the extra ($). You will probably need the memory once you find out how useful the wireless applications are. My only complaints are that it doesn't work in Hawaii, or most of the central United States, since I do a lot of travelling. You should go to palm.net and find out if there is coverage in your area before you buy this."
2,I lost all my information instantly,"Ye,Ye,Ye nice toy, not for business though.1)It eats batery, and it is very very very hungry.2)I got rechurgable batteries for it, butyou can not regarge it through the Sync tool,every time you have to charge another set and manualy replace it.AND once you forgrot to do it in time ALL information is gone,Yes you can regulary back it up... but you can not trust to this thing any critical info...In my case I had to redo my workstation due to virus, andat same time Plams battery expires, so I lost it in both places...No I can't trust my information to this thing anymore.Go for the new once that have flash memory at least."
1,Better check before buying!,"You need to go to Palm's website and look for the ""Coverage Map"". I ordered this Palm VIIx and then checked it out on the website to find out that Palm.Net was not availible to me. What [garbage]. I'm glad I didn't get it. I bought the Palm IIIc which is color and phat as anything. Palm.Net is WAY to expensive too. Don't get stuck with this handheld and not be able to use the feature that makes it the bulkiest thing on one hand. You might be sorry."
4,"great for the price, expensive internet access","first, returned my handspring visor delux, because of the usb connection was unstable with my win 2k machine. decided to go with the wireless palm. the palm side, is great, it has a faster cpu then the handspring, and the updated palm os. the serial hotsync works every time. battery life is poor because of the fact it is always charging the transmitter. thus, if you never go on line. don't buy this model,the m105 or handspring delux with 8mb of mem is fine...the palm service is very expensive and not worth it at all.but as for the palm, it is great, and works fine"
2,Don't swoon too soon,"I was one of the first Palm VI owners and was very up beat about my new toy. But now that I have had it for a while, I discontinued my palm.net service as a waste of money. I recommend palm buyers get a non-Internet model and use the great organizer features. The Internet function is VERY slow and subject to poor reception or incomplete downloads. The cost of these downloads is very expensive if you use it enough to make it worth while. The range of material available for Internet download is very limited. And did I say SLOW? A web enabled cell phone would give you both the net and a phone -with cheaper monthly charges and you can both talk and surf with the same device. When you buy the Palm VII you must use palm.net and they are not well priced or customer oriented. A web enabled phone allows you to pick your provider and is always on for a stock alert or other quick message (unlike the palm)."
4,Palm IIIe upgrade,Nice unit; I do not use the internet feature. I bought it because you will never have to ship to factory to repairs for replacement of built-in batteries and it had 8mb of RAM. Plus I bought it for [price] from [local store] which included the Palm brand fold-out keyboard. Where else can you get the 8mb Palm with keyboard? Plus I use the keyboard with my IIIe.
1,Great Idea - poor exectution,This was my second palm. I live in NY Metro area and found coverage to be poor with very slow connection speeds. Just deactivated service to palm net - web enabled phone is much better and cheaper too.Take a pass on this one.
5,Amazing!,"A great accessible modern African artist. The songs are beautiful, the melodies haunting. He is also AMAZING in concert - go see him!!! A true genius ..."
5,Long time since I've read such a good one.,"The first time I saw the book and read what it was about, I just knew I had to buy it. I know you would say I just liked it because I love animals but there is much more to the book.The wolves are very much like humans in the book, each with its own personality and feelings toward the other wolves.It is also my first time that I have read one of William Horwood's books and I think, compared with other writers, he will end up on my TOP 10-list.Great book - a must read for everyone who loves animals."
1,Need More Info,"I've been scanning around amazon for a book on exactly this, telekinesis or mind over matter, i want a how to guide not case studies recorded by someone who wants only to prove it's exsistence. But I know better than to buy a book based on it's title alone. If the authour wants to sell a book on this topic, he or she seriously needs to send in a cover picture and a couple of pages like table of contents.I wish I knew, but I'm not buying it without something!"
5,My Teachers. My Friends,"Teachers have always held a special place in my heart, from my first teachers in nursery school till the present day. This book is great for those who have had a special teacher in their lives, teachers who have been mentors and friends. Get this book, and even better, share it with that special teacher."
4,More Soup Please!,I have never been disappointed with any of the Chicken Soup series. This is a wonderful gift for the teacher or teacher-to-be. Have given it as part of a graduation present to my niece and she was thrilled.
4,A few tear jerker stories,"Really not a modern view on teaching. Stories are from another century and another world! Of course with any chicken soup you cant go wrong, they always pick great stories, but this book is really not motivational for today's teaching. In fact in one story, if a teacher was to do what they did then today, they would get arrested."
5,Perfect!,"I bought this because my mom's a teacher and her birthday is coming up (so is the upcoming school year), so I thought I'd buy her something teacher-related. Once I found this, I was so excited to present this to my mom. Now, her birthday isn't for a few weeks, but this product was in great condition (no bent pages or anything) and it looked fabulous. Plus, I read some of the stories in it and they're so inspirational! This would be the perfect gift for any budding or bloomed teacher!"
2,Too much millet,"I purchased these suet cakes thinking they did not contain a large amount of millet seed as do the inexpensive cakes you can purchase at the big box stores. I didn't see millet listed in the description. On the cake wrapper it is listed as the second ingredient and once opened, you can see why. The label doesn't seem to say what kind of millet it is. White millet, in my experience, attracts pigeons and house sparrows. So far it has not been a hit with the woodpeckers in my backyard. I'm sorry to leave a negative review, but I do want to let others know what I found."
2,Not much better then the one I was replacing,"I ordered this battery from amazon hoping to save a few dollars from the overpriced Verizon batteries. Turns out I should have gone the extra mile and paid for the verizon battery. This one has just as much if not less battery life then the one I was replacing. It fits in the phone, but don't expect much for talk time, it's nothing like the original battery.shipping was good though."
4,Richmond's Richest Yet,"Pamela Richmond's novel, ""Good Night, Sweet Prince"" is a beautiful tale of a young adolescent who seems to live very much the lifestyle many of us could relate. The only difference is she experiences what many of us only dreamed of, to live next door to a famous rock star. But not only does she get to live next door to him, she also meets and befriends him. A dream come true! Richmond's prose and storytelling are exceptional and leaves the reader wanting more. This is why I only rated her a four (4). This reader would have preferred a longer story. This is only because when one reads excellent storytelling, s/he never wants the story to end. The best part about this book is anyone from any age group can pick up Richmond's book and read, understand, and enjoy it thoroughly for its content. This takes exceptional skill and Pamela Richmond certainly has that!"
1,I cannot see one redeeming quality of this book!,"It is not only poorly written, even confusing at times, but it lacks imagination and credibiliy.Yes,I KNOW it's supposed to be a fantasy, but it doesn't take the reader far enough to make that leap, and therefore falls through all the cracks. It also portrays the ""eccentric neighbor"" annoyingly, as we all know who it is supposed to be, and there is nothing credible there, either. I agree with ""Skeptic 505"" that if it were possible, I would rate this book with Zero stars...and don't waste your money."
1,Save your money on this one!,"What do bad writers who write about the Rolling Stones have in common? They're generally living off of -- or, more appropriately, under -- a dead Rolling Stone.So it is with this book, ""Good Night, Sweet Prince,"" a ""novel"" about the late Brian Jones, founder of the Rolling Stones.The writing lacks imagination, characterization, narrative structure and proper use of the English language (syntax and grammar).Why are so many people feeling the need to make a living off Brian, who's been dead over 30 years? Why do said writers treat Brian as if he were somehow their private property? Answer: Because, as Mick Jagger says, these people are just trying to make a name for themselves.If I could, I would give this book 0 or fewer (-10 or more) stars. Save your money."
2,very small. can barely fit a child's school snack. nice looking.,"good looking bag, that's about it. Just barely can fit a child's school snack."
1,Very low quality suet,"Even though it's labeled ""Peanut"" suet, ""Peanuts"" are the third ingredient after cracked corn. It's low quality stuff. I'm returning my order unopened. I'm also returning the ""High Energy Suet"", which is the same low quality.Dan."
5,Easy ...set up,I had to replace an opener that used the Large Watch batteries.... Horriblecould not find replacement anywhere.This uses the standard 9 volt.So I keep a spare in the car....if and when it goes out and I'm locked out.Works fabulous ...no issues 4 months later.
2,Disappointed,"After using this toaster for a couple of months, I am already in the market for a new one. This thing drives me crazy. It toasts inconsistently, and dreadfully slowly. It doesn't elevate smaller items high enough to get them out without using a utensil. My English muffin gets lost every morning. The toast opening has a rim and everything catches on it. Great for toasting huge bagels, but not wide enough for large bread-- you have to stand it on end. Ugh. This toaster will do if you want something cheap and you don't use it every day. If you need something for everyday use, this one will drive you nuts. Mine is on the way to the Goodwill as soon as I find a replacement."
2,DON'T BOTHER,"I purchased this toaster with low expections because of the low cost. I am still disappointed. The toaster does not cook evenly and it is a surprise everytime whether you will get dried out bread over overly toasted bread. Sorry, this wasn't even worth the $20.00. I need to replace it as it is driving my family nuts."
4,Proctor Silex Toaster,"Unfortunately, I cannot review the toaster since it was purchased as a gift for someone else; however, the transaction with Amazon was good, as usual. :)"
5,Great for the Price,"This is a great 4 slice toaster for the price. No need to spend lots of money. My husband and I had a Proctor Silex 2 slice toaster for a bunch of years and I finally had to retire it, even though it still works great, in order to have breakfast at the same time on the weekends. Buy with confidence."
4,"Good, simple toaster",This toaster replaces a toaster oven that took forever to toast and then did an uneven job. The Proctor Silex is not real fast but does a nice job of evenly toasting bread. I'd give it 5 stars if it was easier to retrieve small pieces of toast from the slots. Those require fire-proof fingers or real small tongs to get out.
2,Broken already,Got this one to replace a toaster oven with nothing wrong and tossed the oven and then this one didn't stay down in less than six months. Going back to a toaster oven. More versatility.
2,Cheap looking,"Well as my review title states this toaster is not too nice looking. Price is low and so is the quality. Just does not look like the newer nicer looking toasters. I found it difficult to get bread out even with the push up extender. To make things worse, the two slots on the left stopped working after one week. I am sending back for a refund. Amazon is great about returns. No shipping costs. Anyway, My wife was upset that I ordered such a cheap looking toaster. So now I will let her get whatever she wants."
2,Uneven toasting lifter no higher than old toaster,I am very disappointed with this toaster. It toasts very unevenly - one side of the bread much darker than the other and in one slot one bottom corner doesn't toast at all. I thought the lifter was a great idea but the toast comes up not as far as in my old toaster and when I use the lifter it only lifts it as high as the old one did. It's not really a lifter at all.
4,Good enough toaster,We bought this because it has 4 slots and it has a raise-up feature to lift up the toast when it's done. It doesn't raise up very high and it won't raise up at all if the waffle is tipped enough to one side to get bumped in the way so you have to tip the waffle to where it's more upright so that it could be raised up. We love the red buttons! The red buttons light up on each side that is being used for toasting so that you know something is inside being toasted. That's not the only sign though because the red hot burners are glowing brightly red so you know it's toasting. What makes the red buttons a great feature is that they also function as a cancel button - press the red button and the toasting immediately stops and the toast pops up. Great feature! We would buy this toaster again because we can't see spending a lot of money on a toaster even though we use it almost daily.
4,toaster,I am not thrilled nor am I disappointed with this product - it's a toaster. It takes a long time to toast but the settings really do mean something. The slots are wide enough for bagels too.
2,not great,"i bought this toaster after reading the amazon reviews. however, i am returning it after trying it out. the main problem is that the piece that supports the bread is very thin. so if you are toasting something narrow, like a frozen waffle, it can slide down below the support, and then you have to unplug the toaster and fish it out with a fork."
2,Not a winner,"Bought this toaster largely on the Consumer Reports/reviews here and sure wish I hadn't. Two reasons: one, the slots are very short, only about 5 1/4 inches. I bake all the bread for our family using 5 inch wide pans, and because I get good volume, I have to trim off the side edges to get a slice into the slot. This is a pain. I suppose I could rewrite all my recipes for smaller pans, or buy my bread at the supermarket, but why should I? Second problem: at the darkest setting the toast comes out slightly tanned, not brown. I could run it through the toaster again, but again, why should I? I shouldn't have to change my whole life to suit my toaster. My old toaster, a Hamilton Beach, had nice 6 inch slots and produced lovely toast (from my same homemade bread) at a medium setting. It lasted more than two years, too, which is about a year longer than any other toaster I've bought in the last 20 years. I'm buying another Hamilton Beach and marking the Proctor-Silex ""opened by mistake,"""
3,Slots are not long enough,"I was looking forward to replacing my old toaster, which takes too long to produce toast. I was very disappointed in this toaster. The first thing I tried to toast - a relatively small slice of oval marble rye - was too long to fit in the toaster. Unless you only toast round or square things, like bagels and white bread, you are going to have to cut off the end of the bread. I'm going to go back to a toaster that has two extra long slots."
4,Good toaster- Good Price,"Perfectly adequate toaster at a good price. Toasts evenly and well, although a little slowly. Great value."
2,Not so good.,"We had this toaster just 2 months. While toasting an english muffin, one side of the toaster coils just quit working. The overall looks and features are great. I think we got the lemon in the bunch."
5,swith de ignition for neon 1998 standar,muy buen producto excelente lo recomiendo es de muy buena calidad lo monte a un neon chrysler 1998 sincronico de calidad lo recomiendo
2,variable quality,"I think the CD I received from Amazon a few weeks ago is the same as the one I am reviewing. My CD is called ""The Tenors"" and features Pavarotti, Domingo and Carreras. The recordings of Domingo and Carreras were of good quality, but not so for those of Pavarotti. The sound was extremely variable and some portions were barely audible. Some of Pavarotti's selections included female vocalists, but no credits were given. Overall, I was disappointed in the CD."
5,My favorite show!,"This show is like an adult Sesame Street... it's an educational show disguised as entertainment! Penn and Teller make their attacks on a wide variety of controversial subjects with stunning ferocity and a razor sharp wit.A couple of previous reviews attack the episode ""Environmental hysteria"" based on the use of Bjorn Lomborg as a reference. I wouldn't throw out the whole episode just because of that though. Lomborg isn't a scientist, he studies numbers. In fact, the main argument against Lomborg is that his sources of data are scientifically inconsistent. Penn actually states that the information is inconclusive, that we're still gathering info! If you watch the show they aren't attacking environmentalism, they are attacking the fanatic hysteria that lobby groups use.This is the beauty of the show, it stimulates your grey matter!"
5,Excellent Information,"Penn and Teller hosting an informational no-bull television show, is like Siegfried and Roy hosting a Dr. Phil type show. These two performers are able to pull this off though, and near-flawlessly at that. They fully explain both sides of the argument that they are discussing, pick the most realistic side, and fully exploit the other, incorrect and inate side. Episodes such as ""Environmentalists"" truly acknowledge its great informational facilities. This is truly a good buy if you are a fan of the show, if you like Penn & Teller, or if you are a realist in this sugar coated world."
4,Second Season is Actually Better,"This intentionally incendiary effort succeeds in stirring thought and being really amusing.It does not do quite so well in massing logical, well-researched argument to support some of the contentions put forward. Honestly, if that's why you'd buy these DVDs, then pass this set up and get the second season instead.The second season hits this series stride in full effect. The intelligence and research catches up with the entertainment, and the result is palpably stronger.But this first season is still strong and very, very watchable. Hey, these guys are talented entertainers, and they use that talent to the max here..."
5,Excellent!,"Penn & Teller debunk modern society hype etc in these DVD's, and you will laugh your arse off as well."
5,review,"You have no heart or soul if you don't like this show. It's hilarious and educational at the same time. I can understand some people not liking the name of the show, but come on. For some reason, Penn Jillette reminds me of a doorknob."
4,I agree with 90%,Very good dvd set. I love the premise but like all other opinions that others have I can not agree with 100% of what the call BS to be actual BS. All in all a great buy.
4,Exposing the hypocrisies of the Left and Right extremists,"I thought this was a much-needed DVD. While Penn Jillette, is not the most persuasive orator nor a very funny stand-up comedian, the investigative journalism they put forth in a right-winged-Michael Moore fashion, is quite exciting. The way they show the hypocrisy of environmental groups like Greenpeace and PETA is superb. Their libertarian outlook on the War on Drugs is a must-see.People on the far Left will hate this and they will be very dissapointed in Penn and Teller. However, they need to see it. In this day and age, where there are so many young people believing ridiculous things and becoming passionate about illogical nonsense, a show like this is important.I still say that Penn and Teller do a better magic show. But, I commend them for their effort here as it is much needed in the world today."
4,How True!,"Penn & Teller really investigate modern frauds with flair. It's enjoyable to watch, although the language can get fairly vulgar at times. I'd recommend it to any adult who isn't too easily offended."
1,Wouldn't play,"For some reason, none of these Penn and Teller DVDs would play in my DVD player, including this set. My DVD player is fairly new, and this is the only DVD that has ever not played in it. I sent them back, but have not recieved any indication that you have recieved them."
4,Penn & Teller - not just for fun,"Parts of this DVD is used in my various college courses to promote critical thinking. It could be considered vulgar but Penn and Teller ask you to challenge your everyday beliefs and your reliance on experts and facts, and yep, it's entertaining."
2,Entertaining but not authoritative,"The two stars are for the entertainment value of this series. There's no doubt that Penn and Teller can put on a show. However, this series proves very little. They employ the same techniques they blast as B.S. to make their points: questionable ""experts"", misdirection, and even petty name calling. I have no doubt that most of the things they investigate really are B.S., but to say that Penn and Teller ""prove"" them wrong is stretching it. If you want to have a good laugh and see some wonderfully pathetic examples of human gullibility, watch this series. If you want to see well thought-out, unbiased skepticism, this isn't it."
1,hated it,"I own other versions which were far more entertaining. The changes were for realism, I guess, but frankly it made the game irritating. Buy an older version."
1,How To Kick,"Obviously, this isn't really a review, but my brother is having a really hard time figuring out how to kick the ball in season mode. We read the directions, did what it said, and still nothing. He said he can kick the ball in a ""pick-up"" game, just not in a season game. So..... if anyone knows how to kick the ball in season mode, PLEASE tell!!!!"
4,Can take you from a frozen standstill to a heavy jog in 1 wk,"So many great exercises and techniques to help people focus and find what they want to do. Once focused, there are helpful guides to getting interviews, writing resumes, turning interviews into offers, and then negotiating the offers. Above all, however, it really helped to lay out long term goals. My next step doesn't have to be the ""dream job"", it just needs to get me closer to my long term goals. Frankly, I am not prepared for my long term goals yet - but at least now I have them!"
5,Shimmering Brilliance,"We think that we can think about anything, that we have such immutably correct reasoning, that we can craft impervious arguments with epistemic power. However, we forget that this is merely a biological, mental process. There are humans that exist without such reasoning capabilities. Does this make them less valid as human beings?Animals can not reason. But they can feel. Does this make us superior?My point is that elitist intellectuals think that they know everything. They ration away the emotion of life, the very humanity of their being. With no feelings and no emotions, they numbly reason through life in cold, detached skepticism.Where is the spirituality? (Human, not religious.) Have we lost all capacity for empathy? For hope? For faith? (Again, not religious per se)Thinking is not complete without feeling."
3,Incomplete,"While this book does make a decent attempt to explore the questions it brings up, it fails to fully take into account the depth of the concepts and sources it uses to make its points."
4,Good value.,Cute little sweater....good fit and medium warm. Great for in the house on colder days or at night. My dog loves sweaters and this is a good one.
3,Okay,"The track ""Scottish Rite Temple Song"" is great. Craig Ferguson's cover of the song on his show during their week in Scotland is better, though. Frankly, the rest of this CD isn't as cool as the first track.There's a general lack of production values, as well, which makes the voices hard to hear on some tracks. Still, you gotta admire the attitude."
4,A vintage reference AND jungle survival guide!,"This Viet-Nam era handbook is not only a how-to manual covering counterinsurgencyoperations in the JFK era of the conflicts in SE Asia -- but also includes basic tips onoutdoor survival with an emphasis on the Pacific Rim . Tips include construction of ajungle shelter and a bed, improvised fishing, how to make (and use) snares and traps,First Aid, knot tying, and how to use the sun to find the direction of North, among othertopics."
4,The North and the South are different worlds,"This book is a bit confusing in that it is a prequel which itself has a sequel, yet Colorado Gold is listed as book one...anyway, this introduces the reader to the underground railroad and those who have been changed from southern slave holders to abolitionists after hearing the truth and reading the Bible. I recognized several of the characters from Colorado Gold, and I am glad the author chose to go back and include some vital history."
2,Housw of the Flying Daggers,Not good. No real plot or story. I would like to see more of the plot or story. Could have been better.
5,Real and Sweet.,If you liked movies like The Watermelon Woman or Go Fish you will also like this movie. It was obviously low budget which I really like in movies I prefer rough edges to overproduced. The actors were realistic and believable (read: real lesbians that look like wimmin you know) and the story line was cute. I thought it was a great date movie. Not too deep... plot you can relate to.
2,Outdated book with some nice photos,"Out of publication for a reason. Wish I could find a good up to date book that had some real information in it. This is not it. I would put mine on the market, but I would feel guilty, and would have to deal with someone sending it back.The Mini Power Tool Handbook"
4,Good book for beginner,My daughter used this book to make a carving with her Drendel power tool and router stand. She said it was fairly easy to understand and the directions were very explicit and easy to follow.
2,Mini power tools,"If you're familiar with there big brothers, you likely won't glean much from this offering. I couldn't find much more information in the book than is usually available on the sales brochures."
1,"DO NOT BUY, DOESN'T HAVE MOUNTING BRACKETS","This is a waste of money. They don't have Mounting Brackets and nobody can make them for them. Do not waste your money. Sadly, we noticed too late to return."
5,In His Steps/What Would Jesus Do?,"In His Steps by Charles Sheldon is an excellent book and has challenged me in my own Christian walk. It is a fictional story about a minister and a church who come to grips with the reality that they have lost sight of what following Jesus truly means when a homeless person comes into their mists. Several people take a pledge to not make any decisions without first asking ""What would Jesus do?"" in my position regardless of the consequences. The story then follows the lives of those who make the pledge. What Would Jesus Do?, co-authored by Charles Sheldon's great grandson, Garrett Sheldon,is a more modern version of In His Steps. I would highly recommend either book...probably the modern version would appeal to and be more easily related to by younger people. We are currently reading the modern version to our youth group...a chapter a week. With this 2 in 1 book, you can read either version or both."
1,Great Book-poor publication quality of this one,"IN HIS STEPS has been such an inspiration to me for years, and I like to give it as a gift. It is getting difficult to find copies in local bookstores so I was delighted to see that Amazon had the title. The particular version I ordered was very poor quality with many typesetting errors in the first two dozen or so pages which is much too distracting when trying to absorb this wonderful message. I suggest selecting one of the higher priced versions which should solve this problem. I will continue getting copies of the title when I can find them, though. I try to read it every few years and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to know where the WWJD phrase started and to challenge him/herself."
2,I should have researched this before I bought it - So here's a tip for the next billy goat over the bridge,"Just get some blackstrap molasses.This is a molasses based fertilizer. The npk rating of the product received was actually 1-0-6, not 2-0.1-6 which may have been the sellers fault (try to pinpoint the npk of this stuff over time, biobizz seems to change the rating a lot). molasses has an average of 1-0-5 + iron and other micronutes - biobizz bio-grow lists only lists the nitrogen and potassium."
1,"Who is Shawn ""Lov"", and what does he mean to hip-hop?","I honestly have not read this book. Perhaps my only reason to pick it up would be to laugh. As far as I know, Livernoche grew up in the lap of suburbia listening to Blink-182. Its in his profile, if you'd like to check it out. I'm pretty sure the Abercrombie & Fitch clothes that he ""continually rocks"" negate any kind of street credibility he may aspire to. And I have heard his music. I have heard better stuff out of MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice. I would make other comments, but I'm afraid that his thug friends Muffy, Buffy, and Biff might jump me outside of Starbucks on their skateboards."
3,Great book to use in college organizational behavior classes,"I use this book in my organizational behavior class called ""Task Group Dynamics."" The stark contrast between leadership styles, use of power, ethics, and motivational tactics between the Federation crew and the Klingon crews make it a great vehicle for application of organizational behavior concepts. It's a brief enough book that students don't object too much, even if they don't particularly appreciate science fiction. I find it useful to recommend seeing the first Star Trek movie if they are unfamiliar with the characters."
3,Mediocre at best.,"This book is tolerably well-written, and I can't really say that the characters are badly handled. But the plot is not really very interesting, (a study in how the conflict between the Federation and the Klingons played out under the Organian Peace Treaty -- basically, the Klingons are reduced to behaving like unruly children on the schoolyard, trying to goad their opponents into attacking first, so that they can get them in trouble with the teachers, or in this case, the Organians).If you're one of those fans of the Klingons who absolutely must read anything that allegedly illuminates the alleged working of the alleged Klingon mind, then this is a must. Otherewise, it's definitely a mid-range Star Trek book; better than many, but not at all high on the list of Star Trek books to read."
2,"Terrible Documentation, Inaccurate Feature List","This device has some serious problems. First, the manual is poorly written, and second it lies about the features it has! It says it is a direct MP3 encoder, but it isn't. It records into another format that you can convert on your PC into an MP3 with the included software. You can't even listen to the files without hooking it up to a PC, uploading, and then converting.Be warned. This product is not very good."
4,Holmes takes some unusual twists,"This book is split into 3 sections: Believable, Long Shot, and Other Detectives. (I know I messed up on the section names but that's the closest I can get.) Most of the stories are just plain good. There are a few truly awful ones like the one by ""Jack Kerouac"" and the wine merchant one, but then there are some that make up for bombs (the cripple parade and the giant rat of Sumatra.) Not for the purist Sherlockian but really fun for the rest of us. I would've given it 5 stars but I'm saving that rating for the best Sherlock Holmes book I read. (Still looking.)"
3,"Some good, some brilliant, and one or two utter stinkers","This is an interesting concept and on the whole it has been executed very well. I note a fellow reader didn't like the ""Vamberry"" story, but to me it captured Thorne Smith perfectly. But a whole star penalty for a truly execrable pastiche, alleged to be Wodehousian in style, by Roberta Rogow. This is possibly the worst thing I have ever read, by someone who appears to be completely unfamiliar with Wodehouse and no great shakes on Holmes. On the whole this book is great fun and worth adding to your collection. But don't allow Ms Rogow to insult your intelligence and just skip over her frankly embarrassing effort."
4,Patchily excellent,"Sherlock Holmes fans will thoroughly enjoy this volume though may fall short of loving it. Readers who enjoy the genre should find it a damn good read, all the better for being enumcumbered with a dedication to Holmesian ideals. A couple of the stories are, dare I say it, indifferently written but on the whole, a fine book and good value at Amazon's price."
5,By far the best available!,"After my little dog Mandy fell off the cheap plastic steps I got at the local pet store she was scared to go near any steps. She took to these right away because the steps are wide, individual steps are short in height, and the sides are enclosed. They are made well, sturdy, and the carpet makes her sure footed. These steps gave her back the confidence she needed to run up and down them with ease. Shipping was immediate and I received it in just a few days, exactly as ordered. I recommend these to anyone who truly cares about their dog's safety. Very satisfied!"
1,bored? not really !,"i frankly did not catch much about boredom from the book. he was busy as can be from the time he stepped thru the prison doors! somehow, i was looking for more experience with being bored and rather surprized at the title.perhaps it was his own definition of the word that he seemed to experience ? i guess i was looking for silences and how they effected the writer. prison of course can be truly boring but i seemed to see days when he was writing, being ordered about, learning about others and their pasts. so, on a scale of ten i give him a 2."
1,"No credibility, insufficient supporting","I found this book atrocious. It consists of a few pages (<10) per alleged conspiracy, most of which is vague, unverified, unfulfilling and, at best, slightly informative. Each section is a repackaging of prior speculations, which the authors do not investigate, and to which they add little insight.Some of it is outright discredited (e.g., the fictional invisible ship!) and some of it is outdated (e.g., the latest Roswell declassifications are not mentioned).The authors method is to merely repeat others' comments regardless of whether they are reliable, and pass them off without chalenge. Hence, the book does not impart much real knowledge to the reader, even though it seems like it was meant to.Also, there was little citation, and most of it is old. Looks like the authors did not update the 70 or 60 that were in the original. shoddy!"
5,The best overview of the conspiracy mindset out there,"I started reading this book back when it was only 50 conspiracy theories and a 4 second appearance on The X Files pretty much sold out the first printing in 3 days. The authors do a wonderful job of sorting through the wild eyed, feverish conspiracy writings and crafting excellent, detailed, knowledgeable overviews. They clearly approach each topic with a healthy degree of skepticism and humor. I mean some of these ideas are so freaky if you don't have a sense of humor, you'd want to beat some of these conspiracy idiots with a hardbound copy of the Illuminatus! trilogy. But they never let their skepticism get in the way of a good story, shall we say.I heartily recommend this book."
5,Barbie IS Classic...,"Starring Barbie in KING KONG is a great addition to the Pop Culture Series. I think this could be the start of something really big if she continues to 'star' in other Hollywood Classics. Her new facial mold/sculpt is quite interesting - the shocked or scared look has been achieved without making her look too ""shocked"" !The packaging/display is really great! Hope Mattel continues the trend with follow-ups like Bride of Frankenstein or a Dracula Flick or even Jane from the Tarzan Series! There were many heroines that Barbie would be perfect to portray!Kitty West could make a great role for Barbie too!Keep up the good work Mattel...those creative juices too!:)"
3,Warning!,"I have nothing against Flora Speer. I really like the way this book was written. I laughed, I cried, I sobbed after the battle at Ronceveaux Pass. She really draws her readers in, and that is a wonderful quality in any author. However, I DO NOT LIKE the ending, and I didn't agree with it at all. If you expect them to find each other at the end, somehow, well, DON'T. It doesn't happen that way and left me VERY disappointed at the end, and thus very upset because I had stayed up half the night to read the book. Try something else, if you like Flora Speer a lot."
2,Dissapointed,I expected this item to be more durable. It is very thin cardboard with a tongue depressor handle. If there was a full description of this item I would not have purchased it. The actual price of the item is inexpensive but add the shipping and it is a complete waste of money.
3,Let's be reasonable folks,"If you have no personal experience with the supernatural, do not bother posting about this book. This book deals with the supernatural."
1,A delightful look into the realm of growing insanity....,This book is great. It follows the doomed crusade of two sad men who try ridding the world of an ageless evil which their deranged minds can only see. Two thumbs up. (Do two thumbs look like horns? They must be satanic!)
2,"Interesting ideas, but very scattershot","It's a shame that this book had to be so big, and its excerpts so brief. McCaffery has chosen a good selection of postmodern SF, but the excerpts are too often just a couple pages long. The result is a book a mile wide and an inch deep: it touches on every aspect of postmodern SF without really explaining or clearing up anything at all.A good way to use this book might be to read through it, choose what strikes your fancy, then buy the complete books attached to those. But I'm afraid if you just read this book, your glimpses of this very exciting genre will be too fleeting for you to get a good picture of it as a whole.To his credit, McCaffery has chosen an excellent array of writers and subgenres, including many who I did not know were SF or who dealt with SF in ways I hadn't expected. I should also mention that the design of the book is fantastic."
3,A good resource for black and white ornament,"An interesting resource. The designs are primarily of logo like graphics, although they do not bear any business names. A ton of different professions and merchants are represented from agriculture to zithers. There are dozens of individual images, the last 28 pages of the book contain full page layouts using various graphics from the previous pages, all of the text in the full page layouts are in German."
3,A mixed bag of new Holmes adventures.,"It's always nice to see new material devoted to history's greatest detective. Some of the contributions in this new collection are really pretty good. The structure of the book is also ingenious, with the stories presented in ""chronological"" order as if they were the results of true research. But about ten of the stories are a complete waste of time. I found myself thinking in several cases ""What was the point of that?"" It is also irritating to have Holmes linked to so many great historical figures of the period, so that, by the end of the book, there is hardly anyone famous whom Holmes has not met and the reader is tempted to play ""Spot the Star"". The editing needed a much firmer hand: for example, in one story, the name of Holmes's client is spelled three different ways on the same page, and careless mistakes mar some of the others too. But, on the whole, I had fun reading this book and it moved me to reread the originals - yet again!"
4,Above the usual,"This collection of short stories suffers from the usual problem with anthologies, uneven story quality. In this case the problem is not quite as drastic as usual. There are some very strong entries in this collection which will make for an enjoyable read for either the keen sherlockian or the novice."
3,Entertaining Mixed Bag,"This collection houses attempts to present and 'solve' many of the unchronicled cases alluded to by Doyle throughout his Holmesian Canon. The quality of the tales contained herein run from so-so to super; all in all, a pleasant return to the 19th Century haunts and habits of the original Dynamic Duo."
3,"Some get it right, while others...","Containing 26 Holmes pastiches from a variety of authors dealing with all different time periods in the character's history, this book is an interesting collection of some very good takes on the Holmes legacy along with some misfires. Like any anthology of this size, this one proved to be quite a mixture of clever takes on the legendary detective along with a few tales that will make you wince more than a little. I always find it fun to see how well some writers can capture such a well-established literary figure, getting the tone and setting correct while creating an intriguing mystery; while others just try to shoehorn Holmes into a totally inappropriate circumstance creating the written equivalent of a train wreck. Like any anthology of this magnitude, it all tends to balance with good and bad stories all making for a fun read when you're just looking for something a bit different."
5,Full of Culture!,"I'm Brazilian and I bought this book for my american family right before our first trip together. The culture info. is great. Just a little outdated on economy issues and also the pictures are old. But over all, is the best guide I ever found! I read it now for pleasure. Sandra Thurston"
3,Great Pictures!,"Although not as informative and detailed as ""A Rough Guide to Brazil,"" it does have some interesting pieces about certain Brazilian cities and culture."
4,"Beautiful country, Beautiful travel guide?","This guide has beautiful pictures, but little in the way of actual travel information. I'm a very visual person and love to see where I might go. If this sounds like you too, then buy this book. Add Lonely Planet's guide and you are all set to go."
1,This is junk!,"This suet is mostly millet and corn. It is VERY low quality. Do NOT buy it. I am returning it unopened.I'm also returning the ""Peanut"" suet which has the same low quality!Dan."
1,Not thrilled with this suet,"The birds in my yard apparently do not like these Stokes suet cakes as much as they like C&S suet cakes. I purchased a case of Stokes suet last February for the suet feeder outside my office window. The Stokes suet attracted fewer birds and the birds that did eat it (chickadees mostly) didn't stay for long, compared to when I use C&S suet which attracts more and a wider variety of birds that linger at the feeder. The red squirrels love Stokes suet and they ate most of it. I won't be buying Stokes suet again."
1,Starter did not work,"I ordered this starter after much research, reading their website and even calling the company to verify they were manufactured under strict QS-9000 guidelines. How can you argue with 100% new and 2 years of roadside assistance included with the purchase? Well, I paid a mechanic to put it on, and then got the call that it did not work. Having my car stuck up on his lift and needing to move on to other customers, he was not too please with our selection. I called the company's technical support and they said it does not normally happen that one of their starters doesn't work. I didn't have the time to send it back and wait for a new one, so I had to get another starter from a local parts store, which my mechanic installed it and it started perfectly! I returned the defective starter to Amazon and received a refund."
3,No hyperlinked recipe index,"This book is a rather wordy introduction to the various cuisines that can be found in the various cultures living in the Alps.Most of the time, the recipes are very simple, which is nice although it doesn't make this book very special, especially since there are no pictures.The annoying thing is that while there is a recipe index and an ingredient index, they are not hyperlinked. So using the book on a Kindle for cooking is not easy.Finally it must be said that the font for the book is beautiful :-)"
3,Meh.,Not what I was really expecting. Most of these recipes I could have printed online for free. Some of the recipes were redundant as well.
4,A Cook's Tour of the Alps,"The author introduces the cuisines of each region with a bit of history and an explanation of the topography. By understanding what can be grown/hunted, the evolution of the recipes makes sense.Perhaps the surprise of this book is that, the recipes' ingredients are not long lists and they are items generally found in any well-stocked supermarket, green grocery, cheese shop, fish monger, etc. The directions are well-written and easy to follow.My only dislike has nothing to do with the author nor the book. I simply don't like having cookbooks in Kindle format. Being able to quickly flip to an index, see color photos, and hold a hard cover cookbook is my preference. Some things just don't transition well with technology--at least not yet."
4,reciprocqting saw - good buy?,"The price was right, the saw was in excellent condition, but I think I was short changed because the saw came with only one battery. Not sure if this is the way it should have been delievered. If this is not the correct number of batteries that should come with this saw it should have been stated. This was misleading."
3,tool nice- batteries stink,"The tool works well, but even with XR batteries, i only get 3-4 minutes of run time. Buy a corded tool if you're going to use it over 3 minutes."
2,70% off my butt,ok i own this dewalt tool and it is pretty nice but the funny thing is i paid 104 with tax a few months ago at home depot. and the normal price is less than what they say 70 percent off is.
4,Dewalt Reconditioned reciprocating saw,Works great but the battery has 2006 production year (?)and the battery housing has a lot of scratches.
4,Works like a charm...,I have already worn out the blade cutting out some openings for gable & soffit vents around my 100 year old house. It only comes with one battery but fortunately I have two spares from my DeWalt hammer drill. Besides the crappy blade that comes with the saw the only other thing that can be seen as a down fall is that it is HEAVY. But then that weight helps to define the quality of the tool. I just have a little trouble sawing with one hand over my head while I hold on to the ladder with the other. As with my factory reconditioned DeWalt hammer drill I found both tools in good condition. A few cosmetic defects from previous use but function has been 100%!
1,Came with death battery,"Waste of money. Item came with completely death battery. When I put in charger red light was blinking fast, what mean replace batter. Also the dewalt brand name was sanded of from the side of the battery on the both sides. Don't waste your time and money to buy this crap. Sticker on the tool was said was remanufacture in mexico. BE AWARE OF THIS PRODUCT!!!"
1,"nice concept, but...","Maybe these work for some people, but I have MS and I can't reach around behind myself to secure them. Side closure would have worked better"
5,the joys of signing,"We got this video as a gift...it suggested having baby start watching at 6 months which we did (not thinking he was paying much attention)..to our surprise at around 9 months he started to (what we thought was just)imitate the kids on the video. Soon we realized he understood the signs and with our help was able to use them appropriately. By 12 months he knew all the signs on the first dvd and now at 18 months he is able to ""sign and say"" all the signs on both videos. He is able to sign just by you asking and he is tickled when we cheer him on!! this is truly a great video series..all of our family and friends are so impressed with his signing..others are getting BST for thier babies as well."
2,Pages falling out,"The description for this book said gently used. When I received it in the mail, there were several pages that were already falling out of the book. I can barely even read it to my children because I can't keep the book together. I guess I can't complain much since it was only a few dollars, but still. I was very disappointed."
5,Very powerful and evocative book,"As a junior high reading teacher, I am always looking for new books. Since I teach the Holocaust, I watch particularly for books by survivors which are suitable for 7-8 graders. This book is an excellent example of such a book. It is powerful and evocative without being harsh. Students will come away with a better understanding of this historical period. That it begins where The Diary of Anne Frank ends as well as about the camps where she also ended up makes it expecially moving. I strongly recommend it for all readers. Pamela Blevins"
5,Excellent Travel Guide,"If your doing these countries without touring agencies then this book is the best guide I have seen in a very long time. All the details of travel are contained within and Mr. Steves leaves nothing to chance in his in depth explaintations of your travel. We particularly enjoyed the insights of the different modes of transportation along with little tidbits of info on important yet not often thought of subjects such as how to get around once in country and advise on the different sites to see once arriving. We particularly liked his explaination of how to get to Murren, Switz and would use this as a good standard of which to judge the entire book. Thanks Rick for a very thorough and in depth guide to Germany, Switzerland and Austria of which we visited all three. You made our trip very enjoyable."
2,'Ultimate' is a gross overstatement!!,"I have tried two recipes from this book and liked the results of neither. The Asian Stir-Fry Stew was no substitute for a stir fried dish and a waste of good scallops. The Hearty Corn Chowder with Peas looked nothing like the accompanying photo and tasted so bad, that it went from the crock pot directly to the garbage disposal. The book has many beautiful illustrations but I am reluctant to waste good ingredients (and money) on a book that is long on promise, touting itself as the 'ultimate', but short on results. For people wanting to create a delicious meal with a short preparation time, 'Crock-It' is a better choice. For those of you who have the time to create more gourmet meals with your slow cooker, 'The Slow Cooker Ready and Waiting Cookbook'is an excellent resource."
2,"Beautiful Illustrations, Simple Recipes, BUT.........","I was very excited about dusting off my crock pot and simplifying my life! This is a beautifully illustrated cookbook that is nicely organized. The recipes are easy to follow. Unfortunately, the results are something else. The ""Country-style Chicken Stew Provencal"" had a great aroma but the chicken was overdone, the potatoes underdone, and the stew had far too much garlic to be palatable. The Portobello mushrooms turned everything a muddy color. I hope others have had more success with this very attractive cookbook."
3,Bought on a Clearance Rack,"I bought this cookbook locally and I got it very cheaply. It is worth that, but I would not buy it full price. It has some good recipies in it, but many that are either very invovled, call for obscure ingredients, or aren't appetizing at all. but there are some that are a little different, and a good variety of more up-to-date recipies for slow cooker meals."
3,Too much cooking before the crockpot even gets in the picture,"I got this book as a gift and after trying a few of the recipes not sure if I would have purchased it myself. Some of the recipes are pretty decent but I find that the majority of them call for cooking part of the ingredients before tossing them into the crockpot. On top of that some of them called for adding some ingredients hours later, then cooking some more. I don't know about the rest of you but my whole reasoning for getting a crockpot was just to toss in the ingredients and not give it a thought until dinnertime. When I want to get more involved in cooking then I'm using my stove not the slow cooker."
4,The Ultimate Slow Cooker Cookbook,Great book. This is my favorite cookbook and I give it as a gift whenever I know someone has a crockpot.
1,Somrtimes You Get Less Than You Pay For.,"A waste of money. There is a minimum of ZULU soundtrack, and it sounds as if it were taken off a fourth generation copy of a Blockbuster rental. The other tracks are equally bad. One could do better dubbing bits from old LPs onto Dad's Wollensack. If you want ZULU and good John Barry, go for the 2 disc box set."
5,Soft blue crystal,Beautiful crystal! It is of good size and sparkles nicely. It arrived in excellent condition and looks great in the window.
2,Too small and rough at the top,"This ball is definitely not as pretty as pictured.I purchased it for a gift, but would be embarrassedto give it to anyone! The top is rough (appears to beunfinished) and it is a disappointment."
5,VERY PRETTY!!!!!,WANT TO LIGHT UP YOUR ROOM WITH SUN AND THIS CRYSTAL? YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. I AM SO PLEASED. IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL. BLUE SPARKLIES!!! LOL
1,Defective. Not presentable as gift,"Beside the cutting does not has smooth finish, there are many small chips along the cutting near the hole on the top. Seller denies the fact the defect is from poor workmanship but blaming shipping and refused to refund."
2,chipped,Having opened the red one first I was a little disappointed as the blue had some chips and the hole to string it on was cut wrong and the string slipped through the hole.... It still looks pretty on my desk
5,The must have maritime law source!,"Have a maritime matter come across your desk? Where to begin research into a pesky and ancient area of rather arcane law? Schoenbaum is IT. Cites cases, statutes, and explains basic admiralty law very well, so that the admiralty virgin will have no problem figuring out why there is no jury, how a ship can be arrested, and what the heck general average is all about."
4,Happy as Can Be,"If you are doing any work in Admiralty and need an up to date authoritative source, this is it. Hell, even teh Supreme Court will sometimes cite this book for propositions of Admiralty and Maritime Law."
1,item lost,"i have not received this item yet and i cant track it either. What should i do?i have waited since july 28th, yet it never came to my place.Please help me"
2,Not really about plants from a Foraging Aspect,It's title is miss leading. It is more of a history book instead of what the indians actually used for cures and how they were used.
3,too advanced for young Boy Scouts,We were seeking a quick reference guide for a wilderness survival scout camporee. Book is for advanced students of outdoor living who have more than a passing interest in herbal medicinal uses.
1,Golden or gold plated?,"Interesting book. But keep it in perspective. This is the same person that financed the swift-boat ads and the new smears against Obama. I cannot take such a vicious, evil man seriously"
3,"Excellent idea and technology, medicore title.","This title is just good, not bad nor great. The ""Extra Smart Pages"" Star Wars title is great, light years better than this one. It is much more elaborate and complex. ""My School is Cool"" has various games and activities including identifying letters and musical instruments. It has a section that allows you to play musical instruments and arrange your own composition. Basic, but fun. This title would be good for those just learning to read and identify letters. The ""Smart Pages"" are just your basic ""press here, get a sound"" type books. The ""Extra Smart Pages"" are much better, pressing any given button will give you different sounds or variations depending on what you are doing at the time. Of the 4 I own, ""Anasthasia"" is the worst, ""My School is Cool"" is good, ""Hercules"" is very good, and ""Star Wars"" is excellent. Enjoy."
5,Welcome to the SMACK DVD's,"For those of you that don't know, SMACK DVD's have been around since 2003 being sold on the streets and online. You can find the old ones on Canal Street in NY. This one here is the first major-distributed DVD. This SMACK DVD is solid and does not disappoint. It is just like the old ones too, with all the interviews, street videos, and battle at the end. Everything on here is worth watching so go out and buy this now!!Note to reviewer below: UTP wasn't dissing Young Buck they were only talking about how he left the crew they even say ""You still my nigga but you was fake for that..."""
2,LTBROWN'S SMACK REVIEW,"I LOVED THE INTERVIEWS AND INSIGHT.THE ONLY THING I DISLIKED ABOUT IT WAS THE UTP SEGMENT WHERE THEY WERE DISSING YOUNG BUCK. THEY ARE FAMILY AND IT WAS JUST WRONG. I LOVE BOTH SIDES. I WILL NOT CHOSE. I JUST WON'T SUPPORT EITHER ONE, UNTIL THEY STOP THE MADNESS"
5,"Wonderful book for Rocky, Bullwinkle, Jay Ward fans","If you are a fan of Jay Ward and Bill Scott's zany animated creations, you really owe it to yourself to read this book. ""The Moose That Roared"" is filled with entertaining and enlightening quotes, observations, tales and all kinds of enjoyable information about the voice artists, writers, musicians and other folks responsible for these unforgettable programs. I can't imagine any author doing a better job at presenting the vast amount of material Keith Scott has compiled. In short, this is a terrific book."
4,NOW FOR SOMETHING THE HOPE YOU'LL REALLY LIKE!,"Great insider info about the team responsible for creating not only Bullwinkle and friends, but also George of the Jungle and even Cap'n Crunch. The author knows his stuff -- he's the voice behind the Bullwinkle movie that's being released later this summer.Fun, fun book with lots of pictures and drawings and other goodies!"
1,"Good topic, terrible read","In the hands of A.J. Liebling or Jane Kramer, this would have been an excellent book. After all, the subject is superb. But being a Red Sox fan doesn't make you a good hitter, and being a Jay Ward fan doesn't make you witty. Keith Scott has no literary style. The book has none of his subject's wit. It is as if a writer tried to describe Rembrandt by telling you where he bought his paints. The book should have been edited down by at least half. Watch Jay Ward's reruns; forget this boring book."
4,Love it!,I bought this for my child 3 month old child. He loves it! I like how you have the option to have nature sounds and music or just nature sounds. I just wish that it would stay on longer.
3,"Good, but Bright- I miss the old Ocean Aquarium!","I got this for my son because he enjoyed the other rainforest items. This was very nice, except the light was so bright that it lit up his entire room at night! Definitely not what I would use to soothe him to sleep.That being said, he loved watching the animals swing and the waterfall ""work"" I just wish the lights weren't so bright that I can't use it in the middle of the night. Whenever I turned it on he would squeeze his eyes shut and start to fidget to escape from the light!So, a mixed review from me- great for anything other than soothing him to sleep in the middle of the night!"
4,very nice but could use a better timer...,"We bought the Rainforest Peek-A-Boo when we were on vacation because we forgot to bring our usual soother. The Rainforest Peek-A-Boo is great. Our 5 month old is fascinated by it. The soother does its job in terms of helping him to sleep. However, the timer feature could be improved. Our son falls asleep better with the light and sound. Unfortunately the longer, 18 minute, setting is with sound only. Overall the Fisher-Price Rainforest is a very good product that I would recommend."
3,Stock up on batteries!,"This is a really cute crib soother. I love the characters, the music, the motion and the blue ""waterfall"". My daughter does calm down when she hears it go on. That said, I agree with the others that say the time the music plays is too short. The timer really should have several parent-set options(8, 12 or 15 minutes). My biggest complaint is that my daughter is only 6 weeks old and I have already needed to change the batteries twice! What's up with that?"
5,Bedtime lifesaver,My son started using this when he was about 2 months old and still uses it at both nap and bedtimes and he is now over 5 months old. I shudder to think of how we might have gotten along without it! The soother always grabs his attention and lulls him into sleeps. Both the music and the lights are fantastic. Occasionally I will press the button for a second round if he is really fighting his sleep but usually one hit does the trick. Before he was sleeping through the night when he would wake up in the early hours of the morning one round of the soother and replacing his pacifier always put him out again. Other reviewers have said that the light is too bright but my son often likes to look around at his crib etc. before he falls asleep so the light is just perfect because if it is too dark in the room he often cries longer. Overall I'd say that this item is a must have for any baby!
4,Great until water started to look rusty,"This was a great product and my baby who is now a toddler loved it. In fact, she still loves it but we recently noticed the water turning into a rust color. It lasted for two years though. Unfortunately, we decided to toss it since the water looked bad."
5,Rainforest Soother,I was actually referred by a friend to get this for my daughter. I am so glad I took her advice and got it. My daughter loves it. Great Product and forsure recommend it.
4,She loves it!!!,Should have a timer so you can choose how long it plays. My 1 month old watches it but cries when it turns off so i have to lay by her bed until she falls asleep so I can keep turning it back on. But it keeps her attention
3,"Doesn't do the trick, but still a nice toy","I bought this soother for my daughter when she was just a few months old. She is 10 months old now and she does like the toy, but it has never ""soothed"" her or made her fall asleep. She likes to watch it while laying in her crib and likes to bat at it. My biggest complaint is that this thing goes through batteries like crazy. Now I don't have the motion set, only the lights. If I have the motion set, it'll require a battery change every few weeks and it is a huge pain to get this thing off the crib once it's in place."
2,Already opened and scratched up,We received this for our son and it was totally scratched up and already opened. I'm assuming it was returned for the scratches already.
5,Enthralled from the first moment,Our baby has loved this from the time he was a newborn. He's 10 months now and still finds it fascinating. Very soothing.
3,Worked well,"It has a one button on for babys so they can do it themselves once they reach that age. It was a little bright and even a little loud on the quieter setting, but my son liked it and it had a long run time. The battery life was terrible, so maybe get rechargable or something. It did what it said and I kept it for my second baby."
2,Good but not usable for our crib,"Great imagery but be aware that this will not attach to all cribs. Ours has a wide rail and the attachment straps will not fit so we cannot use it at home, only at the daycare nursery. Sad because we could use it at home more. I wish the packaging would have stated limitations of attaching it to the crib because we would not have purchased this item."
4,Puts my nephew to sleep!,"Gorgeous item! The lights are bright enough to be really sparkly. The songs and sound effects, several lullabies. This is soothing, my 2month old niece likes it. I wish the timer could be adjustable...if I want just music and lights or both and the time. There's room for improvement, but still a great item."
5,Fantastic Crib Toy,Of all the toys my son has had this has lasted the longest (he is 2 now) and it is wonderful. It is the only toy that has made the switch to his big boy bed. This toy is very relaxing too so you have to be careful watching it.
4,Nice crib distractor,"This is a fantastic little crib distraction, I can leave my son in his crib now for almost 10 minutes! He loves to be held and be around me so yes that is the longest he will stay busy without someone in the room. I just wish it lasted longer, I think it is a great device, however if it could last about 15-20 minutes, that would be amazing! Definitely catches my 5 month old son's attention and keeps him enthralled for several minutes, though he looses interest, he will look around then come back to it, but generally it just doesn't last as long, which is the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Otherwise its a great buy for your baby. fun bubbles, and moving objects inside, with fun up beat music, not for sleeping! definitely for an awake babay as the light inside is pretty bright too."
2,Not what is says it is,"I bought this for my eight month old who was just starting to resist bedtime in hopes it would help. The first time we used it she was mesmerized and it worked like a charm. Second time it semi captured her attention with a little help from mommy. By the third time the moving frog had begun to squeak so that wasn't exactly ""soothing"" and my baby was bored with it. Gave it one more try just in case and the squeaking was still there. Needless to say I returned it. Also, the light was pretty bright. When I would first turn it on, my baby would squint from the light. And the timer is not 18 minutes! It's more like 5-6 minutes like other reviews said. Not worth the forty dollars in my opinion."
2,Fun for a while...,"My daughter has loved this soother for almost a year now, but we just discovered that it's been leaking. I thought that the water was evaporating, as the level was lower over the last month, but I discovered liquid dripping out last night. There are no breaks or cracks in the plastic; the liquid is coming from the seams. It doesn't smell like water (kind of plasticky), and, while I'd like to believe it's probably non-toxic, I'm still not going to leave the soother inside my daughter's crib."
2,Feh.,"I bought this with the hope that it would help my 5 month old fall asleep in his crib. Not so much. He does find it entertaining for a few minutes, but I haven't noticed any soothing occurring. I agree with another reviewer that the lights are WAY too bright if you're trying to put a baby to sleep (he's actually winced when I've turned it on in the darkened room), so I ended up covering it with a blanket to help dull it a little. And the monkey and frog squeak when they move so I have to turn that feature off too. And it doesn't stay on for as long as I thought it would (I chose this over another for that specific reason). So all in all, a waste of money. I'll keep it and maybe it will entertain him long enough for me to get in a quick shower, but for sleeping purposes it's a complete wash."
1,Fantastic and kids love it but LEAKS WATER!,"We have had this product for 2 years and 10 months now but only used it for our daughter for about 1 year. Once we had no use for it anymore, we packed it up in a box with stuffed animals and put it on the top of my daughters closet. Just last week, we pulled it out because baby #2 will be here late June only to discover all the stuffed animals wet and the soother leaking. We called Fisher Price and since ""it wasn't within the 1 year warranty for workmanship"" they did nothing for us. C'mon?! You just put it in a box for 2 years and it's going to break? Doesn't sound like quality to me..........They sent us $10 to make us happy but I told Fisher Price WE ARE NOT HAPPY. Obviously they know their product is shady if they send $10. Product was never dropped, misused, etc. They did go into labs reports about it being 98.4% water and certified non-toxic. It's ""gel-like"". Buyer beware."
2,Not realy a great product,I bought it for my nephew when he was 8 moths. It wasnt as productive I really wished I hadnt bought it. He only justed it once...The song is too short and it just wasnt useful for babies...
1,No batteries,"I bought this product and even though it says it comes with batteries on the packaging, it doesn't. I had to make a special trip out to get batteries."
1,item sucks,bought the item and didnt work well from the first day and now after one month it is not making any music and sound ..
3,Decent item.,"I have had one of these previously and it recently broke. With a crying baby I needed one quickly. I ordered this and it came in two business days. I am overall happy because now the baby is not crying as much, however the front of the machine seems like it has a blurry haze to it. I am not sure what or how that was caused but I know that is not normal because my old one did not have anything like that. I am disappointed with that but I do not want to return the item because I do not want to be without this machine for another few days or weeks."
4,baby loves it,"Very cute, nice tunes. Wish the lights had a dimmer setting though. Baby loves to watch so it so I'm not disappointed. The music is pleasing and I like the volume settings. Not too loud. I'm not having battery issues yet. It still has the original batteries it came with. I can see why it would burn through them very fast though. It has alot going on, with lights, music, bubbles, and multiple moving parts. Over all pleased with this purchase."
3,"Lights very bright, moving parts squeak","We have many of the Rainforest products, and this is the only one I've been unhappy with. After the first battery change, the swinging animals started squeaking every time we turned it on. The waterfall lights are way too bright -- it's fine for naptime/daytime use, but we don't turn it on at night b/c my daughter flinches away from the brightness and it just wakes her up instead of soothing her back to sleep."
4,Not soothing but great fun,"As others have said, the lights are quite bright. It became something of interest to my DD rather than a soother. When she was an infant, though, I could set it just to music, on low, while she fell asleep. By 7 or 8 mos she had figured out not only how to push the front button, but she would pull upon it and change the settings on the side. For a long time she could only slide the settings down, so she would end up turning the music to high, and turning the motion off - which annoyed her. But it served as great entertainment and a challenge to master all those settings, especially when she woke up before we did. A good buy, but not exactly for the reasons intended."
2,Not thrilled.,"I purchased this based on the fact the box/ packaging claimed 'up to 18 minutes of music"". Yep... music only, tho. The lights, movement and sounds, when the selector switches are set to play all together, will only go for 6 minutes. My daughter is mesmerized during those 6 minutes, tho, I admit. The problem is that it just begins to lull her into a doze before shutting off, and then she rouses, upset it has turned off. Mom then has to go tap the button to begin it again... This may be a great product for older babies who can tap the start button themselves, but for younger infants, I'd suggest one that plays longer or has a remote. I returned mine to the store I purchased it from and exchanged for a similar product with longer play and remote, made by another company."
2,So cute but has some problems,"I was a little apprehensive to buy another Fisher-Price crib toy since both mobiles we got had issues. However, this was so cute I couldn't resist. The lights and movement really do seem to mesmerize my little guy. Almost immediately the fish stopped bubbling and moving... not a big deal. But now it makes an incredibly loud chirping sound. It seems to be the motor. Customer service at Fisher Price is good... they always seem willing to replace defective products. However, we have to wait for them to send us a shipping label and then wait until they receive the defective one until they will ship out a new one. I think we'll try a different brand in the meantime..."
5,Love it!,My daughter has been enjoying this calming soother. The gentle lights and slow movement are just enough to hold her interest and sooth her to sleep before she realizes it.
4,Too Many Batteries,"I love the Peek a Boo waterfall soother. It has a wonderful time setting option from 6 minutes, 12 minutes or 18 minutes. My son just turned a year and he still loves it. The only problem I am having with it (and hopefully it's only me) is I am replacing the (Energizer or Duracell)batteries constantly. He's used it now for 9 months and in that time frame I have replaced the batteries 6 times. I think that's alittle much. But other wise it's a great toy and 9 months later still entertaining."
1,So far 3 did not work -- eats batteries,"Bought for my granddaughter, as my daughter said she was frustrated with the quality of the new Fisher-Price baby soothers. She was correct, got it home, opened it, changed batteries. Work inconsistently for 18 seconds, 4 minutes, 2 minutes. When music, action, and lights were on,,, it just died in a few seconds!!! Fisher-Price of today is not what it was in the past--quality is lacking! Will try Baby Einstein! Would give it a 0 if I could."
4,love this but it eats batteries...,i love this soother but it eats batteries like crazy. its so hard to put onto my crib that its a pain to keep taking it off to change the batteries.it is quite bright too....my son always squints at it....he also sometimes bumps it on in the middle of the night and cries until i turn it off.other then that its good. haha
4,Great Crib Toy!,"Just got the soother today. I had chosen it because a friend of mine had it and her son loved it. I think my son is going to love it just as much if not more. The music isn't annoying like some soothers can be and I love the nature sounds.Only issue I have with it is how it straps onto the crib. It is REALLY annoying and can be difficult. The use the straps to hold the soother in it's packaging so PLEASE follow the directions and DO NOT cut the straps. If you do, you won't be able to put it on the crib."
5,Trevor DVD,Saw this movie yrs ago on HBO. Loved it and finally found it here on Amazon. Quality of the movie is excellent. It was mailed and recieved quickly and in mint condition. Price was just what I expected.
3,Trevor,The movie made a good point. But it was only 30 min or so for this film. and not enought move time for the money I payed.
4,An insightful and witty short film.,"I saw Trevor in a film class at UCLA and it had everyone laughing hard. I loved the humorous approach it had to the taboo subject of homosexuality. To me, it was reminiscent of All in the Family's comedic presentation of difficult topics such as racism. Although the film was great, I still cannot give it 5 stars simply because I believe only a handful of films ever created deserve such reverence. It was entertaining and touching, nonetheless. And definitely worth viewing time and again. Enjoy."
4,Trevor,"This was truly a sweet movie. I wish that I would have had access to this movie when I was 13 and feeling that I was the only gay kid in the world. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, especially if you have kids that are struggling with these issues."
5,Perfect transaction,This was a perfect transaction. The seller quickly answered my questions and then quickly sent the item once I had made the purchase. I would recommend this seller.Thank you
5,Taking Time to Change,"If you've never used Changed Into His Image as a bible study, personally or for a church group, now is the time. This is not a gender-specific study, but it is equally as impacting for men or women (there's also a student version). The workbook, Taking Time to Change, is a great help in making it a weekly study with daily application. It may seem simple at first, but the straightforward style and repetitive order makes it a devotional habit more easily kept! Anything by Jim Berg is great. This is one of his very best."
1,A Piece of Junk,"I just received and immediately sent back my Onkyo TX-8222 receiver. I connected everything, plugged it in, and turned it on. After two seconds, it turned off. When I turned it on again, it crackeled and popped, then shut off. I went through this scenario about a dozen times. I called the Onkyo support line and waited on hold over 45 minutes before hanging up. In the troubleshooting section of the manual, it instructs the user to unplug the unit for an hour, then try again, when this happens. I did this twice, but the unit still would not remain on. I will try another brand."
4,good value,"Great value for the money. Great sound, lots of power. The only feature that needs improvement is the am/fm reception. I am going to need to buy an antenna."
5,Fabulous!!!,"The BEST small wattage reciever this side of $1,000.I use it everyday in my office at home. I have a second pair of speakers in my bedroom and I use the sleep timer every night to listen to spiritual material as I doze off."
5,"Review by Mazen I. Abbas, MPH","Public health practitioners have for many years advocated a well-balanced diet with proper servings of fruits, pasta, vegetables, etc. Most of the time, the public is not given any information on good tasting healthful meals. Dr. Abbas and Mrs. Holmin deliver a well-thought out book that has a combination of ethnic, healthy, and well-designed recipes. This book is a great experience that you will never forget and will use over and over. Try making Tabouli, or fatoush. You will never be wrong and it will always taste good."
1,"Navigation very poor ... Updated: Navigation worse than poor, pretty much unuseable","Rating is for Kindle Version ONLY!This rating applies to navigation only, which for a cookbook I find very important. There is no link between the book's index and the text. In places the book refers one to a specific page but the kindle software (on mac) provides no ability to find such a page.UPDATE: Since I wrote the above I've had time to read more of this cookbook. I would recommend the printed edition. The recipes seem authentic and sound good.However, if you wish to use the book for cooking I suggest that you DO NOT BUY THE KINDLE EDITION. It seem that one cannot return a kindle book so I'm feeling cheated by amazon.com's sloppy work. There are numerous references to specific pages that one cannot find except by going page by page (which is certainly not how I use a cookbook).UPDATE II: Seems I am going to get a refund. I'm no longer irritated, just disappointed."
4,Still Fun After All These Years,"I realize UO is dated, I played it when it first went live and left after getting disgusted with being PK'D every 10 minutes. I've tried a number of other online games and decided just last month to give UO a try again.It's bigger, better, and more fun than when I left it and let's face it, being PK'D is part of it, although it seems to happen a lot less now.The economy is complex, the charachter building process fun, and there's nothing like a good old dungeon crawl.Give it a shot."
1,he knows little,"on page 93 ..he writes ""Vande Velde was ordered to turn around, ride down hill to the support vehicle, and race back uphill to hand full water bottles off to Armstrong""...has this author even watched the TDF on tv...the whole book is fluff for couch potatoes and so naive as to cycle racing."
4,Track Listing,"For The Good TimesSylvia's MotherLovin' Her Was Easier (Than Anything I'll Ever Do Again)Me And Bobby McGeeDon't It Make You Want To Go HomeLeavin' On A Jet PlaneHello Darlin'That's How I Got To MemphisMrs. Jones, Your Daughter Cried All NightWoman You Have Been A Friend To MeI Took A Memory To LunchWhen Love Is GoneThe Year That Clayton Delaney DiedHelp Me Make It Through The Night"
4,A good movie that could be better.,"Peace Hotel was Chow Yun-Fat's last HK movie. It was fun to watch, but at times the movie seemed to lose its focus on the plot. But with an actor of Chow's caliber, the movie still works. The ending is incredible...Chow shows the viewer what a real man is...watch it and see what I mean."
5,A Fantastic collection for a modest price.,"Excellent tranfers, generous number of recordings (50) highlighting the Bowlly-Noble combination in both English and American recordings from 1930-1936. No liner notes, but for those wishing to have a nice collection this is the one to get."
5,THE BEST EVER.....,"....song of all time, by the very best ""crooner"" of all time and one of the best bands of all time, is featured on this release. That is ""The Very Thought of You"", have a listen then order the album. Another song not far behind is -""Love is the Sweetest Thing""."
3,Over Boston: Aerial Photographs - Needs a revision!,Pictures are almost historical they are so old (mid 80's at best)
4,Classic 60's stuff!,"The Four Tops second album is formulaic; you know, vibraphone laced motown pop, with a strident beat and vocals as sweeping as the strings. Definitely can hear some saxaphones enroaching there too. It may be formulaic, but it's a tried and true formula, and The Four Tops turn in one of their best albums.There are three recognisable hits, 'I can't help myself', 'Same old song' and (my personal favourite song on the album) 'There's something about you'. In fact, those first two are perennial favourites on the oldies radio. The other songs are, for the most part, not as good. However, they are all exciting, up-tempo songs, and are all of a fairly high standard.So, a highly recommended album as it is one of the most enjoyable ones by one of the best R&B; / pop groups. Rating is around 3 1/2 - 3 3/4, or 4 rounding up"
1,bad product,"This coil plug failed on July 19, 2011 after just 6 months. The mechanic said it looked like it came from a junk yard."
2,Poor sounding speach!,"I'm legally blind & use the talking calculators on a regular basis. I had one for several years, that looked just like this one. It was good & I was comfortable with it so, I bought this one, when mine gave out. I was VERY surprised to hear the sound on this one. It's TERRIBLE! It's very fast & the voice sounds like a childs voice. NOT good! Otherwise, it works ok."
3,Talking calculator,"Overall good product, however, memory is lost when power is cycled off and on. Most other calculators retain what is in memory when power is cycled."
4,Worked great for me.,"This product worked great for me. I bought it to drive my nailgun and it is certainly capable of that. Cycle up time is quick, and the noise is bearable...not much more than my shopvac. Shipping was expensive (new from amazon is only $50 more with shipping), but for what I use it for it is perfect."
5,Camcorder up and going for 06 Holiday Season,Our camcoder was not holding a charge. Did online search and found what we needed on Amazon. Placed the order and received quickly. Exact fit for our camcorder. Camcorder working fine now. Thanks.
3,Just the same as factory issued,"This battery is *equivalent* as the factory issued battery, thought I do not know if it from the same manufacturer. It lasts up to only an hour, so don't be fooled by the name or product description.Otherwise, it works just fine."
5,Genesis E-320,"What a very good BBQ. You know right away when you start putting this thing together that the parts are top quality. Cooks food even, and can use one or two or three burners. Fast heating. I start this thing up just for a quick Hot Dog for lunch, 10 minutes later I'm eating. 20 minutes later I'm putting the cover back on it. My Dad say's it's the Top of the line for Grills & I certainly do belive it. I did not think I would ever pay this much for a Grill but now that I have one I do not reqret it at all. I have not used the side burner, but when I do need it I'll be glad it's there. If your looking for quality this Grill cannot be beat."
1,E-320 Disapointment,"Quality grill,Looks nice,really not a good grill.2010 modelHeats up nicely 500 + degrees, but will barely sear a hot dog let alone a strip steakGood for slow cooking or baking.I called Weber, telling them of the issuehoping they may have received similar complaints and have a fix for the problem,their suggestion was to leave the food on longer, They suck!I have 2 friends with the same grill & the same & both aredissatisfied with the performance, same issue as meI noticed the 2011 model has a searing burner,Weber apparently realized the previous model that I havewould barley brown a burgerMy $150.00 grill from Target works betterthan this $800.00 P.O.S. dust collecting WeberI thought Weber had a good reputation and made quality products.They should recognize there is a problem with this first generation E320Today one of the casters broke, I think I moved the grill 5 times.\\"
3,damaged goods...,"It looks like a great BBQ, but it got fairly ""banged up"" during the shipping process. A couple of the iron parts are cracked but not broken. All in all it looks like a great grill and I look forward to using it. I would complain or return it but I had already put in 1-2 hours to assemble it and I was not going to re-start that process. Be sure to check ALL the parts before assembling. The lid has a nickle sized gash...Good looking BBQ all-in-all."
5,Best Affordable Grill,"I got this for Christmas, my family and I are extremely happy with it. You have to own it!!!! Add it to your wish list or be smart and buy it now!!!!"
5,Love the grill,"I received the Weber E-320 grill for a late father's day gift. It fairly easy to put together (about 3 hours). The only grip were the instructions, not enough detail. So be patient and go over the entire book first.Once together operation is great. Heats up quit and with the side burner the beans can be heated at the same time out side instead of running in and out of the house. Plus with the hurricanes in our area, when power goes out just fire up the grill and have dinner.Other pluses are the tank hanger that tells you how much you have left in the propane tank. And the removable drip pans for easy cleaning.I have had several different grills and they have all rusted out inside of 2 years.So far so good with this unit. I always recommend this grill to friends."
5,Bomb Grill,"This grill is great! Minor problem with a hole not being there in the grill box, called Weber up and they sent me a new one! Perfect! Great for steaks cooks nice an even with those professional grill line. A must have for a grilled food lover."
5,Like it (once assembled),Nice grill. Looks and works well. Took about 2 hours to assemble with mediocre instructions (images but scarce written instructions).
5,Another gem from Sarah!,"Sarah Shaber has captured an avid reader of her books in me! I couldn't put the book down! She's a real topnotch mystery writer! I love her main character, Professor Simon Shaw!"
3,Hardly a cozy but excellent mystery,As far as mysteries go this was an excellent book and kept my attention and I read it in a few hours. It's hardly a cozy and in no way reminded me of a cozy let alone Agatha Raisin and I found it fairly weak to make the bad guy a republican but all in all if you take this book as a mystery you won't be disappointed.
3,Out of date,"Not bad and a good resource from a respected author; however there have been some big moves forward in anchors in recent years, particularly in the small boat / cruising yacht area that this addresses.Anchor types such as Spade, Bulwagga, and Rocna have made the traditional plows, claws, and Danforth-types all but obsolete.A revision that devotes a chapter to these newer designs is badly needed. In the meantime be sure to take note of what is missing."
5,"Great book, tons of detail",I'm just getting started boating in the Pacific Northwest and I felt a lot more comfortable with anchoring after reading this book. Tremendous detail about the subject.
5,Every Small Boat Owner Should Read This!,"Why? Because you might be anchored next to me! Seriously, no other book describes the fundamentals of anchoring and mooring like this book. True, it lacks info on the latest trends in anchor design. But, as this book points out, your anchor is only one piece of your ground tackle and not even the piece that is most likely to fail when storm conditions develop. Some have recommended ""Happy Hooking"" as it is more up-to-date. Personally, I think that's it's only attribute over this one, and it contains little you can't find by searching on the web. Eric presents the known facts on anchoring clearly and in-depth. I have not found the level of treatment he gives all aspects of anchoring and mooring anywhere else. These are the tools you need to design and use your own ground tackle."
1,Not for anybody over ten.,The most booring movie if you can call it that. Budget was probably not over three hundred dollars.Buy a candy bar with the money you save not watching this one.
2,I thought at first this was a film made by college students!...,"Okay, so I go to college for film making and so I kind of watched this film from that point of view. I saw that most of the time the continuity was just right, the acting was okay, even though I thought the mom was actually their mom...I liked how the movie was actually long and built slow. It kept my attention, and I found it interesting and actually the movie wasn't too bad. It's just the acting was bad. The movie kept my attention going. BUT OMG once I found out this wasn't actually a in-college film I was surprised! I was going to give this film 3 stars but now it deserves 1 1/2 to 2 since this was actually a budgeted film!!! I could do as good or even better if I had the time in college and a lot of people to help right now!!! Wow, and the cover looks like a rip off of Drag Me to Hell which was actually a descent movie! Liked the movie, until I found out it wasn't a student film..."
1,Bad Film,"This is not a professionally made movie. So low budget it feels like a student made-film - middle school student. Production companies make the big bucks for a reason and even Paranormal Activity, a relatively low budget movie, was produced with a basic level of quality. This is not scary or watchable. We shut this movie off after 20 minutes and it was pretty unbearable the entire time. Do not waste your time or money."
4,Excellent pop renditions,"Obviously, expectations differ in especially musical choices, and that is what makes the world go 'round. Having owned and loved the LP when it first came out, I was excited to finally see it on CD. I was not disappointed in the performances, renditions, or the quality of reproduction of the product. I have many associates who also purchased the CD, and the assessments are consistently excellent.This was one of James Last's better interpretations of some popular music, especially with the very unique vocal arrangements. ""Music From Across The Way"" is truly excellent, as are other songs, despite the fact that instrumental arrangements may have been anbticipated by James Last fans. This is well worth the price of the CD."
3,Essential for a complete collection,"Out of all the episodes, only one, Michelangelo's Christmas Rescue, is unique. The other episodes appear on some of the very first DVD releases. However, if you are into the Xmas season, this is a very good episode. I just wonder why they packaged it this way."
4,Cute Christmas Episode,I only bought this because it was on clearance at my local Dollar General store for three dollars. Michelangelo's Christmas Rescue is the only actual Christmas themed episode on the single disc. The episode is cute and great to watch around the holidays.The 3 bonus episodes are:Things ChangeNanoThe Shredder Strikes
3,"Too Fussy, Too Many Ingredients","This is probably a great little cookbook for the gourmet cook. However, this is not what I was looking for. I want classy recipes with no more than 8 ingredients (and preferrably less than that) that take a minimum amount of preparation. Most recipes in this book have many ingredients and quite a few call for things I've never even heard of (such as cardamom), and things that I do not have on hand. It's fairly small - I scanned every recipe in less than half an hour. The author does include wine suggestions for each item, if you are interested in that. I am returning my copy."
2,well..........,"its dated badly , this comic, and truth be told its not much of a story to begin with... mike baron surely the longest serving punisher writer, did not have an idea what to do with the pun man as reguards the punisher and the rest of the marvel universe, and it shows in this story, why a fan of the punisher could like this tale with its over the top tech speak and x men villans the reavers attacking the punisher is beyond this punisher fan.... but the art by bil reihold is good and when there is action he draws the punisher great.... one for completists only...."
3,Better Than Nothing,"There aren't many recording of this operetta, which was apparently popular at one time. The sound must have been remastered as it has a tinny quality to it and some echoing, which makes it hard to appreciate what vocal abilities the singers might have originally had."
5,donovan adds wit and verve to rainbow fish,Gail Donovan has brought new wit and verve to the Rainbow Fishseries with this delightful book! My young son and I bothenjoyed the humor and drama of this undersea glimpse into a'school' of fish and other sea creatures who reveal theirpersonalities-- familiar to anyone who's ever been to anysort of school!-- through a wittily rendered session ofShow and Tell. Donovan's gentle humor and perfect ear forboth 'teacher-speak' and genuine kid voices make this bookone that can truly be enjoyed by both young readers and theirparents. I hope Donovan will continue to make Rainbow Fishshine!
1,impact socket,"Not U.S.A. made. This is more junk made in China.Not agood tool,will not give you any service no matter how small the job.Not worth even one star!"
4,A Great Introduction to Trading and Technical Analysis,"This book is a great introduction to trading and technical analysis. The author explains the technical analysis patterns, and more importantly, the financial psychology behind those patterns. He explains how supply and demand, and the human behavior of greed and fear create those patterns.The only shortcoming is that there isn't much material on the other important aspects of trading like money management, position sizing, risk management, system testing / validation. For that, you would still need a book like Van K. Tharp's ""Trade your Way to Financial Freedom"" or Marcel Link's ""High Probability Trading"". I would have rated this 4 and 1/2 stars if there was such a rating. Worth more than 4 stars, but not quite 5 stars.Overall, this book is a great primer, and would still be a very good value at twice the price."
4,A great INTRODUCTORY tool...,"This book is great for a novice. He outlines techniques in technical analysis and even a little fundamental analysis. From there, the reader can choose which method to expand on through further reading."
2,Lack durability,My 9 year old could not wait to get a vetrinarian doll. She opened it up on Christmas '08 and loved it. She has an active imagination and loved the accesseries that came with it. However the dolls hands and feet are hinged and one of the hands fell off after a week of light play. It would appear the DVM needs a DR. She is quite small next to a standard size fashion doll as well.
5,Lauren,"I purchased this as a gift for my daughter. She loves playing barbies. Although this doll is not as big as a barbie doll, she still plays with it just the same. Nice product."
3,"Too big for other Breyer toys, tiny parts lost quickly","She's a lovely well constructed doll. But she is too big for the Breyer folding paddock, truck and horse trailer, etc. And her accessories - bandages, thermometer, etc. are soon lost."
1,Poor Quality,"We bought my daughter quite a bit of Breyer this Christmas. I am not impressed with the quality. Of eight items, four arrived broken or missing parts or broke almost immediately. Two were dolls: the vet and the farrier. One was an expensive barn, which had obviously been repacked and was missing screws. One was a Breyer horse, which had a chip out of it's ear when it arrived. I'm sure Breyer would replace these items, but their QC is TERRIBLE. My daughter's friend has similar stories of poor quality from Breyer."
5,"""It Took a little time"" but today Miss Ross is the ""Boss""","Just relax to the song ""I thought it took a little time"" this album is timeless. Here it is several years from the orginal re-lease date and I am jammin this CD as if it was released today. It's a CD thats legendary. Miss Ross put down the lyrics that will follow our hearts forever. So ask yourself? ""Do you know where you're going to? Do you like the things that life is showing you?"" When you listen to the lyrics of this album you definately get what you're hoping for, good music is still alive. Do you know?"
3,Original was Best,"I am an huge Diana Ross fan from way back in the sixties. She can do no wrong in my eyes.But. . . . there is a reason why the alternate versions of songs were not selected as part of the original albums-- they can't hold a candle to the real release.I find it hard to listen to some different version of a song I've loved for so long-- it is interesting, don't get me wrong, but I think I don't want to listen to dry runs of her fantastic recordings."
5,STILL THE BEST,"THIS CD IS STILL FRESH AND VIBRANT AS IT WAS IN 1976. WITH A FEW NEW UNPUBLISHED GOODIES LIKE ""HARMONY"" IT STILL SENDS YOU SOARING. ""HARMONY"" SHOULD HAVE BEEN RELEASED AS A SINGLE. ""SURRENDER"" IS ANOTHER CLASSIC I ORDERED THROUGH AMAZON BY DIANA THAT IS EXCITING TO LISTEN TO EVEN TODAY. I FORGOT HOW GREAT HER VOCALS WERE ON THIS ONE. A LOT OF SOUL THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE CD. DIANA DOES NOT RECORD A LOT ANYMORE, SO IT'S NICE TO BE ABLE TO BACK THROUGH HER TERRIFIC EXTENSIVE CATALOGUE AND HEAR SOME OF THE GREAT MUSIC SHE RECORDED DURING HER PHENOMENAL CAREER."
5,music fan from dublin,"oh my god...what a lucky day for me when i read the reviews on this album and decided to check it out. this young irish pianist plays the music of field in a arranged in a unique and wonderful way by the well known composer and arranger phil coulter...i'm quite sure the classical snobs will have a ""field"" day with this one but i hope they have the foresight to look deeper into the beautiful playing on this album and realise that this is the perfect way to bring the music of one of irelands best kept secrets, john field, to a new audience. i look forward to the next album from alison hood. not only does she look wonderful, but she plays like an angel."
5,A Very Cool CD,"I have this CD and I find myself playing it all the time! The only thing I like doing more than listening to this CD is going to see this Band ""LIVE""!!!"
3,"Been There, Done That... Unfortunately...","I moved to Southbridge when I was nineteen, and never warmed up to the town. When people said, ""Oh, you're from Southbridge?"" I quickly pointed out that I'd grown up elsewhere, and had only lived in Southbridge for X amount of years. I did that for NINETEEN YEARS -- half my life to that point -- and finally told myself, ""Start saying you're FROM Southbridge, or MOVE.""I moved.Having said that... Since my move, I've worked in Southbridge, and my sister and mother live there now as well. So I'm very familiar with many of the people and places in this documentary. I found it a bit unsettling to watch. There are some real offbeat characters in the film, resulting in some intentional or accidental humor, but at times you have to wonder if there was an innate mean-spiritedness in showcasing some of the town's weirdness.I'd recommend the film, but with reservations."
4,Strong Entry In Intriguing Series,"Frances Fyfield is master of moody mysteries in tone of grey. This second novel with Sarah Fortune has the usual exploration of convoluted relationships and emotions that fom the core of the mystery. Key among these is the feelings that draw into places we know we should not go, but can't help. Tight and suspenseful, this demonstrates why Fyfield is head and shoulders above most other writers of this kind of dark suspense."
2,An unpleasant disappointment.,"This is not the first novel that I have read by Fyfield. I had first read Blind Date and enjoyed it quite a bit. On the strength of that, I picked up Perfectly Pure and Good. I was really looking forward to reading it.What a difference between the two books. I thought that Perfectly Pure and Good was really wretched. The plot was unbelievable; was there anyone who did not see the big surprise in the plot coming a mile away? The main character was even more unbelievable-- a beautiful spontaneous lawyer who solves problems by sleeping with people. She even sleeps with the obnoxious mildly sadistic characters, which was disturbing on a number of levels. It was not offensive, precisely. It was just plain silly.Fyfield did better with the male characters in the book-- the only reason that I gave this two stars instead of just one.Skip this one and read something from another Fyfield series. I sincerely hope that this book and not Blind Date was the anomaly."
5,reminiscent of macinnes,"This book puts me in mind of Helen MacInnes' books. If you like those, give this a try."
1,Don't Bother,"This book is a workbook without answers to the questions. It also contains errors. After all 't' does not come before 's'.We were looking for a book to help us set a standard for our office to file invoices and ledger pages. After reveiwing the book at the library, we chose not to purchase the book, as it gave poor examples and did not solve our problems.With the changes in the way a computers alphabetize the names businesses, there is also a great need for the rules on now businesses containing personal names needs to be reviewed. Computer alphabetize names as John Smith Co. as John Smith Co. and the current rules state the company should be filed as Smith, John Co. Good luck trying to find it under the two different systems."
4,The knot book everyone should have,"Why didn't my parents give me this book when I was a kid? The Klutz book seems to have all the knots you really need and a few extras, almost all explained in a simple way even an adult can follow. It even includes the strings so you can practise."
3,Neat...,"... if anyone in my house wanted to tie knots. They pulled out the strings and played with them. No one in my home was particularily interested. Maybe because I didn't sit down and work with them on these projects. If you're willing to sit with your child/teen and work with them on the knots, perhaps they'll be a bit more interested than my kids heh."
1,Horrible,This time clock has been a nightmare!! Once we did get it going(took forever)it doesn't print out the time so we can read it. Very disappointed!:(
4,"Ridge Mens Air-Tac 9"" boots","Boots are very comfortable,however I cannot seem to get more than a year or so out of a new pair. They wear very easily in patrol conditions. A 9 in comfort. A 5 in lasting quality."
1,It is not James Last's rendition!,"I hope this CD could be substracted from the list of James Last records SINCE IT IS NOT PLAYED BY THE ORCHESTRA! I had this before thru Music Boulevard and found it is played by some orch. called ""Melodien"". - Just a parody of Hansi's style but never ever comes colser. DO NOT buy this if you are a Hansi fan! I also think this item will deter many other new listeners of Hansi by mis-perception...."
1,Very disappointing.,This CD will be acceptable only to those who prefer to listen to the screams and whistles of the concert audience rather than to the music.
5,Get over yourselves and have a sense of humor!,Good lord you morons! Those who criticize this sort of light hearted humor are the bitter old spinsters and queens that want to save the world. It's a damn funny t-shirt. Did I mention it is a t-shirt?!?!? You really want to save the world? Start with something more relevant than a t-shirt. Cretins.
1,Absoulte GARBAGE!!!!!! Do NOT BUY THIS!!!,"The exact same thing happened to me as the first reviewer of this product. Its quality is substandard, It has this foam [...] that is supposed to protect the DS Lite, instead it falls off. The hinge was loose, the pocket where you put the games only fit like one game per pocket! I was was extremely lucky and was able to return this product. I HIGHLY reccomend that you purchase the official nintendo pouch (it is the size of the ds exactly not one of those big game travel bags) N intendo cases are of the best quality, ALWAYS buy a nintendo branded case when you buy a nintendo product!"
1,Nintendo DS Lite Safe Case,"The Nintendo DS Lite Safe Case is apparently not too safe as it broke in two days. It does not close properly and kept falling apart as I tried to close it for my son. Finally after the third time in two days that it came apart, I threw it in the garbage before it destroyed my son's Nintendo DS Lite. Definitely would not recommend this item to anyone!"
1,Piece of trash!,"I got this thru Circuit City--so I was able to return it promptly! The entire thing smelled of oil (yes, stinky oil) so much that it made the entire Nintendo unit stink. Thankfully, once removed from said case the odor disappeared from the Nintendo! Game storage is a joke--as only one game could be stored in the ""storage compartment"" (which was so small that it was a stretch to even put one game in it to begin with!). This is a waste of money--get the Nintendo bag and get the quality to safely store your game machine!"
1,Not a very 'safe' case,"I really wanted a hard case for my 8-year-old, as he's a real klutz and frequently drops things. Aside from the toxic smell (as mentioned by other reviewers) the unit came open when dropped, dumping the DS Lite on the floor and somehow wedging a small piece of metal (obviously from the case) in one of the shoulder buttons. We managed to get the metal out and the DS itself is fine, which is a testament to Nintendo's product quality. My son, meanwhile, is now afraid to take his DS anywhere. Absolutely not worth the money, but I haven't found a hard case made by any other manufacturer."
1,"Hard, but broke apart in two days","Sorry guys, but i bought this thinking:1) That it had any security device, like a conbination lock (they don't)2) Because its a hard case, it was gonna last a long time. (it didn't, it broke appart on the third day of using it).I cant recomend this product because of this"
5,shil lum tao,"i am wing chun stundent. and this book is perfect for anybody who wants to learn the shil lum tao form. in wing chun we use such forms, to develop qi, aswell as to practice are techniques. this form is a great qigong excersice. i recomend it to all martial arts practitioners"
3,Misleading,"The author attempts to combine the Wing Chun basics with elements of traditional Chinese medicine, and accupressure. While in itself these are not that far removed, the book's title is developing chi power, which is not what the book is about.Basically, the author talks about the body's meridians, the acupoints through which the meridian channels flow, and the 5 elemnt theory of Chinese medicine. He then demonstrates some basic accupressure, and the Sil Lim Tao.I still gave the book 3 stars, because it manages to combine 3 topics in a more or less useful/creative manner. However, this should not be classified as a book on Qi Gong, Chinese medicine, or accupressure, as you do not get sufficient information about either one."
3,"Good Reference Book, Misleading Title","Although the title may be misleading, I believe the author did successfully do what he set out to do (i.e. show the reader the direction one's energy should flow while performing the sil lum tao movements). If you keep that in mind while reading, you'll better understand the authors intent. It's very similar to what Yang Jwing Ming does his many books on tai chi chuan."
1,Where's the chi?,"'Where's the chi?' is what I constantly ask myself as I flick through the pages of another one of Cheung's hundred books.Though there are many photographs of fancy hand positions to look at, Cheung fails to answer the title of his book sufficiently at all.Wing Chun is an internal system in which Chi comes from within. Chi certainly does not come from copying hundreds of Cheung's hand movements.It's a picture book of hand movements. Don't expect to know anything more about chi after reading this book."
2,A misnomer,"William Cheung's reputation has the reputation of an excellent martial artist but I was disappointed by this book. My main problem was I bought this book for Chi training - the contents aren't really useful for this though.The book is around 200 pages; most of this is basic Wing Chun forms, blocks and strikes. The most complex issue it deals with is a photographic account of the first WC form and you can't help but feel this is included to try and pad out a book which has no real content on Chi training.A useful reference for WC basics but useless if you're after ""How to develop Chi power""."
1,never got it,did not get it it was a big mistake in the system to ask for my review today and tomorrow
5,best wing chun book,grab this book and learn the powers you have with your body. the way humans are supposed to defend themselves from knuckleheads. help you feel comfortable about protecting yourself in a very smart way. i love this book. shows you times of day strikes to your attacker body parts have the best impact. makes sense. get this book and lower your blood pressure with the exercises.
3,Not mindblowing...,"Chi Power only presents basic exercises and movements along with a description of the body's chi meridians. I regret the fact that there is too much ""tao"" demonstrations and pictures in the book without much comment on them, filling 3/4 of the book. Only the first part about natural generation/destruction cycles seemed intereting to me. It is however regretable that it is treated without much detail."
4,This CD is Wonderful!,"I really enjoy the songs on this CD! They are truly resplendent. My personal favorite is #7-Flaming Heart. I love this CD...truly enjoy it. It has the 'romantic' guitar songs, and some are a little more upbeat, faster. It is great to listen to while driving. It kind of calms you...which is a good thing! Palatable.Check out the samples and see what you think! I am sure if you enjoy acoustic you will enjoy these songs!"
2,First impressions,"The picture does not give a good view of the product. I envisioned the motor being encased for better suction. I have put on the bottom dust chute and will do the back plate later. I could have bought the dust chute by itself and got it cheaper. The back plate is just that, a piece of plastic that will have to be cut out for my saw. I don't think that this will be what I thought it would be. I was hoping for something like what is sold on newer Craftsman saws. My final opinion will come after it is all done and I see what improvement if any I get in the dust collection."
1,Dust Monkeybusiness,This is the poorest product that I have ever purchased [...]. The picture misrepresents the product - in does not enclose the motor/belt as the picture suggests. I have a Craftsman contractor saw and the template for the back plate was not even close to fitting my saw. Upon further examination the template for the Rigid saw was closer to correct but still required extensive modifications to clear motor mounts and belt. Whoever engineerd this product should get into another line of work. Even if the product had worked it is grossly over priced. I returned it.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,Do not waste your money on this product. You are better served buying a seperate dust collector plate and making the back panel yourself. I have since thrown this kit away and custom fitted my own panel for better efficiency. Do not make the same mistake I did and throw away $45.
1,Waste of money,I purchased 3 of these and sent all of them back. An engineer and I spent several hours trying to install one. The directions were poorly written and the quality of the plastic was pathetic. Save your money!!!
2,Could be a lot better,"Uneven book. Too much detail in some cases (to see such and such turn left, then right, etc.), and not enough in other cases. Accomodation listings quite poor, with no mention at all of youth hostels, budget hotels, or alternate arrangements. No mention of important 1999 events, such as World Athletic Championships in Sevilla. In all, rather disappointing, and I wish I did not buy this book. I am now looking for another book that has more comprehensive accomodation listings."
1,Doesn't Work,"Arthur and the Invisibles would not load on a Windows 7 PC. Looking on-line, it appears that other people had a similar problem and none of the suggested fixes worked.I would not recommend purchasing."
1,Get a one piece guide,"I picked this up a while ago at the big orange store. Was squaring off some underlayment but then I found that the cut was curved. You'll get a straighter cut by hand with a chalk line. Get a one piece straight edge or just forget about this thing unless you want two 50"" straight edge cutting guides cheap. I'm going to try and screw this thing together permanently and see if it stays straight then."
1,"Cheap, and still not worth the money","Two piece item. Snapping the connecting piece took a lot of pressure, but it would have to be very tight to hold the joined pieces straight. After that, use is straightforward except for one ""minor"" problem. When using it to make a lengthwise cut in a 4x8 sheet of plywood, light pressure against the middle of the guide produce a bow of over 1/2"". In order to make a straight cut I ended up inserting a screw against the back edge in the middle of the sheet.Adding to the uselessness of this guide is the need to fasten the ends with the two included C-clamps. While this can be secure, one has to be careful to place the C-clamp over the underlying ridge: if placed outside of this the guide's other edge is lifted up, and if placed inside of this, the surface is bent in as the C-clamp is tightened.I've packed mine up for return and plan on giving in and spending the $110+ for either the Emerson or Red-Line guides."
2,It is noisy,"I wanted to replace my timing belt as it had at the very least 60,000 on it. Chose this kit because I figure I might as well change out the pulleys too. My truck DOES run better however the belt makes a whurring noise and when the truck idles at 1000 rpm or lower the idler pulley squeals. Took apart my truck again to see if I didn't put something in right but no. I have no idea why it's making the noise."
2,Not fitting perfect,I bought this kit for My 1995 Toyota 4Runner Sr5 3.0 V6. Amazon shows this as fits to my car. BUT is is not the right kit. Belt and the big Idler pulley fits but the second puller is for older models of this engine(3v-ze) 95 models has hydrolic timing belt tensioner not spring one from this kit. And the timing marks did not match up on the car. Unless you really know what you doing it will confuse you a lot.Bottom line I had to install it because my work truck was open without a belt and i did not have the luxury to wait till they send me a new kit. So if you have 95 3.0 engine do not buy this kit.
1,"Great Music, Lousy CD!","This CD has a wonderful selection of Duke Ellington's earliest recordings, which is why I bought it. However, the sound is absolutely abysmal. Every track sounds like it was transferred from inside a barrel, and many of them were dubbed at the wrong speeds, running as much as fifteen seconds off the correct time."
3,Be Aware,This book is only 105 pages long (not the stated 128 pages); the type is very large and it is printed on cheap paper (nice cover though). You'll have to be really interested in Philmont if you want to believe you've gotten your money's worth. good stories.
1,BC-02 Cartridges,These two remanufactured BC-02 Black Cartridges proved useless. One printed nothing whatsoever. The other printed with multiple white horizontal lines interrupting the text making it also useless. All recommended head cleaning and activation recommendations were attempted without success. Stay away from this one!
1,Barrett's Canon BC-02 Remanufactured Cartridge,"I ordered these two cartidges on January 25, 2010, for 2-3 day delivery.They didn't ship out until January 28, 2010.They arrived on February 4, 2010.As there are re-manufactured, the print head is not new.I installed the first cartridge and the print quality was poor.I tried the second cartridge and it was as bad as the first.I have re-filled my old BC-02 cartridges in the past, but you can only expect the print head to function as new for about three refills.I am disappointed in the wait time, and then the poor qaulity.I did not contact the vendor, as I got a bargain which was no bargain, and I intend to learn form the experience.I will not purchase these items as re-manufactured on line every again."
4,Not too shabby for the price....,"Has some good resources for the budget traveller, at a great price. Not too much info, though, more or less a big brochure."
2,Small Book,I was very disappointed that the size of this book was small and not the regular size book. I bought it to be read in a classroom and it was too small to use...waste of money. :o(
1,whale spray pool,"The picture on the box is very misleading. We actually laughed when we blew it up and realized it would only fit 2 toddlers at the most in it. From what the pictures shows, it looks like a family of four could fit in it! The sprinkler also would not work. The piece that the hose fits into broke as soon as we tried to hook it up! I would certainly never buy this product again!"
1,"Not as pictured, at least half the size","Photo above has clearly been photo shopped. This product is simply not suitable for the children shown, as they would not all fit."
2,I returned this hard drive....,"I returned this hard drive because it has a substantional hum. It also has a very bright blue light on it that illuminated my whole office. If you have a combined office/bedroom, this is not the hard drive for you. And, I found the write speed to be slow. I got a NetDisk by SmartDisk instead. This hard drive makes absolutely no sound and has no bright lights. And I was able to back up my entire hard drive in just a few hours."
1,Do not buy this item,"I backed up all my data, verified it was there, shut down everything correctly and then moved from a laptop (XP v/2) to a new computer (XP also). All of my data is now being read as RAW and unaccessible (computer asks if I want to format hard drive). IOMEGA is no help at all. Do not buy this product. I would hesitate buying any IOMEGA product."
2,boring,"really boring, not enough info about gunsmoke, really generic , just no sharing about his castmates and his children, disappointing"
3,James Arness Biography,"I was disappointed in this book because I felt it was too short and not enough about Gunsmoke which is what I wanted to know about. It seemed that he was more interested in Playing with his toys that he got through his fame, than being devoted to the show that made him famous. His comments on the other actors was very sparse, except for Chester, whom he said they had a very good relationship and would miss him on the show. I don't think he even said anything about Festes. I have read that he was a very private man, and this may explain why his book was so lacking."
3,not so much,"I love ""Gunsmoke'. My husband and I watch the re-runs almost every day. When I found out there was an autobiography of James Arness, I got it right away. Boy, was I disappointed. Most of the info included was pretty tepid. Salaciousness wasn't what I was looking for, but I doubt Arness was as one-dimensional as this book portrays him. There are not even any anecdotes about his fellow actors to flesh them out a bit. As much as I enjoy ""Gunsmoke"", I'll have to stick to the reruns."
4,bonanza is waaaaay better!!!!!,"okay,ok...hold up: what do you think is s great about gunsmoke?!all it is is just another western... now listenhere: the western BONANZA has everything you could hope for... suspense,action,romance...ad its all focused on wonderful family,the cartwrights...a family worth knowing. michael landon as joseph""little joe cartwright...lorne greene as ben cartwright...dan blocker as hoss cartwright...pernell roberts as adam cartwright...and a roommate/family friend:david canary as canady/candy ?also...a wonderful chef/bodyguard victor chen young as hop sang....PLUS...there's plenty of awesome guest stars and more important people....ttyl!!!!!im the absolute,without a doubt #1fan of BONANZA...check it out!"
5,MAKING MEDIA HISTORY,"JAMES ARNESS, is perhaps the finest example of what can happen when a person of quality is allowed to create and shape his acting with the best values that have made America. This book gives us insight into one of the most important personalities of media history. It is a must for any one who wants to understand a generation, who wants to be successful, and who cares about what is important in life.Perhaps, more than ever, in this time of crisis we need to re-look at our heros of which James Arness is one of the best examples. He has imbedded himself in our vision of what is right, what is good. Gunsmoke was not just a show of good writers, but it was an example of good people. People of values who came into focus, story by story around Matt Dillon, the essence of rightness and justice.The present, we Americans owe James Arness a debt of gratitude. For anyone who wants to put IT in perspective, this is a must read book...."
2,"Tall In The Saddle, But Short In Memory","Having worked on GUNSMOKE for the 3 years Philip (spelled with one ""l"") Leacock was EXECUTIVE PRODUCER and John Mantley was the EXECUTIVE STORY EDITOR on the show, I question the accuracy of the rest of the book. True, Mantley became the Executive Producer after Leacock left the show, but Leacock was never his assistant. Perhaps Jim should have written this book a few years earlier while his memory served him better."
4,Fun and Bright!,This Thomas & Friends DVD is full of excitement and springtime. The DVD features four episodes in the new CGI animation. My boys were hooked from the first episode which features Thomas carrying Lemonade quarts. Thomas realizes when he goes on bumpy tracks a fun popping noise happens. He doesn't realize that it is actually the corks from the Lemonade and it is actually making quite a mess around town. I think this teaches a great lesson that just because something is fun doesn't mean it is okay to do. The other Thomas & Friends episodes are just as fun and perfect to get kids in the mood to go outside! With the crazy weather we have been having it was nice to see some outside fun going on! This DVD is perfect for old or new Thomas fans!
5,First Class,"Harvard historian David Donald applies his keen intellect to the life of Charles Sumner and writes a worthy biography of a man Americans should know more about. Sumner might be described as the first ""PC"" politician. If you're interested in the Civil War, race relations, or the perils (and triumphs) of a public life devoted to principle, you'll learn much from this book."
4,Rosenthal's Encyclopedia,"I have passed the PCLE, the Ohio counselor's exam drawn from a Texas data-base. While I thought the book was excellent, few of the exasperatingly subtle, tricky and trivial questions on the PCLE related to questions-and-answers from Rosenthal's book. Hopefully, the book is better for the National Counselor's Exam."
4,great for traveling to BVI,Great book for traveling to the BVI - if you are sailing i would recommend a BVI sailing book instead!
1,This is the true IDIOTS guide,"I'm not one for drafting copy in these review tabs but I had to tell my tale on this book. Give me my money back please. This book is so base and embarassingly retarded. It covers the basics of traveling to a degree that will bore even the first time traveler to death. I have to believe that there is another publication in the world on the BVI that has a true beat on the local vibe. Some suggestions on great things to do... first one is ""float."" Yes, float. Gee I would have never thought to do that on an island. When you're done with that ""watch the planes land."" I couldn't believe it when I saw it. Save your money on this one folks. Unless you want a good laugh or are tutoring an elementary school student."
4,Good Book for Land Lovers,If you plan on staying on land this is a great book. If your on a boat for the week or 2 that you are here it is and Ok book....It does have great info on beaches and good info on Anagada.
2,The Best of the BVI,"This guide is written solely from the viewpoint of the land-based visitor. As such, it is of very limited use to me as I plan to sail among the islands on my own boat. Resorts on the main islands are covered to some extent but those on smaller outlying islands are generally not."
2,Pass on this one,"If you are going to the islands, this isn't the best book. Get the cruising guide to the BVI's, it is much better."
4,"For a Horticulture Class I'm taking, but useful in general","I am taking a Planting Design class at a local college and this is the required text. I like the author's writing style which is easy to understand and which includes many illustrations.The only drawback to this book is that the paper on which it is printed is very thin and there are no color illustrations. Given that the book is fairly expensive, this disappoints me."
5,DEP,"My biggest complaint is that this album is too short. I think this album is far and away their best. Personally, I do not care for Calculating Infinity as I feel they focused on being overtly aggressive and technical while forgetting about melody. And Irony is A Dead Scene is a great album but not as good as this one.This album has everything - technical prowess, speed, and melody. True the singer is nothing special but I still like his work on this album."
4,Consider the possibilities of death metal also.,"I've got to agree with the reviewer D. Grant. I suppose that at this point, it is fair to say that some people prefer ""tech metal"" to ""death metal"", and that it is a matter of personal preference. But if you appreciate faster-than-light, shockingly complex music, and have not given Cryptopsy, Cannibal Corpse, Krisiun, et al a chance, you might be wasting some of your best gettin'-elevated nights."
4,Blows away the full length,"Maybe bands have done better then this now but back then this was pretty intense. It's fast, it's heavy, it's intense and when it's over you wonder how a non death metal band can sound that brutal. Calculating infinity was so wimpy and lame I returned it or sold it days after buying it but this little 3 song EP was something else entirely and after more then 10 years I still have it and still listen to it."
4,Where is Mike Patton?,"This album is Okay. A little on the short side, but still good. Now that the band is about over after losing Mike Patton, and they kind of act like self-righteous douche bags on stage, mainly the guitarist that dove guitar first into my head and broke every string on his guitar in OKC, on the first song, I might add. Yeah that's right; I will never forget that sukka. But this band is crazy talented."
4,change the outer lining,I love this skillet and use it all the time. My only complaint is with the gray primer like outer skin. Why not just leave it alone? This is really my only complaint. This cookware is GREAT!!! As good as All-Clad and at a third of the cost.If I had realized about the outer skin I would have shopped around for a plain finish.
2,Hard to clean,"I like a pan that cleans up easily. I have cooked with it according to the instrucitons and have cleaned it accordingly. I have to let it soak awhile and even though I cook at low levels everything and I mean everyting STICKS!!!! Will not be purchasing any more of this product.NOTE: The seller was fine.... quick shipment. I read the reviews and knew I might have issues, so don't take this rating against the reseller just not impressed with the product."
5,Door Trim Remover,Tool worked great.Just I will never buy anything from you guys again till you fix your shipping and handling rates.the tool was $6 something and weighed 2 oz. you charged me $7 something for theshipping and handling.I can buy it uptown for $13.
5,Explosión celta,"Es un CD excelente, lo mismo que los dos primeros volúmenes. Incluye obras de grupos de todas las naciones celtas (con algunos temas cantados en lenguas hasta ahora desconocidos para el gran público), incluídas Galicia y Asturies, y también algunos títulos de grupos folk de diversas nacionalidades españolas. Un dato curioso: en este CD se pueden escuchar temas celtas interpretados por grupos de lugares tan alejados de esta cultura como Canarias, Aragón o Madrid."
3,Best left to the nerds,"I read all the reviews/hype on this router and thought, ""ya its for me"", but its really not worth the trouble for most folks in my opinion. If you are brave enough to get into the tweeks then go for it, I'm sure its as great as folks say. It found my attached USB drive initially but then things started to get confusing after that. I returned it and picked up another Dlink router (DI-724) and I'll wait to buy another solution to create a networked shared drive.The wireless signal on this thing did seem to work extremely well for what its worth."
