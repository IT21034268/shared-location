3,Not Free SF Reader,"End of an era, old Bean.The adult Battle School types here demonstrate they are not without their own problems and flaws, as they decide what they should do to leave Earth in a better state than it is.Bean also want sto look into the kid conspiracy, as well.Peter Wiggin features, too, but just an average book."
5,Orson Scott Card rocks!,This is a fantastic sequel to the Ender series that I have read many many times. I am so excited to complete my collection of paperbacks in the series and look forward to the next one coming out. I am a great fan of the series and this one lives up to my expectations and then some.
3,Kind of disappointing,"I've read and loved all of the prior Ender books, but I was disappointed with this one. It really didn't hold my attention, and I didn't 'care' about the characters like I have in the other books of the series. Still worth a read, but don't expect too much."
4,Strikes a chord,"This particular book may leave an impression unfamiliar even to Card's fans--an impression worthy of the final book in this series. Peter's is the truly striking story here and not Bean's nor Petra's. We all know Peter's place in the history of the Enderverse--the hegemon who united all of earth. What wasn't known was what was driving him, urging him on to accomplish this garguantan feat. These shadows cast over Peter are too large for even the hegemon of earth to maneuver around alone. What is found here is that the real story of Peter is also about Ender's triumph, when he finally found something in Peter previously hidden behind dark forms and dim figures. Don't worry about Bean's story so much. The shadow he casts is more interesting than the giant himself."
1,This is science fiction?,"The majority of this book seems to revolve around the intricacies of relationships and talk of babies. I think the word baby was used over 1000 times, I was getting really sick of it. Any interesting science fiction ideas or theories were missing or just a rehash of Ender's game. If your a expectant mother who is interested in exploring science fiction this is for you!"
3,Was OSC in a hurry?,"Yes, I enjoyed reading the book. There is a lot of intrigue and strategy, ala Shadow Puppets and Shadow of the Hegemon. But a lot of time and effort are put into leaving an open loophole in the ending while the things that wrap up nicely seem to be afterthoughts. Maybe I just felt cheated by the ending (I won't spoil it, so relax) after all how close I felt to the characters after Ender's Game and the Shadow series. I wanted more personal conclusion, even at the expense of political conclusion.I still recommend this book to those who have read the Shadow books. You can't just leave the timeline dangling, after all. There were years that were glossed over that could have been extrapolated. I doubt OSC intends to do go back and fill in the blanks. It was like eating Thanksgiving dinner only to have the pumpkin pie just crust. A part of the end I was looking forward to was missing."
5,Solid Orson Scott Card Performance,"You can't go wrong with OSC. His writing style pulls you in and you enjoy the book. There are plenty of good reviews of the book here. I'll just say that if you have enjoyed the previous books, you'll enjoy this one. I particularly liked seeing Peter as a decent human being by the end of this book."
5,I love this book,"I love this book, it is one of the best in the enders game series and I am really glad that I bought it."
3,Good but not excellent,"I found this novel good but not excellent. The book is set in a future Earth (about 300 years in the future) and is mainly about political intrigue, warfare strategy and wars conducted by people who were in Battle School with Ender in Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow (especially the members of Ender's `jeesh', the team of then children who supported Ender (then also a child) in the final battle with the buggers) on behalf of the nations that they are from. It has very little science fiction in it. And there are very few twists or surprises in the plot. There is also an unresolved plot strand involving one of main characters Petra and Bean's children. (Maybe to be resolved in a future book?) An okay read but hardly the 'stunning conclusion to the Shadow saga' as it says on the cover of the paperback version of the book. Still, read if you want to know how the Shadow saga ends."
2,A little slow,"Shadow of the Giant centers once again on Peter Wiggin, Bean, Petra and the rest of the battle school students after the formic war. There is more political intrigue as nations race to establish supremacy by both war and diplomacy. Peter's vision of a world without nations is finally established. We are further drawn in to the effort to find ""Petra and Bean's"" babies which were implanted in random women around the globe.A decent, but not great, conclusion to the series. I would state that, much like the main path of the ender series, the shadow series had its best books first. Still, if you have made it this far, the book is worth reading to conclude the events which establish the order of earth after the war..."
3,Recommend if you're a Shadow fan,"I loved the Ender's Series and also the Shadow series, Giant was stronger than Hegemon in my opinion but it wasn't nearly as good as Ender's Shadow. This book is a must for the collection if you're a fan though. It has a few twists that really make you think about the humanity of Bean."
5,riveting,"I don't think I could have hoped for a more powerful ending to the series. The last chapter, ""Speak For Me"", literally had me in tears, and I rarely cry from books. It really makes you wish these characters were real people so you could spend time with them.My only problem was Randi. The character seemed extremely contrived and placed there for either comic relief (she reminded me a little of Tobias Brogan from Terry Goodkind's ""Blood of the Fold"") or for a silly way of establishing sequel potential. But that won't detract from the five stars, since the rest of the material is off the charts in terms of quality."
3,I don't get it...,"I'm puzzled by all the rave reviews this book is getting. I thought it was good enough to be worth reading but by no means great. I was actually a little disappointed that Card clearly set the story up to include another installation - I really want him to just finish the series up. I'm getting a little tired of his more recent habit of wrapping everything up in a pleasant package at the end, with no serious ""good guy"" losses (this is also apparent in the otherwise terrific book Pastwatch), it just seems too easy and perfect. And frankly, I feel like Card is putting less effort into his actual writing technique - there were several sentences or phrasings in Giant that just seemed sloppy. Does he even have an editor at this point?Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow were great books, but all the subsequent books in the series seem only mildly enjoyable."
2,Profoundly Disappointing,"Card has showed his many gifts in so many different ways throughout the Ender and parallel Bean series. However, this ending to the Bean series was a profoundly disappointing amalgam of extrapolations of current socio-political realities that begs the reader to walk away early. If it wasn't the highly anticipated conclusion that it was, I'm sure many more would be much more disappointed than I am."
5,Excellent ending to a great story!,"This book closed the ""Bean"" saga off with a great conclusion. Once again, Orson Scott Card turns politics into interesting drama and tells the tale from a children's prespective."
5,A Giant Book,"What I love best about Orson Scott Card is how human and great his plot and characters are. Basically, even though he writes sci-fi and fantasy, it always remains human. Orson Scott Card has done that in this book, as well as many others. Deeply philosiphical, and also moving, Card grips you all the way from the beginning of the series all the way to the finale. His unforgettable characters, as well as the events and war, will have you thinking them as real people. Love, passion, family, war, and the souls of men are contained. Great read."
2,Embarassing end....,The original Ender books were excellent. The Shadow series gets progressively worse until it finally appears to end with a wimpy conclusion. Some other reviewer mentioned that Card planned to write yet another sequel to all of this. Robert Jordan-itis indeed.
1,Not worth the money,"This mini calculator/keypad may be OK for occasional use, but if you are looking for something to use everyday, stay away from this one. The thing goes to sleep constantly - to save battery power of your laptop I suppose - but this feature is very annoying if you use a 10-key a lot. The device also constantly freezes up - I find I have to stick the end of a paper clip into the 'reset' hole on the back of the device several times a week. The keys are also stiff - you have to hit them hard, which makes it easy to miss numbers if you are typing quickly. I am ready to throw mine away and try something else."
1,This page has nothing to do with the CD named at the top!,I have already submitted a review of this CD. I want to point out that the selections and sound samples have no relation to the Gene Kardos CD; and it is not a Box Set; it is the first of an as-yet not complete set of four CD's.
3,Small,"I love this bowl. The problem is that it is too small. I didn't look at the size when I bought it. It said ""Salad Server"" so naturally I thought it was big enough to put a load of salad in to put on a table. WRONG! It is big enough for ONE salad. Otherwise, It is good looking and nice. Juts not worth $20."
2,very noisy,"This dehumidifier works very well. However, it claimed to be whisper quiet and it is anything but quiet. I have tried it in many different areas in my condominium and the noise level is the same. Good if you don't care about noise level."
2,Auditory overload,"Practicing tai-chi-inspired movements is a wonderful way to restore & renew both body and mind. Unfortunately, within 10 minutes of listening to Karen Holden I started to think I might go OUT of my mind. The woman never stops talking. Never. Because of her continuous, raspy voice, I couldn't hear the relaxing background music, or even stay focused on my movements & breathing. Holden takes the tranquility out of a discipline that requires serenity & self-focus. There are some good sequences in this video, but Holden compromises many of them with too much repetition. I may give the video another try - with the volume turned off & my own background music. Then again, I may just toss it & go back to my tried & true Scott Cole DVDs."
4,Comprehensive Guide to Keeping Malware Out of Your Inbox,"E-Mail Virus Protection Handbook is a great book for learning where your email software is vulnerable and how you can defend yourself against malicious code in your email. The authors provide a detailed overview of the various malicious code threats- viruses, worms, trojans, etc. They also discuss a range of email clients from Outlook and Outlook Express to web-based email programs such as Hotmail or Yahoo Mail. For each client they provide some common weaknesses and give detailed explanations of what you can do to protect your computer. Email is one of the most common vectors for malicious code attacks and it is important for everyone to be aware of how to guard against these threats. While slightly dated, I still recommend this book.(...)"
2,Too many mistakes,Good topic for a book but like most Syngress books I've bought the editing is poor and too many errors slip by and make you wonder about the accuracy of the topics and examples.
3,She'd do anything,"Really, I think that it is mis-titled. It should be for the Love of Serine. Really, Rory did everything that he could to get her and she in turn fought him every step of the way. But I guess that that makes everything interesting. Read it and tell me how much you liked it-I love to talk."
4,correct,"Maybe i xpect more from this, the videos are not all at the same production level, some seems homemade videos. But it's the shamen, enought for me, now i can see all the videos i never view (never have MTV, ViVa or something like that)."
1,If you're interested in historic recordings!,"If you are searching for good folklore music, keep searching. This is a CD filled with old recordings (at least 50 years old) of old LP's, thus the quality is questionable (track no 12 you can hardly hear at all). The reason may be the cheap production (no copyrights). Furthermore the selection of songs is not very clear: some authentic folklore, some choiresque, a christmass carol, some street orchestra and some patriot songs."
3,Not for pipe,"This works very well for wire indeed (as advertised), but don't expect for it to bend or coil pipes.The guides are fixed and will smash tubing."
3,Mixed Bag,"When it's good, it's VERY good -- I was wondering what ""Amazing Grace"" would sound like on Uillean, as opposed to Highland, bagpipes -- now I know and I am not disappointed (thanks in part to Eric Rigler's command of the ""Irish"" pipes)! That one piece made this album worth the price of admission. There are also a couple of traditional reels that are great too. However... the ""strings"" part gets to me. They are too much -- either over dramatic or just real boring -- for example, I was listening to this lamentable version of ""Loch Lomond"", and I was expecting a voice to break in at anytime and annouce, ""Thank you for holding, someone will be with you shortly""! Elevator music!But I'd recommend it on the basis of Eric Rigler's solo Uillean pipe version of ""Amazing Grace"" alone. It's that good."
5,Babies love this!,"Your baby will learn about animals and music, colors and so much more! The Baby Mozart is a great way to soothe them into sleep."
2,"dvds work, but not the right titles in box set","The dvds work fine and quality is as reported. Unfortunately, the boxset did not include the dvds listed. We got the neighborhood animals, baby van gogh, baby back and baby beethoven. I bought it mostly for baby mozart, so this was disappointing."
5,my 4 month old LOVES it,My 4 month old LOVES these videos :) I'm a speech therapist and am always skeptical of putting the baby in front of the tv...but it helps me do dishes while he enjoys the videos in his jumperoo!!! I highly recommend the videos.
4,Great historical find!,"I purchased this book from on ""on sale"" rack outside a bookstore - bought it because it was cheap. What a find! This is a great historical novel about a time in Mexico I knew very little about. The setting and characters come alive as the reader begins to see the tremendous complexities of this time in Mexico. Only drawback - a bit too many Spanish and French phrases (although usually easily figured out) and a bit too detailed in some of the battle scenes - lovers of battle strategies will love it."
4,"Rich, full flavor","This product couldn't be easier to prepare - simply fill the cup with boiling water and then add the miso packet, together with the packet of dried vegetables. Wait a couple minutes, stir and it's ready. And the cup is very hot!This soup is filling and has rich flavor, although a little sweet for my taste. A small splash of rice vinegar fixed that problem however. I can recommend it for a quick, simple snack. I'll probably buy it again."
5,WORKS GREAT,this shovel is well made and works just fine. I like the fiberglass handle and it looks like it will be around for a long and at this price you can not go wrong!!!
2,Grrrrr.,"I read the other review in Amazon about this being the best video. The teacher is just annoying, and there is no music, so you hear everyone slobbering and breathing. Not relaxing. And, the workout seems a bit not centered ... I like the poses, but there doesn't seem to be a link between one pose and the next. Bryan Kests power yoga is MUCH better at getting a full, invigorating yet calming workout in. This guy was so annoying I couldn't even calm down and do the poses. Good ideas and poses, hard stuff, but not handled well."
2,Tough and dry yoga,"I am totally looking for challenging yoga DVDs. While I must admit that I found some sections to be difficult (the mega push-ups), I didn't find it challenging in an overall way: no innovative poses or new territory chartered in the area of stretching, and of course, no spiritual or inner challenges.There was no music, and Mark does more walking around and touching the women than doing the poses himself. His style seems to me that of a Football coach - he kind of stands there barking out the poses.What can I say, I did this disc once, and haven't reached for it again. Too bad. I love a physical yoga challenge!"
3,Good but boring,"No music? Just the somewhat arrognt instructor talking.... While I do think these DVD's could be a great workout, it is hard to get through without any music. These DVDs are definitely challenging, I just wish they were more exciting."
3,anti-man,"Instead of being pro woman and anti-man, your concern should be the child. if you want to respond: jlaurie@netscape.net"
4,Recipe for the Wicked Underground,"Take the following 3 ingredients: 1 part ""musical growth & tightness"" of the mid-90's ""Dysfunctional / Shadowlife"" era DOKKEN (Lynch & Pilson's household name band), 1 part ""hard rockin' crunch"" of LYNCH MOB (Lynch's band offering after 80's split of DOKKEN), & 1 part ""vocal punch"" of WAR & PEACE (Pilson's band offering after 80's split of DOKKEN), stir it up and BOOM! You have LYNCH / PILSON - WICKED UNDERGROUND. If you are looking for the sound of the DOKKEN - UNDER LOCK & KEY (One of my Top 5 Best Hard Rock picks ever)days, this is not it. BUT! This is 4 Star, hard rock bliss! Tight songs, KILLER guitar work (as always from Lynch) & decent vocals (Not DON DOKKEN level but decent) make this a must for the true DOKKEN ""family"" fan & an enjoyable ride for the hard rock fan of the 80's."
3,"EASY! This CD is 3.5 stars no more, no less","4.5 stars is a little high. 1st off, Lynch sounds clear and his playing is tight but his solos on this CD are NOT all earth shattering. Sometimes George seems to be bending the same note for too long. However, I like his rhvthum playing on this CD.Pilson sings well here, and most bands could get by on his vocals, but he can't touch Don's range or power. Bass playing is nothing special.This album has great production and is mixed well. Some catchy riffs but a few duds as well. Drums are done well. Overall, not as good as early Dokken, Tooth and Back4Attack, but BETTER than Dysfunctional.Best songs are Beast in the Box, When you Bleed and Zero the End. Worst song I think is Vaccine. Can't stand it. This is a pretty good CD that will see some time in the player but please stop with the 4.5 stars. It's not THAT good."
3,Disappointed/Unremarkable,"I waited a long time for George Lynch to put something out, and this wasn't worth the wait. The best part of George's music is his blistering leads over excellent rhythms. This disc does not show what these cats are capable of. Ironically, when I ordered this disc, I took a flier on buying Black Lable Society's The Blessed Hellride, not expecting much from BLS. When the package arrived, BLS came a day before this disc. BLS blows this away!Unfortunately, there is not one song that leaves an indellible mark on my eardrums, which means that this disc will hurtle toward obscurity in my collection.I really expected something great...like either Lynch Mob discs, or Sacred Groove.On the positive side, the production is excellent and vocals are good. The rest is just OK, which is not OK from such a talented and legendary ""Scary"" axeman."
4,you are going to want to hear this album,"It is great to hear such catchy, approachable, yet edgy rock music. A lot of the guitar work sounds like Satriani but the songs don't rest on technique so much. This is really great stuff I think a mix of fans should enjoy. Too bad I have to find out about great music like this through the hard radio web site and not through FM music. Rock On! Should be a big hit for partying this summer. Let everyone else buy Metallica. Try this one out."
4,"Finally, a keeper!","I originally read about this cd in Guitar One magazine, and since it got a good revue, I took a chance. I was pleasantly suprised to hear some serious, hard, crunchy, fresh sounding music. Pilsons vocals are great, and Georges guitars are better than ever. Even the slower songs break into dark,chunky, overdriven/distorted rythyms with screaming leads. You might be reminded of some of better, 80s stuff, but the majority of the material sounds original and fresh.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because there is some room for inprovement, but overall a great cd."
5,Awesome,"I am a huge George Lynch fan, so it should be no surprise that I loved this CD. But, I love every song!!! That is not normal for me. Usually like a couple, but love em all!!!!! A lot of people think this will sound like 80's music, but not the case. This stuff is totally new and relevant. You should buy it!!!!"
4,A pure great listen!,"I came across this cd while surfing amazon and damn glad I did! One of the best listens I have had this year. I was never a huge Dokken/LynchMob fan but always found their music 'reliable'. Well everything prior to 1997 anyway.Cd offers great guitar, vocals and lyrics. May take a couple listens to get into but once you do, you'll have a hard time getting it out of your cd player. Stand outs include Ever Higher(worth the price of admission alone) and Beast in the Box."
5,Amazing...,"This cd in one word....Amazing. I have spun this disc non stop since I picked it up. Jeff's vocals are killer, and George's guitar work is incredible. It's a roller coaster ride for the sense's, and I stongly advise picking this up if your a fan of hard rock."
2,I expected much more from this collaboration,"After flailing around for several years post-Dokken, George Lynch reunites with Jeff Pilson and makes an album that, while quite listenable, breaks no new ground at all. It's basically ""Dysfunctional Pt. 2"". Yeah, there's some cool riffs, and all the characteristic quirks of Lynch's guitar style are on prominent display, but they're totally devoid of any feeling. Pilson's vocals sound like Don Dokken on quaaludes - competant, well executed, and boring as hell. You could bang your head harder to the Wiggles.For the couple of Dokken freaks out there that prefer ""Dysfunctional"" and ""Shadow Life"" to the earlier stuff, you'll love this. But for me, it's ultimately too derivitive of the past and too devoid of any fire to hold my interest. This looks like yet another in a series of bad post-Dokken career moves for Lynch."
2,Disappointment,"I was very excited anticipating the arrival of this CD. Unfortunately, this CD stinks. It sounds exactly like King's X. Not a bad band but I thought they could have done much better. I doubt it will sell 5,000 copies. Dokken's latest, Long Way Home"" is certainly no masterpiece but it is much better than this effort."
3,If you're looking for Dokken or Lynch Mob...,"...it aint here! Lynch is an incredibly talented guitarist, hard to argue with that. Pilson is a good bassist, and a talented BACKING vocalist. But their weaknesses unfortunately outweigh all that...Lynch really has a lot of trouble writing catchy songs, and Pilson's voice is just not lead vocalist caliber. I enjoy listening to this because I love listening to Lynch rock out, and the production is quite good. Sadly nothing's really standing out for me, I don't see this as something I'd put on and rock out in the car, but more as something I'd put on as atmospheric in the background when I'm doing something else. A real shame, I was SO looking forward to this... :("
4,Thanks George Lynch!,"Rock-n-roll hasn't been the same to me since grunge music took over many years ago. (Glad that has changed). This is easily the best rock cd I've heard in probably ten years. Maybe it's not that this cd is that good but most music has been bad. What I mean is most cd's have 2-3 good songs tops. This cd has one or two bad songs and that's it. I loved Dokken and Lynch Mob(Wicked Sensation). Honestly speaking this is solely because George Lynch is incredible. After Wicked Sensation George made some so so albums with 2-3 good songs. This effort is much better. When I heard Jeff Pilson was singing on this album I wasn't ready to run buy it. However, he does a great job and perhaps in the 80's the name Dokken should have been Pilson. Thanks to Pilson and Lynch for the music. Please stay together and make the next album harder. 4 stars here because it could have and should have been harder guitar wise.By the way, buy Wicked Sensation immediately if you have not heard it!!!!!"
4,Reviewing WiCkEd UnDeRgRoUnD,"I've been a huge George Lynch fan since the eighties. I play guitar so its always cool to hear new lynch riffs, the cd was to my expectations. As soon as the first song came on, I was like awww yesss!!!lol The cd overall is A okay! This concludes my review.Thank youJesse"
2,HIV,I viewed this films for a class I was going to give to professional counselors -- Film was lacking quality and was aged. Decided not to use the film for training.
3,great bike rack except...,bike rack can handle a lot of weight and is a good product. the problem is that most bikes now have a much thicker cross bar which this rack can't handle. You can mount 1 but there would be no way to mount a 2nd. It would be perfect for the old style 10 speed bikes.
3,Not the typical Bernie Krause sounds-of-nature recording,"This cd is composed music, with place-name titles. Don't confuse it with most of Krause's body of work. I returned it unopened, so cannot review it."
3,Didn't work for my tub.,I would have liked more detail on the application/installation of this water supply unit prior to purchasing it. It did not work for the location of my tub. Looked good in the box and I wish it would have worked. I can't comment on the function since we were not able to actually install it. I am in the process of returning it.. I am hoping for a good experience of the return..
2,An unenlightening study,"This book is a quick read, but not a particularly enlightening one. It describes an empirical study of several Southern Californian cities that tried to put curbs on growth and sprawl. The upshot is that they weren't very serious about it and haven't done a very good job. The first chapter does provide a good introduction to the literature and there are a couple photos of some pretty hideous building developments, but not a lot more than that. Folks interested in the question referred to by the subtitle should read Molotch's brilliantUrban Fortunesinstead."
3,Opened Package Printer Cartridge,"Printer Carttridge appears to work OK but package received was opened (not sealed). I expected, from the description ""Original HP LaserJet 92A Black Print Cartridge in Retail Packaging"" that the unit would come sealed in the original package unless it had stated that the package was previously opened."
2,HP Packaging Damaged; suspect it is refurbished,"I ordered two of these cartridges in what the vendor claimed was ""retail packaging."" They came in a single shipping box which was in perfect condition. The box for one of the two cartridges was severely damaged (torn open and apparently water damaged) -- hardly retail packaging. There also was a blue HP sticker that held the box closed, sort of. This damage did NOT happen in shipping to me because the other cartridge box was in perfect condition. I can only conclude that whoever stocked my shipment made a conscious decision to include a questionable (refurbished/damaged?) item into my shipment along with the other good cartridge. The cartridge from the damaged box appears to work ok, thus far. I really can't return these cartridges because they are in use in a critical care medical facility that is so broke they couldn't afford to buy their own cartridges.I will not order from this source again."
2,Age is important!,"I find that the quality of toner deteriorates as a function of both time and storage conditions. I do not know what storage conditions promote deterioration. My personal experience is that the older the cartridge, the more I have to increase the contrast in the printer settings. My guidelines are to avoid toner older than 5 years old. I determine the age by requesting the copyright on the lower left hand corner of the back long side of the box. I strongly encourage readers to respond to their agreement or disagreement with this assessment."
4,Toner product performs,Still functional even in our $20 garage sale laser printer. We are seeing gradual improvement with each page printed and should be at 100% by 100 pages. Easy to install but a little hard to find the recycling documents. Will take the old one in to Staples.
2,QUESTIONABLE value,"Printed somewhat on the light side when new. The package looked like a new 92A Laser Jet printer cartridge and included a UPS shipping label to return the old cartridge. (I am no expert on differentiating between a new and refurbished cartridge.)The new cartridge was installed 3/15/2012 and for two months printed 600 copies. The only complaint, the printing was light. The lightness was consistent but expected more, until recently. For the next 100 copies, the printed page became streaky and lighter in some areas. Finally, blackening appeared on the printed pages, the printing got really light, and I pulled the cartridge.There might be value in paying $35 or $40 with freight for 700 copies, but I expected more and should have known better than to think I had found exceptional value.Returned to H-P Online and paid $83, including tax and 2nd day delivery.Sorry amazon.com."
4,seems to work okay,Product seems to work. No problems with printouts after 2 or 3 weeks. Hope it stays that way!
2,"Disappointed, the print seems faded","I am not happy with the quality of printing from this cartridge, it is definitely not crisp and dark (sorta grayish and faded)"
1,Not sure this is genuine,"I've been using this same LaserJet 1100 for a decade. Toner cartridges last me multiple years. This one is starting to run low after only a few months. It can be difficult to know on Amazon if you're really ordering a genuine HP cartridge, or if it's a knock-off. All I know is this one has lasted something like 1/6 as long as other cartridges I've owned; some purchased retail at big office supply stores, and a couple even refills. I won't be ordering from this particular seller again."
3,Ok but not an HP product,I was suprrised that the packaging was not HP. I was led to believe from the picture it was straight from HP. This makes me concerned about the quality of the cartridge...
2,Worked GREAT then FAILED,The cartridge was GREAT then it showed spots on the side of the paper that have not diminished. I'll have to look up the return policy. :(
1,Refurbished HP Cartridge but Defective,I bought one of these C4092A cartridges from City Supply Inc. (Blizzard LLC). It was a refurbished HP cartridge but it was defective.
1,Wasted money,The old HP toner lasted over 4 years and dozens of packs of paper. This one lasted about 2 months and half a pack of paper.
5,Exactly what the picture described,"I just got this yesterday and it's working without issue. It was the retail packaged HP 92A toner cartridge and the box it came in included instructions and a pre-printed UPS shipping label to ship it back to HP for free. I'm dropping mine in the box in an hour or so. Great price for exactly what I wanted. I'm coming back, you know, in 4 years when I need another cartridge."
1,Beware of no-name remanufactured cartridges from Abacus store,"These cartridges are represented (and shown in the photo) as genuine HP. However, when I bought one (at that moment, cartridges were sold via Abacus 24-7 store) I have received a no-name box with a prominent ""Remanufactured"" sticker on it. Deceptive advertising at its worst."
2,not happy,the displayed picture was for a hp cartridge but what was sent was a replacemrnt brand and it took several weeks to arrive so I was very disapointed with the service and product t6hat was shipped
1,Rip off,"Apparently this cartridge came from France when the troops returned home after WWII. It is old, print quality is worse than a dot matrix, with light areas, streaks and repeating pattern.The paperwork with it indicates that this is a product packaged for France, as all return/recycle labels are for Europe. It is unusable, and since I waited past the return time to actually install it, I'm stuck with this lesson in buying cheap from this seller.It is in what appears to be HP packaging."
2,Should have listened,"I had the exact same problem as the other reviewer. The picture shows HP, but I received a knock off. Also long wait for delivery."
1,"Ink is on the ""light"" side","We've always felt strongly about getting ink cartridges from the original manufacturer. When we saw a good deal on this cartridge from Amazon, through a trusted seller, figured we'd give it a try. It was a good price, but it seems we got only what we paid for. The ink on this unit is much lighter than we were used to seeing on a ""new"" cartridge. This was advertised as ""new in the box"", and it was, but the box appeared to be very old when we received it. Although the box was inside another shipping box, it was scuffed up, torn in a few places... looked like it had been in storage somewhere for a long time. This probably explained the lighter shade of ink. We've used it for a few weeks now, no change. We can get by with it, but we're not happy. Wouldn't purchase from these folks again."
3,Very fragile,This product is OK as a replacement -- but the clevis pin on the connector will snap off easily. I actually drill it out and replace the pin with a cut off piece of #18 brad use CA to keep in place.
1,Horrible Waste of Money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Want to waste your money?This is a good way to do it!!This is one of the worst dvds I have ever seen.I fast forwarded through half the film and wished I had done so on the other half!!!This title sounded great and the desciption sounded good too but it is complete junk.The film was very inferior quality-grainy,out of focus,very shakey camera work.The few parts left showed very unattractive women-many overweight!!!Almost any of the Girls Gone Wild dvds is money better spent!!!"
2,Editing Gone Buck Wild,"Buck wild girls? Yeah, a few. About 10 minutes of footage, looped and replayed for an hour. I would only recommend spending a dollar or two on this one. Just not enough footage."
4,Work with the homless,There is so few books dealing with homelessness and I was excited to find one. I would recommend this book to anyone. From workers to donors who think homeless help is nothing more than a giving someone a place to sleep and a warm meal.
5,Images of the spirit,If you love black and white photography this book is excellent.Beautiful images of Mexico and portraits of its people.
3,"Good Content, but Doesn't Warrant a Separate Release","Essentially the ""extras"" that should have been included with the Vespertine DVD (Royal Opera House), this release is a bit thin. Don't get me wrong. I really enjoyed the behind the scenes view of the tour, but it's too little to support a separate DVD. In an age of multi-disc sets with extras longer than the main features, many of the newer Björk releases look like dinosaurs. Of course, One Little Indian has never been that concerned with value.Pick it up if you're a completist, otherwise simply get the excellent Royal Opera House concert which includes a bit of this material anyway."
2,Not Enough,I usually enjoy the Bjork releases which appear occasionally. This one however is quite weak. It does not showcase the behind the scenes of the Vespertine tour enough.
2,old research: 60's & 70's,"As a former elementary school teacher, I ordered the book to perhaps give me more insight to my grandchildrens' art work. I found nothing new or insightful AND with research on the net found it valueless.It was a $35 waste."
1,Near impossible to put together,"It should be very simple. Every other product of this nature is. However, the predrilled holes are not big enough, and worse, they are in the wrong places. Brilliant. I had to part assemble, then go find a small enough drill bit, predrill, then, reassemble. NOT recommended, spend the $20 extra and go with another brand. I will never order anything from Raxxess again."
1,"Really, Disney?","Do you even care what you put your name on anymore?They're calling this a ""New Disney Christmas Classic"". Wow. Nice try, guys, but we'll be the judge of that.I'm actually quite proud of my 3 year old for being too bored to sit through the entire, hackneyed mess. This movie is stupid, even for little kid.Oh, and George Wendt is the creepiest Santa I've ever seen."
1,"Cute dogs, no Christmas message","This movie is filled with new age crystals and the need for humanistic power to save Christmas. It never mentions the real reason(our Savior's birth) for Christmas, but has children praying to Santa. Children are drawn in by the cute dogs. There is a token singing of Silent Night at the end. Even Santa is reduced to a hopeless weakling without the power of a dog. The only positive element I found is giving to those less fortuntate is encouraged, while admirable it is not the reason for Christmas."
1,Disney crossed the line...praying to Santa?,"We have seen all of the previous Buddies movies and this one was by far the worst. Not for the acting or anything b/c if you've ever seen any of the others then you know they are all sorta kooky, but kids love em. No, we did not like this one for this main reason...kids praying to Santa. Sorry, but that is just flat out blasphemy in the face of any Christian. We had some explaining to do with our kids about this as well as a few other little things that took place in the show, but that was the main one. We didn't have any Santa issues as some of the other commenters have had. We've never done the Santa thing...our kids have always known he just pretend. I do have to admit though, this portrayal of Santa was a bit strange. Anyway, if we had to do over again, we would NOT have watched the show."
1,"Not a ""Classic Christmas Tale"" as stated","The words ""Christmas"" and ""Christmas Classic,"" as the movie was advertised, do not fit with puppies chanting to a Buddhist statue. A sudden tangent has the pups completely off the Christmas theme, in a garden chanting to a Buddhist statue for no real reason that I could figure. In addition, puppies calling each other ""Dude"" and ""Dudette"" repeatedly at one point did not fit any real purpose other than to make sure this slang was included for the ""Dude crowd."" What the intent was, I don't know because they lost me and I stopped the DVD. Even if I was a Buddhist, and wanted to fit Christmas into my practice, this program was a lousy attempt."
1,Disappointed!,"I ordered this for my grandchild. The movie says color, which would make sense but the movie is in BLACK AND WHITE!!"
3,Okay blu-ray experience muddled by a weak plot,"I watched this movie yesterday with my 1 1/2 year old and 3 year old for their Christmas movie. All of the puppies on the tv screen kept them interested for about 30 minutes, and then they left to do other things. We tried watching it with them again tonight, same result.The special effects and the plot in this movie are weak. I feel like the writers had serious writers block and deadlines to meet. I mean, a giant icicle that holds the power of Christmas and the north poll? Really? Even the actors seem to realize how poor the whole plot is.The video is okay for a HD release, but its nothing special. On our 52"" 1080P Sony Bravia play back was clear enough and colors were bright, but you can tell this is a low budget direct to video film. Sound suffers from the same low budget problems. There are also virtually no supplements offered here (though I am not sure that is a bad thing). Just a few sing a long videos.Overall: 3.0Video: 3.0Audio: 2.5"
3,Only giving it 3 stars because my 6-year old liked it,"I have a six-year old son, so the three stars the movie is getting are solely because of this: indeed he loved the movie and we probably will get a lot of mileage out of this movie simply because of that. However, as a critical movie watcher, I can also say this movie is very far from being the best Disney has put out or the best holiday movie you can show your kids.The story line is VERY weak and, to even the most patient adults, it's not a movie you'd want to be trapped watching a Saturday morning. To provide some context, this is no Pixar movie,Tinker Bellor much lessBolt. This is sadly another Holiday movie that you can overlook without missing much."
3,Cute puppies overcome banal script and bring back spirit,"While the plot of this Buddies movie (you can find the detailed plot on wikipedia) is banal and the dialogs incredibly corny -- plus the special effects are really bad -- the Buddies and Puppy Paws are so much fun to watch that their cuteness makes the 85 minutes actually bearable. My favorite moment is the Ru-dawg joke, quite a nice touch.The blu-ray version is more high-def but makes the cheap special effects look even worse.Overall, a recommendation for those who are into the Buddies films... and those dog lovers who do not take Christmas too seriously."
1,"The WORST Movie ever, save yourself!!!","My daughters received this as an early Christmas gift from family. I guess I should be thankful that I didn't have to spend any money for this drivel. But, I am not. The movie is terrible. The doggy dialogue is repetitive, insipid, and grating. The doggy singing quite literally hurts your ears. The plot is stupid, at best. I have seen my fair share of children's movies, some better than others, this is absolutley terrible. My husband and I are planning on conveniently ""losing"" this as soon as possible. If your child likes dogs, I suggest ""Hotel for Dogs,"" or ""Bolt.""Save yourself an hour of your life by NOT buying this. Trust me."
1,Received a damaged disc,"I could tell that this was a good movie, but unfortunately I received a damaged DVD, so it stopped after about 10 minutes, and I returned it."
5,Great Christmas & Puppy Movie,"After having seen all the other Buddies movies first, this one has a plot line along those lines, it is cute with good values. I put this on my wishlist for my daughters for Christmas, since our grandparent Christmas was snowed out, they will be so surprised to get their own golden puppies. (we rented it until this one comes)My comments below are to 'negate' the comments of other people:I always tell my children that the Santas at stores and stuff are his helpers, just like they do in the movie.The plot line of this buddies movie is actually better than some of the other buddies movies.It is also better than some of the Christmas movies I have seen.Yes, the puppies follow a stereotype, but they show that even with their differences they are good friends and family.My husband & I agree, that George Wendt makes a fine Santa, just remember Norm was just a character."
5,Grandsons love this movie,I purchased this movie for my 2 young grandsons who are brothers. They have loved the previous Buddy movies and loved this one as well. The 3 year old keeps trying to get their dog to talk to him like the dogs in the movie do. I had pre-ordered this movie and it arrived the Friday after Thanksgiving when they were visiting us so they were able to take it home with them. There are so few movies made today appropriate for young children but at lease Disney still mades them. I don't know if the DVD's will wear out but I think we will find out as much as the boys watch the Buddy movies.
2,Not very impressed,"My 4 year old daughter began asking for this movie as soon as she saw the commercials running the months before Christmas. This was our first 'Buddies' movie ever and though my daughter claims she really likes it, neither he nor my 2 yr old son has asked to watch it in over 2 months. This might be because it's a Christmas movie and it's now February but I think it has more to do with the fact that the movie just isn't very engaging.To me the story line seems like one big generic Christmas themed mess with a really pathetic appearance from Christopher Lloyd (as a mean, Christmas-hating dog catcher who later has a change of heart...of course). It didn't keep my kids' attention at all. There just wasn't any kind of cute 'spark' to it - just mostly a bunch of puppies running around and getting into mischief."
2,"NOT FOR ME, BUT THE KIDS MIGHT ENJOY IT?!","Another predictable and silly film with talking animals that just isn't all that good or entertaining. It's aimed towards the little ones, but also takes a little of the magic out of Christmas for the kids. I suggest a rental before buying this one as I think it would get old after one viewing.......Ruff ruff!"
4,Enchanting Holiday Film!,"Disney s irresistible talking puppies return in a heartwarming all-new holiday adventure! Take a fantastic journey with your beloved Buddy friends to the magical world of the North Pole! Join The Buddies (Budderball, B-Dawg, Rosebud, Buddha and Mudbud) in a wonderfully wacky twist on a classic Christmas favorite. When Puppy Paws, the fun-loving son of Santa Paws, gets tired of the North Pole, he finds Budderball on Santa s naughty list and figures he s just the dog to show him how to be an ordinary pup. But when the magical Christmas Icicle starts to melt and the world begins to forget the true meaning of the season, it s up to Puppy Paws and his newfound Buddies to save Christmas. Unleash a stocking full of Christmas cheer for you and your family with this fun-filled film, featuring never-before-seen bonus material. It s sure to be a holiday favorite on everyone s wish list!"
2,Unfortunately we did not enjoy this movie,"I love dogs and my kids love dogs. I got this one because it is a mix of favorites of my kids- dogs and Christmas. Unfortunately we found this a bit boring. Its storyline is below the average - it is too plain and simple. I have a feeling that you cannot find a surprise. My kids could not keep watching until the ending and they went to sleep ion the middle of the movie, which I have not seen so often. I think the producers tried to make this a very simple and easy-to-understand movie for almost everyone. However, I think their effort made it a movie without a real drama and an exciting factor - a gravity toward the movie itself in essence. They should have added simple tweaks in the storyline."
2,"Not up to standards for the ""Buddies"" movies","My grand daughter loves the Buddies movies. She has the 3 previous movies and loves them. She watches them over and over. I enjoy watching them with her. She is 3 1/2 years old. ""Space Buddies"", ""Air Buddies"", and ""Snow Buddies"" are great. The stories are interesting and the dogs are so cute. I was so excited to see the ""Santa Buddies"" coming out. I pre purchased it on Amazon and bought 2 copies. Fortunately I only paid about $7.00 each. I was disappointed in this movie. The story was not nearly as cute as the previous 3. My grand daughter like it OK but has only asked to watch it again one time. She constantly asks to watch the other 3 over and over. I would not pay full price for this movie. It is not worth it."
1,Praying to Santa and questioning his existence,"I have 5 children. I watched this first to make sure I approve. (I hated the part in the Air Buddies movie where the dog gets drunk... Why did they have to add that? Alcohol is against my religion, and to have the dog get drunk was too much) Back to the topic. Santa Buddies has bright beautiful colors and costumes, and I love that. I hated that one of the buddies said, ""come on dude, we all know Santa is just Dad in a red suit."" In another part the boy pulls off Santa's beard (as another reviewer pointed out) etc... What really got me was seeing children all over the world kneeling down, with hands in the praying positions saying, Dear Santa... Amen. Ridiculous. None of this had to be done. This movie was filled with a lot of questioning Santa and I doubt I'll show it to my 8 yr. old, because she's never questioned Santa and I'm not about to ruin Christmas by getting the wheels turning in her head to question his existence! Hope this helps."
3,Cute Movie,I wasn't sure if I would enjoy this but it is a cute movie. I'm giving it 3 stars because even though it's enjoyable I have seen movies that I enjoyed more.
4,Fun Movie for Kids,"My girls liked this movie because it stars the Buddies. Talking animal flicks always grab their interest. The elves added a nice element to it. It is, of course, best watched during the holidays. My five-year-old continues talking about the movie in the days since we've seen it."
3,Cute enough movie..,Fun Holiday movie that the kids liked.Sure if you compare it to the other Buddies movies you might be disappointedas with any series of movies the later ones do not seem to stand up to the first onesbut honestly kids don't care about that they are not going to sit and compare it to the others.Is a cute movie that we are glad to add to our holiday collectionthe ages that enjoyed it3-65 at our Christmas partywas not a movie had to worry about language or suggestive contentamazon vine review
3,avid buddies watcher,"We have watched all the buddies movies. My daughters love them, but I would put this one at the bottom of their movie hits. The advertisement did it justice, but the movie did not deliver even though I really wanted it to."
1,Disturbing on so many levels,"I watched this on ABC Family with my son instead of the DVD -- I imagine the DVD is better because you don't have a movie twice as long as it should be because half of the showtime is ads. Then again, the other half is dogs sitting there with animated mouths. Talking. And god help us, singing. The smaller dogs sing in high falsetto. Basically, a nightmare.The narrative consists of moments when, just when you think it can't get anymore saccharine, the singing dog gets noticed by people who, up till that point were having a glum Christmas, and then discover the singing dog and their lives because extremely happy."
1,These movies need to stop...,"Thats all there is to it. They are just getting way to stupid and unoriginal. They might be good for 2 or 3 years olds, but thats about it."
3,okay movie--good for a kids' holiday party,"okay movie. Not UNpleasant for adults to watch, though nothing I'd ever choose to put on for myself on movie night. The kids do love it--but they love anything with dogs, especially TALKING dogs. Worth $10, but don't pay full price."
5,Great for the Kids,"I Got this for my Grand Daughter who just loves the Buddies,I also recommend all the buddies and Bud movies for the kids,They will sit there quietly watch the films and as a parent or Grandparent sometimes an hour or two of quiet bliss and worth anything."
2,My kids didn't really enjoy it...,"My sons really didn't get into this movie. The jokes weren't very chuckle worthy, and the whole Christmas plot seemed forced. This truly won't be a Christmas classic my kids won't enjoy."
3,Kids talking dog movie. *Warning gives doubts about Santa.* Not Disney Quality.,"I did not like the movie. Like poorly made for TV movie. Not Disney Quality, however my sons & grandkids(ages 1,3,5,9,11)liked this movie since it had talking dogs. I bought cheaper for $19.95 at Toys r us.Santa questions were easily explained as I told them everyone believes different things, just like some celebrate Chanukah or Kwanza instead of Christmas. I reminded them that the real Santa can not go to every single place at the same time and the store santas with the fake beards are his helpers. Dogs praying to Santa were explained as them just making wishes.***warnings kids movie not for adults.Doubts about the Santa."
3,"Kid pleaser, adult nightmare","This cute-looking little movie is one of those bittersweet selections for a family movie night. My daughter loved the movie, her dad and myself were bored to tears. My daughter is four and loves animals. Anything with talking animals in it pleases her, but the actual movie itself was horrible. Story line, plot, characters, everything about it was so cheesy and lame. But chances are, if you have small children, they will love it."
3,Engaging,"How can you go wrong combining puppies and Christmas? Well, you can't and that's the enjoyment of this highly engaging film. Great animation of the live action, and much fun. Extras aren't too much, but a few sing-alongs can add to the season for the kiddos!"
3,Blue Ray Transfer Only Fair,After watching this movie I can only conclude that the transfer is not one of the best that blu-ray has to offer. The movie plot is just OK and not great. Kind of fun to watch initially but after 20 min or so begins to bore.
4,Christmas Movie for Grandson,I haven't seen it but he loved it and watches it over and over. He is 4 years old and this is his favorite movie to watch in the car while traveling.
3,"Good movie for the kids, nothing special though","I got this movie for my 3 year old daughter for Christmas. She lost interest half way through though, so maybe she was a bit to young for it. I continued to watch the movie and found it one of those ABC special type of movies where this could of been on TV instead of theaters. Anyways, good pic quality on bluray, and sound is great as well."
4,Cute movie,The children loved it and it was good for the family to watch together. However I would prefer to be able to download to a movie to my PC since I bought it.
5,my daughter loved it,This is a great kids movie if you have any that are crazy about dogs like my children and neices.
3,An Adult Review of a Kids Movie.,"I have seen a couple of the Buddies movies and I can say without a doubt that I am not the right person to be commenting on these films. They are for kids and to me hold no appeal for an adult. But they're not made for me. The dogs however are adorable and it's worth watching just to see them. If you're a parent, you really can't go wrong with these films. They have great stories, great characters and none of the negative language and scenes, which even Disney has been known to place in some of their films. Just clean fun."
1,Putrid,"This is honestly one of the worst ""films"" ever made, at least outside of Soviet Russia. Yes, our daughter (4) was amused, but that's like saying doughnuts are good food because your dog will eat them. Crap crap crap. And poor George Wendt looked like he wanted to be anywhere else but frolicking with the Santa Buddies. One positive: The expressionless talking dogs make you appreciate how important the eyes are in human communication. Irrelevant, but interesting.So - I don't do many reviews, and most of mine have been positive. Was this one ""illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights, or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable""? If so, it doesn't belong here."
1,Praying to Santa?,"My family watched this movie while putting up our Christmas decorations. We haven't watched any of the other ""buddies"" movies, but I heard so many good things about them that I bought the 4 pack. I now regret that decision. While the movie was cute with a ""feel good"" feeling, it was disturbing to see the children at the end of the movie praying to Santa Claus. My husband and I are Christians and let our 5 and 3 year olds believe in Santa, BUT they will not watch a movie that prays to Santa instead of God without some serious direction. My God who sent His son as a payment for our sins on that first Christmas, created me, this world, our beautiful family and is healing my husband of cancer is a jealous God, and Disney crossed the line."
2,"Kid Likes It, but...","I'm disappointed. We loved Snow Buddies as a family, so thought we'd try Santa Buddies. Not only is it the worst acting I've ever seen George Wendt do, but they have the children PRAYING TO SANTA. What? Not that everyone has to be a Christian...but if you're buying a Christmas movie, you might want it to include something besides children praying to Santa. No other kids movie, that I'm aware of, shows children on their knees, hands folded, praying to Santa to bring their puppies back. Just plain weird. The 4-year-old likes it, but I feel bad letting my kid watch the ending..."
2,Disappointed in ghetto language,"The story was okay and the dogs were cute but I couldn't get over B-Dawg. Apparently his personality is suppose to be ghetto. Well I really wasn't feeling it. A sample... ""Yo, the elves deserve props because their tight."" They throw a little ""fershizle"" in their too. That's how he talks the enter movie. I certainly don't want my 2 year old talking like that so she won't be watching it again."
2,Parents beware,"Okay, so my 2 1/2 year old likes this movie. Maybe even loves it. He asks to watch it all the time, but I think the DVD is going to ""break"" or ""get lost"" very soon. It's a miserable movie for adults to watch. The creators of these movies can make the dogs' mouths move, but they can't give them any real expression in their eyes. Creeps me out a little.Also, George Wendt is the worst -repeat- WORST Santa I have ever seen. My mom made the comment that he's like Santa with a hangover. So, so true. A monkey could have done a better job playing Santa than George Wendt. We have stressed with our son that this Santa is an actor playing Santa, because I don't know what kid would still want to believe in Santa after watching this.This movie has a decent message. Like any children's movie, parents should preview this before letting your child watch it. And RENT it if you must - don't buy it, for the sake of your own sanity."
1,Shame on Disney,"This might pass for the Teletubbie crowd, but this is a pitiful showing for Disney movie. It is not funny or cute. The story is a poor blend of several stories. Don't waste your family's time or money on this ""video""."
4,DIO's still got it!,"And he still knows how to please. Although I was having soundrops on my system in 5.1, I switched to DTS and it sounded great! I noticed DIO didn't hit the higher ranged notes as he did on the albums, but that's to be expected. He did a creative job of finding the lower notes that fit. It's great that he only threw in a couple of the newer songs on, as the vintage stuff will always be the real crowd pleasers. I recommend this one for all DIO fans. WE ROCK!"
5,Excellent show!,"Dio's DVD ""Evil or Divine"" captures a memorable show from the best (and very short-lived) lineup of the band.Dio performs lots of various songs: from Rainbow classics to Killing the Dragon hits!Ronnie's voice is still at it's best, even if he's older than 60...Jimmy Bain's bass playing is excellent as always...Simon Wright's drumming is extraordinary (""Drum solo"" is one of my favourite moments from the show)...... and, not the least, guitar virtuoso Doug Aldrich's playing is fabulous. His performance on ""Man on the silver mountain"" is better than the ones from Ritchie Blackmore and Craig Goldy! DOUG IS THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE SHOW!Sad to know he left the band for Whitesnake... he was the best Dio guitar player since Vivian Campbell if not better...Campbell also left Dio for Whitesnake..."
4,Doug Aldrich is the guy!!,"Man, this guy can really play. Performance, technique, clearness of sound, pleasure to play, stage movement, everything!! Amazing! He plays the old songs like if it was him who wrote them!!This DVD by Dio has it all: crystal clear sound, energy, perfect set list, empathy with the audience, a band clearly at clever edition (not a fast paced, mind-numbing, nauseating MTV-style edition that many bands are using nowadays.The only point I really disliked was the backstage section at the extras. Man, it is a really useless piece of junk. It's so short, it adds absolutely nothing to the DVD. It would be better to not have it at all. THat's the reason I took one star from the rating."
4,Hazy Dio Rocks,"Bring the boys over,kick the wife out,and crank up the stereo!This concert really brought back some cloudy memories of youth.I don't really get caught up in quality of picture issues,since performance and sound are paramount for my tastes,but someone had to work really hard at making the picture this lousy.Simply awful.I just want to see, semi-clearly,the phenomenal talent that is performing.The dvd is still a great buy,for a killer performance and a powerful DTS soundtrack.It's great to see so many classic bands using today's digital sound technology to produce great concert experiences from today and yesterday."
4,"Great Band, Great Songs, but...","This DVD Sounds great, the video ""Push"" sounds incredible, the live performance sounds cool but I don't agree with the video image (specially the live performance). First of all, I don't like the widescreen DVDs but if you watch the live concert you can see a VHS. The DVD it's pretty cool but the image it's like a VHS but the music it's great; Ronnie sings like a twenty year old singer, Doug plays at his best, Jimmy and Scott play incredible and Simon Wright's solo it's one of the best chapters on the DVD. My favorite songs: ""Rainbow in the dark"", ""Don't talk to strangers"", ""Heaven and hell"", ""Killing the Dragon"" and ""Holy diver"". If you like Dio, Black Sabbath or something like that, buy this DVD but the only problem is the live performance image, it's like VHS (of course, original VHS)."
3,"EXCELENT CONCERT, EXCELENT SOUND, VERY POOR VIDEO QUALITY","THE CONCERT IS EXCELENT, THE SONGS ARE GREAT (VERY GOOD SET LIST), THE SOUND IS VERY GOOD, BUT THE VIDEO QUALITY IS VERY BAD, THAT'S WHY I GIVE 3 STARS.BUT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF IT IS A PROBLEM OF MY DVD OR IF THE COMPANY EDITED THIS DVD WITH THAT POOR VIDEO QUALITY. PLEASE IF SOMEONE WANT TO CONTACT ME AND TELL ME I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH.IT IS A SHAME THAT IN THE YEAR 2003 THIS DVD HAS A VIDEO QUALITY OF A TAPE OF 20 YEARS AGO."
4,"VERY GOOD, BUT.....","this is an excellent live set, however, i think there are alot of great tunes missing here. there is some definate filler. the band is wonderful, and Ronnie himself is nearly perfect (as usual) but the choice of tunes is not his very best.it's worth the money, but lets hope next time we get a bit more of the tunes we WANT to hear."
1,Dio's voice is shot on this,WTF? terrible job. Dio's voice is shot in this concert. Why did he release this DVD the way it is?
4,"If you are a dio fan and you don't buy this, there's something very wrong with you.",Great dvd. Buy it now. LOOKOUT!!!
4,not the best image,"the band is hot, ronnie sounds great, and the song line up is awesome.....but what is up with the picture quality? not to mention the delayed camera shots. (especialy during the drum solo) that is very annoying to me!! i just hope that they release ""live from the spectrum"" on the ""last in line tour"" now that one is pro shot. bottom line here?......it's very worth picking up (if your a real fan of dio) but keep your eye out for ""live from the spectrum"""
2,Doug Aldridge is an awesome guitarist,I got this DVD to see more of Doug Aldrich. His playing and the material overall was better on the Whitesnake DVD performed in London.
2,"Poor video, good sound, wonderful performance.","I'm just siting at home and watching the first DVD of Dio. My feelings are apparted. Like many of you wrote above, poor video of this stuff is making me sick! Why do they done it to Ronnie and his all stars band. Great guitar and drum work is destroyed by editor (terminator?). It's sucks!!!"
3,great when it works! has a mind of its own!,"I have a Netgear G router at home and tried using these to avoid wireless/wires to bedrooms. When I got them and installed it did work. After some time (and I didn't use them for some time in between), it stopped working. I do have all 3 lights coming up (means power, connection to the other units and the connection to the local system), and still I dont get the DHCP address I am supposed to get from the router. I went back to wireless G dongle that works always.Update: Tried again once more and it worked again. So using it for now. When it works it works fine.Caveats to follow: (as mentioned in the manual) - connect directly to an outlet and not connect through a power strip etc. (both ends). First connect/power on the one connected to the internet/router to avoid issues.I connect one of these to the wireless router's wired connection and connect the second one in my den to the desktop computer."
1,Rodney,The concept of the unit is that you can use your house wiring as the carrier for the signal. The problem with the design is that it cannot overcome the physics of electricity. Netgear does not clearly explain that you cannot push the signal past the homes breaker system in their ads and hence the only way this system works is if your router is on the same circuit as the adapter. New homes break up room/equipment loads into smaller circuits for safety virtually stopping the use of a system like this. My complaint for netgear is that this is not put out there as a significant technical consideration. Although I continued to use their router I had to go wireless to make the system work and wasted money and time getting to the solution.
3,Speed an issue,"I bought two XE103 adapters. They produce the maximum speed of 85 mbps on the same circuit in the same room. Downstairs, on the kitchen circuit, the speed only hit 15mbps. Not enough to play video. I would expect better documentation as to how to make this product run faster. I understand there is a filter I can put on my appliances to reduce the noise on the lines. But I cannot seem to find any suport for this on Netgear's site.Poor support in my opinion."
5,Works great!,"I couldn't get a reliable signal from my wireless g to my wife's computer, and all I did was plug in both ends and it works as expected. No configuration needed. There is no waiting for it to connect after waking the computer, as there was with the wireless. She's happy, which makes me happy. Well worth the price."
3,I gave up on it,I got a pair of these several months ago but I had issues getting them to work reliably. I am in a house built in 1981. With certain outlets the pair would not work at all. With others it was intermittent. When they connect and stay connected it works great. I had no problems for a few months. Then one day they suddenly will not stay connected no matter where they are plugged. It's probably due to the wiring in my house.
1,Don't Even Think About It,"I purchased these in lieu of running a new phone jack to a bedroom. It refused to work unless I was within 15 feet of the other unit. The plug I needed to use is 60 feet away. These units are a joke. Netgear's technical support people are totally incompetent. So, don't expect any help there. I called, and the technician didn't even know they made this product. Caveat Emptor."
4,Profits Plummet,"Dilbert and the cast of his wacky corporation are back for more satirical looks at our modern business life. Join our crazy characters for some of the following story arcs:The company loses so much money a new number needs to be namedThe perils of discount Irish dancingThe dreaded tunnel sharkAsok heads the office relocationAnd more quick jabs and jokes than can be listed. If you work in an office, you will swear Scott Adams has been watching your coworkers."
4,Not the strongest Dilbert collection but worth the read.,If you have ever read Dilbert and cracked a smile or saw where you worked in the joke then you need to buy the collected strip editions.
5,"It's my ""Bible""","I bought this book for over 20 years, I buy the newest at every 2 years. Even if I'm a french nurse, I consult this book almost every night that I work. On a night shift, it's not possible for us to consult a pharmacist if we need some informations quickly so, this book is very useful to know how to give I.V. medications. We always find what we are looking for; dilution, rate of administration, incompatibilities, adversed reactions and many more.... Those informations are up to date and it's easy to consult them even if we are not pretty good in english!"
1,worst book in history,"This is by far and away the worst THING a human being (or even an animal) has ever produced. This book is literally a crime against humanity. My daughter has probably been scarred for life by owning this tripe, also the film is perhaps the worst example of acting on celluloid, and contains more montage than narrative."
5,Must Read,"Since the previous reviewer has done an excellent job summarizing this complex, dazzling, often exhilirating book, I should just say that I was really struck by Devji's writerly gifts that make layered arguments accessible to a lay reader such as myself."
1,robinair leak detector 16600,"This product was a total waste when i recieved it.It was very unsensitive and could not detect the refrigerant even when it was placed directly in front a open tank of r134a.A waste of money..Of course i purhased it online.I live in the caribbean, so returning the product is a big costly problem for me..so i hav to just discard it..A lot ofg hard earned money down the drain..So much for robin air..It really was ""robin"" me."
4,electronic leak detector,"This is a great tool for freon leak testing, always clean tip sensor after use and store in plastic bag to prevent from dusts."
1,It did not work,"I had high hopes for this device. I have been chasing a slow leak in the A/C of my hot rod for months. First the device could not seem to detect anything at all. So I took it to my local A/C guy to compare it to his version. He squirted a little coolant in the air and the device suddenly sprang to life.....and never again shut off. I changed the tip, replaced the batteries, nothing seemed to be able to stop it. So it went from nothing at all to alarm all the time. Not very helpful."
3,It's ok,I bought this to carry with me when I work out in the field. I'm glad it has a light up display to show a leak because if I had to rely on the audible alarm this product would be useless to me!
3,Almost as good.....,"In reading the fine print, this set is made by amazon, not discovery channel. But....If you don't mind not having menus and chapters, then this dvd set is fine.It seems they just recorded it off TV. Video quality is pretty good, but the sound is off a bit.Otherwise, its a good buy."
2,Survivorman Season 2 (4 DVD Set),"Recordable DVD-Rs used for this with standard lables printed on a laserjet printer.Pretty crappy presentation with no menus and only 2 episodes per disc.No extras, no documentation, barely readable artwork and $1 worth of DVD-RsI would recommend just TiVo-ing the series and save the $$."
5,Survivorman Surives Again,"Les Stroud has a great survival show. He goes into the wilderness, alone and with no camera crew, for seven days to film himself in a real survival situation. The information and survival skills that he shows is accurate, and entertaining. This is not a boring show where he just talks about what to do, he demonstrates it in a very entertaining fashion. Unlike ""Man VS Wild"", Les is real. He does not fake his show or give wrong information. I highly recomend this show to anyone who is trying to learn survival information. Or anyone who just wants to watch a good show."
2,Not the same as Genuine,"if you goto the official survivorman site and see what they are selling, it is much different then what is shown here. menus on that are good and its official. not really sure what amazon is selling to be quite honest"
2,Show is fantasic but the DVDs looked fake to me,"If you look on survivorman.ca it definately looks fake compared the the last one. You can tell because if you look at the bottom they're purple, plus two episodes per disc? The guy before me says there are no DVD menus, that tells me these arn't legit. Amazon said they are looking into them and will refund me the money for these."
1,Not the Real Discs,"Couldn't say it better than another reviewer listed. These are DVD-R's with a label popped on them and sold as the series. No Menus, nothing... if you want to get to the second episode on the disc, good luck, you have to skip chapters and fast forward. AWFUL."
5,"Alaska, the Amazon and the South Pacific...","Besides the six episodes in this set, there is also The Making of Survivorman and a bonus - Surviving Alaska. I love Alaska, so having both the episode and the show in the set makes me very happy.He really shares tons of information, and even shows where he got the skills and information in the special feature of The Making of Survivorman. Sometimes he screws up but sometimes he does such a good job you think even YOU could live on a Pacific Island without any problems."
5,Just what I needed at the last min for xmas!!,Oh my gosh! My 3 1/2 year old loves Survivorman and at the last minute I went online and found it on Amazon for a great price and it showed up in the mail the day of Christmas Eve. This DVD has alittle more inside than what you see on TV. I would totally recommend it!
2,Cheap but not worth the trouble,"This review is for the Delkin (eFilm) replacement battery for Canon BP-511 battery purchased in Feb-2004 (not from Amazon).Battery lasted so far (April-2005) and is unable to hold charge anymore. Battery performed upto expectations for 4-6 months after purchase and then required more frequent charging, until now where it cannot hold charge anymore. The original Canon-BP-511 which came with the camera lasted for 2 years and maintained fairly consistent charge-hold time until completely dying out. If you plan to keep your camera longer, then its worth investing in a better battery."
1,Didn't last long,I had the battery 9 months and then it stopped working. It lasted somthing like 25 charges. My Canon battery has been used about 4 times as much without noticeable loss of performance.
1,Dead on Arrival,When I received this battery it was completely dead and would not take a charge. The date on the side of the battery seemed to indicate it expired some months ago.
4,Some good ideas here....,"I checked this book out at the local library and found I was renewing it repeatedly. Finally decided, since it really caught my attention (and I was starting to wear the book out) that I would buy it so I could highlight all the good stuff.No mistake about it, there's stuff in there I either don't get or may not apply to my trading style....but it's the good stuff that keeps me going back and digging in! It's really a decent read!"
3,"Still awesome, but they can do much better.","If you're new to the show, buy season one instead. Followed by two. Let's hope their drop in form doesn't continue...!"
5,Best Comedy on Television.,"Tim and Eric are must see television. I really like to watch on DVD because I can become submerged into their insane world for more than 15 minutes, which is the length of their show. Comedy at a rapid fire pace. This one is brilliant."
1,"too general, not enough specifics","Compared to other Y2K books I have read, this one is full of generalities and platitudes. There is not enough specific information! It was very disappointing.If you only read one or two Y2K books, this one should *not* be one of them. There is no meat!The Yourdon book (Time Bomb 2000) blows this book out of the water. It is ten times as good."
2,Not as good as the picture looks,"My daughter picks this costume and had a great hope, when it comes, she was a bit disappointed, when Halloween day comes, she refused to wear it. I understand, the wings are not staying well together, like floppy ears, and the wear is too thin."
1,Waste of Paper,"Talks about counting system for Blackjack, huh, thought this was a baccarat book. Save ur money do not buy this book."
1,really for the clueless,"This was not at all worth buying. Worthless information. very very basic. Thought it would help my game but is full of nonsense. dont buy, save money.bad, bad, bad!!"
5,So Easy,This is great. There is an amazing girl on our water polo team who last year made these for the seniors. We had 6 seniors this year so I bought this smaller one where it makes 4 at a time. She made these and they looked and tasted just like the big ones. If you love ice cream cake this is for you!
3,LOVE HENDRIX AND HIS MUSIK....BUT..........,"This is a good live CD by a guitarist who can immitate HENDRIX to a T and most probably plays the material as well or better than HENDRIX was able to on even his best nights.I own a number of HENDRIX bootlegs and he was not always at his peak LIVE ( maybe too high or not in the mood --- whatever ) but when he was hot, there was noone better.The main question I have is, WHY??????? None of the songs benefit from CLAS's playing as he sticks like glue to the originals and adds nothing of his own ( or very little ). Why you would play these fairly pale copies when the originals are still available and almost impossible to improve upon, beats me.I was hoping for an awesome guitarist that could take HENDRIX's musik and add his own signature ( JEAN PAUL BOURELLY / CRAIG ERICKSON ) as well as do justice to JIMI's legacy. I guess I was expecting too much, because this is not it."
4,Interesting developments in the story arc,"Lots of times, in these multibook series, a pattern emerges and then the action in each book is just a variation on the action in every other book. That's what I expected once I realized that Lief needs seven gems. Oh boy, seven basically interchangeable quests.Well, Rodda has a few tricks up her sleeve, and starting with this volume some new characters are in the offing, and some interesting revelations and twists are on the horizon.So, in addition to being very well-written for a young reader fantasy/quest book series, the volumes also show much more attention to plotting and development than expected. And instead of being bulked up and drawn out, the series is actually picking up speed and tension."
3,Too Rigid,"I find the ideas solid and the package layout is good . It is just too rigid. You have to stay between their lines and if you deviate it becomes an ""export, cut and paste thing"". You cannot modify within their software. So if you have any customized charts or such like, these need to be store in a seperate file while the text etc. of the business plans is kept in the dedicate Business Plan Pro software.Overall it is not a ""bad "" product just not as flexible as you would want it."
4,Roadmap to Success,Our company lacked focus and had failed to produce any financial projections during the first 18 months of operations. We were making money but our growth was stagnant. A business coach recommended Business Plan Pro and said our first priority was to write a business plan and project revenues for 5 years out. Business Plan Pro simplified the process and helped us determine the overall direction of the company. In the last 12 months we have acquired several new clients and our sales are up 28% from the prior-year-to-date. Thanks for the great program!
1,"Great if your 15, bad if your serious.",I will be returning this product! Not worth the box it came in. The examples are one line or at best a simple paragraph. Great if your 15 and wanting to start on little business. Not very professional in my opinion. you would think for $100 you would get real examples of companies and not some kid running a lemonade stand!!!
4,Fun Fun Fun!,I bought this for my nephew's 3rd birthday party and he loved it. It was easy to set up and take down. Great part about it is I have several other nephews and nieces.. it's awesome for future parties. One suggestion... the bouncer comes with plastic stakes for ground.. they're pretty flimsy.. invest in some stronger ones.
1,ripped open the second time I set it up!,This toy is lots of fun but not durable. The second time we set it up for the kids it ripped open on the entry way. I have no idea how the tare got there but it is about 2 feet long. I am trying to find a patch kit of some kind becuase the kids are very dissapointed. For the money and shipping cost this toy is not worth it...
5,THIS CD IS VERY GOOD AND I LOVE SPEND MY LIFE WITH YOU !,"THE SONG""SPEND MY LIFE WITH YOU"" IS A BEAUTIFUL LOVE SONG.EVERYTIME I HEAR THE SONG IT MAKES ME THINK OF MY HUSBAND AND I. I ONLY WISHED THAT THEY HAD THAT SONG WHEN WE GOT MARRIED 8YEARS AGO. I WISH HIM MUCH SUCESS ON THIS ALBUM I THINK IF YOU DON'T OWN IT,YOU NEED TO BUY IT QUICK! MARY H. JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA"
4,Great single featuring Tamia!!!,"This song is great!!! It seems to be the ""theme"" of many people in love. Tamia is a very nice complement to Eric and their voices blend very well. I would recommend this song at anyone's wedding. The only drawback to this single is that ""Georgy Porgy"" was on the single. That song has already been released. Perhaps, a different version of ""Spend My Life With You"" should have been on the single."
5,Breathtakingly Beautiful!!!!!!!,"I first heard ""Spend My Life With You"" years ago and ever since I have been in love with it! I think this is one of the most beautifully written and performed songs ever. Eric Benet and Tamia did excellent jobs with their deliveries. They truly put you in the mindset of being in love and wanting to spend the rest of your life with that special someone.""Spend My Life With You"" is the perfect wedding song regardless of what genre of music you prefer. I would highly recommend this song whether you use it for your wedding, use it for a romantic evening, or just choose to listen to it in your car. You will not be disappointed!!!"
2,You Get What You Pay for,"I would only recommend this if you're an over-zealous Bjork fan and a collector of the twenty six DVDs she's released just in the past month, because what you see on this video is absolutely nothing new. You get a few pieces with Thom Yorke (who is of course, endearingly sincere when talking about Bjork), Missy Elliot, Lars Von Trier, Alexander Mcqueen, Sean Penn, and Elton John--who annoyingly rambles on, and also accuses all Americans of being Tommy Hilfiger lovin idiots--to name a few. ""Inside Bjork"" presents nothing you haven't already known.However, if you love her music but don't have money to spend on buying everything she releases (few of us do), then pass this one up. I would instead recommend the Volumen 1993-2003 DVD or the Royal Opera House Live DVD."
5,A five star documentary for a five star artist!,"It may be short, but this is one of my favorite Bjork DVD's that I own - and there are a lot!!! ""Inside Bjork"" is a very well done hour-long documentary covering Björk's childhood, first bands, and solo career. It includes interviews from Bjork herself, Thom Yorke of Radiohead, Sean Penn, Missy Elliot, and many more!"
5,Good elementary overview of research methodology,"This book is not as advanced as the PhD level, but it is a good supplement to PhD material. If you've ever been there, you know Cook and Campbell can be hard to understand, and Sekaran explains most concepts at a very easy level."
3,"Long tarded explanation, but lots of examples","Now, I bought this book for my degree requirement. The explanation might be long winded at some time, but the examples given are really good. It make me able to comprehend it easily. The graphics in this book is not too good as the publisher tends to use only one colour which can make reading become boring. This book can be used as a good reference as it explains steps about conducting research and how to present written report. This book can be more interesting if simple,direct explanation is used."
5,Tink Topper makes 3 yr old's Birthday a huge SUCCESS!!,Seller was prompt and efficient. Product was perfect and helped to make our Grand-daughter's third birthday perfect. Thank you!!
4,Beautiful Coffee mugs,I ordered four of these mugs (buy 3 get one free) to replace my large plastic mug due to the scare of using plastic mugs and water bottles esp. in the microwave.There were few ceramic mugs that I could find that were microwavable. These are so and also dishwasher safe.When my mugs arrived one mug had a broken handle. I called Amazon and they immediately replaced it...received in about 3 days. I did have to spend the money for postage to return the broken mug which was to be refunded to me. I have yet to see that refund. It's been approximately 3 weeks since I returned the mug.The other thing I should mention is that somehow I chipped the lip of one of the mugs but I don't how I did it. I do wash it by hand daily so I may have done it that way. I will see how the others stand up to the chips.The mugs are beautiful and easy to drink from. I love them for the large size.
2,Mug heats in microwave and liquid doesn't,this is a great size for me. The value was good. But it has chipped in the dishwasher and in the microwave I noticed that the mug gets blazing hot and the liquid inside is tepid. I can't find corelle this size or i would be using that.
5,Nice Looking/Plenty to Drink!,"I like the size and looks of these cups (I purchased 3), they go in the microwave, dishwasher, and look and feel sturdy. The decoration is nice and can easily be accepted as part of one's collection. The size is perfect for large cups of hot beverages and that is why I rate it 5 Stars. I thought the price was very good plus the buy 3 get the 4th free clinched the deal for me. As far as durability there is nothing to indicate these will not last and that in a nutshell is my review for the Pfaltzgraff Evening Sun 20-Ounce Mug. Like always with us Great Service from Amazon. Long Live This Great Country!"
3,Quality has changed...,"I happily inherited a few pieces of Pfaltzgraff Evening Sun dishware when a former roommate moved away, and I absolutely love the giant mugs. With one chipped and another disappearing from the office kitchen (at least the thief has good taste!), I decided to track them down and order a few more.Sadly, something has changed with this newer batch of mugs. My old mugs are heftier and seem to have a thicker glaze. The new mugs are considerably lighter, leaving the impression that they'll break much more easily. The news ones are also glazed differently - when I stir the sugar into my coffee, the spoon makes an awful scraping sound/feel on the bottom of the mug. It's a minor detail, but I definitely noticed it, and now I'm worried that stirring with a metal spoon might damage the mug, which is unnerving.I was glad to find the mugs online, but I wish the quality of the new ones was the same as the old ones."
2,Disappointed,"The cup is lovely, and BIG, but I thought that all Pfaltzgraff was made in the USA. Not so... Made in China...just what I wanted to avoid!!"
4,Not bad,"Decent movie, fun to watch. Girlfriend really liked it, and when she's happy, I'm happy.Edit: The movie must have worked, because she's my wife now. My suggestion, if you want to get married, buy this movie."
4,More magic and mischief with Dorrie,"When a red-eyed Goblin peeks out of the laundry basket, the Big Witch faints and Cook predicts disaster. The evening's Tea and Magic Show will be ruined! Anxious to help, Dorrie offers to Goblin-sit, only to discover that it's a much harder job than she thought. After a serious of small mishaps and a few disasters, Dorrie saves the day. Illustrated with drawings by the author."
5,"""Murder in Harmony,"" with strokes of colorful Southern charm","""Murder in Harmony,"" for those of us who grew up in the South in the '50's and '60's, gives many a delightful flashback to the music and other pop culture of that era, as well as the food and slang that accompanied everyday life. Remember the ""sack dress""?The murder mystery plot reveals a secret scandal, much humor, and a dash of pathos. It rolls along quite satisfyingly and wraps up tidily. This is a great beach-reading book."
1,"Moved too slow, not pleased at all.",Can't compare to Warner's Video production of Ali MacGraw's Yoga: Mind and Body. No contest. Warner appears to have gone all out to make MacGraw's Yoga: Mind and Body a first class production...compare the credits between the two. The production staff for MacGraws is impressively large. MacGraw's video is moderated by yoga master Eric Schiffman who has decades of experience.
4,Great screw and parts boxes,"I have been using Plano's part boxes for years and been very pleased with them. I have tried other boxes and they haven't held up nearly as well; either cracking in cold weather or deforming in the sun. The latches appear to have been improved from the older molded in ones, we will see how the hold up. I been able to completely fill them with 20 lb of screws and have them hold up for years. I like their compact size that fits in larger tool chests."
4,Nice storage,"Everything came packaged well and met shipping promises. Though it was larger than I expected, but that was my fault for not doing full research. Very sturdy plastic made to hold fishing supplies, screws, nuts, bults, etc. I ended up having no use for it once I realized how big it was so it made a nice present for my father. He, as always, finds a use for ANYTHING :P"
3,"Well, it's a tackle box.",I've seen tackle boxes that were way better. This one has a tendency to get my hooks mixed with my swivels because there's space for the dividers to move once they're set in with the lid closed - they can raise up just a little bit and get my size 8 hooks all combined with my size 6's.
2,Expected better from Plano,"I bought 3 of these and was pretty disappointed upon receiving them. The case is pretty flexy even with the dividers in place. Also, the lid does not line up with the front of the case, requiring you to push in the front to get the lid to shut and latch. Lastly, Plano seems to have skipped the step of cleaning off the mold release agent. The case has a greasy feel and smells bad. Not a big deal until it gets on your hands and doesn't like to wash off."
5,Plano 23700-01 Stowaway with Adjustable Dividers,Works perfectly for storing Hallmark miniature ornaments. Adjustable compartments work great for different sizes. For this purpose it doesn't really matter if the dividers move a bit (as others have indicated). Stacks nicely also.
4,Should have read about the size...,"I wish I could give the item 4 1/2 stars. I work as a nurse and use this to keep my medications handy and organized, however, the box itself is quite large and bulky for my uses, but for others who would use this as a household storage item, I believe its perfectly sized. The adjustable dividers are wonderful and allow you to make the boxes as large or small as you desire. Overall, very pleased with the quality, but just wish the item had dimensions listed."
5,Great versatile organizer!,"This is a great organizer. The dividers are adjustable which make it very versatile. We adjusted the dividers for hot wheels cars and it made a good case for them. It is also nice that you can see what is inside. My son got a different case for his hot wheels for Christmas, so we re-adjusted the dividers for organizing pencils, markers, erasers, etc."
4,Tough w/a secure closure,"I use these Plano boxes to store small paper crafting supplies. They function well, are tough, and stay securely closed. These boxes are much better than some of the cheap boxes found in the craft stores. They didn't get 5 stars because I really prefer the clear hard plastic boxes that Plano used to make."
5,optical illusion childrens book,"This book is for children and adults. My kids asked for it every night at bedtime. It is a story of a master magician who has grown old and seeks a clever magician to succed him. You (the reader) help the young magician find his way through the World Of Illusion. Using optical illusions, puzzels and numerous surprises, this handsomely illustrated book asks you to work through 10 tasks (riddles...some like I spy, some like find how many hidden pictures, some like riddles etc.) while appriciating the large, bright colored 2 page spread pictures."
2,"It looks small, but it's not....","This photo is so promising.Unfortunately, it stops there.The adapter - in terms of volume - is larger than the stock AC adapter that ships with the Vaio SZ Series. It also weighs more. The only upside is the cord from the computer to the adapter is short and tucks in - but as another reviewer pointed out - this means that you have the AC adapter near you at all times, and not discretely off your lap or desk.In short, it's much larger than you might expect from the photos.If you're looking for a cool little AC adapter for travel, this isn't it."
4,Lead is too short,"I agree with previous reviews that the lead from the unit to the computer is too short. However, this will not be a problem unless you use the machine as a 'laptop' in its original sense. If it sits on a table, the unit can sit right beside it."
2,too big,"OK, while this is a slim power adapter it's way longer than the one that came with my laptop. Wasn't a fit for me, but worked out cause I traded my office mate for this for the standard Sony power adapter (she hand ordered an extra). She likes it a lot because it fits in her bag well (women's briefcase\computer case). I use a backpack and wanted somethign as small as possible."
2,Save your money,"Pros:- Powers on your laptop just like the standard adapter.- A little less cable to deal with.Cons:- Short 7-inch cable from adapter to laptop. A nuisance (and warm) on your lap, and generally in the way on your desk.- You still have the separate power cable, which doesn't store in the adapter.- If it weighs less than the standard adapter, it's not by much.- Longer than the standard adapter by 3.5 inches, and only 1/2 inch narrower.- Pouch is handy for storing the adapter and power cable, but takes up more room than the standard adapter."
3,"Very Light, however adapter cord very short","I like the design which is light and portable with a nice storage pouch. The power cord is long enough but the connection from the adapter to the computer is barely 6 to 8 inches. This means that you do not have much liberty with your laptop.As a result, I keep this adapter by my desk and use the original to move around. It is a good product, but I gave it 3 stars only for the usability due to its short adapter cord. If you are looking just for an extra adapter I would rate this product 5 stars."
5,the best,It provides a light coverage and a great glow. Doesn't feel like I'm wearing a mask. I love this stuff and wish it was still sold in mainstream markets!
5,"A ""must have"" for all elementary teachers","This book provides practical tools for implementing a truly peaceful classroom. More importantly, the tools taught in this book stay with the child for the rest of his/her life. In our world of seemingly ever-increasing conflict, both in the home and abroad, this book should be a vital part of every classroom."
4,WIsh List,"I purchased this book for a local school who created a Wish List on Amazon after being devastated by Hurricane Sandy and losing many, many books in both libraries and classrooms. While I did not see the quality of the book, it was delivered very quickly."
2,Old,"Series has grown old and stale, with this plot being done many times in a more charming way. Froggy was irritating throughout."
1,One Minute?,"Well, Amazon, you've done it again.Listed a DVD with absolutely NO valid information.Even the photo of the cover has more info than you've put here.Length: 1 Minute ????????????????????That is hardly worth spending 1 cent on.AMAZON, IF YOU ARE GOING TO LIST MOVIES ON YOUR WEBSITE, AT LEAST GIVE SOME VALID INFORMATION ON WHAT WE ARE GETTING FOR OUR MONEYORDON'T LIST IT UNTIL YOU HAVE THAT INFORMATION.1 MINUTE?? UNBELIEVABLE and this isn't the only title I've seen with 1 minute listed."
5,"Of Time, Space and Revolution...","Easily one of the greatest collection of essays pertaining to Black liberation in text. Bennett is illustrious for his linear Historic and Sociological acumen - which is appropriate as he is one of the great scholars. However,these essays on revolution, the Middle Class and other related topics are timeless, possess a contemporary feel and deviate from his normative methodology. The writing is incisive and his observations are unique. There's a chapter entitled, 'The Task of the Negro Artist' which is simply poetic and a succeeding chapter on History where he poignantly delineates the pertinence of Historical cognition and this knowledge being the impetus for action. I love this book."
4,crept up and hit me,"read about it in some magazine. didn't do this cd justice. Why aren't they huge rock stars? who knows. If they were I might start listening to the radio and watching MTV again... Favorite songs: Dark and Rainy Town, Movie, Launch. Tres varied and cool."
1,just not that good,"Think the Cars without the engine. One of the most derivative and unoriginal records I've bought this year. Where or where are the hooks? Also, bad album artwork."
5,We love Applesaucer!!!!!,"My husband and I both think this album is one of the best around. We've been listening to this album since it came out, then we saw the band play in Sacramento, CA--they were amazing! We hear they're going to be in the New York City area soon, and can't wait to catch their show again. Their live show is amazing. As our good friend Lolo said, ""they're the best!"""
4,3 in1 game table,This was a purchase for my boys as a Christmas present from their grandmother. We got it and put it together on Christmas Eve. It took about 3 hours. Once it was together it looked great. We discovered that we had missing numbers in the poolballs. In order to get the right pool balls they had to send us a whole new table. We then took the balls out and sent the new box back to the company. It was told to us that this was the only way the warranty worked. This was very frustrating. I hope that someday they can come up with a better way to make a correction. It is a fun table for the whole family.
4,Punk-o-rific,"The greatest thing to ever come out of Newcastle Wyoming. A must have for any lover of goofy punk tunes. It's like The Ramones meet Buddy Holly in the Twilight Zone! Look for their debut album ""S**t out of Luck""."
2,Overrated much?,"I got a copy of this album on recommendation of all the five-stars reviews here.Big mistake.A good deal of the tracks here are half-arsed, watered down Misfits copies. And besides, where's the attitude? At least the Misfits had plenty of attitude to accompany their B-movie horror punk!Trust me, forget this and rather buy a Teenage Bottlerocket CD since, A) the lead singer sings for both bands and B) Teeange Bottlerocket are way better!"

1,Horrible Quality on DVD and CD,"This DVD is completely amateur and very disappointing. Although I'm sure these bands delivered great performances at the actual show, all of the concert footage is filmed from only ONE camera angle. And the only camera is so far away from the stage, you can barely make out anyone who's playing. Not to mention the audio is also lousy. It's like Metal Blade hired someone's cousin to videotape this thing. . .Oh, and the bonus CD of live songs is horribly mastered, too."
3,This is .... okay.,"If you're a Metal Blade fan, you'll want this.The quality of sound here is not that bad. The video tends to be whole-stage shots from a mounted camera, so there are seldom any close-ups. The interviews are interesting (When asked which band at the show he found the most interesting, Cannibal Corpse's Corpsegrinder Fisher replies ""Cattle Decapitation"").The performances are good on here, especially Cattle Decap, Cannibal Corpse, and Armored Saint."
3,A patient's experience with Dr. Machat's surgical procedures,"Dr. Machat has written a book which describes the proceduresfor performing lasik. However, the book fails to mention that hiscompany, TLC, is so overloaded with patient complaints, that thecompany is unable to respond to all of them.I wish that the bookplaced a greater emphasis on the risk of having to have a corneatransplant after lasik surgery. I had to have a cornea transplantafter Dr. Machat performed lasik on me, and then dumped me as apatient..."
4,Much better than the movie,"A great classic game for early collectors. It's not too challenging, but it does have its moments. Just a fun game overall"
4,Throwback to my childhood,"I was in junior high when this game came out in the arcades. I love the music, especially at the end. Buy this game if you want a great throwback to another era!"
1,Never received,Have not received item ordered over a month and a half ago. Unable to track. No contact from seller.
2,Good but....,"The unit worked well for about 13 months. Then the red ""clean"" light came on. I have cleaned, vaccumed, brushed the wires. Everyhting you could think of doing, but light wont go off and unit wont work. After much research, because their customer service is awful, i have learned that this is a common problem probably related to the circuit board. I liked it, but for the money it is not worth only a year of service. Look for another brand."
1,Seller will not return e-mails to return item,I can not speak for the item itself since I have not opened it yet. My husband and I decided we wanted another ionizer and I have been trying to return this one. The seller does not respond to e-mails even though I contacted them in the required time frame for returns. After doing a search for them online I saw many complaints about this seller. I would caution anyone to use them after reading the other information online.
3,Tons of potential...,"The first (and at the time I write this, only) album from The Gerbils shows their potential to be yet another great Elephant 6 band. 'Are You Sleepy?' would be a solid album, if only it were half as long. As it is, the disk is worth picking up for every odd numbered track. Songs like Glue, Fluid, Crayon Box, and Walnuts are instantly catchy and will have you skipping back to them time and time again. The even numbered tracks are all fairly expendable, however, especially the noise track 'Wet Host' (when did these E6 bands get the impression that people like several minutes of noise right in the middle of an album?) If you like E6 bands, you'll probably enjoy much of this album. See if you can't find a cheap copy."
4,fuzz*rock*fuzz*rock*fuzz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Sweet mid-fi fuzz pop with a smidgen of drinkable bleach .It makes me think of hot afternoons in the sun. I recommend if you like singable lyrics and loose but heavy at times fuzz-rock.
2,Dissappointing.....Unmoving,"I was very disappointed with this book. Normally I can finish a book in one to two days, this one took four. The story just didn't seem to grip me as the reader. I found the blending of old legend and futuristic worlds a little hard to believe. I never really understood why Ilyssa acted the way she did. I know she was thinking of her parents, but after 8 years you would think her parents would want her to escape and live her own life. Needless to say, I would not recommend this book unless you have lots of time to really delve deep into the characters minds."
1,Interesting,"I got this album thinking that it was going to blow me away with complexity, melody....anything... but I must not get it. I don't see much more than noise and odd editing. I keep listening to it in hopes that some day it will just click and I'll be enlightened by it, but until that day..."
3,Good beginner book,"Good intro to gin, but not enough in-depth material. Good for anyone new to the game."
2,Disappointment,"I found this book excruciatingly dull. I liked Mr Williams' training book, Bird Dog (though I agree with most of the reviewers of that book that it was long on enjoyable anecdote and short on actual training advice). So I had high hopes for Winston. But the book reads like Mr Williams' field journal--and not in a good way. Some of us use our field journals not just to record where we went and what we shot but how we felt and what the day looked like and any conclusions we might have drawn about our dogs or our shooting or perhaps even larger issues. None of that here. Mr Williams basically gives us a 'we went here, flushed this many, shot that many, went home, then went out the next day . . .' He never even waxes sentimental about his dog. Dull dull dull."
2,Disappointed,"My 10 month old and I enjoy Baby Mozart so much, I thought this new addition would be a hit as well. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was very disappointed with this DVD. The format is dragging, the dog is annoying, and what's with the commentary in the beginning? It felt like a rip-off."
3,Baby Einstein DVD,"I bought this for my grandson who is 15 months old. His attention span on this is about 10-15 minutes. However, I have noticed that as he becomes more familiar with the DVD, his attention lasts a little longer. I don't let him watch DVD's more than once or twice a day and only when he's very tired and cranky. He likes the puppets on all the Baby Einstein movies; that's a plus. This DVD includes some animals he is not familiar with, but as he gets older, I think the connection will be there."
5,Simply Beautiful!,"This is the first Baby Einstein video I bought. It is so colorful and eye catchy to young children. My child is 28-month's old with Autism. She normally does not like to watch videos for more then 10 minutes, but this one captivates her for the entire 30 minutes. Do not let the 101 minutes on the label fool you, that is 30 minutes of video and 61 minutes of music you can listen to like a CD. The animals are: Dogs, Cats, Rabbits, Cows, Turtles, Fish among many others all beautifully filmed in action. It is much like a really good PBS Nature show, but with each animal on the screen for no more then 5 minutes. In-between the animals segments there are puppets playing and some toys to watch- all animals of course. We love this video and it looks incredible on DVD! A must have as well as World Animals. I just bought some more Baby Einstein DVD's and will review those as well, but the animal ones are by far the best."
2,What a disappointment,"I purchased this DVD after my child's enthusastic response to the ""Baby MacDonald"" DVD. I was saddened to find that this DVD included the same old MacDonald song from the other DVD. Also, the puppet shows on the Bonus Material menu are just replays of the puppets from the main movie. The ""Baby MacDonald"" puppet shows are true bonus material as they are different from the puppet shows in the main movie. I do not feel this was ""Baby Einstein's"" best effort. If you are looking for a great Baby Einstein DVD about animals that is worth its get the ""Baby MacDonald"" instead of the ""Neighborhood Animals."""
4,Only one complaint,This video is very good. It is simple and enjoyable. My only complaint is about the sound. It is of poor quality. It sounds muffled and it is quite loud. It is mostly the music and not so much the sound effects and the child's voice that sounds bad. If the sound were better I would have given it five stars.
2,BORING!!!,"I thought that my 6 month old daughter would like this movie because she is already an avid tv watcher but this didn't hold her attention much at all. Everytime it switched sceens, the screen goes black for a second. The music was very lame too and did not attract my daughters attention at all. There was not much speaking or much music (especially in the beginning). It did show lots of differnt animals in a variety of their natural outdoor settings but for a baby the graphics wasn't colorful enough to keep her attention. I would think an older children, maybe 3 or so, would be more interested in this type of video."
5,A must own,My daughter loves all the animal Baby Einstein DVD's. This one is cute and holds her attention. A great addition to her DVD library.
1,Don't Bother!,"I ordered this video for our grandaughter who is 17 mths old even she held no interest in this video. She is extremely activeand I thought this video would capture her attention but not even a little. To be honest she watches no T.V. so it was probably a bad idea. Not interesting enough ,she would rather be read too or be playing. Don't waste your money."
4,Twins Enjoy It,"My twin boys really started enjoying this vhs tape at about 12-15 months. They weren't very interested around 9 months. They're 22 months now (11/03) and still enjoy watching it. We have other Baby Einstein DVDs, and I recommend the DVDs over the videos. For a few dollars more, the DVDs have some great features."
3,good but... it made my kid CRY!,The video is not bad (it is not as good as world animals)... My 16mo old daugther likes the DVD... BUT the key scene you must fast forward is a scene where a bee is swatted... she cried so hard. I have no idea why they would put a scene like that in the video. I have heard this from other parents and read it in other Amazon reviews.
4,Another good video for a rainy day,"This video is what you would expect from the Baby Einstein Company--puppetry, classical music score, toys, live action children and video footage of animals. It's designed around 4 themes, animals in the house (dog, cat, mouse), yard, (bird, rabbit, bug), farm (cow, horse, pig)and river (frog, otter, duck). My 14 month old daughter enjoys it, especially the children singing ""Old MacDonald"" during the farm sequence, and the flying cow marrionette. I didn't give it a full five stars largely because, on the whole, the quality of the puppetry (as opposed to others in the series like Baby Shakespeare and Baby Van Gogh) is not of the same caliber and the toy sequences don't seem to have the same level of wit and humor that sparkles in the other videos. My opinion is that this video is simply following their tried and true formula, granted, it is one that, judging from my child's reaction, works well, but maybe needs some fine tuning."
5,Our little girl loves the animals,"Purchasing this video was wonderful. It keeps our daughters attention for the entire length of the DVD. It makes use of puppets as well as video footage of real animals in the world to expose young children to the wonderful world of animals. There is a section where the video identifies the name of the animals. In the Region Three DVD, the language setting can be altered between Mandarin Chinese, Korea, and English, but you can use the video to teach the words in other languages as well (as my wife and I do with Taiwanese and French.)The Baby Einstein series of DVDs and VHS tapes is proving to be a wonderful addition to our daughters' library and we will certainly continue adding to it."
2,child's attention not held,"I have used Baby Einstein products in past but I have found the more recent titles lacking in the entertainment quality of the older titles. My child gets bored pretty easily with them now, and actually gets a little scared with some of the segments. I am concerned that these products are being made too quickly without being tested on young children."
2,Makes my baby cry!,"Something about the music and pictures at the beginning of this video frightens my 11-month-old. She is fascinated by animals in real life, and enjoys Baby MacDonald, but this DVD freaks her out. I think it's the motion picture of all the cows coming towards her. She hates the music, as soon as I try to play this DVD she really screams. I tried it first when she was about 7 months old, then thought I would wait a bit and try it later - no luck."
3,Nice addition to our collection,My daughter likes this video but it doesn't hold her attention like baby macdonald or on the go. I bought it more because I needed more Einstein variety!
4,Like it,"it is a good movie about animals that are familiar to kids, like the frog, bugs, horses, dog...."
2,We are not a big TV family,"I am not into TV too much. I have one or two shows that I am really into, but if something more interesting or demanding comes up, then I am not heart broken about missing out. Maybe that is why my little boy is not at all interested in this video. I didn't want to be a parent that let the TV babysit their child, but I was hoping that this video would give me a few minutes to myself and prove to be stimulating to my baby. I bought it for him at 11 months and he was not interested. I waited a few months a reintroduced it. Nothing. I tried again a few weeks ago. Basically my little boy is too busy and he seems to learn the most when me or my husband point things out to him. I am amazed at all the other parents who say their children are enthralled by this video."
2,Your kid might like it But it doesn't mean it's a good thing,"Although the idea behind ""Baby Einstein"" collection is excellent, the implementation (presentation) and execution of the idea are very poor.After reviewing ""Baby Dolittle Neighborhood Animals"", which many people gave it 5 stars, I was quite disappointed...Objectively speaking, this program doesn't deserve 5 stars. It is better to take the idea and implement it in your own ways... See it for yourself! I almost bought it and the entire ""Baby Einstein"" when I saw the first few 5 star reviews on Amazon.com!! Until I read couple reviews that actually reviewed the ""program"" not ""the reaction of their children to the program"". Those reviews gave me more of a objective view on this tape and the ""Baby Einstein"" series.Get this program mainly for its entertainment value, not for education one."
2,Seen Better,"This isn't the best video I've seen. I played it for my 8 month old for the first time and I saw things that I personally don't agree with, i'.e. swatting at a fly. My husband & I teach our kids to respect all animals. The repitition is good but I think the dog puppet in the beginning of each segment is confusing to small kids when the background music sounds like a horse or when the dog pretends he's other animals. I'm waiting for our next order of the Bach/Mozart set so I hope it is better."
1,unfortunately the puppets are often unkind to each other,"Most of this series of videos are captivating and engaging. Unfortunately there are many scenes where the puppets are overtly unkind to each other. For example, one puppet will ""trick"" another and then laugh at its misfortune. This may be some parent's idea of quality viewing for their child - but it wasn't for me. I wrote Julie Aigner - the creator of the series - to let her know my feelings about it and I threw all the videos away, except for the Santa Baby one which doesn't have any such scenes in it."
5,Keeps baby entertained!,This is a great colorful video for baby. Keeps her entertained so I could have time to myself.
3,Better than the Mozart--but a bit disappointing,"As a mother of three, I have been discovering children's videos. My children enjoyed this one a bit better than the Mozart, but again, I had a bit of a problem myself with it. It is just not offering enough intelligible information to the age group it is targeted toward. By one year to 4 years, children can comprehend much more than it offers. We really enjoy the Baby Know-It-All series for carla, our 9 month old, and Zaboomafoo for Devon, our 2 year old."
4,A little more techinical detail is needed,"This is a good book and was worth my time to read it. I did learn a number of things. I would have rated this book with five stars if more of the technical aspects of the experiments had been discussed. The interludes between chapters didn't interest me at all and in my opinion was space that could have been used to provide more scientific detail. When all is said and done though, this is a good book."
2,baghhhh.,"Somebody gave me this book, since I'm an amateur tracker; I doubt I'd have bought it if I read the reviews. Parts of it were truly delightful, I admit, but I got a stomach-ache everytime I read some sort of pseudo-science or bastardization of actual science. When factual claims are made that contradict what we know is true (I won't repeat the other reviewers' comments), or are made without evidence or reliable references, I can't trust anything else the author says. It's a shame, because, for example I suspect the relation between foot shape and being ""down to earth"" is bunk (in lieu of carefully controlled studies to verify this), there *has* been a recent study showing a correlation between index/ring finger length ratio and the subject's sexual orientation or athletic ability. But, as with most pseudo-science, such actual science is disregarded in favor of wishful thinking."
5,An excellent source,"If you wish you knew how to dialogue with Jehovah's Witnesses, but don't know what they believe or how to refute their claims, then this is the book for you! It answers questions like:Should you believe in the Trinity?Is Jesus Michael the Archangel?Is Jesus God?Is the Holly Spirit God?Is God's name Jehovah?Did Jesus die on a torture stake or a cross?Did Christ's body rise?Did Christ return already?Who goes to heaven?Is Hell real?What about military service, blood transfusion, and holidays?. . .and much, much more. Jason Evert's book is full of Scriptural references to back his arguments, and it points out the errors of the ""New World Translation"" in the chapter, ""Can You Trust the 'New World Translation'?"" The book is easy to navigate and read, and is packed with great information."
4,A superb way to learn fairly basic Hebrew,"All I can say is that the method has been extremely effective for me! Before this I took the Pimsleur Polish course with great results.I went to Hebrew school for a few years as a child and can read phonetically, but I have never really learned conversational Hebrew. The lessons are effective in teaching basic phrasing and composing sentences.I strongly recommend this enjoyable, effective course. Furthermore, I don't know of any other good Hebrew audio-course."
5,The best way to learn a language!,"I had a mental block about learning languages when I was a boy. It was only when I took an immersion class that I realized that I could learn a foreign language. The Pimsleur method is like an immersion class. Immediately you find yourself actually speaking the language you are studying. It is fun and effective. I am just finishing Madarin Chinese I and have already started Hebrew II. I have tried out my new skills on native speakers so I know I am learning the real thing. If you want to learn Chinese, Hebrew or any other language, Pimsleur is definitely the best way to go."

5,A must-have for synthpop lovers!,"I've always loved the popular synthpop bands from the 80's (Depeche Mode, Camouflage, Erasure, Xymox, etc.) but I was ready to expand my collection when I happened upon neo-synth here on Amazon.com. I thought I'd give these CDs a try and now there is no turning back! After a few listens I was hooked! A whole new world of music has been opened to me and I feel like a teenager discovering music I love again! Some of the bands I want to explore more of are The Nine (hard-edged and very catchy), B! Machine (dream-like with an amazing voice) and Iris (refreshing) plus an old favorite with an ever evolving sound--Alphaville. Actually, I don't think there's a song I don't like in this collection. Bottom line-if you like synthpop, you gotta have these CDs."
5,The DVD's and CD's are the best,"I could listen to, or watch ABBA all day and never get tired of it. Their unique sound and harmony is the best I've ever heard. Can't get enough of them. Too bad they had to break up. I love to watch Benny on the Piano. They all look like they are having so much fun."
5,ABBA Looks Gorgeous in Blu-ray!,"I used to have the DVD and thought the PQ was fine on my HD TV. But I sold the DVD and bought this blu-ray because I wanted to have and enjoy the best ABBA. You know what? This blu-ray is da bomb in PQ and AQ. Huge improvement! You will enjoy every single bit of each member of ABBA in such detail. The design of main menu and extras, which I believe were re-designed for blu-ray, is beautiful and creative. The each image of gallery of the movie posters looks so sharp and clean in HD. I'm happy I got this blu-ray. I just hope ""all"" ABBA's previous video materials will be released in blu-ray as well...very soon.P.S. On the cover, it says the vision is in 1080i but actually 1080p."
4,A Long Time To Wait,"Why does the information above list the release date as January 1, 2010?? That's a hell of a long time to wait."
1,Not the movie,"This is ABBA the movie, but not the version that you should get. Universal Music holds the rights to the entire ABBA cataloge. And they are currently restoring their own version of this movie which will be far superior to the Warner version and released around the same time in 5.1 stereo. Don't be tricked into buying the wrong one. Go to abbathesite.com for moreinfo about these two new releases."
4,I've got to track down this review.,"ABBA The MovieThe story is aussie radio dj has to get interview with ABBA for documentary (er, I mean't event.) It is the story of how he does it, as the dj chases ABBA on tour down under. Positive,you get to hear some of the lesser known tunes. Personally, I love ABBA performing Tiger, very campy. You get to hear Agnetha's reply to having the world's sexiest bottom. What is it about? It is about an hour and a half. It is a good time. Very formula plot. So recommendation is it? ABBA fans, Yea! Everyone else, nay. Call over your friends, shut your mind off, put your favorite beverage on ice, and pop some corn. Prepare to pleasently waste about 90 minutes and take it for what it is. As for me, I am a yea."
5,Another ABBA fan checking in...,"Had this movie in my Netflix instant queue forever and watched it several times. However, Netflix removed it at the first of the year. Therefore, I figured it was a good excuse to go ahead and purchase the Blu-ray version. Already have the '79 North American Concert DVD, so this was a must have to bookend the collection of all my other ABBA documentary DVDs. The audio and video is great, considering the source material is 30+ years old. I particularly enjoyed the interview with Bjorn, Benny, and Lasse Hallstrom in the Bonus section. Some good insight into the making of the movie and the reasoning behind the Ashley Wallace DJ plot."
2,Not Good If You Want an Abba Concert,"I was hoping this would have some good concert music tracks of Abba's Australian concert tour. What a Disappointment. Almost all the songs are only partially played, and the sound quality is mediocre. There is way too much talking by an inane host who talks nonsensically non-stop. If you want a great Abba Concert, I suggest you get Abba, In Concert which features well recorded songs from the 1979 Wembley concert. It is visually stunning with Abba looking and sounding their best. If you want a goofy movie about Abba, then get Abba the Movie. If you want a first rate Abba Concert, get Abba In Concert. I guess the titles say it all."
4,Es increhible pero al fin en DVD,"Por fin ABBA edito en DVD su pelicula la cual salio al mercado 1978 en cines de todo el mundo muy bueno es de coleccion ya que solo se conseguia en bootlegs pero por fin pero como que es algo dificil de conseguir no es facil pero vale la paena, mayor informacion en PolarWorks Collectors todo lo relacionado con ABBA."
4,WTF?,This has got to be some kind of joke...No video i've ever seen has been scheduled this far in advance.A few months ahead of time sure...But 4 years??? Must have been a misprint.
4,Abba the Movie,"The movie was good and fairly entertaining, but it had technical glitches where it would stop and then start again."
2,I love ABBA,"I bought this DVD expecting viewing it to be as enjoyableas the other ABBA DVD's I have purchased. The ""plot""consists of a country and western DJ chasing ABBA all overAustralia to get an interview. Too much of the inane trialsand tribulations of said DJ and not nearly enough of the ABBAperformances. I love ABBA and dearly love to watch them perform.I've seen -The Movie- about a dozen times now and saw something newand very enjoyable each time. Lasse the director said the ""plot""was necessary because people would get bored if there werenothing but performances. I disagree! I dearly love to see them perform,I'm glad I bought -The Movie- and encourage others to buy it ifthey love ABBA as much as I do!"
3,Disappointing,"I was hoping for more from ""ABBA The Movie"".The problem is there's too much movie -- a stupid running gag about a hapless disk jockey trying to score an interview with the group on their Australian tour -- and not enough ABBA live in concert.What's more, the live footage covers too many of their (deservedly) lesser known songs and not enough of their classic hits.On the plus side, the sound quality is quite good.And then there's Agnetha's backside -- ""Agnetha's bottom is tops at show"" says one newspaper review headline, and the footage here demonstrates why, with no ifs, ands, or -- butts! Seriously, J Lo and the Kardashians have NOTHING on Agnetha!I have ordered ""ABBA In Concert"", despite what I understand is pretty poor sound, because they perform more of their biggest hits.It would be nice if they released ALL the concert footage from ""ABBA The Movie"" WITHOUT the dopey d.j. and backstage stuff. THAT might earn five stars from me..."
2,Abba Fans will find this a 5 star item due to its live footage.,"This feature is really about showing ABBA in concert. If you are a fan of their music you will almost certainly enjoy this disc because of the concert footage and live recordings. However, if you are simply looking to watch a movie, Abba ""The Movie"" won't deliver. There is really not anything close to a plot or storyline in this film, some would call it more of a ""Rockumentary"" or in this case (am I coining new terminology here?) a ""Popumentary"" because ABBA are certainly the greatest pop act of all time. Mind you I'm not slamming ABBA here, I'm their self professed biggest fan. I just don't think this film was ever intended to impress anyone other than a fan of ABBA, or a would-be fan. If you don't like their music you won't like this film. Even if you like their music there is a small chance you might not like this film.As for me I'm a die hard fan, I'm buying it for the live footage alone.WSCarthage, TX"
3,ABBA the movie,"Music was very good but some songs were cut short. Too much showing ""our hero"" and his problems. Should have more of ABBA and less of him. Also,the plot was a little thin."
1,no way!!!,"This song is sooo anoyying! Girls don't just want cars and money, and I don't think anyone who is not a girl can really say what we want! The music is really bad and repetitive. The video sucks - this is just all around horrible. I can't find a single thing I like about it, and girls don't listen to this song if you are 11 or older, it will just make you angry!"
3,4 TV shows & a movie all with Bronson,"The 4 half hour TV shows are in black in white without the original commercials. Print quality for these is very good. They are:US Marshall Pursuit. Bronson is an AWOL army private on the run.Four Star Playhouse. He's a man on trial for a crime he didn't commit.Man With A camera. 2 episodes. Missing, where he looks for a mans wife & String Of Pearls, where he helps stop a con man.The movie is Lola. 1:66 aspect ratio (letterbox with thin lines top & bottom of screen) & in color. Bronson is a writer in England in love with a 16 year old girl. A good movie but a used film print with some scratches here & there. The color is good and so is the sound.I bought the DVD in a computer/video store & was not disappointed with the video/sound quality or the contents. In other words is was worth the $6 I spent and is a title I will keep in my collection."
3,CHARLES BRONSON - LOST EPISODES,"If you're a Bronson fan, then you might like seeing these older movies too. They are not equal in my opinion to the DEATH WISH series, but they are worth watching and having in your collection. July 2009."
2,Sub-par audio and a persistent company logo,"""The Lost Episodes"" is a misnomer. Nothing on this single disc collection was ever ""missing."" An annoying PLATINUM DISC CORPORATION logo stays on-screen almost constantly.Video of the Dick Powell TV vehicle ""Four Star Playhouse"" is clean; audio lacks high end. Mr. Bronson is a supporting player in this half-hour drama which was directed by Robert Aldrich (WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE?).Colors of the feature film LOLA are slightly faded; picture is a tad dark. Sound is way overmodulated and distorts frequently.Image on the U.S. MARSHAL episode could be sharper; audio is again TOO LOUD. The opening theme sounds terrible.Audio on the two MAN WITH A CAMERA examples is muffled; video is acceptable.I paid under a buck for this item; worth it for a chance to see 4 TV shows and a movie that are new to me. Due to poor sound and that watermark, don't spend much more than that."
2,Disapointing release,"I bought this for the 2 TV episode that were Empire Theater, while it was nice to see early Bronson TV roles, I don't like the pop up label logo on the feature & I found that distracting.Lola or Twinky as it's is else where seem to be the same sad copy that is on so many of these dvds.2 stars because it's early Bronson that seems impossible to get else where."
1,Overrated,"One of our most overrated contemporary authors. No more wit or insight than you'll find in a ordinary ""chick-lit"" novel."
3,Characterisation is this novel's strong point,Great characters but at times the pace of the story is too slow. Rather wordy but highlights the cultural differences between England and America. Worth reading if you can stand the slow pace.
2,Was 1985 a slow year for novels?,"I have read about a quarter of all the books that have won the Pulitzer, and I am attempting to read them all in the next year or so. I think 1985 may have been a slow year for writers. This book is good, yes, but Pulitzer good? No. I never really connected with either character, and felt that some of the writing, for lack of a better word, was cheesy (i.e the entire ""Fido"" creation). Compared with the Pulitzer winners from the years before and after, the book is weak. This may be an unfair criticism, and maybe the Pulitzer stamp on the front of the book lead to unfair expectations, but the book just does not do ""it"" for me. And that undefineable ""it"" is what makes me not recommend this book to other readers."
2,Humorous Tales of Americans in London,"The sometimes overlapping stories of Vinnie Miner and Fred Turner, two Americans conducting literary research in London, prove entertaining, even if a bit contrived. The earlier portions of the stories are much better at communicating the tongue-in-cheek narrative on American perceptions of England (and American perceptions of America) and some of the dialogue and musings that Lurie provides for Miner are down right hysterical.This is very easy and pleasant read. The strength of this book is Lurie's ability to provide satirical and witty commentary on life in general and on life abroad. The power of this is diluted as the focus of the book changes from that commentary to the details of a story which become overdramatized. In doing this, Lurie loses much of the cleverness contained in the first three-quarters of the book."
5,Her best book by far,"One of the better works of contemporary literature, one of my personal favorites"
5,Awesome DV camera,"Considering the low price, this camera has tons of features and the output is awesome. All you need is a Firewire cable and you can start editing movies right on your computer. This camera is actually less expensive than many VHS-C analog/Hi-8 analog cams. Good deal if you can find it."
4,Outstanding Performance,"Versatile clean sound. One of the few amplifiers that can accept inputs from receiver speaker outputs. Although I don't use if for that purpose anymore it works great as a zone 2 outdoor speaker amplifier. The only feature I don't like about it is that there are no volume controls, only a limited gain control."
3,Good Read,"A mystery that was written very well and a must for the technically-oriented reader. When Tory Travers is assigned to over see the building of a new football stadium for the local university, strange things begin to happen. The son-in-law of the pre-cast yard disappears along with all the records of the column pourer. After that a quality control technician is found dead. It just happens to be a budding investigative reporter who had just interviewed Tory. Detective David Alvarez comes into Tory's life to investigate what's happening. He quietly starts to look into Tory's background. He uncovers a mysterious past involving a state Senator, a police record and a love affair. Tory soon receives death-threats to stay away from her job. Suspense builds at the construction site where death awaits. Be prepared for a very surprising ending. I thought this book was a good read and would recommend it to anyone."
1,"Poorly written, this writer needs a good editor","This book was very disappointing. I was really looking forward to reading about this woman engineer in the Southwest. The idea is intriguing and the setting unusual. But Ms. Schumacher is not a good writer, even taking into account that this is her first book. The cliches are abundant and the characters are flat and sterotypical. There is the sexy cop, the bossy secretary, the typical sexists who give the spunky woman a hard time. The author's idea of character development is to give a cop a stutter. The original idea of having a woman engineer as the protagonist gets lost in the worn out devices used by the author."
2,Is this really contemporary classical music?,"Who cannot admire the technical felicity of Liebermann's second piano concerto? His mastery of classical and romatic form and orchestration are plain. But should we be seduced by the blatent references to Rachmaninoff and recycling Ravel. These naughty -- but not really very naughty at all -- dissonances and irregular rhythms are really too timid.What could Liebermann do with all his immense technical powers?I would have been shocked in 1907, but in 2007 I think I was stroked too much."
5,Excellent Novelization,This Novelization came by high recommendation and it lived up to it. In this interesting novel we (at certain points) get to see the classic film from the perspective of the Predator himself and learn more about how he views humanity.
3,Decent but not great,"It appears the author Simon Hawke doesn't completely understand the Predator's code of honor although he has a decent grasp of it.Hawke should know that the killing of defenseless prey, pregnant women and children is considered dishonorable by the Predator and his people yet he doesn't associate the predators with honor."
3,Better than expected,"After reading the Predator ""film tie-in"" I was not expecting much from this book. Suprisingly,tasty tidbits are revealed about the Predators as certain events are portrayed from the Predator's perspective. Reference is also made to the Predators coming to Earth from the dawn of history to conduct their ""Big Game"". This book also in no way contradicts what we read in the AVP novels. What a pity Simon could not have written the Predator novelisation as well."
5,Intriguing social analysis,"With all the concern about civil liberties and national security, it's important to point out there's special challenges on both sides between leaders who want increased authority for security measures and those who would protect individual privacy in the process. Here's something different: an alternative which suggests American openness is the root of America's ills - but that MORE openness will thwart threats and increase security. Author Bailey is an information technology expert specializing in security and privacy issues: his The Open Society Paradox: Why The 21st Century Calls For More Openness-Not Less makes for intriguing social analysis."
1,Received a different hat than advertised.,"Last year I ordered this hat and loved it, now that it's starting to get worn and old I just bought another.Unfortunately this new hat is not the same. It is not produced by Magic (no Magic tag like the last hat), but instead just has a generic ""Made in China"" tag. The quality of the new hat is terrible, the brim feels like cardboard and the stitching is already frayed. Either I was given the wrong product, or the seller has switched to a new supplier. The new hat I received is similar to the ones pictured, but noticeably different. (The first hat I got matched the pictures.)I will be returning this new hat."
3,It's small but I guess you get what you pay for.,It's small and it's honestly just one size unless you're meant to stretch it stronger than what I've done to it.. Gave it to my younger brother and it fitted him well.
2,Too SMALL,"I normally purchase my fitted caps sized 7 3/4 - 7 5/8, which the product describes this hat to fit. To it's defense, it did fit - as long as I didn't care to have blood circulate to my brain. The style and quality of the hat looks better on the picture than in person. Would've rated 1 star and returned it, but rather than going through the motions of returning it I'd decided to pay it forward to my girlfriend; it fits her ok... not a TOTAL loss (hence the additional star). Perhaps it was meant to be a womens' hat afterall."
1,Unusable...,"Cheap material, got ripped in first 30-sec of use...Poor design regarding adjustment for different head size, will bunch up in the back when adjusted to smaller size..."
4,Handsome hat,Purchasede this hat for both of my sons for Christmas.It runs small to medium and was actually too small for one of my sons but it looked very cute on his wife!
3,Grr,so there is nothing wrong with the hat.. i had got it for someone i worked with and well kind of dont work with that person anymore and we dont talk.. so.. idk whtat to do now xD
4,This is an awesome cap,"I can't stop wearing this hat, and I'm really not that much of a hat person. It's stylish and the service was great."
4,Nice Hat,Another hat to review. It does what it does best. Keeps the elements off your head. I wore this to work to keep the sun out of my eyes while driving and stuff. Does that nicely. Easily thrown into my bag for easy access.
3,"Comfortable hat, but I wouldn't buy it again",This hat is almost what I was looking for. It looks nice and is very comfortable. I will say though that if you have a small head you will not like this hat. I wear hair extensions which make my head a little bigger and this hat is still a little big. When I tried to adjust the hat a little smaller it leaves it bunched in the back which I don't like. I will wear the hat but I wouldn't buy it again.
2,"Nice hat, but doesn't adjust to head size","This is a nice hat, well constructed and very good quality. But the hat is fitted to a very large size. It has a buckle on the back but there is no gap for the band to shorten. When you shorten the band it bunches up the back of the hat and it folds over on itself. It looks like the designer, took a fitted hat and added a strap to it. It doesn't work and I had to return it."
3,It's cool,"The Amazon service was excellent. Quick and efficient. Unfortunately, the cap was way too small for me, and couldn't be adjusted large enough to fit, so I had to return it. Again, the Amazon service was great."
1,Terrible,"""All size fits most"" is more like: ""It will be too big, no matter what"". The stupid adjuster strap fell off by the seams. I mean, the stitches literally fell off. 20 bucks for some crap hat. Never again."
3,Not tier 1 concertos,"First I recommend you get all 69 piano, violin, and cello concertos in the Hyperion set. Where else are you going to hear these obscure concertos? Most are pleasant, some mediocre, and a few hidden masterpieces. Neither of these are masterpieces but I would not consider them mediocre either. The Huss concerto has some pleasant shimmering moments while the Schelling concerto with some Amerucan folk tunes embedded is reminiscent of something Ives would write. Worth a listen."
3,Misleading production date,"While Castro's book was useful when first published in the early 1990s, showing only the reprint date of 2011 is misleading. This book contains dated data and concepts which have been surpassed by more recent books on the subject. Please show the copyright date in lieu of the reprint date or show the both if you wish."
3,It works pretty well,It's generally fine. I did have a problem with one of the the keystone inserts popping out as I plugged in a cable. Hard to know which is to blame.
1,not what it looks like,"The piccolo is said to have 22k gold in the design, so I was expecting something really nice to look at, at least. There was absolutely NO 22k gold in the design anywhere and the design itself was something you would think to see on a child's toy.. Which is more what this piccolo looks like. It is not attractive in any way, so I returned it immediately. Along with that, ""I played the flute for 4 years"", this instrument was not comfortable to hold and try to play. It should have been a plastic toy, that is what it looks like and feels like in your hands. If it had not have been glass, I would have given it to a neighbors child."
1,Crappy childs toy,this was bought because i thought it would be nice to play at the renaissance festival. it now sits in its box doing nothing because i was told i couldnt return it. it doesnt even play right. you can barely get a sound out of it and i am a professional Flutist/piccolistfor the price you pay its rediculous.
2,Hubble,"Even though the pictures were very good, Was very disappointed that there was no audio. An expert astronomer would be OK but at my level, I was lost on most of the images."
2,Careful - play the trailer before renting this!,"I am changing this review to be more helpful. I gave it two stars because the text blurb didn't explain that this is a slideshow set to music, not a true movie.WATCH THE TRAILER and see if you like it.If you watch it on Instant Video, you'll need to let the high resolution kick in (which usually takes a minute or so), or it will look terrible."
2,a slide show,"We are very interested in outer space and would have appreciated commentary instead of ""mood music"". This was nothing more than a slide show. A cheap way to sell pictures of the Hubble spacecraft."
2,Nothing but pictures and music,"This video is only pictures of space with music playing. Some of the pictures have a caption saying what galaxy or nebula it is but that's it. I did not watch the whole thing, I got bored after ten minutes. The shots from the Hubble telescope are cool. The picture quality was not great and it didn't fill the width of mymonitor. Maybe after ten minutes of music there is a narrator but I doubt it. These shots would make a cool screen saver."
5,"Great ""not smart"" movie.","Great movie. We had rented it and decided to get if for Christmas. It's not a smart movie, it's definitely a comedy, but if you're looking for something to put a smile on your face, this is it... I would say it's a movie for 18-30ish year-olds... you might think it's just plain stupid if you're older and enjoy more intelectual/drama type movies."
2,just depressing,"As much as I liked the actors, I found this story just totally depressing and totally un-funny. No idea why this was such a big hit."
4,"Finding Jason Segel,Russell Brand","This is a better than average movie,but sometimes givingus more than we want to know about the sex life of someof the actors.I had seen some of Segels other movies,but nevernoticed him that much. This is/could be a star making film for him.He reminds me of a young Tom Hanks.This movie is really about Peter[ Jason Segel ] finding love,with a fair amount of comedy alongthe way.Also ,I,like many Americans,am just discovering comedian,talk show host Russell Brand [here he plays rock star ElvisSnow]and he is a delight to watch.The video has bonus features,which are interesting,except forthe extended commentary,which is more like an extended egotrip for the actors involved!I like it when the producer/directordoes the commentary."
4,awesome...,"I was completely amazed I got this on the day it came out when I pre-ordered it and was very happy about it, but had one problem was that the security sticker that holds the movie together, the top one that has the title on it, had covered the display case and dvd cover so thus when I was removing it it had ripped a little, some of my DVD's have recently done that and it's getting a bit annoying..."
4,EXTREMELY FUNNY!!!,"I thought this was a very funny and raunchy movie! Everybody did an awesome job! Peter becomes depressed after his celebrity girlfriend, Sarah Marshall dumps him. Peter's friends tell him to forget her and take a vacation to Hawaii. After he gets there, he runs into Sarah and her new boyfriend. Peter becomes even more depressed, until he falls in love with the sexy beautiful receptionist named Rachel. Later, when Sarah's new boyfriend dumps her, she wants Peter back, but he's over her. Somehow, she manages to seduce him for a little bit, but he feels guilty about it, so he tells Rachel. After Peter goes back home, he works more on his musical Dracula puppet play. After the show, Rachel forgives him. you love romantic comedies, you'll love FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL!!!"
4,Surprisingly good.,"When I saw the price, I was worried this might have some issues, but I was pleasantly surprised. On its surface this movie is a romantic comedy, which worried me, but I heard good things about it from friends so I picked it up; adding this movie and getting free super-saver shipping was the same cost as paying for standard shipping, so why not. While the jokes weren't as constantly flowing as I'd hoped, the narrative actually hit home, and there were a few well-played laugh out loud moments."
3,wasn't the movie supposed to be funny?,"because it wasn't. i kept hearing about Forgetting about Sarah Marshall and how funny it was, but wow...this movie a huge disapointment.the only thing that made this movie watchable was the beautiful, Mila Kunis (That 70's Show).other than that, the film was terrible.Story revolves around Peter, a background music composer who is the boyfriend of Sarah Marshall, the star of Crime Scenes Investigation, a hit primetime show. Sarah breaks up with Peter because she is going out with Aldous Snow, a hip hop British pop star.to get his mind of Sarah, he takes a vacation to Hawaii only to find out that Sarah is there with her new boyfriend. Peter meets Rachel (Mila Kunis) and struggles with getting over Sarah, dealing with her hippy cool boyfriend, and his new found feelings for Rachel.overall, the movie wasn't funny, it had it's moments, but nothing great. again, the only thing that made the movie watchable was Mila Kunis."
2,I am forgetting Sarah Marshall...............,"The film was in blu-ray, so it was a nice sharp picture. I did not like this film, had to firce myself to finish watching. SORRY....."
2,Same as every movie in this genre,"It's not the worst movie ever made, but it wasn't worth my time to even finish, though I think I got close. If you are 13 years old and have never seen movies like There's Something About Mary or other movies in this genre then I can imagine this might be an amazingly funny movie. Otherwise, don't waste your time."
4,It was OK,"Ive heard this movie was super funny for awhile from various friends and family, so i finally rented it, sure it was OK."
1,a total scam,"I bought this looking for the free Mp3s. It said details were inside, but all that was inside was the movie, so i looked on the menu, and no way to get them. So unless I'm missing something, there are NO mp3s."
3,Forgetting Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"I admit it .. I generally don't like romance comedies, and this was up there with the average romance comedy.I watched because I wanted to see Russell Brand and he just about saves the movie from being boring.Some entertaining comical bits that made me snigger, but the characters on the whole were just bland. I could not find any emotion towards any of them, except Brand's (nice, but naive) pop star role.If you like romance comedy, you might like this .."
4,Definitely worth it!,Great movie and the extras on this are hilarious! Definetely worth the extra few bucks to get this version instead of the one without all of the extras.
1,I guess my expectations were too high...,"I might not be Jason Segel's biggest fan, but in this movie I have to say he was just a bore. Felt like slapping him quite a few times... And don't get me started on Russell Brand: he's so annoying...Having stayed at the Turtle Bay and loving Hawai'i, I was looking forward to enjoying the nice scenery of the North Shore... Well, this could have been filmed in Santa Monica...Not worth your dollars!"
2,Swingers lite......,"I gave this film two stars because every twenty minutes or so something mildly amusing happens. It does, however, remind you of a much funnier and better written picture known as ""Swingers"" starring a young Vince Vaughn and John Favreahgytrheoue (spelling?). A mopey guy gets dumped by a selfish woman who then wants him back when she finds out he's happy again. Ho hum, been there seen that. Nudity is thrown in for desperate attempts at laughs from the fourteen-year-old crowd...""hahahaha did you see the guy from how I met ur mother's butt??? That's freakin hilarious!!!"" Then for good measure they toss in a half hour vampire puppet opera. Yes, it is true. I would best describe this film as weak barely passable entertainment perhaps during a blizzard. Enjoy."
3,Forget watching this film more than once,"There are some funny scenes in this film but not worth the great reviews I've read and heard about.Jason Segel is original,and has a great future in movies,but I can't understand what all the hype was about.This movie drags alot,and you know whats going to happen next."
4,"Ok Movie, Funny, it's basically for girls :)","As A dude, It made me laugh a little, but I am not into Romance-Comedy or ""Bromance"" and I thought nonetheless it had it's moments, Was funny, would I buy it ? No. But that's me, my opinion. I would recommend to watch first and then decide for yourself.Paul Rudd Was Funny, as was the Main Character. I love Mila."
2,Was this a comedy?,This movie was not what I had expected from all the actors and contributors. There was no one in the movie you really cared about in the end as they all disppoint. And a dracula puppet opera - really???
5,Ahhhhh MILA!!!,"I've loved Mila since the early days of ""THAT 70s SHOW""... She's one beautiful and truly funny girl!!! She really shows what she can do in this movie.. the full range from serious to hilarious!!! The rest of the cast is great, too.. I wasn't a fan of russle brand after the jerk he made of himself on the VMA's (or whatever the awards sho he hosted); but he really was funny here... Segal and Bell were great at their parts too... But back to MILA: SUPERB!! I hope she gets more opportunities to show her stuff!!"
2,Forget this movie,"Cliches. Formula script. Cringe-worthy film about young people who do not have to work (well, they are all highly paid professionals!)The biggest laugh: A fat, dorky mainlander goes to Hawaii and a beautiful girl there falls for him. And that is after a beautiful blonde had fallen for him on the mainland.Oh, Hollywood, and I see you have managed to marginalize the Islanders as waiters, bartenders and flunkies and idiots. As long as they stay out of camera view, huh? More stereotyping and marginalizing by Hollywood."
3,Some Good Laughs,"This romantic comedy provides quite a few laughs and laughable situations, and the acting by the main characters is quite good. Some zany characters with minor roles (Damon the bartender and Kemo) add to the fun. Russell Brand's performance as British hip rocker Aldous Snow enlivens the fun and almost steals the show.The movie lacked something that I can't quite pinpoint, so 3 stars is the best I can give for this one. Most viewers will enjoy this one."
3,Funny Break Up Humor,I thought this movie was pretty funny. It ranks up there with Swingers as one of the really good sad sack guy break up films. It is simply hilarious watching this poor schlub getting his heart broken and dealing with the heart ache that goes along with it.This movie has some pretty funny nudity in it so it is not for the kiddies.
2,Plot was as limp as his ...,"At best the plot was as limp as the star's tool. If you want to see Segel's Eagle then rent the unrated version. Otherwise if you just want a tried and true formulaic boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl plot try this movie without the full frontal male nudity."
1,Forget this movie,"This is part of a long line of crap that began with The 40 Year Old Virgin which made me laugh, then Knocked Up that made me chuckle (slightly), then SuperBad and a few others.If you are a 15 year old boy and are just entering puberty you will laugh. This stuff is getting stupid."
5,Funny movie for a good price.,"If you are looking for a movie to get a few laughs from, and you prefer HD Blu-Ray quality, buy it. You wont regret it."
4,Sarah Marshall Review,"Language (and subtitles): English, Spanish and FrenchWidescreen: 1.85:1Duration: Rated is 1hr 51min. Unrated is 7 minutes longerPackage: 3 Discs, includes deleted scenes, auditions, drunk-o-rama, crime scene, video diaries, gag reel, line-o-rama, extended commentary and a digital copy.Rating: 7.5/10The story revolves around the main male protagonist going through a break up and having his 'recovery' as the main plot. Things get bumpy along the way with a few unexpected surprises. He finds a new romance while his ex-girlfriend's relationship begins to fall apart. There are a few comical scenes thrown in to change the pacing. I would suggest the non-collectors edition if you were to get this dvd, unless you want to get it.WARNING: there's male nudity."
5,HILARIOUS!,"Jason Segel is awesome in I love How I Met Your Mother, and this movie is not exception. This was a great flic, and he did an excellent job writing and acting in it. Russell Brand was hysterical, while Mila Kunis was smoken hot! Be prepared to see some male frontal! ha"
3,Dracula Whines,"Jason Segal is bleeding manhood in a relationship with a successful TV actress. There's the inevitable breakup as she goes off with the daffy British rock star. He takes a vacation to Hawaii to forget her. She and lover boy are in the hotel room next door. You get the picture. He whines, he cries, he finds hotel staff to have fun with. Mila Kunis is so cute for a rebound, so now Jason must find his true self, writing Dracula Opera's. Despite nudity and typical Apatow f-bombs, this comedy is sweet."
2,Not so great,"Very good sub-plot, but the main story was rather trite and unnecessarily crude. I almost gave up on it a few times."
4,Frickin Hilarious,This is a hilarious movie that has a lot of great quotes in it. I think that its one of those underdog movies no one really knows about but it you want a good laugh...you should watch.
4,worth the praise!,"I'm not a fan of Apatow's films, but this was a surprise, it's a great cast, it's funny and isn't unnecessarily long as his other films. What a great surprise! Looking forward to watching all the supplemental material on the three disc dvd edition."
5,"Loved it-great humor, and scenes!","While I generally prefer movies with some substance, this one was a great time.It was funny, relatable,and the comedic timing of all of the characters made the film. Great script writing for a comedy, and I love all of the subplots of the love triangle. Great picture, sound and scenery. Fun date movie, or just a good two hours of laughter! I rooted for the lead character!"
3,"Puppet theater, for the win!","Okay, I didn't really understand or like the bits of the puppet theater you get to see in the movie, but in general I'm a big fan of puppets (Greg the Bunny, the Muppets) and I like the idea. I will also say that since there's full frontal in the unrated version, I'll never be able to watch How I Met Your Mother in quite the same way again... (it was a little odd, too, since his character's name on that show is Marshal).Overall it was entertaining and a little embarrassing, but had a decent (if well-used) plot and it kept me entertained. It's not a movie I'll probably ever watch again, nor will it stick with me, but it was fun while it lasted.If you're looking to kill some time and want something light, fluffy and fun, this is probably as good a choice as any. It's not as sappy as a lot of the romantic comedies out there, nor is it quite as slapstick as a lot of the recent 'funny' movies that have come out."
5,Forgetting Sarah Marshall is too funny!,All I have to say is its very funny and Im buying it payday. HEEEEEEEY
1,Let's follow the formula.,"A mind-numbing, slow jaunt through the life of a recently dumped man -Including jokes that are few and far between and a cheesy plotline that follows a formulaic break-up story we've all seen in the past.The guy gets the girl, imagine that. By the end I just wanted to forget this movie and the lamest musical ever (Dracula musical)."
3,Audio of Being,"This CD is not bad. Not as good as ""Beautiful Midnight"" though. Too bad these guys called it quits."
1,Do NOT buy this!,"Today I purchased a 40 GB ""Flash-Hd to Go"" and have spent the last 3 hours attempting to: 1. load the software (totally un-intuitive experience) ultimately without success; 2. after multiple trial and error attemts, transfer pictures from a 512 MG Fuji Film chip, again without ANY help from the 4 page so-called Users Guide, which transer according to the, again, un intuitive, device screen apppears to have occurred; and 3. transfer the pictures to my Windows XP Professional 240 GB computer, with NO success and NO help from either the laughably inadequate 'Users Guide"" or the manufacturers web page. It has been a frustrating and exasperating experience that I would not wish on any enemy, much less a friend. It goes back to the vendor tomorrow for a full refund.This manufacturer should go out of business, and fast, if its so called Users Guide and Web Page Support are an indication of how it advises its customers on product installation and use!Good Riddance! An afternoon wasted!"
4,Great to see Rush live,"It's always good to see a live Rush video, but this video's production could have been a lot better. The way it was filmed kind of makes me dizzy at times. It almost looks like it was filmed with hand-held cameras. The video is only 90 minutes, so they left off a lot of songs like Mystic Rhythms, Red Lenses, Subdivisions, and Limelight, which were all performed during that tour. On the other hand, it contains a lot of songs that were left off the cd, like Prime Mover, YYZ, La Villa Strangiato, The Spirit Of Radio, and Tom Sawyer. This video would have been better if it was the entire concert and if they used better cameras, but nontheless, any true Rush fan, like myself, will still appreciate this video. Let's just hope the Different Stages video will look a little better. (if it ever gets released)"
4,Great video by progressive rock's finest,"This video is a great sample of Rush live. Most particulary, the performances of ""Force Ten"", ""Territories"", and ""La Villa Strangiato"". In my opinion, the only downside is that it looks like it was recorded with 70's cameras. As far as video production, I prefer the Grace Under Pressure concert, but A Show Of Hands is still a must for any Rush fan."
5,don't be mislead......,"this is part of the 3 part dvd set, so don't buy it if you have that....BUT... it's good!!!Rush smokes.... 5 stars"
1,sad!,After an anxious waiting received the wrong iten and now am asking for my money back.Feel so disapointed since is the first order! :)
3,Could have better picture,I had this as a VHS tape a long time ago and lost it. Was glad to see it out on DVD. Love the song selection. Was disappointed at the video quality. Was dark and did not appear to be cleaned up from its original release.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!,"This is a bootlegged copy in Spanish. The graphics, pictures and language are all wrong! I read everything about this before making this buy for my husband and one day before his birthday I find that I get a Spanish copy in a completely different cover than the orginal. Do not buy from this Totalwhatever company! I'm trying to get my 60.00 back as we speak!"
1,Progressive Power Yoga Trilogy,"I did not like the DVD's at all. You can tell that Mark Blanchard is not a true yogi. I have DVD's by Shiva Rhea,Bryan Kest,Erich Shiffman, Richard Freeman, and David Swenson which are great. If you are currently doing yoga and enjoy it, I would recommend buying one of the DVD's from one of the people above."
4,Good yoga DVD,"Have not had time to review all 3 CDs but what I have seen is good. The format is accessible and not too ""earthy crunchy"". He stresses having fun in the workout and trying vice being hypercritical of oneself. Overall worth the purchase."
1,This guy sucks,"This guy is so into himself and totally misses the point of practicing Yoga. There is no flow to the class and he practically molests the women in his video. Its essentially all about him, how great he thinks he is and how unenlightened he sounds. If those new to Yoga buy this video, they should know that not all Yoga teachers are like this joker.A great instructor is Brian Kest. His voice bothers some people, but at least he generates a positive mental energy that helps all those who take his class go deeper into their Yoga practice. Yoga is not just about having a great body it's about having a strong mind."
3,Not enough flow...,"I have a gazillion yoga DVDs and recently bought these because I wanted a really tough power yoga workout. Well, this disappoints. I had read how tough they were, and there just isn't enough flow to really get your heartrate up and break a sweat. I find Shiva Rea's DVDs to be better overall in getting in a good sweat, even Bryan Kest's and Baron Baptiste's are better than this.I will say that these DVDs have a good balance of postures. You will get some flow (though not enough in my opinion to be a ""power"" DVD), and a nice compliment of standing and stretching poses on the floor. I think most people think these are tough because of all the arm balances, which is great but most people can't do them."
5,We are entering the Throne Room!,"This is the best concert.I enjoyed the backup singers too.And the musicians were great.The lights,camera,stage,and sound was all set up for the concert.Buy this DVD!I guaranteed that it will bless you!!!"
3,Average Performance,As with some of the other DVD's CeeCee does not include some of her more popular selection in this repertoire. The video editing is very good and is a classy product.
2,Keys are not wooden and not in tune,"This is a cute toy, but the one I received has one key way out of tune. I got it for my young son because he loves music and I wanted him to be able to make his own, but teaching young ears with an out-of-tune instrument seems defeating. I will be exchanging this in hopes that it's just a problem with this particular one, since the other keys sound good.Also, this is not a xylophone (with wooden keys), it's a glockenspiel (with metal keys). When the manufacturer says ""wooden,"" they only mean the frame."
5,a non-annoying toy instrument for kids,"I am adverse to noisy toys in my home - maybe I'm just overly sensitive. But when I saw how much fun my kids were having with xyolophones at a friends house, I knew I had to get one for them. I chose this one because I like the style of toys that Schylling makes. When we got the xylophone and my kids went at it, I was pleasantly surprised that the sound it produces is quite pleasant. It's not loud for one thing which is a huge bonus. And the notes are pleasant and not jangly. I haven't tried playing any music on it myself so I can't speak to the musicality of the notes or anything, but it is well made, attractive, pleasant-sounding and my kids have had fun with it. The one tiny negative feedback I would give is that I would have preferred a symmetrical shaped toy which is easier for putting away. But really that's just a personal thing. Wonderful toy!"
5,Great toy,"Great size for my three year old. It is easy for her to hold and carry around. I like that it also has the scale/notes on each of the ""keys"" so that as she becomes more proficient in music she'll be able to recogonize the tones."
3,Fine as Introductory Instrument,"This glockenspiel is cute and colorful and my son enjoys pounding on it for a few minutes. I think I play with it more than he does. But it's definitely a toy, and not really a musical instrument. For the price, I wasn't expecting it to be perfect, but the high b and c keys have the exact same sound. So you are really only getting 7 keys, not 8. I don't really mind too much, since it's not a wallet-buster or anything. But if you shop around, there is probably a better-quality toy instrument to spend your money on."
2,Horribly out of tune,"I bought this for my two-year-old to play with. While I was not expecting it to be anything more than a toy instrument, it is so horribly out of tune, that it doesn't sound like anything musical. Educational Planet has been helpful to date, and I am hoping to return for a refund and seek out another toy."
4,A Great Mix,"I keep this book in my kitchen. I do so because I often use it for the biscuit recipe and also when I'm making out my food shopping list and I need ideas on what to cook. I also read this book while I'm in my kitchen ""watching a pan"". The stories in this book are most entertaining and help the time fly by. It's not the best soul food cookbook I've ever owned (that would be Patti Labelle's cookbook), but it is certainly in the top five. Especially for the new soul food cook, this book is a good investment."
4,Food and Nostalgia,Good book! Many of the recipes are excellent a few are too bare to try. Format is endearing quick comments from members on the importance of the recipe in celebrations and thier life momments.The Black Walnut Poundcake recipe has never let me down-Try it you will LOVE it!.
2,Lousy adn disappointing...,Save your money. The best thing about this cookbook is the cover. It could have been waaaaaay better.
2,"Not Soul Food, Not Real Food.","What a disappointment!I was expecting real food and soul food, and what I got was a book of recipes that women generally inflict on each other at pot-luck affairs.In the history of the World no real food has ever been cooked or served for a pot-luck meal. What happens is the woman has to contribute something so she looks thru her cupboard for stuff no one in her family will eat. Like canned lima beans and pickled beets and anchovies. So she tosses everything into one pot, boils it, pours the goo into a casserole, and takes it to the pot-luck. The book oughta be called Pot Luck Recipes to Inflict On Your Work Associates."
5,VILLIKON makes the Ten Commandments look like a child's read,"So what exactly is The Villikon Chronicles, you might ask? It's the story of Captain Kort Villikon, a respected soldier and military commander who is framed for the horrendous crime of genocide. His punishment is to be banished to the prison world of Itasca. A world swarming with warmongering clans, pirates, and a vampirical race known as the Porphyrian Hive. Through it all, Villikon learns how to survive in this hostile world and seek a way to escape it so that he may extract vengeance upon those who framed him.That description barely touches the surface of this story. Even though the first storyline is over, the chronicles have only begun. In the days to come, The Villikon Chronicles II: Rites of Abolition will be coming out, along with The Crucible of Mystere. In addition, Bryan J. Kinnaird is still working at turning Villikon into a movie or TV series. This is the sort of tale that makes the Ten Commandments look like a child's read."
3,Good repertoire but some too fast tempi,"Stanford wrote some great church music, but the tempos are too rushed in places on this CD. For example, I felt that the beauty and magnificence of the Magnificant of ""Stanford in B-flat"" were lost because of the fast tempo. To me the tempo felt much too modern."
4,Buy it if you like synth,"Great album. Not perfect, but a must for synthpop lovers. Start with the prior album too."
4,The beginning of the scientific revolution,"Lattis' biography of Christoph Clavius tells the story of a man once well-known and influential in science, although virtually unknown today. It tells about the birth of modern mathematics and astronomy. And it tells about how medieval and modern attitutes collided in around the time of the birth of the scientific revolution.The book appears well-researched, it has numerous footnotes, and I felt that it gave a good description of an interesting period, an attitude and an environment. I recommend it for those who what to know more about the period of the birth of modern science, and in particular to those who want to know more about the views of those that opposed Copericus, Kepler and Galileo."
3,e-Everything!,"The book was published in April 2000, which means it was probably written during late 1999 and early 2000, when the NASDAQ was soaring to 5000 and tech had no boundaries. Its tone of breathless enthusiasm is very representative of that time. The book does accurately state the e-potential, but like NASDAQ investors in March 2000 did, it extrapolates unsustainable trends into a ceaseless upswing. The Web is here, and it is a true revolution, but ultimately it is simply another communication channel for insurers and their stakeholders. This is a great read, but only to help understand what kind of carried-away thinking created the tech bubble."
4,this book is fun to read and super-informative,"I really liked this book. I don't think anyone can read it without wanting to make a zine of their very own. I've been zining and e-zining for about 5 years now, and most of this stuff I had to learn on my own. It's great that a book is out now to help people get started and show people what's going on with other zines."
2,William Shatners Not So Good First Attempt.,Not very captivating... unless you know alot about Houdini
3,"Beautiful product, poorly made","I love the bracelet and their cause however, the stars fell off after only a few times wearing it."
2,Science of Discworld II,"I was surprised by the departure from the typical narrative of Terry Pratchett who I love so much. I realize that he expresses certain views on religion and evolution that are creatively couched in his Discworld novels, but this book seemed to be a more aggressive indoctrination of those ideals, possibly made more so by the co-authors. Also in the paperback form I must say the font type and size were difficult to read. All in all not as enjoyable as his other Discworld works."
2,A Pratchett Disappointment,"I was expecting the tongue-in-cheek humor of Pratchett, and this is predominently a history of Creationism versus Evolution, not very funny at all, huh? You'll be disappointed, probably not bad if you are keenly interested in the topic, but a real disappointment to Diskworld fans."
3,Even adulterated Pratchett is worth reading,"Parts are similar to Gould's essays on the history of the development of evolutionary theory, parts are similar to scientific/philosophical works like Godel/Escher/Bach, and parts are a poor Discworld novel. All in all, readable, but nothing classic. I might force my kids to read this when they get old enough."
4,"The ""Globe"" series","i found the second book in this series by accident and read it first without realising it was part of a series of 3. Now that I have read the other 2, I would advise others to read them in order! Pratchett fans will love the brilliant craziness of the Magicians on Discworld - linking their doings and un-doings to real science is great as this makes it both palatable and (mostly) more understandable. Be warned though that the real sceince bits are not just ""popular science"" they are really real and sometimes difficult in the extreme. Anyone interested or a fan of Darwin's will love this book, especially the gentle digs at his similarity (in looks) to the Wizards!"
4,The Science of Discworld III: Darwin's Watch,"As one of the authors, I must confess bias. This one addresses Darwin's life, from a Discworld viewpoint (for the Darwin year).... On Roundworld. the Rev Charles Darwin writes a very successful book, but the wrong one: Theology of Species. The Discworld wizards have to sort out this issue, make him get on to the Beagle, introduce him the the Discworld God of Evolution, etc., and are finally successful!! Not as good as No II, The Globe, in my view, but pretty dam good all the same!"
4,Much better than expected,"I had avoided these books because I didn't think they would fit into the Discworld canon, and I thought that involving other authors would be a bad idea.I was 50% right. These books should not be taken as part of the Discworld universe, but rather a Terry Pratchett spun science story loosely attached to his normal world. Darwin's watch is great reading, and funny in parts, and there are certainly some amazing science to the book.The only downside is that some of the science can get a bit waffley, and that the humor overall is not nearly as strong as usual."
5,Great Video,"Like someone else said, my 5 month old daughter will immediately stop whatever she's doing when she hears the music from this DVD starting. She's glued to the screen for the entire 27 minutes of the show. The first time I put it on for her, she got fussy after about 7 minutes. The next time after about 10. Then she started sitting through the whole DVD. She loves it! I really wish I could find another video that would hold her attention the way this one does, as she's wearing this one out. Baby Mozart was good, but not as good as Baby Beethoven. It's by far my daughter's favorite DVD."
3,Not as good as Baby Mozart or Baby Bach,"I have a 6 month old & my baby loves Baby Mozart and Baby Bach the best out of all the einstein videos. Some are better suited to toddlers, but in the infant category I'd have to say that Mozart and Bach are the best. Beethoven is good too but the value of listing the name etc of each concerto is lost on an infant or even a toddler (event the parent who it is probably really intended for). Her attention was much better kept with the other videos."
2,Not so Good,"The timing for the video content is off and doesn't match the music, the music is good and well-played but arranged to the point that whole movements that are originally 10 minutes long are only like 2 minutes in the video and we foud that frustrating since we listen to Beethoven un-arranged regularly. I also noticed that there was a lot of silent time in this particular video or times at which music is played but it isn't anything I've heard that was composed by Beethoven or, well, maybe it was but edited so to be simplified that it was no longer recognizable. My child may be only 6 mos but he recognizes good music when he hears it having been exposed to it from the time he was in the womb and since and this video didn't catch his interest at all. The BE Mozart music is good though so if you're looking for a video with good music do that one or the Wordsmouth...altogether, though, I recommend just buying the c.d.s and not the composer vids."
2,boring,"I purchased Vol. 1 which is a series of 6 Baby Einstein DVDs (Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Neptune, World Animals, Neighborhood Animals)for my baby when she was a newborn. She is now 17 months old, and she has never cared for any of them EXCEPT for the Neighborhood Animals DVD which depicts scenes of familiar animals like cows, horses, cats, dogs, etc. She really loves the part when they sing ""Old MacDonald"". Baby Beethoven is boring except for towards the end when they show some scenes with real babies which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. I think overall the Baby Einstein series is overrated."
5,Another fantastic Baby Einstein,"My husband and I have almost all of these for our children and love them, because they keep the children preoccupied. The woman who created them deserves a nobel prize."
2,Useless content,"OK, I'll admit that my 3-month-old son loves this video, but he pretty much loves anything that comes up on the TV (like most babies his age). As a mother, however, I am very disappointed with the content. Sure, the music may be stimulating, but this video teaches my son NOTHING. I prefer other children's videos that incorporate counting and colors and even other languages along with the stimulating music. (The original Baby Einstein does this, but it is very poor in quality). And I'm not the type of mom who uses videos as babysitters - I like to sit with my son and watch with him, pointing out different concepts as we go along. Needless to say, I'm bored stiff watching this video - all I can say to my son is ""oh - another spinning toy!"" I'm not impressed, and I'm very surprised what big sellers these videos are. I could make one at home!!"
1,Disappointed with the quality of music,"I am very disappointed with the quality of the recording on this video. The selections of music is wonderful, it is some of Beethoven's best composing. However, the video does a great diservice to you the listener by not including recordings of real instruments. Computers and synthesizers are used to perform the music. The recording of the Ninth Symphony has to be one of the most unmusical renditions I've EVER heard.If you want to expose your child to quality music, buy actual recordings not this."
1,Forget it!,"I can't believe this product would even get a 1 star rating. There are much better learning videos out there that are better than this one. I wouldn't waste my money or my daughter's time watching it. My 20 month old was completely bored! Please parents, don't just buy the status quo, dig deeper. There are better (hard to find), but available products out there. Your child is worth it!"
3,We liked Baby Mozart better!,"This was OK, but my 1 yr. old much prefers Baby Mozart. This one doesn't hold her attention quite as well as Baby Mozart. But, it still is a good video!"
4,Not as good as Baby Mozart,"I absolutely love the Baby Mozart dvd, and so does my son. I decided to get this as well and it is not as entertaining, but good to have for variety."
5,The Best!,These DVDs are the best. My daughter loves them all. Would recommend to others! The pictures and music are beautiful!
4,Great for the Mind,This is one of my son's first video and he still loves it. I see him doing things and saying things he learned from the video. It's awesome to see how fast they pick up on things that they see. It really makes there little minds work. I would get this as a gift for any first time mom or for any mom really
2,Not as good as the others,"This is my most recent purchase of the Baby Einstein series, we have all of them! I must say, I was a little disappointed in the sound quality of this video. The toys are better and my son seems happy that he recognizes some of the toys that he has at home. However, if you try to turn the volume up, it sounds terrible (and I do not mean turning the volume up high). Maybe I just have a faulty tape, but I was not as happy with this one."
4,Toddler loved it,"My 15 month old daughter was enraptured by this DVD from the first time I put it on. The format is great and it's a very charming package. I have to say this was the first time I have danced to Fur Elise! Appears to be a very attractive program for this age range and I would highly recommend it. The main piece is only about 30 minutes long, but there is an auto play feature which allows it to be continuously repeated.On the downside there is a LOT of preamble to the actual program and she gets bored waiting for that to be over with, even the bits you can fast forward through, and the blackout spots between the special features are unusually long for any DVD let alone a children's program. Wasn't particularly impressed with the special features - the puppet shows are just short pieces lifted straight out of the main program, and the flash card pictures aren't all very illustrative for the age group the DVD is intended for."
5,Astounding!!!!!!!!,"Since receiving this product, my baby girl has been mezmerized by the DVD from the first time she watched it at 4 months. As a mom, I love the music (it doesn't get better than Beethoven!), the used of shapes, colors, and characters in the Baby Einstein series, as well as the fact that it provides a great opportunity for my baby and I to interact TOGETHER along with the DVD talking about what we see and learning new things each time we watch it. It's fascinating to watch, even for me as an adult! I'm so very glad we got it!!!"
3,"Simplistic, good for entertaining child","I am not an advocate of parking a child of any age in front of the television. However, there are just those times where nothing else is working and you have to get a shower, cook dinner, take a breather...you know the drill if you are a parent. This dvd is good for that purpose. It has lots of motion, colors and contrasts that attract the attention of an infant+. My 4 month old enjoys watching it, and already has his favorite portions. However, he bores quickly and I think has already figured out the sequence.The dvd is a series of simplistic puppets, colors, moving objects and pictures of children/babies put to classical music. It is designed to entertain a child, not educate them. Some of the review were disappointed in the lack of ""educational"" experience. No, this is not going to prepare your child to read at age 6 mos. It is going to encourage them to be a baby and be entranced by color and motion."
4,Just what mom and dad would do,"My 2.5 month old son loves this DVD. It's basically a bunch of toys for baby to look at, just like having Mom or Dad use toys in front of baby (and he probably doesn't know the difference at this age). The toys are pretty cool and are not ones that you probably already use with baby at home. My son's favorite part is when they show other babies. My daughter was not as fond of this video when she was his age - I have a feeling whether or not baby likes these shows depend somewhat on baby's personality. She was just not as interested in moving objects, and the music wasn't interesting enough to catch her attention either."
4,"Better than ""Baby Mozart""","""Baby Beethoven"" is a better title than ""Baby Mozart,"" but my daughter's favorite DVD now is ""Singing Babies Nursery Rhyme Time."" Classical music is fine, but I wanted my girl to know all the classic nursery rhymes that I grew up knowing. ""Singing Babies"" has gotten her making sounds and clapping. I am very impressed."
3,torn about this product.,"Personally, I do not understand all the hype about Baby Einstein. I expected a lot more from these videos considering the strong reviews and the price. Personally I think these videos are creepy and weird, and resemble brain-washing videos but for babies. The images are cheap looking and the music matches. It's basically the brainchild of one woman whose husband as near as I can gather is the videographer and they feature their own two girls in the movies. Then Disney decided to back them and the aforementioned women never fails to endorse more of her products throughout the film. What a cash cow. Having said that, my 17-month-old does actually enjoy these videos, and there are certainly worse sounds to have in the background than these movies. Had I known what I was actually purchasing, I would have tried to find something else. But since they do hold my toddler's attention they're not a total loss."
3,My Baby Boy Prefers Another Video.,"My 13 month old boy didn't sit still for this one. I've tried three separate times now. The only videos that seems to rivet him to the set are ""Singing Babies Nursery Rhyme Time"" and ""Singing Babies Toddler Tunes."" I think it's because they feature real baby faces that appear to sing the nursery rhymes. This definitely intrigues him enough for multiple viewings at a time!!! So, if you have to get a Baby Einstein product, check out ""Baby Mozart"" over this one. But if you want a slam dunk with the little ones, try ""Singing Babies."""
1,save your money and make your own,"Why people like Baby Einstein dvds is beyond me. Do yourself a favor, buy a camcorder, a pair of socks for hand puppets and make your own. these were clearly made in someone's basement, horrible horrible dvds. We bought the set and only opened 3, now it just takes up space. there are much better dvds out there."
1,There is always one in the crowd...,"I should start by explaining that in our household have numerous Baby Einstein videos --Mozart, both Dolittle's, Shakespeare, Van Gogh-- which we adore and watch nearly every day. My 2.5 year old and 10 month old both love the music and the whimsical puppets, etc.THAT SAID, my 10 month old (who was 7 at the original time of purchase) can not stand to watch the Baby Beethoven video. He bursts into tears every time I have tried to show it to him. (I've tried different points on the tape.)I have no idea why this should be so (music too somber? puppets too scary?) but I thought I should warn those who were making their first purchase to try any of the other videos.Pam T~"
2,"Roll over, Beethoven! insipid electronica commercial crap","Wow.You're considering paying $15 for a 30-minute long commerical of toys operating (oh, and look, you can order these toys, conveniently, from our website) and some really, really lame puppetry, and some shots of kids banging around on aforementioned toys (oh, and look, you can order these toys, conveniently, from our website--sic), and some of the most passionless, artless music I have ever heard. Please reconsider.Yes, it might keep your small child interested for a while, but there are much better ways to spend your money if that is what you want. (My small children are wildly entertained by ripping up toilet paper, for instance--for this price, you can buy a lot of toilet paper) If you want your kid to like Beethoven, why not buy them an actual CD of an actual orchestra playing actual music? I found this DVD incredibly dissapointing."
1,Rinky dink video,"My child was not interested in this video at all! The way in which the information was disseminated in the video is no better than what I give to my child just sitting in front of him with flash cards or a book. And the silly theatrics of the video are horrible, my point, this video is garbage!"
1,be ware,"I ordered this item on saturday and even though they say it is available, I am not going to get it until after Christmas. I can't cancell it and I can't get a response back from Customer Service!"
5,Fast & Affordable,"100% satisfied. I was able to find what I wanted quickly, the vendor emailed me a confirmation of my order right away, it came on time, and was in perfect condition. I appreciated being able to use this vendor and not having to pay four times the amount at my local technology store."
4,"Musician approved, but Baby Mozart is still the best","I'm a classically trained pianist, so I'm the biggest skeptic when it comes to bad, baby-ized music. However, Baby Beethoven, Bach, and Mozart seem to stay true to the melody and harmony of the original music. The re-orchestrations must be very friendly to baby ears, and it is beautifully done. It simply makes some of the scary, bigger sounds more palatable for baby. This was a good basic introduction to Beethoven for a baby-- a nice long segment of Ode to Joy, 9th Symphony, and Fur Elise.The synchronized images may look silly and dumb to an adult, but try to remember who the audience is! This DVD holds my baby's attention, and that is what matters.There isn't supposed to be a storyline, so I can't judge on randomness. Nonetheless, the transitions are not as seamless as Baby Mozart, and there are many more parts in Baby Beethoven that are music-free and slightly awkward."
4,Baby Einstein - Baby Beethoven - Symphony of Fun,"My baby love it. However, they use the same image than in previous DVD. If you have any of they DVD, you don't need it."
4,Love Baby Einstein,"My son loves Baby Einstein, however, this is not his favorite video...Not bad, but a little less active than some of the others."
5,Baby Beethoven: Symphony of Fun DVD,"My daughter LOVES Baby Beethoven. We first put it on when she was 2 months old and she has loved it ever since. It has been wonderful to have and has helped greatly when she's been crabby but it's too early for bed. All she has to hear is the intro and she gets excited. I think they did an EXCELLENT job of putting in things that keep the attention of an infant. Just remember that every child is different, this works for my child but might not work for yours. I talked so highly about the dvd and bought it for my nephew who is 3 months younger than my daughter but he has no interest in it. Just like everything else with babies, it's trial and error. AND I think this is one that is definately worth trying!"
3,"Nice video, yet old version","The new version comes with a music CD for free, which our baby actually likes more than the video. So if you really want to buy it, look for the newer version that has the cd included..."
5,She loves it so I love it!,"I was introduced to the Baby Einstein collection with Baby Mozart, my 10 month old loved it, so I explored more selections including Baby Beethoven. She is now 1 year old and is still captivated by these videos! I am amazed! I had tried other videos in the past that had been recommended by parenting magazines, none of them kept her attention like the Baby Einstein videos do. My favorite feature of the DVD is the repeat option for those days when I am really needing to get something done I can loop the DVD and my daughter will watch it over not loosing any interest."
1,10 minutes of preview on every dvd you can't fast forward through,Don't buy their crap. There is 10 minutes on every video that you have to watch that you can't fast forward through.
1,Scared my son!!!,"My son loved Baby Mozart right from the start, but he is 8 months old and Baby Bethoven really scared him. At several points in the video, something pops out of nowhere with a scary sound- like a toy spider- and he actually screamed and started crying! It was awful. I am saving the video for when he is hopefully older but just wanted to pass this along for other parents."
5,best product ever,"I can't tell you how wonderful this product is! I have fussy 5 month old twin boys and nothing calms them other than the Baby Einstein videos. These videos will save your sanity if you have a fussy infant. You'll kick yourself that you did not invent this product when you see how simple the images are, but it works."
1,Terrible Video Quality,"I am a parent of 2 small girls and I also own the Baby Mozart, Baby Einstein, and Baby Bach DVD's. Out of all of these Baby Mozart is the better video. The problem I have with this title is the video quality is poor. For example, in one scene there is this toy train that goes around and around, when the Camera pans a certain way, the entire image jiggles as if there was a problem with the camera. I can't believe that Disney would allow a distribution of a product that is so second rate. The poor video quality is not on the other DVDs. I wished I had returned the product. The puppet work in this title is also several notches down in quality compared to the Baby Mozart DVD."
1,What's all the hype?,These videos get rave reviews and I just don't understand it. It is your basic toys videotaped with music. My son watches them but there are better things out there. And I would NOT buy them again or any other videos for the future.
5,The best so far!,"Me and my 28-month-old love this new video! It is refined in so many ways over past releases, such as Baby Bach or Baby Mozart. The puppets are all new, no longer made of wash cloth material, they now look like real puppets and are much cuter. All the toys shown are much more involved with the music. They move better to the music and are in constant motion full of brillant colors and fun shapes. Also the toys used seem to be more up-to-date. The music is exceptional as always. Also there are many more children in this one over the past releases. I really like the cut scenes between the songs, they show bright pictures of animals, much like on the Baby Einstein Flash Cards. This one is as good as Baby Einstein gets. A must have!"
4,mixed bag,"Put love, blackmail, murder and drug smuggling into Ireland and you have a heady mix.A newsman goes seeking his lost love and finds a firebombed news-van.People dying left and right for no apparent reason make the story line strangewith an Irish blackmailer trying to turn a dishonest scaminto big money. A childhood friend of the newsman just happens to be in love with the same girl..."
2,Not really 1800 mAh,From a few weeks testing - this battery holds about half of what the original (NP-95 1800mAh) holds. With a Fujifilm x100 - I can get probably half the shots I would get with the original. Disappointed.
4,TROUBLEMAKERS MAKIN' TROUBLE!!!,"This isn't a grounbreaking CD, and it may not make your heavy rotation list, but for the most part, the Troublemakers' ""Doubts and Convictions"" is a groovy set of downtempo jams with a funk-flava. These guys don't compromise on sophistication and style either. Each song is aural-nirvana! ""Doubts and Convictions"" is perfect for that next soiree you plan."
5,Mojo Magazine-Album of the Month,"The French Revolution in dance music has not yet run its course. This, the debut from Marseille trio Troublemakers. is closer to the easy listening air school than the party time Daft Punk faction: yet it probably has more in common with the vogueish cinematic grooves created by America's Thievery Corporation "" or Austria's Kruder and Dorfmeister than any of their compatriots."
2,A Snooze,"This is just one more disc to join the hordes of disposable downtempo electronica. The music is banal, flat, and frankly, completely forgetable. It's not bad, exactly, it's just boring.Perhaps, for those of you who want something so slow and underwhelming as not to disturb your purple hazed evening, this album may find a place in your stereo. For those of you looking for something engaging, look elsewhere."
5,A hard-to-find French import but worth the hunt!,"Two words....simply magnificent!I first heard of this group whilst sitting in a little Bar Tabac at the bottom of the hill that leads up to Sacre Coeur just before sunset. As the disc started, the background din of bovine tourists faded away and was replaced by the opening track from Express Way. I knew it was love at first listen.Having subsequently tracked down and purchased both ""Doubts & Convictions"" and ""Express Way"" I can confidently say the Troublemkers have become a firm listening favourite during these long summer evenings in Southern California. A perfect compliment to a long day surfing or scuba diving, as one snuggles with that special someone around a gently chilled bottle of Chardonnay."
2,Don't Understand the High Reviews,"I purchased this book based on the customer reviews here on Amazon.com. I do not understand the high reviews. I am still reading the book, but am having trouble continuing. It is boring and confusing--somewhat rambling."
4,"Judging the Past, Present and Futrure","Scott Turrow is a famous lawyer/best selling author. This book is fascinating since it is filled with plots and subplots and characters that are flawed, memorable and engaging. The current controversy about death row and the death penalty makes this book even more timely. The lead characters Larry, Muriel, Arthur and Gillian intertwine in a plot that leaves you guessing until the end. Perfect summer reading. Can't wait for the movie. What's so fascinating is Turrow's grasp at life and death and the present (where it all spirals together). Are you sure about your future, are you set in the past, do you yearn to create a new today. This is the kind of book that although it's a novel is excellent at spawning some soul searching about life and death and what you do for a living. Easy reading even if it's 400 pages-- you can finish it in a weekend or savor it for weeks. He tackles one of the major social issues of our time with vigor."
2,Zzzzzzzz,"This is a tedious book that never seems to take off, populated with characters I had a hard time identifying with. It rockets back and forth over a ten year time span and spawns sub plots and minor characters that confuse more than enlighten.Read his early stuff, it was really good."
1,A TOUR AROUND MY LIVING ROOM,"Ever had a force guided tour around your own living room? It's boring and difficult, but not as bad as this book. Normally I love ST but this was a plot that lost it's way.I dont think that I'm especially dim but I simply lost the plot on so many occassions..who was who? And what was going on? I had to put the book down and read something else..I read two other books whilst I had my breather from this one.The characters were very believable but it was an insult to let them live their lives around such a convoluted and tangled plot. The romance was a relief from the tedium.Better luck next time Scott."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"Having read and enjoyed Presumed Innocent and Burden of Proof, I was looking forward to reading Reversible Errors while I was on vacation. To be succinct, and not waste your time as mine was in reading this book, it stinks. I found myself not caring one way or the other about the characters. They were not developed to the point where I gave a hoot about them. Unlike his other books, the plot was dull and even contrived. From page to page and chapter to chapter I kept waiting for something to grab my interest, but vacation hours later, nothing did. I feel I got cheated out of precious vacation reading time.I'm left with one question, ""Did I spend more time struggling to read this book than he spent writing it?"""
2,Skimmable Book,"I had high expectations for this one. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. After the first half of the book I skimmed alot of pages. It wasn't that it was too wordy. It was just that I didn't care about most of the characters. The defendant on trial is pretty much just a name - we never really get to know him or care one way or the other if he lives or dies.The characters that I did like (Arthur and Gillian) were boring and predictable. Their storyline could and SHOULD really have gone a different way.Susan - why even bring her into the book? Another pity factor for poor, misunderstood Arthur?Murial & Larry - boring. Their relationship was an unnecessary addition to the novel. It did, however, make up the majority of my skimming.The only redeeming factor is the mystery behind who killed the 3 innocent people in the diner.Borrow this book from the library or some poor sap who bought it. It is unworth your hard-earned cash."
2,Disappointing and Unsatisfying,"I found this book to be lacking in many respects- the story of a man wrongly accused and about to be executed has been done enough and there was nothing in this one that justified telling it again. The characters were all either unlikable, depressing or boring. The pace was slow and the writing sub par, and confusing when it didn't have to be. I also found the sex scenes bordering on gross- I'm not really averse to sex in novels (and Turow is more graphic than many writers), but I really didn't want to hear about one of the characters menstruating....it just did nothing for the story.I plodded through this one, but have concluded the only Turow book worth reading is Presumed Innocent."
1,Too Complicated and technical,"This book, unlike his peer novelists, is terribly difficult to get into. I found myself constantly referring to the characters outlined on the first page. After 110 pages I found myself totally bored and quit....."
1,Below Expectations,"I was very disappointed in this novel,which struck me as falling well short of the author's previous efforts. Although there are some pockets of suspense and bits of compelling narrative, the overall plot seems hackneyed, and the characters underdeveloped. We find none of the intensity, sublety or nuance we've come to expect from Turow. In short, this a potboiler that was truly an effort to read. In fact, my interest faltered, and I didn't care enough about the outcome to read it to the end."
2,A walk in the desert.,"After having read the masterful Presumed Innocent, I was looking were much foreward to getting my teeth into this new novel, but my expectations were, alas, somewhat disappointed. Knowing the writer's oppinion concerning the death penalty - it is not difficult to guess the outcome of the plot. To fill up the pages of the novel, the author throws in the love story of the defender as well as the love story of the procecutor in addition to the defender's mentally ill sister without much relation to the plot at all. After a while it feels like a walk in the desert. You are not much concerned about the characters and you are just waiting to turn the last page of this quite boring story. The best plus to the novel is that the main character is no he-man but only a normal person with faults and errors. Better luck next time!"
2,What a Sad World,"This is the first Scott Turow book I've read, and while I marveled at his ability to write (he has a wonderful way with words), I was amazed at how bleak the world of Scott Turow is. The book is populated with truly unattractive characters...I cannot remember a single really positive one. Reading, one feels sorry for many of the characters, but one is hard-pressed to find a character to really root for--the pages, the scenes, the characters are all filled with cynicism and hopelessness."
4,One of Turow's finest...,"A magnificently written court room drama with a man's life in the hinges. RE gives the reader an insightful look at what it takes to survive as a lawyer, a judge, a detective, and a condemned inmate. His characters come to life with just the right mix of detail so you look into their personality and personal lives like you know them as friends. A great mix of suspense and romance and mental disorder thrown in the normal Turow flair -- and the author's got yet another winning novel. Four stars!!"
2,"More a ""relationship"" book than a legal thriller...","The focus of this book seems to be on the relationsips between the 2 couples (Muriel and Larry, Arthur and Gillian) brought together as a result of the last-ditch death sentence appeal by the convicted killer. The book basically plods along as the 2 couples struggle with their relationships, while breaks in the case gradually unfold. I didn't find the book to be ""riveting"" or ""suspenseful,"" as some other reviewers have claimed. I wouldn't call this a ""bad"" book, but I wouldn't recommend it, either."
2,"Blah. This is a romance novel, not a legal thriller.","This book was borderline Danielle Steele. The legal aspects of the story were secondary to the development of the characters' relationships. The sex scenes were excruciatingly painful to read, and a bit too descriptive. Thought I was reading a legal thriller here. Too much time is wasted on Muriel's and Larry's relationship; it was irritating and unrealistic reading about Muriel's conflicted emotions about whether or not she and Larry shood take it to the next level. I mean, these are forty/fifty-somethings and they're obsessing about the things I used to worry about in college. To add to the frustration, the book's dénouement was bland and totally predictable. Blah, don't bother with this one."
3,Too many pages devoted to characters' love lives,"I was drawn to this novel because it deals with the timely issue of doubt being cast on the guilt of a convict who had actually confessed. The crime/law portion of the story is excellent. But too much of the novel for my taste chronicles the romantic and sexual problems of attorneys and investigators. It's as if Turow found his crime/law plot shaping up as too slim, and had to resort to padding."
5,Worth The Wait!!,"Plain and simple, Reversible Errors is worth the wait. Compelling, intriguing, and a great thriller. I loved it. A must read for lovers of good strong fiction. Also recommend The Gravel Drive by Kirk Martin - a must read for fathers."
2,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT,THIS BOOK WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF READING TIME. THE MOST BORING BOOK THAT GRISHAM HAS EVER WRITTEN. THERE WAS NEVER A MOMENT WHERE I CARED WHAT HAPPENED.
2,Severe disappointment,"I was bored silly by this slow-moving, repetitive piece of junk. Maybe all lawyers write like this?"
3,Good but not engrossing,"I usually avoid stories about the death penalty, but this one looked interesting. It kept my attention, but I was not engrossed in the story, which is my indicator of a great book.The author switches between the perspectives of both sides - the prosecuting attorney and the defense attorney. Because I wasn't totally paying attention, I had a hard time keeping the story lines tied together.It's a good read, but easy to put down after a short time."
4,Homeschoolers and Caring Parents: Here are some great ideas,"Much more than a list of books. Provides you with an accessible way to use these books to help your child retain that natural curiosity and excitement about learning. Great starting point for using non-fiction, ""living books"" in your child's education. The author's Non-Book Report is an excellent idea! Read it and see what you think!"
5,Dallas Observer Review,Here is a link to a review of the album in the Dallas Observer:http://www.dallasobserver.com/1998-04-02/music/out-here/
3,small town quirky characters,"It's interesting to read that professional reviewers call this book hilarious. Although there are comedic characters typical of any small town. This book should not be described as funny. It's an interesting story of the development of a family truely in love - and true to the new century, even in Ireland. And the author takes a twist by bringing in the metaphysical world. It makes for an interesting read - but not necessarity compelling. I think the book would make for a wonderful tv series. I can see all the characters and the setting. It's the next Northern Exposure or Picket Fences."
5,Professional Results!,I used this tool to make several flares. It works great. It's a bit awkward at first holding the die and tubing - but in minutes it was like I used it for years. I like this tool because you can bring the flaring tool to the car. Some of the other higher priced and higher quality flaring tools are set-up in a vice. If you have a brake line snaked through a car you-re pretty much out of luck bringing the brake line to the tool. With this one - you take the tool to the car.I highly recommend it. One short-coming is that it doesn't make 30 degree flare for An and JIC fitting. Oh well.
3,The provided dies are junk for stainless steel,"I use one of these tools on a nearly daily basis at work, and I've found that the 3/16"" dies are junk. This is the only size I use, and when double flaring 3/16"" diameter, .020"" wall, 304L stainless brake tubing, I only get four flares out of a set of dies before they are unusable. They are made of sintered metal, and don't hold up. The tool itself is fantastic, and with decent dies works wonderfully. I just wish Mastercool would fix their problems with the dies."
1,"MasterCool gets 5 stars, shipping gets nothing","The MasterCool tool gets 5 stars all day, shipping was a disaster.. The plastic case was broken in 2 places because of the way it was packaged.. It was thrown in a box (significantly bigger than the tool case) and sent... There were no peanuts, bubble wrap, news paper etc.. This tool is heavy and I'm sure it got a real pounding during shipping... It was sent from another company and not Amazon... Didn't want to deal with the headache of sending it back and decided to keep it..."
1,MasterCrap,"This unit worked good for the first few flares then it was all downhill from there. I am restoring an old cadillac so i had to do at least 24+ flares on multiple sizes of stainless tubing on this vehicle alone. ALL the dies I used for this car are worn out ALREADY.They started chipping immediately.Junk AFTER 1 CAR!!!. Mastercool told me they don't warranty wear even when i told the girl it was one cars worth of flares. The holding dies are chipping where they grab the tube. They appear to be made out of pot metal. This in turn causes the tube to oval and so the flare nut can't slide up to the flare without a hammer!!! Also,the pump handle leaks fluid when under pressure. Almost all the flares LEAK. I have to buy more tubing. Mastercool says go after the seller and the seller says they dont do warranty. Put your money in an old fashioned manual tool. Thats what I'm back to."
5,Flaring has always been so much trouble.,"Now I welcome it! This tool makes it so easy! Totally worth the price, very high quality. I recommend it."
5,Extremely helpful for support in a health crisis,"For 4 months I was going though a health crisis, which could not be identified by the doctors and left me drained, exhausted and very worried. A friend handed me this wonderful book with a guided meditation by Anando Hershley.I started my mornings with relaxing in bed and go into the process of 'The Forgotten language of talking to my body'.This is a wonderful process invented by Osho to connect with the sub-conciousnesshere called 'The Guardian' and to allow the body to take over its own healing process.It connects the healing processes of the body with the mind and spirit. This process worked for me and I highly recommend it."
5,Very helpful,"An excellent book! It is a compilation of parts of Osho's talks. People of today have got out of touch with their own body. Even donkeys know what to eat, what their body needs, what is good for them, but man does not? Osho talks of regaining that intuition, getting friendly with the body, listening to it. Most other books and teachers just give blind rules to follow: eat this, and don't eat that, do so and so, and don't do so and so. But Osho talks of ""listening"" to our body, so that we naturally and spontaneously know what the body needs. The feeling that comes is something to experience.The CD included with this book is one of Osho's Meditative Therapies. I did it after having gone through his active meditations. And I have a *personal opinion* that it will work better after trying active meditations for a while.He answers many questions, about food, health, relaxation...An amazing and incomparable book.."
2,not impressed,"I was not impressed by this. Much of it seems to be just rambling on, not making many good or new points. The writing is very poor and much of it is common sense pointed out as if it is a great revelation."
3,"Amusing, not great","Eskit has some of his current material, anti-conservative political songs & such on this CD. Occasionally moves beyond good taste (see song titles), but this is a voice that I've been missing in the current political climate.I look forward to the next CD, primarily because he's much better in person, and I expect he will improve."
2,It's a disappointment!,"Normally, Hollywood makes a very poor use of talented actors/actresses who have especial gifts, like great singing voices, for example. This is the case of this movie, which presents or introduces an extraordinary talent like Yma Sumac, without giving her the opportunity to show properly the talents she is famous for. I saw the movie just because her name was in it. What a disappointment! She is treated in the movie like a native extra!"
3,Looking for Yma Sumac?,"Let's face it--most people (not all) want to see this, to see the beautiful and extraordinarily talented Yma Sumac. She is included in the cast credits (even touted) yet she is in it all of a few seconds. I agree with the other reviewer, she was featured no more than an any extra. And other than her, the movie isn't so interesting. What is somewhat ironic about this, is that Sumac's only other U.S. film, ""Secret of the Incas"" is not at all interesting except for her parts, as well! In truth, it was she, not Paramount, who decided she would do no more films."
2,Copy has a lot of dropout,This video is in barely fair condition. It was obviously copied from several generations removed from the original. I was not overwhelmed by this product.
2,Disappointed,"This book was not what I was expected. Needless to say, I was a little disappointed. It focused mainly on how to keep your focus away from infidelity. I thought it would be more about strengthening your marriage..."
2,a big fat waste of money!,"i liked ""We Used To Be Friends"" and thought ""Bohemian Like You"" was a lot of fun, so i figured the Dandy Warhols would do something similarly cool with ""Call Me"" and ""Relax."" wrong-o! both covers are flat-out BORING. the words are sung in a droning monotone and the instruments have none of the punch and energy of the originals. they sound like they were recorded for no other reason than to lure in eager fans with the promise of ""exclusive, previously unavailable tracks."" you don't even get the sense that the band LIKES the songs they're covering. the only reason i give it any stars at all is because of tracks 1 and 4, but if you have the albums from which they are pulled, this single is essentially worthless. spend your hard-earned cash elsewhere, this is nothing more than another record company ploy to get you to pay big bucks for an import CD of little value. i got suckered into buying it but you don't have to."
1,Parents Beware: This DVD has lengthy nudity.,"This DVD gives no forwarning of the fact that it has lengthy (approx 2 full minutes) of NON-ANIMATED nudity, featuring a nude woman walking around in an animated room (""Tango""). We are not prudes, we're parents, and it should upset any good parent when their kids are ambushed by porn images. I am glad that my wife and I happened to view this DVD before our little ones did. The only segment which seemed worthwhile is ""Creature Comforts"", which is really funny (but that segment can be had by buying the DVD which goes by that title).We thought all the other segments were boring, flat, or dumb. We sent it back to Amazon(.com)."
1,this is crap,"Don't waste your money. There are 19 shorts:-Four of them are just commercials and who wants to pay money to watch commercilas? They're not even good commercials.-One is a stick drawing from 1968 that is just a guy buying a package from a man a copuple of times-Another one of them is 15 seconds long that shows the MTV logo-Two of them are unfinished and are pointless-And all of them are boring.If you were in a highschool art class you might say ""wow that was pretty good,"" but other than that it is a waste of time."
4,A mixed bag,"-- but the good ones are very good.The disc starts with samples of Plympton's early, student work. That's probably of interest to the hard core Plymptomaniac, but I'm not in that category. I found them missable.Some of the later pieces are outstanding, though. ""Your Face"" is a twisted classic, an non-stop exercise in transformation. ""How to Kiss"" (especially the 'nibbling kiss') and ""25 ways to stop smoking"" are among the more memorable.Plympton's usual style is spare, simple scenes on a blank white background, drawn in colored pencil. Given the amount of computer-generated japanimation around, it's an enoyable change of pace.Don't come to this animation looking for ""Bugs Bunny"" or ""Fantasia."" It's in a different class altogether. If you're ready for a different look, and for some mind-bending takes on everyday events, give it a shot. You might find yourself hooked.//wiredweird"
5,PLEASE re-release or reprint this!!,"I have not seen this DVD, but I have seen almost all of the animated films it contains, and assuming decent video quality, for once, a title with the word ""greatest"" would live up to its name. Balance, Tango, Charade, The Big Snit, Your Face, Technological Threat, and A Greek Tragedy are some of the most eloquent and funny animated films I have ever seen. But at the date of this review, the DVD is unavailable and used copies *start* at $200!Image Entertainment, ***PLEASE*** re-release this disk!!"
4,You either love em or hate em,"You either love these cartoons or you hate them, but I use them when doing lectures or presentations. As examples or parodies, they work well."
5,Warning This Tape doesn't have any works of bill plymptoon on it!!!,"I bought this tape last sunday and I got it today. To the reviews they said that plymptoons would be on it. I watch it the middle I got it and no plymptoons on it.But their was the first Hey Arnold, there was a different in the cartoon they used claymation in the cartoon. Even though there wasn't any plymtoons on it there was great orginal material there. I would give this tape to some-one over the age of 8 because of questionable themes on it,but yet I don't under-stand why this tape is animation for adults stamped on it?Great tape 5/5 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Very unique brand of humour....,"Bill Plympton's works are not for those people who like to see explosion in movies and who like to have distinct, obvious and relatively simple punchlines to their jokes. His brand of humour is subtle, and it seems to appeal to people with real brains to poke at. Very unique trademark animation style. This tape brings together the best and impossibly worst animations of one of animations foremost geniuses. (and even the worst ones are well worth it!) If you like this, try migraine boy! Good all around!"
4,"Some real gems, a couple rocks","This disk has some great material (The Cat Came Back will keep you humming the theme song, Tango is an intricate dance of overlaid images, but the nudity/sex make it very inappropriate for kids, Your Face makes one wonder what Bill Plympton sees in the mirror, and Charade is a scream). The Balance is either a powerful statement on greed or a pretentious attempt to out-Kafka Kafka. The Great Cognito has some good images (MacArthur puffing a mushroom cloud is a chilling reminder of what he wanted to do in Korea), but the story tries too hard to be funny. Sundae in New York I found to be a bore, and Every Child is a preachy guilt-trip. Definitely a keeper."
5,Good Power Ranger Toy,It was an old power ranger my kids did not have so I ordered. it. They like having the whole set.
2,tonka truck,This toy is not loud. It does not make but maybe 3 sounds. Good for filling up and dumping. But my 2 year old was not impressed. He may of played with it 2 or 3 times. Truely not tonkas best toy.
1,A nice-to-have but not worth the money,"I purchased this product in November. Its performance/price ratio is not good. Here is why:1) Customer service is horrible. The phone line is always busy. They don't reply emails.2) The AC adapter can only be used as a charger. i.e. you always have to use the battery3) In my case, the battery can only last about three hours. The manual claims ""up to 10 hours"". Customer service ignored my inquiry.4) When it is recording using the built-in mic, an annoying hard-drive-accessing noise gets recorded every two minutes. In addition, you can not attach a non-powered external mic.5) The FM radio can not give clear sound no matter how hard you tune.What this product is good is it can record voice directly into MP3.I would not recommend the product."
1,Worst piece of equipment I ever had....,Horrible...Pros:1. Sometimes it worked.Cons:1. Terrible battery life. I needed to be charged everyday.2. Horrible Tech support. Email response took 2 days.3. Screws were loose on my device.4. It would randomly turn itself off even on a full battery.5. FM radio was terrible.6. Crystal display is small.7. Menus are VERY hard to navigate too.I will never buy and Archos again. NEVER!
2,New product that still needs a lot of work,"First off, the battery life is horrible... 3-4 hours on a charge. Second, it tends to lock up from time to time, and the only way to get it back to normal is to pop the battery hatch... but if you do that or run the batteries down all the way, it loses all of the radio station presets you've stored. In addition, it only properly recognizes 128 kbps MP3s... if they are recorded at any other bit rate, it can still play them, but the info (length timeplayed, time remaining, etc.) is all wrong. It also takes some learning, as the user guide does not match the product... for example, to make a new directory or delete a file, you have to do an entirely different set of actions than the instruction manual states.This has the potential to be a good product, if Archos fixes a lot of these problems. Most of them can (and probably will) be fixed via firmware updates. But the battery life is a major issue with this player."
3,I Didn't Believe the Reviews,"The very first thing I noticed, was the terrible instruction booklet, it really is the worst I have ever seen, they might as well not give you one and let you figure it out by yourself. Though I have to give them credit for the online instructions, those are great and very easy to understand.The second thing I noticed after I downloaded my music, is that the sound quality was terrible and I had to adjust it with every song.Third, the earphones are the worst, maybe the bad sound quality was due to the earphones, because when I changed them for my sony earphones, the sound quality improved a lot, but I didn't like having to go through many menus to adjust the volume. It's stupid not to have a volume control on the player.In the end, I decided to return it and spring for the Ipod."
1,Dont do business with JR Music World,"Don't do business with JR Music World, they sent me a crap product. Ear out input did not work!"
5,Punk with a great metal edge,"When i first heard that Sum 41 was coming out with a new cd, i didnt think it would amount to anything special, while All Killer No Filler had some great songs, it seemed to lack something, but then i heard Still waiting and to say the least it blew away all the preconceptions of what i had thought of sum 41. i am mostly a fan of thrash metal(Metallica, Pantera, Slayer and the like) and punk/melodic hardcore(Pennywise Black Flag,Bad Religion, Misfits) and Does This Look Infected gives a very nice medium of both and it blew me away, i couldnt stop listening to it for the longest time, I would have to say that this cd blows all pop-punk(also a lot of other punk) right out of the water, sum 41 have added a whole other side to their music and it is truly incredible. If you can just look past the pretensions of what you know about sum 41 and give this album a try, i guarantee you will enjoy it just the way that i have"
5,Awesome cd! Recommended to those whose like fast paced punk!,"I heard the fourth song ""still waiting"" on mtv and decided to check this out. I had a their last cd and didn't like it that much. But this one is much better. Almost every song on this cd I like. I have to give sum 41 a pat on the back. They kick ... in this cd. I recommend it to everyone who likes the fast paced rock music."
5,"This is the best sum41 cd yet,","Does this look infected is the best sum41 cd out there. There are alot of critics and other people saying some not so nice things about sum41, but I think that even if they heard the cd they'd think it was good. The solo's on the cd are amazing, and the lyrics are really deep. A.N.I.C is a song that isn't so deep, but its still fun to listen to. The cd does have a harder sound, but that doesn't mean that the band has changed. They said that on this cd they matured alot, and you can tell not only by the lyrics but also just by the different style they are playing that they have. I think that anyone, even if your not a fan, should get the cd. - Billi"
1,Wow you people need to learn how to spell....,"First off this band sucks, not punk, not alternative, its...POP. This band is another reason to blame canada. Anyways, don't buy this album, buy some decent music like The dillinger escape plan, or minor threat, or the dead kennedys."
4,Big Improvement,"""Does This Look Infected?"" is a big improvement form their last CD ""All Killer No Filler"". While AKNF was just like any other pop-punk album, DTLI incorporates metal, and skate punk into the songs. Everything is better on this CD than the other one. The vocals aren't whiney, and there is some pretty cool guitar riffs and solos. The lyrics were pretty good. Nothing special though. I would compare their sound NOFX or Pennywise. Hopefully, on their new CD which is coming out October 12th, they will continue to improve and try to earn the pop-punk genre some respect."
5,best cd ever,sum 41's new cd Does this look infected? is the best cd ever. it has the coolest songs and the best lyrics. sum 41 is the best band ever. the song still waiting is awesome. if you dont have the cd yet you had better get it soon because it is sure to sell out fast.
1,I really like this band coughsuckscough,"This is the punkiest punky punk band to ever punk out on the punk world. punk was dead until they came along, the punky punks of sum 41. Punk out all you punky punks!"
1,BETTER THAN THE FIRST!!!,"but they still stink. Poseur sellout whinet pop-rock group who are wannabe punks. These guys stink, but you MTV kids wouldn't realize that, because you're content with just going with the flow. Conformists."
5,KEVEN BETTER READ THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"First off the CD is awsome Still Waiting is so darn cool and the other songs are too. Stevo 32 is a good drummer, and I like him!Dave Brownsound is one of the best guitar players in the world! And he is not a retard! Biz is a great singer! He sings better than you ever could even in your wildest dreams! And last but not least NOBODY talks about my boy Cone! He is a good bass player, and he is one of the coolest guys around! And he is not fat! And how do you know what he smells like?! You have never been around him! You are a monkey fart, and a lot of people agree with me!!!!! Viewers buy this CD!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"If I could give 0 stars, I would","Words cannot express the regret I feel for ever handing money over to the cashier for this CD. Albums like these really (yes, r-e-a-l-l-y, not 'rele', Mr First Reviewer) need to have warnings: ""If you appreciate quality music, touch this drivel at your own risk - you might just lose your sense of taste"". I got about halfway through the first song, before changing tracks. Another 10 secs of Track 2 and the CD was out of the tray, shining brilliantly as it spun across the room. I do believe it's still under the sofa, gathering dust. Come on boys, learn some new chords, stop yelling, and would it kill you to spend more than 5 minutes on your cover design?"
1,not good at all!,hell song is the best song on the cd. every thing else stinks. track 3 stinks the most. it is a joke.
1,... for skate-boarding kids only.,"Really poor junk for kids with skate boards, baggy trousers and no sense of quality. Terrible ... and SO dull! DO NOT BOTHER."
4,Sum 41 Makes You Want to Get Infected,"Sum 41's junior release of Does This Look Infected sends a ear full into today's youth of pop/punk driven riffs that are pleasing and chock full of So Cal inspirings. This energized album contains riffs that incorporates the sound of Blink and Green Day directly into your stereo. The new single ""Still Waiting"" drives the same edge that Sum 41 always lives up to, and this Canadian foursome continue to live up to their standards. This is the new edge of punk, and I think you're going to like it."
5,sum 41 kicks @$$ on the new record,"I first bought their DVD and Loved it and realized how good they are live, so i decided to go out and buy their new album. It's one of the best buys this year!The music is awesome, I love everything from the Guitar riffs to the drumming to the lyrics.It's one of those things where you can't explain it you just have to listen to it yourself to know how much of an awesome record it is.The Bonus DVD that comes with it is great also, very entertaining.This album is on my top 5 list of this year"
1,Get my Skateboard. This stuff is AWESOME!,"Man I Love this stuff! It rocks! I'm really excited about this new CD! When I bought it the guy laughed and told me to buy some real hardcore punk! He said something about Black Flag! I thought they'd be like this so I downloaded some stuff of it off of WinMX. It scared me! So I put the Sum41 stuff back on! ""Still waiting for the world to stop hating"" is the line of the year."
3,"Eh,I Dunno",I really dunno what to say about this cd.I really liked Sum41 when they were more punky but now they have this weird hard rock thing going on.The cd was ok but I can see Sum41 sinking in there careers.Im really going to miss them!
1,"In all my life, I have never experienced such a disastrous album like this!","And bassically, I think this is the worst band EVER... They're not even musicians, just a pair of vandals who decided to make a band and accidentalley got some attention from retarded teenagers with no taste for music.I can't actually call what they do Music, the closest thing I can relate to their sound is ""a peacock with a broken neck""."
3,A couple good songs,"I couldnt wait to get this cd, i was so exited. then i got it for christmas, and i was totally shocked. the cd was such a disapointment! yeah, still waiting rocks, but that was the only song i liked on it. hell songs was OK. it was too metal, the last cd was perfect. i loved the last cd. i havent seen the dvd yet, but i hope its better than the cd."
5,Best Sum CD Yet!!!!!!!,"Does This Look Infected? is a one of a kind album! Sum has topped themselves yet again. With their angry, meaningful and fun lyrics, and riffs that stick in your head for months to come, this CD is one for the records! Their music has lost any trace of mainstream tunes in it, and is pure 100% punk, and much heavier and thought-provoking than any other bands music out right now!"
5,The Best,"I own all 3 of Sum 41's Cd's and also an unauthorized bio about then and ""Does This Look Infected"" blows them all out of the water. I own two copies, one for my cd player at home and one for my car."
5,sum 41.............,"this album is a change for the good. It's heaver than the previous album all killer no filler, so those who like the more pop/punk songs from all killer might not like this Cd. Some songs in here express a lot of emotion, like A.N.I.C. which I listen to when I'm very frustrated, (lol) The hell song and still waiting are great songs too. Over all this is a great album.-----The dvd is hilarious. I exspecially like the pain for pleasure video featuring Pain, Pleasure, Gunner, and Sniper. (you'll see)"
4,"""Sum"" really good songs.","I'm not their biggest fan, but I can't deny this is a really good disc, and it shows musical and lyrical growth over their last album. It's the catchy pop-punk you'd expect from them, but with a slightly harder edge. I think they've now taken the torch from ""Green Day"". Though the album is short, it's got some great tracks. Included is ""Hell Song"", ""Still Waiting"", and ""My Direction"", plus others that are nearly as rockin'. Also, the DVD it comes with is loaded with tons of stuff, and is a must for bigger fans. I only wish the packaging didn't remind me of Halloween everytime I see it. Overall, this is the disc with no filler."
5,does this look infected,"does this look infected-the brand new AMAZING cd for all you sum 41 people out there. from teen's to adult's, everyone will love this cd. this cd consists of the best sum 41 songs out there, plus you get a free bonus dvd (not available in shops). this is truly an amazing cd which will leave only good thought's in your mind about sum 41. from melow catchy tunes, to crisp and crunchy solos, and beleive me, this band knows how to make a good impression and they have done just that with their new cd. money well spent."
5,"Lives up to the hype and then ""Sum""","I didn't really think Sum 41 could live up to the hype they have attained since the first album. With this one though, they not only lived up to the hype but surpassed my expectations. This album rocks hard!It's fast, the entire CD flows, no bad or dissapointing tracks at all. You have to get this CD if you are a Sum 41 fan and if you haven't given Sum 41 a try, this is the perfect time to check them out. Best CD I've heard in a long time."
5,back from hell - hard and heavy,"sum41 comes back strong with this perfect follow-up for their break-through album 'all killer no filler'.the album starts with 'hell song', 'over my head' and 'my direction', 3 catchy songs and perfect pieces to see the changes of sum41's heavier style.next is the first single from this album - 'still waiting'.after that it carries on strong with songs like 'yesterday.com' or 'hyper-insomnia' to round out the great albulm you can listen to from the beginning to the end.only minus: its just 31 minutes of new sum41-music!"
3,3 stars ?,WELL sum 41 made a ok CD but it just isn't as good as CHUCK I love CHUCK because of that great song no reason but this CD does this look infected I'll say infected by a couple of songs not all of them this CD is a cD in the stores I wanted to buy but it's not right
2,Punk Versions of P.O.D.'s Sattelite CD,Sum 41 Track 6: No brains = P.O.D. Track 2: AliveSum 41 Track 12: Hooch = P.O.D. Track 3: BoomThey're not exactly the same but way way way too close to call their own.
5,Great,This is a great CD it has real good songs and a great quality of style and a little funny. I recomend it.
1,This Bites,"Yes this looks infected at a cost of 22 dollars you can listen to repetative overused riffs this band glorifies blink 182. I hope the wound ends this bands pitiful life in the mainstream,so that one day I can turn on the radio without having a burning sensation in my ears."
4,Good cd but a bit too short,"Well, to start off I hated All Killer..I thought it was one of the worst cds I'd ever heard and so I didn't have high expectations for this one. But then one day I was on Kazaa and found their single Still Waiting and figured i might as well give it a try..I loved it..so i waited till it came out and sampled some others and to my surprise they were all great..I like my punk more political usually and this cd's lyrics were really a step up from AKNF. They're less dumb and more concious. I still don't see a need for the parental advisory because other cds without stickers get by with more swearing then this cd has."
2,Only Two Good Songs and another OK one,The Only Good Songs on this Cd Worth listening to are Over My Head Better Off Dead and Still Waiting. Yesterday is the OK. I would suggest downloading these songs and not any others. The others are weak and just noise.
2,trying to hard,"when i listened to this cd, i had to lower my standards because sum 41 has always been horrible. i tried my hardest to like this album, but nothing short of the end of the world could make me like it. it seems like they were trying too hard to be different from their last two albums rather than make a good album. i gave this cd 2 stars only because its (sadly) their best album ever, and that isnt saying much"
1,"If You Think This Is Metal, Drown Yourself In A Toilet","How can Amazon.com say this draws inspiration from Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, or Motley Crue? If You Think This Is Metal, Drown Yourself In A Toilet. I listened to 4 song samples, and every single one of them was juvenille 4 chord up down pop-punk crap that a 3 month guitarist could play. Metal.... Puh...Leaz..... 0 stars"
5,Does This Look Infected? CD review,"This is a great CD, by a great punk/rock band. Sum 41 sounds like a completely different band on this CD. The songs really relate to what teens go through, from insecurity, to being bored, to just being plain mad at the world. This CD is a great addition to any CD library. It has a much harder sound compared to Sum 41s last two albums, All Killer No Filler(2001) and Half Hour of Power(2000). Its a great graduation to the next level of excellent lyrics and ear pounding drum beats and guitar riffs. BUY IT NOW!"
5,back to old school,"I absolutely love the new album! It's much closer to their original work in Half Hour of Power, which means not so much pop punk anymore. However, the style is much more mature and the messages in the lyrics are amazing. I was extremely impressed with the issues they touch on."
5,this is a freaking awesome ablum,Well to start off with sum 41 is a great band and they made does this look infected a great abulm. I think the cd was totaly worth buying because all the songs are different and has differnt meanings that come along. They are not just singing about what is going on with their life but others also. people that appericate this type of music would not regert buying this cd becuse they can relate to a lot of. I think everyone in the world shold have this cd if it was up to me but then agian some people can not see talent i fit smacks them in the face and im not god. The title of this cd says it all because it is infected it infects like no other way buy sending a message and giving you something to relate to so please do not waste time and buy this kick [butt] cd cause its awesome
5,Who wouldn't like SUM41?,"Hey,I just really wanted to get the word out about SUM41's new CD...Which came out Nov.26 2002. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPOINTED IF YOU BUY THE CD!!!! This CD is really great! It features their hit song ""Still Waiting"", (my favorite song on cd) This cd has so many great songs...If there are any SUM41 fans out there who have enjoyed there music in the past...you will love this cd...I promise you!!! These 4 guys are the coolest people...PLUS!!! The cd comes with a dvd which is the funniest thing you will ever see it is just really funny... Steve, Deryk, Cone, and Dave...are just very wild people you will love the cd very much. Well got to go!~*Robyn*~"
5,The Greatest album EVER!!!!!!!,"Sum 41 has given us many hits over the last 2 years or so but this is it this is the biggest, best album of all time with the songs ""Over My Head ( Better Off Dead)"" And "" The Hell song"" this album kills all other bands with there new single ""still waiting"" This is sure to be one of the greatest things we have heard from SUM 41"
5,If the cd is infected....so are my ears!!!,"This cd is so flipping awesome!!! I got it the day it came out, put it in my cd player and it hasn't seen the light of day since!!! I definetly recommend to ANYONE WITH ANY TASTE IN MUSIC to buy this cd!!!"
5,Sum 41- Does this look infected? BEST CD EVER,"I just want to say this is like the best CD ever. The music gets you going. If you've got a HUGE assignment to complete, listen to this CD. It will give you the energy to keep going. Even if you don't need the energy, it's still the best CD of all time. BUY THIS CD!!!"
3,Someone's had a little too much Offspring,"This album is quite cool, but I think All Killer No Filler is more original and I prefer the singing in it. On this album the singing is too much like Offspring. You know, that sort of shouting voice all the time. Otherwise, it's a good album, with some nice influences from old metal bands. They're getting there."
3,"ehhh,,,,,","i really liked all killer no filler. and i know that AKNF was EXTREMLY poppy but i swear this cd is 1 song repeated over again. its like, all of the songs could go into the chorus to ""still waiting"". however, with that said. i do think that their lyrics are pretty good and i respect that they didnt throw away their lyrical views. however ANIC is a terrible song and its the only reason the CD is PA anyway and that [made me angry].... the reason i'm giving this 3 stars and not 2 is because of the lyrics and i got to admit this is one FUN album. i could put this in and just go insane with it and i can imagine how awesome it is to see live. so, in my opinion, all killer no filler was just a little bit more original but this is just as much fun as their last album."
5,A word to kevin,So To Kevin its kinda obvious that u havent actually listend to this cd cuz when u listen to it u can tell that their is a HUGE difference between this record and their previous ones. their music is a lot heavier and it doesnt even sound remotely pop. also when it comes to blink 182 they r not a bunch of ppl who make records that sound the same cuz on their new self titled record they dont make stupid catchy dating stories and stuff about losing a girl. their videos dont have them running aroung naked and they put alot of thought into it. they did something new with their new record. and as for GC...their cool. on their upcoming CD (chronicles of life and death) i hear they r having some hip hop collabs and thats original...i dont no why u even bother to say that these bands r the same when they clearly arent. so to you all i have to say is BUy THE F*CKING RECORD.
5,"Good AJAX,ONTARIO BOYS!!","These guys rock, and their from a suburb east of Toronto, and have managed to make it as big time stars all over the world!!! Good for them!!!! And to Kevin and the other snotty americans who comment on these guys, nobody said they were punk rock, nobody is comparing them to the dead kennedies or whoever. Their just a fun rock band from canada....get a life!"
2,2 1/2 stars - too close to major influences,"an -oki- CD too much of it is ripped off however, and regurgated into this album repeatedly. it is very unoriginal, they dont stray very much from their influences at all. throughout this CD you can hear riffs taken from the likes of Metallica, Iron Maiden, a bit NOFX sounding too, and even Def Leppard.So if you were to compliment the guitar work, well alot of the riffs weren't even theirs, let alone their guitar skill is below par.However including a DVD was a nice thing for them to do, so that bumps my score up a bit, but alot of the stuff on the DVD was a bit poor, but it being included for free was something nice and only can add to my score.Not -too- bad of a CD, but totally unoriginal. and many blatant rip-offs of riffs. We all know sum 41 really like Iron Maiden, Metallica and such, but ripping riffs straight from them isn't doing them justice."
4,Canadian Punk Rockers Sum*41 Finally Make A Great Album,"Sum*41's new cd, Does This Look Infected,is an all around good album. There is not one bad song on this cd. Sum*41 has gotten alot better music wise (better guitar and drum solos)than their previous work, All Killer No Filler. They have also gotten alot harder and faster.This album takes a ... on All Killer No Filler,no doubt about it. Songs like The Hell Song,No Brains,and Over My Head Sound Alot Better than before.This cd is as good,if not better than Half Hour of Power. What Can I Say ? This album frickin rocks!"
4,Almost as Good,"i have listened to the new sum 41 cd (does this look infected?) and even though they're my favorite band, i have to say that i liked them as a more punk kind of bad. i don't think they should go hard rock. Don't get me wrong, and i don't meen to me negitive in this review, but i think that hard rock suits them. I like some of the songs on it (i.e. my direction, hooch, and hyper-insominia-para-condriod)But then there were songs that i didn't like as much, i like them but just not as much. but also if you like sum 41 then you should definetley go out and buy the cd."
5,what do i think about it?,"i am not a kiss-[butt]fan of sum 41 cuz thier ""hot"". ok, they do look good, i do addmit but i am rating this CD for what it is- musically. it is an inspiration that i just had to get the second it came out. The album rocked my world; and im pretty sure youll enjoy it too :) hope this helps you people out there...P.S. THE ALBUM ROXXXXXXX"
5,Dude,"Dude, this cd kicks butt. first off, all the songs are insanely ausome, secondly the guys of sum 41 are the coolest canadians alive."
4,Great CD,"Personally, I believe this cd is great. Unlike some groups going off on one subject such as girls and talking about their problems Sum 41 goes into other areas. I also enjoyed the way they delivered their messages."
5,LUV THIS CD,"its soooooooo good! i dont hav the DVD version, but it ROX!! every1 thinks is like pop-rock but its NOT its like that, i think its more of punk. I tried to play still waiting on the guitar but its really fast.............. this cd is worth EVERY PENNY!"
3,Much better then that Blink-182 ...,"I don't exactly like Sum-41 that much, but they are still easier to listen to then other bands like Blink-182 and New Found Glory. They are still a bit poppy, but not nearly as much as something like Good Charlotte, and they are also a bit heavier (if you can somehow call it that). If you enjoy this type of music, go ahead and grab the cd, and while your at it, pick up a copy of Rancid :)"
1,I've heard a lot better,"This album is horrible. All the songs sound the same. If you like the first song I guess you will probably like the rest. My suggestion is if you are into this sound try bands like ""Taking back Sunday"", ""The Beautiful Mistake"". Sum41 just doesn't have the lyrical impact that these bands do and as a guy who likes lyrics more then some guys crunching on a guitar i really can't give this album anything more then one star."
2,Slightly Disappointing,"Let me start off by saying I am a Sum 41 fan, so don't think I'm trying to bash them or anything. But I honestly think their was their weakest CD. It doesn't have the same flow of their last two albums. Unlike All Killer No Filler, not every song holds your attention until the end. The musicianship is better, but whats the use if the songs themselves aren't as infectious? There are some great songs though, I really only listen to the first 5 then I turn it off. I dont know what kind of vibe they were going for here but its definetly not working. Its almost like their trying to un-sell out or something, their trading in their pop, TRL-cred and trying to gain metal cred or something. Thats great, but I'm not for it if it drags down the quality of the songs..."
5,I'm truly infected,"This album from the sums is simply amazing. The only two songs I must admit I prefer least is 'all messed up' and 'my direction'. The rest of the album in my opinion is pure cream. I hope they will continue this way in terms of being themselves and doing agressive music like that, I love it!!! If u like hard guitars riff and heavy sounds, buy this album."
5,I would give it more stars if I could!,"Sum 41 is by far one of my favorite bands, and this is by far one of my favorite albums. I recommend this highly to people who love and listen to Blink-182."
5,Awesome,"I have to say that this cd is awesome. There isnt one song that i dont like, and the bonus DVD is funny. Ive always liked Pain For Pleasure, and the DVD is all about them. The free EP is also pretty damn cool. The songs on this cd seem to be more mature, in a good way, except of course for the song A**hole, its a classic."
2,ZZZZZum 41....,"the all killer record kicked ass. this is just too much metal, now don't get me wrong - I love metal, but this is just one big parody on metal in my ears. opening with a song that is so close to nickelbacks - this is how you remind me (or whatever it's called) I'm surprised that they're even getting away with it..."
1,THIS ISN'T MUSIC,This album is REALLY bad. Talentless goof-offs try to show off their horrible songwriting skills to the public.Still Waiting sounds the exact same as Have You Ever from the Offspring's Americana CD (only the offspring are a good band.)I wouldn't get this album unless someone payed you to.
2,What happened to them?,"Sum 41 used to be my favorite band, but they've changed. I liked it best when they were just starting out. When I heard this cd I couldn't believe my ears. Their music is all messed up. If only they could go back to their old music. They make me sad."
1,Just Plain Boring,"Even though I don't own any other Sum 41 cds, I have heard lots of their older songs and have enjoyed some of them. Back when this came out, I decided to get it only to grow sick of this cd almost instantly. There are very few songs that I liked at all on here and while The Hell Song and Still Waiting were listenable for a little while, they soon grew old. I heard that they tried to be more innovative with their upcoming cd so we will see but I remain skeptical. Anyways I would not recommend this cd to people because there are just so many better punk/rock cds out there and this isn't one of them."
5,Great CD,"The new sum 41 cd, does this look infected was the best cd I had ever listened to. Right after school, the day it came out I rushed to the local music store and bought it, I locked myself in my room all day and just listened to this CD nonstop! A perfect follow-up for all killer no filler, definitely buy this CD!"
5,Toms Review on Sum 41's Does this look infected?,"This album is amazing, ive listened to it many times over. i thought all killer no filler what the best ever and couldnt be topped. I was obviously wrong. and another great part of actually buying the cd is, it comes with a bonus DVD, so for most of you CD pirates who dont buy cds, this one, you should because its an awesome CD and awesome bonus DVD. Sum 41 is just crazy people, and that is what makes them excellent and great above all other bands. *to those who know this line, please laugh* ""get the pizza!"""
5,Great CD. Better DVD!,"this is a great buy. especially if you can find it for cheap. fns of half hour of power or all killer no filler should find the same energy and emotion as the prior cd's but it still feels unique. what makes this an even better deal is the included DVD with all kinds of cool stuff, like home movies and the documentary of Pain For Pleasure. overall its really good. i reccomend to pretty much anyone less you mind the language."
5,sum 41,"Sum 41s new cd is their best work yet. They cover everything from world problems(so am i still waiting, for this world to stop hating) to a**holes(A.N.I.C.) in the short 31 minutes they use. They have a new style that is similar enough to keep their old fans and to bring in new ones. They still have there punk sound but they have added a metal touch to it in just the right way so it sounds great. They're whole CD 'does this look infected' has pictures of them where they all look demented and very cool. They once again show that they are just teens trying to have fun and do what they love. If you haven't purchased this album yet, it would definatlly be a good choice. Oh, and i love the CD"
3,"Good,not great","You have to admit that Sum 41 is a pretty good band.This album is probably better than the last (though I have not heard all of their last album). I would recommend it because it does have some really good songs. The best track is ""Still Waiting"",so if you like it buy it!It's good!!!!"
1,This pre-packaged redneck should be destroyed,"Blue Racer: Say bug, isn't Kelly Clarkson only famous for being a pretty face. Japanese Beetle: You are correct Serpent Son, this hillbilly harlot can't sing and looks like one of those cheap h**kers in Full Metal Jacket(Me so h*rny, me love you long time)! Blue Racer: (laughing) Bug, that is so true! I can sing better than her and wasn't made famous due to American Midol! Japanese Beetle: Should be avoided or HAASAH(karate chop) SAYONARA!"
5,Great horror flick..teens love this thriller!,This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat. The music and screen effects are definitely a plus. A must see on the weekend with family and friends.
1,I got your Kolobos right here!,"What in the hell was I thinking when I bought this turd for $1.00 + shipping ?The reviews were pretty poor but I was suckered into buying it by some one saying it was overly gory, not even close gore hounds.We have some good actors with a lame plot, I like the gore and would have upped the score for some T & A but there is none.Lets just make up the story as we go like some ol phony Italian splatter flick.Stay away from this one gang."
4,The only review worth reading!,"I thought Kolobos to be a highly entertaining and terrifying film. What do the first to guys above expect from a film with such a low budget? Take a look at recent ""horror"" pics with BIG budgets such as ""Scream"", ""Urban Legend"" or ""I know what you did last Summer"", these films are merely laughable whereas Kolobos delivered sheer horror and was actually quite disturbing. Watch it.......but not alone!"
1,Oh My Gawd!,"I can't begin to tell you how bad this movie really is. I'm actually glad I bought it. I throw it in when I'm having parties - just for laughs. I don't think any time was spent on story, structure, continuity, dialogue, set design, and FX. It was probably written in less than a month. Low budget or not, the story and lines were so weak, it makes absolutely everything laughable. There are more holes in this plot than all the cheese in Wisconsin. In fact, there's more cheese in this plot than... you get the idea. Buy it for a good laugh. Perhaps this might become a cult classic just due to its absurdity."
1,awful,"I agree with the reviewer who advised not to rent or buy this movie. I bought a used copy because I liked the art design on the box. The acting is okay -- esp. for a low budget film, but the script [is bad]. The movie seems to be a rip-off of countless other films. And the victims being trapped in the house with a killer is so cliche! There isn't even any T & A to make it half-way appealing!Don't rent or buy this -- you've been warned!!!"
5,As good as it gets,"For me, this is about as good as independent horror gets. Smart script, tight action, and a top-notch cast. Some viewers come down on the ending, but for me that's what made this film so perfect. Viewers may find themselves lost at times, but they'll just have to use their heads a bit. This is a thinking person's horror film where time and place are two concepts that rarely go hand in hand."
3,Kolobos; 'To mutilate',A Suspiria copy in everything from music to lighting effectsbut quite good of its kind. Plus Linnea Quigley's in it and she getsshoved on moose antlers for the first time since her almost identical demise in Silent Night Deadly Night. Top stuff.
5,From a cat-lover,This book is just what I needed! It has fairly simple stepswhich create great results in only a few minutes. I borrowed thisbook from a friend and I was drawing grrreat tigers before I had to give it back. Now all I have to do is buy it! :)
1,Be careful what you order,I was looking for a crystal stopper for a number of crystal decanters. Thought this book might offer me some information about stoppers and manufacturers of crystal stoppers. Boy was I surprised to receive this novel in the mail
5,"Bright, thought-provoking, and sexy","I've enjoyed Simon Sheppard's well-written erotica in the past, but with Kinkorama he's proven that he can not only describe hot and kinky man-to-man sex, he can ponder and contemplate its deeper meanings. This book, in other words, appeals to the reader's mind, heart, and groin all at once. A fine combination of readable style, personal reflection, tasty erotic detail, and wide-ranging description of the BDSM world, Kinkorama will give outsiders a vivid view of that world and help those of us who are part of it understand a good bit better why we love what we love, why we find beauty and intensity where we do."
5,The soothing sounds of J.G.,"This is the best that r&b can get! Johnny's ""My,My,My"", produced by Babyface, is one of my favourite songs of all time!! All i can say is buy this album! You won't regret it!"
5,I like this saler,I like this saler my item came in bforethe time they list and it was in good ship just like the list stated
3,Be aware of expired ink,"As of this writing, the Matte Black and Yellow cartridges sold on Amazon are fulfilled by Wild Dog Knives. These two cartridges were 3-4 years past their expiration date. My B9180 printer will let me override the expiration warning, but HP says expired ink can damage the printheads. Although there is a place on Amazon's Web site that shows that the cartridges sold by WDK are expired, the main page for this product does not. So, I ordered the two cartridges without ever seeing ahead of time that they were expired. I have been pleased with my HP printer and the inks as far as picture quality goes, however I give this product a 3-star rating because it seems that the ink empties too quickly on the HP 38 cartridges. I've spent a lot of money on ink and seem to have too few photos to show for it. However, I don't know if Epson or Canon are any better at ink usage and cost."
1,Very Upset about this EXPIRED printer cartridge,"I got an error putting this cartridge in my printer, the expiration date is 2010, I have printed three pictures - not very much black - and the cartridges are now telling me they are empty. They were not full when I first put them in which must be why I got an error. I cannot believe the price I paid for an expired product that is worthless! Never again!"
1,"forgive hp, they know not what they do","perhaps you are considering such an outrageous price tag to compensate for epson's total lack of reliability, as that is what drove me to buy hp. i have a b8850 and it goes thru these ink cartridges like a baby goes thru bottles! no really, you can bank on buying 2 of each color a year if you print more than 10 pages a year. thats because hp imprints an expiration date on the cartridges to prevent you from stocking up when they go on sale. once the expiration date nears the printer will not print until the cartridge is replaced. i bought this less then a year ago and it is expired. even though it is half full i need to replace it. this printer costs me about 500$ a year and i dont use it much. other than cost and extreme sluggishness, its a fine printer and of all the 40~ cartridges ive gone thru in 3 years not one was ever defective."
3,It's ink,"It's the manufacturers ink cartridge. It works, but it is grossly overpriced. But they all are and so you are stuck. What can you say. The printer does make very nice prints tho."
3,It's ink,"It's the manufacturer's ink cartridge. It works, but it is grossly overpriced. But they all are and so you are stuck. What can you say. The printer does make very nice prints tho."
5,Perfect for your studio with the HP Photosmart Pro B9180,"This is more a review of AMAZON's great service than the ink. If you own the HP B9180 then you simply Must use this ink.My local photo stores and office supply stores simply do not stock this ink... and ordering from other online shops id ""iffy"" at best.

5,wonderful,Love the crisp clear singing of Judy Collins. Her rendition of Amazing grace is second to none. ...and all the other songs harken back to a simpler calming melody with a message of care and concern for the world around us. Wonderful.
4,Solid astronomical textbook,This book may not be the most flashy in illustrations and will require that you actually read whole sections instead of just browsing the highlights in sidebars. But it does contain a lot of solid information going into more detail on several topics than other introductory textbooks. It is targeted rather at the graduating physics student than at an interested lay person.
4,"The New Cosmos, Intro Astronomy & Astrophysics","This book meets my expectations in that it covers a wide variety of topics, in some detail. I wanted to take a ""step up"" regarding technical detail, and this book is what I was looking for. The only drawback is the occasional heavy mathematics, but this is something I can grow into, and is not essential to enjoying the book."
2,German Science,"Being a German-American, I thought this book would get to the rudiments of astrophysics - and it does. Unfortunately, I seem to fall asleep before reading a page or two. The book is full of information ... in TEXT form. The illustrations offered are dry and somewhat difficult to extract information from. The methods of problem solving assume that you have a good handle on the topics discussed already (not for introductory Astrophysicists). If you are in need of a book to give straight to the point explanations, and fundamental equations - you've found it! Try reading at a coffee shop, though - and no decaf!"
1,Different item,"I ordered ""Forever"" by Dune (1997) and I received an entirely different album: ""Forever and Ever"" (1998). Both were recorded with the London Session Orchestra."
5,Good basic information for biologists interested in the Neuroscience of Emotions,"The information in Affective Neuroscience covers all information from a evolutionary perspective including literature from birds and mammals. In every case human responses, regions of the brain, etc. are the same or very similar. One of the most interesting inclusions is the information about mental disorders associated with improper functions of the receptors described. The synthesis of material is very good, although the author is not a succint writer. Themost thought-provoking section of each chapter is the last section, Afterthought of the author.I recommend this book as a resource, but recent PET Scan information would improve the relevance of this book Perhaps the author can add an addendum to each chapter or better yet, write a new version of this very valuable book."
1,"Bland, boring & banal",This album bored me to tears. The music lacks any interest. Most of the songs plod along at the same tempo. Half the songs on the album drag out longer than five minutes when a minute would do. There is nothing original here. It sounds like most of the stuff cluttering AAA radio these days.
1,Thought baby would love it--did not.,"I thought my baby girl, Tyler, would just love this. I was wrong.She did love Baby Mozart, but she was a baby and basically it helped me get her to sleep. This one is just too slow, and doesn't teach much. Maybe its good for the infant stage, but doesn't work with toddlers. I was disappointed with it, and wish that they would change their format even more. It's too similar to all the others, and who needs 10 of the same thing."
3,8 month old not captivated . . .yet!,"My 8 month old son loves Baby Mozart and Baby Neptune and so does my 16 month old grandson (my son's nephew :>), but neither were captivated by this one. There seems to be too much stopping to announce what sequence is coming next - it loses them everytime. If they kept the music going it would help, that seems to be a big part of the babies' enjoyment and when they cut it off to say, ""What animals are in the Savannah"" and then open a little door to a still life picture of each animal the babies' attention is lost. A note of interest this DVD seems to be the same or really close to the newest Baby Einstein:Baby Noah.Now that he is a year old he is much more interested! Just needed to wait."
1,...,"This video was lent to us by a friend of my wife's. Thank god we didn't waste our money on it. This video has way too much very [poor] puppetry, interspersed with a very little stock nature footage (probably cost them nothing) and a couple of scenes of kids in costumes ([inepensive]labour?). Our 18 month old daughter enjoyed (or, anyways, watched) the video once, but now only wants to see the actual nature footage. I don't blame her as the other parts are horrible. If you want some nature footage though, this video is not the way to go. Get something from PBS or the BBC, something that actually has educational value, not this piece of***."
2,VHS used tape,"Average quality. When a vendor sells a used item and they say as good as new , you expect that, They should have said used as good as used could be."
3,Nice Images,"My husband and I like to watch this video as well as our 22-month old son. The images of the animals are nice, but unless we constantly repeat to our son what the animals are, he won't remember. I also think the segments are too short. And the trumpeting giraffe...he looks stoned and scares us all. The music is good, and we all like the ""animals in the ocean"" segment."
4,Dolittle review,"My son at age of 5, still loves to watch this movie and play along with his toy animals"
5,Learning and Fun,My 2 year old loves this video. We also have the neighborhood animals. He has learned all of the animals and their sounds! It has been very educational and entertaining. Our 7 month old will watch it also but he is more interested in the language nursery video (which is great too)!!! My 2 year old loves these videos and wants to watch them over and over again. I highly recomend them for parents looking to teach animals to their child. More appropriate for toddlers than babies. Go Einstein!!
1,really can't recommend this one,"normally i love the baby einstein videos--we have all of them. this one is particularly bad. it is not as good as any of the other ones and it is a real step backwards from the baby dolittle neghborhood animals. it is too slick for one (meaning it doesn't have some of the cuteness of the previous videos), the monkey isn't particularly enticing or interesting enough to hold my son's attention, the dolphin song is really bad and annoying, the computer animated drawings introducing the animals are pointless, and it has clearly lost some of the magic that made the other videos so popular."
1,"Less than happy, here's better ones","This video just doesn'nt seem to cut it. The images are nice,but the puppetry is a bit scary and uninviting. It just seems like a waste of energy to watch.I really like Baby Animals, both in the Wild and on the Farm from DK products. Also try Baby KnowItAll for 2 and under.they are all better than this."
4,"A little confusing, but still a great volume.","Finally, I got volume 4-7 and number 9. Number 8 was on backorder from the website I ordered it from. I have to admit that this volume was a little confusing. Things went by a little fast, and new characters were introduced almost immediately which made things a little difficult to follow probably.But, I did enjoy it. Maho and Tsubasa hates Yukino. People are still ignoring Yukino and she seems to realize that they found her out, and she's willing to admit it. Can she deal with this?This was a great volume and I recommend you to continue the series to see what's going on."
5,Best Shakespeare bio ever!,"Of course, any biography of Shakespeare is mostly a biography of Renaissance England, since so little is known of his actual life, but Ackroyd pulls together every scrap of fact and weaves it all together in a way that makes the era and the man full of life and energy. He uses a lot of ""evidence"" from the plays, but that's okay. Did Shakespeare follow the dictum ""write what you know?"" I loved this biography; I feel like I know Shakespeare the man as well as I possibly can! (I listened to it on CD; very well done.)Bobbye Larson"
4,Well-read Shakespeare,"Usually the Bard can be very dry to read about.The author interweaves his life with the history of the period in England and its goings-on.If you really like Shakespeare you'll love this. I started to read it thinking I can always come back to it later. Well, I am still reading it.If there is any draw back it is the fine print, especially at 70 yrs of age."
2,"Well written, non-biography","Ackroyd's is surely a better read than Greenblatt's, but, as is typical of the genre, it only succeeds to the extent that it makes things up. Should be titled: Shakespeare, The Novel."
2,What about Bill?,"The book tells us little about Shakespeare himself. Rather, it is a chronicle of Elizabethan times in England. We learn more about his contemporaries, e.g. Johnson, than we do about Shakespeare. There is even more information in the book that touches on the physical layout of the Globe Theater than the playwrite. The book is, however, a fairly concise, yet informative listing of his plays."
5,Delightful and Informative,"Do you think little is known about Shakespeare? I was under that impression until I read Peter Ackroyd's brilliant study. I will go back to reading my Shakespeare with greater perception and enjoyment. As in ""Sir Thomas More"" the author takes you right into the streets of Shakespeare's London and gives you the sights and smells of Elizabethanplayhouses. A wonderful, delightful, informative book. Highly recommended."
5,Best reiki programs,"I started my reiki journey the tradional way with an in - person level 1 attunement. The master that attuned me said I'd have to wait a long time to do level 2 and master level.I felt like I was being controlled. I knew there had to be a better way. I bought all of Steve's books- Ultimate guides 1 through 4 and the DVD's for 2nd & Master attunements, plus the Reiki attunements performed & aura DVD. They were awesome and so simple to use. The 2nd level atunement was powerful. I could use the level 2 symbols immediately from his teaching. If you want a great program get all of Steve's books & DVD's !"
5,A great book to view all of America!,"This book is great for people of all ages. If you have ever wanted a book to show the diversity of America while showing how the states all work as a whole, then this book is for you. There are beautiful pictures, histories, overviews of different cities and maps to locate where things are. I highly recommend this book to anyone with a love of this country!"
1,Avoid this book,"Fans of any type of literature will find this book to be a grave disappointment. There lacks any main theme, aside from the man himself. It contains several articles regarding different aspects of his life and inventions, jumps haphazardly from one subject to the next, but its greatest failing is it's quality. It has the appearance of biography thrown together by an uninterested sixth-grader. There are many pictures, many of them poor quality photocopies, and there is even an article copied from an encyclopedia. It is rare to see sometihng of this poor quality, and it is always shameful."
4,Almost perfect,"About Stravinsky's music--what is there to say? This is a good orchestra with good sound in St. Petersburg's magnificent Mariinsky Theatre. The dancing is great and it's fascinating to see a recreation of Nijinsky's original choreography of Sacre du Printemps from 1913, with Roerich's backdrops. My only complaint is the cinematography. During the orchestral sections, too many shots of the conductor and too few of the musicians. In the ballets, too many close-ups of the dancers and too few of the whole stage--as if you were watching most of the performance through binoculars. Then there are overhead shots of the dancers that make little sense. That said, this is a wonderful performance, and if you aren't lucky enough to see it live, I highly recommend the DVD."
4,Good for beginners,"It's a good first book about poker, to learn the basics, but if you want to be good, nothing beats practice practice practice. When you start getting the hang of it, you can complement this book with something a little more in-depth in the particular game you're into. Summary - buy this as a first book, don't expect it to give you all the answers."
2,Very difficult to read and a serious lack of content,"The author's writing style is very difficult to follow. This book takes you in circles telling you one thing and then another. The charts printed in the book are pretty much useless. There is a lot of filler in this book to make it seem worthy, but it's not. I recommend avoiding this book."
2,Has some value. Could be better.,"I found Gary Carson's book to be a tough read. Gary is certainly someone who know the ins and outs of poker, but the book just doesn't flow. After about half way through I was forcing myself to complete it. His basic points that you have to adjust your play to the table, and how to think about odds is valuable. It was just hard to get through it to find the nuggets of useful information."
5,Outstanding!!,"Well written and easy to understand narrative to understanding the easy to learn but hard to master game of Hold-em. Thanks to the author's explanations, I'm able to see the game alot more clearly. Recommend the book highly to any beginner or as a good brush up to any Thursday night gamer."
3,Complicated,I am sixty pages into this book. I play a regular friday night game with about ten weeks experience. My complaint thus far is that he make ALOT of assumptions about the readers familiarity with terms. I read some paragraphs OVER and OVER and I am still bewildered.
1,Waste of Money,"This movie is a huge disappointment. The animation is sad. The story is very lame. The kids enjoyed watching it, but never asked to watch it a second time. As for a film for the WHOLE family to enjoy, forget it! Adults will loathe this movie. The storyline also is way out there, almost drug-induced with flying sasquatch and humans. We wish we had not wasted our money on this."
2,Horrible,"I have only owned this wrist support less than 6 months and it is falling apart already, I would not recommend buying it, now I have to buy another one, hopefully another brand."
4,Great for MS Flight Simulator,The bundle software is good. The pedals works great to control your rudder in MS Flight Simulator 2004.
1,Disappointed,"My daughter was bored by this one. It just didn't seem to flow like some of the other Baby Einstein videos. Also, the music didn't seems especially Christmas-y or festive. I would not recommend this one. Buy Baby Mozart, the First Moves or First Signs videos instead."
3,This is the only Baby Einstein video that bored my son.,"My youngest was 16 months old this past Christmas. We were at my in-laws house, along with my 19 month old nephew. My mother in law turned this video on for them. They both watched all of 3 minutes of it before walking away. This coming from 2 boys who can watch every other video in the series a million times in a row and not lose interest."
2,Disappointing,"My Triplet 2 year olds have been watching videos from the Baby Einstein series since they were 6 months old. The quality of this one does not measure up to the rest. It seems almost like a 'home-movie'. The sound quality and music selecions are not as good and the visuals are slow. There is not much action, and for infants and young toddlers it is difficult to have much reference to what it is they are seeing (ie. that the puppets are reindeer, etc). I think the video should be more self-explanatory in some way so that the 'Christmas-uninitiated' will have more understanding of it. The boys will watch it but are not as captivated by this one as by the others. They seem to get more out of it now though than they did when they were 17 months (at Christmas)."
2,Lots of potential wasted,"What a waste! This could have been a great video, but it is not. What a perfect chance to identify objects of the season (like the animal ones that identify the animals), show the kids giving gifts to older people, the puppets preparing for santa, etc. This is what we were expecting but this BE does not deliver. The music is poor, the scenes are choppy and the kids are not doing anything interesting. The kids are in front of a blue or green screen like they were going to add a background but then decided not to. Very annoying! We own every BE in the series and this is the only one my daugthers will not sit through. Hopefully future BEs are not this bad!"
3,Baby Santa = Baby Bored,"I hate to sound so harsh, but I feel this video was a waiste of money. Previously, I purchased Baby Mozart & Bach. My daughter loved the music and the viduals. She danced in front of the television and viewed the entire video.Baby Santa's music and vusuals are not captivating enough. My daughter walked away from the television the first few minutes the video started to play. I tried to interact with her while watching the video, but nothing seemed to work.Try it you might have better luck (every child is different)! I do reccommend Baby Mozart as your first purchase! Have Fun!"
2,Baby Santa's music box,"Our 1 year old daughter has all the videos from the baby einstein company but this one is ""boring"". It is not up to mark with the other videos. The music or the visuals does not hold my daughter's attention. All we end up seeing are some puppets and kids faces. We were highly disappointed since we expected this to be of the same quality as the other videos!!"
2,Just not the same as the others,"Unfortunately, Baby Santa's Music Box does not appeal to my nine month old son. He loves Baby Mozart, Baby Einstein and Baby Bach, and has even taken to Baby Shakespeare despite its claim to be for toddlers. With Baby Santa, the formula has changed slightly. It contains more children shots, and less of the repetitive action shots that keep babies entranced. The video may be appealing to adults because the children bits are very cute and the music nostalgic (traditional tunes and parts of the Nutcracker!), but these concepts are lost on the infant because he does not have the context in which to place them. Although I applaud the concept and the attempt, I would have to say I cannot recommend this video, at least for childen under one year. Perhaps an older child might see more merit in it. Beyond this, I would still recommend any of the other Baby Einstein Company videos."
3,Baby Mozart still our favorite!,"I was very excited to see that there was a new ""Baby Einstein"" video out with a Christmas theme! After watching the video with my 7 month old and 4 year old daughters, I was disappointed. The video did not seem to keep their attention as much as Baby Mozart. I was expecting the video to be more ""vibrant""! I've purchased Baby Van Gogh for my daughters for Christmas but haven't viewed it yet.........so far Baby Mozart is still the favorite!"
3,Disappointing,"Triplet 2 year olds have been watching videos from the Baby Einstein series since they were 6 months old. The quality of this one does not measure up to the rest. It seems almost like a 'home-movie'. The sound quality and music selecions are not as good and the visuals are slow. There is not much action, and for infants and young toddlers it is difficult to have much reference to what it is they are seeing (ie. that the puppets are reindeer, etc). I think the video should be more self-explanatory in some way so that the 'Christmas-uninitiated' will have more understanding of it. The boys will watch it but are not as captivated by this one as by the others. They seem to get more out of it now though than they did when they were 17 months (at Christmas)."
1,I'm calling for a refund,"HORRIBLE!!! My 4 month old son cried (he's not a crier either) the whole time. It did not hold his interested, nor my 3 years old. We only have Baby Noah which has kept their interest, but this DVD is absolutely is the worse. DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS! If you are looking for a holiday themed video, buy Mickey's Christmas. The colors are great and the songs too. It keeps both my little one occupied while I make dinner. However, baby Santa music box does not help develop my baby, just makes him mad at me for watching this horrible thing. I would say anyone that was interested could have my copy for free, but then I wouldn't want to torture you!"
1,Waste of money - other Einstein movies MUCH better,"We're big fans of the Baby Einstein movies (we have Baby Neptune, Baby Noah, Baby Beethoven, Numbers Nursery, and Neighborhood Animals) and were very disappointed with Baby Santa. Our son has been watching Baby Einstein movies since he was 5 months old (he's now 11 months) and he was completely bored with Baby Santa. It spends entirely too much time showing spinning ornaments - there are so many enticing images that could have been displayed to capture the theme of Christmas. There's maybe two images of Santa (I was hoping the movie would help alleviate fears of Santa by showing him as a nice guy...), and there's a few great snow images... but the good images are few and it seems like it's just ornament after ornament. There's more to Christmas (from the eyes of a child) than ornaments! The songs were good, but we were a bit surprised they used a Dreidel song."
5,These are the original recordings!,All I need to say is that these are the original cuts (not re-recordings). You purists will know what I'm talking about! Buy with confidence.
5,Great Bike Cover,"This is my third Nelson-Rigg Deluxe cover, third bike, third cover. First cover stayed out doors in the sun, rain and such for a summer, color faded a little bit but it kept the bike dry. After about 3 years of use, cover is still in good shape, no rips or tears. Second cover pretty much stays inside. Third cover, same model as the first two, just a different color. I like each one, happy with all three."
4,"Good cover for the money, don't expect.....","I believe this cover is a pretty good buy, but don't expect it to be completely weather tight; it's not tarp material. My bike is undercover, in addition to this product being over it. I bought an XL to fit my 2003 V-Star 1100, it is snug. I do not have a windshield, but do have saddlebags on it, wish I would have bought a 2XL to have a little more slack, but this will work fine for now. This product also looks good when on, if that matters."
4,Nelson Rigg MC-902-04 XL cover,"First cover I've owned and it does what it says. The stuff bag it comes with is convenient. So far it's been rained and snowed on and the bike doesn't receive any of the moisture. It's a tight fit with a sissy bar and windshield but that's the way it supposed to work. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that the fabric is thinner than I thought it would be, and I wonder how long it will last, but time will tell."
4,Dame Felicity,"I first heard Dame Felicity when she sang CAPRICCIO. In Paris I heard her in recital, one of which she san THE ROSES OF PICARDY. It was so beautiful I wondered about how THE LAST ROSE OF SUMMER would be with her singing. I bought her recording of THE LAST ROSE in a version by Benjamin Britten. I don'e like and don't play this. But it's no fauly of this performer."
1,wrong measurements,"Measurements were not right so it wouldn't fit in spot i needed it to fit.Sent in corrections and gave away as gifts,very unhappy."
5,I loved this book,"In the book you feel sympathy toward the main charactor, David.david is an orphan looking for someplace where he will feel belonging. This book is about finding where you belong and being loved. David in the end finds that he does not want to be a lonerand he wishes to belong and to love those who love him."
4,Loner,"The Loner is a very eciting book. It has a great cast of charecters. My favorite was cluny who keeps you on your toes. the book keeps you thinking about what will happen next and has agreat lesson to it. The story takes place in the mountains of Montana, where a boy runs of and meets a sheepherder named Boss.There was also Jup and Juno who belonged to Boss."
1,dissapointed,"I expected an objective tale of a prewar life of Polish Jews in Poland. Jewish writer Tuszynska failed in my opinion. She is one of many Polish Jews who when discovered their roots try to make a living writing about Jewish subjects. Some are better than others, some worst. Tuszynska's great knowledge of Singer is unquestionable but her observations reflect deep anti-Polonizm. Maybe if she tries harder in a future she can create a masterpiece. One star for Tuszynska's book for picking the subject but I believe Singer deserves better."
4,Diva Deluxe !,This book was simply fantanstic! It was uplifting and refreshing. It reminds you that you are a strong black woman to be admired and adored. It focuses on the importance of taking care of yourself.
3,decent read,"i wasn't blown away reading this book, but it was a decent read. not everyone can afford some of the things she suggested to buy or do. she did alot of designer name dropping and she speaks some french in it, so i'm glad i remember some phrases from high school. there were some good pointers and i did learn a few things, but it's wasn't my cup of tea."
2,Sorry Copycat of BAP handbook,"This book was an awful copycat take on the BAP handbook. Eager to pick up where the BAP handbook left off, it fails miserably. This book brings on a fake air of sophistication by use of too many unusual adjectives and french phrases that no one understands.This book makes unreachable middle aged black female entertainers the center of admiration while ignoring the average career woman.Music, furs, and designer clothing are all it takes to be fabulous according to Beautylicious. The coverage of other topics are similiar to reading Essence. A sorry waste of time."
3,not so beautylicious...,"So, I bought this book thinking that it would have a lot more info than it actually had. I was disapointed. I had a friend who had the Modern Girls Guide...so I figured I would by the BEAUTYLICIOUS version...I think I'm gonna go ahead and purchase the Modern Girls Guide..."
3,Just for girls,"Beautylicious is cute and just as the title says it's really for Black ""girls"". Most grown women over the age of 25 won't get much out of it. The book does do one very fine thing right away. It dicusses black women and our physical and mental health. So many of us have been taught that emotional problems don't happen to black folks and this myth has ruined a lot of lives. Ms. Raines states very strongly that there is nothing wrong with seeking mental help and I commend her for that."
3,It was ok,"While reading the book I felt like a lot of the information was good to know, such as a good moral booster but other than that it was just average. It did have a good movie and book list recommendation."
4,A different side of punk,"This thing called punk is a funny thing. As we continue to dissect everything that has fallen out of this cultural revolution we find that it has reached areas we otherwise would have never considered.This is one of them. From the oppressed in Poland is a few licks that have a punch that we in the Western world aren't used to hearing. It's a testament to the music style really, as it sees no borders.Ksu and Dezerter are the stand out bands on this disc. I couldn't tell you 99 percent of the lyrics mean, but if these people can listen to our Western stuff and not complain about a langauge barrier well then I don't have a problem either."
1,Too much work for poor results,"Very difficult to achieve the mold, and then the plaster didn't fill in all areas, so i'm left with a partial, useless handprint. Complete waste of time and money."
1,Precious Hands,This product is absolutely worthless. I tried it on my six year old and four year old grandsons. Even though I followed the instructions explicitly the plaster was too runny the first time and a thick glob the second time. A total waste of time and money.
1,Terrible waste of money!,"We purchased this craft to use a gift from my 8 month old daughter to her grandmother - what a joke! After my baby was asleep we tried to ""imprint"" her foot (thinking that it would be easier than her hand) - the wait time for the gel to dry was well over 1 minute, and wouldn't you know - baby woke up and the whole thing was a huge mess. The entire craft is now in the trash and we have nothing to show for our hellacious attempts. DO NOT BUY unless your child is old enough to understand holding his or her hand still and can do this for more than a minute."
4,It's been over 10 years,"I used this on my 2 sons when they were preschool age (they're now 16 & 17 years old). We are a military family, so we move a lot, and through all the moves, these molds of my sons hands have endured and still look great today.I now also have 2 daughters, who are preschool age, and was happy to see this was still around. Last night we did my older daughter's hand, although it took two tries, now I need to go buy another to do my younger daughter.These things last, and are so awesome to have, as they capture even the tiniest crease and groove of the hand. I didn't give it 5 stars though because sometimes, even with an older child, it takes more than one try to get it right. I think they need to add a little more gel because if your child touches the bottom, you'll have to redo it.I always add slightly less water to the gel mixture than it calls for, otherwise it spreads too thin and takes longer to set."
1,Gel hardens quickly out of no where,We have two of these kits. Unfortunately we never made it past the gel part. First time my son squeezed his hands and the gel hardened. Second one our 2 week olds feet didn't go deep enough because the gel spread out too thinly on the plastic heart. Disappointing. Great idea but poor gel.If the company reads this post. Raise the price by a dollar or two and add a second or even a third gel packet. Maybe even develop a clay that we could mold our children's prints into.
1,what a joke,This product is very hard. I have twins that are 14 now and I did this with them but it took several kits. Now I have a two year old and I have had to buy 3 kits so far and no success. I will try a few mor times because I would like one for all three girls. It would be helpfull if they sold the gel separately.
2,You only have one shot at it,"This is pretty cool, if you get it right. however I bought this as a replacement for the first one of thses that My Little girl got and the gel set up before the clumps were out. this one didn't set up for several minutes and was to thin to make a real good mold. would like another pack of gel incase the first one doesn't work."
4,This rings true!,"With twenty years experience working inside a corporation, consulting to organizations, and working with their executives....I find this book one of the most practical works on creativity I've read. Stan uses real-world stories and gives workable solutions. His ideas excite without intimidating. I find myself thinking, ""This is doable!"" I can see this book bringing hope to overwhelmed executives - helping them deal positively with change. My thinking has been sparked in countless ways as I read it and I'm already planning to use it with clients. Loved the ""how to"" of targeted innovation - clear explanation, easy to use! And the annotated bibliography is a bonus."
3,sox,"the sox are not what I was looking for, too tight and the top of the sox just turned under, did not make a full hem. This makes them tight on the ankle. The service was good as was the price and we gave them away. Not your fault, I am just fussy."
2,I wish it was written better because it has GREAT concepts!,"I absolutely love the title and idea of this book. I believe the concepts the author is trying to get across would be very helpful, too - if only I could read the darn thing. The format of this and his other book ""Being Me, Loving You"" is simply a description of what is happening on stage at one of his seminars and his dialogue with audience members. I find it very confusing. I've tried a handful of times to pick out what he's trying to say, but I'm finally donating this book to the library, where hopefully somebody else will find it more suiting to their needs than mine. I am still interested enough in the concept of NVC that I'm going to look for other books on the subject and maybe give his other book a try, if it' written in a different format. These two books, however, were a huge disappointment."
1,pamphlet which is the same as all the others,This is not a book it is a pamphlet and it is the same almost word for word as all the other pamphlet that this author puts out.
2,The foam is just plain hard,"It is not memory foam (I have a memory foam pillow) and, if your legs are shorter than the pillow, the ""dip"" will leave your feet dangling (I am 5'5""--not extremely short). You can take the foam wedge out (hence the ""adjustable""), but it makes very little difference. How you would fit this under a blanket, I have no idea. Might as well just use pillows.Have just become aware that I have to send this back by post office for $28, due to it's bulkiness....make sure you want this thing before you buy it, because the seller does not pay for return postage!"
1,Not as described or expected,"Be very careful and read all reviews before purchasing this item. It is NOT returnable and not what I expected. It's uncomfortable and no matter how much adjusting I did (removal of one of the foam wedges) it does not hit me anywhere near a comfortable position. This is made for a 6 foot tall Man... not a 5'5 woman. Very disappointed to say the least. Will not be purchasing again from this vendor and going to walk this thing out to the curb for pick-up. 87.00 down the drain. Live and learn. Also, this is not beige, it is white-white. Just a clunky, heavy, uncomfortable, useless piece of junk."
5,Nice pillow for lifting legs,This pillow is pretty solid foam and holds up well under the weight of your legs. The angle is just right for elevating your legs above your heart. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a pillow to elevate your legs.
5,Love it!,"This memory foam pillow is very comfortable. It stays in place thru the night, even when I turn to sleep on my side.I have circulatory discomfort, and after sleeping with this pillow my legs feel very rested when I wake in the morning."
2,Decent - Not great,"First off, the cover is NOT terry. It's made of a VERY stiff cloth.Second, there is NO give in the foam - it is extremely hard.I slept on it last night, and was not thrilled with it. Actually had a hard time sleeping.The picture makes it look like there is a slight dip in the middle, where your ankles are - there is not. It is so hard, and not comfortable. Maybe if you sleep on top of the covers, it might be better.As an ""off note"" - it's not beige, it's definately white. I'm almost thinking I got the wrong pillow.Would definately NOT recommend this product to other people."
1,Crap doesn't begin to describe this,Stick to the major releases of The Secret Machines. Thank God the best musicians left to form The Secret Machines. I wouldn't even waste the money to make this a cupholder or a frisbee. DON'T BUY THIS!
4,Global Metal,"I loved Metal: A Headbanger's Journey, and although this wasn't quite as good, as with the first film, I could have watched another hour or two easily. It's interesting to see different cultures interpreting metal in their own way and like Headbanger's Journey, Sam Dunn has made another great film about a still misunderstood genre of music. Can't wait until his next film. The Maiden film is fantastic as well."
3,He didn't do his homework!,"If you are someone like myself who is into the scene of these places this is not the film for you. Sam picks some of the well known bands from these places. For me I was hoping he would have done more homework and put in the film some bands that where more underground to help out the scene in these places because all these places have great bands that people need to know about. If you look at the film for more of anthropological approach than it's not bad. As I said I was not looking for that. I was hoping for not so well known bands to be in this movie. Like GxSxD, SSORC, Abigail, Fenrisulf, Rusuah, etc. If you don't know the scene than this movie will be for you."
5,"Great Price, Great Product",My mother-in-law swears by this moisturizer! She's 94 and looks 60! Getting more difficult to find for her without going to several stores. So glad I could purchase it here in the quantity she wanted and a better price!!
3,Don't bother,"Well, if you're in to music from the 40's and 50's, you'll like one or two of these tracks. Tight vocal harmonies, but the mediocre musicianship in much of the accompaniment and the stilted and repetitive orchestration gets old quickly. The trombone accompaniment is.... well, a C+ at best. Sharp, loud, brassy and obtrusive. Clashes with the nice vocals.I gave it a good listen, then threw it in the trash. I hate to be so critical, but... yuck.There are many other groups from this time period that are significantly better. The Four Freshmen are too fresh for my tastes. But maybe it's just me."
2,Yuck!,My 18 month old loves all the Baby E stuff. My son loves the puppets and the pictures of real objects like peas and oranges.He hates the clowns and crayons! The animated parts are awful. Why did they change a perfect format?
4,shapes for toddlers,"a little different than the other baby einstein videos. has a 3d type clown that is used i suppose in replacement of the puppets they usually have. a good watch nonetheless. there is a great presentation of shapes for toddlers and young children to learn. these are basic shapes, rectangle, square, circle, etc. the most elaborate being the oval. probably good for kids 4 and under. actually most of the einsteins are. if you kids know the shapes they will be bored with this more than watching it probably the first time through. good for teaching and learning for kids without the skill of knowing shapes"
1,"Out of all the BE dvds, this one is the worst","This one is just awful - awful music, awful animation (think of early 80's computer animations and you won't be far off). I don't find this in the least bit interesting and more importantly, neither does my daughter. Most BE dvds are fun to watch together. Not this one."
1,Scary and Weird,"We have the Baby Mozart and Baby Van Gogh (the best) from this series, and I was interested to see how Disney would make it better. Well, was I shocked when I got this tape. The 3D clown is freaky. The original songs are terrible -- and the same one recycled, completely repeated, twice during the 30 minutes. And I was a little shocked that characters for young children dig a hole and then jump in! Get Baby Van Gogh or a Baby Laureate tape, but do yourself a favor and pass this one up."
3,Computer Animation (not Pixar quality) Makes this a Dud!,I was very disappointed in this video/DVD. It ride the name recognition factor of the company. The show strays from the original format of Mozart and Bach. While I like to see innovation (like Neptune and Galileo) this one is so off the path I found recommend to other parents to skip this DVD and try Brainy Baby series.
1,Not the same as the other Baby Einstein videos.,My 16 month old just does not like this video. It is very different from the others. I will certainly keep trying it on him as he matures. I guess we expected it to change from the computer animation to the real life and puppets that we are all so accustomed to at some point in the video but it never happens. I would just caution the buyer to be aware that is not a typical Baby Einstein video.
2,I totally agree with Texas fan!,"We, too own all of the Baby Einstein videos. I was so excited to see a new one released. My 16 month old son LOVES them, especially Shakespeare and Van Gogh because of the kids and puppets. I was surprised to see that Disney released it instead of FHE, like the others. Anyway, it was awful and my son screamed for me to turn it off after 10 minutes. What happened to the kids? The music was loud and annoying. The animated crayons and shapes were so unfriendly and uninviting. I am really dissapointed! I only saw one familiar puppet, the horse from Doolittle's neighborhood animals. The rest all looked new to me. If you are reading this Julie Clark (creator) go back to the old way of making these videos! I will hesitate to buy another!"
2,Very Disappointed...,"We are big fans of the Baby Einstein Company and were very disappointed when we watched this video. It has some of the elements of the previous productions, but was too flashy and had more of the quality of your run of the mill video. We liked the previous videos because they were simple and babies could relate to them. Here we have expensive production elements that distract from the learning of shapes."
1,Horrible music - video scares my 1 yr old,"I rented this video on Netflix and I had to send it back right away because my son cried every time the walking pencil characters carved a hole in the ground and fell through it. He also fussed throughout the video at different intervals. In addition to him not liking it, I couldn't stand it. The music was horrible! ""I know my shapes"" ? I hope I never meet the person who wrote that song."
2,Very Disappointing,"If you like high-tech cartoons, you may like this. But if you do, you're probably already old enough to know your shapes! If you've grown to love the ridiculously low-tech but charming puppets, toys, and classical music of the usual Baby Einstein format, Baby Newton is sure to disappoint. While most of the Baby Einstein series has a format that's simple and more appropriate for the youngest kids (0-3 yrs), Baby Newton is just another computerized cartoon like everything else out there on television or video/DVD. Further, I cannot figure out how they call this 49 minutes of play time -- it seems more like 20. Buy other Einsteins instead. I feel ripped off!"
5,Another Hit in Our Home,"The Baby Newton video seems like the natural progression for my 15 month old from her other favorites (Mozart & Dolittle). Since we have watched each of those videos over and over it seems like she was outgrowing them a little. Now with this new video, our daughter is again glued to the screen watching the various shapes come alive. Thank you Baby Einstein for developing a video better suited for my growing (and now even smarter) daughter."
1,HORRIBLE - Don't waste your money!!,"Oh please!... don't waste your time or money on this video. Baby Einstein has really gone downhill! Their first few videos were maybe a 2 star rating, but now it's repetitive junk images of nothing! In fact, your baby doesn't learn a thing from ANY of the Einstein videos. They just TV Veg on nothing. The newest line of videos are even worse! Please don't subject your child to this nonsense. I believe in using some of these video tools for early childhood education, but there are FAR better choices you can make than anything Einstein makes."
1,My Child Cried Also!,"I previously posted this video as a 3 star rating by mistake. But I have to say, if the video scares and makes my child cry, I'm certainly not going to show it to him. Hence, it gets only one star from me, no matter how well done the other segments are.I certainly cannot recommend it."
2,Straying from a good formula,"What was unique about the Baby Einstein series of tapes was that they used real-life objects along with classical music to create a world already familiar to young minds.So, of course, they have to eliminate much of the real-life objects in lieu of digital animation, and replace the classical music with new children's songs.Our toddlers watch the tape, but don't get into it as much as Julie Clark's two Baby Dolittle tapes.If you get it as a gift, you won't want to return it - but it certainly isn't worth paying full price for."
1,Awful -- Don't waste your money,"This one is terrible. The clown is off-putting. My kids preferred the puppets in the other Einstein DVDs. The song is repeated too many times. Buy Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Noah, or Neptune instead."
2,Disappointed,"I'm usually not resistent to change...however, after viewing this video I'm reminded of the old saying ""if ain't broke, don't fix it"". This video mainly consist of animations and fast paced lyrics that are almost unintelligible--clearly a departure from Mrs. Clark's previous productions. The puppets and classical music appeared to have added as an afterthought...perhaps to appease long time fans. If Baby Newton is going to be the new standard, then I will not be purchasing future products."
1,Simply Awful,"My daughter, who loves the other (pre-Disney) Baby Einstein videos, cried (16 months). We put it away for a few months and tried again (at 20 months) -- and she cried again (at the same spot). It's scary, moves much more quickly than the other videos, and seems like a ... knock-off of the real thing (even the toys and puppets look cheesy). The ""original"" song is dumb, and even the classical portion of the sound track sounds bad (as in, poor quality recording and mixing). Don't waste your money. This is Baby Einstein sells out."
2,Dissapointed!,"The old adage of ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" applies. I had this DVD pre-ordered for months. I was so eager to share it with my little one, but what a dissapointment. Disney's involvement took Julie Clark's amazing idea and design and changed it for the worse."
2,Disappointing,"Baby Newton is nothing like the original series (i.e., Baby Bach, Baby Mozart, etc.) ... My 21-month absolutely loves the Baby Einstein series. We bought her the Baby Newton, and she could care less. She doesn't giggle, she doesn't dance and she doesn't sing to this one. In fact, she'll pop it out of the VHS and grab a different tape! I'm very disappointed with this one."
4,Works like the rest,My 1 year old son loves this video -- even though it's been 'disney-ized'. With the exception of the crayon and clown animation it's the same type of stuff from the other baby einstein videos that's kept your child busy for that precious 30 minutes while you're eating dinner.
1,Not up to par with the others...,We own all Baby Einstein videos and my daughter loves them all except this one. I agree with the other review - the clown was creepy and the music wasn't great. I wish I had skipped this one.
1,The same old thing just got worse,"I quite enjoy a few from the Einstein selection with both of my children, 18 months and almost 4. We don't watch them as often as Blue's Clue's or Baby Know-It-All, but the mesmerizing images are sometimes great for bedtime, especially Van Gogh, and Mozart.When we saw this one we were absolutely disappointed. Up until now, we've come to expect more of the same thing just done a little differently from Baby Einstein. That was fine, because we tend to get sick of watching one of the series to much. but, Newton is different, and in this case, we would have preferred more of the same. The animation is not really interesting, even to the over 2 years crowd, which it is too slow for. That something that this series had is no longer there. We gave it away 2 weeks after buying it. With videos like Baby KNow-It-All, you get solid edu-tainment, and blues Clues you get creative edu-tainment through cartoons. With Mozart you get a quiet baby, with Newton you get nothing."
1,Very Disappointed,"My son and I love all the Baby Einstein videos (with the exception of Baby Bach) and we were really looking forward to the release of Baby Newton. This video does not follow the same format as the other videos in this series. There is an animated ""clown"" as the main character as well as animated dancing crayons. There is very little classical music ,a few puppet shows, and no children. This video did not hold my son's attention and I really wish I would have previewed it before I invested my money in it! What a dissapointment!!!!"
2,Pass on this one!,"Lacks the classical magic of the original series. It's been replaced with computer animation and made up songs about shapes. The puppets are still nice, but it's missing the original concepts for baby einstein."
2,Disney-fied fun,"The main difference between this video and its predecessors is that Baby Newton is much more similar to any other Disney product: faster cuts, computer generated animation, and more pop-oriented music. My 16 month old son seems to like it, but it seems less educational than the earlier titles in the series"
1,Leave this one,"My daughter loves her 5 other Baby Einstein DVDs and would probably sit for hours and watch them if I'd let her. However, she will not sit for longer than 5 minutes for this one. She loves the puppets on the other DVDs, but the format on Baby Newton is different. There are not many puppets and there is a lot of animation, which is not the case with the others. The music is terrible. Maybe she's just not old enough for this video (she's one). I wish I had read the reviews before I picked this one up. If you like the other Baby Einsteins, such as Neigborhood Animals, Baby MacDonald, Baby Neptune, don't bother with this one."
3,VHS Sound is Muddled - my daughter still loves it though,"We own EVERY Baby Einstien video. My daughter has been watching them since she was probably about 3 months old and LOVES them!!! I've only had one problem with one of the videos, and it's the Baby Newton video. We own the VHS version, not the DVD....and the sound is all muddled. Has anyone else experienced that? I managed to acquire two VHS versions of Baby Newton via gift, and they both had the same sound issue. I wonder if the DVD is any better. I admit, I abhor the cheesey song and wish that they used more classical music in this video, but all that's really important is that my daughter likes the video and learns her shapes from it."
1,The WORST Baby Einstein I've Seen,"It's horrible! There is WAY too much computer animation. Plus, repeating an entire segment/song is not a good idea for young children -- that's boring. I thought we needed every Baby Einstein DVD. But I was wrong. My daughter would much rather watch some of her other Baby Einsteins than this one. Don't waste your money!"
3,Still worth it,"We also own all of the Baby Einstein videos. My 2-year old son adores all of them (including Baby Newton) except for Baby Einstein. I am glad that I did not heed the negative reviews. My son was an instant fan of Baby Newton and asked for it over and over again for days. As a parent, I do agree that the classic Baby Einstein series was better left alone. Both my son and I enjoy the kids, and puppets from the other titles in the series. However, I am happy that we chose to purchase this title as it is still good for 1/2 hour of undisturbed adult mealtime."
2,Fails to captivate child's attention,"My two daughters (2.5 years and 9 months old) have enjoyed every previous release of the Baby Einstein collection. As soon as the video starts playing, they are hypnotised and remain fixed in the presentation, frequently laughing and describing what they see.However, the latest release of Baby Newton has not captivated their attention at all. It seems like the old formula of using everyday objects was far more successful. The special effects in the new version failed the viewers test."
4,great dvd,"works greatlove the french language option because i'm french and want my son to learn it,he is 7 months and loves all the baby einstein movies"
2,Dirty,When item arrived the the was damaged and it belonged to a library it looked as it should have been garbage
1,not like the others,"I too have all the Baby Einstien DVDs and was so excited to have a new one. I was greatly disappointed to see the departure form the usual format including a loud shape song and less puppetry. I had thought the animation would be a plus but it sure wasn't my 2 1/2 year old, 18 month old and 8 month old were quickly bored and went on to other toys."
5,unnecessary quibbling on great infant/toddler entertainment,"My son has been watching this from when it came out, and while he is now three, he still enjoys the video. He totally loves the animated clown, just as he enjoyed the toy commercials of the rest of the videos :-) Isaac the lion is totally adorable, and I much prefer that he watch this rather than grow up too quickly and watch Toy Story et. al.He learned all of his shapes and COLORs too from watching this video after just a couple of times watching. We watch all DVDs together always, and about those complaints on 2D tags for 3D images, watch with your child! fold laundry near them, and ask them questions and talk about what you watch. And its a good thing to recognize that a pyramid is made up of triangles and so on. After watching the video, he was able to recognize the 2D shapes underlying objects in our 3D world. This video IS a great addition to the series. This is teaching a toddler simple concepts, NOT teaching a 7 year old geometry."
3,Baby Einstein - Baby Newton,"Quite different from their normal format, though my 20 month old still seems to like it. The computer animation seems very amaturish and the transitions between segments are not as smooth (in tone) as most of the other Baby Einstein DVDs we have. I particularly dislike the Home Depot product placement in one of the segments. What a HUGE turn-off."
1,Don't waste your money,"As other reviewers have said, why mess with what works; and the real world items chosen were terrible and too few. The abstract animation used to show the shapes was awful. The dancing crayons were lame. My son kept turning away from the TV during the show...and he's a huge Baby E fan. This is simply painful to watch after the other Baby E successes. The Baby E creators should be embarassed by this production."
1,Cry-inducing,"As someone else said, this DVD has terrified my 17-mo. old daughter. I know children will react differently, but we can't even put it in anymore -- the scene with the dog being pelted by balls terrifes her and has scared her for DAYS now. She will not stop walking around saying, ""bye, bye, doggie"" while crying. I concur with others, too, about the low-rent quality of this DVD. It's boring and not as interesting as many of the others. Not worth the money."
2,Not recommended - one of the worst in the series !,"Baby Newton is about shapes. However, this DVD is not able to sustain my 15 mth old son's interest. My boy would probably just glance for couple of seconds when this dvd is playing and then do something else. Compared to the other dvds in the series, Baby Newton has got one of the slowest paced music in the background (which i consider boring) and the dvd is mostly about animated crayons that dance and form shapes.If you are wondering which ones in the series to get, I would recommend world animals, neighbourhood animals and van gogh as these 3 have very lively music and are very entertaining to watch - at least they are able to sustain my 15 mth old son's interest."
1,I am glad not the first one,My son seems to likes parts of this video but not nearly like any of the others. Baby Mozart is by far the best one of the series. Any of the other DVD's work to keep my sons attention. If Baby Newton were the first one we had purchased we never would not have bought anymore. Maybe when my son is older he will like this one better. But at 1 year he has no interest. I would not waste my money on this one for a younger baby. You are better off getting Baby Mozart or one of the Baby Dolittles.
1,Disappointing,"Agree with the other reviewers. This one fails to engage my daughter, and I found it lacking charm. Save your money."
2,It's not Baby Einstein any more,"Personally, I was mildly excited about Disney buying the BabyEinstien company. They had more resources to develop moreproducts and bring them to market, perhaps faster. AFamily-oriented entertainment company buying an infant-orientedentertainment company. It made sense.Unfortunately, they have effectively killed Baby Einstein.Instead of a video of ""real world objects"" they have gonecomputer-generated. Ok, the intro is classic Baby Einsteinstuff, but that's where it ends. It is not recognizable as aBaby Einstein DVD after the intro.Get Baby Mozart & Baby Bach for your very young infant. Theywill love it and you have a built-in 20 minute baby sitter soyou can eat dinner. Both of my twins LOVE these.Add Baby Shakespeare, Baby Santa and the Baby Doolittles whenyour baby reaches 6 to 10 months. I used-to consider the BabyEinstein tape the dog of the bunch, but that distinction isnow reserved for Baby Newton."
1,A little too much help from Big Ol' Disney-,"What a major disappointment- I felt cheated for my triplets- they are 18 months and afraid of most of the animation and characters. We miss the ""kithcy"" feel that the previous videos had. Sure hope the Clark family has more say in the production of new releases! Get back to basics...!"
3,Does Disney know their shapes?,This video is different from the others. Less puppet interaction which is a bummer. My biggest concern is that they confuse oval and circle and square and rectangle.
4,Two Thumbs Up!!!,"My babies are about 22 months old and just love these videos. This video keeps them hooked with sounds, music, shapes and colors. This along with constant movement really keep the children focused. They learn without even realizing it which makes this a great video for young children."
5,We Love It!,"A wooden, portable activity arch is a wonderful baby toy! So many activity mats sold in the US are so bright and busy they totally overstimulate a baby. This is a beautiful, well-made arch. All of the toys are detachable, so you can introduce one at a time. Also, you can remove the plush toys and hang other grasping toys. My 3 month old son loves the arch. His favorite thing to grasp right now is one of those plastic ""Live Strong"" bracelets suspended from some C-clips from the activity arch. (He also really loves the crinkle worm that comes with the arch.) Other wooden arches that you can modify and change out are sold (see theMusinaby Selecta and theDangle & Drapeby Haba), but this is not only the best I found (and most easily modified), but is also the least expensive. A total winner!"
5,great old movie,classic comedy with big time actors or actresses later on in life.....edgar g ropbinson is the best here.... bumbling crooks go straight satire and can't get it right anyhow
4,xzibit got skillz,this is the shit as was his first album. the album is so sick because xzibit has the kind of lyrics and beatz that just make ya bounce ya head to it.if you want some mad undergrond west coast shit go get this.cant wait for his new album the restless.
5,The new Los Angeles King,"XZ has the raw funk vibe that makes an MC great. His flow is rough as sandpaper and well crafted and put together. Likwit Crew(Alkaholiks,Defari,Xzibit,KIng T) are establishing lyrical dominace over their neighbors in L.A. This album combines the hardcore drums, and semi-spooky keyboards that define gangsta rap and puts a twist to it. The result shines best on Killa Cali classics like ""what U see is what U get"", ""3 card Molly"" and ""P# Pop""."
4,xzibits album is mad hot listen to recycled assasins,"the source gotta open their eyes to this site and take notes. stop givin Mase and all them feather weight lyricists xzibit's, raskass's and black star's hard earned mics. 40 Dayz and 40 Nightz ain't perfect but it's worth your 12 bux and then sum."
3,Could have been better,"I was a bit disappointed with this CD.....i thought the beats could have been better and also the lyrics from some of tha songs, but no doubt, im satisfied with tha purchase and whenever he comes out with anotha, i would buy it."
4,Xzibit goes from underground to mainstream.,In my opinion Xzibit is one of the more talented lyricists. He combines intensity with creativity to give his listeners a piece of his life in every verse. I like Xzibit's sound and I'm glad he represents the WESTCOAST.
4,Xzibit New Piece Acclerates Hip Hop Pass the Speed of Life,"Xzibit's new albulm is a step forward for hip hop. He step's over all the lastest hip hop trends and comes with orginal and good music. He is one of a few mc's which speaks his mind and not everyone elses. He is true to himself when he writes his lyrics. Although his new albulm may not be considered one of the all-time greats, it will be looked at one of the most real albulms out there."
4,good collection,"I've always been fond of '60s music, and when I saw that this collection contained both ""Have I The Right?"" and ""Go Now,"" I jumped at the chance to get it.I came into the purchase with the expectation that it might be a little uneven...which it was. There were, however, some pleasant surprises, such as ""Walking Back to Happiness"" and Gerry and the Pacemakers' version of ""You'll Never Walk Alone.""All in all, I quite enjoyed it."
4,"Liszt: The Schubert Transcriptions, Vol.3","Leslie Howard has shown an impressive insight into these pieces (as he has with volumes 2 and 3 of the Schubert transcriptions) and generally performs them very well. As with the series as a whole, the recording is superb. As many of the pieces on these three discs are otherwise unavailable, it is impossible to compare them with other interpretations, but I believe in this case that Mr Howard would compare favorably with the best of them."
4,Much Better than Expected,"The garish cover put me off this book for too long. Garnett has done her homework and the setting is accurate and convincing. Her characters, although relatively familiar, are nonetheless fully fleshed and interesting. The story mixes historical fact and fancy deftly and you don't lose interest. This is an above average romance, a good historical novel and a fun read."
3,Different!,"This was my first novel by Ms. Garnett. The detail to history, although was excellent and informative, may be tedious for some. The plot was well spoken, and the characters well developed. This book did take time to go through, because it is chalk full of details, the story was interesting, but the ending a little weak I thought. All in all though, I would give this author another read."
3,Not the best Scottish romance I've read,"This book was okay, but I have definitely read better novels about Scotland and the middle ages. The characters didn't seem realistic, and I didn't feel there was enough description. I couldn't picture the Scottish countryside, though the descriptions of the interior of Castle Rock were fairly good."
3,mediocre,"Last year, for some odd reason I did not finish this book. Know I know why I did not finish. This book was very easy to put down-and let me tell you I do not like to do that. I gave it three stars because it did have potential, but I gave up on it."
4,Very cool book,"Really like the style of this counting book. With the black and white visuals opening up to colourful animal popups. Just one error would be the 10 shows as a 0 before it is opened...which is a bit confusing ...7,8,9,0?"
5,a delightful introduction to numbers for young and old,"How lucky for children and adults that Chuck Murphy puts his considerable creative talents to the service of young children. All of his books are quiet little masterpieces, and One to Ten Pop-Up Surprises is one of the best.Stark black and white numbers are lifted to reveal colorful frogs and birds, bugs and butterflies, cats, dogs, seashells and even little boys and girls. Three of the ten manipulatives are tabs, which are more difficult for young children, but any adult would be eager to help out with this beautiful book.Our two-year old eagerly yells out each number and then counts the revealed objects. With this gorgeous teaching aid, learning is not only painless, but a pleasure."
4,"No need to insult the reader, is there?","The book is an easy read. The case studies in Part III are very helpful. Unfortunately, it takes 179 pages to get to them.The main problem, in my opinion, is Part I, where the author breaks the rule she later spells out on page 173: ""Nobody likes to be treated like an idiot. A patronizing air or condescending tone will get you resentment instead of cooperation."" Part I is rife with instances where the author (playfully?) injects snide comments about the reader.Reading this book will not be a waste of your time, but you may want to read just Part III. If you are looking to solve problems with coworkers, other books that may help are ""Dealing With People You Can't Stand"", and ""Working With You is Killing Me""."
2,careless research,"It is quite surprising that someone writing a book on Napoleon is so careless as to mix up Napoleon's brothers. He twice refers to Lucien as King of Holland (pages 10 and 109. Of course, it was Napoleon's brother Louis who was King of Holland. The only reference to Louis is as the father of Napoleon III. I assumed The page 10 error was merely a typo. When it was repeated on page 109, I realized that this was not a well-researched book, ans so I put it down at that point."
3,Slim Recap,"I found this book to be a useful introduction to one of history's most infamous icons. It is to be enjoyed as a vast overview of Napoleon's life, not as an in-depth account.The portion of the book I found most interesting was Johnson's theory regarding how Napoleon breathed nationalist life into the Germans. Until then, the Holy Roman Empire structure kept in balance a potentially dangerous people. When Napoleon turned away their talents from art and scholarship and towards military organization, the consequences were felt for the next 125 years.This book was not dazzling in style but was still an interesting read."
1,Completely biased and unorganized,"The book from the beginning is absolutely biased. I read through the first few chapters, thinking it would stop soon, or thinking that I had misinterpretted the authors intentions. However, it does not stop! Curious, I looked at the author's information and sure enough he is British. He is writing a book about a person who, to him, is no more of an asset to humanity than the plague. How can he be considered a historian?Furthermore, the book was extremely unorganized. Instead of proceeding in a chronological order, the author narrates haphazardly, skipping from one subject to the other as he fancies. Just because he though of a new reason why he hates Napoleon does not mean he can just write whatever he wants in a historical record."
1,Biased,Paul Johson's book is too biased to be considered serious scholarship. See reviews below for specific examples.
2,Generousity means 2 stars - in this case,"I totally agree with one of the reviewers that this ""Napoleon"" book should not be taken seriously. Why??? It is hilarious! The writer talks about 1790's just as if he lived in 1790's! This plus the vivid descriptions of Napoleon's sex life makes this book too funny to take it seriously or use it as a historical study.If I have bought this book from Fiction shelves I would have definitely rate it 5 stars because it's a great work of fiction!"
1,lost balance,"If you hate Napoleon you will love this book. If you love Napoleon you will hate this book. If you are looking for unbiased writing, you won't find it in Mr. Johnsons offering. The vituperative character assaults start in the introduction, and are laced throughout. This is a simplistic rehash of contemporary negative propoganda from Napoleons enemies, and in no way should be taken as a serious historical study. There is no sense of a balanced viewpoint. Every negative inuendo and rumour finds its way into this book, and are presented as fact. The title should have read ""I Hate Napoleon"", and is an example of slander at its nastiest."
4,A solid brief biography,I wanted a readable Napoleon biography. This is my second attempt at that goal. This book made Napoleons life understandable and debunked some of the hero worship that seems common in some of the other biographies. The intrigue involved in Napoleon's time in power is worth the read alone.A fine readable biography.
5,Brilliant Phillipic,"The people who don't like this book call it biased and lacking depth. These are the very qualities that make it a brilliant polemic that is really directed at the thinking of our times rather than an assessment of the past. What Johnson is really attacking is the sloppy romanticism that excuses dictators of their crimes due to their image as men of action. This form of thug chic most malevolently manifests itself in liberal bourgeois societies where so called progressive types are beguiled by the Hitlers, Lenins, Stalins, Maos, Castros, Ortegas and Saddams of the world.Yes, Johnson goes for the throat and holds back nothing. It needed doing."
2,Sloppy prejudice passing as objectivity,"This ""biography"" is so stuffed with sloppy inaccuracies that it's hard to know where to begin. To take two examples at either end: in Chapter 1 we are told that Bonaparte's brother Luicen became King of Holland! For Johnson's information, it was Louis. Final chapter: we're informed that while on St Helena Napoleon befriended the young Betsy Briars. Her name was Betsy Balcombe -""The Briars"" was the name of her father's house. To carry on listing all such factual errors would require too much time and space for a book so little deserving in either. Johnson is a die-hard British snob who is determined to debunk Napoleon at all costs, including historical accuracy."
4,Bib prevents stains,"The white color means the bib itself does get stained, but at least the shirt underneath is spared. The length helps catch lap crumbs. My father's caregiver has trouble with the snaps - they are stiff. She thinks a velcro closure would be better. We like the plasticized backing as it helps keep the soup on the front of the bib instead of letting it penetrate to clothing."
5,just one sour note...,"I really don't have nothing more positive to add compared to two previous reviews which speak for itself. The book proves to be everything they stated. However, I would like to add this train of thought which may sound bit negative but something for author to considered in the future. For one, it needs a map. Imperial Japan isn't one of these geographical places many Americans really know about. Maps and diagrams would have been greatly helpful. Second, more photos of historical characters in the book. It would be nice to have faces to go with the names - most who were total unknown to most Americans. I am surprised considering the research involved in this book that Mr. Keene could not add more photos even although he writes about them in the book. Otherwise, the previous two reviews proves to be very accurate. Top notch book that combined biographical as well as historical evolution of the Meiji Emperor and his reign."
5,Great book,"Great perspective into the life and times of one of the most influencial characters in Japanese history.This book will not only give insight into the life of Japans royalty but a good look at that period of history. Easy to read, no previous knowledge of Japanese history or culture needed cause the book tells ya everything youll need and want to know about this time. It is alot longer then the average book, 800 pages or so, (the other 300 is notes and index), but fast moving enough to keep ya interested. Author does make alot of assumptions at times though.I found the book pretty balanced, but if yur one of the many people who just read books on Japan to bash the Japanese, ya might want to go somewhere else as it doesnt spent much time on social commentary for ya to rip on."
5,Loved the humor! It worked for a dark subject!,"When I bought this book I was unsure as to whether or not the whole business of being in a mental institution would be very funny. Well, somehow or other, treating the subject without pity and a poor me attitude made the story stronger. I felt for the people-- I didn't laugh at them-- it was more the absurdity and self-loathing we all feel in everyday life that came through."
5,Very good,"I am a swedish boy (16) who has read Holocaust. I think its a very good book, very serious and sad. Its a bit imberising readuíng it. Sweden didn't help the judish people. Sorry... The book is fabulous"
3,Yes Sir I Can Boogie,Very groovie disco hit from late 70's (one of the best from this era).It makes me move and dance every time i hear it.
3,One complaint about this DVD...,"Overall, this is a great DVD. My only compaint is that there is no option to ""play all"" features. Also, there is a prologue before each feature that you can't bypass. It is very informational; however, I bought this as a background video for a western party and wanted to have it play through all 4 movies. You can't do this the way it comes. You have to select each feature individually and fast forward through the prologues."
3,Silent Classic Deserves a Better Print,"Though it's great to have William S. Hart's ""Tumbleweeds"" on DVD, the overall print quality is disappointing. Fortunately, I still own the Blackhawk Films videocassette, which features an excellent transfer and Hart's poignant 1939 introduction. Why Image Entertainment did not use the untinted Blackhawk print remains a mystery. One hopes this 1925 classic will receive the full restoration it so richly deserves."
5,The first American Movie,"Its hard to believe but this film was made more than 100 hundred years ago,it has to be considered to be a technical step forward for its time. The plot is basicilly a train robbery. It is also the first western. This was a stepping stone for what movies could be, D.W Griffth pushed even farther with the first epic with a Birth Of A Nation."
3,Ol' time western,This is a great example of 'hokie' silent movies. The Train Robbery is VERY SHORT. Fortunately there are 2 other movies included. One story is a classic of the poor orphans and their new family's acceptance. The expressions and makeup are hilarious. All turns out for the best in the end.
2,You get what you paid for.,I wasn't impressed with this pillow. It's cheap however that was kind of the point. I bought this for a tooth fairy trip and don't plan on using it more than once.
5,Excellent,Grandaughter still watches this after a year. Especially good before bedtime - has a relaxing effect.
4,Julie's voice is perfect for this!,"I don't know what the big deal is about Julie Clark's voice. I think it's perfect because she sounds childlike and the poetry should sound more like nursery rhymes, otherwise small children wouldn't be interested in what's being said. As far as her having a nasal sound, I don't agree, but for those of you that think that, here's some insight, some of the best recording artists have a nasal sound. I think people prefer something different than plain old generic and boring! I think Julie's voice is becoming trademark. Do we have some jealous people out there?My seven month old loves this video as she does Mozart. I can understand why this one is geared toward older toddlers, it's a little faster paced and she can't understand what's being said, but she still loves the toys and puppet. I have no doubt that in time, she will learn the words and what's being said."
1,Violent images and a repeat of previous videos,This video is just a repeat of images found in Baby Mozart and Baby Einstein. I also was surprised and displeased by the violence portrayed in the video. My daughter (18 mos) who still enjoys the other two videos walked away in the frist 5 minutes of watching this.
1,Waste of money,"There are better things you could spend your money on. Like a real classical music cd which you put into your own stereo and act out with your child. I was so sorry we invested our money into something I could have created myself. Maybe if I had paid... like most videos of this quality cost, I wouldn't be so negative but the cost of this set was way overpriced on the good. Pick up some puppets and interact with your child yourself. Buy some flashcards if you wish as well. Your child will enjoy that time more than having some faceless voice speaking to them on TV. They stare enough at the boob tube as it is.This won't make your child smarter. Only the parent themselves can do that by encouraging their kids to actively learn, by reading to them and being very involved in their children's schooling years."
3,Five Stars for Girls. One Star for Boys.,"I'm a total feminist, in the most positive sense of the word. But my little girl (1 1/2) is so much more interested in this video than was my son (2 1/2) at the same age.She giggles, and laughs, and slaps her knees. Her rapt attention contrasts sharply with my son's ambivalence (and sometimes tantrums) when this video is on. My daughter, in fact, has little interest in any of the other typical videos (Barney, Blue's Clues, and other of the Baby Einstein videos). For her, I am overjoyed that this video was made. I hope there are more forthcoming, being a literature major myself.For girls -- awesome.For boys -- not so much."
5,Baby Shakespeare,This Video is excellent! My daughter loves it! I was suprised that at 13mos she sits/dances thru the whole thing glued to the TV. She dances to the music and is entertained by the toys and puppets. As she gets older I am sure that the poetry will entertain her as well. This video not only has enterainment value but has educational value as well. The combinations of words and objects are wonderful. I highly recommend this video to anyone with children.
5,love these videos!,"I own 3 baby einstein videos now and I have no complaints about any of them. My 14 m/o loves to watch them over and over. This is our newest one and she watched it 3 times in a row! It really keeps her occupied, unlike other videos like 'baby's first video' and 'So Smart Sights and Sounds'. Baby Einstein is the way to go!"
5,As good as...,"...""YALTSTM""!!!Perfect Band with a very very unique sound!!! The last album with Craig Walker as frontman :-(dude"
1,Won't print out results,"One of the most amazing things about this product is that you are not able to print your results. If you want to print out all of your charitable contributions for 2005, you are out of luck. Technology is 15 years behind any other software on market."
1,No Improvement Over Money 2004,"Purchased Microsoft Money 2006 Premium as an upgrade to my Money 2004. Did the same with Money 2005 last year but could not get it to run effectively (without crashing) so I uninstalled it and went back to Money 2004. Figured that Microsoft probably made a bunch of changes in the two years since Money 2004 so I took the leap to Money 2006. It migrated my data fine and runs without crashing but I am still in search of new functionality. I don't download account data from banks so if functional improvements were made in this area I am oblivious to them. I do know that the screen jumps when entering transactions in the portfolio summary - maybe something that can be patched by Microsoft before it is offered as a ""feature"" in Money 2007. Bottom line - if have Money 2004 or 2005 you may want to save your money as the features and functionality in Money 2006 are essentially the same."
3,What's new?,I have been using Money for years and use most of the features. After installing Money 2006 I had a difficult time finding anything different from the 2005 version. I think it is a good product but certainly not worth upgrading from the 2005 version. If you have 2005 version you might as well stick with it. I can't tell the difference between the two.
3,Be careful,"I have been using Microsoft Money since 1999, upgrading every year, and have been pleased until I upgraded to Money 2006. I noticed that the checks that I printed did not completely fill out on the ""dollars"" line. The ******* symbol only went a third of the way, this has not happened on any other version. I called Microsoft Technical Support and after three days of ""working on this issue"" they concluded that it was a problem with my HP Officejet 7210xi printer. I found that hard to believe since it worked fine with Money 2005."
1,Money 2006 Premium,"Have used Money for several years and recently upgraded from Money 2003. The data conversion appeared to go well, but the program ""lost"" several reporting functions. The graphics and ""reset"" buttons on the report customization menus are grayed out. However, graphics in the 'Monthly Report"" and in the lifetime planner work fine. MS suggestion was to create a new file and then export each account individually to the new file. With 125+ accounts that would be absurd. I did set up a small trial file with some minimal data and found all graphics functional. I still prefer the 2003 version but cannot go back now."
2,"Works -- but really, really slow.","This product works -- but is ridiculously slow.On my 2.4Ghz P4 machine:- Screen refreshes take multiple seconds.- Portfolio view changes can take 10-15 seconds.Please, Microsoft, FIX the performance. Assign a realdev team to re-architect it. Please."
3,Let down on international support,"While the software has much to be commended for, it is disappointment on two fronts 1) support on investments in the fastest developing countries like India and China where MSN does have a major presence and 2) does not include insurance as an asset as such, only in their lifetime planning section.Both these factors do not let you accurately track your investments, savings or retirement planning accurately.Otherwise, it is a great software given the depth of MSN's online involvement."
1,Dont believe in the rebate - u r not going to get $30 back,I have sent the necessary documents within a week from buying and receiving the box from this site - I submitted the rebate app on the young-america (vendor) website - it has been more than two months - no rebate yet. I checked on the young-america site and it says it couldnt even find my rebate application - very convenient for Microsoft and the vendor to not locate my app - how else they are going to make money??- Functionality wise - no improvement at all over MS Money 2004There is no rating below than one star otherwise I could have given it less than a star and if possible negative - not worth spending around $70 for the software
3,Money 2006 Premium,"Not as user friendly as Quicken and premium use has an expiration date unlike Quicken. If not for rebate I would have stayed with Quicken. Some financial sites I use won't download to Money, but will to Quicken."
2,Less stable than Money 2004,"Money 2004 never crashed on me, but I find 2006 does so quite often.I'm a little frustrated with not being able to view changes to the budget in the current month.From the help manual:""If your budget doesn't look balanced the first month, wait until next month to see if the problem goes away on its own.""Money 2006 hasn't got any simplier. In their attempt to simplify you now have 'basic' and 'advanced' modes to everything. This makes it more confusing and harder to find features."
1,Beware of Online Services,"This softeware is not ready for prime time. Microsoft is notorious for releasing software before it's debugged, but this may be a new low. I have spent the past 10 days with tech support types, trying to get Money to communicate with MSN and their Bill Pay service, without corrupting my files. The result: I am without ANY financial service that I can trust and still at their mercy."
1,I'm sorry that I upgraded from 2004,"Pretty, but no additional useful functionality. I hate the automating portfolio updating of stock prices everytime you start the program. Stock prices don't change between Friday and Monday, yet the program insists on downloading unchanged prices. The effect is unnecessary pause, after unnecessary pause, after unnecessary pause. There is a setting that is supposed to turn this off, but it doesn't! Calls and e-mails to technical support will get you anything except an answer. So, if you have a large financial database that has grown for several years, stick with Money 2004. Microsoft is only interested in new customers, loyal customers get stuck with a slow albatross. The Macintosh people have taken over!"
1,Almost Totally Useless....,"The bill paying / scheduling is not integrated with the 'accounts' ( not is the budget feature as far as I can tell...). I could not enter my existing mortgage information -- it insisted that the amounts were *wrong*. (Gee... perhaps I should tell that to my bank...).I cant link a scheduled payment with a credit card account (or loan account, etc...). There doesn't seem to be any way for it to automatically recognize payments (for example an electronic payment to citibank - you have to catagorize it yourself each and every month).I would say that half of the screens are nothing but advertising from various financial insitutions (who probably paid MS loads of money for the privledge).I'm going back to Quicken...."
1,Seems to be full of bugs,I can't speak generally of how this software works because I cannot get it to work properly. It will not connect to any bank accounts or credit card accounts. It just comes back with a useless error message. I have never had this problem with Quicken or previous versions of Money that I have used.
1,most frustrating program ever,"To be fair - I probably don't use this the ""normal"" way. I like to print checks. This seems like basic functionality. I used, supported, and written software that does this. But I have never worked with a program that was slower, less intuitive, nor more frustrating than Money. Since I have considerable data in it I keep trying (originally I had high hopes for it). There is no other program that can get me to curse at it - except Money. Unless you are forced to ... try something else ... anything else."
3,Neat Stuff! Campy and fun.,"This is quite a good movie about college nerds going to a bowling alley and releases an evil imp. Scream queens Linnea Quigley, Brinke Stevens, and Michelle (McLellan) Bauer all team up in this comedy-horror-fantasy movie and teamed up again in ""The Nightmare Sisters"" which is really hilarious and is by the same director, but it's nowhere as good as this. I think this movie was played in theatre's, if not it certainly was good enough to be."
5,eyes wide open,loved it. a real 80s classic movie and all the bee girls were in it.made me think of the good old days
3,"Not to be taken seriously, but a rather fun movie","If you want to watch a good movie, don't watch this. If you want to have some laughs with a few friends making fun of a movie that is both intentionally and unintentionally ridiculous, give this a try. The plot is minimal, and there are plot holes throughout. The dialog is also quite bad, but all of these things add up to a good silly time for those who like that kind of thing. Be prepared to feel like you're trapped inside an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, and have a laugh or two.As a side note, this sorority is the smallest in the history of the Greek system."
4,more of the same... and that's good!,"This is a solid release. Nice song structures, nice guest spots, nice everything. Curve (still) sound like Curve. Hurrah! (...?)"
5,You won't be disappointed--at all!,"I received ""Gift"" as a gift (no pun intended) for Christmas and let me tell you, it's an amazing album! I've been listening to it a lot lately and have fallen in love with it all over again. Toni Halliday's vocals are superb, seductive, and sexy as always and Dean Garcia's musical input inspires me more and more to take up the bass guitar!Every song on the album has something you can grab on to. The tracks that especially leave me wanting more are ""Hung Up"", ""Want More Need Less"", and ""Polaroid"".All of Curve's releases are outstanding in their own way, but ""Gift"" is a good place to start if you're unfamiliar with Toni and Dean's work."
5,Buy yourself a Gift!,"First of all, this cd is awesome! Quite possibly their best cd to date. If you like their previous releases, then you will love this one. Toni's voice has never sounded better. The swirly, wall of noise guitar work of Dean is classic. Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine appears on two tracks, Want More Need Less, and Perish. This cd is everything you would expect from this great British group. Hopefully, they will get the attention and recognition they deserve."
4,fierceness,"This is Curve's greatest album to date. Every song is fantastic. Production is excellent. Lyrics are simple and strong. Toni and Dean have matured, they are like relics for an era that changed the face of Rock-n-Roll. With ""Gift"" I hope they stake claim amongst the immortalized. There is no other band like them. Fierceness, I say!"
4,good for studying tourism,very helpful as a review of the many different ways to study tourism. good examples.
2,no white horse,"i cant believe they would even try to come out with a hit package and not include their biggest international hit. best bet....... look for ""laidest greatest"" or the 2 albums put together on cd called ""Keep Smiling + Hole in the Sky"" ..... good luck on even finding them let alone how much the cost will be. I looked forever. I live in the usa. Finally I ordered both disc from Russia of all places, but the price was ok. The music is great!"
4,Good collection but not complete.,"This compilation features the greatest hit of Laid Back, Sunshine Reggae and White Horse. The rest are quite good but only minor hits. Too bad this collection does not include one of Laid Back's best song ""It's a shame"" from the 1987 album ""See you in the lobby"" which is extremely hard to find on CD these days. This would have been a 5 star disc if it includes ""It's a Shame"". But for you who are not familiar with Laid Back this compilation should be enough to sample. Recommended."
5,The number one joystick for the serious gamer!,I use this stick for several flight simulators and have found it to be head and shoulders above anything Microsoft has put out ... and it works with several versions of MS.
2,Doesn't deliver,"I had high expectations for this book, but I don't really think I got what I paid for. I realize that the book is not a programmers reference book (and indeed I am not a programmer) but I really expected it to explain in more detail what the EDI standard(s) are all about. Instead of doing that, it runs through several sections of implimentation scenarios and legal issues ... all covered on an very basic and generic level, such as ""remember to train the operators"", ""the server most be have enough processing power"" and ""make sure that the managers understand the benefits of the system"". While all of this advice makes sense, it applies to virtually any system aquisation and implimentation. The word ""XML"" is not mentioned once in the entire book - so draw your own conclusions."
3,good overview of EDI,This book gives a good overview of EDI. The main standards are explained quiete well and we can then get a good understanding of the EDI world.At some points this book would need to get updated but it is fine as a first reading.
3,Common Knowledge,"Jilovec says it is difficult to implement EDI. As it turns out, the difficulty is not with EDI per se. EDI is for exchanging business documents (orders, invoices, etc.) between companies. The challenge is to get the companies to agree on the format of the material they will exchange, and to organize the development process. Anyone who has experience programming this kind of application in any language will be familiar with most of what this book tells you. This book is overpriced for what it teaches. The good news is that I now understand what EDI is about."
4,My first review,"Here we have the Vindictives covering the Ramonessecond albumin it's entirety, and then some. This is one of the better Ramones tribute albums. The band can really rock. What I really like is that they changed the arrangements of the songs, so that they aren't note for note copies of the original versions. For instance, ""Pinhead"" features dialogue samples from the filmFreaks, which was the movie that inspired the song in the first place. And ""Commando"" starts off as a military march. Recommended for Ramones fans and fans of punk rock in general."
4,Another great tribute!,"One of the best Ramones tribute albums you will find. When ""Leave Home"" first came out, I had to have it. And it has remained one of the favorite all time Ramones albums of all time. This remake just made it that much sweeter to me. It is done in the same way the original was, and means FAST. That was one of the words used back when the Ramones first came out, along with loud and a few other words I will not be able to use here. But, if you are like me and totally enjoyed the Ramones version, then you will love this one as well. All the feel, speed and decible level needed for a real Ramones fan to sink thier teeth into. Take my word for it, do yourself a favor and pick this one up as your own tribute to the greatest band ever. You don't want to be a Pinhead forever do you?"
4,A Hidden Treasure,"I struggled between 4 and 5 stars because I loved this book from my childhood and those feelings sort of shaped my opinion when I reread it as an adult.Glory is a little girl growing up in the mountains in a time when superstition was rampant and neighbors helped neighbors. When Glory finds a fluffy white cat and brings her home, she is not met with approval--and not just because she named the cat after the local ghost, Miss Nancy Rose.This book is full of the flavor and color of the time period and place, which even as a child I remember loving (even when I didn't fully understand it). It's truly a lost treasure, and I'm happy to have it back in my collection."
5,Mom loves it,"We purchased this gift for Mom and she loves it. It arrived quickly, was relatively easy to install and she is now enjoying the birds - even the cardinals somewhat perch - generally being ground feeders. We highly recommend this product. Love the description - good for arthritic hands - very true!"
3,pricey but keeps squirrels at bay...,"the 3 piece pole could be sturdier. the seed tray lip is quite slippery and first time birds slide off when trying to land. the top rain guard should be wider to keep snow/rain out of tray. it does keep the squirrels out, that's why i bought it. cleans up easily."
4,How could anyone play this glorious music poorly???,"Having only heard the Naxos version before (same stunning soprano and similar Polish forces) and having been blown away by it, this is no disappointment. The Naxos though is very special and has the ""Three Pieces in the Olden Style"" filler for good measure.There aren't many pieces of music that so aptly manifest in music ""...universal suffering, stoically borne..."" (quote from the CD booklet). For those who enjoy this music, there is so much more of Gorecki to enjoy - sample the ""Miserere"" etc on Elektra Nonesuch; Concerto for Harpsichord (off it's face music!),""Good Night"" etc with Dawn Upshaw et al on the same label.Enjoy!"
5,Wonderful Read,"She travels back in time to find she's now Agatha; a prim, proper woman living as a recluse in the house he built for her when she left after the birth of the twins. His ""wife"" is now so much nicer, with a loving nature, that he wonders if they could rebuild their marriage. His interfering mother and ex-mistress don't want to see that happen. A delightful, quick read with wonderful characters."
5,a flash history lesson,"I had heard of the 'charge of the light brigade' and knew it had something to do with soldiers on horses and a battle a long time ago and thats about it. This book follows Colonel flashman and his supposed memoirs and of course per chance he is at the 'charge of the light brigade' but not because he wants to be. It's a precise history lesson wrapped around the deeds and escapades of Flashman, and when you have read it you will know all about the Crimean war and the situation with Russia in that conflict and their attempts to progress in that period of time. You also learn about things at a street level in Russia and on the fields in the war at that time which must have been terrible. An excellent book, and not just for the hiliarous actions of Flashy - but to learn about times and conflicts long ago that still have some bearing on today."
4,Another very fine Flashman novel.,"Ha! A terrific book! For those who have read other Flashman books, nothing needs to be said beyond ""Flashy strikes again!"". For the rest, you're missing something. Where else (in your reading)can you have a rip-roaring good time, yet be encouraged to learn more about the (ludicrous) Crimean War and the Russian expansion into Central Asia? And how Flashman survives the charge of the Light Brigade..."
5,Anexcellent enthralling stroy,"The flashman papers are a delight to discover and once found, You have to return. Simply because you want to see what the old scoundrel is going to do next and with whom. A great series to collect but be prepared to lose sleep so that you can finish them all."
5,"Flashman, the series","ROFL, LMAO funny fiction in a semi-plausible historical settings. Defames many of the figures you yawned over in World History back in 9th grade. Flash is a real man's man. Read the books, preferably in order."
5,Read this book!,"The great Flashman series is probably the funniest nad most entertaining series of history books ever written. Reading it is a brilliant history lesson, far better than any avaliable in a textbook. For all ages!"
4,Well-drawn Brew!,"The Brew is active in Austin, Texas, often performing at Sullivan's Ringside and Iron Cactus. This album is a collection of some of their light jazz hits. In the club scene, however, their sound is distinctively salsa in the tradition of Carlos Santana, so be looking for future releases by this memorable, eclectic band."
1,Not what we might expect,"I like Pico Iyer enough to say I have read all his books. This is by far the worst. I struggled to finish it. Filled with book reviews and essays on things like the use of commas it is not what I have come to expect from him. The first 50 pages were ok, but after that it went down hill. I was in Hokkaido Japan over Xmas with this book, hoping to read it near the fire at night. I resorted to my only alternative -- reading Japanese Manga in Japanese (which I can barely read) rather than face this book again. Buy another selection by Pico, not this one."
2,Not wanted on voyage,"Pico Iyer gets equable mixed up with equitable at the bottom of page 95, but that's the least of his sins. Does any journalistic scrap now count as an essay? Nothing binds together the bits of this impressively chunky but sublimely unnecessary collection, one third in-flight-magazine-style travel writing, nearly two fifths dreary book reviews (books are allowed to be dull, I feel, critics never) and the remainder, well, a bunch of oddments with which to while away an idle hour. In Praise of the Humble Comma? Meh. An unusual name, an Indian-Anglo-American background and a Japanese wife get you a long way in this game. Stow in the hold"
2,The disappearing MP3 player,I loved this product for 4 months (it does have lots of gadgets that I love) and then.....for no reason at all my computer no longer recognizes it! Rhapsody doesn't recognize it....It's turned into a ghost although I can see it!I have a 5gb but a lot of the H10's are having the same problem. I can play all of the songs that I owned myself but everything through the subscription service has run out and can't be reinstalled. I've done a little research about the disappearing MP3 player and it appears to be a problem that is affecting a lot of the H10's and 1 other model I can't remember right now and iRiver can't figure it out; although I've been told they are trying desperately to find the bug....So buy with caution....
3,Worked great but then DONE !!,I really like everything about this mp3 player but mine quit working after like a week . I had to send it back and Im waiting for refund . I read these had problems but took a chance and now will just go look at ipods . It will rock you if it works for you .
1,piece of s***,"I've had this player for only a few months. It worked fine for only a little while then it lost a system file. I've had to reformat the hard drive 3 times since then, losing all my music files each time. After each reformat, I install new firmware. The player locks up frequently requiring it to be reset and then it loses a system file. I am ready to throw it in the trash."
5,A fresh look at the man and his achievements,"Smiley's lively biographical coverage of Charles Dickens paints a portrait of a convivial, astute and energetic writer who led an action-packed life as a prolific writer and family man. Blending with this highly recommended portrait of the man is a survey of his major works and narrative style, providing a fresh look at the man and his achievements."
2,"friends, relatives. no mention of how they are connected","for somebody who just rolled out from under the stone, i dont see how all these people that she mentions in the book, are connected to mr, dickens. i didnt live in england in the nineteenth century. i dont know who he is. and lucky, or maybe unlucky for me, the author doesnt help me finding out who are all the other people in his life. names are listed, but not their relation to him.here is a quote from the first paragraph. dickens, born on february 7, 1812, was only twenty-one, but because....it took me a few minutes before i decided to ignore it, and not to try to understand this sentence. maybe i am dum, i dont know?i would look for another biography if i was looking today."
4,The crowned prince's secret...,"This is definitely the most unrealistic book in the Sweet Valley Twins series. In this story, a new foreign exchange student comes to Sweet Valley from the tiny country of Santa Dora. Elizabeth befriends Arthur, the new boy, and learns of his secret: that he is the crowned prince of Santa Dora. Elizabeth promises not to tell, but the secret somehow gets out (thanks to Jessica). Can their friendship survive? Well, I thought it was pretty fun to read, as are all the Sweet Valley Twins books. The plot is pretty exciting, but it's just not too realistic. What are the chances of a prince coming to your school? Pretty slim. But if ou use your imagination, it's a fun read."
5,Finding the Heart in Healthcare,"This book takes ""Creating Covenants"" to an entirely new level--adding both a global perspective and a call-to-action to the higher spirit in us all. Dr. Crooks again takes the complexities, rationalizations and schemes that exist to ration health care---and asks the reader to put them to a simple test. The test requires only that we ask whether or not the resources being applied are matched by the responsibilities being taken by the patient, the family/caregiver, the provider and the payer. This stunningly simple approach offers something positive for both the liberal and the libertarian---a new way to think about the funding and the delivery of healthcare. Dr. Crooks adds to this the compassion and ""soul"" for which she is so well-known to motivate us all to be better consumers or providers or payers of healthcare. The new ideas and global viewpoint make this a very worthy successor to ""Creating Covenants""."
4,"Great item, holds everything!","I just wanted to write-in and say that I looked everywhere, and I mean everywhere for a leather cell phone case for my T-Mobile G1 with the Seidio 2600 mAh extended battery. The battery extends the life of the phone but makes it somewhat thick. I also was at the point where I got tired of having to bring my wallet and hang my cellphone on a belt loop everywhere I go. Now it's all packaged into one wallet! The cell phone fits, as does everything else! OK, you also need to be somewhat secure in who you are since I've had it called 'my purse' or 'my murse' by others. If you want to make it a bit more masculine I put one of those big metal D clasps on the end of it (the kind climbers use) to carry it around by. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the zippers used are somewhat flimsy and I can see them jamming and breaking probably within a year's time; but for the price you just can't beat this 'extended wallet!'"
2,For Very Light Need Only,"The A920 All In One Printer from Dell is for light use only. Mine misfeeds paper regularly, so you must be prepared to manually adjust it. That's fine for printing 3 pages but time consuming for 20 pages. The color quality is marginally acceptable: soon after loading a new cartridge the color will have striped effects and no amount of coaxing with the recommended methods has an effect. The speed is slow. If you abandon printing with it for a while you will find that the nozzles of the not-inexpensive ink cartridges have dried irredeemably, requiring replacement of both the black and the color toner although both cartridge reports may read as nearly full. Passable for regular very light use, not suitable for production use."
2,You get what you pay for,"Dell is still selling this printer? Amazing. I got one of these three years ago for $20 as a special offer with a Dell laptop that I purchased. Twenty bucks is about what it's worth. It consistently misfeeds paper, so your prints come out crooked half the time or the printer just jams. The print quality is barely adequate in either color or black and white. It's OK to have around as a scanner and copier, provided you don't need top quality. But buy something else if you're going to be doing any real printing. This can be a fun toy to play around with but it's not a real printer."
3,Edited,"There should be a law that record companies must inform you on their CD's that some of these songs have been edited. This collection would be 5 stars if not for the fact that some of these classic tunes have been shortened so they could get all of these songs on 2 disks. ""American Pie"" is only 4:07 minutes. The original that was released is just over 8:00 minutes. It is one of the all time classics and should never be tampered with. I am not sure how many other songs have been edited. However if you don't mind that and want a bunch of great tunes then go for it. I for one only want complete unedited classic music. Be careful when you buy these various artist CD's if they are not from a well known company like Time Life. Sometimes they don't even have the original artist. Imagine buying one of these CD's and finding ""Jumpin Jack Flash"" performed by ""The Monkeys""? Or even by a completely unknown act. Anyway there should be a law for warning labels."
2,Outdated theories posed as facts,"If you are looking for a book that will explain the uses, and the effects of certain sports supplements and or drugs this is not the book. The book uses scare tactics from out-dated and disproven information. If you are an athlete or have a child that is an athlete and you want up-to-date information on products then you are better off buying a book or a magazine that is written by, doctors that are also athletes. Save your money and buy a book that uses studies that were done after 1999 unlike the 5 year studies used in Pumped."
2,not that great,"Sadly, VNV Naton is now better at making Depeche Mode albums than Depeche Mode is. If you liked Exciter, this is more of the same. It's a little better than that album, but not enough to make it anywhere near essential.You can say this review wasn't helpful if you like, but I own every DM album and have seen them live 8 times, so it's not like I wasn't hoping for a great, or even good, album.There's a couple decent tunes, but if you made a CD of great DM songs, nothing from this album would be on it."
3,Another Solid Effort,"DM rarely disappoints, with the surreal voice of its leader singer and the complex riffs. It kind of falls down in the middle, but has some rousing songs to pick it up into a positive listening experience."
4,Another good DM effort,"I happen to like the Exciter album. But Playing the Angel is better. More my style, and more of what I like about Depeche Mode. Some here have said that Precious is the best song on this record and I'd have to disagree. One of the best? Yes. But tracks like a pain that I'm used to, suffer well, the sinner in me, and nothings impossible are songs that have to be considered for that honor. Some good, dark, moody, electronic music. Check it out if your into that kind of thing!"
4,A true Depeche Mode fan could only appreciate...,"So, when did it become against the law to change? If a band or solo artist tries anything outside of what was once commercially acceptable, people hate. But if they re-run the same beat over and over again, people hate.As a DM fan for over 15 years, I can say that yes, originally, I wasn't feeling this CD. I had high expectations and was hoping for yet another Violator or possibly Music for the Masses, but Playing the Angel is great on its own merits.I think the people who are writing negative reviews are those that were only into DM based on their singles, on not on their albums as a whole.Playing the Angel is more along the lines of Songs of Faith and Devotion for me with the same dark undertones and creative lyrics.For those true DM fans out there... buy this CD. You'll enjoy it's sound and by the way, Dave Gahan's voice has never sounded better."
2,Incomplete... DM should do it better ...,"Ihave been waiting for a new DM production. When I heard Precious, I think it was a return to paths a la Violator, but is most a mix from Song of Faith and Devotion with no guitars and a minimalistic approach without and objetive. The disc is indeed the darkest production, but not the better You have to listen the songs many times before you start to like them. The disc is incomplete and the production is full of mediocrity, I concur with the ones that miss Alan Wilder.Definitely DM should do it better if they want to stay fresh, actually they are not what they used to, and I doubt they would be again what they were in Music for the Masses, or Violator (the best albums). Playing the Angel lacks of the power of those productions both in the production and in tempo. DM missed the chance to recover their site as an influential and innovative band they once were."
1,Not as good as Violator and any of the old Depeche Mode albums...,"Please listen to this new album very carefully. Playing the Angel is not as good as Violator and any of the old Depeche Mode albums. The new hit song, ""Precious,"" does not seem to end very well. The band should have repeated the chorus one more time at the end. It ruined my listening experience."
1,buy the precious single instead,"There is just one good track on this album, and it is Precious, which is a new depeche mode classic in the vein of Enjoy the Silence. But even this standout is nearly sunk by an absurd lyric about silver wings. The Depeche Mode rhyming scheme, once so charming, has kind of worn out its welcome.Most of these songs are tuneless. The striving gospel numbers seem forced. The lyrics are laughable pop-psychobabble. The overfiltered and dirtied vocals don't suit the songs half of the time. Not nearly as good as Exciter, which had several good tracks."
2,enough of the 80's synthesizer!,"I love depeche mode and I really think they struck a nerve and found their souls in Songs of Faith & Devotion and Ultra.Think back for a minute and realize what made those 2 albums so powerful. For one, the band was bouncing back from depression and drug use. Second, they used (for the most part) natural instruments. When those drums (from a real drum set) came crashing down, you felt it right through your spine. The synthesizer just doesn't provide that reality...cause it is what it is....synthesized music...yuk.Sorry, but I'm sooo over their 80's sound. Time to break new ground guys.Dissapointed fan."
2,Disguising inadequacy,"Besides for a few very pleasant hints to former greatness, a seeping, creepy-old-hipster smell infests chilled electro brooding past expiration date."
3,Too Inconsistent,The first five songs are excellent but the quality drops off after that. It's a shame because I feel Precious is one of the best singles they've ever recorded. That's saying a lot for a band this talented and successful.
4,"A more modern, new era Depeche Mode..","This is a good album. A good Depeche Mode album at that. I like the direction the band took with this album. It almost has a industrial feel to it. While it is darker than some of their older stuff, I wouldn't call it darker than say, Ultra. Anyways, I've enjoyed this album alot, even though I'm not what you would call a hardcore or devoted DM fan.The album does have a remarkabe flow too it, from begining too end. There are times when it feels like I'm listening to NIN, I know others feel the same way. But thats not a bad thing, and I think this is a great ""return"" album for the band. There isn't a weak spot in the whole album and some spots sound....almost ""magical"" for lack of a better word. My two personal favorite tracks are ""Precious,"" and ""Damaged People."" Precious is easily one of DM greatest songs. Other great tracks are A Pain That I'm Used To, John The Revelator, & Lillian.Well done Depeche Mode."
5,Great Songs!,"Songwriting, songwriting, songwriting. That's what sums up Depeche Mode for me. Beyond that, it's great that they choose to experiment with different sounds in the context of both electronics and acoustic instruments."
3,i miss Alan's touch more and more...,"I am sorry to disappoint any of you. I have been a huge Depeche Mode fan for about twenty years. The last album that gave me the 'Mode' shot I became addicted to was Sofad. Ultra was OK and some of its songs at least sounded more or less like Depeche Mode. Exciter and Playing the Angel do not sound 'Depeche Mode' at all and did not give me the 'Mode' shot.After Alan's departure DM sounds like the producer who produces their albums makes them sound.I really miss the Depeche Mode sound that Alan created and re-invented every album: a complex, rythmic, layered and most of all very unique wall of sound that supported Martin's excellent song writer capabilities.Playing the angel is not bad, but it leaves me untouched."
2,Not their best,I recently bought this album and thought it totally strange and depressing except for 2 songs Precious and Nothings impossible which stand out .Where is the old depeche mode lets have a few upbeat dance numbers thrown in the mix.
1,AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I've been a fan of Depeche Mode since they first came on the scene, and the last album of their that I really, truely enjoyed was ""Songs of Faith & Devotion"". This album is boring, flat and just plain depressing. I'd give it zero stars if I could."
2,Why did this take four years to come up with?,"To say that 'playing the angel' is simplistic and pedantic would be much the same as stating that drawing a crooked line on a sheet of paper somehow requires a ruler.It's all down to the producer(s), which are all Depeche Mode have left. The kindly gentlmen from various production houses who want to add something 'impressive' and 'original' to their resumes. It's no accident that Flood will not have anything to do with them.I will state it, bluntly, this band should have stopped when Alan Wilder left. There is no other way to view it; ignore all the talk of analogue equipment being brought back in for the making of this album.Depeche Mode have obviously been listening to bands who sound like them, there is no other explanation for such a banal and derivative clunker like 'playing the angel' (or perhaps it should have been titled 'playing the angle' as it is quite calculated).If this one isn't the end god help us."
2,Ordinary,"Let's say up front that I'm not a Depeche Mode ""fan"".That said, I loved Violator. I'd recommend listening to that again rather than spending time on this album. At track 2 things are looking good...by track 5 they're still OK... by track 10 I'm just waiting for it to end."
3,I'm not impressed,"I know what I'm talking about here, besides this album I have 12 more depeche mode albums, I'm a long time fan of their music but this albums is not what I expected.Precious is a great song but besides umhh Im not sure nothing new, nothing fresh. I'ts a really dark recording very appealing but to be honest give me violator, songs of faith and devotion, even ultra anytime over playing the angel."
4,Surprisingly good!,"Exciter was a pretty 2.5 star album, but this one blows the doors off of that. As others have mentioned, I don't think it's better than Violator by any means (their best, IMO), but this CD is great. Depeche Mode has a knack for pulling off an aesthetic, and this CD has a good grasp of adding little touches that make even the least brilliant song shine a little brighter. If you are a fan of the 80's DM, I recommend at least giving it a listen."
4,Just buy it,"Let's be honest. DM is like pizza - it's even good cold and its hard to find a bad piece. This is a good album, plain and simple. No deep analysis required and much better than most of the garbage that plays on MTV or the radio or XMRADIO or anything that mimics the mundane top 40 garbage that sounds as if it was written in 3 minutes. (Ok, MTV doesn't play videos anymore).Anyway, I enjoy listening to this to and from work. It has a great beat and you can dance to it.Enough with the silliness. Enjoy the lack of silence and just buy it. DM fans will not be disappointed."
2,This is not their darkest album,"and to call it that is simply a huge overstatement. The darkest album by Depeche Mode BY FAR is Black Celebration, a musical tour de force by a group that knew what they were doing. This album is just so so. Neither great, neither good, neither unlistenable. It' just kind of ""there"". it has the big emotional hit that sounds like Depeche Mode still has it (Precious), but that's it. I loved almost everything DM did up to their so so album Ultra. In retrospect, I even liked that album more than I thought I did. But Exciter (just awful) and this thing....just not doing it for me. I want DM to be great again. They deserve it. They have been around for THIRTY YEARS (which shows how long I've been a fan). And I want to like the new album Sounds of the Universe and give it a try, but from what I can tell by the singles and the samples, I might be dissapointed. I think I'll go into my time capsule now, close the door, and listen to Violater, Music for the Masses, and 101."
2,not so great music,"This music bits I don't know what I did with it, I don't think anybody is stupid like me. ."
4,Good effort,"I got this as a Christmas present, it was actually the DVD/CD package. Not as enjoyable to me as Violator and Music For the Masses, but artists evolve and we can't live in the past can we? I enjoy most of the album, particularly Suffer Well (an excellent tune by Gahan), Precious, and A Pain that I'm Used to. Sometimes the album drags, but it is a welcome shift from Exciter, probably in my opinion, the worst DM album ever. I tried and tried to like it, just didn't work.If you enjoy DM, you need to give this one a try."
5,Back on track,"Finally Depeche is back on track. As other reviewers said, Playing The Angel recalls the ""Songs Of Faith And Devotion"" era with the upbeat tracks (""John The Revelator"", ""A Pain That I'm Used To""), and the ""Ultra"" era with the slower tracks (""I Want It All"", ""Damaged People""). Every single track stands out and as a zealot fan I'm confident to say that without a doubt this album is one of the best they have ever made. Just check it out and you will know why I'm claiming this. I'll bet you'll be positively surprised."
1,Disappointing,"This album is their worse yet. I love DM and really think that they are trying too hard to reinvent themselves and their music and are going the wrong route. Let's face it, an old 80's band like DM is a love it or hate it band and will NOT attract new fans. All they can do is maintain the loyal ones like myself. I thought Exciter wasn't all that great, but it was ok..if..you are a loyal fan. But this new album is simply boring and awful with the exception of 2-3 songs. Still I bought it and am going to their concert as a true fan. I think that this maybe their very last DM album. Atleast if they make a new album, make it like the old electronic DM classics we all know and love."
4,A great album!,"I have to say, this album is very hit and miss, but when it connects it can be considered one of Depeche Mode's best. I was extremely happy to hear how good this album was, especially the tracks ""Suffer Well"" and ""John the Revelator"", given how poorly I thought the album Exicter was. This would be my fourth favorite album after Songs of Faith and Devotion, Violator, and Ultra (in that order). Worth the price of purchase!"
4,Better than Exciter! But its no Violator,"I thought the new CD is actually pretty good. i keep hearing many comparing it to violator but its not nearly as fast paced as that CD was. I think it's closer to Ultra myself but MUCH better than Exciter. The lyrics are ""ok"" on the CD not as good as there pre violator stuff. As far as the music is concerned it is very good the sounds are just awesome."
3,Where's Alan Wilder?,"I'm a big DM fan, but DM has never been the same since Alan Wilder's departure. The songs are well written, and there is no denying Martin Gore's song writing skills. However, the songs on this album seem to be misguided in production. It actually sounds like Gore's ""Counterfeit 2"" album except with Gahan on vocals. The songs never reached their full potential. Songs such as ""The Sinner in Me"" and ""The Pain I am used to"" could have been great(a la ""Never let me Down Again"" or ""Personal Jesus""). But the songs just never got there. Dont get me wrong, this is a good album, and will definitely grow on you...but I know DM can do better.Couple of Solutions for DM:1) Swallow your pride and get Alan Wilder to produce the songs.2) Do an acoustic album to place the focus on the song writing rather than the annoying bleeps and distorted synth sounds."
4,Best since Violater,"This is a solid and driven album by the great DM. This is their best album since Violater (my favorite). It doesn't beat Violater but it still comes in as a strong second.The beginning of the album hits you over the head with some dark, heavy, industrial sounding techno beats. However, I feel that the end of the album gets too muddy.That being said I would still recommend you buy it. Esp., if you're a DM fan.I hope they tour with this baby because they are soooo good live."
1,It isn't just brooding - it's boring,"Listen, I'm a big Depeche Mode fan and I don't know what these people praising this album are talking about. Every song is either slow or very slow, filled with lots of weird synth noises and distortion. There's so much distortion in the first track I thought that I bought a defective CD. These guys are quite capable of writing great songs and there isn't any here. But hey, if you like dreary songs that lack melody with lots of weird noises in them, then by all means, who'll love this."
4,respectable but a bit over-hyped too,"At least half of the Cd is worth listening to. The music is not that different from what they've been doing in the past. But that doesn't mean its bad either. ""Precious"" is catchy and current-sounding enough to attract teens to listen to it (take that as a compliment to the band I guess?)."
2,Semi Precious,"Depeche Mode has always been my favorite band. However, I have noticed a gradual decline in song quality since Exciter. Exciter had some really good tracks, but it had some notably bad tracks such as the biblically slow ""Breathe"" and ""Comatose"". If you enjoyed the slow and uninspiring ""Breathe"" along with some of the slower selections from Martin's 2004 ""Counterfeit2"" lp, then you should buy this release.Precious is the strongest track this time out, but the rest pale in comparison. It feels as though Martin is ""hanging by a rope of mediocrity"". I advise bringing back either Tim Simenon or Alan Wilder. Andrew Fletcher was right when he said that this was their best work since ""Speak & Spell""."
3,Pluses; Minuses,"The pluses on the new Depeche Mode are obvious: more energy (not to be confused with speed), solid songs, Dave Gahan's continuous improvement as a lead singer. There are at least four ace DM tracks here: Suffer Well, The Sinner in Me, Precious, Lilian. The minuses are that each of these tracks have antecedents in their previous work, and the new stuff isn't so much an improvement as a restatement. So once you acclimate yourself to the new tunes, the question becomes: will you be Playing the Angel, or would you rather here Black Celebration or Violator?"
2,Comparable To Exciter and Just as Boring,"Once again, DM runs with a producer who's sound lends dullness rather than excitement. More pointless ""bleeps"" & ""squelches"" that do not further the meoldy and actually prevent the song from becoming a true DM classic. ""Precious"" being the only stand-out track and a true return to what DM is, dark & deep lyrical content, strong vocals, and a good beat to match. ""Suffer Well"" coming in a strong second and really should have been a strong contender, it simply cannot overcome shoddy production. Skip this album & buy anything from ""Ultra"" and earlier."
2,Not as good as advertised. Nowhere near Violator.,"....or Music For the Masses....or Black celebration....Is it a bad album? No. Not at all. It is just an example of an older band making music that doesn't really hit the mark. It's normal to make comparisons to older classic albums, but those are often heights that just can't be reached again.The songs on Playing The Angel are filled to the brim with pretentious vocals. Gahan still wallows in his own misery, which is pretty typical. The music doesn't really catch your ear though. It's slow and even jarring at times. Basically, it's boring. If you're a huge DM fan, you'll want it. Just don't get your hopes up too much."
4,Best Since Violator,"I know it is cliche to say that this is the best since Violator, but it is true. Songs of Faith & Devotion and Ultra were great albums but had a few weak moments that tended to make the entire album drag a little (and Exciter was anything but exciting). Precious, John the Revelator, A Pain That I'm Used To, and Lilian are some of their strongest (and most instantly likeable) songs of their career. The other songs are mostly strong as well but are more of the typical Depeche Mode songs that take some time to fully appreciate and love.I almost didn't buy this album as I was losing hope that they could live up to their 80's and early 90's output, but the strong reviews from the music press piqued my interest. I am so glad I gave this a chance as it is one of the best of the year.Edit: Songs of Faith and Devotion is the better album."
4,It's Been a Long 12.5 Years,"Finally, a Depeche Mode album I want to listen to repeatedly. That hasn't happend since Song of Faith and Devotion!"
3,"Been There, Done That","Following the after-hours ambience of the ironically-titled Exciter, Depeche Mode return with a distorted, industrial sound, recalling earlier classics like The Dead of Night, Barrel of a Gun, and I Feel You. Though the relaxed, down-tempo Exciter was a progression into new territory, Playing the Angel is a conscious retreat. This time Dave Gahan has managed to do what Alan Wilder never could, get more than 2 of his songs on a DM release, and--like Wilder's infrequent contributions--his material deserves to be heard. I liked DM better before they started making purely serious albums in the mid nineties. The best tracks here (Precious and Suffer Well) combine their emotional anguish with their innate dance-pop sensibilities, and should remind the band that they don't need to be heavy to be good."
5,This is what Exciter should have been.,"Unlike most DM fans, Ultra happens to be my favourite DM album [but Violator does come in a close second]. I remember listening to Exciter and wondering what had happended [wasn't horrible....but going from what I think is their best album...to their worst...well it makes one wonder].So I was ectastic when I heard Playing The Angel. This album is great. Dave Gahan wrote three tracks, all of which are among the album's best. Plus, even though the album is in many ways quinessential DM [dark, layered, strong lyrics, and of course, their quirky use of synths and sound effects], they've made the songs far more uptempo, which makes this album one of their best in my opinion.There are 1 or 2 so-so tracks, but on the whole, these guys have shown that despite being old fogies in the music world, they're coming out with material that only a handful of new artists could touch."
5,Precious gets in your head,"Someone sent me the mp3 of the song Precious. I'm 57, and listening to it with headphones is just amazing! It gets right in your head so you feel like you're a part of the music. I'm going to buy this album and I recommend it highly. If you love Depeche Mode, you will love this."
2,Definitely NOT their best work,"I was hoping for a better album than ULTRA because they are due for one but sadly, this is not that album. I kept waiting for the powerful songs to start and was sadly disappointed. There are a few good songs but not to be considered an album that I would keep. I loved ""Songs of Faith Love and Devotion"" and their older stuff. If this is the way DM is moving I will stop buying their stuff."
3,Should have been an EP!,"If this was an EP, it would have been ONE of their best.This CD starts off extremely strong... very reminiscent of early Depeche Mode. A PAIN THAT I'M USED TO with an extended intro could have easily started off `101' to get the crowd really going. JOHN THE REVELATOR is as close to a revival hymn as your going to get and it is the closest song that comes to rivaling anything pre-Violator. Best song on here period. It dips a little on the third track but THE SINNER AND ME followed by PRECIOUS bring the level back up.It starts to go downhill from there. Maybe I shouldn't say downhill because they are ok songs. They just don't measure up to the first 5 tracks. If this were issued as an EP then it would have been brilliant. As it is, it's no better OR worse than their recent releases. I would advise anyone wanting to buy this to just download the first half from iTunes and pretend the other half doesn't exist.3.5 Stars"
3,Misdirected,"First, I am a fan. Unlike many fans, I think Ultra and Exciter are very good. Not SOFD or Violator great, but definitely good. Exciter has some of DMs very best songs. I think this album is blah. First, as others have mentioned, the Martin songs are atrocious and borderline unbearable - which is a big surprise. Second, while Precious is a great song, nothing else sounds even remotely like it. Its the star, but why they decided to only record one song in this style and the rest in screaming or talking we will never know. Lyrics are generally not up to par.There are a few songs here that will make it into iTunes playlists, but I think even more will be on a very long slow rotation of obscurity. Sadly, this album is still probably better than half the drek being released."
2,DM Should Have Quit After Ultra,"Why all the hype? Are we that desperate for anything decent that we rush to give a mediocre album 5 stars? DM is on a downward spiral, and even they don't know it. This album lacks: inspiration, melody, passion, and good song writing. Don't get me wrong, there are a few pretty good songs, but even these songs would be the worst songs on a good DM album. Bands that need to quit-DM, the Cure, Erasure; bands that are getting better-Echo & the Bunnymen, New Order, Camouflage. As another enlightened reviewer put it: if you are in to dreary sounds, distorted synths, and no melodies, then by all means buy this album."
4,good powerful flow,"This is a good, powerful, athletic flow class. I used this flow when I taught today. The only irritating thing about Mark Blanchard is that he uses the phrase, ""easy goes"" over and over and over."
5,How to Save Some Dollars for Other Tools,"The service couplers it comes with are the 18191A high side & the 18190A low side. I was not sure what service couplers where supplied with the Gauge Set, so I ordered a 18191A high side & a 18190A low side. Spares for when the supplied ones wear out I guess. They want about $133.30 for this set on sale, from local vendors in my area. So I paid the same & got the most likely to wear out parts to boot. Used free super saver shipping 24 July 2008"
2,Not that great,Sturdy belt but I don't like the fact that I have to keep adjusting it because it loosens up during the day. Will go with the Spec Ops belt next.
2,good for regular use but not good enough for carry,"I first got the blackhawk simple bdu belts. After trying them, I had to return them because they were to flimsy and wouldnt work with my holster. The belt looks good and feels good but if you flex so will the belt and I was looking for something thicker and not as flexible"
1,evening sun pattern grows mold,"The evening sun pattern is made out of something called 'earthenware' as compared to Stoneware. These have a greater tendency to absorb and keep water in the area on bottom where they are not glazed, and therefore will have a tendency to grow mold."
3,Gorgeous BUT...,"I fell in love with this pattern, and now it's too late since I bought the entire collection and my kitchen and dining room is decorated to match it. In spite of being very careful with it, it chips easily. So does the Nuance collection, which I bought as everyday ware. It does have lifetime replacement but I'd spend a fortune just shipping back the chipped pieces."
3,Classic Speedboats : The Summit 1945-1962,"Companion book to ""Classic Speedboats 1916-1939"" by the same author. Once again this book was first published in 1997, by a French author, so be advised. James Taylor (hopefully not ""the"" James Taylor) gets the credit for translation to English.Book is an excellent source for period photographs. However, if you know any of the actual history of this subject matter, read the captions with a skeptical eye. The captions written for the more contemporary photographs are a catastrophe! The photographs are exceptional though. Perhaps the caption writer wasn't the author! I certainly hope so!By this book for the photography...just don't read the captions!"
3,Who determines these prices?,Paid way more than the amount indicated on the inside cover jacket- I thought I got a bargain but as it turns out it wasn't such a great deal after all
1,Attachment problem,"I have been unable to use the Yoke because I am unable to attach it to my desk, drawer or anything else. The clamping devices are unrealistic. Either I have to build something to attach the Yoke on or cut apart the clamp units with a hacksaw and then attach it to my desk top with the center drawer opened. That will then put me at a great distance from my screen. In words of a syllable, I'm very disappointed in the product....."
3,Average Quality but Enhances Fun Factor,"I bought the Yoke and pedals to add some realism to my sim pit. The yoke is very sticky and therefore hard to find ""neutral"" to trim a plane. I found the pedals more useful, though both have a real ""toy"" quality to them. I look forward to upgrading in the future to a better built metal set. If you can get them cheap enough, it is worth it for a while."
1,packing and board game,"It was the WORST packing i HAVE EVER seen and the game package is full of this green paint i give it a 1 rating if i could i would give it a zero i would'nt even send it to goodwillFor packing, the seller used rolled up plastic garbage bags and one bag had trash in it. The box and game stink. Something leaked on them with a foul odor."
2,WWE Game,"We bought this game for Christmas for our son. Our whole family is into wrestling so we thought it would be a great family game. It was not!!! It had so many different rules and twists and turns that it made it confusing and frustrating. We spent the whole game looking at the manual! We finally just put it away and decided to watch the intruction video that states ""it's not rocket science"" indicating that it's not hard at all. But my question is ""if that is true and they didnt anticipate it being so hard, then why have a manual with over 10 pages and instruction video ALSO that you have to watch!?!"" We finally tried the next day and then what we didnt get we just made up."
3,"Consider the ""Ruggedized"" Model","Overall, this is a good product, but I do have one suggestion to consider. I have purchased both the ruggedized and non-ruggedized version of this product, and I am satisfied with both. The non-ruggedized model works well, but it requires the user to be more careful/gentle than you have to be with the ruggedized model. The difference between the two is the non-ruggedized version has a extra connection where the cable meets the CF card, and allows you to disconnect the CF card from the cable. The ruggedized version does not have this connection, and is built more sturdy at this point. If you have no reason to disconnect the CF card from the cable, I would suggest buying the ruggedized version."
5,Fantastic mix of songs!,"I lived in England from 1989 to 1992 and listened to The John Peel Show on BBC Radio 1 every night it was aired. This collection of songs truly represents what his show sounded like. I've never heard another DJ like him. Mr. Peal was one of a kind; he had an uncanny ability to discover new artists. Not just your average run-of-the-mill musicians, but great bands. On this CD you'll find a few of them. I only wish it was a ten CD set! I never grow old listening to songs approved by John Peel. RIP Mr. Peel you are missed."
1,Not an interfaith dialogue.,"This is a book which attacks the basic tenets of Christianity. The author is a Muslim but I can't ever find him stating this clearly.This book attempts to refute the Divinity of Jesus, His Crucifixion, and His Resurrection. It paints the early Church fathers as propagandists and deceivers who manufactured the story of Christ and His sacrifice. On the other hand, it ignores the inconsistencies present in Islam, the morally ambiguous questions that arise from the life of Muhammad and his succesors, and otherfacts.If it had included these things, then it might have had some balance. For, to question these things about Islam is similar in offensiveness to the way the author attacks Christianity. But this is not the case. I am glad the author doesn't do such things to his Muslim readers. It is sad that he chose to do so to his Christian readers. I will pray for him."
4,"Covers the information for the old exam, but useful still","Even though the material covers topics for the 640-801 exam, it still can be used to review the core of the CCNA. It covers all the basic information such as subnetting, protocols, router configurations, etc... I used this book as a refresher before studying from the updated Exam Cram. The CD-rom has a Measure Up program with a 50 question practice exam that can be taken in study mode or it can be taken like the actual test. It also contained a 2 question router simulator which I did not find useful at all. I would not recommend studying from it alone because it is outdated."
1,No help for off-line users,"We bought the product for a laptop that goes on exteded trips out of reach of the internet. After discovering that the upgrade had no internal help files, we downgraded to version 2004. Since the databases are not downward conpatable, all of our computers that use Microsoft Money now must use the 2004 version. For us, this purchase was a big mistake."
3,"If you have Money 2004, stay with it",I agree fully with the previous review by Travis. I have been using different versions of MS money from 1997 and this is the worst interface I encountered. I was using MS Money for Small Business - 2004 and was happy with it except for some of the invoice tracking functions. I skipped 2005 version after reading the reviews. Upgrade to 2006 version seemed like a disaster.
1,This is the worst program I ever tried to use.,"I was using Money 2004, My books were up to date when I made one of the worst moves I ever made with software. I bought Money 2005 for Small Business. I have yet to get my books straighten out. I have spent days on the phone with tech support. They sent me the 2006 version. I can't begin to describe what an awful program this is. I don't know if I can ever recover from the mess that has been made. It's six months now and I am still working on it. Buy Quickbooks and forget this."
4,Good value and easy to use,"Just like the major competitor, This product is very easy to use and upgrade. Is a bit slow when first starting up but then the details and reports provided are very helpful. Have not generated an invoice yet but did try a demo one and I think this product is worth the price."
4,Money 2006,Overall good upgrade. Was looking to be able to have sub categories and this upgrade does not allow that.
3,Good but not great,I have found that although the system speaks of great intergration in fact it leaves a lot to be desired. The intergration with Outlook is spotty a best and the help file are anything but. I have emailed the staff and found them helpful but they only work on weekdays and as most small business owner know weekends are when when catch up and are most in need of help. I will probably finish this year with Money but will probably try another program next year.
1,Inventory Management simply doesn't exist,"The only ""similarity the inventory management, is the capability to enter pluses and minuses to a list of SQUs."
2,online problems could not be resolved,Spent 2 1/2 hours online with tech support trying to figure out why it won't show my downloaded transactions on one of my CC accounts - I had been using quicken for the past 10+ years and figured I would try Money - looks like I will be going back.
1,"an inadequate, mislabeled product","I spoke to Microsoft tech people before purchasing this item and was advised that it would do all that I wanted it to do for my company. When I received it, the program did NONE of the functions that I was quie specific about. I was very very disappointed. Additionally, the program is complex, ""too busy"" and the only user guide needs to be downloaded. Totally worthless program...I rate it a -5. I did however voice my dissatisfaction to Amazon and they have stood by their customer for which I am very appreciative of."
4,Definitely representing the soul.,"Kelly is awsome! Soul of a Woman is a fabulous cd. I recommend this album for anyone that has had their heartbroken either by their man or their best friend. It helps you vent your anger, but also makes you realize love and happiness."
5,At lost for words,"The Soul of A Woman CD is simply marvelous. After Listening to it the first time i becames an instant fan. ""Secret Love"", ""Her"", and ""Lord if All"" are my favorites on the CD but i can't help but to listen to the entire CD at least 15 times daily. Kelly's range is not to be messed with. Back up of of Miss KElly Price"
5,This girl can sure SAAANG! on this debut!,"When Friend of Mine came on the airwaves on the radio in 1998, I went, Lord this girl can SAAAANG! It's going straight to Number One! And it sure did! It set the tone for Kelly Price's first album! All throughout, this is wonderful first album she made. Songs like Her, You Complete Me, Lord Of All, and the Friend of Mine remix with Ronald Isley were all superb. Her next two albums are also superb and I still love them too! She's a superb songwriter too and I still love the songs she has contributed or sang on other artists' songs like P Diddy and Mase. She was brillant as a background singer in Mariah Carey's touring band. This is a superb debut in its own right, soulful for a late '90s album in an era of technology and slickly-produced, sample-heavy, hip-hop beats-heavy albums. She recalls a more classic era too."
5,TRUELY INSPIRED !,"I truely enjoyed listening to this CD. The lyrics and music are great.To the ladies out there, this CD is a must have for your collection. SOUL OF A WOMAN is the BOMB!"
5,SHE IS THE BOMB!,"KELLY PRICE HAS TAKEN MY BREATH AWAY WITH THIS NEW CD. WE NEEDED SOMEONE LIKE HER TO COME ALONE, AND PUT MUSIC BACK WERE IT BELONGS."
5,"""OLD SCHOOL TALENT""",Kelley Price album is old school talent meaning an artist that can sing an album you can understand the lyrics and actually relax to. A great add to your music collection.
4,One of the best in a long time.,Kelly Price is truly talented. I can't stop listening to the CD. I think she will be around for a long time.
5,This CD Never Leaves My Stereo,"This CD is SO tight. When I first bought it all I listened to was Friend of Mine (remix), but when I started listening to the entire CD I was hooked. This CD never leaves my stereo."
3,"a good cd, but not the kelly price that i know.","friend of mine, secret love and take me to a dream are the best songs on this album and i think her next album will really show who she is, this is just a sample of ms price's vocal power. please buy it, it's worth the three songs.peace to you"
5,this album is very fulfilling when it comes to affairs of,It's amazing how one persons voice can make your day go extremely different. i can listen to this cd time and time again . to tell the truth it has taught me a couple of lessons because we all at some point in our lifes has been in one or two of those situations. THANKS KELLY
2,It was okay,"Truthfully, the main reason I bought the CD was because of the Friend Of Mine remix. Yes, Kelly Price has talent and I like her as an artist but this album just did not touch me in any special way. It felt as if something vital was missing in her songs. I thought it was going to be a hit, but it isn't. Better luck next time."
2,What a dissapointment!,"After appearing on many Puff Daddy produced remixes and songs Kelly Price finally got her time to shine. On songs like Mase's ""Feel So Good"" she sounded like another Bad Boy related artist (Faith). Also like Faith she had written many songs for other artists as well as most of her own debut. The big difference is Kelly Price's album is a big dissapointment. The only songs that make any impression are the ones where a big name male star assist Kelly. The remix of ""Friend of Mine"" w/ R. Kelly and Mr. Big(Ronald Isley), and ""Secret Love"" which was co-written and produced by 112's Daron Jones. The rest of this album doesn't do much to impress. Maybe she's one of those artists who does her best work only on collaborations. Don't waste your time with this album. Look for some remixes featuring her if you like her voice."
2,This album falls short!,"Let me start out by saying that this was a gift certificate purchase. In other words,this wouldn't have been a cd I would have persued with my own hard earned cash. The remix of ""Friend of Mine"" was the bait I needed to be suckered into this cd. Another R. Kelly produced gem, it clearly is the best track on the cd and is not available as a single (an obvious tactic to get you to buy the cd). In short, this cd has 2 major flaws.(1)Overall, weak production musically.(2)Kelly too often sounds just like Faith Evans. It's a shame, because I think she has a better voice than Faith, it's just not properly used. 5 of the 11 full length tracks list Kelly Price as a producer. Maybe next time she should leave the producing to someone more qualified, and stick to the vocals."
1,SOMETIMES LESS IS MORE !!!,"Kelly has a very big voice but no idea how to use it to maximum advantage. If she'd sung half the notes she sings on this cd it would have been too many - after one listening I'm completely melismatized.People think Mariah Carey defines over-singing. Not any more. Welcome to the new undisputed world champion. Just listen to the sample of ""Your Love"" (track 10) and get a taste of what you will find towards the end of all the other songs.On a good note, ""Friend Of Mine"" is a good tune and a great vocal arrangement, and if Kelly had sung a few notes less on this, I would have kept the cd."
2,very average,"Kelly Price is a alright vocalist even though she sounds alot like Faith&Mary.she is a alright song-writer but the music here is flat.very predictable.only the remix of Friend of mine stands out.with Ronald Soulful"" Isley &R.Kelly.and mainly because it sounds alot like his Down Low song."
3,Not a bad first time effort. Quite soulful !!,"The Albumn has some nice tracks, and she sings very well on them.She's got soul."
4,review,"i think this is a very good cd i like the quality of it very soulful her voice is not as good as it is on her 2nd cd but the songs themselves are good my favorites are ""friend of mine"" (orginal one) ""secret love"" and ""soul of a woman"" i liked how she had daron from 112 on the track ""u complete me"" he complimented her very well in that song as far as his style of singing and i like ""Lord of ALl"" very inspiring and convicting so overall this cd is a good product"
4,Stirring The Spirit,"I am an African-American 32 year old woman. My idea of good music is to go back to old school music where good music stayed--in the old days! UNTIL I heard this CD! Absolutely magnificent! I miss the days of Aretha and Patty sanging not singing, but SANGING! Just like my title says, it stirs your spirit. Even though the topics are worldly, you feel like you are listening to one of the sisters in church. You just don't want to go home. Kelly girl, keep up the good work. Don't let me down."
1,this book stinks,"This book provided NO insight after the death of my youngest son to my other children. I purchased this thinking it would help in some way, but it didn't tell me anything I didn't already know. It is a VERY small book. It should be listed under ""PAMPLETS"". Definitely NOT recommended- not worth the money."
4,The story of a year among animals,"The author details her life in the woods of upstate New York for a year, living with racoons, chipmunks, a dog, several cats, and some goats. In particular, the raising of two baby racoons is detailed, along with many descriptions of the personality of each animal. Zistel is an observant author, and clearly loves animals - which comes through in her warm, affectionate rememberances of the ones she shared her life with. This book was not quite as good as Good Companions by Zistel (which features some of the same animals), but certainly it's worthwhile if you're an animal lover looking for an interesting read. However, this is a true story, not a feel good one, so beware that some of the animals meet tragic ends - that said, however, there is no graphic violence to be concerned about. The story of Gretel, an orphaned raccoon who spent her entire life with the author, is particularly enjoyable."
5,Communication that creates connection,"Would you count to three if your best friend didn't do what you asked? Ask the parent of any teenager if counting at them still works. In this powerful and practical little book, that every parent has time to read, Inbal Kashtan teaches us ""another way"" by brilliantly applying the practice of Nonviolent Communication to the everyday parenting struggles that tempt us to resort to coercion.I recommend Parenting From Your Heart to all parents who are striving to move from parenting through coercion and fear to parenting through love and connection."
5,The Last Postonove,"As always the Favela Chic Postonove collection brings us quality music with great artists that, in my case, it was the first time I've heard them.This compilation is really nice to hear with a really good introduction, one of my favourites, and it really flows from them on, with great songs for all the tastes, one of them Balanca Pema, is really a gem and really hard to find.I advice you to purchase this album, it will open many doors you didn't knew they existed in brazilian music.Peace"
4,Very neat and not gaudy,"I have this same charm with a clear glass/crystal underneath. I really like it and have gotten many compliments when I wear it. Most everyone wants to know what it is, since its fairly intricate. The only downside I have to it would be that when the silver spins the crystal underneath, it collects stuff between the two and is sometimes difficult to clean out. Other than that I really like it."
1,The new control configurations kill the game,"Madden 2005 was a 10/10 star game, but even thou it has better graphics, updated rosters, super star mode, but the problem is that i can't make the control configurations the way it was in Madden 2005, because if i change one letter than it will change the other one. And also Madden 06 is very slow, not because of the hardware but because of the way it's done. It also has problems on Windows 64-bit acording to every user that has this game on Win64.I really don't recomend buying this game to others, better spend your money on other game."
1,Same Issues-Cannot Play,"I am having the same issues as the below reviews. I would love to be able to rate this game, however I cannot because I have not yet been able to play. It locks up on the initial load screen, and as below the only way to remedy is to reboot. I've given up on a solution until an update from EA is available.P.S.-I have gotten the game to work, though not correctly. By renaming the ""music"" folder to ""music1"" the game will play, but without the in-game music!"
2,Superstar mode... big deal!,"After I purchased the game and loaded it on my computer I became very upset and disappointed. Aside from a few gameplay additions, nothing had changed with the game, and its roster management. The superstar thing is a waste of time for me as well as it seems as though Madden is catering to the growing TO problem. You know... Me Me Me... I I I... I wanted the game to be more diverse and user friendly on the roster screens. And what happened to the draftees coming from your NCAA game into the Madden game. This was a feature I enjoyed. I was completely disappointed with the game and if you are like me, use Madden 2005 and find the updated rosters."
5,Football...,"Bought as a gift for my 20 year old son. He had Madden 03. I was looking for 11 but could not find it for the lap top. We do not have any of those ""other"" game machines. I could not pass up the price and he is enjoying the up-grade!"
1,Major disappointment,I bought this game and it won't even work on my machine. It freezes up during the loading screen. EA has no technical support for help.My System Specs:MSI 845PE (1.8GHz P4)RAM - 1GBAsus Radeon 9800 Pro (256 MB)Liteon 52x32x52x CDLiteon 16x DVD
1,This is the worst football game ever made.,"See title. Rosters suck, gameplay sucks, music sucks IF I HEAR BAT COUNTRY ONE MORE EFFING TIME I SWEAR TO GOD THAT SONG SUCKS."
1,Support is even worse this year,"The controls have been completely remapped on gamepads, and unlike the console versions, you cannot set them back to the way they've been for the last decade. It is going on week 6 of the NFL season, and a roster update has yet to be released, and moderators of EA forums have said that Tiburon expects it to be ""a few more weeks"" until any patch or roster update is released. There are starters on teams that didn't even make it to the pre-season. Don't ever expect to return a punt, as it is almost impossible due to buggy AI. If you MUST buy this game, buy a console to play it on. They've had patches and two roster updates so far.Visit the player forums at EA for these issues and more. When EA bought the exclusive rights to the NFL trademarks, and the NFLPA rights last year, they made sure that PC purchasers had nowhere to go but to consoles."
5,"A fantastic, guitar-esque sounding bass string","These will give you that Stanley Clarke funky twang that pierces through the rhythm and into the frontlines of your band. I'd say the best way to describe the sound I get from these is halfway between a bass and a piccolo bass in tone and sound texture. I would not recommend these if you want a lot of low end, for music like hip hop and such, but for anything in the jazz/funk/fusion realm, or if you play a lot of chords and/or tap your bass, these are your strings. Plus, with a price point below 20 bucks, it's worth checking these out."
1,krackle,"Beautiful Harvest faucet. Mine is satin nickel,and the finish is krackled making the faucet unsightly. There were no abrasive cleaners used on my faucet.Very disappointing for the price."
3,"Good quality, but edited","This is Volume 3 of the 10 volume Columbia House series of Woody Woodpecker videos. The video reproduces several episodes of Walter Lantz' TV show from 1976; half of them (from Sh-h-h-h-h-h onward) are missing their original titles. On the other hand, what you do see are in very good quality. Here are the contents of this volume: Chew-Chew Baby (1943), The Sleeping Princess [a Nertsery Rhyme] (1939), The Dizzy Acrobat (1943), The Screwball (1943), Three Lazy Mice [a non-Woody Woodpecker Cartune] (1935), Solid Ivory (1947), Sh-h-h-h-h-h [a non-Woody Woodpecker Cartune directed by Tex Avery] (1955), The Egg Cracker Suite [a Swing Symphony] (1943), Woodpecker in the Rough (1952), Wrestling Wrecks (1953), Pig in a Pickle [a Maw and Paw Cartune] (1954), and Drooler's Delight (1949).Rounding out the volume are a newsreel narrated by Woody and a few segments with Lantz (these were made for the show)."
2,"Is it a ""real"" Trimline...?",...absolutely not! This is the flimsiest phone I've ever owned. I've seen kid's toys that were more substantial than this phone. It works (sorta) - hence the second star.
4,psychward,"This was agreat book, especially if you are a nursing/med student going through your clinical psych rotation..It really put things in prospective....I would recommend it"
3,Not sturdy,Plastic instead of glass constantly pops out of the frame. This frame is not very durable. Manufacturer should be contacted and this defect should be corrected. I just have it propped up against the wall because the plastic keeps falling out. The clips on the back of the frame does not hold it together.
2,Beware,"Hard to use metal clips on the back that I've never seen before in my life! Even after you have the clips set, you pick up the picture by the frame and it all falls apart. Save your money!"
3,get what you pay for,"pretty flimsy but it works. I just put a string on the back tying the top frame to bottom frame because once hung, the top frame was being pulled off the ""glass"" too much"
3,"A Few Brilliant Photographs, But.....","I bought this book because I am in the process of photographing a Colorado photography book myself, and I wanted to see what else was out there. Although there are about 10 very impressive ""close-up"" photos in this book, the rest of the images, especially the landscapes, are fairly marginal. In addition, most of the images were taken from just 4 or 5 locations throughout the state. So it doesn't really give a thorough representation of the variety of scenery in Colorado. I do believe that Art Wolfe is one of the nation's best nature photographers, but I think he puts out a few too many books, thereby sacrificing quality. I would recommend this book over any of John Fielder's books, but David Muench's Colorado II is still the best Colorado photography book I have seen."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"Art Wolfe is a very good photographer, but I have to agree with the person who wrote the first review and say that this book was a bit of a disappointment. Wolfe didn't seem to spend a whole lot of time in Colorado, as most of the photos were taken from only a handful of locations. Also, about half of the photos were taken by Wolfe's assistant. That being said, there are definitely some nice photos, especially if you are looking for photos of Colorado wildlife."
5,Simply the Best and Probably Only Book you Will Ever Need,"I must confess that when I started reading this book I was skeptical, after have I already have read more than 20 books on the subject including all the classics, I see reading another one as simple waste of time, I was wrong this book is simply fantastic it includes all the information you find in more than 20 books on startup's, is very well written by someone that walked the road and not by some academic that only studied it on the library..This is simply the best unique resource of practical advice you can find about starting a corporation, so if you don't want to waste time and money reading a bunch of books about startup's read this, and you are done with 95% that you will ever need to know"
3,Not their best,"I have several CDs where this grooup performs including CDs where they are part of a larger group. I think that the sound quality is a bit off on this one. It is an earlier CD. It is the same lively music with a variety of instruments found on the others. For something better, try ""Walkin'the Dog"" with Steve Gardner, Washboard Chaz, and the Jake Leg Stompers, or possibly ""Wooly Bully Express"" by the Jericho Road Show. Members of the group perform on tour in various iterations. They are worth watching for. You will like the music if you like the old style banjo, washboard, musical saw, guitar, etc."
2,"I love the other sleep sacks, but hate this material","I love the other sleep sacks, you can see my full review of them on their web pages. But this sack has different fabric which I really, really don't like. It isn't actually quilted. It is woven to look like it is. The material is such that it attracts hair and lint to it in the dryer and it catches in the fabric so it takes a bit of light tugging to get it off. It also catches on any hang nails or rough skin. When it is warm I use the cotton sleep sacks and when it is cold I use the fleece (polyester) ones. Great sacks, just annoying fabric with this one."
5,excelente,"Me encanto el producto, de calidad, el color correcto que pedi, llego la talla correcta que pedi, gracias recomendado¡ saludos"
2,"Poor quality, decent fit","This T-shirt is sold as heavyweight, but the fabric is so thin, skin color shows through. The contrasting hems are smaller than the main body, so it looks somewhat bunched up around the arms and neck. Not sure if that will change after washing, because the T-shirt is supposed to be pre-shrunk. Most disappointing is the hemming on the neckband, as it's done with white thread on the back of the neck, and looks cheap and sloppy.Overall, a serviceable underlayer, but not heavy enough or well-made enough to wear on its own."
1,Terrible,This shirt is so cheaply made I could almost see thru it. After 1 wash it began to get holes!
5,The best conditioner I've ever had,"My hair is getting greasy very fast so I've been looking for a conditioner that would moisturize it without overwhelming. My hairdresser recommended me this product and now I always use it. After using it systematically, the texture of my hair improved. It looks healthier, and more shiny.Although the product is not cheap in comparizon to other conditioners, it's really worth it. I used to purchase it in hair salons and at CVS but it was available only in small containers. However, I discovered it gets cheaper if ordered on Amazon in a big bottle."
3,"Decent Quality, but . . .","The quality seems on par for the money spent, but the glasses don't get NEAR dark enough to be usefull in sunlight. Honestly, I can barely tell that there is any tint at all. They'll make decent night/dusk riding glasses, but I was hoping they'd work in the daytime as well. Unfortunatly, they're almost useless for that. I've never tried photochromatic glasses before, though. Maybe they're all like this? I know they aren't supposed to get as dark as regular sunglasses, but I expected at least a noticable change in tint--enough to be useful."
1,Do not waste your money...,Do not waste your money... They do not darken in the sunlight or do they have any working anti-fogging.
2,LATE EDITION,"This booklet is for the Practical Test Standards that is ""Effective August 1, 2002"", NOT the newest edition that is effective June 1, 2012.THIS IS AN OLD EDITION OF THE PRACTICAL TEST STANDARDS. THE IMAGE ABOVE IS WRONG!!! BUYER BEWARE."
4,Not Bad At All,This is an all around solid punk rock album. Its got both melodic punk songs along with more hardcore punk songs. Includes a great cover of the Adolescent's LA Girl. You can hear different punk rock influences in each song ranging from Screeching Weasel to Black Flag.
1,I almost feel like giving this 2 stars for how amazingly bad it was,"Lo Lieh apparently directed this adn I really can't believe that. Teh guy just has to much respect for himself to do that. He is certainly in it, but NO WAY he was behind the helm of this. It is a movie about a guy who isn't supposed to use his deadly fists any more. so then he pulls out the hands in front of the face ala Five Fingers of Death but then a couple seconds later, you are watching some movie that takes place in mexico and the fighting is only gonna get worse as teh movie goes on:(So I watched the final fight and it is so weird and stupid, and yet almost good, it has to be seen to be believed.I have this in the bretwood 10-pack, ""Tough Guys of Kung Fu"".Picture quality is just fine, wish the movie was."
5,Apt Title for this little book,"As I am wont to do, I came upon this book by way of a trek through books about Middle Eastern Chrisianity. This concise little book (169 pages) gives a detailed tour of Icons and their meanings. Ms. Mathewes-Green also includes illustrations of the most frequently seen icons which truly helps the reader.The author takes the reader on a tour of several holidays in the Orthodox church and explains the rituals and the importance of the Icons to these holidays.I highly recommend this book to anyone who has become interested in Icons. This would include members of other denominations. I recently read that a link has been established between early Orthodox Icons and the illuminations found in early British and Celtic religious books. We never really know where our reading will lead us.Enjoy"
1,2 out of 4 color plates,"Would have rated this 5 stars. . .but only TWO out of FOUR color plates were in the book. Since the book is commentary on the plates, that's a MAJOR problem."
5,Great for middle school children,"I am writing this review as a mother who has observed how much this book has meant to my daughter who has been struggling with typical middle school issues all year long. This book has quickly become her favorite book (and I am ordering her others in the series). She recommended it to her teacher, who wisely has added it to the class's reading list for the year's end.I often teach different versions of Cinderella to my college students, and you can see how the tale, the most popular in the world, is designed to empower young women at the point in their lives when they are struggling to be independent but also feel vulnerable. Meh Yah seems to have found a way to re-write a version of this versatile tale to serve this healing function in today's multi-cultural society."
2,Explaining or Understanding,"A ponderous treatment of the question whether international politics can best be studies scientifically--like say physics or chemistry--or by writing journalistic and historical accounts that may not exaplain things as prcesicely as scientific theories, yet provide a lot of real ""understanding"" of politics. The two authors take opposing views and drag out this pointless discussion to the point of no resolution."
1,would not buy fron this product again,"will not buy from the seller or this product,both are very hard to work with,battery did not charge up,try to get a replace from the seller they said I had to go to the manufature,went there took 2 months to get a new battery, and gusee what,it don't work ether,I try to get them to replace the player,they say it now out of werranty,and I have to go back to the seller and they say the same thing,they only have a 30 replayment,if you want a credit,you have to pay for shipping back to them,it was have the cost of the player to ship it back,now I have a player that doesn't work on the battery,it only works when it's plug into house curant or the car battery,I'm know a very happy camper with this seller or the manufacture,Leroy Redford"
5,This is a great player.,"This is a great player. It comes with a case, features 180 degrees adjustable viewing angle. It also comes with all the cords that are needed to use the player. It comes with a remote, ear-buds. YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS PLAYER."
3,sophomore effort of a bandleader/songwriter about to explode,"funky, quirky, attention-grabbing, maybe a little undercooked? very telling to listen to lion's mouth then Lovingspaceharmony, their new one."
2,Not the best review book available...,"While I haven't tried any of the other books available for the test, I have to say that this one is rather aggravating. The review itself isn't too bad, despite the fact that it starts in elementary school math and progressed to topics that I don't think would ever be on the test. The practice test is horrible, with questions accompanied by incorrect diagrams, doubled answer choices, incorrect answers and questions, etc. I ended up getting an 800 on the Math IIC test, so it might not be completely useless... but I'd still definately recommend trying another book."
4,Everything John does is perfect!,"John Travolta had the girls going wild in the late 70's with his hot dance moves and his sexy voice. He has the same effect on women today. His music is great! He made a superb comeback in the movies, why not go for a musical comeback as well. Your diehard fans always believe in you, John."
5,Beautiful CD,"Tina Malia is one of those musicians that I greatly admire. She is a classically trained vocalist, pianist and guitarist and is blessed with an incredibly beautiful voice. She also wrote and produced the entire CD.She sings of mystical things, maidens fair, and ships at sea with a beauty and passion I haven't heard since the early 90s when Sarah McLachlan first caught my attention. Tina's voice is almost as gorgeous as Sarah's (I dare say).This is the epitome of the beautiful album. The songs are intricately woven and excellently performed. If you are looking for a CD to play to relax to, dine to or get romantic to, this is it."
5,Incredible beauty and maturity for a young artist,"I listened to Tina Malia at an audio enabled bookstore and wow, she is superb. Her voice is rich, her compositions are full, not with electronic nuances but with complete instrumentals. Her songs go deep, touching the heart and soul. A deep peacefulness settles inside from listening to this magical album, I'm looking forward to much more from Tina."
5,Fantastic!,This is a fabulous album. I listened to the samples and made my purchase and I'm glad I did. Love the album. Tina Malia has a beautiful and soothing voice.
3,Commonplace blarney,The lyrics seem trite or contrived. The melodies seem common. The upper register of Ms. Malin's singing voice is wispy. I could not find one track of interest.
1,"PREDICTABLE, to far in the upper register, contrived","I have known Tina for many years and lived with her even, her music is all the same and never seems to progress in any other direction other than , neo-folk, high register, she is better off staying in coffee houses."
5,A must have album,"If you are a Loreena McKennett fan then you will love Tina Malia's Shores of Avalon. A five star +++, it is one of the best albums to come out since McKennett's ""The Book of Secrets."" I am already looking forward to Tina Malia's next album."
5,My Life with Pablo Neruda,"I got this book and have fallen in love instantly, within the first few chapters I had tears in my eyes. how wonderful to hear her side to this great love story. If you have read and loved Pablo Neruda's work, You should read this book written by the woman who was the muse for so many of his greatest works."
5,A shell hunters guidebook --- Maine to Florida,The Art of Shelling is loaded with interesting facts about shells and other beach collectibles. It provides detailed information on how and where to find shells at twenty-six locations in six East Coast states. I truly found this to be a great companion on my vacations at the beaches mentioned...as I found shells right where the book said I would!
2,Mediocre information,"The title leads one to believe the information will be far more detailed than it is. I ordered it mainly to get specifics on Sanibel Island FL, but didn't find out anything I didn't already know. I would only recommend this if you're just looking for new places to go for shelling."
2,Do Not use Unless You Absolutely Have To.,"Use the AV connections that come with the N64 if at all possible. Sure, if you are going to be toting your N64 around with you, they are a nice thing to have, but they give less quality, and greater headaches than the simple connections that come with the system. I used to take my N64 to friends' houses all the time, and for a while all I had was the RF adaptor (the AV was lost for a long time), and I was getting very tired of screwing it in and out, and to and from this and that... it was just a real pain.But the worst part of it all is that you cannot hook up the sound to your stereo if you choose to do so (as I do)!"
5,Works great. We can play N64 again!,My daughter wanted to bring the N64 to college but it wouldn't work on the tv. We ordered this and now her roommates are thrilled. They can all play all the old N64 games again. Works great!
1,"Awful, horrible, terrible. Avoid!","I should have learned when the 40GB model of this thing nearly destroyed my images (see my Amazon review of that model for the full story. Search Amazon for 'MediaGear Flash HD to Go 40GB'). I decided to give the 60GB model a try, thinking my 40GB had been a single bad unit. No such luck. The 60 failed and destroyed my images in almost exactly the same way. If I could give negative stars for this piece of junk, I would. Avoid this at all cost. Trust me.Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."
1,UNRELIABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I wish I read the other reviews before I bought this piece of junk. I, too, am FURIOUS over the lost pics. They were priceless to me. I lost probably a hundred or so out of several hundered that I took. Buy something more expensive or just get more cards. There are other options. I would smash this unit to bits with a hammer if I didn't think I could return it. Bottom line: DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not much Pang in this,"Contrary to the hype on the packaging, there isn't much Pang in these ""Pang Brothers"" discs. If you're expecting to get 3 hours of the same quality and frights as you would from a viewing of ""The Eye"", then move on.""The Omen"" was written by a Pang, but directed and edited by someone completely different. ""Bangkok Haunted"" is a three-story anthology, only one of which is directed by Oxide Pang... which is good. But that's all the Pang this 2-movie ""Pang Brothers"" really only has to offer."
2,"Wang yu not all that bad in this one, but god, what a crappy movie","I got this movie as a four pack for $2. I definitely wasn't dissapointed, while snake crane secret is the only one I like in this, screaming ninja isn't the worst movie ever. This is kinda like wang yu's rage of the master(which is in the four-paCK), meaning they both costed about $10,000 to make. They actually could have costed $10 and I wouldn't have noticed the difference. Overall Screaming tiger has a ton of non-realistic fights, but the final fight did nothing special. The fact they were fighting on a moving train was cool, but they should have done some really cool stunts. The final fight is just sloppy and you start to wonder if you are gonna make it through to the end. Hard movie to watch, but if you are a HUGE, MonSTROUS Wang Yu fan, I think you will like it."
5,Wang Yu Rules!!,Wang Yu Rules rules in this martial arts movie set in early 1900's China.It's a must see with good style and good fights!!
4,Simple and Good,It was hard to find a t'meter with this high of a range w/o going digital. I was glad to find this one. It works just like it should. No instructions needed.
5,jody watley the make over,A FANTASTIC CD BY the one and the original diva JODY WATLEY!A must listen & BUY to all music fans.... THANK U miss W A T L E Y ;-)
3,Beautiful life,"The best track on this disc is ""Beautiful life"". It has a fabulous beat, and wonderful lyrics you cant get out of your head. (Hopefully, before releasing another full length CD, it will be available as a cd single with some wonderful remixes!)Other stand outs are ""Borderline"" and the #1 hit ""I want your love"".Overall, this is a worthwhile purchase. But in no way is it near the perfection that was ""Midnight Lounge"".** Had she re-imagined the rare, practically forgotten ""All the way to heaven"" instead of ""Friendz"", alot more of us would be in heaven with regards to this release.Maybe next time?"
1,what???????,I just did not feel anything from this effort. I was wondering where is jodi coming from? This is awful. If she is going to cover some classic songs she needs to bring it or leave them alone. What is going on Jodi? This is a poor effort.
1,where is my damn cd?,"i thought the point of a pre-order was you get it on or about the date it was released. i've had this cd ordered since july 19th - it's been out since tuesday, today's saturday. i ordered it off of amazon and i still don't have it and it doesn't look like it's shipping anytime soon. i don't have any virgin stores close so what the hell am i supposed to do? i want to cancel and hopefully i'd get it sooner ordering somewhere else! not blaming jody - just amazon."
5,Daniel Ervin,"JODY WATLEY, HAS ALWAYS BEEN A GIFTED SONG WRITER TALENTED PERFORMER AND SINGER, THIS 2ND INSTALLMENT OF THE MAKEOVER IS NO EXCEPTIONS. I LOVE IT, IT IS A MUST HAVE ONCE AGAIN MS. WATLEY HAS PROVEN THAT ELECTRONIC MUSIC CAN COVEY JUST AS MUCH EMOTION AS ANY OTHER GENRE OF MUSIC,FINALLY A 10 MIN DANCE VERSION OF LOVE HANGOVER,A SEXY REMAKE OF ERASURE'S LITTLE RESPECT,SHE DOES AN OUTSTANDING JOB OF WILL YOU STILL LOVE ME TOMORROW, HER VOCALS ON THIS SONG ARE AMAZING, WAITING IN VAIN. A NEW BRAZILIAN STYLE VERY GOOD. OVERALL THIS VERSION OF THE MAKEOVER IS MUCH MORE UPTEMPO THAN THE 2006 VERSION. EXCELLENT PRODUCTION FROM MS. JODY WATLEY SO IF ELECTRONIC SOUL IS WHAT YOUR INTO. THE MAKEOVER IS A MUST HAVE."
4,Positive Power,"THE MAKEOVER is Miss Watley's ninth studio album, and the fourth on her own Avitone label. Jody's positive attitude and jazzy dance vibes are refreshing in today's world of cookie-cutter r&b sex kittens. The cover tunes (Madonna's ""Borderline"", Diana Ross ""Love Hangover"", Bob Marley's ""Waiting In Vain"", Chic's ""I Want Your Love"" and an interesting Carpenters medley) are completely rearranged to sound like new songs instead of a night at a karaoke bar, while original tunes like ""A Beautiful Life"", ""The Makeover Superstar"" and ""Bed of Roses"" are uplifting without being preachy. The only misstep here is a remake of Jody's 1989 top-10 hit ""Friends"", a song that does not have much of a melody in the first place."
3,notting hill,"We got this cd to sing ""When you say nothing at all"" at a wedding and it was suffice. The only issue I had was the background music was out of tune at a time when it was completely obvious, the flute goes flat!! Other than that it was good."
4,This is a must have.,"This CD is packed with energy. This is a great CD that is well worth the investment. Personally, you will find out that anything that features Mestre Toni Vargas is worth buying. He's like the Luther Vandross of Capoeira. I feel he is the best Capoeira vocalist yet. Although the sound quality does not match Mestre Acordeon, there are more songs on this CD worth listening to and it gives you more of a traditional feel for Capoeira Regional and Angola. You can not go wrong with this CD. You will not be Disappointed. This is a must have."
5,Great! More fun than the originals!,"Slinky, jazzy and playfully understated, harpist Lorin Grean gives her distinctive take on famous classic rock and folk numbers. Included are arrangements of ""Can't Find My Way Home"" (Steve Winwood), ""Eleanor Rigby"" (The Beatles), ""She's Not There"" (Rod Argent), ""Big Yellow Taxi"" (aka. ""They Paved Paradise and Put Up a Parking Lot"")(Joni Mitchell), ""Every Breath You Take"" (Sting), and ""I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For"" (U2). Grean's quiet renditions and intimate vocals truly bring the words of these songs to life, rather than overshadowing them with shouting, drumming or loud electric guitars. Delicate harp riffs and improvisations fill in the familiar harmonic structure of each selection, taking it from ""same-old-same-old-heard-it-a-thousand-times-before"" status to new and intricately beautiful. Lorin Grean's equally appealing original compositions can be heard on her other release, ""Hand Woven""."
5,Huge expansion on earlier work,"My first experiance of Louise Cooper was ""Lord Of No Time"" a 1977 book that told the tale of the mage Tarod and how he fell foul of his one time friend Keridil Toln. I loved it and hoped that the characters would appear in additional volumes. They did but not in the way expected, Louise Cooper rewrote the whole thing, spreading it out over the three volumes of the Time Master trilogy. Fortunately at no time does it lose the sharp freshness of the original, it's well worth getting hold of as is the subsequent series The Chaos Gate trilogy, though I would only give that four stars."
5,Finally!,"I read the first two books in the Time Master Trilogy at the age of 15, and fell in love with them. Now that I am 22, I have gone back to re-read them, and began my search for the third book in the series. This proved more difficult than I had thought, but my efforts paid off eventually when I found a tattered copy in a local used book store.It is truly a mesmerizing trilogy, and I know this won't be the last time I read it! I highly recommend this series, plus another book by the same author entitled ""The Mirage""."
5,great dutch group!!!,"This is the first CD for that new dutch band. All the songs were writen by them or for them. They go from nice slow balades to great soft rock numbers. I love all the songs on it! Great beat to exercise with!!! You couldn't believe that they are young adults who just finish the Dutch version off ""making the band"". Great band, great CD, can't get enough off them"
4,Good Stuff . . . Mostly,"I am not much on reviews, but there is some good stuff in Sol Stein's book. It was recommended by a professor in one of my fiction workshops at The Johns Hopkins University. But, like with any ""advice"", you have to away that which is useful and leave behind the rest."
4,worthwhile,"If you can get past the author's arrogance, this is a pretty good book. I bought it because I felt I needed a better understanding of how to use plot. This book has a lot of good pointers, although there were some things I disagreed with here and there. Mostly it got annoying to spend every other sentence reading about something brilliant Sol Stein had published or something brilliant he'd written himself or how brilliantly brilliant all his students thought he was. But if you can get past that, this is a worthwhile book, and it's very easy to understand and utilize."
5,Great advice!,"I bought this book a few months ago at the advice of a fellow journalist. He told me that this book is half fiction, half non-fiction but the advice is helpful. Without a doubt, the words of wisdom that Stein has to offer are priceless. However, when I thought about writing a novel, this is where I turned. From there I now have the basis for my story and will write it during National Novel Writing Month. Get the book, whether you're interested in non-fiction, fiction or both. Be prepared to be honest with yourself and have fun writing!"
2,Not As Great as The Hype,"I think the advice is basically sound. But it is not new or different from anyone else's advice. He has a tendency to beat a subject to death, taking 40 pages to make a statement that could easily be communicated in a single paragraph. He may know a lot about writing but his style is tedious, redundant and awkward. The examples are good except the examples from his own work seem to be the worst. I say he should stick to editing and forget about writing about writing."
4,Rocketfuel for writer's dream,"""Stein on Writing"" has been my companion for some time now. And what a great time! It's totally boosted my ability to look upon my own writing. Before I purchased ""Stein on Writing"" things were going round in circles; I kept working the way I've always done. But after reading the book - and using it reguarly - I feel like a rocket loaded with premium fuel! I'm high on the fumes from the fuel and energy is running through my veins. And what is it, Sol Stein does so brilliantly? Well first of all he keeps everything easy. Making writing an everyday normality. Then - when it get's tougher - he makes the hardship of the next steps in writing a novel seem like sheer fun. And before You know, you're through. Through reading his book. And through writing your magnificent work of your own!With best regards - Preben Ch. Dahl, Denmark"
5,Do not write another word until you read this book!,An absolute eye opener. I never realized how much I did not know about writing until I read this book. I quit writing for a few days until I could read the book so that I understood everything that Mr. Stein was trying to get across. Just one read through has improved my writing tremendously and I plan to reread this book every month until it all sinks in.
3,Worth your while,"One of the better writing guides out there. The chapters on how to edit--cut away fluff, avoid florid prose, alter word order--are helpful, if familiar to advanced writers. The author is a bit long-winded and prone to self-promotion (look at the book's subtitle--holy cow!) but he's also competent and experienced. Parts of the book deal exclusively with fiction or non-fiction, which saves time for writers who specialize in one or the other. Overall a smooth and fruitful read."
5,My agent recommended it.,I am so glad my agent recommended this book. Beginning and more advanced writers will each find valuable tips. Stein's section on dialogue is great! Editing and revising no longer seem insurmountable problems. I wish I had read this when I first started writing ten years ago.
3,Don't expect the freebies they offer...,"Book is pretty good, but it offers a free DVD (after 6 month update), a Palm version (not really available on their web site), and free MP3's from the author to listen to while commuting (also nor really available on their web site). I feel cheated, as the front and back of the book promise all these freebies, but in reality, Syngress doesn't follow through... Be warned"
2,"Could be better, much better!","I was really hoping this book would be THE E2K BOOK! I was wrong: poorly written, really weird chapter structure (actual installation of E2K is reviewed in Chapter 6!!), thoughts are not clearly expressed and important details are missed out. Will work as a quick reference (partly) but you will want to buy at least another book on the subject. Too bad tech-for-tech approach didn't work this time. I'll wait until O'Reily comes up with one."
5,Gorgeous and inspired,"This is simply a beautiful book. My son loves to read it and so do I. The story is wonderfully out of the box and the illustrations are pleasure to lose yourself in. I breathe a sigh of relief when my son asks for it, cause I just don't get tired of reading Stanley Books. Craig Frazier's work is consistantly exquisite and quirky."
3,The last part is OK..,"The main gimmick is that the main character uses a silver spear; to stab, poke and slash with great aplomb.Most of the grainy film is pretty boring and it has been directly transferred to DVD with no clean up, BUT there are some good fight scenes to be found here. Fast forward to the last 20 minutes of the film, lots of bloody action."
4,Do you like kung fu movies?,"I am an avid fan of martial arts films, and trust me I've seen some bad ones, so I was saddend to come across such a bad review for such a good film. Yes the sound effects are bit hammy but that adds to the film. Unlike a lot of old martial arts films the story line makes sense, the fight seens are good and the magic weapons are fantastic. The characters are played excelently, and I have to say that the boy in the film is instramentle to one of the best ending fight seens ever, that alone deserves more than one star. I suggest if the matrix is what you call a good kung fu movie or your searching for a crouching tiger... then don't look here. If you loved 'the killer meteor' get this film and remeber... ""Ma Chin, the spell of your magic sword has been broken -- by me!"""
4,Old School Stuff,I love this movie for sentimental reasons. I watched it when I was seven years old and it made an impression on me especially the end scene. The I grew up and could'nt remember the name of the film yet the way the movie ended haunted me for years. Only recently I described what I could remember from the movie (after 28yrs.) to fellow members on the Jet Li website and they gave me the title. I took their word for it and bought it at Amazon.com and today I'm a happy person
2,NOT MUCH BLOOD AND NO NINJAS,"IN THE FILM CREDITS IT'S CALLED BLOOD OF THE DRAGON,IT TAKES PLACE IN CHINA AND THE PLOT IS ABOUT A LONE FIGHTER TRYING TO STOP A POLLITICAL ASSASINATION WITH THE HELP OF A CHILD. DON'T LET THE TITLE FOOL YOU, IF YOUR LOOKING FOR NINJA FILMS LOOK ELSEWARE THERE ARE NO NINJAS HERE AND NOT EVEN ONE KATANA SWORD EITHER."
3,children's folk dance,"This sounds like a good children's CD. I'm a folk dance teacher, and I've heard lots of folk dance music!"
1,Wrong music to song titles,"The music I heard on this site does not match the song titles listed. This may be a wonderful CD, but I would not buy it based on the samples I heard. I am a Folk Dance teacher and I know what these song titles should sound like. It may be the fault of going online from wrong CD!"
2,"Rough statement of the obvious, without detail",This book appears to be a rough statement of the obvious without providing any detail. I wish I would have picked a more helpful book. I have occasionally stumbled across a helpful statement.
3,Just Ok...,"I'm always looking for the best possible portable speaker system for my MP3 player. (For the record I have a Creative Nomad Jukebox ZenXtra--sounds like my player has four different names!) Anyway, while the speakers are sorta nifty in appearance, and have quite a bit of volume on them, I'm not super impressed with the overall sound quality. I'm still searching in vain for the thing that will give me a feeling of rich bass sound, and this one misses the mark on that point almost completely. Overall not a bad doo-dad to have on one's desk at work, and it does increase the ""wow"" factor from coworkers, but if the sound is what you're after you may be a bit disappointed. I am."
2,"Decent speakers, but you can do better","The Isphere's design was great, but I experienced a great deal of white noise coming from the speakers, whether there was music playing or not. The speakers were really easy to set up - it took me 2 min. from the point of getting the box open to playing music off my mp3 player ( I have the Dell pocket DJ). The Zip Connect is a brilliant feature. I got the speakers to listen to music at work. There was plenty of volume, even when I cranked it up after hours. I was annoyed that I could not control the base or the tremble. There certainly was not enough base to the speakers. This item is way overpriced at $150. I think you can do a lot better for your money."
2,Serial Adapter Compactflash Card,I did not like it because it would not work for the application for which I purchased it. I was using it to access a Vaisala 555B weather station. I tried an early version Quatech Model: SSCFR-100 which worked great with my Dell Axim X50 PDA. I don't understand why it would not work.
2,Frustrating to say the least,"Don't buy this price increased version. I doesn't work any better than the $19.95 model. Plus it uses twice the amount of batteries. The concept is great, the graphics are great and that's the end of it. This just like the first plug and play Ms Pacman (which I also bought) and has a joy stick issue. If the manufacturer would take off the games that need the twisting action of the joy stick maybe this would actually be fun to play instead of frustrating. While playing Ms Pacman which is the ONLY reason I bought these plug and plays Ms Pacman has a mind of her own, turns corners on her own and runs into the ghosts on her own. It's impossible to use the joy stick without twisting it during play and then you're out of control. It's extremely frustrating. For as popular as Pacman and Ms Pacman were in their day and still are these plug and plays would sell on that merit alone so take off the games needing the turning action of the joystick."
5,Premier South American Classical,Gustavo Tavares et al. deliver a fresh and exciting contribution to classical music. They represent a new departure that will be noticed and appreciated.
2,The Pen-Faulkner Award?,"DeLillo has done much better than this. It is difficult to care about characters that sound identical to each other, with no redeeming qualities or unique identities of their own. At times DeLillo presents wonderful images and prose, but the bulk of this book features rambling prose and pointless dialogue. One wonders if DeLillo is writing to the public or for himself.Without question, I will continue to read DeLillo. He has much to say and one of the best writers we have, but readers new to DeLillo would do well to read ""Underworld"" and ""White Noise"" and avoid ""Mao II."""
2,A disappointment,"I like Don DeLillo. ""White Noise"" is among my favorite books of the 1980s. But he really drops the ball here. This book reads like an unrevised first draft. The diamond-hard sentences of ""White Noise"" have now given way to flaccid stream-of-consciousness mumbling. The plot is similarly unfocused; I kept expecting all these threads to tie together more neatly, but they never do. And the flimsy scenario DeLillo has contrived here can hardly support all these grandiose meditations on contemporary society, which seem forced into the texture of the novel. One soon tires of lengthy scenes in which the characters dilate endlessly upon the social importance of the evening news, while saying things like ""I have my own cosmology of pain."" Give DeLillo credit: he has important things to say. The problem is that he's said everything here more memorably in previous books."
5,Great Book by a Great Writer,"This is without a doubt one of the best novels of this decade, and one of the best by one of the best American writers. The totality of the thing gets under your skin, inside your eyeballs, makes you see in a different way. A great work of art."
2,"Disappointing effort after the brilliance of ""Libra""","I looked forward to reading this book after reading Libra, but I found it too pushy in it's imagery. It seemed DeLillo felt he had to dazzle the reader with his ability to string metaphors together, but all he really did was to create an empty string of random thoughts that never really come together as a cohesive picture."
2,Lacking in focus and clarity,"I really enjoyed ""White Noise."" I found the characters and the story interesting. ""Mao II"" falls way short of the level of ""White Noise."" The story seems to lack focus. DeLillo seems to be trying to make social commentary with every little detail here. This reader ultimately had very little concern for the characters or curiousity over the eventual outcome."
1,I DON'T LIKE IT,NOT TO DEMEAN MR. DELILLO'S QUALITY AS A WRITER. . .BUT I DID NOT CARE FOR THIS BOOK.
5,a non-cult classic,"a salinger-esqu writer, an ex-cult member, and the most talented assistant of all time are the residents of a house in the middle of no where. coming into this abode is a photographer, and her presence brings about remarkable changes. mao II is a fantastic look into the life of a writer and a thoroughly enjoyable read, unless, of course, if you're in a cult, in which case it's the best book you'll read, ever."
3,good book only if you already know the subject,"this is a great reference if you already know digital communication, but definitely not something that you read cover to cover. i hated this book when i was first forced to study from it, but on a second glance and a few years of research in communication theory, i like it quite a lot. definitely good for refreshing your memory or learning small things, but not for learning communication theory. you're much better off with the Proakis/Salehi ""Communication System Engineering"" book."
2,Mediocre,I have an earlier version of this book and I also had Dr. Proakis as a professor in graduate school. Dr. Proakis has a nack of making something simple into something complex. His teaching style is similar. I always thought com theory was very difficult until I read books by others that discussed the same topics in a more cogent and lucid style.
3,TELECOM Engineer...To complex!! NOT practical.,"My teacher at Georgia Tech said..""this is like the bible of digital communication""..and certainly it is like the bible, confusing and too complex. Theory wise, OK it serves well, but as a reference for practice..get Lee and Messerchmitt!!"
3,Difficult to read and few examples,I found this book tries to cover a lot of topics. So it becomes too brief and too few examples that I don't really learn much.
5,excellent condition.,It's almost brand new. Very good condition. I like it. This is an excellent book. Good choice for EE students.
5,Great book!,"It is one of the best (if not THE best) books in digital communication systems. It provides excellent theoretical analyses and it is a great resource for researchers, engineering students as well as practitioners."
2,Digital Communications - Proakis,"The author does a horrible job at explaining the concepts. Moreover, the use of examples is not adequate. If you already have a relative good understanding of the topics you planning to read in the book, you may be able to understand his explanations. Otherwise, it could be difficult to understand the subject. I already ordered Lathi's book in digital and analog communications. I have not yet received the book but I believe Lathi wiriting style is better than Proakis style."
3,A solid book,"I own this book and I used it to learn the fundamentals of Digital communications. This is a very solid and comprehensive book, but requires very strong math background. I don't think it can be used as a self-study resource. It must be part of an instructor-led graduate course. This book is probably the best book for communication theory. But it is not easy to use for engineers in the field."
4,"Yep, it's a pasta machine","This works exactly like it is supposed to work. It is a pasta machine. So, you insert a chunk of dough, turn the crank, and out comes a thinner piece of pasta. I've used this twice now, both times to make ravioli in partner with a separately purchased ravioli press and once I fed the leftover dough from the ravioli through the fettuccine cutter just for fun. All the items have boiled up just fine and I've gotten rave reviews. These are the first times I have attempted to make pasta, so any of the problems I've had with the finished product have been more on my inexperience that anything. As far as the pasta machine goes, the crank does come out occasionally and the clamp has fallen on the floor a few times. Watch your feet. For the price, though, these are not big problems and this thing is basically perfect for my extremely infrequent pasta making needs."
2,no a very good pasta machine,The machine does not work as I expect to. It does not turn very smoothly when making pasta and it just stuck there everytime when you make the pasta
2,Uneven Cuts,"Purchased this machine January 2012. Making Fettuccini, my dough is fine, the first batch of noodles came out great, the noodles came out cut cleanly separated and ready for the rack. On my second, and third batches the blades weren't cutting the noodles properly - every other row was coming out ""perforated"" and not cut completely through. I opened up the blade housing, and I tried to adjust it - there is no place to adjust. Disappointed and now getting another (read more $$) model."
4,This is not Cruise Control,"This machine is easy to use. Simply clean the machine as per instruction. Yes, there is a bit of technique to using this machine. If you arent willing to take the time learn how to use it... spend the extra money on a cuisinart. As for those of us who like to prepare by hand, we can appreciate this machine for being a short cut...without spending that extra money. The more time I spent using this machine, the less often the handle comes out when I crank it. Only thing I might've considered before I bought this item is that it is only 6 inches wide."
