5,Wonderful if you know how to use it,"I love this thing and I think that the reviews that state it not feeling as great as described is due to set up error... The product comes with the tines flat and you have to rotate them out around the handle so that it will go around your head. The MOST important part is to ADJUST the diameter of the tines! If you leave it as is it will be far too tight (my head is too small for baseball hats and it's still too tight) and will feel scratchy. The idea is to get the tines so that they only LIGHTLY expand over your scalp. Let me tell you, it's an amazing feeling. It's a cheapo product because it's a simple product - you don't need anything fancy! The only way to make it better is if it came with a person to use it on you (it feels much better when not self-administered). Give it a try, you can thank me after you get it."
4,A fun item,"This doesn't actually massage your head, but it sure gives a great scratching sensation. The only problem is that a couple of the balls at the end of the wires have a rough spot on them. They don't hurt, but aren't as smooth as the others."
4,Pretty good,"This massager won't give you the sensation the product description promisies- its more like a head scratcher- but, I like the way it felt on my head. Well made (although the copper on mine was a little rusted when I got it, but, no big deal). The copper smell does get on my nerves, though. Makes a great back/ foot massager."
3,Head Massager or Head Scratcher?,"I have been wanting to get one these for a long time. The ones I have tried in the past have been relaxing. The one from Head Trip had rough tips which scratched rather than rubbed. Not nice! I will try to file down the tips, so the tips are more rounded off...but overall, I think it will be nice and will get the job done!"
2,Maybe something to consider if you have an ITCH.,"I was somewhat disappointed. I had used one similar to this a couple of years ago and thought it was wonderful. This doesn't work quite the same. The prongs bend out of shape too easily and the ends are rough, so it scratches more than massages. The price seemed reasonable, but then again, I don't think the original one I tried years ago had any reason to cost more than that...it's not some master engineered product."
3,"itchy, scratchy","the product is great, except.....it wasn't big enough for the large head of the recipient that it was purchased for. but everyone else LOVED it. i guess it's not one size fits all."
2,head massager,"The product was as pictured, BUT, the balls on the end of the wires are TOO SMALL. They need to be larger so you don;t scratch your head.Not happy with it and don't use it."
3,Okay,I found this to be a very mediocre purchase. How pleasant it feels depends on how much pressure you like when massaged because it provides a very firm pressure.
2,Seen better,"My sister has one that I love and thought this was it. I don't like this one because the tongs move and don't stay in position. Plus, the ends have a knot on it that make the massage a little to hard on the head."
2,I'd pass on this... get the foot roller insead.,"I wasn't very pleased with this. First, some of the little ball-ends have rough spots, which you pretty much can't get rid of. Second, it's hard to bend the tines to hit evenly all around your head. Third, it didn't really make the scalp tingle like ones I've seen in malls. This company has good products but this one is just so-so. I also bought their foot roller, and that thing is great. This.. not so much."
1,This must be a joke!,"We received this in the mail from a company called Ink Link. We didn't order it, and we wonder if it is a gag gift. It feels like someone made it out of coat hangers. We are saving it for a white elephant party."
4,"Too many rods, but good.","I bought this for a gift, and was eager to try it myself.Theres twice as many rods as I can handle, theres just too much sensation, and I had a negative reaction after a few seconds.If I had one for myself I'd break off half of the rods and rate it 5 stars.It seems you can ""unfold"" the rods a few times but I wasnt sure if this would loosen them up in the handle, so I recommended she didnt mess with themAs far as it being ""scratchy"", I have no idea how they can say this. Theirs probably has a defect. The ends are smooth as silk. I'm sure they can be sanded or buffed out, or even treated with clear nail polish to make it smooth if need be."
1,Piece of Junk!!!,What is the point of this thing? It does not work and is not worth the money. You can use your own fingertips and get a better massage than this thing will give.
1,Migraine sufferers beware!,"I got a horrible migraine from this ""therapeutic massager"". I was sick for three days. It made me feel foggy --almost like I had a seizure. People with migraines or seizure activity should be careful."
1,"Not the best Head ""tickler""","I've tried many brands of these ""head ticklers"". I absolutely love these things but this specific model is terrible. Very rigid fingers and big balls on the end result in a terrible experience. I suggest this one:Scalp Massager (Colors May Vary)My absolute favorite."
2,STUPID,"FUNNY IN CONCEPT BUT IN REALITY, NOT SO MUCH. GAVE IT TO SOMEONE NAMED HAPPY ON HER BIRTHDAY. HA, HA, SCRATCH, SCRATCH. CHUCK IT ASIDE. TOO MUCH MONEY FOR A GIGGLE AND WIRES ON A STICK."
3,Scratchy,I ordered this after my sister brought one over from Europe. I really loved how it made my scalp tingle. When this one arrived it was heavier material and doesn't quite have the same affect. The price is great you really can't beat it. I still get a good massage it relieves stress I just wish the prongs were lighter material.
2,Didn't Do Anything for Me,"The quality is so-so, and it really didn't do anything for me. It's clumsy to work with. All in all, I think I can give myself a better head massage with my own hands."
3,This really feels good.,The massager is a great way to relax. The only thing wrong with this one is that the ends are not as finished as we would like. It can be a little rough. We fixed that by putting glue on the ends. I would recommend getting a little more expensive one. Maybe the ends would be better.
1,not quite what i expected,its easily bendable so its adjustable but i expected it to be a little more comfortable to use. if you ignore the way it digs into your scalp its quite an interesting feeling but it actually scratches the scalp so i wont be using it.
5,"My ""Ben Ten Experience"".","I found out about ""Ben Ten"" from my young nephew. I researched these figures in depth. Heat Blast is great. I am very happy about this purchase. I have one regret, I wished I had also purchased the ""Heat Blast"" transformer figure, Santa got mixed up and my nephew received 2. On the contrary, he didn't care, he loves them both. Thanks Amazon."
3,Couldn't ignore technical problems,"After reading the first 20-30 pages of this book, I found myselfso distracted by all of the typos and technical errors that Icouldn't continue with it. It seems to me that an expert ondigital photography should be able to keep mega_pixels_ andmega_bytes_ straight. I got tired of mentions of 5MB cameras andsuch. There are numerous other examples, but I already returnedthe book and can't cite them all from memory.If you can overlook this, then I have a feeling the other reviewsthat say this is good for beginners are on the mark."
5,Wow!!,"...I've been an amateur photographer for 15 years, and my husband bought me a Canon Powershot A40 and this book for my birthday. I'm no stranger to photography, but I'm amazed at the effects I've already been able to achieve with Adobe Elements and the use of this book. I particularly appreciated the chapter on special effects and the one on cataloging and archiving images."
1,Find something else...,This is not a good tool. The black handle came off mine almost immediately. I haven't even finished working the first dent with it yet and the nut that the slide strikes has managed to strip the thread off the bar. The threads are not well cut and I get the impression that the tool in general is made of too-soft metal.I'd highly recommend finding a different slide hammer.
1,"Great book, horrible translation and publisher.","The information shown in this listing is incorrect. This edition is published by a company called 'Seven Treasures' and makes no mention of who the translator is. I read first half of the Sverre Lyngstad version, but lost my copy. I picked this one up because of the attractive price and was unable to continue reading due to the quality of the translation. Go with a publisher and translator you can trust."
2,The Create Space Edition is WORTHLESS,"I bought this book because it was recommended to me. I got the Create Space edition (they are apparently one of these fly-by-night publisher that are popping up everywhere printing anything in the public domain on demand). I have no idea who the translator is because that information is not included in the Create Space edition. The translator must have been truly awful. Or this book and author are overrated or both. That aside, this is the kind of book a young man - one who is currently misanthropic, but will ultimately join the Peace Corps - would get passionate about. Ultimately, I wouldn't read it again, even if someone handed me the ""definitive"" translation. I'd reread Kafka."
1,Avoid this reprint edition,"This edition has a good price, which is why I bought it, but has been poorly proofread. For example, on the first page this book says, ""From where I was standing I had a view of a clothes, line and an open field."" Clearly this should be, ""From where I was standing I had a view of a CLOTHESLINE and an open field."" Very shoddy. There are more errors throughout.Also, according to other reviewers, this translation has been slightly abridged, or has some passages expurgated.Get the Penguin edition instead."
3,Maybe a Bit Overrated?,"So finally I came across this much praised book by Knut Hamsun. Well in my opinion it is a little bit overrated. I mean it's OK, but it's very repetitive in it's nature. It's the story about this crazy young man running around doing crazy things in Norway's capital, at that time called Christania. There is actually no development in the novel, we just witness these crazy excesses of the principal, things like saying weird things to coincidental people on the streets etc. I think Hamsun envisioned the book as a comedy depicting the craziness and idiosyncrasies of the young artist. People who liked this book should proceed with Sigurd Hoel's ""Meeting at the Milestone"". That's another good Norwegian book. I think you'll like it!"
2,Confusing sku system,"I was trying to do an exact replacement for a bag that my brother had which had this sku number on it: 64079. When the bag from Amazon came, it was not the same dimensions or same material, though the design was generally the same. I later learned that Kensington has a system where they use the sku 64079, but then add a random letter afterwords to designate a different model, design, material, year, I don't really know why they do it. But this was frustrating to learn after I had placed the order and received the bag. It was purchased as a Christmas gift and by the time it came, I did not have time to exchange it.The bag that I received was a taller, narrower bag that seemed to be made of cheaper material."
1,Not what they used to be,"I have had 3 of these bags over the past few years. The first lasted a very long time and was a great bag. I replaced it with the same model, and this one only lasted a year or so. I replaced that one a few months ago and it is already starting to come apart (you can stick your hand right through the bottom of the bag - exactly where you don't want it to break). I have to conclude that they have started to build these more cheaply than they used to. I won't be buying a 4th Kensington. Too bad, because I really like the form factor of the bag."
2,Misleading Name,"This is not a saddlebag for transporting a laptop. What exactly is ""saddlebag"" about this? How do I attach this to my rear fender?"
4,Travel Bag,Very nice notebook carrying case for travel. The bag is of good quality and well made. I am very please with the purchase.
4,exactly what I wanted,"I was buying this to replace a bag I have that is similar. I was a bit wary of the purchase because I liked my old bag so much: it had been with me daily for 11 years. I was also concerned that the outer material would look too cheep to use in a business setting, but it doesn't. The only flaw I see is that the flap is a bit lightweight. I think it will blow around a good deal if not clipped (something I never did with my last bag. Also the clips on the backpack straps are hard to get undone and plastic. As I am not planning on using it as a backpack, this is not a deal-breaker for me, but it would be a consideration for people planning on converting it a lot, or using it as a backpack a lot."
2,"Except for the broken seams, it is great","The bag works well except when it breaks. The side seams all tore apart on me. I had to duck tape it back together to make it work. The duck tape seems to be holding, but I will not buy another one. Others on here seem to have the same problem."
4,Rugged enough for constant use,"I've travelled nearly 250,000 miles with my laptops, papers, accessories, etc in one of these, and it's proven itself up to the task.The front pocket is useful for storing business cards, O'Reilly pocket guides, passport(s), tickets, etc. for easy access. The large main pocket has a padded space for a laptop (my Dell fits it either way around) and on my model has 4 dividers that are useful for keeping CD cases and cables disentangled. The shoulder straps / backpack straps can be detached and/or hidden inside the case for a more professional look (though if I needed to care more about presentation I would probably have a regualar briefcase)After 2 1/2 years of constant use the padding in the shoulder straps is starting to become compressed, and there are some tears on the vinyl inside, but give how much use I've made of this backpack this is probably normal wear and tear."
2,"Great design, but ""fragile""","I bought this product because I'm impressed with the feature it has, and as a customer support engineer I need the computer case that has a professional look at the customer place but should be comfortable enough to carry on the street. Most of the time I carry it as a backpack. But it's not tough as it should be. It last only 1 month and the inner side between the padded computer compartment began to tear. Because it has a lifetime warranty, I went back to the shop and got a new one. After a month plus the inner side (I will say it as a weakness) starting to tear again and then I will go back to the shop to replace it."
5,Outstanding,"This is easily the best laptop bag I've ever had. I have carried it around the world easily more than 20 times and it is only just now showing wear. I would never buy a different one. It's light, has a secret pouch that holds cards, money, anything perfectly safely, impossible to slip a laptop out of surreptitiously, has dozens of places to put stuff--I have my routine down pat and have even used it as a pillow on long flights.I really hope they don't stop making this bag."
5,Excellent Product,I purchased an Audio-Technica wireless microphone system for my church several years ago. The system has served us extremly well. A few months ago the mic cable developed a problem so I purchased a replacement AT829cW Condenser Mic. The new mic works great and audio quality is quite robust. I expect excellent service from this microphone for years to come.
3,I wish the stem from the connection was stronger,"Pros:-Works wellCons:-Cord breaks easily, I think that this is due to the individuals using the mics and then wraping the thin cord around the box and throwing it in a drawer. The majority of the breaks on these cords have occured near the stem of the input connection. I suggest shrink wrapping that portion of the wire in order to increase the stability of the cable."
4,Great clip on mic,"Great little lapel mic at a good price. Not crazy about the clip, but I used the one off my old mic; much smaller, less noticeable."
4,Something to Look Forward To,"Marianne Curley's second book in this Trilogy was something I've been waiting for.Once recieved, it was something I could not be torn away from. The plot is ominous and foreboding and there are many secrets that you're just dying to find out. BR>Overall, I enjoyed THE DARK and am very glad I bought it.I suggest reading THE NAMED first otherwise you'll be quite confused. But don't worry, the first is great anyway. Maybe better."
3,So-so,"The second installment had a lot of action, and the story moved quickly. The writing is mediocre with unrealistic, stilted dialogue, though."
5,Loved it!,Couldn't put down!!! A must read - of course read the first book. I can't wait to read the next one!
4,They float upright!,"Whimsical little guys... the best part is that they actually float upright in the the bathtub. It sounds silly, but most ducks if you get them will end up floating on their sides or upside down. These guys are weighted properly so they don't look like a dead duck in water. :-p"
1,This is appalling,"Teach your kid to use Weights and Measures and poison him/herself with sugar and empty calories at the same time!Perhaps Hershey's should also create a book on Dental Hygiene,weight control and the advantages of hyperactivity.I suppose this is approved by the Bush administration's Dept. of Education. Anything to keep corporate America happy! Pathetic."
5,Poetic,I loved watching this movie because of the way it's put toghter. Buy it or rent it and you will see what I mean -- just keep an open mind. Mark
4,Intense,"It was heavy watching the main character go through his darker moments when he had his seizure and went crazy. it was too personal and disturbing even though it was no doubt necessary for the story, I thought the movie was much more interesting than what's usually out there. I definitely recommend it."
5,I strongly recommend it.,"I watched USA The Movie and I have to say that I was really impressed. America has been through a lot. America made too many mistakes and sometimes you just can't help it. The movie shows that clearly and it definitely shows the consequences. Great and memorable audio, amazing collage of human expressions and definitely a great story with an odd, strange fellow named Kirk. I strongly recommend you to see this movie."
1,Do not buy this!!,This was the single worst purchase i ever made on Amazon. If you have a vauge conception of history and current world events you will learn nothing from this film. You will only be subjected to mediocre art house film and very low quality audio track that will probaly give you a headache.
5,Amazing,"I have waited 40 years to see this movie again after seeing it in a drive-in movie theater in Capetown. It is not for the faint hearted or politically correct. Though some scenes are pitifully staged, most appears genuine. Animal lovers will be horrified and rightly so."
4,A compilation of several Fania artists interpreting Ruben Blades' songs.,"This rather unique compilation features such Fania superstars as Cheo Feliciano, Pete ""Conde"" Rodriguez, Ricardo Ray & Bobby Cruz, Tito Puente, Roberto Roena, Ismael Miranda, Hector Lavoe and Bobby Rodriguez interpreting songs written by Ruben Blades for artists other than himself (i.e., Ruben himself personally did not record these songs for release on his own solo LPs). What really makes this CD a worthwhile addition to your Salsa collection is that the spotlight is put on both Ruben's inspired songwriting and on the artists who recorded these songs. This CD's contents undoubtedly prove that Ruben is truly ""El Poeta Del Pueblo"" (""The People's Poet"") and one of Latin music's true icons. Hopefully, Codigo Music Group will remaster and reissue this compilation soon."
4,Toddler-friendly,"This is the second album by Diane Ferlatte that my family has. (Our first was ""Knick Knack Paddy Whack 2."") My 2.5-year-old is enjoying this one, and starting to have his favorites. I love Ms. Ferlatte's work, but I think this album is not quite as polished or elegant as ""KKPW 2."" The songs have good rhythm, and it is nice to hear children accompanying her, but there is not as much variety in style as the second album. However, I can still listen to it over and over, as is required in any toddler pick!Thanks again, Ms. Ferlatte for your wonderful music for children!"
5,quick & easy,"I've used this as a quick, easy read for new employee's to get pumped up about Customer Service. It has also helped to get the staff's creative juices flowing as to how we can apply the ideas in our unique niche market. Great coaching tool along with the other Eric Harvey books."
2,Not that good!,"I had attempted to use this bore sight on my 2 scoped rifles and was quite disappointed. First off the arbors don't fit properly and cause the optic sight to rotate around while aiming in, next and most important is that the grid pattern inside is way off. You can pull the bolt and get a better sight in. Asked for a refund and was given an RMA# but my buddy wanted it so I gave it to him."
1,hobiest,"The .177 insert will not hold the main portion in position. The bore sigt rotates down to the lowest point, making it useless. May work with larger bores but I bought it to sight in a .177 Cal pellet rifle."
2,I really wanted to like this,"I really wanted to like this product. I LOVED the vegetable juices it made while it worked, but the first one I ordered arrived cracked and then the replacement order started cracking after about a week of use. Which then allowed beet and carrot juice to run down and stain the countertop. The juices it made were AMAZING though."
3,it's okay,"lasted a couple months before engine started getting moody and louder than usual.good starter juicer, but if you are juicing up to 2 quarts a day like my hubs & i do, than you'd better make the investment in something more commercial grade. great novice device though!"
2,Parts melted after 6wks,I'm really disappointed that this juicer stopped working after 6 weeks. We use the juicer once per day and today it stopped producing juice. We discovered upon inspection that the piece holding the basket in place has melted. We now have no juice....and no juicer.
5,Big Mouth Juicer crowd pleaser,"I researched reviews of juicers in the lower price bracket. I have had several juicers in the past so I can compare. This rated as the number 2 juicer on Consumer reports. The number 1 was priced at $200 +... I am on a budget and did not want to spend more than $100 on a juicer. I am pleased to say that this juicer works great and I have been able to juice vegetables like Kale and get a decent/good amount of juice. This is my second one as I bought one for a friend and they love it also! For $59 and large amount of juice, mainly dry pulp. I feel this was a great value.."
4,3 years old and still works great!,"Was scared to get a juicer on the cheap end, but this one does just fine. I usually run the pulp through two or three times, by the third time there isn't much moisture left in the scraps. Boil the scraps and strain, ya got a great broth or tea for later. It is important to clean this thing thoroughly after each use if you wan't it to last. Only complaint, sometimes the pulp catcher can slide away from the motor due to vibrations during use, can get messy."
1,even it is not 3 months and it is broken,"There is not too much to say! It is just a juicer and broken in less than 3 months, and there is no way you can return it!!! BAD PRODUCT"
1,Don't bother,"This thing never worked very well from the start. Each time I used it, the vibration grew stronger and the noise grew louder. Finally it started to eat itself and pieces of plastic started shooting out of the little spout where the juice is supposed to flow from. Returned for a refund. Not too upset about it though. These things are kind of a hassle. In the time it takes to prepare your veggies and then clean the machine (immediately necessary) you could have made yourself a nice salad without startling everyone on the block. Besides, with an actual salad, you still get the beneficial fiber that the juicer extracts. I'll stick with fruits and veggies au naturel."
1,Motor quit,This juicer didn't even make it throught the 1st batch. It just died. returned and am looking for one that works.
2,Design Errors,"I thought the reviews were positive, so I got one. BIG MISTAKE!!It is very noisy, so I wear ear plugs when it is on. The huge design error is in the cover. They molded a vent hole above the debris bin. The shavings blow out this hole all over the counter, me and the cabinets!! What on earth were they thinking? Then they provide a cleaning brush for the nooks and crannies. Problem is - it won't fit into the nooks and crannies. I bet a highschool freshman could design a better brush than they did. It would seem they never actually tried out the design before they put it on the shelves - or just didn't care."
1,cheap broken down toy,"The first time I brought this item I was overjoyed it gave me a lot of juice and even though I had to cut the produce and their was a good dealn too clean I was still very happy with it until IT BROKE AFTER ONE YEAR. Like a fool I brought another one b/c maybe I just brought a bad model, well THIS BROKE IN LESS THAN SIX MONTHS. For obvious reasons I will never buy again."
4,Good Product,This is the first juicer I have purchased and so far I am very happy. It has a small foot print and has adequate power for everything I have juiced thus far. Clean-up involves 4-5 pieces and can mostly be done with rinsing in hot water. Consumer Reports rated this a best buy and I agree.
5,Juicer with Power!!!!!!,"Just getting into juicing -- and it is my first one purchased. A friend who is a ""super juicer"" and has five different types said they can't believe how much power this one has for the price. Easy to use and easy to clean!"
5,I can't believe I lucked out with this product!,On a whim I bought this juicer and can't believe that I hit a home run my first time up to bat! I am a juicing maniac with it. No complaints at all. It juices things I never thought could be juiced like little cloves of garlic. I'm drinking cabbage and cucumbers and loving it. Crazy!
2,"Good for weekly juicers, not for ""hardcore"" juicers","Bought this at a store. For the first few weeks, it worked good. It's loud and it's little feet kept falling off but a little glue kept the feet in place and yelling ""JUICING"" got my fiance used to having his shows and/or phone conversations interrupted. Within a few weeks I was digging into the ""pulp"" collector and rejuicing. A few weeks later the juice was leaking all over the counter and the clasps were cracked at the joints. I'm a 120lb 5'5 female who was easy on this...and it crumbled in about 2 months. It's at the dump...I didn't bother with the warranty because I don't want to deal with all of that mess again.If you are a light juicer- may be a good buy. If you are more of a daily/several times a day juicer- don't buy or you'll be back on the market in no time."
1,Broke after 8 weeks of use,"I bought this juicer after spending hours finding a very good juicer for the price. It was a gift for a friend who is very ill. Much to my chigrin, she called today to tell me it stopped running after using for 8 weeks."
3,"Ok, I guess","I've never owned a juicer... so I really have no idea if this machine does what it's supposed to, and does so efficiently. I do know that it takes a lot of fruits & veggies to make a single drink. It seemed to me that this juicer made quick work of pulping the fruits, but hardly any juice came out of them. I felt like the pulp contained more remnant juice than I would have liked.Oh yeah, if you don't eat veggies normally.... don't think juicing them is going to make them any better. The complete lack of texture combined with some really bitter tastes will turn your stomach upside down. And go easy on the ginger my friends."
2,Juicer or blender?,"This Hamilton Beach juicer does produce more ""juice"" from the same amount of vegetables and fruit compared to my old Juiceman juicer. But there is a lot of pulp mixed in with the juice. The filter bowl sits on a circular rim that is raised less than 1/4 inch from the drain bowl. So a lot of the pulp gets into the juice. This juicer might as well be called a blender. Most of pulp sticks to the pulp ejection cover requiring a lot of water to rinse it off. I am very disappointed that the Consumer Reports rated it as a best buy. The rater must not have tried the juice coming out from the juicer."
1,SO MUCH WASTED,I orderd this produt because of the great reviews I read. BIG MISTAKE. You need to put alot of fruits/vegetables in to get one small glass. ALOT OF IT GETS UNUSED. This machine wastes so much. More pulp than juice. Next time I think I am going to by the VITAMIX. I looked at the prices on them and they are very expensive but I guess I will have to save up because I think it is more what I am looking for. I want a blender type where you can throw everthing in and get a whole glass. This way you know the quantity you are putting in is the same you get out!!!
1,DO NOT BUY,I just got this juicer on April 25th and after 2 uses the power switch does not turn on. The manual's only suggestion is to make sure the latches are securely fastened when shut which they were. When I called customer service they told me a replacement machine could take more than 10 business days once they receive the plug from the unit. It's easier to just return to Amazon and buy a better quality product. I'll be putting the money that I paid towards this to the Breville instead.
4,Good it does job even though it is not my favorite,It is a good item but I would not pay mor than 50 dollar for the product.
5,Good beginner Juicer,"There is nothing better at this price point as far as juicers go. This is great and does the job well. There was a little more pulp than I'd like but if you are just starting juicing and don't want to spend several hundred on a top of the line juicer this is the place to start. Also didn't do the greatest with leafy greens, but great with fruit like apples, etc."
3,Pleased,"This is a good product, works great. a little loud but that was expected. overall i would recomend this to my friends and family."
4,hamilton beach big mouth,"My Hamilton Beach Big Mouth juicer was delivered in a timely manner, the vegetable/fruit port was nice and big, and the only complaint is that the juice storage container is small."
5,"Amazing, amazing, amazing.","I just got this juicer yesterday. I was expecting various pieces that I would have to assemble for hours, a small price to pay for fresh juice. But to my surprise, the Hamilton juicer came completely assembled, all I had to do was take it out of the box and put the three pieces together. I didn't even have to use the instruction manual. The motor is incredible, very powerful and produces a lot of juice, even when you put it strawberries and raspberries. The pulp that comes out is dry, meaning that there is maximum juice being extracted. I'm drinking a concord grape, carrot, apple, raspberry, strawberry apple juice right now, and it is better than any juice store I've ever been too, and much cheaper. This is a must!"
5,Juicer,"I check consumers report and picked this juicer. I line the waste basket with plastic bags and then do not have to clean that one part when finished juicing. It works good, then cover, screen, and screen mount must be cleaned right after use. No problems if kept clean. Love to juice."
1,Extremely Loud,"I read many reviews and decided that the many 5-star reviews were sufficient enough to ignore the many 1- and 2-star reviews. I'm returning this. It is extremely loud and because the vent doesn't have a screen to cover it, I'll be scraping kale pulp off of every surface on my kitchen for the foreseeable future."
2,Pooped Out,"I bought this product in April 2012 and as of August 2012 it no longer works. The motor will not turn properly to grind the fruit and veggies. I am very disappointed. Also, it states that you can fit whole fruits in the ""Big Mouth"" and that is untrue. I have had to cut my apples in fours to place them in and I do not buy large apples. You get what you pay for and it's probably better to purchase one of the more expensive well-known juicers out there!"
1,Don't Buy This Juicer!!,"I bought this item in May 2012. My wife and I were using it daily to prepare juice for our baby girls, but on August 2012, the plastic gear attached at the top of the metal motor shaft melted off. The motor shaft still spins, but is no longer attached to the blades, so it does nothing. Save yourself the headache and spend the money up front on a better quality product."
1,From juicer to loser,It worked well first two times of use. Then it just died and it juiced for us no more.
1,What a Shame,"Initially was happy with my new Juice Extractor. Now after only one month of use, it is useless! Where the strainer basket attaches to the base, is made of plastic. It completely melted the plastic on the base attachment and is now useless. Poor design...way to go Hamilton Beach!"
1,Piece of junk,"This Juicer is poorly made and will more than likely stop working within a few weeks of use. We bought one and used it in a normal manner, no hard fruit skin or cores for it to choke on. It lasted about 2 weeks before it just stopped turning on. We sent it back for a replacement, our replacement lasted ONE use! After then sending this one back for yet another replacement we were told that this was the last time we could replace it. The new juicer arrives, brand new out of the box, and does not even turn on the very first time. After re- reading and re-reading the assembly instructions we concluded that we had it perfectly assembled all 3 juicers from the get go.Now we have no juicer and no replacement on the way.The Hamiton Beach Juicer was a waste of time and money. Not only the purchase of the juicer but the shipping backwards and forwards we had to pay for.Do not buy this brand. I wish i could give no stars.I am going to buy a Jack Lalanne."
1,The on/off switch is poorly constructed.,Maybe you will be ok if you buy this in the store. I had mine shipped to me and the on/off switch was laying at the bottom of the box. The unit was well packaged but the on/off switch is way too flimsy. Buyers be very careful. I think I would have been better off buying an older juicer from the good old days when kitchen appliances didn't have mechanisms that look like they belong on children's toys.
5,Was a gift for my mother.,"Gift for my mother. ""I love it"" - Quoted from my mother. Apparently I have to write 8 more words. Thanks."
5,Great juicer,"Easy to use, easy to clean, easy to take apart and put together, good juice. We would buy it again."
4,GTG for me,"I got this juicer because it was rated a ''best buy'' from Comsumers Report,, and it does indeed work well. Easy clean up as well, good unit for the price."
2,Not well made at all,Takes too much fruit to make very little juice. Very Very difficult to clean (especially if you wait too long and the pulp dries). Lid cracked after the third time I used it. I would not recommend it to anyone.
2,Would rather blend...am returning.,"Personally don't like throwing away the fiber/pulp so decided to go with a super-blender I've found. Because of the weight and size, it may be cheaper to keep than return."
1,"Terrible, Leaks all over",Terrible product. Leaks all over and pulp had a ton of juice in it... perhaps i should not have juiced purple/red items to start.
3,Great for Jamba type juice not if you want regular juice,"I have an Orange tree that makes great oranges, the juicer is also great if you are going to drink the juice right away.. But it's more like jamba Juice and not like the orange juice you get at the store.My tree grows about 3 wheel barrows of oranges and I wanted to get something that would juice all of them for orange juice and then freeze it. This doesn't make good frozen juice and i tried a mountain of ways to strain it but in this volume it just didn't work out."
3,Good for the price,"This is a good juicer for the price. It will be good for a first juicer or as a travel juicer. Everything disassembles very easy and clean up is very simple, usually just run hot water over it and its good. It does a pretty good job on harder fruits/vegetables. Not so good on softer ones like oranges and bananas. Basically you get one drop of juice from a whole banana. The pulp from this juicer seems very wet. I think there is alot of wasted juice here. But compared to the price of the high end juicers, this is a good buy."
5,great juicer,"I've never purchased another juicer before, so I cannot compare to other products, but this fits our needs well. It is loud and a bit difficult to clean the filter, but after a few uses you to learn how to work with it. We use it often and have had no problems. The fruits/veggies we've juiced include: apples, grapes, raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, pears, lemons, oranges, celery, carrots, spinach, kale, swiss chard, ginger and cucumbers. The machine has powered through them all. We're very satisfied!"
1,Dead after 3 weeks.,It worked well for the 3 weeks I had it but it is dead now. Flip the switch and nothing. No reset button to be found and adjusting the clamps did nothing. I'm sending it back. I'm going with a Vitamix and strainer bag because I know that won't quite on me. I thought at this price this juicer was a good deal but if it quits after a few weeks it just does not make sense to go this way. At least it was in time to return it.
4,Juicer,"My first experience with a juicer, the machine is well built,it does a great job getting the juice out and is easy to clean up."
1,Not the best,"This was the 2nd juicer that we purchased the first was the Jack Lalane. We decided to go with Hamilton Beach after searching through the reviews. We were disappointed as to how much fruit was being wasted. It didn't extract the juice the way promised. We brought the HB back and purchased the Cuisenart. We were pretty excited to see that the juice did get extracted well. The veggies in the disposal were dry, almost like saw dust. When we used the Hamilton Beach, it was very wet and soggy in the disposal bucket. In my opinion spend a bit more, you will save money in the long run not having to buy as much fruit and veggies."
2,average,"im quite happy with the service ive recieved from seller, however, the product itself is only average and i can tell ill be needing to purchase another juicer within a year... i had never owned a juicer bfore and the research i did didnt inform me the quality i was buying. reviews and ofcourse advertisements said it was quailty but its cheap and in only 5 uses ive noticed a reduction in performance, ie; its become much louder, blades instantly dulled from only carrot juicing, it also shoots the waste out the vent hole, i had to block it off to save washing the wall each time, like i said, with in a year or less ill be buying another and ill probably spend the money this time, dont buy a 'hamilton beach'"
3,"Ok Juicer, could have been more pulp efficient","I had an older & cheaper juicer we bought from walmart, the waste was way drier than from this one. Overall it's very powerfull and ok machine, but not efficient. The pulp is pretty juicy in the waste."
2,Wastes fruit,"I have never had a juicer before and as I'm trying to get more fit thought I'd try one. I don't know if they all do this but for the amount of fruit I put in I got very little juice in return and quite a bit of pulp. Seems to me I'd be better off just eating the fruit itself.Then there's the cleanup. Yes, it comes apart. However, it takes time to take it apart, get rid of the pulp, and clean the items. More work than I want to do."
1,No stars for the Hamilton Beach Big Mouth Pro Juicer,"March 2012: I opened up the box, washed the juicer, plugged it in, dropped in a small piece of zucchini, it juiced. I then put in 1/4 of a very small orange and we heard a huge ""CLUNK"" and the machine stopped working. We tried everything, finally washed it up, repackaged it and sent it back. It worked for maybe one minute!!! This machine is a piece of crap. I have a Kuvings that cost $150 and it's a great machine (I wanted a second juicer for our cabin). Don't waste your money on the Big Mouth....get a decent juicer that will work, will last, and will give you something for your hard earned money. I'd give this juicer ZERO stars if I could.Jackie"
1,Awful,I bught this juicer to mostly juice pomegranates. It made a mess. I had juice all over me and my kitchen backslash and counters.
1,Hamilton Beach Juicer is a Dud,"I ordered this juicer for my mother as a present. The machine did not work right out of the box -- the motor was faulty and did not operate. The good thing is that Amazon.com made it easy to return and get a refund so that I could get her something else. Please remember that you only have 30 days to return. I have sometimes purchased presents months in advance, but I will be leery about doing so in the future for mechanical items."
2,Very disappointed,I purchased this juicer for the love of my life for Christmans as we decided to begin a new chapter in our lives to live and make healthier choices. He used the juicer about 10 times and the darn thing went kerplunk. That being said the customer service department asked that we send the juicer back and they would send a new one. Upon finding out that the juicer was on the blink he had just purchased over $50 of fresh fruit that will now be used for a fruit salad.
4,Hamilton Beach Big Mouth Pro,"I've been using this juicer for about a week. I love the juice! I'm getting used to the process. The only thing I have a problem with is how much pulp doesn't make it into the pulp bin, meaning that cleanup is a rather messy process. It appears that this happens because the fit isn't as tight as it could be. But it's of minor concern. I still give this item 4 out of 5 stars."
2,"Worked well, but didn't produce enough juice","I think as far as far as general construction and functionality the juicer was a good product. However, I ended up returning it because I found it didn't produce enough juice. It almost seems like there should be a gate to allow the material to stay within the centrifuge for a longer period of time in order to extract more juice. The unit produced very little juice in contrast to vegetables and fruits used."
5,Works darn good,It got some power and it's real easy to clean and put back together. It came fast and in tact. I would recommend this as a good first time juicer.
2,Not as amazing as I expected!,"I purchased this juicer hoping to be able to use it in the morning to make my family fresh, live juices from harder veggies that don't pulp well. The major problem I have encountered is that it is so loud that I feel self conscious using it in the morning for fear of waking our neighbors!! The second issue is that you really have to put some elbow grease into it to get carrots, apples and even kale through the machine. I used to have a Breville juicer that gave up the ghost after years of use. It was much more powerful but quieter than this one. I guess as with most things, you get what you pay for. If you are looking for an economy juicer to use mid-day when no one around you is sleeping or trying to relax, then this juicer will work out fine. If you have young kids that have an early wake up call, you might want to spend more and get something a little higher quality."
5,Great juicer!,"This is our first juicer. My wife and I decided to start juicing after she watched the documentary ""Hungry for Change"" I have to say I was skeptical at first but juicing is great. We're trying different combinations with fruit and vegetables. This juicer is very powerful and does a great job, especially for juicing beginners but really I don’t see what more you'd need in a juicer. For the price, it's perfect."
3,"Yes, it makes juice but....","ConsOne of the latches came apart when I was unpacking it but i was too lazy to return or exchange it (too much trouble). I also really hate the fact that its makes more foam than juice, making the juice a bit gross to drink if you don't remove the foam. Also the pulp isn't as dry as I'd like it to be, but it's not soaky wet (mostly).ProsYes, it makes juice. You might have to wait a little for the foam to set and then clear it off the top of the juice but the juicer does what it's supposed to do. It makes juice."
2,sucks,"After only 4 or 5 juicings, it started leaking. Called manufacturer and they would not refund. Don't waste your time and money."
3,good little juicer,"i give this three stars - only for the reason, that I've never used another -and it performs as stated. easy to clean, easy to work - even the kids like this. there is a special cleaning brush for the wire basket...it's basically a smaller dish brush...don't be intimidated ...dishwasher safe, its a good little juicer."
3,Good way to start Juicing,"I bought this juice to start juicing. It is a good entry level juicer. What I like abut this juicer is that you do not have to chop most of your fruits and vegetables. Just put them in the tube and push them through.I am giving this a three star rating because it does not get all the juice. If you want to get all the juice out you are going to have to spend a lot more on a fancier juicer. But don't let a three star ratting fool you, this is a great juicer if you want to give juicing a try or make occasional fresh juices such as carrot or apple juice."
4,Hamilton Beach 67650 juice extractor,"A very good value. Put a plastic shopping bag in the pulp collector to help with clean-up. Best for vegetables such as beets, cucumbers and carrots. Good for greens and firm fruits like apples and pears. Not so good (but it works) for citrus. As a diabetic this machine is great for me. I use it every day.Cleaning takes 5-8 minutes each use."
2,Juicer running out of juice,"I bought this juicer from Amazon less than 2 months ago and used it daily for 8 days when the motor would not engage. Hamilton Beach asked me to cut the plug off the cord and mail that back as proof the machine was not working and within two weeks I had an entire new unit. Instead of making a glass of vegetable juice as needed, I have been making two quarts of juice every other day.After 6 uses in this manner, there seemed to be less juice and more froth and fiber in the juice itself and yesterday, the strainer was full of little bits of black plastic. The juice basket (under the strainer) is abraided and putting itself into the juice. I do not consider this a safe product for average to heavier than average use."
3,Could be better...,"I was really excited when I received this product, but I am disappointed by how much pulp/mess it makes. I guess I should have listened to the reviews but I am a kind of person to find out on my own. Also, the plastic handle broke on the first use - I will probably be returning this product and looking for another one."
4,We are enjoying it!,"It's been great for juicing harder things. We did the blessed herbs cleanse with an older juicer with a very small spout. this one is so nice that you can put in everything whole. We wanted to try pinapple and papaya and those did not get much juice out of them; the pulp was a big wet mush. Overall, very happy for the price!"
1,Great while it worked...,"I'm not going to sugar coat this. This juicer broke the 3rd time we used it. Under very low stress, the motor just burnt out. From the reviews it looks as if these units are hit or miss. If you get one that keeps working, it has the potential to be a nice little juicer."
4,Awesome!,"This is the second juicer I've purchased. I accidentally broke my last one after dropping one of the pieces. I'm writing this review because I absolutely LOVE how much quieter this juicer is compared to my last one. My last one was not Hamilton Beach, and it was EXTREMELY loud. Since I juice in the morning, having such a loud juicer was awful for people trying to sleep. This Hamilton Beach juicer is MUCH MUCH quieter and does a great job! I wish the bin was a bit bigger for the juice, but that's not a deal-breaker. This is a great juicer!!"
3,Leaf vegetables debris escapes during operation,"The juicer is powerful and relatively easy to clean. However, the seal between the top of the machine and the catchall container ,(where the waste goes as you extract) is not hermetic. That creates a problem when juicing leafy greens like kale. The waste escapes the container during operation and splatters all over."
5,Great Machine,"We purchased this machine based on other reviews and are glad we did. We get a great deal of juice from the fruit/vegetables, the pulp is quite dry. I would recommend this machine to anyone interested in a good machine without spending a great deal of money. We have had it for almost 2 months and have had no issues. I only wish it had a larger drink cup as it fills very quickly and you must use another utensil to hold all the juice."
4,Juicer acquired through Amazon,"I never had a juicer of this kind. This one works well, looks nice. The cutter needs a brush to clean it well, and I haven't found the right garbage bags to keep the bin cleaner but it still is a very good product."
5,Love this juicer! Fantastic for the price.,"Love this juicer, and the large opening for fruits and veggies really saves prep time. Be prepared to rinse the screen / cutting surface if juicing a lot at one time. However this thing is tough. I put un-pitted cherries in it once and the juice was awesome. Highly, highly recommend it as a budget alternative to more expensive juicers."
3,Not bad for the price,"After watching juicer infomercials, I did some research on Amazon and found this juicer. I figured I'd give it a try. The pulp from the fruits and veggies seemed quite wet, especially citrus fruits. I got jealous after seeing the demo for another juicer that produced much drier pulp. Hate to waste any precious juice still left in the waste bin. Love the fact that the mouth is nice and wide though. So minus two stars for wet pulp and loud motor."
1,worst juicer ever,"The juicer dont extract the juice, most of the vegetable and fruits are wasted. Also the juicer burned out. the worst juicer ever."
1,"Lless than a week old, already broken",One of the side tie-strap came of aleady. It isnless than a week old. Need to get a replacement already.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,Bought this juicer in May by June it was no longer working. Was able to return it and Hamilton Beach sent a new one. In the meantime I bought another kind.
1,Missing On/Off Switch!,"I was so excited to get my juicer. I unpacked it, washed all the parts and assembled the juicer. Then I cleaned and cut my carrots and apple. I go to turn on the juicer and the there is NO Switch! Advice- make sure you have all the parts before you begin washing the parts and your fruit and veggies."
1,So disappointed,"We were so excited to start ""juicing"". After reviewing many of the positive responses about the Juice Extractor we ordered and were excited that it arrrived last night. My husband put together today, bought lots and lots of fresh organic veggies and fruits to begin our new life this evening. He waited for me to get home to ""juice"". Turned on and...NOTHING. IT does not work. I called the 800 number and was told there hours are 8-4:30, it was 5. Since this can only be ordered on line I'm not hopeful of a quick fix."
2,don't buy,Juicer worked great for 5-6 months and then suddenly it started smoking in the middle of juicing carrots and apple. I took it apart and the center piece that holds the blade gadget just melted. It is irreplaceable and we had to go out and buy another juicer. It just doesn't hold up.
5,As good as you need.,"This Model 67650 is all you need for those who are interested in beginning juicing.You heard about juicing from a friend, saw a movie or documentary, feel like a slugand want to do something about your health but know this new interest may not last.This unit is inexpensive, easy to clean and tough enough for the produce most peoplewant to drink. If you stay in the zone you can always add a diesel powered unit withsurround sound and disc brakes later!"
2,Quits without warning,"I just threw away my second of this juicers. The first one was replaced under the warranty. The replacement machine worked well until today when it wouldn't even switch on no matter which kitchen outlet I used. When they worked, they worked well leaving dry pulp and not too much trouble in cleaning. Noisy, but produced plenty of juice."
3,"Good product, but a few minor problems","The juicer works really well, much as expected and hoped for. The basket is difficult to clean by hand even with the brush provided; have not tried it in the dishwasher yet. A tiny ring on the hinge pin of the clasp handles that lock the basket to the motor broke on the first day; used with care the clasps still work, so it isn't a fatal flaw but it's clearly not robust enough. The basket unit is difficult to release from the motor unit, another small issue. The instructions were clear and complete, and the unit is no more noisy than expected of a juicer. We have run kale, apple, ginger, carrots, and softer items without difficulty.We like the juicer and use it often, but did not expect and should not have had these several tiny problems with an otherwise good product."
3,Disappointed but grateful,"I had been looking for a good juice extractor at a reasonable price. I left it out on my counter and used it sporadically throughout the summer, about a dozen times, then put it away this past month. When I pulled it out to use it again yesterday, the motor wouldn't turn on. I've only had it for 4 months! I could not return it to Amazon since it was past 30 days, so I contacted Hamilton Beach. Luckily, they were willing to replace the unit, but I was told to cut off the power plug, return it to them as proof of its destruction, and to include a $19.99 shipping and handling charge. Because I've only had it since June, they were willing to lower their shipping and handling charge to $10.99. I am very disappointed that the motor was so week, but grateful it will be replaced. I do like this machine. I just hope this unit's weak motor is just a fluke, and that the replacement will last longer."
5,Great juicer!,"Purchased as a gift. Compared to a juicer I recently purchased for $300, this is a great value! It is a workhorse and even when it wears out will be reasonable enough to replace. Easy to wash if you rinse it off immediately. If placed in dishwasher, put plastic parts in upper area of dishwasher."
5,"Great quality, cheap price by comparison","CONS: There really is only one CON that I can see. The part where you put the fruit into the machine says ""fits whole foods"", buuuut when the plastic was formed together to make this portion of the machine they didn't make it into a perfect circle. Its so hard to explain... it is not completely open on the top making it difficult to put whole apples in. Not a big deal to me, but I wanted to share.I do love this juicer! It is so powerful. I would buy it again or as a gift. I watched a ton of various videos on how to use various juicers and this one did just as good as the machine $40-$60 more. =)"
4,It's a Pro...,"This is my first juicer and I'm very happy with it. It's a little noisy, but well worth it when I get the extra energy I need from juicing. Clean-up is easy, especially when you put a plastic grocery bag in the pulp bin before juicing. The picture of the whole apple going down the shute is misleading - it has to be a VERY small apple in order to fit. Overall, I think it's a winner for the price range."
4,Great for a start!,"I bought this juicer to make sure I could commit to the lifestyle change before investing a large amount into the gadget. It works wonderfully. I juice fruits and veggies and have started to create recipes of my own for my family, neighbors and co-workers. Until it breaks, I'll be using it as my primary tool for transitioning to a raw diet. Thanks for providing a reasonably priced juicer for the starter kit, Hamilton!I've recently seen the results of the more expensive juicers and the difference is simply the amount of moisture found in the pulp. There's a little more with the Hamilton."
5,Hamilton Beach 67650,This is not my first juicer and I'm very pleased with this model. The juice is good and the pulp is very dry compared to many others I've had over the years. It's a little painful to cleat but aren't the all... So far it runs smooth and juices easy (no forcing).
4,big mouth juicer hamilton beach,This small appliance was highly rated by a couple of the consumer ratings services. So far it has lived up to its rating has performed admirably and I am totally satisfied not only with the product but with th ease with which the transaction was accomplished
2,Barely lasted a year,"I only used this juicer a handful of times before it broke down. The mess alone was worth investing in a better quality juicer. My return window is now expired of course, but I am going to buy a quality juicer this time. I do not recommend this product."
2,"Fine Juicing, Terrible Mess","This juicer did a good job at juicing carrots and other dry vegetables. For some reason there is a small hole in the top of the lid where the pulp goes, so when you juice harder items like carrots little pieces spray up in the air. I covered the hole with a rag which worked, but I am so disappointed with the mess that I am returning it and buying a more expensive juicer. Also, it is too loud and does a terrible job juicing leafy veggies like spinach and juicier fruits like kiwi."
1,Broke after 4th use,I was really excited to get my juicer. After the 4th time using it it broke on me. I was so sad and devastated!
3,This was a gift...,I bought this a gift for my brother. The reviews were good so I figured for the price this would be a nice juicer for him. He just contacted me that a part on the front has broken off---and he wanted to know if I thought he should return it (he thinks he can just glue the item in place again0. I told him it was his gift---but if he though it would give him more trouble---now is the time to return it. He has had it for about a week and a half.
1,Don't buy!,I bought this juicer about a month ago and the attachments that hold the blade and the motor together are plastic and ended up melting. Needless to say I bought a juicer that I can no longer use and can't return because it's 5 days past the return policy on it. Another side note. At first it didn't have hardly any pulp but after using it a few times it started to create more and more. If your going to juice I'd recommend spending more money on another and not wasting it on this one.
4,It works as designed...,"...and very well, too. The 67650 extractor produces all the juice possible, from whatever fruit you use. I've used carrots, apples, grapes, oranges, peaches, and plums. My purchase was based on the reviews that others had posted. I agree that the cleaning of the sytem takes a good deal of time, and some very detailed work...but that's the only bit of bother. I find the use of a toothbrush cleans out the narrow spaces of the unit. Also, cleaning of the micro mesh strainer is best done, with a toothbrush, from the outside...in. Assembly and disassembly of this system is easy. So far, I'm very pleased with this item."
5,great product for the money,"this my fourth juicer- im over 60- and for the money its great! ive only had it a short time but i love it so far. my last juicers were over 200 dollars and didn't even juice fruit, but that was a while ago."
5,Great product,"This product is great and the price us reasonable. It is easy to use, easy to clean and very efficient type of juicer. This is my first juicer but i think it is comparable to other expensive juicer out there. Highly recommended juicer. Ayos to."
3,Machine is Ok If You Don't Mind Cleaning Up the Mess,"The Big Mouth Juice Extractor does what it's supposed to (extract juice from the pulp). There is a lot of foam produced on top of the juice. So use a spoon to scoop it out your cup before drinking the juice. So it performs well so what is the problem? The thing is I rarely use it. The strainer requires patience to clean. It's like one of those appliances from the 1990's you buy and use a couple of times then it sits around until you give it away. Don't get me wrong, it is a wonderful product provided you like cleaning it thoroughly every day you use it. That gets repetitive though."
3,The juice extractor vs juicing in general,"There are two issues purchasing this product brought up:1) The Juice Extractor- this was my first. It works fairly well. I think it is a good value. One issue is cleanup. The extractor creates a large amount of waste quickly. You must clean the basket frequently if making more than one glass at a time. It takes a while to disassemble and clean after using. Not efficient for a quick morning drink.2) Juicing in general - I had no idea how much waste juicing (at least with this extractor) creates. My first thought was ""no wonder Odwalla's cost so much!"" A large amount of the veggies are not used. If you compost at least you can do something with the unused stuff. The main thing this extractor taught me was why a Vitamix or Blendtec is the way to go (if you can afford it).Conclusion - this is a decent juice extractor, but all extractors waste a great deal of the nutrition and fiber in the fruits and veggies you pay for."
2,Multiply the price by 2 or 3 when considering purchasing,"This juicer works quickly and does a great job. The cleanup is pretty typical for a juicer. You had just better treat it like a newborn baby because it breaks VERY easily and Hamilton Beach refuses sell any individual parts to fix it. So chances are, if you like it, you will be buying at least two or three of them. All they would really need to do is make a few of the most breakable parts available (some of which already appear to be user removable like the plastic latch on the base) and I would be currently singing its praises, but I suppose it's not worth it to them to either make a sturdy, quality product or to let consumers buy some of the most suspect parts."
5,does what it says,"This juicer does everything it says. It is easy to clean. Pulp is very dry-all juice is extracted. It is reasonably priced and I'm glad I didn't spend more money on a higher priced brand. I have only had it for about a month, but use it every day and could not be more pleased with my purchase."
2,Ok while it lasted....a little too loud,My first time juicing and i decided to go with this model cause it seemed to be as powerful and cheaper ($40). The centrifuge spinner started spinning off center after about 2 weeks and burning the rims of the plastic. returned - not happy with this product and it was very loud (i live in an apartment so i have to be very conscious of the noise level).
4,satisfied,"Since i bought this juicer I have used it almost every day. It's easy to use, and probably a good bang for the buck. a strong motor makes sure the gnarliest thing get's juiced, and even the cleaning is relatively easy-(it comes with a brush). I'm happy with it."
2,Wish I'd Made A Better Investment,"I didn't know if I would enjoying juicing, or even be able to swallow any of the recipes. Recommended units were $300 or more. That was just too much for me to spend on a chance - another gizmo that could end up collecting dust in two weeks. I researched for hours and settled on this unit that I felt would be a good combination of value and price. I regret it. I LOVE juicing and will until I die. This is not the unit for that. I've hardly used it more than two dozen times and there's been considerable deterioration in the unit. It's creating more foam, a more gritty juice, and needs more produce that it did when it was new to make the same amount of juice. This is even with immediately cleaning the unit after each use. With this experience, and more research, I can not recommend this juicer or any centrifugal juicer."
3,Good price. But really that good a juicer?,"I bought this juicer based on all the rave reviews. I already have one at home and this is for my offsite condo. I do not find this one any better than off brand juicer, although it does spin faster and seems more powerful. It works great for harder materials such as apples, celery, and carrots. But it is pretty mediocre for soft fruits like grape or mango. The soft flesh flies right off the chute without much extraction.Comparing with my older juice extractor, the Big Mouth mesh basket is smaller, and mesh is finer. In addition, the cutting plate is smaller. I wonder if the combination of these factors reduces the extraction capability for soft-fleshed fruits?"
3,"Good, but not great","The first juicer I received was broken: the nut (or whatever it is) connecting the power switch was not attached (could hear it rattling around in the base), so the machine naturally would not turn on. Fortunately, I was able to get a replacement quickly and my three-star score does not reflect this issue. This juicer got three stars because there is a great deal of solid pulverized matter that makes it into the juiced product. Now, I don't necessarily mind all the time (you know, fiber and all), but this should not be the case. It should be all juice. I'm planning to buy a strainer to run the juice through before drinking it, so I can catch all the excess stuff, but I shouldn't have to do that in order to get the desired results from this product. On the plus side, it juices everything quickly and easily and the cleanup is not nearly as bad as I expected."
2,Not to pelased,"I bought this item and LOVED it ..for about 4 weeks, after that it turned all of the veggies or fruits into puree. This machine is not what I would recommend for heavy duty juicers unless you like the thick goo of puree."
1,Works well at first then motor cant handle it,This juice works great at first but then after 30 times it did not work and the motor blew on it.I would not recommend this and I am going to get a breveille next time.
4,Excellent product,I ordered this juicer on Sunday and it arrived today to my big surprise (free shipping!) I could not wait to use it and got apple juice and carrot juice already. It's a great product and I like it a lot. The cleaning is actually a bit more time consuming (3-4 minutes?) but this is totally worth the price and so great to have fresh juice made at home!
2,it does smoothie not juice,"I brought it a month ago, the service is good. But the product is not doing what I expected. I tried with Apples, Carrots, pears. The juice is thick just like smoothie(not clear at all). the pulp is very wet. I decided to return it."
3,Good product...some concerns,"I have enjoyed this product, the juice is very good and frothy. I have done mostly fruit juice. Even my children like it.It's easy to use, not too hard to clean. A bit noisy. It's not a heavy duty machine but you don't have to cut the fruit up a whole lot to use it either. I'd say it's middle of the line sturdy.After about 1 month of use however, the seal seemed to get loose and juice started to spray out as I used it. Not long after that the machine just stopped working. Amazon was great to work with and promptly replaced my machine. I'm hoping it was a fluke, I've only had the new one for about 1 week."
4,My New Juice Extractor,My husband and I are very pleased with this product. The Juice is very clear. Very easy to clean. Anybody ordering this product would love it.
2,juicer,I love my juicer but on the latches on each side on the first day that I used it a very small ring where the latch latches came off on each side. Therefore it is hanging loose. I do not know how much longer I will be able to latch it like this. I use my juicer every morning and I keep hoping that it keeps latching. Otherwise I will have to return it to you. I paid as much money to you as I would have at the store. I was pretty disappointed. My item is a hamilton beach big mouth juicer.
2,Strong motor... faulty design,"--800 watts is a good, strong motor.--It's louder than the Jack LaLanne machine my friend has.--Has a cheaper plastic feel to it unlike the other stainless steal juicers.--Has a air vent in the top back that spits out some of the rinds (poor engineering).--I returned my to pay another $20 for a better one (maybe the Jack LaLanne being sold at Costco right now).--I could foresee this machine breaking down in the next 6 months."
1,Absolutely Awful,"I suppose I should blame myself for thinking such a cheap juicer would do the job! It was pathetic really. What should have been pulp, was instead large chunks of produce! If you're trying to do anything other than orange juice, you are going to be extremely disappointed. This machine can barely juice greens. One entire leaf of kale gave me about a thimble full of juice! Outrageous, really. Don't waste your money."
4,Hamilton Beach Juicer,So far so good. Filter takes 5-10 min of running water and the given brush to clean. it does a good job and I suspect if anything goes it will be the filter. so will take care of that very carefully.
2,Heard great things,"I heard great things but ours didn't work right out of the box which was frustrating. We decided our money was better spent elsewhere. But they did return it no problem, which was nice :]"
3,Messy,"This is my first juicer purchase and I won't complain too much. I do like juicing, however the clean up is a chore in itself. I use a plastic bag to put in the pulp catcher to cut down on clean up time. The tasking part for me is cleaning the actual filter that cuts up the fruit/veggie. I soak it in scolding hot water and then go clean it but the pulp is still difficult to clean off of it.If anyone has suggestions on how to properly clean this unit, it would be greatly appreciated."
5,Juicer,This is my firsts juicer ever. I was told that the worst thing about a juicer is cleaning it and the second worst thing is to have to cut up fruit and vegetables in small pieces. I went to look for a juicer that is easy to clean and takes big bites and I found the Hamilton Beach Big Mouth juicer. I don't have any comparison since it is my firsst juicer. The pulp is super dry and easy to remove. It came with a tip to put a plastic grocery bag into the large container to catch the pulp. This works great. No mess.I like it so much that I put it on my list to give as Christmas presents.
2,Go with a better quality juicer,"I thought cheapest was best for a juicer, when starting out.Wrong.Go for a better quality product.I ended up with a Breville wide mouth juicer and love it."
1,VERY DISSAPOINTED,"At first, this juicer did a better job than other juicers I've had in the past. It seemed to yeild a good amount of juice from all the fruits and veggies I used. I bought this for $59 -great price. However, both my husband and I started to juice fast. We juiced a few times a day. On the 14th day it broke down completely! I had to go to a local store to buy something new. I bought a masticating one and I love it.Amazon was great when it came to return/ship and refund."
2,Broke in 2 weeks,"I bought this juicer on April 11th and it was broken by April 21st. Used the juicer about once a day in the morning to have juice with breakfast. Juiced only apples, strawberries, bananas, pealed oranges and pineapple chunks. Followed all directions. Made 2 12oz juice drinks every day or so and within 2 weeks of light use the juicer completely stopped working. It won't even turn on. Very disappointed because other than it breaking in two weeks after light use I really liked it. It worked good in the two weeks I had it. It was easy to clean."
4,Works well.....,"I am happy with my power packed HB juicer as I've had it for about a month and use it every morning. I always use a grocery bag in the pulp container and that really cuts down on the cleaning. The only thing that peeves me is the slight leakage you get on the seam between the motor body and the pulp container. I'm experimenting with bag folds on that end to see if I can eliminate it, I'll let you all know when I do. I'm sure that those fancy frenchy brand juicers are better in some way, but I'm not yet prepared to throw down a couple benjis on a juicer. One thing to remember when purchacing one of the many HB Big Mouth Juicers, buy this one, or one with the solid, sturdy, burly metal locking latches, the plastic ones are cheaper but if you read the reviews, they're pretty fragile. Overall, it's a happy juicing experience....oh, and the vendor, DataVision shipped super fast, great service, thanks!"
5,Longevity,"I bought this juicer in May 2009. We used it several times per week every spring and summer. One season I used it daily. That is to say, we have used it quite a lot--150 times perhaps. Now, two full years later, it is showing its first signs of being broken. An electrical burning smell is noticeable after use. Only a 1-year warranty, so we got good use out of it!"
3,"Loud, Loud--did I mention LOUD?","My wife has wanted a juicer forever and I bought her this one for her birthday. She loves juicing, and the machine does an admirable job with just about every piece of produce she's thrown at it (with the exception of spinach).What keeps her from using this machine daily is the noise. The motor is powerful, but loud. So loud in fact, that she can only juice after everyone else is awake for the day, because if not, the noise will wake up everyone in our two-story house. The noise level is so high, that we've already talked about replacing this juicer, even though it is fully functional.The other minor beef we have with it is cleaning the screen. The holes are so fine that it is difficult to get completely clean."
1,No Switch on Juicer,I brought this juicer as it was a cheaper option to other juicers. Unfortunately the juicer was incomplete and had no switch on it. My advice is that you spend a bit more and get your moneys' worth.
1,Why is it taking so long to get here?,"I have my juice book and can't wait to start this way of life. What I don't understand is why it is taking so long to be shipped? Does it come from the interior land mass not yet named? China, maybe? Or is the juice extractor in the process of being put together? I really wanted to start using it yesterday."
3,Juicer,Got prompt delivery on the juicer. Have only used it a few times and it seems ok. I put the vegetables in and the juice comes out so it is working.
1,Not As Envisioned,"I thought I was buying a juicer that would make it easy to have fresh orange juice. However, you must peel the oranges before using this machine. About half the juice is either sent down the drain or on your arms when you peel juice oranges! This seems to negate the purpose of the juicer. Due to arthritis I need something that will squeeze the juice out for me - not something I must squeeze."
5,Excellent valure for money,"Very powerful. easy to use. easy cleanup. all the good reviews are right on target with this product. my best friend has a $300 juicer. I can do everything she can do for less than 1/3 the price. would buy it again.and the seller, beach camera, shipped fedex for no charge and shipped right after I ordered it. great service."
2,"Good for 3 weeks, but then it broke:(","I bought this product because of all the great reviews I read. I initially loved it, but after tree weeks, it just didn't work. I was so sad because I really liked it."
4,Juicing machine,"I wasn't really impressed with this juicer, because it takes a whole bag of carrots just to get one glass to drink. I did made carrot bread out of the pulp that was in the reservoir, and it was delicious! More like carrot cake without the icing, and it was very good for breakfast, dessert, or just a snack, with very little sugar added.So I was more impressed with the pulp possibilities than the juicer, lol!"
5,Great Juicer,"I just finished a 10 day juice cleanse, where I was juicing 4-5 times a day. It's still working perfectly and I've had no problems. It's easy to clean, I love that it comes with a scrubber brush for the strainer, and putting a plastic bag in the pulp catcher was a great suggestion that actually was in the manual and made clean up much easier. No need to spend a ton of money on an expensive one, this one is great and I highly recommend it!"
5,Love this juicer!!,"I am so happy with my purchase of this juicer!! It works great and is actually pretty easy to clean. All of the parts can go in the dishwasher (except for the motor & the screen filter - which requires some scrubbing but cleans easily). For the price, it is absolutely great. I am so glad I didn't waste more money on another juicer because this works so well. Fits large pieces of fruit and veggies into the feed chute, and the waste is very dry so you know you are getting most of the juice out of whatever you are putting in.Bottom line, great juicer & 100% recommend it."
4,not such a big mouth...,"juices like a dream! But the mouth isn't as big as I thought it would be. Medium sized apples must be cut in half. Everything else is great. Carrots go In whole, celery etc. reducing prep time drastically. Worth the purchase"
1,Stay away from Hamilton Beach products!,"Ever since I got the juicer I didn't like it. First the metal hooks felt off (only after using the juicer few times), then another thing broke. And the noise that this machines makes, I feel like I'm on a factory! I tried to make juice when my son was sleeping, big mistake. I will NEVER buy another Hamilton Beach product (I got a H.B. toaster, I'm about to throw it out as well). Spend a little more money, at least it will be worth it!"
5,My new best friend!,"I just love this juicer. I am glad I bought it after reading the reviews here.I am a first timer, but my husband has another brand of juicer and I was afraid to use it because the cleaning of it is so much work. He himself have not used it in years.But I use this juicer every day - twice a day - and it works great and easy to clean. Glad I bought it."
1,Metal-on-plastic flaw,"This Juicer worked great for two months. My 20 year old Juiceman JR still worked, but I was excited about the ""big Mouth"" that could fit entire apples. I really enjoyed this juicer for two months as it saved me from having to slice up apples, beets, and cucumbers, but this morning while juicing I got that ""burning plastic"" smell followed by juicer failure. Upon closer inspection, I noticed the back part of the blade that snaps onto the motor assembly was melted and crumbled. Perhaps metal-on-plastic is not a good way to connect the motor to the blade.I guess it's back to the 20 year old juiceman jr for me."
4,Great juicer - One flaw!,"I bought this juicer based on reviews from this venue. I was very happy with it but after about two weeks I noticed pulp being ejected from the vent port. Initially, I thought I hadn't attached the pulp collector properly but every time I juiced, I realized pulp was still coming through the vent. I was disappointed because this was my second juicer I purchased after sending another one (Omega) back. Ultimately, I just took it down to the local thrift store and gave it to them to sell as my time to return it was over. I've since purchased the Breville juicer and although the cost was pretty high, I feel it was worth every cent...what a great juicer. Don't get me wrong: the Hamilton Beach is a wonderful juicer and very reasonable priced, easy to clean and assemble. If they would correct to pulp ejection problem, it would be a best buy!"
3,Disappointed,"I bought the Hamilton beach less than a year ago and I used it about 4 times a week.It work great for making carrot juice, and other juices. I was quite happy with it until it broke for no reason. I aways made sure to take care of it, and clean it right away. I'm disappointed that it broke so quickly. I thought it was a product with durability. I guess it's not meant to last a long time."
4,Juice Extractor,This product is really easy to use; one switch and your off. I like that it is really easy to clean. No complaints here.
2,should have bought a different juicer.,"The first unit I bought was dead on arrival. Amazon was great about the return. Hamilton Beach though...not so much. They basically point blank said, ""call Amazon, it's their problem."" They didn't attempt to do any sort of trouble shooting or anything. Anyway, 2nd unit worked. I don't like this juicer. Unless you immediately cover what you're juicing w/ the food pusher, little bits of shredded produce erupt out the top. Also, it has this ""vent hole"" in the food catcher unit that literally sprays out food pulp while the thing is running. I'm not exaggerating about this. When I use this unit, I have to clean pulp off of my cabinet doors, the floor and myself. It's no fun w/ carrots but it's horrible w/ fresh beets. It's a stupid design. Next time I'll buy a Braun."
4,Healthy choice,"I am using juicer for the first time, I think I made good choice by buying hamilton beach juicer. So far I found this item doing exactly what it claims to do, the only drawback I found is it leaves a lot of pulp for some fruits which I think eat rather than making a juice, becuase most of the fruit left out as a pulp, which I think not worth but you can always mix it juice and it makes the juice more pulpier.Definitely recommend this product for other people and last but not least you making a healthy choice."
1,Awful: broken after 2 weeks,"When it works it is great. But it broke after just about 2 weeks of usage: the power switch just does not do anything. Yes, I tried looking for burnt fuses and replacing the power cord."
5,Awesome,I so enjoy my juicer...I use it at least once a week and make a large batch but more often I make smaller batches so I use it several times a week.
3,How can I clean this thing?,"This juicer is very sturdy and lasted long. However, it did extract juice only from small pieces. For instance, I could not make it triturate a watermelon's peel. So, what's the use? If I have to cut it into pieces, I'd rather use the blender, which is smaller and easier to clean. Nobody mentions what a hassle it is to clean this thing. You have to dismantle the whole thing, piece by piece, and rub the metal grinder which has blades that at minimum will hurt your hands. I gave it away to my sister-in-law."
4,"Strong and efficient, but hard to clean...","This machine is one powerful juicer! It is very fast, and is so efficient at extracting the juice from just about anything. Although I put in a banana just for fun and nothing came out. Hehe... One negative is that the pulp bin is oddly shaped, making it hard to clean. Also, what do you do with all the pulp? I feel bad throwing it away all the time, and there's only so many cakes and smoothies you can make!"
4,Works well.,"I have enjoyed using this item.But there are a couple of things I wish were different:-I do wish that the pulp was a bit drier.-I also wish that the container the juice flows into were in some way attached to the machine. It's a bit unstable and easily knocked over.I like that I don't have to do much cutting of the fruit and vegetables because of the large opening. It's easy to clean, especially the container the pulp falls into. I took the advice of another reviewer and lined it with a plastic grocery bag to facilitate cleaning.I have recommended this to my sister."
3,so-so,"Hard to review a product that I had never used in the past. Although one thing I know is that it is not supposed to arrive DOA! Took it out of the box got the fruit cut put it in the hopper and nothing! Followed all of the directions called customer service they told me to ship it back and they would replace it with another one. I did and they did. I held my breath but shazaam it worked! You can't beat the value and works ok, there seems to be a lot of pulp though. I put in a five pound bag of apples and came out with an 8oz cup of applejuice, I did not thing that was a fair tradeoff?:)"
2,Hamilton Beach Big Mouth Juicer,"The juicer seems well made and has a powerful motor but it takes an enormous amount of food to produce a little bit of juice because a lot of the fiber, which you want, goes to the pulp holder. So there is right much loss there and I think it's due to the wire mesh basket being very fine. If it were less fine, it would be a really great product but it makes the difference in an ""ok"" product versus a ""great"" product."
4,Juicy Comments,"When tightly assembled it is fast and efficient. Cleaning is slow and painstaking, but I assume this is true with any ""juicer."""
4,Great juicer for the money!,"I know there are a lot of ""high end"" juicers out there, but this one was recommended, and since juicing was new to me, I did not want to invest in a ""big bucks"" item only to find out that maybe it was not for me. I have been extremely happy with this juicer! It works great, it is easy to assemble and easy to clean. I am enjoying trying new recipes (fruit and veggie) and have been having fun experimenting with concoctions of my own! LOVE the fresh taste! I've only had it for a few months, but so far, I am very impressed!"
5,healthy pregnancy,"I purchased this for my niece who was pregnant at the time. She started using it right away. She said she feels like the last two trimesters were the easiest and gives credit to feeling healthier since using this juicer. She said it's very user friendly, and easy to clean up."
2,Liked it until it broke today,"I bought this May 2012 and today it decided to stop working and the motor started smoking and melted. I have only had it for 3 months and I was not using this juicer on a daily basis just a few times a month. Sucks that I can't do anything about this, they should have some type of warranty or something, 3 months seems like a short period for it to break."
5,Legos for health conscious adults!,"The one thing that keeps me from juicing daily is typically the maintenance and clean up of the machine, but the Hamilton Beach Big Mouth Juice Extractor makes it as intuitive and uncomplicated as possible.I love the ease of tearing apart this juicer for speedy clean up and the efficiency and ease of putting it back together. Love all the dishwasher safe components."
3,addicted to juicing,"i have only used this product 4 days but that is enough to get addicted to juicing. i did have a problem with the machine smoking and each time i used it, it got worse. i contacted hamilton beach through email and they immediatly sent me shipping labels to send juicer to them and they will send me a new juicer which i should have in a couple days. other than this problem that i am sure is not usual, the juicer extracts almost all liquid from everything i have juiced leaving very dry pulp(which can be used in cooking,so you get 2 for 1 when you do this) and the juices are very good. cant wait to get my juicer back!"
4,Very pleased,"I bought this from Walmart for $50. I have never juiced before and was extremely happy with this purchase. Very easy to use. I had to chop some things to get them to fit in the mouth, but it's no big deal. I can't think of a drawback; just be sure to soak the pieces like others have said. Cleanup is pretty quick if you do that."
4,Fantastic Value,"Fabtastic value! Did a lot of research on different models at various prices. Decided I would go with an economy model to determine how often I would actually use it first. After 1 year, the juicer is still going strong. It has been used as many as 10 times in a week to as few as 0. I even have been able to juice leafy greens which most reviews would say you need a masticating juicer for. Just wad the spinach or lettuce up nice and tight and put it in with hard veggies."
4,great for the money,I've been juicing for years and I must say for this price it'a unbelievable. It splashes if you're not quick with the stopper but other then that very good
5,Very good product,I have had this unit for six months and have produced a lot of juice. Very impressed with the power and amount of juice I get. Friends have purchased more expensive units and in my opinion this does just as well and often better.
5,I just love it!,"This is my first juicer so I have nothing to compare it to. However, I just love it! It's sturdy, easy to use and clean, and makes great tasting concoctions. I've been having fun trying various fruits and vegetables since I got it a couple of weeks ago. So far, I've loved them all but one (Note to self: A little ginger root goes a LONG way). For the price, this juicer is really a great buy!"
3,Messy!,Good product but a pain to clean! I like it over all but I wish it were not such a pain to use!
2,"Lot o work, little juice","We got this juicer for my mom's christmas gift. She tried it a couple times and was surprised by how much pulp ended up wasted (she likes juice with pulp in it). Some fruits, like blueberries wouldn't even go through, just came out in the pulp. She also didn't like how difficult it was to clean, and since she wants to use it more than once a day, it got to be a hassle.It was returned and she is much happier with a high functioning blender/food processor for her needs.Amazon was very helpful on the return and made the experience a bit better for it."
2,Big mouth juice extractor by hamilton beach,"Hard to get apart, juice catcher to small, VERY messy to clean and operate. Not good for single person. It does make juice but it's and major undertaking"
1,ON/OFF Switch wasn't even fully put together.,"I received this product on time, but it appeared as if the juicer's on/off switch had never been fully assembled. The switch was lying on the bottom of the box and the piece to keep it on was no where to be found. Obviously I didn't get to use it so I can't really rate the product's abilities."
2,Motor broke after 3 weeks of use,"This juicer worked good at first, but broke and was completely unusable after three weeks of normal use. I peeled oranges and limes. I always cut fruit into smaller pieces and was careful never to force anything into it. The electric motor in this particular juicer is very weak, and wears out quickly. It's a cheap made in china pos. I juiced daily with it and like I said, I took care never to overload it and it still wore out."
1,the worst juice extractor,"this juicer just las 3 months, I have been looking for a good juice machine but this one its just wasted money ."
1,Hamilton Beach Big Mouth Juice Extractor 67650,"The machine was working great for about 3 weeks then one of the handles broke. Only one person used machine and it just broke so easy. I am no longer pleased with this product, I feel like I wasted my money."
4,I like it alot.,"I love this juicer, i wish i had started juicing years ago, The only reason i didnt give it 5 stars, my best friend has a Brevall and its the best it seen, but i didnt have $350 to spend at the time. But this one is good for the price!!"
4,My buddy!,"Even half asleep, this juicer is easy to operate and pretty easy to clean, too. The only thing I can say against it, is it's a little loud, but I haven't heard others so I don't know if it's midrange or what. I do know that it's a little quieter than my blender and that's good. All in all I'm very pleased with it. The big opening means at most I may have to halve large apples or pears, but otherwise it's drop and go and it's very fast. I use it about 3 days a week and the best part is I'm getting fruits and vegetables that I usually don't have enough of, especially during winter."
4,Hamilton Beach Juicer,"The opening is very big. When you place the vegies in there, they jerk and shake around when it hits the juicing blade. I found that if you put more vegies in the opening, for example, instead of one carrot at a time, put in four, so it fills the opening, this will minimize this jerking or bouncing around of the vegies. otherwise, it is pretty nice. It juices well, easy to disassemble to clean."
3,Unhappy,"I liked the product when I received it. I have used it about half a dozen times and the washer on the arm has come off. Now I have to see how I can return it for a replacement. Each time, I carefully took it apart to clean it, but the washer popped off the last time I used it. This part of the construction is certainly not very good if it comes apart like this."
5,Juicer,"The juicer was everything that it claimed to be. Easy to use, easy to clean, and it makes great juice. I feel healthier already."
5,fantastic,Came to me fast and works great! Came in great condition too. I love using it every day. It's easy to use and fun. I couldn't be happier.
4,"Good Quality Product, Great Price","I received this product very quickly- and it has worked just as I'd hoped. Good quality construction, easy to take apart and wash.I am satisfied with my purchase."
4,Hamilton Beach 67650 Juicer,"Does a good job in juicing. It takes a lot of vegetables to make a little juice, so I use Kale which is pretty cheap. Cleanup is a chore, there are many parts to clean."
2,Broken Blender,"I used the blender one time and the locking handle fell apart. It was a manufacturing defect. Amazon made the return very easy and refunded all cost including shipping. I am pleased with Amazon, but do not recommend the blender because handle will fail sooner or later due to way it is attached."
2,Not carrots or apples,"This is the fourth juicer I have used. All have been the same type of centrifugal juicer. I have had this only two days. I have tried to juice carrots four times. The residue comes out just like mashed potatoes, with very little juice produced. The centrifugal strainer/grater holes fill with fiber and prevent it working properly. I have twice cleaned the strainer and put the pulp back through again. I still get substandard amount of juice. I just borrowed a Juiceman for two weeks and was fairly well pleased but worried about the number of people who said the top cover had broken. I am returning this juicer and going to get the Jack Lalanne to try from Costco."
4,"juice, juice and more juice",I love my juice and love fresh juice even more. This appliance makes me want to get a job back in Dallas and move back into my house so I can put a garden in my back yard and have fresh veggies to make juice from!
4,Great,"I love this juicer! I use it every morning. I'm new to juicing but this juicer has worked great so far. Cleaning is easy besides the metal grate, but it comes with a brush that helps a lot."
5,Awesome Juicer,After reading the reviews I chose this product. It does exactly what it is suppose to do. Great juicer for a beginner such as myself. My brother and I love this juicer!
5,"great juicer ,good price","I like this juicer,works great ,the price is right too ,no problems so far .I have been using this juicer twice a day for about a month."
4,"Good, couple of place to nitpick","This was my first juicer purchase. I really like the power of the machine and the fact that 90% of the pulp is dry - not sawdust but you'd be hard pressed to squeeze any moisture out of it.That being said there are two caveats:The vent hole over the pulp basket allows pulp to come out of the basket - make sure you loosely cover that if you see pulp on your counter top. Not a biggie but it can make juicing a bit messier that intended.Occasionally I'll end up with the last piece of whatever I'm juicing in the pulp basket whole and unjuiced. I'm probably doing something wrong, like not applying the correct pressure but it's a bit annoying.Other than these two I'm very pleased."
4,Very good juicer - after I repaired the switch,"Juicer came ahead of schedule. Unpacked and noticed small metal piece in bottom of box. Turned out to be the lever from the on/off switch. Bought a new switch, as I did not want to go through the trouble of repacking and sending back. Once I replaced the switch, tried out the juicer and worked great. I have used this machine several times now and is still holding up very well. Pulp is relatively dry and juicer extracts very well from any fruit or vegatible I throw at it, even leafy greens (which I fold up tight before putting in the chute). Would have been 5 stars except issue with switch."
4,good juicer,"I had been looking at juicers for about the last 6-8 months and just couldn't decide! Then someone told me about the Hamilton juicer, we read the reviews, and we purchased it.The VERY first day we made the best apple and lemon recipe from the manual. We had macintosh apples and it was just like homemade cider! We've tried all kinds of things - here are some favorites:1 pear with 1 cucumber1 papaya with 2 orangescarrots and celerycranberry & grapefruitveggie - carrot, celery, spinach, tomato (just like v8!)Only things that don't juice well that we have found so far is broccoli & banana. the broccoli florets go everywhere and there is very little juice, and the banana just gets mushed and no real juice.Good value for the money, there is a warranty, and its really easy to clean. Suggest putting a plastic bag in the receptacle so there is one less thing to clean. Also, used carrot and apple remains to make a cake :) Very tasty and felt good to not throw it out."
2,"Good price, but doesn't do a good job.","I have been juicing for decades, and bought this juicer for what appeared to be good construction and price - both of which are true. The problem is that it doesn't do a good job.The main tasks of a good juicer are:1- to extract the juice from the pulp - it gets only a 3 out of 5 there. The pulp is generally wet, and contains about 10% to 20% additional juice.2- to keep the pulp out of the juice - it gets a 1 out of 5 there. Somehow the pulp spills over the top lid into the juice cup. I stopped using it because of this problem.Although I wish I had never bought this juicer, I give it the average score of 2 just to be fair."
2,Broke after 4 months,"The juicer worked fine for about four months and then it stopped working. I used it regularly, 3-4 times per week on average, and cleaned it well after every use. I can't recommend a product that has the potential to break the way this juicer has."
1,Shame on Hamilton Beach,"I have had my juicer for less than 60 days and it has already been sent to the curb. After less than 2 months of super frothy juice (Not exactly what I was hoping for) it started smoking and some of the plastic melted. I contacted Amazon and was told to call Hamilton Beach. Once I got them on the phone, they let me know that I was past the warranty date by 7 days for a free replace and free return. Now I must pay a noter $15 for shipping if I want this product replaced. But the only way they will do this is if I send them a picture of my faulty product. They advised me to cut the cord in half and send the pic via e-mail. Horrible customer service. Stay clear of this one. I was hoping for good results, but unfortunately, was disappointed with this product."
4,Great Value,This is my first adventure into juicing so I didn't want to spend a lot. I am very happy with this product. I juice greens (kale and spinach) daily and sometimes I have to run the pulp through again but am experimenting with ways to bunch a lot of greens packed tightly into the chute so that you then use the plunger and push it slowly to extract more juice. As long as you rinse everything right away the clean-up is a breeze. I have not found that I need a plasic bag in the pulp container. I dump it into my compost bin then rinse it out with the spray from my faucet and it's not a big deal.
4,Intro to critical thinking and feminism for young adults,"Great way to get young people thinking about contemporary issues of double standards toward women; great basic conversation-starting book about critical thinking, protesting, and the costs associated with taking a stand. Although this was simple reading (grade 6-9), the issues are compelling even for a much older audience. I have never read a book that covers these issues with this amount of balance and finesse; incredibly thought-provoking. This would make for some fantastic classroom discussions with teenagers."
4,Where are the Maya?,"Coe has presented us with an excellent survey of the cultures and languages of Mexico. However, he has excluded the Maya from this study. I find this disturbing because, as Coe points out on p. 61, the oldest people in Mexico were those we have come to call the Olmecs. We don't know who they were, what language they spoke, or where they came from. But we have hints. Nahual (Aztec)poems speak of a lgendary land called Tamoanchan which existed before the Nahuatl speakers came to Mexica. Tamoanchan is not a Nahuatl word. It is Mayan and it means 'Land of Rain or Mist.' This indicates that the Maya were ancestral to both the Olmecs and to all pre-Columbian Mexican culture. They deserve more than a brief two paragraphs in this work."
5,An Outstanding Introduction to this Unique and Highly Effective Weapon.,"The karambit can be defined as a small hand-held, curved fixed blade for personal-defense. ~ In ""Karambit: Exotic Weapon of the Indonesian Archipelago"" Steve Tarani gives us an outstanding introduction to this unique and highly effective weapon.The book begins with a very interesting introduction and history, followed by three sections teaching use of the karambit:> Part 1 - Basic Handling and Operation> Part 2 - Combat Strategy and Intermediate Skills> Part 3 - Advanced ApplicationEach section is well illustrated with numerous photographs demonstrating use of the karambit. Although no book will make you a master of any weapon, you can certainly build a good foundation in the use of the karambit by learning the skills demonstrated herein. I highly recommend Steve Tarani's ""Karambit: Exotic Weapon of the Indonesian Archipelago"" for anyone interested in adding a new skill to their martial arts knowledge."
2,"You have to be a big fan, to find all of this interesting.","I had never seen this show before. The first show was amusing, but the second one wasn't all that interesting. I was about to throw my VHS copy away! - it's nothing I would give as a gift, and I don't want to see it again. (If you pay the postage, you can have my copy for free - my e-mail is philip1@post3.tele.dk.)"
1,How about a discription?,"It would be nice if there were a description of the product. Without size and number of packs, how could I be expected to buy?"
1,Disappointment,I wore these earrings several times and enjoyed them. The crystal has a hole in it with a metal ring. I was unclipping it and the crystal broke. When I looked at the return policy it said I had missed the availability of returning them by 4 days. Wow. Awful.
2,Cheap looking,These earrings are cheap looking and not worth the price. The crystals are mostly flat and do not capture the light well. Perhaps the faceted crystals would be more what I was looking for.
5,These earrings made a great gift.,"I bought these earrings as a gift for a young friend. She loved them. They look exactly the same in person as they do in the picture, very shiny and sparkly! They were shipped in a nice gift box that made wrapping a snap."
5,Swaroski earrings,The earrings appear to be of good quality. The crystals are clear and bright. They arrived in good condition.
4,"Catchy Beat, great sound....","""Be That Way"" is a great song. Emily has a great voice and the song is extremely catchy. I found myself putting my CD player on repeat and listening to it over and over. Everyone says its overplayed but I don't agree, it has a great new catchy beat. The only problem with this CD is that ""Be That Way"" is the only song on it. I am hopeful she will record a full album soon."
5,Congratulations Emily!,"If you have followed the story of Emily on Jeff and Jer's showgram in San Diego, Ca. on Star 100.7, you should feel so proud of Emily. The song is a GREAT song! She has all the talent of Christina and Britney put together. Universal Records was very wise to sign Emily. San Diego is proud of her too! The song demonstrates the youthful and soulful sound of Emily. She will go along way. The single is well worth the [money]. This CD should be the first of many for Emily. Congratulations to Emily, Jeff and Jer, and San Diego for making dreams come true. BUY THE CD!"
1,Don't be that way...,"Oy, this is horrible. She wants to be the next Spears or Christina but she isn't even as good as Mandy Moore or Jessica Simpson. She has a long way to go before I will pay for her music.She may or not be ready a few years from now. But, don't expect me to pay for her tuition.Stay away from this record..."
2,You decide,"I first heard of Emily in San Diego. That is partially why I dont like her. I cannot stand Jeff and Jer, the two DJ's who first played her song, and here is why. First, the song is not that good. The problem with todays music, is that we are a society that lacks musical talent. N'Sync, christina, Brittany, they all play to the teenage girl crowd, but thos tastes change. I have no problem with the success they are having, and I wish everyone could experiebce that success once in their life, but the fact that I am subjected to it on the radio is horrible. The music is poor. Back to Jeff and Jer, anyone who tells a survivor member that wacthing them on TV was one of the best things to happen to them during their lives... Well, enough said."
3,Nice song - good start,"I have follow the phenomenon that is Emily since she dropped off her demo at HiStar (KFMB-FM, 100.7) in San Diego. While this is obviously a commercially polished version, I liked the demo version better. I expect to be hearing a lot more from Emily. She is a real nice girl and deserves this chance at grabbing the brass ring."
1,Terrible - Overhyped,"This song was overplayed on one station just to get listeners to ""vote"" by clicking on a website. The station promoted the idea that this person would be a star because a few people ""voted"" for her. However, one person could sit and click all day long and each click counted as a vote. All of this manufactured hype got her CD single produced but there NEVER WERE millions of people voting for her as the station proclaims. A select few did so. This is just another Britney/Christina/Jessica wanna-be with little talent. She sings off key frequently, and nothing is unique about her or the music. Waste of time and money."
3,M - L - E!,"I think Emily has a great sound and she's a very hard worker from what I've heard about her.If I'm not mistaken, Emily attended school at Poway High School (my alma mater) and a lot of great people have come out of that school: Stephanie Seymour, Blink-182, basketball star Jud Buechler (hope I spelled that right!) and Miss America 1985, Kellye Cash - just to name a few.""Be That Way"" is not bad for a first effort."
2,Getting Better,When I first heard this song her voice was off at some points. She does have a pretty look and catchy song with the new remix. I wish her Luck and hope she continues to grow in her music hey everyone has to start somewhere. Star 100.7 and The people of San Diego have helped you get that foot in the door now its Emily's turn to jump in that door the rest of the way. Good luck and don't let anybody elses bad comments hold you down let them help become stronger and prove them wrongRJ
5,Great Book-,"I bought this book for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day..I figured he'd get some good use out of it, but I had no idea he would really get so much out of this book. He read the book and picked out the areas he wanted to work on, and set himself up with a routine that he does, and since he knows that these particular moves are aiding his surfing ability and endurance, he had no trouble at all sticking to them! If you're already a body builder, this book is no good for you. It's more for the person who exercises regularly, but didn't really have a form and routine to follow to make the most of it, and get the most out of it. Makes a great gift for a surfer who needs a little more endurance, or it just starting out, or one who just needs something to keep them in surf shape during those cold winter months, or those poor surf days!"
2,i didn't like it,"hate to say it, but i wish i read my review before i shelled out the $ for this book -- seems to me that rocky is jumping on the ""surfing explosion"" bandwagon. the book did not help me. i did not find anything useful. everything seemed awfully obvious to me. oh well."
4,"ballard at the height of his powers, comes together in the end","ballard had an odd sense of pace and tempo in telling a story, and after you've become accustomed to him at the height of his powers it's easy to forget that in earlier works this weird ballardian notion of time and place could make the story wooden and tedious as it began to unfold.something strange is happening in the jungle. some questionable characters with checkered pasts find themselves in the middle of it. some people have some sex (the sex isn't quite strange and violent enough--ballard is still young and perhaps reserved). the military is involved.like, rest assured, everything comes together and it's creepy and disturbing; but if i were not already enamored of ballard from super-cannes, cocaine nights, atrocity exhibition, &c; i'm not completely sure i would have trusted him enough to tough out the early parts of crystal world."
2,Lonley Planet Yucatan 2nd Ed,"We are big fans of the first edition of this guide - and were anxious for the new version to become available - since many places in the Yucatan are changing vbery quickly.The 2nd edition is a major disappointment as instead of new information, it just looks like any out-of-date information was removed - nothing new added. This is especially disappointing since Playa del Carmen, and Tulum - two areas that were well written and useful in the earlier edition, are changing so much.I recommend getting the first edition if you can - it is much more comprehensive.This is the first Lonley Planet Guide we have even been disappointed with. I hope a new and better edition will come soon."
3,Not so great,this guide leaves out a lot of things. You need more detailed info abhout getting around and where to eat and stuff. I think it's pretty outdated too. they pay too much attention on Cancun and less on the rest of the Riviera.
5,Get Out of the Way Joe!,"Get out of the way Joe, Nancy is here. This book has to be one of the best. In this book, Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys act like pros. That is untill Joe let's his personal feelings in the way. He actually hated Nancy!!! Read this book to see what I'm talking about. I recommend this book to anybody who loves a good mystery."
3,Great sword and sorcery!,"This book really caught my attention. Set in the fantasy world of The Sundered Realm, the story concerns itself with the adventures of Fost Longstrider, a hard living warrior who makes a living as a courier and Princess Moriana Etuul, heir to the throne of the magical City in the Sky. Fost rescues princess finds a bottle is the dispossessed soul of a former conservative wizard turned hedonistic liberal, after all 1000 years in a bottle will do that to any sane conservative. Fost is hired to protect the princess and obtain the jewel of great magical power. The Princess has an evil sister who's taken her throne and she wants revenge, adventure ensues. The description of the sky city, zepplins and balloons powered by fire elementals, and other mythic overtones made this a memorable book. I'd like to get the whole series in one big book. If you liked the Conan novels, this has the same pulp gritty feel. With a humorous dispossessed wizard in a bottle for comic relief."
3,Radio Interview,"This is a recording of a one hour radio interview of Maya Angelou by Michael Toms. For the most part, Toms asks predictable, softball questions. Fortunately, Angelou is a gifted speaker who loves to expand on topics and tell stories. Highlights of this interview are Angelou's description of her journey from muteness to speech, and her meeting with Malcolm X in Ghana just after his pilgrimage to Mecca. The tape doesn't have many surprises, nor does it go into any great detail about Angelou's accomplishments or philosophy. Nevertheless, listening to it may provide a pleasing past time to her fans. Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of the tape is the fact that it allows the listener to hear Angelou's voice and her unique blend of Southern African American accent over-layed with the classical sounds of educated American women of the 1940s, mixed with vocal souvenirs from far-away lands and peoples."
2,NO STRUTTIN HERE,"I first saw this movie about five or six years ago and my two cats were enthralled with it...one of the few they even paid attention to. Alas and alack, those two pets are long gone, but my wife and I have three cats now so we thought, what the heck...maybe these three will enjoy it as much as our previous two. WRONG!!! They could have cared less..and that about sums up the movie. If you can't get cats involved, how can humans enjoy it? To be fair, STRAYS isn't gag your mouth bad, but it's so inane and inept, it's hard to be frightened. Shame on Kathleen Quinlan for giving such a horrible performance; shame on Timothy Busfield for not retiring; and shame on Claudia Christian for playing such a shallow character with little if any venom. Shame on the cats for overacting; shame on Shaun Cassidy for writing such a non-frightening movie. Shame on me for trying to subject my cats to it!!!"
5,Suspenseful yet laugh-out-loud funny,"If you're a fan of that good ol' tried and true ""When Animals Attack"" genre, you will looooove this one! I was just channel-surfing one day when I happened upon this gem. I'll sum it up in 3 words: THE MICROWAVE SCENE. Simply priceless. (hahaha)"
1,LOL bad kitty,I saw this when I was younger on USA back when they put cheesy horror movies on like this.I am ashamed to say that it scared me years ago.That was probably back when I was actually SCARED of idiotic movies like this one lolFlash forward many many years later as an adult.Ive read the reviews here and remember bits and pieces of this movie and all I can say is wtf was I thinking being scared of these adorable little cats? LMAO .I'm a major animal lover and love cats especially so this movie makes me want to watch it again just to see the horrible and hilarious acting and the cute as a button kitties :)Only one thing going for this movie: cute cats. :)
3,a good first novel,"Some of the writing is a bit awkward, but the story moves flawlessly. Nothing like an exciting ending to a book. A good first effort by Seattle writer, Rob West."
4,Excellent!,"I loved this book. Wonderful sub plots. Rich characters. A good mix of dark humor and drama. There's not much I can put into words.Want to know anthing more?If so,read it yourself."
5,A Good Buy,"I recently purchased the Dora the Explorer backpack with the detachable lunch bag for my 4yr old daughter and she absolutely loves it, the large velcro straps allow her to attach and detach the lunch bag on her own which gives her a sense ofdependency. The bag is also very colorful as well as durable, and durable is always good when it comes to kids."
5,Dora backpack with detachable lunch bag,"My five-year old daughter was very excited to receive her backpack and an extra incentive was the detachable lunch bag which was a hit with my daughter. She also liked the visual stars on the bag and she continues to count the stars on a daily basis. The lunch bag was great and she look forward to eating all of her lunch as well as filling her lunch bag up for the next day. My daughter is a devout fan of Dora the Explorer. The backpack is durable and does not show any wear at this time, we purchased the backpack a month ago. It handles well! I would recommend this for Dora the Explorer fans."
3,Acceptable for the price,"It's a cute backpack with one large storage pocket and detactable, matching lunch box. The lunch box is small (we use it to hold a change of clothes since she doesn't take a lunch to school) and I wish the bag had another small pocket to store things for preschool. The bag probably won't last too long--the material seems pretty cheap. However, it IS Dora and my Dora-loving daughter uses it for school three days a week. It works for that, so I find this backpack acceptable."
4,Dora the Explorer Backpack,My daughter loves this and the lunch box that attaches makes her feel independent
4,Handy Backpack,"I purchased this backpack for my four year old daughter who was going to preschool for the first time.I was concerned that she would not remember to bring her lunch box home at the end of the day so this backpack is fabulous because the lunch box attaches right to the backpack. It is also helpful to me because at a glance I am assured I remembered to pack her lunch!The Velcro allows my daughter to attach or remove her lunch box herself which is a definite plus for her independent personality. ""Look momma, I can do it mine own self!"""
1,More Banality from an expert,"Joe Falls not only doesn't know the difference between a slider and curve, he doesn't know the difference between a prostitute and an undercover cop. Joe was picked up for soliciting in the 1970s, but since he bleeds University of Michigan Maize and Blue, that fact gets overlooked when inducting him into various writing hall of fames. The only thing this book maybe useful for is to line the bottom of a birdcage."
5,It's working on my bettas,"I have 19 bettas. They were all fine until I stupidly bought some Java Moss and gave each one some in their tanks. The Java Moss introduced all kinds of crud and I was going crazy using this and that product with limited results. The last straw was when my beautiful, satiny white over half moon male, Snowman, and females, Zsa Zsa & Fifi, fins started to curl! My beautiful royal blue fins, Rothmoor, were all ready devistated as was my cute little red female, Annie. I hesitated to use this because of the cancer warning on the back of the label. But I needed the big guns. So I started using this and I'm seeing progress after 2 days. I'll continue the treatment according to the product label and I'm purchasing some more here on Amazon 'cause it's hard to find in the pet stores."
5,"""Cracking"" is wonderful","A comprehensive primer for software, internet, and e-commerce entrepreneurs. If you're new to the business, you'll find every chapter chock-full of critical information. And even if you're a ""pro,"" you'll be amazed at how much you learn."
4,"Works well, and it's ""green,"" get it?","This product works really well for my small lawn. I used to use a competitor's 16"" and this is a major improvement. Lighter weight, more accurate cutting. Adjusts from 1/2"" to 2 3/4"" with two hand tightened wingnuts. I switched to manual when I heard that a power lawnmower had the same exhaust as eleven cars. (Even if the stats are exaggerated - and they're pretty hard to fathom - it's still substantial.) Manual is no big deal really. And they're a lot quieter! Um, I guess that's obvious. Assembly is about ten minutes and not too challenging for those who can eat cereal with a spoon. I added the grass catcher which is kind of a POS, but works passably. There is a sharpener which you may want to get, too. Mow your lawn while saving the world - how can you lose?"
3,'Tis ok...,"I was initially disappointed when I opened the box because parts were rusted and in assembly, 2 holes were askew. After a little fabrication on my part I was able to complete the put together process, but it took extra half hour to make it all work. As soon as I used the mower though, I was delightfully surprised and impressed with it's workability and cutting prowess. I soon got over the hassle of having to drill proper holes and cleaning away most of the rust. This would have gotten a better than ok rating if it had arrived in a better condition.Great States 815-18 18-Inch Deluxe Push Reel Lawn Mower"
3,Push Reel Lawn Mover,Its a nice product but even the smallest stick abruptly stops the mowing action. It cuts pretty but you do have to go over the space a couple of times for a great cut. I've had this product now for about 2 years and the rubber over the handle has peeled and cracked and is about to fall off.Would I buy it again probably not but its sufficient for the small lawn I have.
1,Disappointed....,"Lots of good reviews for this mower, sadly, this isn't one of them. It was easy to put together out of the box, as advertised, no complaints there. However, from the first time I used it, it cut unevenly. The left side cut lower than the right side and after using it for four months the mower began to squeek with the unmistakable sound of metal rubbing on metal. Shortly thereafter it became almost impossible to push, even over concrete. So sick of this thing I just threw it in the trash."
2,Good for... Exercise,"I like the idea of environmentally friendly lawnmowing. However, in using this lawnmower, that idea clashes with my idea of properly cut grass. This model proves that there is no effective replacement (yet) for the good old gas powered mower. Having said these negative things, I can attest to the great workout you'll get after spending an hour alone with this model and your lawn."
5,So far so good.,"So far this mower works as well as could be expected. With thicker, deeper grass, sometimes I have to make two passes (in varying directions) to get the grass to my expectations. But, I also did that with the gas mower I had before this one. Overall, I would recommend this product without hesitation. Happy mowing!"
2,A real workout unless you have grass that isn't tough,"My lawn is made up of bermuda grass. In the winter I overseed it with rye grass. The mower works fine on the rye grass. But when it comes to the bermuda, the mower just can't handle it. I would have to push hard, and then mow about 2 feet of lawn. Then back up and get a few feet further. Took a couple of hours to mow the lawn that takes me about ten minutes with the gas mower that I now use. After about a year the bearings wore out. Made a cracking sound as I mowed and made it much more difficult to push. If you have a lawn that's made of rye or fescue this will probably be ok. But even then I doubt the bearings will last more than 2 or 3 years. If you're going to get a push mower invest in something better."
4,Good Mower for Smaller Yards,"I bought this mower because our yard is pretty small and it was much more ""green"" than a gas mower. This mower is great if you are able to keep up with weekly yard work. Unfortunately I have trouble getting out there every week so go out every other week at most. I find that I have to use my weedeater/edger because of this as this mower has difficulty on longer grass.The clippings catcher that it comes with is pretty inadequate and I have yet to find a bag that fits it.Make sure you know what you're getting into with a push mower. If you're convinced you want one then I would definitely recommend this one."
3,Doesn't cut any weeds. Misses too much for me.,"The mower arrived on time, in good packaging. One of the mower arms had a light dusting of surface rust on its surface. Not a big deal, it would take 15 years to rust all the way through and I cleaned it up fine. The problem with the mower is that it doesn't cut any thin little weed chutes which for whatever reason I always have sprouting. It cut the standard grass great. Functioned great, spun smoothly, and cut evenly. The only problem is that it won't cut my weed sprouts so if I used this I would have to go back over my yard with a weed eater, or snips and recut the thin weeds. This mower would be excellent if you have a yard that is weed treated, or you never get a weed in your yard. But if you get weeds randomly (like my yard) this won't work the best for you. I hope this made sense."
3,Didn't cut everything...,"Thought this would be a great, eco-friendly way to mow our tiny lawn. Am really disappointed. We would mow back and forth over the same area three or four times, and this mower would leave long hairs in the grass- most of it would be mowed neatly, but there were lots of taller pieces of grass sticking up. After trying for three weeks in a row, we gave up and sent it back. Our lawn looked like it had been chewed on. Maybe we just got a defective one?"
5,Worth Every Penny,"Really gets the job done without all the noise,expense or storage issues of a gas mower.After using a push reel I don't think I'll be going back to a gas mower."
3,Great idea but bulky,"Great green mower, but a little too big for my little lawn area. Wished I had gotten the 14 inches instead. Can't reach the grass areas near the wall, so still stuck with my electric trimmer. I usually have to run over the same grassy areas a couple of times to get the desired height. The handle is a little weak for themassive blade/cutter part. I hope it will last more than a year. Over all it's an ok product, with an ok high price."
4,Real reel mower,"This is a great mower, quick assembly, smooth cutting. My only complaint: I thought it was made in USA and found out it was made in China! Wish vendor would have said so in the product info."
5,"Easy, quiet and very nice cut!","This is a first time purchase of a push reel mower and we are very happy with it. It pushes very easy, and is lighter than a motorized mower. We can mow very early or late without being a nuisance. We did get it late in the season and while it does a great job of cutting an overly long lawn ( and even spots that have never been mowed this year!) it does leave the long very thick stemmed weeds. If the lawn had been kept up on regularly it does a wonderful job, we are really thrilled with this."
5,Childhood Nostalgia,My great grandmother had this book and it was my favorite read as a child. I was able to share her copy with my son until my aunt's children were able to enjoy it. I am going to buy another copy for our family as the one they have is rather worn and may not make it much longer.
4,"Not garden gnomes, but pretty close","I don't know what the connection between garden gnomes and Vliet's gnomes is, but it is close enough to satisfy a garden gnome enthusiast. The moving parts in this book entranced me as a youth, and they are still pretty fun for me today. The author is a great illustrator. If this book looks at all interesting to you, you won't be disappointed in it, I guarantee."
4,Eel Skin Size,"I have to say that I did think that this item was going to be a little larger than it actually was but the quality was just what I was looking for. I was very impressed with the customer service at the Belt Outlet...so, I ordered the larger ones and sent the smaller coin purses back...they were wonderful to work with and I will order from them again. Really nice to know that customer satisfaction is important to this company."
3,looks cheap,I bought this as a gift for someone. It has a think feel and a cheap flimsy look and feel. I would not buy it again.
3,Goodbye Mr. Chips,"Goodbye Mr. Chips is pretty much a book about the life of an old and loved schoolteacher. Mr. Chipping (Mr. Chips) is a schoolteacher at Brookfield, a boys school. He reminisces about random events throughout his teaching experiences; different students, his wife dying, conflict with headmasters, and so on. He finally dies one evening after his retirement and an encounter with a new student. The book is a feel-good sort, but it is so random and skips throughout, so it is hard to be kept interested. There really isn't a specific plot because of this, so it is difficult to realize the point."
3,"Literary, but not a thriller","Chuck Logan is a very skillful author. His ability to describe the environment of northern Minnesota is, like the weather there, breath taking. However, I hesitate to call this a thriller. There are roughly three ""scenes"" in the novel that are thrilling, which leaves a lot that is not. I found myself doing a bit of skimming to get by the overly-detailed discriptions of meals, barn contents and medical procedures. Three star rating. So-so."
2,"Great start, but slows to a crawl . . .","The first 80 pages (paperback) are top-rate, fast-paced action. Then it slows to a crawl while Logan tries to develop his characters. This is NOT a ""page turner"". Take your time, and you'll be matching the pace of this book. It picks up again about page 300 or so.And the action descriptions in the coldest night in Minnesota history is not as dramatic as I expected. Other reviewers hype this book too highly. It's ""okay"", but no match for James Patterson or Alastair McLean."
2,DOA,"All I can really tell you about this book (audiobook version) is that I couldn't get beyond the first tape. It seemed to be winding up to very predictable events: jealousies, intense sexual impulses, an almost comotose and paralyzed patient who, you know eventually, is going to tell all by blinking his eyes or wiggling a finger, in the meantime enduring savage behavior at the hands of his wife's former lover.My own prejudice is ""move the plot along."" If the author can do it with good characterization that's even better, but most mystery genre characters are pretty flat. So is this book."
1,Really Absolute Zero,"I find it amazing that the title of this book also serves as an apt description of it's value. Unless of course you're turned on by mindlessly crude language. If the number of ""f"" words were removed from the book, it would be 100 pages shorter."
3,3.5 Stars,"This was my first Chuck Logan book, and I could sense that I was missing out on a lot of background story. I really liked how the book started out so fast-paced and intense, and kept it up for about the first 100 pages. And overall, I found the plot to be interesting and enjoyable, and the characters relatively interesting and well-rounded. I guess my only confusion was the relative lack of any moral barometer in the main character, Phil Broker. We are told he has a wife and young daughter, but then he spends much of the book pretty much going back and forth between 2 other women. I definitely felt like I was missing something that might explain his behavior. Including ostriches in the plot was interesting. And being from the Mpls./St. Paul area, it was kinda fun to actually know some of the towns/roads/areas he mentions in the book."
5,First Logan novel.,"This is my frst Chuck Logan novel and I have to say it will not be my last! Starting with a very exciting camping / canoe trip to supposed murder, this haunted ex-cop with a world of problems of his own goes on to win out in the very cold Minnasota winter. Good story telling!"
4,Very good thriller....,"This was my first Chuck Logan book and I enjoyed it very much. The novel begins with a thrill-a-minute canoe/camping trip and continues on back in Ely with a very interesting story and cast of characters. The ending also is action packed. I gave it four stars instead of five because I felt the action bogged down in the middle a bit, but this is a very good thriller, well written and well worth reading. I will read his other novels."
2,Surprisingly lackluster,"This album is definitely a new sound for Roena. Unfortunately I don't think this new sound went well for him since it really sounds generic and nothing really stands out in this album. The only track I found good was ""Hablame Mi Amor"", which was still does not have a remotely equal effect as ""Tu Loco Loco"" or ""Avisale a Mi Contrario."" This is one Roena album I would skip. Only good reason to buy would be to complete a collection."
3,"It was OK, but...","Digital books are super handy, but maybe not for this textbook. The real book isn't very big, but this one has page numbers in the thousands (muliple ""pages"" per page), which made it difficult to track where you were, especially when real page numbers are referenced in class. Also, the textbook doesn't really give good descriptions on how to do things - you have to depend on the graphics, which were also not very good. I tried expanding them, which would have been an awesome feature had the graphics been higher quality, but the graphics were of such poor quality that expanding them just made them blurry. That's a big disadvantage. I don't mind some digital textbooks, but this is definitely is not one of them. Should have bought the real thing."
3,Lied to me,"My book was alot more damaged than they explained. They told me the book was ""like new"" but when I received my book it look like the book had been used for years..."
4,Good Basic Database Book,This is a good basic Database book to teach the basics of everything you need to know.
4,Database,"This book is very interesting, but I believe it could have been written a little better for understanding. But the picture and guidance gives it a five star because even if you do not understand the book. The pictures will help you understand what they are looking for in the examples and homework assignments."
4,sets you a good foundation,this book will teach you the real concept of database.. chapter one is really important! Good luck!
4,Provides a good overview of database design/management,I have used this book for the past 3 years in an undergraduate database design course. The book addresses the major issues associated with database design without obscuring topics with a lot of the underlying math/relational algebra details. The book serves well as a backdrop for the course material. Its use of MS Access for examples works well for the typical database designer/user. 'Hardcore' database students/professors/developers would probably want a more detailed treatment of the subject.
3,"Good book, miserable Kindle edition","The book is fairly decent and to the point about management of databases, but the Kindle version of this book has such impossible to read low-res images of the database tables that it can get infuriatingly frustrating at times."
3,Excellent for database concepts ...But!,"As an online student (last quarter), I found this book to be helpful learning about databases and their operation. However sometimes due to the examples, it is difficult to follow the writer's thoughts. Also it would have been very helpful if the book contained a copy of the database that is used in the examples, so that I could try out the examples. Or at least offer the database online from the publisher!"
3,"Not his best, but it's still Sr. Betancourt...","This release definitely does not compare to Justo's prior output This was his last release for Fania...done fairly late in his career. It's certainly not anything of the caliber that came before it, but there are surely far worse releases out there by others. A ""lesser-quality"" release by Justo is still better than some ""best"" releases by others. So, that it mind, it's definitely something you should pick up and put in your catalogue, especially if you're a Justo completist. Good stuff all around in this release, just don't over-expect and you'll be happy.This release also features Sonny Bravo on piano, along with Adalberto Santiago."
4,manic silliness in the comedic style of Airplane and Police Squad,a fast-paced wacky comedy--a real tour-de-force from Mark Blankfield--lots of hits as well as a few misses but you will laugh out loud even if you don't want to admit it....second opinion...it was okay. kinda lame tho. a lot of cheap jokes but it was pretty funny.
4,ABOUT FRIGGIN TIME!!!!,"Absolutely one of the BEST comedies to come from that wonderful 80s decade. ABOUT FRIGGIN TIME this one got released on DVD. For those who are unfamiliar with this movie, think comedy in the slapstick tradition of ""Airplane"" and ""Naked Gun."" Before there was ""Harold and Kumar"" there was ""Jekyll & Hyde..Together Again!"" Definately worth the price and time to enjoy some side-splitting, original humor. Other favorites to compare this title with: ""Night Shift"" ""Party Animal"" both also great films to add to any comedy collection. ENJOY!!!"
5,Still as funny as ever!!,I laugh as hard and as loud I did when I watched this in the movie theater. Rauchy and racy from start to the finish.
4,Jekyll and Hyde Together Again,"Mark Blanklfeild oft seen in Mel Brookes features is at his comic best in this modern version of Robert Louis Stevenson's famous novel Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.Dr.Jekyll(Blankfeild) is a world famous surgeon under supervision of a greedy Hospital Director. Who would stop at nothing even denying his daughters hand in marrige to achieve his goal of the first total body transplant. This to be performed on none other than Billionaire Hubert Howes. Jekyll however has decided to retire from surgeries only to devote his life to better living through chemistry. Leading only to mishaps that procede in making Dr. Jekyll become the sexstarved Disco maniac Mr. Hyde.Classic eighties comedy from a left over disco era of Angel flight slacks, platform high heels, Flared collared shirts and lots of gold jewelry."
4,Pretty good!,"I did like this film very much as a kid, though my girlfriend wasn't too thrilled, she endured every minute along side me. It was great!"
1,completely ruins the jekll and hyde storyline in every aspect.,"when i watched this movie, i knew it was going to be a ""comedy"" spinnoff of the Dr. jeykll and mr. hyde of sorts. but come on...jekll as a ""junky""... really? anyway. there were some funny parts, but the rest of the movie see-sawed between ""good enough movie"" to ""bad 60's drug snortfest"". i don't reccomend getting this movie."
5,Still cracks me up!,Just got my copy in the mail and I can't believe that I am still spouting lines word for word. This movie is so classic. Don't sleep on this one...
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!,I was so happy to find this movie on DVD! I lost my Mom's one-and-only VHS copy about 20 years ago and she never forgot it. She kept hounding me and hounding me until I found it on Amazon. So glad to have my relationship with my Mom restored!
2,Jekyll and Hyde,"This movie, while extremely funny in some parts, is also incredibly tasteless. It is not for everyone, but if you're into the absurd, this one is for you."
2,Heckle the Jekyll,"I thought I remembered this movie as being funny when I was very young, but I was clearly mistaken. It's my opinion that the humor is dated, and I was quite bored with it all."
3,a bit campy but still fun,"Another oldie but it has Cassandra Peterson (aka Elvira, Mistress of the Dark) in it, so it can't be all bad. They made it campy for fun and that's what it is---FUN. Enjoy."
2,OK if you are into Nick,"Scene It games are fun, but not one always picked for family enjoyment. Games like this are too focused on knowledge gained by watching specific TV shows."
1,Do not buy this if your a nick fan of the 90s,"i bought this because i grew up on nick in the 90's. and i was looking forward to it greatly because most of my friends were nick fans of the 90's. but when i received it i was so annoyed it just focuses on current nick stuff and a couple of semi old ones. but leaves out so many shows that i remember fondly.this is only interested in current kids and ignores veteran fans who remember salute your shorts,pete and pete,are you afraid of the dark,secret world of alex mac,guts and the list goes on and on.im gonna try my best to get my money back on this cause this is bull."
5,kid game,that they were glad to have since they were not old enough to play our Scene it. Hours of fun and enjoyable to watch them play!
4,it's her favourite,"This book teaches about different emotions, you can also talk with your child about details of the pictures and the gestures that characterize specific emotion. The size of the book is also convenient - you can carry it in the pocket and use it whenever necessary. I wish the illustrations were a little better."
3,One Song - That's It,"This is a demo single. The song is on 1,000 Fires. Only difference is that this song is about 3 minutes and the 1,000 Fires album song is 7 minutes. If I were you I wouldn't by this album for the song, but for collection value."
4,Interesting and Entertaining,"Ed Morris, in this self-published work, offers a detailed 2-mile jaunt around Newport's famed Cliff Walk and surrounding neighborhood. Along the way, he links Newport and some of her better known summer residents to one of American history's most dramatic and interesting eras. Morris introduces his readers to the architectural, industrial, and socially ambitious giants of turn of the century America as he shares tales of their Newport-styled approach to the ""strenuous business of leisure."" This book is chock-full of anecdotes that share Morris' unique insights with locals and visitors alike."
3,"The band sounds good, but the vocals are weak.","Since I have enjoyed Blackfoot for many years, I gave NDN a listen. All the songs are well written. The band sounds pretty good, much like Blackfoot. The only weak point I can hear is the lead vocals. Still, for the most part, buying the CD is not a bad buy. I just hope Blackfoot puts out some more music soon.Ricky Medlocke is touring with Lynyrd Skynyrd right now,so it might be some time before we all can enjoy new Blackfoot tunes."
1,Really Bad,"This movie might have been funny back in the early to mid-90s when this type of humor was common. This movie seemed to compete with the Wayne's World films, Chris Farley films, and other SNL inspired characters and rolls. This movie weighs heavily on both the physical humor and verbal humor from the actors. Paulie Shore has some funny lines but not his best work. An honest effort but the movie falls short of any real chemistry in humor, acting, and screenplay writing. If you have nothing better to do, you could always watch this."
1,Insulting.,The thought that western civilization could produce such garbage in the 20th century completely baffles me.
3,"The Movie is Funny, and they finally dropped the price","This is one of Pauly Shore's better movies. Makes me think of something Sandler would do well at too. The movie finds Shore struggling for a place to live let alone his personal problems. When the chance to extend a court case that looks open and shut comes available he fillerbusters the jury into keeping the case going. His antics will make you laugh. Not all is fun and games and what is important wins in the end.Only one problem here was it was not worth more than ten dollars on DVD. Well they finally lowered the price, and I plan to get a copy. Certainly worth this price. If you enjoy Adam Sandler, David Spade, or Will Ferell you will probably like this movie."
3,Not as good as Son in law,This movie is a good one to add to your collection of Mr Shore's movies i only wish he made more
2,Pauly Shore = a shame to the acting community!,"Man, this was bad, I mean bad! The movie had the potential to be a vry good comedy, had the protagonist been anyone othen than the obnoxious, untalented, the big ex-MTV guy called Payly Shore.There are some funny jokes in the script, but most of them are ruined when they are in the mouth of the lousy performance by Shore. The guy seems to be moking the audience, it's hard to describe.Anyway, the movie is not a total loss, there are good ideas and a solid supporting cast."
1,Pauley is a 5 But the Movie's a 1,"I agree with the previous reviewer that this is a terrible movie but thats where the agreement ends because I I disagre with him that Pauley Shore is a shame to the acting community! I really like Pauley Shore and think he has made some darn funny movies and he was very good in them especially Encino Man, Biodome and son in Law. What I didn't like about Jury Duty wasn't Pauley Shore, I thought he was good but it was what he had to work with that wasn't good like a terrible script and humor that just wasn't very humorous so the 1 star is for the movie but Pauley Shore himself would get a 5!"

1,Disappointed.,"OK I don't mind a dumb comedy once in awhile, Dumb and Dumber, The Mask, and Billy Madison were dumb but they were funny but I was disappointed with Jury Duty I just didn't find it funny at all! I had bought this tape from a video store because it was a previously viewed tape they were selling for a really inexpensive price and since I did enjoy another Pauley Shore movie I decided to buy the previously viewed Jury Duty tape but when I watched it I was very disappointed, I was so bored and barely made it to the end! I gave the tape away to a relative who liked the movie so it wasn't a total waste of money!"
3,great early 70's Hard Rock,"Another nearly-lost proto metal Hard Rock gem from the 70's.Album starts off with a wild cover of the Stones ""satisfaction"" that takes a left turn into fuzz jam land.Pretty cool.Rest of the disc is pretty consistantly cool,blues-based hard rock with some shreddin' guitar work.Why only three stars? Led Zep/Sabbath/Cream this aint: add another star,though,if obscure 70's hard rock is your musical obsession......"
4,Ya got a few extra bucks..?,"This is quite a dark little album. If you consider 3 stars to be interesting and 4 to be good (5 is a must-have?)...I'd give 3.5 stars. The sound is not always clean, and yet it's obviously been afforded a lot of development and several songs are quite creative. The first track, Piety, is my favorite. There are also one or two good instrumentals later in the CD. And if you like ""Piety"" on track 1, check out Abscess's song ""Dead Days"" (can't remember album name offhand)."
4,"this is also called ""Arthur's Reading"" I believe","Although they have different covers, this CD-rom seems to be ""Arthur's Reading"" also, exact same."
4,JUST BOUGHT IT FOR $89,"Don't pay too much. I've seen this grill up to $299. I paid $89 and it is well worth the money. Big cooking surface, very flexible heat adjustments... could have a better grate, but otherwise a nice grill."
1,Freezes Beginners Out,"This program is set to freeze the screen if the new typist is unable to pass the test for intermediate level. This has caused great frustration for our kids. The program needs to be rebooted each time. I only found the solution to this by going to the Broderbund website. Broberbund seems to think rebooting is a simple solution for beginners. I find this program difficult for left handed typist. It gives the intermediate test immediately after the lesson for the ,and. These are two difficult skills for left handers. It also freezes in other places and then does not restart where I left off. This is just a poorly written program."
4,Pleased with Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing 12.0 Deluxe,"Though the product targets a younger user/student,I found the exercizes worthwhile. 12.0 Dlx wasvaluable help for me to increase my speed and accuracywhich will enable me to increase my salary.High recommendation for the rusty who don't need muchto get back into the swing of typing. The ergonomicexercises are a considerate touch.Amazon delivered when they promised, as always. :)"
2,useless,"I found this book to be practically useless. I don't know if it was the translation or poor editing, but it is awkwardly written and organized. It never quite gets around to explaining how to achieve a deep trance state. I know that information on this subject can be subtle but this is just a lot of silly useless nonsense."
5,Eel skin flip fold - burgundy,"Let me start by saying I have been looking off and on for 10 years for this wallet. Years ago, I was visiting Seattle and found a similar wallet at a shopping center down by the water. I loved it, best wallet I ever owned, soft, strong and attractive. However, a few years later, my dog also fell in love with it, and ate it. Saw this, price was right and tried it. Excellent... just like I remembered, quality product, lots of places for cards. May order another one ( I have a new dog)."
3,Eel Skin Wallet,"The flip fold ID wallet was out of stock, so I had to change my order because I could not wait (needed birthday gift in time). I got the regular bifold instead. The material was nice, soft. The color was a bit more red than burgundy. However, the item was not delivered promptly. I called after receiving the out of stock notice and changed my order. I had requested express delivery and specifically requested that they still mail the new wallet express. After a week I did not receive the wallet. I called and they had not mailed it. However, they promptly mailed it at that time and reimbursed me for all delivery fees."
4,"Nice wallet, unusual leather, and the price is right, fast shipping too!","I'm very pleased with the eel skin flip fold wallet. It's light and thin, and I like the three extra credit cards slots on the back of the ID flap. The leather seems to be very thin and is softening up nicely. It's well made and stitched. Time will tell how well the eel skin leather wears.The shipping was reasonable, and very fast. The wallets arrived in only three days."
2,Nice parts - dreadful instructions,"The parts in the box make this set look like it would be fun if you could figure out what the instructions mean. The book that comes with the set is written in English and yet the instructions consists solely of microscopic pictures that lack essential information such as how to attach the elastic string to whatever you are supposed to attach it to. So far, two of us have managed to make only one of the described projects work despite a couple of very frustrating hours with the instructions and a magnifying glass."
1,Don't waste your time with this kit,"I find that this so called ""physics"" kit is nothing more than a bunch of rip-off pieces that look exactly like over-sized legos, with ridiculously small instructions. I had to do some of the experiments in this as a grade in school, and as a twelve year old who has played with legos all my life, I still had trouble building these projects. To say that it is challenging is a huge understatement-I spent 3 hours on the wind-up car pictured on the cover, yet it still didn't work. The majority of this time was spent trying to interpret the directions (which were as helpful as having none). I could have probably built the car better if I had built it according to the picture. And to top it off, it had a pitiful two paragraphs on potential energy, which barely even skimmed the surface. ANYONE could have told you the information stated in the booklet. My advice: If you're looking for a kit for your child that is educational and fun, this is not it."
2,Great concept poor instructions,"I have a degree in physics and I struggled kelping my kids with this kit. It's a great kit from a physics education standpoint BUT there are some ridiculous inconsistencies. Most of the parts are durable plastic, but then there are some paper parts that are impossible to assemble as directed. The paper propeller required for the first experiment? Forget it. Instructions are poor for a design that will not work. I tossed that and adopted a plastic propeller from our K'NEX kit. Not optimal, but better than that stupid paper one. The instructions for the machine assembly are minimal at best. If you buy this kit, be prepared to wing it. And assemble it ahead of time so you know how to do it before you work with the kids."
4,A Blast From My Past,"I am a girl and I grew up with a brother who is 4 years older than me, and he played the drums. I remember him playing these songs from this very ""album"" as we called them back then. He is now 62 and Iam 58. To be able to download and share this with him is priceless. Thank you AMAZON for having these ""oldies"" available. It seems like only yesterday I heard these tunes being played in the basement !!Jane Vann Johnstown, Pa."
3,Too much pop,"Too much pop, but the real songs are good. Weed through the crap to get to what's good about the band."
5,Blue Ribbon Candies,"I had this book before, and somehow lost it. I have been looking for another one for at least 15 or more years. I am thrilled to have it back again. I paid 10 times it's original price, but was willing to do so, happily. That is how much I think it is the best candy cook book I have ever had, and I have a cook book collection that is about six hundred."
4,A Character All Its Own,"Being that the film ""The Quiet Man"" takes place exclusively in the country of Ireland, the score needed to reflect the musical heritage of that country and does so in a remarkable fashion.Though not the original soundtrack to the film, this re-recording still offers up many of the little ditties that viewers of the film are constantly humming upon finishing the viewing process. Whether it be the beautifully orchestrated opening and end titles, or the very dramatic build-up the ""The Big Fight"", this CD will have you recalling the film all over again.About the only things missing from this collection are the various drinking songs that strains can be heard from throughout the film, but otherwise it is the closest you will ever get to re-creating that original viewing experience."
5,A Great Classic,This is a film that I have watched over and over for years. I have begun making it my St. Patrick's Day tradition to watch it along with Darby O'Gill and the Little People now that I no longer go out drinking. It is beautifully filmed in a beautiful countryside. It is a good representation of the Irish during the period. All of the actors are pretty fantastic in it and I enjoy it every time I watch it.
5,Couldn't Believe I Found It,"I had always thought this was one of those soundtracks that would never see the light of day to be put on CD. After hunting it down a few times to find it out of stock or not avalible, Amazon finally offered it. I love ""celtic"" and I love this movie, it's little wonder why I had to buy it. They should release more soundtracks like this one - fabulous cd!"
2,Remake lacks the great vocals,This is one of my favorite movies of all time. This is a remake and none of the original vocals are on this which does nothing for me. Can not buy this after hearing it. Where is the original?
1,the quiet man,"So nice to see at least a bit of Young's original score replicated. But with a terribly small orchestra and of course minus those amazing Crosby vocals from the original release on Decca. This is a nice tribute to the original recording-but the orchestra is tiny, the arrangements might be original but sound so puny compared to the original on Decca original. But more important--knowing that this is a release by a small indie--this release misses those great vocals by Crosby which made the initial 10 inch vinyl amazing. Still all in all-an attempt at replicating the original Young score. . .but with an orchestra that numbers half of the original soundtrack's expansive sound. Think the Brave One done by a 22 piece orchestra. Buy at will. I might add that the sound is flat."
4,Good Start,This is the first adoption book I have read and it is covering all the questions I have had so far. A good book to start with.
5,Great place to start,"As a newly adoptive parent, I look back on our adoption journey, and this book was where we first started. Because the volume of adoption information available can be overwhelming, this book covers the basics and will help to introduce you to adoption and guide you in an adoption process that is right for you."
2,Not what I expected,"I'm extremely disappointed in this tea. I'm giving it two stars instead of one to account for the indisputable fact that my dislike of it is a matter of taste (as any food review would be).I find it extremely perfumed with bergamot (a citrus-like sweetness) with very little black tea flavor. If you are looking for a straight ahead great tea to drink in the British style with cream and sugar, this is certainly not it. It's sort of a dessert tea for those who perhaps don't enjoy the flavor of strong black tea mixed with cream.I can't believe I have 120 tea bags to drink of this stuff. How will I ever get through it?"
5,Excellent Tea!,"We had tried this tea before in Europe, but could not find it easily in stores here. It has a distinct, flavorful, pleasant taste--it actually tastes like ""real"" tea, even though it is decaffeinated. The price was better than we found anywhere else. We're very thankful and are enjoying it very much!"
5,Heaven in a cup,"You can't get a more satisfying, soothing decaf than this. I can't drink caffeine within 6-8 hours of bedtime, but with this tea, I can be totally satisfied and sleep like a baby. Great flavor!"
1,Terrible,"Wow, beyond terrible. By FAR the worst video I've ever seen. If you can't read tabs and/or have never heard ZZ Top then you should buy this. It is just the major riffs taught in a very annoying way. Almost no lead work. I didn't see any section with amp settings or any setup stuff. It seems very amatuer but the guy is sitting in front of $20,000 of gear. Terrible though."
1,These were a FAIL,"These pills did absolutely nothing for me, and I even doubled and tripled the dosage. Still no results, I wouldn't recomend this at all."
2,What you pay for is what you get.,"I totally agree with you hun, and I guess you're a coffee drinker. That's why. The effects of the tablet are there, but it's very mild. I don't drink coffee very often btw; I need energy from time to time and I want to ditch those sugary energy drinks.Anyways, what you pay for is what you get. I tried the guarana from Natrol and I have to say it's the real deal. I had purchase the Natrol before buying the Super Guarana because I thought the Super G was bigger and cheaper. But I was wrong, you get what you pay for. hahaNatrol - Guarana, 200 mg, 90 capsules"
4,It's okay but not perfect.,"I don't take 2 tabs in one drinking. I have to split it 6 hour difference in a day. It's 1200mg and I think it's strong enough. I've tried a different brand (Solaray); it's only 400mg (I take 2 tabs in one drinking) but it keeps me active throughout the day but like any other caffeine-based supplements (coffee, chocolates, and tea included), there's a crash. I have to sleep 1 hour to continue the rest of the day."
4,works for me!,"I first met this in drinks in South America. The lift of caffeine without the calories in a can of Coke. It works for me. Effects of one tablet lasts about 6 hours, without being hyper and without a crash. Just lots of energy to get things done. Haven't tried it late in the day. Coffee/caffeine tends to keep me awake and guarana may too. For me, the latest I have taken it is about 4pm and it's worn off by bedtime. Since this is a large dose I only ever take 1 at a time and I don't take them every day. But they are great for a day when you want to get a lot of things done... you just keep on going and going and going!"
4,Guarana 1200mg made by Good n Natural is a great product,I really like this product I have a busy life like most of us do and I don't want to drink a cup of coffee everytime I feel tired and taking one guauana tab in the middle of the day does not make me feel jittery.
2,Very poor production quality; cheesy script; good workout,"The workout was good, but except for the call-outs the sound was muddy and unclear, amateur quality at best. This makes the video difficult to follow. Regarding the cheese factor, although I expected the connection between the yoga and sex to be contrived, the video went too far over the top--especially when the instructor winks at the camera at the end of the video. This type of thing is very annoying after the first viewing. Finally, the instructor, who is beautiful, has good form, and gives clear directions, flaunts herself unnecessarily, and this detracts from the overall sex appeal of the video. Subtlety and understatement would have been much more powerful and provocative."
1,Utter trash,"If I could have given it zero stars, I would have. A complete botch of adapting of an excellent novel to film. The major plot line of intermural skullduggery between British spy agencies was dumped rendering Anthony Hopkins excellent performance inexplicable. Add in the worst counter-culture nonsense idyll on film since the pointless Death Valley ramble in Antonioni's ""Zabriski Point"". The horror... The horror..."
4,The Looking Glass War,"The movie was a little lacking for a spy movie. Itneeded more of a story line. But, Christopher Joneswas worth watching, He's a ""Fine"" actor, andstill gets movie offers, but he seems more into beingan Artist now. He sells his work, and you can buy hisprints, I have bought a few. They are Great!!"
1,Boring travesty of Le Carre's work.,I love Le Carre and was looking forward to this film. But what a mess! The plot is a mishmash -- after about an hour I no longer cared what might happen to the protagonists. Excellent actors like Ralph Richardson and Anthony Hopkins are wasted in secondary roles. Other reviewers say that this movie was edited to death and I believe it. Save your money. Maybe they'll release Spy Who Came In From The Cold on DVD some day.
4,Good Spy Movie which captures the zeitgeist,"There are a number of technical and plot flaws with this story, and John le Carre clearly learned from them since they did not occur again in his later works. Seeing Anthony Hopkins act in this movie shows the potential which of course he has achieved in many roles since then."
2,Mediocre adaptation of Le Carre,"The Looking Glass War is a mediocre adaptation of John Le Carre's novel of the same name. The acting is stilted and awkward, the screenplay poor, and the whole thing feels contrived, which it is. Even Anthony Hopkins' performance is poor. Bought it, watched it, put it up on eBay.If you are looking for John Le Carre stories that have successfully made the jump from print to the silver screen, you want:The Spy Who Came In From The Cold - Richard Burton is stunning in his portrayal of a burned-out spy.Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy - The BBC series starring Alec Guiness. I made the mistake of starting this one evening around 9 PM planning to watch two chapters and go to bed. I finally got to bed at 2:30 AM, having watched the entire thing.Smiley's People - The BBC series sequel, as it were, to Tinker Tailor. Equally mesmerizing.All-in-all, I am of the opinion that only the British can successfully translate Le Carre to the silver screen. Hollywood just doesn't get it."
5,Cold War performance from Christopher Jones,"This is an excellent cold war film competently acted, well scripted and neatly directed. It is a superb adaptation of John Le Carré's best-selling novel. Paranoia runs rampant here. Christopher Jones is brilliant as the civilian turned spy. Christopher Jones should have gone on to greater things. His pinnacle as an actor came in David Lean's epic ""RYAN'S DAUGHTER."" Anthony Hopkins and Ralph Richardson are also featured."
3,Good Spy Flick,"Just finished watching The Looking Glass War. I had never heard of this movie but I am a big fan of John LeCarre and his books and movies. This movie is definitely up to par with the others though I put Tinker Tailer Soldier Spy at the top of any realistic or true spy/espionage movie with The Russia House at the bottom of the list.This movie stars Anthony Hopkins and a very young Christopher Jones. It is very much a LeCarre movie and is not about the action, though it has some. It is slow of pace at times but not in a bad way. It is more of a character study than a James Bond type movie. The movie delves more into the dirty dark and nasty side of of the spy game and the use of human beings as fodder for an ends to a means.Good performances all around and a good movie. Check it out."
3,Could have been . . . .,"This movie was edited to death and dullness. Crucial scenes were obviously cut which threw the plot out of joint and into inaction. It could have been, and probably was before editing, a dandy cold war spy flic. It is worth three stars for historical value."
3,It's not his Polish accent,"Christopher Jones was indeed headed for great things via this film and his role in David Lean's Ryan's Daughter. David Lean cast the American actor as an injured British soldier in Ryan's Daughter on the strength of his wonderful Polish accent in this movie. Problem is: his voice was dubbed in Looking Glass War. That's why Jones speaks hardlly at all in Lean's film - couldn't do the English accent.This film does keep the cynical spirit of Le Carre's book. Hopkins is great - this was his first Hollywood incarnation when, I believe, he liked a drink - and the whole thing is true to the spirit of Le Carre."
3,Review,"It took too long to get it.I was expecting to receive this item on time,but do not know ,why it took too long?."

1,Thirteen bucks for this?,"Folks, this is more of a pamphlet than it is a book. It's 87 pages filled with large type and generous spaces between paragraphs and chapters. Remember when you were a kid and had to write a 20 page essay and you'd try to trick your teacher by making it look like 20 pages when it wasn't? That's exactly what this book is trying to do. I was going to return it to Amazon because I felt so cheated but I missed their 30 day grace period. The little information that this guide has is helpful but I felt the author could have added so much more to it. More personal insights on the business, more journal excerpts, etc. If you're serious about baby modeling and you've got $13 burning a hole is your pocket then by all means purchase this book. Otherwise, don't waste your money and buy something with a little more substance."
2,Ok industrial techno but not marvelous,Often interesting lyrics and some what used synth sounds make a rather incomplete album that you either like or despise. I thought it was decent for a few weeks but as I peered deeper into the tracks I noticed a level of immaturity in the abilities of the lyrics. The music itself is decent for gothic industrial but the album never enters classic cult status due to underdeveloped talent. Perhaps the band has aged since then and become more aquainted with the instruments. I do however like the singers voice distortion effects but they too are overdone in this genre.

5,Great weight lifting gloves,These gloves are inexpensive and durable. They do not rip in the palm like some more expensive gloves and protects your hands from callousing. They are the only gloves i'll ever use for lifting weights.
4,The Pleasure King's Bride By Emma Darcy,"Jared King is a self-assured business man who is capable of getting what he wants. Christabel Valdez possesses a strong sense of integrity and a secret. Can Jared discover and deal with this secret? Readers will be intrigued enough to find out. This book nicely concludes the three book series, Kings Of The Outback."
3,Could there be more?,This was the 3rd and final book of this series. It is the story of Jared and Christabel. Compared to Nathan's and Tommy's stories I found the story of the youngest King a disappointment. I never felt the chemistry between Jared and Christabel. Like his brothers' Jared will do anything to protect the ones he loves. The Outback provided some of the drive in the first 2 stories. In this one there isn't anything like that.
3,far too long,"I agree with DUSTY. I saw this documentary when it originally aired on The Discover Channel. It keeps repeating itself and really there's only about 15 minutes worth of material here. The bit (ha, it's a pun!) where they have mechanical robot jaws chomp down on some meat with a pressure sensor inside to indicate bite strength was nice. And what's with ""the only shark attack on a human ever recorded on film"" claim? Anyone can find genuine footage of shark attacks online. I got some nice great white attacks on kazaa ages ago. They're all over youtube now. However, the footage of the attack is professional and not like all those amateur videos where someone just happened to have a video camera going when a shark suddenly attacked. So there's goods and bads with this one. I'd buy the ""Operation Shark Attack Files"" instead of this one. I already own those so now I'm buying some dvds that focus on great whites. Hot-cha!"
2,Review of Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing 12,"I have purchased two versions of this program - Mavis Beacon 10 and Mavis Beacon 12 -- and have encountered the same problem with each. That is, both programs froze at the same point --the last beginner quiz before advancing to intermediate. In spite of the work by 2 computer service technicians, including email exchanges with the the parent company,the problem could not be solved. This is a defective product. I am in the process of requesting a refund. I have now purchased Typing Tutor 10 and am hoping for better results."
4,Great product but needs some flexibility,"I picked this up in a bargain bin, and now would have paid more. I was surprised that this SW enabled me to quickly unlearn bad pecking habits.I'd like to see more utilities to review my progress and an option to work on weak keys (still having trouble with g and h!)--Broderbund--listen up!Not sure if this is really a four star since I have not tried other typing programs."
1,Don't waste your time!,"I bought the version 10 a long time ago and it crashed over and over again. I liked the program-what little I was able to use. But, I had to give up on it. Sincee I liked the program, I took a flyer and decided to try MB again. So, last week I bought version 12 and it has the SAME problem! I am sending it back to the learning co. for a refund. I wish they could get it to work without crashing or ""freezing"" up. Too bad. Anyway, I have lost a lot of time and hope you think about this before you invest your time-let alone your money."
3,shawn weil,"If you started with mavis 5 and your still buying them through mavis 12, maybe you should just give up on learning to type...."
2,It has an unsupported bug,"I found this program to be very helpful in helping me to type, but I must warn that it has a bug in which if you don't pass the final quiz at the beginner level it freezes up.When I checked out the bug at the customer service site(support.learningco.com) the exact issue is adressed by telling you to do a ctrl + alt delete reboot your computer and try again if you fail the test.As good as the concept may be, I don't appreciate throwing my hard earned money away on unsupported software. I think that if you are going to make something available for sale to the public then it should be free of bugs. If it isn't bug free, the least you should do is offer a patch!"
3,complaint --- rules about space between sentences,"Dear Broderbund:I am in a computer training program and we just installed Mavis Beacon 12 in our computers (7 in our lab). My first complaint is the fact that we have to leave the computer disk in the disk reader in order to be able to use Mavis Beacon. If you take the disk out of the tower, even though you have downloaded the disk,Mavis is not there to call up and use.Another complaint is the rule about 2 spaces between sentences is not followed. Mavis consistently has only 1 space between sentences. This is a little irritating to say the least.Also, it takes a lot of time for a game to come up. You spend a lot of time looking at a black screen and you lose your momentum.I do enjoy using Mavis Beacon to improve my typing skills and speed but feel these problems should be addressed.Thank you for your time."
1,Not worth the CD it's burned on,"Like the Denver reviewer, I found the fixes for the many bugs absurd. The program refers you to the readme file on the CD, but there isn't one. I had every problem listed on their website. The fixes would have made my computer run as if it were 10 years old (turn off the ""read ahead"" on the CD player?!?) Now it freezes up right away and I can't use it at all (2 days old). I downloaded a freeware program to use for now. At least it works!"
4,Pretty good game,"Its no Hearts of Iron II, but its still a pretty good WWII game. Pretty fast paced and the AI is ok. I recommend it more for multiplayer than anything else."
3,Just being honest,"Being a history major in college and primarily focusing on WWII, I loved the detail of the units and the sound was amazing. What is really weak on the game is the air power. Germany in this game is very weak and so is Japan. There could have been a lot more selection from the air forces that would have been a perfect game. Everything else comes together well in this game but the air power simply does not cut it and brings the game down to just a simple three star vote for me. Wouldnt it be nice to actually select what type of bombs to load (Napalm,Incendiary,Iron, and such, as well as having fighter selection to run their own missions......come on......hopefully this company will get it right next time."
3,Not What I Expected,Actually it is a combination of the original Axis and Allies with and Age Of Empire game like. The games focuses more on single battles strategies (Age Of Empires like) than on the resource-strategy World War which I was looking for.
3,Old version is better,"This review is for whose prefer to play games from 90's. I bought this game by mistake, thinking it was an old version. I was disappointed that they removed airplanes and ships. The land units move across the water automatically. There is no air or water battles. No strategy except for land might. I never liked RTS anyway. If you love the older version, stay away from this one."
4,Skip this game completely!,"This game is not a game to play solitaire with. The AI is weak and an experienced player can beat it every time. It should only be played solitaire until you have the basics down. The real game play was on the internet. Unfortunately, Atari has decided not to support internet play. Thus, since multi-player play is no longer an option, I would skip this game. All the value in the game was from multi-player play and now that is not available. I originally gave this game a five star rating because of internet play. With that option gone I would rate it 1 star."
2,Poor substitute for the board game,"I played the board game of A&A for a long time and I was excited to get this game. Unfortunately, it didn't feel much like the game at all. The AI in the World War II section was horrible and it was easy to overwhelm after a few turns. The actual battles were a bit better and often kept me on my toes but it was not enough to win me over."
5,Excellent for Multiplayer Internet/LAN,"Great game overall, but the best of it is during multiplayer and working in teams. Strategy games are many today, but few can last as long as this one has!"
1,should have listened to other reviewers!,"I'm glad I only paid $10 for it, because it's going in the trash. There is no good way to play multi-player and the real-time portion of the game is weak at best. I bought it to play multi-player like the Iron Blitz version....it's nothing like that."
3,I love cras!,"Crash is my 2nd favorite next to Mario. this game is proving to be really hard. i haven't gotten very far on it since it is so challenging, but Crash is Crash and I am a true fan."
5,Wintley,I play this music over and over again. Wintley is such a wonderful artist and person and it shows in his musical selections. I love this album.
3,I'm a fence sitter on this one...,"This is a CD that I have been debating on whether to keep or get rid of for some time. There are many great songs on here that are catchy and clever, but there are some mediocre ones as well. I love ""Killing Me"", ""Kiss Me Quick"" and ""Luvrgrl"" the most. Moulin Noir obviously has some talent, but a lot of the songs have the same beat and many of the lyrics cheese me out. So to keep or not to keep? I still haven't decided..."
1,Mindless noodling; horrible vocals,"VDGG and GG are two of my favorite bands; one is even still functional. I had heard Masquerading with Dawn many years ago and thought it reasonably pleasant. Unfortunately, it doesn't wear well, and tracks from this album are the best on this anthology. The singing is awful - it was on MwD too but I tried to look past that before. 27 tracks is too much to bear. The music - mindless noodling sums it up. My recommendation - save your money. According to Amazon, customers who bought this album also bought Gryphon, Greenslade, or Porcupine Tree. All are better choices."
5,Great Tool To Introduce Waste Identification,This DVD is a very good tool for introducing staff level employees to Identifying Waste. The use of a simplistic process such as making toast really helped our staff level employees see the waste in processes.Very Good Tool.
5,The Physician and the Actor,"Another entertaining read from G.A. Hauser. Sets up the whole ""Action!"" series of 14 books to follow with Mark, Steve, Jack, Adam, Alexander and their assortment of gay L.A. friends."
1,Keep your money,"The ipod ear-buds are garbage. They sound terrible, won't stay in your ears, and most of all hurt your ears. They look like they would do the trick. The design is good but the material are not. The are too flimsy and cannot be adjusted to work as you would think. Back to the drawing board for these things and in the garbage can for mine."
3,Love the Tao but seems a little watered down,I have read the Tao Te Ching over the years several times. I read it when I need to calm down and consider life a little more. I was a bit disappointed with this one. Seems a little too quick of a read. The formatting I didn't care for and just seemed a bit different than the full books I have. Serves a purpose but not all I expected or maybe hoped for?
1,where are photographs ?!,"Being a proud owner of the Tao Te Ching by Gia-Fu Feng & Jane English hardcopy, I was very excited to find that a Kindle version was coming out in 1012.I've read the hardcopy so often it is falling apart.My excitement turned into bitter disappointment when I discovered (after purchasing it) that the Kindle version only consists of plain text, without the beautiful photographs and calligraphy.Why didn't I check this in advance you might ask.I did, but the downloadable sample only contains the foreword, which I didn't expect to have any photographs.Had I known the rest of the book consisted of only plain text as well, I would not have bought it."
2,No illustrations,I wish I would have read the reviews then I would have seen that the kindle edition doesn't have the wonderful illustrations. I have a large paperback of the book and love the illustrations. I expected to get the same book for when I travel on the kindle. The pictures and illustrations are a significant contribution to the text. I would recommend the book but not the kindle edition.
3,critical changes from Feng and English's orginal translation and has none of english's art:,"Subtle changes in wording here and there that are glaring if you are familar with the orginal. Secondly, the absence of English's art takes something away. For a read of the Tao, it is still good. but..."
1,Not clearly labeled and reviews misleading,"This book was not clearly labeled that it does not contain the photos, and most of the reviews raved about the photos. It is definitely TEXT ONLY. I put it in the Salvation Army bin two minutes after I opened the package. Believe the tiny banner that says ""Text Only,"" NOT the reviews."
3,Disappointed.,"Having used the paperback edition for years, I am disappointed that the Kindle edition came without calligraphyor pictures. They are a great part of the translation and deny the reader the original intent."
2,Uninteresting Translation,"The primary reason anyone would want this particular edition of the Tao Te Ching is that is that it is compact. It's small, portable, and presumably easy to read. Unfortunately the translation is dis-jointed. As if it was translated for the words, as if the underlying meaning would speak for itself if it was translated directly.It's small size limits its value for a scholar, as it does not have much additional information. The translation is too dis-jointed to flow as poetry, so it doesn't have much value to anyone who simply wants to appreciate the beauty of the text."
4,The best translation of the Tao,The best translation of the Tao that I have come across. The translation seems slightly different from the previous editions but it is still my favorite. I highly recommend this translation to anyone who is interested in Taoism.
2,Kindle version has no illustrations,"I was looking for a nice illustrated version of the Tao Te Ching for my Kindle. Unfortunately the Kindle version lacks the calligraphy and photographs of the print version, and as the sample only includes the introduction (a common problem with this type of book) it's impossible to find this out before buying. Luckily it's easy to return Kindle content for a refund."
1,UGH!,"Don't waste your money! This book was so boring. It had nothing good about it. The plot was confusing and dull, there was no Nancy/Frank stuff, and once again, Nancy got the small potatoes case while the Hardys were chasing international spies or whatever. Huge disappointment. I had to force myself to read it so that my money wouldn't go to waste with the book just sitting on my shelf."
2,Plastic Stock,"The picture shows the right side of the stock as representative of the product -it is not - this is a monte carlo (raised cheekpad) style stock. No where in the product description is this stated. The stock is synthetic in that it is made of what looks like cheap ABS plastic (the same as in drain piping). Also, the recoil pad does not fit properly (not seamless with the stock). In my opinion it is overpriced for what you get. It did fit the rifle as described without alteration."
4,Dean From Hell,"Guitar was packed well came in a propper dean hsc and guitar looked good no damage except for a small crack in the clear coat on the neck. The guitar Plays nice but does not have much sustain or tone due to the fact that it is very light. This would be the only draw back for this guitar. It is a china made one and they seem to be allot lighter than thier korean counterparts, but crank up your amp and gain and you have a killer sounding guitar for the price. But if your looking for a good dean i would probably go with a razorback for the same price and just change the pick up to a bill lawrence."
3,Really Disappointed,"After visiting two separate running stores I decided to purchase these. I had several great runs in them until the fabric at the back of the heel (inside the shoe) began to stretch out of shape. The stretching caused folds which then led to blisters. When I contacted Mizuno for help, they insisted that I send the shoes to them for inspection. Many emails later, I still do not feel satisfied with the customer service, and I think I might have to just buy another pair of shoes. They were great while they lasted, but that wasn't long..."
3,A companion to Acoustically Driven,"And that's pretty much all it is. Most of these songs are available on the double-live CD ""Future Echoes Of The Past"", making this disc pretty much obsolete, unless you're the true Heep fan. The songs that aren't on that CD appear on Acoustically Driven (why repeat here?). Yes, it's a great recording, and Heep is on the mark, but the live versions here don't vary at all from those that appear on other more complete releases. Go for AD and FEOTP instead."
5,"what will ya say, If Bernie Shaw is not David Byron??","FOLKS! This is HEEP'S new line up in the 90's. So no matter what the people said about Uriah Heep. In fact, Uriah Heep sold out their albums from 1969 until 1996 circa 100 million copies worldwide. The same case like Zeppelin and Deep Purple, Black Sabbath did. The new bloods in the band are not bad, the original keyboarder Ken Hensley has gone to perform his own solo, The original singer David Byron died in the 80's but the legacy is still alive until now.The songs are excellent - masterpiece! need I say more?? The live sound in London is really damned good and excellent! featuring Ian Anderson on flute....."
4,Pretty Good - typical slow grower,"As with all bluegrass this one took about 4 weeks in early spring to germinate. But with twice daily watering with the occasional skipped day, this seed germinated well. All I had to do was scrape the hard packed soil with a rake and spread the seed. Bluegrass seed prefers a soil temp of 65 degrees and my soil temp was closer to 40-55 degrees. Warmer soil might have spurred the growth a bit more."
3,Insanity,"Brain Donors is a unique film. You will spend the first 15-20 minutes shocked at how stupid and unfunny it is. Then your brain clicks with the film's sense of humor and you are in risk of physical harm from laughing as it progresses. The style is straight Marx Brothers with no apologies. It piles absurdity upon impossibility and creates a mini universe in which only the nonsensical has any meaning. It is not Citizen Kane, but when you are worn down by a horrible day at work, it will stun you back into a decent mood. ""Humor by hammer"" would be the best description."
4,Wonderful!,"This is my second MKA book, and i loved it as much as Hissy Fit. Katherine and M.B. kept me laughing, as did Dinky Davis, AKA Parker. I can't wait to read more!"
5,Funny and fun to read!,"If you are looking for a great beach read (even if the ""beach"" is your own back yard), you won't go wrong picking up any of the books by Mary Kay Andrews. This one is good enough that I kept reading it even after I realized I had read it once before soon after it first came out.The author writes the kind of women characters I'd want to have as friends. Even when they are making big mistakes, they dive in head first and stick with each other through thick and thin.I enjoyed this book as much the second time around as the first. But this time I'm going to put the recipe for Beyond the Grave Chicken Salad into my recipe files. It sounds so good it might be worth the price of the book!ETA: I made the chicken salad recipe for my neighborhood block party and it was a big hit!"
4,Hard to fathom someone so clueless....,"It's hard to fathom anyone being so clueless that her husband can steal ALL their money without her having any idea. If that were me, I would not protect my daughter, I would share the facts so that she can learn from my mistakes (and adjust her lifestyle as well)!This was a good story and a lot of fun to read, but pretty far-fetched. It was a little too ""happily ever after"" at the end, but that's OK every now and then."
3,Little Bitty Lies,"This was a funny and interesting read. Certainly not profound, but just entertaining. Sometimes we need just a silly, farfetched story and this was one. It also illustrates how out of hand a ""little bitty lie"" can get."
3,Different idea but fun to read!,"This wasn't my fav read, but it did get entertaining as the book went on. It was almost a ""no way they can pull this off"" type book, but ended pretty good. I liked the last 1/3 of the book the best. I giggled out loud in a few parts. It's a fun and easy read."
3,Little Bitty Lies,"Entertaining but not engulfing. Good Fluff read. Nice mix of friendship, romance, spirit and strength. A low key summer read."
3,Not her best but still worth the time to read,"I loved Hissy Fit, The Fixer Upper, Savannah Blues. They were some of the best woman's fiction I had read in a long time - good story, amazing characters - I laughed, I cried. But Little Bitty Lies was not as well written. The story was flat, took some time to develop, then only became an ok story. I did, however, love the characters as I have in all of MK Andrews books. Mary Bliss did some crazy things, but given her circumstances, it was understandable. And Katharine? Every woman should have a friend like her. Wild and crazy schemes? Yes. But a true friend, always there through thick and thin. All that being said, the ending was very satisfying for me. Most everyone got their happy ending and it left me feeling that the time I spent with this book, was worth it inspite of it's faults. I will always read this author."
4,Little Bitty Lies is a whole lotta fun to read,"What happens when your husband ups and leaves you after cleaning out all the bank accounts, and mortgaging your house to the hilt? You and your best friend plan his demise to collect on his life insurance, right? Well, maybe.. That is the plan of Mary Biss and Katherine, but sometimes things don't always go as planned. What a great adventure, and laugh out loud fun read!"
4,Very Funny!,"I love Mary Kay Andrews' style of writing. Funny herione that takes no prisoners - this book doesn't disappoint! Mary Bliss is a great character, that clearly evolved from a perfect southern wife to a strong, independent woman. I laughed out loud at some of the situations Mary Bliss found herself in. I really enjoy Andrews' descriptions of the south and southern debutants. She really gets your attention with some of the funniest situtations for the characters. I love the fact that her female characters are all very strong women (girls) that don't need a man to rescue them, but will use them (men) for all they are worth when necessary. Chick lit at it's best!"
3,Not that great,"Let me preface this by saying i am no fan of southern novels. So you probably shouldn't take my critique too seriously. We selected this for our book club (big mistake) and it just wasn't all that great. No substance, no depth -- a lot of dorky southern cliches. Not a fun experience."
3,Not her best,"I like this author for her light-hearted romance and mystery, but this book let me down. I didn't buy the BFF's, the story with the husband didn't ring true, and the daughter's story was too serious. Not like the Savannah books."
3,Humorous waying of offing a cheatin' ex,"Rather than admit to her friends and neighbors that her husband Parker left her (and drained their accounts), Mary Bliss does what any self respecting southern belle would do - pretend he is dead and collect the life insurance. With the help of her eccentric best friend Katherine (who is nursing who own wounds of abandonment), the two women set out to create a fake diving accident with the help of a shady con man.She does not count on nosy investigator, Matt Hayslip coming into the fold. Or her babbling mother in law who just might be in contact with Parker. Or her newly separated neighbor wanting to be more than neighbors. Or con-man Dinky Davis coming back for more.Just what's a girl to do when she digs a hole this deep? ""Little Bitty Lies"" is a humorous tale of one woman's quest to not be idle gossip, only to wreak more havoc on her life, and learn that her perfect marriage was just an illusion."
2,Not Up To Snuff,"I'm late to enter the world of MK Andrews' readers. Started with Savannah Blues, which was all that and a bag of chips. It was SO much fun I bought most everything else she'd written. Little Bitty Lies was, occasionally, worth the read. So, it fell into the category, for me, of mostly-speed-read. I've, since, read earlier of her things (under a different name) and later of her things, so I insist this isn't representative. But, in this one case, she seemed to phone it in."
3,It had it's moments but it's not one of Mary Kay's best efforts.,"I listened to the Audio book version of this and the reader Debra Monk did a fine job. The story fell short for me because of the characters , I just could not buy into them. Mary Bliss was lacking in just plain good judgement too much of the time. The pauper grandmother ends up saving the day despite her longstanding hatered of Mary Bliss and that jerk of a husband was such a fantastic creep how M.B. would fail to notice before he cleaned her out and blew town I do not know. Over the course to 20 years for her to have no clue is hard to swallow. There were some laughs but next to the unrestrained humor in her other books this one fell flat."
2,I have to disagree with the other reviewers...,"I really liked the Callahan Garrity series, and I LOVED ""Savannah Blues,"" so I was excited to get my hands on ""Little Bitty Lies,"" but it was a huge disappointment. The writing is stilted, and the third-person point of view doesn't do justice to Andrew's talent or sense of humor. I hated the ridiculous plot, and halfway through the book, I started skimming, just so I'd know how it ended. I'm hoping that ""Hissy Fit"" is better, since that's the only one of hers I haven't read yet."
3,Ok but not great,"This is one of Mary Kay Andrews' earlier novels, and it was just ok for me. I prefer when MKA writes in the first person, and this story is written in third person, so it lacked her usual ""sparkle"" for me. Mary Bliss was annoying; she was too focused on what was ""proper"" and outward appearances, which became more and more irritating as the book went on. And her daughter was such an incredibly spoiled brat, which made me dislike Mary Bliss even more for continuously putting up with it. The story itself was pretty farfetched; like someone could come up with a scheme like that and not get in trouble legally.It was readable, but not up to par with Hissy Fit, which in my opinion was the best so far written under the Mary Kay Andrews name."
5,Mixture of sex and chicken salad,"I LOVED this book. Mary Kay Andrews is bound to hit to bestseller list and perhaps this is the book that will do it for her. Little Bitty Lies reads very quickly, and that was because I found it difficult to stop reading before I finished it. Mary Bliss and Katherine are wonderful characters, and show friendship at its finest. I wanted to slap Erin, slug Parker and smooch Matt, all great characters. The book has sex, love, friendship, money, humor in addition to a great chicken salad recipe (and yes, I've tried it, and it's super). A fast, fun, frolicky read that is a perfect summer book. Another winner from Mary Kay Andrews. Keep 'em coming, Mary Kay! Eager readers everywhere will be panting waiting for your next one."
4,cute and entertaining,"Had my book club not picked this as this months read, i dont think i would have read it otherwise. However i am happy to say that i am glad that i read it. Mary Bliss lives in a neighbourhood where everyone was getting a divorce. She felt rather secure in her relationship, so she was blown away when she came home and found a note from her husband saying he wants out. But that SOB didnt just leave nicely and quietly; he took everything. All the money, cashed in investments, took out a second mortgage with a balloon payment due in a couple of months. With her friend Katherine, Mary comes up with a plan on how to save herself. Fake her husbands death to collect the title insurance on the house. Pretty good idea, does it work?Mary Bliss is a strong woman, i was happy to see that she didnt crumple and fold under the pressure. Overall its a good read!"
5,Excellent for Cancer patients!,My dad was diagnosed with cancer and lost 10 lbs just in the first 2 weeks of radiation therapy and we knew we had to do something. We chose Ensure Plus instead of Ensure for its higher calorie and protein content. Ensure Plus has various flavors to choose from which is a bonus.
4,Very Good!,it is very nice to have a company the have international delivery because here in Sweden it's very difficult to buy Latin music so thank you the only thing the i don't like is that it takes a long time but other wise it is very good.
4,Hard to find,This disc lasted 20 years to be released to the market. Now that is available you will be able to enjoy the full Amanda Miguel collection.This DVD features also a collection of nice videos of Amanda in Puerto Rico.
4,Definitely different,"I listen to Madonna now just to see what she will do differently. In the age of the artist who sings the same songs written by someone else, Madonna is a shining beacon to what is right about music. She has originality and constant innovation.As for this single in particular, while the lyrics are really simple, the various versions of the song are significantly different. I have to admit however that the lyrics are so simple that I really can't listen to this single over and over, instead I have it in my 12 disc changer so when the Random feature gets to the CD, it will pick 1 of the 9 versions."
5,grab this maxi!,"I've bought the imported copiesC (CD1 & CD2) but when I found this maxi-single which compiles the 2 discsso neatly into one , I just have to get it so I could listen to it while driving without switching discs.This maxi single is really worth all its money. My favorite mixes are ranked HQ2 club mix, deep dish dot club mix and young collective mix. Calderone is good as ever but is low in my ranks comparatively. Sadly missing is the young collective's radio mix (foudn in CD2 import) which has Madonna start in acapella ""Hey Mr DJ put the record on..."". This intro makes everyone scream in the club whenever it's played."
4,Rocks - but where are the lyrics??,"This song rocks - it has a really good beat, but the remixes on this CD have hardly any lyrics."
5,Do you want to boogie woogie?,"I have listened to Mo' since she was a ""virgin"" and let me tell you ...this song and its remixes makes you want to shake it in your pants and show 'em how to dance! I have only owned this maxi-CD single for one day and have already blown the speakers out of my car! Buy this one, put the record on, and dance with your baby!"
3,Another stellar departure,"Madonna's music CD single is chock full of remixes, each one worthy of its own call to the dance floor. The HQ2 and the Groove Armada Remixes are special standouts - tweaking the song enough to eke out atmospheric nuances without straying too far from the original. A minor flaw was not to include the LP version as well as the b-side track ""Cyberrega"". All in all, these remixes are further testament to Madonna's astuteness in choosing A-list remixers and producers to work beside her. In so doing, she never fails to surprise."
4,FINALLY THE REMIXES ARE HERE!!,"THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD CD , OK REMIXES TRACK 1 HQ2 CLUB MIX 8:50 TRACK 2 CALDERONE ANTHEM MIX 11:55 TRACK 3 DEEP DISH DOT COM REMIX 11:21 TRACK 4 GROOVE ARMADA CLUB MIX 9:29 TRACK 5 YOUNG COLLECTIVE CLUB MIX 13:16 TRACK 6 HQ2 RADIO MIX 4:04 TRACK 7 CALDERONE RADIO EDIT 4:25 TRACK 8 DEEP DISH DOT COM RADIO EDIT 4:15 TRACK 9 GROOVE ARMADA 12"" MIX 5:30 THIS HAS NO ALBUM EDIT , THOUGH TRACK 2 IS THE BEST"
3,"Hey Mr DJ, put my OTHER records on!","I was really pshyched to hear that Madonna was releasing her first single from her upcoming album. However, when I heard the song past the cool entrance, I was almost instantly... bored. This song has no depth, musically, and lyrically. Catchy production, and deep grooves, but the song itself is, well, boring. I recived the Canadian single --- which has 4 mixes: the album version (original) The Groove Armada 2""... Calderone... and Deep Dish .com Radio Edit. The ORIGINAL was the best, and from there on, the song deteriorated. I highly reccomend ""Nothing Really Matters"" and, from The Next Best Thing, TIME STOOD STILL. Now THOSE are true Madonna songs. I'm just praying her new album is like ""Time Stood Still"", or even ""Ray Of Light""... keeping my fingers crossed!!!!!!"
4,There's a lotta MUSIC on this CD-single!,"One would have to be an obsessive Madonna fan to get into this five version (the other four are ""edits)set from Madonna's 2000 ""Music"" LP. Each cut is typical ""club fare"" featuring thundering beats, extended vocals, and technological tricks as performed by the various mixers/producers.At over seventy-three minutes, there is definitely more Madonna to greet the ear.HQ2 Club Mix - 8:52Calderone Anthem Mix - 11:57Deep Dish Dot Com Remix - 11:24Groove Armada Club Mix - 9:31The Young Collective Club Mix - 13:16HQ2 Radio Mix - 4:06Calderone Radio Edit - 4:28Deep Dish Dot Com Radio Edit - 4:17Groove Armada 12 Mix - 5:29"
3,Doesn't contain the video/radio (best) version...,"that version is only on the album which to me is a tragedy. Despite the fact that the versions of Music that are contained within are fine interpretations of the original this is a case where the remixes aren't nearly as good as the original. All of the mixes on this CD-Single are very techno/trance oriented. I probably prefer the Calderone mixes over the others but all of these versions combined can't compare to the original.I was expecting to at least get a longer cut of the original version, which to me is more r&b/club oriented than these o.k. but watered down versions of a great cut.I bought the single because other than 'Music' I wasn't particulary fond of the album overall. In my mind a CD-Single should contain all versions of the cut."
1,Weak,Madonna has been watching way too much of Lil Kim&The Current Girl Formula going on.the Video she bites Lil Kim&the song is a whole bunch of Different things put together that don't work.nothing new under the sun.aside from 1994's Bedtime story Madonna has been doing the same style since the Erotica Album.Nothing new under the sun.this would have been cool say about 7 years back but it's pretty Predictable stuff.Typical Overrated Madonna.
5,"STOP SEARCHING FOR DEEP MEANING, YOU GUYS, AND...","...accept this CD for what it is, a simple dance song. Anyone who says that it's not a great dance tune either can't dance or doesn't care for dancing. It's one of the better beats Madonna has produced. Enjoy it for what it is. Don't hate it for what it's not.PS--It surprises me how critical people can be of greatness."
2,Music sucks,"The remixes are OK. This is the worst single from Madonna, vocally and lyrically just not interesting. It might be fun to dance to at the club but not worth buying. I'm afraid to find out what the album will be like. And what's up with her in the cowboy outfit? Ray of Light album is by far her best and she should've won for best album. Also, heard somewhere regarding on her new album, Madonna wanted to have fun. There's a difference between having fun and taking the easy way out and I think she did the later. Relying way too much on the remixers to pump up a weak single. DO NOT BUY THIS! Get it from Napster (lol)."
1,Everything but what I wanted,"When I buy a CD single, it's because I've heard the song on the radio or have seen the video and I like it. That's the song I want. I'm not a club person who gets all into remixes. I just wanted the song, for Pete's sake! Instead I got 9 songs I didn't want, only one of which comes close to the distinctive sound of the version out on radio and video. Call me picky, but seeing three tracks listed on the CD as ""radio"" versions is misleading. Grr!"
2,WARNING!,"People, people...and I write this as a fan of Madonna since the beginning of her career...I just bought the MUSIC album (in Europe it just came out) and to date it's one of her worst efforts. I hate to say that about Madonna, but truth be known this record is flat, without interest, and at times embarassingly predictable. I'm sorry but if you want to hear some good European-style music that is far better then this album, try the band Air (The Virgin Suicide Soundtrack is brilliant) or better yet try out the new Hooverphonic album called The Magnificent Tree---absolutely stunning! I strongly suggest these two bands before this new Madonna album. Don't believe the hype on her new album (sorry Madonna but it's just flat as ever)."
1,Not the Real Thing,"I was extremley disappointed in this single. I wanted the real thing, the orginal version of Music. All of the versions on the single don't even compare. Take it from me, wait for the CD."
4,Music has ARRIVED,"Lately, I have been listening to a bunch of Madonna's songs and I am overly obsessed with it. Now, I have bought the single for ""MUSIC"" and it's fantastic. It's been flying around Napster with a version that wasen't even finished yet, but now this CD single is the best. Best quality, sound and something extra too! Madonna's album ""MUSIC"" is a sure hit, but make sure this single is not one of those ""one-hit wonders"". As for my obsession, I will get through it sometime soon, but now I am just enjoying the music and the melodies."
4,Very good cd single satsifies my appetite until Sept. 19th,"I was a bit dissappointed to find out that this cd maxi single didn't contain the album version of the song. But oh well. That one comes out next week, so I can wait. This cd is still very good. I often love remixes as much as the songs themselves, sometimes more. The remixes here are very good and very fun to drive to. Some are very long (11 to 13 minutes) others are normal song lengths. My favorite mix on this one is number 6, I've listened to it and the rest of this all day since I got it. I raced out of school and went to buy it. I'm glad I did. I can't wait for the release of ""Music - the album""!!"
5,REMIXES GALORE,"Finally, the US sees a CD single on par with the imports. This maxi-single contains nine tracks...all remixes of ""Music."" If you're looking for the original version, you'll have to wait for the album. The first five remixes are all at least 9 minutes long...the last four are shortened radio edits of the first 5. Total running time: 73 MINUTES! The DJ's remixing are some of the most talented in the biz. The HQ2 mix has been all over the clubs in my home town. The Calderone Athem will make you feel like you are at the Roxy in NYC on a Saturday night. The Deep Dish cut has the hardest beats on the CD, and it MAKES you dance. The Groove Armada mix funktifies things adding some bass guitar and percussion along with some strings. Definitely the most original mix on the CD. The Young Collective mix mellows the collection out, adding in some soft keyboards along with the beats. If you're a Madonna fan, this is a great CD single!"
5,Madonna's Music single,"This cd is incredible. If you are a Madonna fan of any caliber you must have this cd. It clocks in at over 73 minutes. The worlds biggest star has proven again why she is the undisputed ""Queen of Pop"". You go girl!!!!!"
4,madonna goes r&b,"The new madonna single, hmm, sounds quite good. No matter what's ""in"" , this women always goes with it. And she does quite well. A really rousing song."
1,Wi-Fi problems known to Sony and Unfixed,I have been having intermittent wifi problems. Meaning the connection drops and does not reacquire. This is a known problem with the LAN-Express AS 802.11g component that is used (check a google search for sony laptop intermittent wireless failure) in the machinebut Sony will not acknowledge that there is a problem. They invite me to send in my laptop for a month but I can't do without it for a month. I'm stuck.
1,Donot buy this Notebook,I donot like this Note book.1)It is too slow. It takes atleast 5 mins to open the hotmail page while using a 11Mbps wireless Lan.2)The system hangs too often. It takes too long to open any application.3)The customer service is poor. The customer service representatives do not respond to your requests.
3,Great Coffee LEmon of a Machine,"I purchased a used Saeco Italia on Ebay and for the first few espresso shots it worked great, and the coffee tasted great. A few weeks later it started leaking water from the bottom, a few weeks more it became 3+ounces of water every shot, a few weeks later the steam knob blew off. Now I have a machine without steam it leaks like crazy and most recently the electronics caused it to jam. It thinks it needs water but even though it's full of water won't reset. It's a lemon and will take $200 to fix with shipping. Good Luck Get a Warranty. Mine was made in 2004."
4,Espresso Delight,"the Saeco 178435 Italia Home Espresso Cappuccino Machine does everything it is advertised to do. The automatic grinder and tamper works great and saves time. The steamer/frother is a little slow sometimes, but the lattes and mochas taste as good as anything you can get from a barista."
1,DON'T DO IT -- The worst of the Saeco line,"Breaks a lot -- hard to repair..... I know, I repair 'em!ALSO DISCONTINUED!! look elsewhere! and dont' get a refurb! Please? dave"
4,Perfect (Almost) all the time - over 2 1/2 years now,"Looks like a lot of people have had bad luck with this machineI have been very happy with it, I bought it refurbed for about $350 over 2 years ago and have pulled 15 to 20 shots from it every day.It is a bit temperamental at times getting a bit lost during its programA few times i thought it had died on me , but with a little patients and cleaning and re setting it was back.Now I pull it apart about once a month for cleaning- found a coffee bean it likes (so it does not clog)and use filtered water - We are now very happy together :)Have only de scaled once in 2 years, so maybe it's time to do that.But really, for the price it is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone, with a little patients to understand it, it works just fineI moved to Brazil where the voltage is a little higher, a lot of my appliances died, but not the Saeco - still going and with amazing flavorful Brazilian coffee beans - Perfect!"
3,Great coffee when it works,"Bought a refurb Italia about 2 years ago, (seems to be a TON of refurbs on the market for some reason?) loved it for the first couple weeks until it died. Had to send it in to Saeco (cost me $40 to ship) got it back in about a month, worked great until today. I refilled the water chamber, and all lights went out. Plug still works, checked everything without taking it apart. Hopefully it is just the switch or something. Anyway, if you buy one of these, expect some great espresso, but also expect problems with the machine in a short time."
2,"Unfortunately, mine broke too","I bought one of the refurbs that are available here except I bought it at Fry's and bought a 2 year extended warranty. It didn't make it 50 days. It blew out the portafilter and sprayed grounds and hot water everywhere. I took it back and they gave me another refurb. This one won't grind the beans nearly fine enough. My ""espresso"" looks like tea. Even after adjusting the grinder a bunch of times and pulling 10 or more shots.This one is going back tomorrow. Bummer. I really liked the first one but even on that one it seemed I had to put the grinder on the finest setting to get anything approaching espresso."
1,DON'T DO IT!,"The Jon Doyle product we purchsed was filmed by amateurs in a noisy gym...kids and others laughing, talking, shouting in the backround. The sound quality was so poor you cannot hear the instructions. In fact it is just annoyingly noisy! Don't do it!"
1,Childlike Confusion,"Icons are intended for pre-schoolers. The menu appears to be a game that would appeal to puzzle enthusiasts. Very illogical layout. This purchase is a mistake for anyone looking to make greeting cards. When I buy software, I expect a professional package. I am still shaking the bax to find the crayons - it is that bad!"
1,Why can't they just take the best version 3 and add more ev,I just bought a new system loaded with windows xp and my creatacard 3 my only card maker I will ever use won't work on windows XPHelp why can't they just add more for 3 I would even purchase more just to keep this version the best calendar and reminds you its just the best and I see most others feel the same wayCan't they figure it out 3 was their best and easiest card maker yet! LOST WITH OUT MINE LOADING WIN 98 JUST SO i CAN USE IT AGAIN
2,CreateACard 6.0 not completely compatible with XP,"I have had this program since fall of 2001 and love it as far as the clipart, etc. goes! When we installed Windows XP, we found that it is not completely compatible. For instance, the envelopes will not print correctly, and the print wizard for the cards, won't set up properly. I have to print all envelopes from Word. I have never been able to send an electronic greeting, maybe because I have a broadband server, I don't know. Also, it is impossible to import a picture from it into an email. Twice I have had the program 'crash' and had to reinstall it."
1,Platinum 5 vs Platinum 6: Not worth it,"Using Platinum 5 for the past 6 months, I was hoping the new Platinum 6 version would provide an easier to use interface, print WYSIWYG, and that the images would be improved.The interface is still the same and it still has the annoying habit of changing the color of your screen to neon colors while you are using the application. (Alt-Tab to another screen like Word).The version 6 images IMO are worse than the 5 version. It seems American Greetings is going more after children for this product by using cartoon-ish images and images that look like they were painted in water colors with a big fat brush.I did not test the WYSIWYG printing due to the disappointment with the images. I will be returning the Platinum 6 version and will stick with the Platinum 5 version."
3,"great tuna, false advertising","I love tuna and this is excellent tuna. I was disappointed however that there was only one tin! Guess I should have read closer, but as the picture showed three cans I expected three cans. Would suggest to buyers to purchase the $31 can instead!"
1,Misleading ad,"The item description says that the antenna fits v300, v330, v551. When I received the antenna, it doesn't fit my Motorola v551. This is a real hassle since I now have to deal with customer service for returns and still can't use my phone. I would stay away from eforcity."
5,There is only one thing to say.....Bravo!,"I have been extremely enlightened by this author. This book so simply shows how our government has defected from the original idea of our forefathers who created a great country and a great system, and how easy it can be to get it back again."
4,Whatever Happened to Justice?,"Certainly makes you think about the fundamentals. Would like to see some additional extension on common law specifics.A quick, absorbing read!"
5,"page for page, maybe one of greatest books of all time","I'm not kidding. I've read mises, hayek, rothbard, dawkins, and many other great writers and influential works. But page for page, with its clarity and ability to transform an average uneducated person to almost genius... The logic, peppered with awesome bits of history... This is one of the greatest books of all time. The one-two punch of Richard's Whatever happened to penny candy(about economics) with this book, is perhaps the best gift one can make to a young person just starting out in life and to an adult as well. Just awesome, all the books in the uncle eric series are must haves period. No sequence of easy to read pages can do so much to educate a human being as the uncle eric series."
4,"How do you say ""Swordfishtrombones"" in Italian?","Not that Vinicio Capossela sounds just like an Italian Tom Waits...and it would be pretty cool if he did...but there's a certain maniacal whimsical dusty carnival tavern vibe that the two share. I can't understand 90% of the lyrics, but the music is very entertaining, very interesting, very...authentic? I hear influences, but this guy is marching to his own beat. It was a recommendation from a friend that I check this out. I'm very glad that I did!"
4,Excellent start,I think the book was excellent in terms of its exposure of the infamous drug hustle game that so many get caught up in. The book serves as a true testimony for others to learn from. I however was very disturbed about the amount of grammatical errors in my book. Was it just my copy or is that just how the book is.. if so? Please think about revising the book and coming out with a 2nd edition. I also think a screenplay for this movie would be ideal.
3,"Recommended, Great Story - Writing Style is OK.","I agree with Big Mu Ha's review. I feel Duane Blake didn't go into enough details about the events that took place. I am sure for legal reasons it makes sense to leave a lot of detail out. The book went into details about people. The beginning of the book is very strong, it kept me the reader very engaged. Towards the end, during the years of prison seem very high-level - not too much detail. I def recommend this book to anyone who enjoys organization crime, gangs, murder stories. Esp if you are Jamaican, you can relate to much of the content. Great story to remember.."
5,"2 Thumbs Up, Way Up!!!","One of the most rivetting and spectacular books I've read in years!! Shower Posse takes you through the life of Vivian Blake the leader of the most notorious gang of the last century. If you liked the movie ""Scarface"" you'll love this book. Once you start reading this book you will not want to put it down."
3,Most Notorious?,"You know there are a lot of books that come out saying that certain groups were the most notorious. I heard of these cats coming up, but I am not 100% sure that Shower was the most notorious. I know they were hustlin strong in Philly and were doing things in D.C. and what not. I like Duane's writing, but I just dont think it was enough details. Jamaican gangs were a dime a dozen back in the 80's. And I think it is a bit biased because he is writing about his Pop which I can respect. Good job anyways"
4,Good review of street situations to watch out for,"This is not like David's other books. It is not as wordy. It has short paragraphs on each page showing a different strategy. It is good for review and, the author wanted it short and sweet and book size small, so you can take it with you on the road. Some of the information is mentioned in his other books. I like it for fast reviewing. But doesn't go over riding techniques just safety review of what to look for in traffic and road conditions."
5,Graduate Level Motorcycling,David Hough continues to be the ultimate guru of motorcycle safety and handling. Common sense information for better riding skills coupled with safety information every biker should know. Safety is centered on anticipating and avoiding problems that require emergency avoidance action. With humor and style there's no loss of machismo in safe riding. Information that every weekend biker and commuter should know.
2,Street Srategies: A Survival Guide for Motorcyclists,"This book would be ideal for the beginning biker. It covers basic safety procedures, many of which are common to driving a car. Basically, it's using common sense. This book re-enforces all that is learned in the motorcycle training course prior to getting your license. It would be a great read for a young, beginning driver and motorcylist. It should be rated for the 'beginner motorcyclist'."
3,For Beginners...,"""Street Strategies"" is a decent book for new riders. I purchased the book as a review and to determine if I had developed any bad habits. The booked turned into a very basic review of what I already knew as a 30+ year rider. There are some very good points and some common sense ""heads up"" type information that a newer rider may not consider. If you're an experienced rider you may not gain much from the book but it would make a nice gift for new riders."
4,Top notch,Enjoyable read. Spot on. Certainly makes you aware of compromising situations you need to be aware of . Worth reading at the beginning of each season as a reminder.
5,Best motorcycle safety book ever!,Highly recommend for every motorcycle rider who rides the streets. I've recommended this book to all of my rider friends.
3,Entertaining stories with useful morals,"Street strategies is a collection of ""stories"" that are part or all of articles written by David Hough. The stories are entertaining and similar (if not identical in some cases) to stories contained in Proficient Motorcycling.This is more of a waiting room kind of book. Very short chapters with cartoon diagrams that give the reader insight into the type of dangers that he/she might encounter in the real world of motorcycle riding and some advice on how to avoid them. It lacks the detail that makes Proficient Motorcycling and More Proficient Motorcycling such excellent training guides for riders.This book might make a good stocking stuffer for someone who has already read the other books but if your looking for something for a starting/experienced rider pick one of the other two books (Proficient Motorcycling for the starter, ""More"" for the more experienced rider)."
3,"Second rate compared to ""Proficient Motorcycling""","""Proficient Motorcycling"" by Mr. Hough is the Bible of motorcycling, in my opinion. When I saw this book available by Mr. Hough, I immediately purchased it thinking it would add tons of wisdom to what I had read and re-read in ""Proficient Motorcycling"". It didn't. I felt it was a repeat of many of the items discussed in ""PM"". The style of the book is unique in that you can read each topic within a few minutes and put it down to read another topic later. Each topic takes two pages with 50% of the space devoted to graphics/pictures. For those who like the USA Today type of articles, this book is five stars. For myself, I like more details and because of that only give it three. Was it a waste of money - no. Could you spend your money better elswhere - yes - on ""Proficient Motorcycling""."
3,A minor piece of nostalgia,"With only 3 songs spread out over 35 minutes, this one can be hard to swallow sometimes, but to be honest, reworking ""I'm A Man"" by The Spencer Davis Group into a 17-minute disco workout was actually a pretty good idea. Next time you're trying to put together a compilation for an old-school dance party, that would probably be a good choice for it."
3,Haven't used yet.,Received the product in a timely manner. The sad thing is that it is missing the first cassette tape of a series of 16 lessons. I will have to try to find the missing tape. Rats!!!
4,Pretty earrings!!,"I love threader earrings, especially swarovski crystal earrings. These are very pretty; however, they are a little longer than most. Also, be sure to wear the backs on them since the crystal is a little weighty, it pulls the earrings down. You don't want to loose them."
4,Swarovski Earrings,"These earrings are very beautiful. They are a tad too long, which is why I rated them a four instead of a five. Overall I am pleased with them, I will wear them when I have to dress up, very pretty."
3,Lovely but box chain is a problem,"These are lovely, but I find that the box chain is: 1) slippery, so it slides around in my ears - and thus the earrings are insecure, & security is the main reason I like threaders - and 2) rather stiff, so that the chain sticks out a bit on either side, looking a bit goofy. Learned my lesson - no box chains on threaders for me."
3,Not as expected,"These are most definitely not made of crystal. The bead is plastic and when it hits the light, it turns all sorts of colors, like children's jewelry. Nonetheless, they are a very lovely style, yet I'm rather disappointed in the quality of the ""crystal"". For only $12.99, they're not too bad."
4,A nice new addition,"I wear this earring a lot since I got it. Received lots of compliments. Elegant and easy to carry. The only thing is somehow they do not stay very well, tend to slide off, so I have to check once a while. Otherwise I would say it is a great pair to have."
2,One-hit Wonder?,"I had recently heard Cornel Campbell's ""King in My Empire"", on XM Radio, and I couldn't find a download, so I decided to buy this CD. Cornel Campbell is great, but the other artist's songs are below par. Some of the songs sound like they were recorded on a cassette deck with lots of hiss.Unless you just absolutely have to own ""King in My Empire"" on a CD, I don't recommend this one."
4,Seiko Men's Automatic Gold Tone watch,"This is a good watch for its price, and it was delivered in time and in perfect condition.We were looking for a water resistant automatic watch and the web info said that the watch is water resistant. However when we receive the watch, we discovered that it is resistant only to splashes and not for shower - it is not to be submerged in the water.The wrist band was short - my husband has average size wrists, but we had to request additional links. I should admit, that the customer service was fast and supportive."
4,JARANDA,"I shopped for a month both on line and in large Department stores before I decided to buy from Amazon. I paid for the fast shipping rate. I was surprised to recieve the watch the next day, less than 24 hours. I like the watch it looks great. This makes my sixth watch for my Seiko collection. The only problem with this watch is the band is too short. I am now looking for extra links to add, so I can wear the watch."
4,Only one minor problem,"Handsome watch, very attractive appearance. Accurate, as are all the Seikos I've owned over the years. Excellent value. Only one minor problem: I can't ""not wear it"" for more than 36 hours! If I do, the watch stops and I have to reset it. Very inconvenient. I go fishing a lot, and I am gone for 2 days at a time (I wear my other, waterproof, Seiko for fishing trips). When I come back, the watch has stopped. Other than this one glitch I'm very happy with it."
3,Wrong,"Iam sure that the item I received was perfectly fine however instead of a data cable for a Sanyo M-300 cell phone, I received a cable for a A-900 phone.This error (and all subsequent errors) was most likely made by the vendor, SF Planet.Needless to say, I was dissappointed.When I finally was able to get an RMA to return it, I sent it off via USPS.One month later I was still waiting for my refund and had to contact the vendor three times before I received my refund."
1,Don't Buy This Item,This item doesn't work. I can't even get Win XP to see it and load drivers. I have a Samsung SGH-X427M phone and Samsung PC Studio. This cable won't work.
3,"Nice, but...","It was everything we could have wanted and we really did love it, but 1)yes, there are 3 alarms: one for CD, one for Radio and one for nature sounds. That's it. You can't switch them around... Can't have two for the CD or anything. 2) the CD starts with the first track no matter what."
2,There are better choices.....,"Too complicated for its own good. I would not recommend this product for an elderly relative that has trouble seeing or using electronic devices with small buttons. It is one of those types of items that you must hold down ""Button A"" while pressing ""Button B"" two times and afterwards pressing ""Button C"" three times just to set the alarm. Sound is typical for a clock radio (one should not expect the sound of a Bose based on the price). The backlit display for time, etc. is easy to read and not harsh on the eyes in a dark bedroom, which is one plus.Overall, after owning this product for a bit, I have to use the words of a leading consumer magazine to sum it up....""There are better choices."""
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!!,"I bought this clock because I am a very light sleeper and most alarm clocks scare me awake. To start, the nature sounds are not realistic and they run on a very short loop. Second, I saw the name ""timex"" and assumed that I was buying a quality product. One day, about 8 months after I bought the clock, I woke up to a screeching sound that wouldn't stop (like fingernails across a chalkboard). I called timex and was told that they did not manufacture this clock and that I needed to call a different company. At this other company, I got no help (the measly 90-day warranty had passed), so I exchanged it at [a local store] for another one (thank goodness I had my receipt) for another one hoping that I got a good one this time. Sorry, no luck that time either: almost a year later, the same thing happened again and I ended up chucking this ... in the trash. Please don't put yourself through the trouble of buying this product."
3,"Really great product, but....","I like the sound quality and the choices of realistic nature sounds, radio or CD to listen to. I like that the display can be dimmed easily if it's too bright. For dependable Timex alarm clock quality, it can't be beat.BUT....1. If you listen to a CD to sleep, you cannot set buzzer for alarm & the CD will play at alarm time. The only way to set buzzer is to not have a CD inserted, and CD/alarm is selected.2. Although the snooze button is big & at the front & center, it's also next to the Alarm Reset button. If you're like me & can go through an hour of snoozes before getting up, you'lll learn this the hard way. I pried the button off with a screwdriver in frustration.3. Although there are plenty of buttons on the front to go with the bells & whistles, the placement isn't entirely intuitive, ie: since they don't light up, it's hard to guess which one is which.But I'm high-maintenance when it comes to mornings, so account for that when weighing my opinion!"
2,OK as an alarm clock. CD player fails early in life,"I purchased this item new at a local electronics store. It functions good as an alarm clock. The CD player is another story. Within the first 6 months the CD player developed problems. Any CD inserted would spin briefly and stop. The display would show ""NO"" for no CD inserted. A CD leanse cleaning gave me a few more months of service. Several times an hour a click is heard in the speakers. This click is soft but can be a little distracting when placed close to the bed. The useful life of this unit appears to be around 1 - 1.5 years. The warranty is poor at only 90 days. This is one Timex product that Can't take a licking and Won't keep on ticking."
1,owl on speed,"I thought this clock would have it all. Unfortunately, I bought the clock mainly for the nature sounds, which are not realistic at all. The ocean sounds are more reminiscent of a leaky faucet than crashing surf, and the forest sounds include an owl hooting just about every eight seconds (not very soothing to me). To top it off, the radio clarity is poor, even for a clock radio. This is one gift that is being returned."
2,Not very good,"This thing is another stupid bedside clock. The unit is so outdated. The sounds are like a cheap unrealistic sound machine with no purpose at all. the radio has a terrible tuner. It's nice looking, but poor quality. It worked for a week and it broke. This is not a good product, spend your money on a better portable radio. this one is not worth anything at all, so avoid this horrible clock."
5,Gorgeous Book,"Truly beautiful coffee table book, with plenty of photos of Chinese furniture. A must-have for anyone who loves Chinese furniture. A bargain at the [low] price!"
4,A Gem,The Nanny is one of those shows that starts out with an outstanding pilot and doesn't let up. The premeire episode clearly identifies every character and lets you know there are plenty of laughs to come... I watched the 1st 6 episodes the day I got it and can't wait to watch the rest... It's complete enjoyment. Watching without the commercials makes the episodes fly by... a real treat!
1,the nanny the first season,I like this dvd set... I love the nanny and it was so much fun to watch the series in order...i have watch all the disk several times and everytime i found something new to laugh at. the 2 voice over ones are great it gives you a little more back ground on the people who played the parts and about them as people not just actors...I can't wait and hope they follow up on the other seasons of the series...i will be the first in line to buy it for me and a set for my daughter.
2,Isn't it convenient for Fran...,"That Mr. Sheffield has a butler, Niles, that takes over the cleaning, cooking, and otherwise the heavy-duty physical work that Fran SHOULD have been doing in a normal household?That the children are so docile and obedient that the most Fran needs to typically do is share a bit of her ""down to earth, warm-hearted wisdom"" for everything to be all right?That Mr. Sheffield doesn't mind the intrusion of all of Fran's relatives into his home?That Mr. Sheffield doesn't mind that his life with Fran is more about him putting up with her goofs than her taking a burden off his shoulder by taking care of the kids?On a positive note, despite some tiny masculinity moments typical to males (except maybe Niles) in this female-oriented show, Brighton didn't turn out to be the cipher ninny I expected him to be. He actually has a few sharp lines. And Niles and CC are pretty funny- they probably save the show.A brainless piece of fluff, and no more."
5,the BEST rerun ever,"I watch this show every day and it is part of my routine before bed. I love Mr. Sheffields and MISS FINE's romance. and the mother is a RIOT. Can't wait to get the DVD. Why this show was over looked I don't know. She is another Lucille Ball.Christine from Hilton, NY"
4,The Nanny on DVD is great!,"The show is so crisp and clear on the DVDs, and it's great for later fans (post 1999) to see the episodes in their entirety, with the bits Lifetime Television cut out for syndication. The interviews with Fran Drescher, her ex-husband and all three children from the show are great, but it's sad that Lauren Lane, Charles Shaughnessy, and Daniel Davis are not included. The commentaries by Fran for three of the episodes are wonderful, it'd be nice if she had done it for more. Hopefully the following seasons will be put out on DVD soon, and a bloopers bit would be great. Overall, I loved it!"
5,The nanny,"I love the nanny first season, I watch it almost everyday. I can't wait till season 2 comes out!"
5,"The more I watch it, the more fun I get","This is great. For a very long time I have been a fan of Fran Drescher and The Nanny is one of my all times favorite shows. I love it. She is really hillarious and I love the show. The DVD collection comes with comments by Fran and I love it. I think she really describes the show well, and her fans.Also, it is nice to learn what has been going on with the rest of the cast. I miss this show, it was such an important part of my TV watching life for so many years. Having the DVD allows me to remember those days and play all over again my favorite episodes.Now, I am looking forward to seeing the show over and over again."
5,Awesome Show!,"""The Nanny"" is one of the best 90's show ever. Fran Drescher and the cast are hilarious and if you enjoy watching comedy shows this one is for you. Also this DVD set has the making of and audio commentary which is nice for ""The Nanny"" fans."
1,NEVER RECEIVED,"I never received this product and I sent an email asking where it was, yet got no response. Could someone please contact me via phone regarding this matter. My number is (513)371-3351."
3,Where is it?,I still have not gotten my product so i am unable to review it. it is almost a month late because of a mistake the company made. im still waiting.....
5,The Seventh Sin,"A fantastic debut novel, a real page-turner. One can only imagine the parallels between the book and the author's real-life experiences in a big law firm. I can hardly wait for Perison's next literary offering."
1,my new Chanukah gift for little ones!,"Great DVD! Very cute! Sesame Street quality entertainment, totally keeps a little ones attention! You won't go wrong with this purchase! I'm so happy with it!"
4,perfect for college student,The book and price was perfect for college student... The book was expressed ordered and came within 3 days from the time ordered till received.
5,Nice looking and sturdy,"I bought one of these stands when it was on sale as part of the ""Friday Sale"". It hasn't tipped over, yet! I waited and saw the price drop again and bought another one to replace another stand that tipped over a couple times a month.The 40lbs is sufficient to keep the 9ft market umbrellas from tipping over on windy days. It's attractive, too."
3,Needs better packaging for shipment,I suppose this would be a nice product if I could receive one intact. Unfortunately Amazon will not send me just a replacement hand screw to replace the broken one(s) that have apparently been broken during shipment when the heavy box was dropped on one side on the unprotected plastic screws. The screws seem be substantial enough as long as they do not have a 40# base dropped on them.I write this as I send my second one back asking for a refund. Amazon has been very good about dealing with the problem so far.
3,Mildly Entertaining but Overrated,"I ordered this book because it was described as a cross between Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. However, while it is somewhat entertaining, it isn't half as inventive or vivid as Harry Potter's world, nor is Tucker half as interesting or appealing a character as Harry himself. As far as it being similar to Tolkien's work--not even close.I suspect that the book was self-published; I certainly have never seen so many typographical and punctuation errors in a single book in my life. This book could have benefitted greatly from a good proofreader.I also suspect that the writer is young in years; I found ""Prophecy of the Stones"" by Flavia Bujor superior to this effort, and the author wrote it at the age of 15.While the average youngster (8-10 years) is likely to enjoy this book, I would not recommend it for older readers. This author has potential but the work is not near the standards ascribed to it at this point."
3,Really?,"Quite a nicely written novel indeed. Yet it is full of inaccuracies about time-lines and events. A recommendable read, though, for entertainment purpose."
4,Above and Beyond,Great. Kept interest and moving at all times. These types of books interest me because this happened in my era.
4,Bay area jazz group,"""We aim to envelop our listeners with a pure blend of electric jazz, a deep groove, and some alien vibration."" That nicely nails it. I can't do a better description.Tom Lattanand - Guitar, VocalsMitch Marcus - Tenor Saxophone, RhodesSylvain Carton - Alto and Soprano Saxophone, Guitar, FluteParker Daggett - Drum KitAndrew McIntyre - BassJohn Merrill - Percussion, Didjeridoo, ToysNot sure how I stumbled across this Bay area group exactly. They must have gone on to other ventures because there are just two albums under the name. It is the sort of thing that has its own category. There is Jazz and a strong beat, horns, and organ sounds with sometimes a latin sound. Anyways it is wonderful. Almost dtp, almost rock, almost jazz. This sounds best at night. Never strident or forced. It has a real flow."
4,Good Book,"This book is one of the few books that i have come across that covers the XML structures of the Web-Services so In-depth. Most of the other books starts of directly with the programming aspects. But in this book, there is a very detailed explanation of the SOAP, WSDL and UDDI structures. Such thorough explanation helps any programmer to get a very good understanding on the XML centric architecture of the Web Services framework. The most useful part of the book is the running theory of how web services works.Also the book does not try to cover too many things at the same time. The simple approach taken by the authors to keep simple things seperate from the more complex APIs provides good advantage to the readers to understand webservices very easily. Probably the authors should come-out with a Volume 2 of the book, which should cover other complex APIs.All in all a very good reading material...."
5,Good Explanations,"Though the book has obsolete code, the explanations in the book are very clear and helpful. I guess the authors released the book too early. The webservices APIs are ever changing and is not yet finalized. Either ways, this book is very good for beginners like me."
2,"Took the ""Afro"" out of Afropop","Horrid pop music. Watered down anti-mbalax rock that sullies the good name of Youssou N'dour. Granted this version is SLIGHTLY better than its original form/release (Joko: From Village to Town)- but make no mistake this was produced to appeal to Western sensibilies, abandons most attributes of senegalese Afropop (mbalax), leaving trite English lyrics, downbeat accented, unpolyrhythmic pop music more akin to Peter Gabriel than other N'dour albums. Recommened instead areNdour's ""Best of 80's"" & Rough Guide to Youssou N'dour & Etoile de Dakar"", and Thione Seck/Raam Daan's ""Live Aniversary."""
5,un buen y esperado reencuentro,este cd de youssou n'dour marca el regreso de una de las figuras mas destacadas de la musica ( no solo africana) con matices todas las canciones son superlativas. Para escuchar entero uno y otra vez. No cae en bajones ritmicos o musicales. Su nivel es 5 estrellas en la totalidad. Para quienes no han oido aun a youssou n'dour esta es una excellente chance. Los demas saben de que les hablo
3,Good but not Great,"I think Youssou N'Dour is losing his edge a bit. His last few albums have been decent but nowhere near as good as ""Set"" and ""Eyes Open"", where there is not a weak track to be found. His more recent stuff is more uneven and a bit too ""pop"", in my opinion."
3,only 20,"I had bought this tea at TJ Maxx and loved the flavor. That box had 50 bags though. I should have read the description better, These boxes only have 20 bags, making this not that great a deal, although it is very good tea."
5,Unkunvenshunal Girl,The cd is Josie's best work ever. I have been listening to her since she was a youngster. Her range and style is exceptional. I've heard her sing mostly ballads but this new style sets her far apart from the everyday artist you hear today. I wish her all the best for a successful career. She has worked very hard and deserves all the opportunities that are ahead for the future.
1,Whiney words,"I thought her songs sounded like a whiney version of Mandy Moore. Even though her lyrics were very positive, I felt like the tunes of the song with the lyrics just didn't flow. Every song sounds the same and she doesn't bring anything new to the music scene. All in all, we've heard this before from everyone else in a less obnoxsious tone."
5,Truly Amazing,Just a little note to say how truly amazing and well put together this album is. I LOVE it!! Josie is obviously VERY talented from the sounds of her music and lyrics. I am excited to hear and see more from Josie in the future!!!
4,comfortable,"I've had this pair of shoes for couple years now. It's one of my favorites as it is very comfortable to walk on any surfaces; it breathes well so my feet do not feel hot. After couple years of heavy use the shoes still hold up quite nicely. The shoe laces come loose quite easily, though.Overall, very pleased with this purchase."
4,Good advice and Better Receipes,"I love ""diet"" books and decided to read this one after completing similiar types of books from the French and Japanese perspective. I think this is the best of the three I have approached so far.Like the other lifestyle diet books, Kelly focuses on eating what pleases you and making better choices. I, however, found her tips (except for eating fish) much easier to follow. She also did not come across as pretentious as some of the other aforementioned books.Her reciepies are flavorful and easy to follow and her suggestions on organic markets (websites as well) is useful. I have developed a new fondness for organic/greek style yogurt.This isn't really a diet book. It is promoting a lifestyle based on cooking for yourself and eating fresh foods. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and think Kelly does have good advise. I would definitely recommend this over the other ""lifestyle diet"" books."
4,"Good book, great recipes","I read everything I can get my hands on regarding the Mediterranean lifestyle. This book is well written, although, if you have read other books on the subject, there is not a lot of new information. For me, the real value in the book is the recipes. I try to eat this way and I am always looking for sources of recipes. The recipes here are interesting and good"
5,Ensure - A Great Product,"I buy this for my Dad who is 90 years old. I started him on Ensure for the fiber, but it has proven to be very beneficial to his well-being. He has a some health problems, and since he started taking Ensure, his general health improved a great deal. I was having a hard time finding the Choc. Ensure with Fiber in my area, which is why I now purchase it through Amazon. This is a blessing, it is cheaper, I order more than I would buy at a store, and it's delivered right to my door with free shipping. A quality product purchased from a great company. Thank you!"
5,Great Book,"In a world of dangerous fad diets ,an endless stream of snake oil supplements and ""quick fix"" workout programs, Owen's book is a breath of fresh air. The book provides clear and detailed information on his nutritional guidelines and training techniques. This book also stresses the importance of discipline, consistency and mental preparation to overcome the obstacles into achieving longterm physical health. His story will inspire you."
3,"Highly Motivational, but Lacking ""Average Joe Photos""","I use ""Body for Life"" for technique and motivation; I use ""Cover Model Workout"" for even more motivation. Since I can't rate this ""3.5 stars"", I've rounded down to ""3 stars""; I feel that books such as ""Men's Health Belly-Off Program"" and ""Body for Life"" have significantly raised the bar for health/fitness program books by showing many before-and-after photos of Average Joe's who've followed the program. ""Cover Model Workout"" mainly shows pictures of Owen McKibbin in perfect shape, who is the centerpiece of the book. If the program works, then the book should be able to present before-and-after photos of Average Joe's, while still presenting Owen McKibben as the developer/inspiration/philosopher behind the program who lends it credibility via his career and accomplishments. I'd like to see a second edition of ""Cover Model Workout"" with a large number of before-and-after photos of those who followed this program!"
3,Interesting but not destined to be a classic,"I enjoy reading mafia history and have a fair collection of books on the subject. This one covers an individual I have not read much about and I enjoyed the book from that standpoint but, on the whole, I was not especially impressed. There are plenty of really bad books in the 'true crime' genre and it would be unfair to put this book in that category, but it is too short and disorganized to be judged very good either. The book very much reads as a slightly puffed up magazine article and the author jumps around a lot in a haphazard fashion. I would like to read more about Massino after reading this book, but I would prefer something a bit more substantial."
1,What's worse than a CD full of crap? Three CDs full of crap!,"If you like salsa avoid this like the plague. For one thing there are no real horns, which I suppose might be okay if there were other real instruments to replace them, but it's all synthesized (if there are any real instruments they are well buried in the mix). The singing is bad too. To add insult to injury this ""Hot Salsa"" compilation contains a number of merengue and latino-pop songs, which again might be okay if they weren't so abysmally performed. If you want a salsa compilation, look elsewhere for one with tracks by the original artists."
3,Wish I could review it.,I would love to review this book.. but I have not received it yet. Three months later and I still don't have my order. Wow what service.
5,A grand adventure!!!,"Once started, you just can't put it down. This is one of those books that lends itself for reading more than once, have already read it a couple of times!!! New things come into light each time I read the novel. Packaged within this suspenseful and intriguing novel is a skillfully crafted spiritual, mystical AND philosophical content. It is an exciting AND delightful adventure at all levels (mind and soul)."
5,Insightful and impacting,"Written like a screenplay shifting between numerous dramatic stories of personal struggle to survive, this book held my interest from page one to the end. The revelation of the details of the communication problems and the building's engineering flaws changed the way I view any building I enter whether high or low rise. I highly recomend this book to all who want or need to remember the true impact of the 9/11 attack on ordinary American citizens living their everyday lives."
4,Deeply touching memoir of a horrible moment in history,"When the twin towers fell, it was a moment that was seared into memory. I watched the news footage and cried for the losses of so many. But it is impossible to understand the terror that so many endured until you read this book. As the occupants of the towers are introduced, you feel that you know these people,that they could be the person who works next to you each day. Then once the planes hit, you follow them as they try to reach safety or accept their fate and perish. I was very moved. There is some criticism of the Fire and Police Departments for failing to cooperate more effectively but their heroism is never questioned. I would recommend this book but keep the tissues handy."
4,Gripping Account from Inside the Twin Towers,"As we all watched the images of the towers collapse on 9/11 (and over and over again in the media thereafter) we couldn't help but think about what it was like for those trapped inside. This book takes us into the towers on 9/11 with the people who were there. It shows us that on that day ordinary people became heroes, sometimes losing their lives in the process. The book also examines the fire department response and offers a glimpse into the surreal as firefighters rest on lower floors of the towers not knowing that pausing there would mean death. I would recommend this book for a detailed account from inside the towers, with a caution that it is intense reading. My only criticism of the book is in how it is organized, while each chapter has a time stamp and tower location, I found it hard to keep track of the people from chapter to chapter."
4,incorrect photo caption,"Heartbreaking story that needed to be told. I have avoided 9/11 books because I wasn't ready to relive that period. 102 minutes is the drama of those who persevered as long as they could, intertwined with those of greater fortune, and those heroes who risked everything to help.No blame. No politics.When you look at the very first photo in the photo section, Bill Kelly is on the right, Pete Alderman behind him and Chris Hanley is the dapper guy on the left. Chris worked for a division of Reuters, Bill and Pete worked for Bloomberg. The caption leaves Chris out, refers to Chris as Bill and Bill as Pete. God bless them all."
3,Accurate or not,"I have not read a lot of books about the demise of the Twin Towers but this book does seem to put the events into a very easy to follow account of the day. I have no idea if it's true or not but it does leave out a lot. Basically it's an account of the events in the order they happened so the book jumps back and forth between the buildings. If you want to read a shorter version of that day, this book is good. If you want details, this books probably won't fill in all the things you want to know about what happened."
3,Breakneck pace. Good Insights,"A few good things about the book: It runs at a breakneck pace. The 102 minutes are so vivid and full of panic and chaos that this books turns out to be a compulsive page turner. The additional insights regarding Port Authority standards for skyscrapers and what was disgustingly lacking in the two most prestigious business centers of the world, are truly eye openers.What this books lacks is tying everything together. In order to highlight the facts the book introduces so many characters that it becomes a bit difficult to keep track, especially when the mind is totally not able to concentrate on anything but the events going inside the two towers.Also, if there could have been a mention of a few things that administration decided in order to prevent these things in future, e.g. design issues, coordination or police and fire department, or a few recommendations, this could have been a complete work.This subject had a lot of potential than just being a narration."
5,excellent,"This is the best book I've read about 9/11. Well researched, well written, tells all, almost like your there. I recommend this book highly!"
4,Gripping!,"Gripping, riveting, heartbreaking! Vividly takes the reader inside the twin towers on that awful day and lets you experience the unfolding drama with lots of first-hand and eyewitness accounts, even from many who did not make it out (via calls to 911, family, and friends). You become invested in all of the civilians and service professionals throughout the book, and it's heart-wrenching to realize who did not make it out."
5,A wonderful tribute to the victims and survivors.,"Written with compassion, dignity and absolute authority, this wonderful book is an apt tribute to all of the people, living and dead, who experienced the horror of that day. It also sounds an alarm for the planners and creators of super-structures meant to house thousands of workers and visitors. While perhaps no sane person could have predicted what occurred on 9/11, the reality of the times we now live in requires that any and all steps need to be taken in order to minimize the chances for results similar to what occurred on that day. This book leaves no doubt that mercenary decisions made nearly 40 years ago contributed greatly to a situation in which people who should have escaped did not. We all know what happened from an outside perspective. Now read this book if you want to understand what hell is like from the inside."
5,Gripping Minute by Minute Account,"This is the sort of book you can't put down because you want to see what happens, even though you already know. I found myself flipping back to the appendix of people mentioned over and over again to determine who died and who survived."
3,Some of the Story,"A pretty good job which gathers a reasonable chunk of information about what happened in those terrible minutes.However, I am aware of many other experiences that were left out: both survivors and non-survivors. They focussed on some great heroes and rightly critiqued some of the response.will we see one on the Pentagon?"
2,An interesting but jumbled mess,"While this book gives a lot of detail about what transpired on 9/11 and the writers clearly did their research, it reads like a very rough draft. I think their goal should have been to clarify what happened on that chaotic day not simply taken notes and then publish it. So many, many typos- was it even edited? Overall, a disappointment because the material is there, it just needs editing."
1,Horrible Read,"Unlike the title; 102 minutes: The Fight to Survive inside of the Twin Towers, it should more likely be said that it is a fight to survive to finish this book. This book offers a poor dramatization and should be condemned. I was very disappointed in the quality of the writing and found this book to be utterly painful. The only high point in this book was its ending for exactly why it was. It ended. I do not recommend this book to anybody and feel that anyone would be wasting his or her time by reading this. Don't get me wrong; I have complete respect for those who lost their lives and those who fought to save them. It's just that this book offers nothing. A whole chapter spent on the different foam linings used to insulate and fireproof the building doesn't make for a non-stop page turning, ""edge of your seat"" read. Don't waste your time and be sorry you even thought about reading this!"
5,Least we forget!,"This book takes the reader inside the twin towers in a way that brings to light the hell it was for those inside, that the press never reported. Gives you a whole new perspective on what we're at war against and a deep appreciation for those who risked and sacrificed everything for something that goes way beyond courage. Every American should read this book so that we never forget."
5,An unreal story,This was a hard book to read. You knew it happened and so many lives were lost but some were saved. It goes to show that the departments of the police and the fireman needed to work together and did not. I would recommend this book.
3,Just OK,"I enjoyed the book, but it was pretty cut and dry. I wish the survivors would have told some of the story."
3,Important documentation of the early events of 9/11,"1. My 3 star rating doesn't mean that this isn't a good book. Rather, it's a very worthwhile book for all of those interested in the events surrounding 9/11. It's just a fairly cut / dry documentation of what went on in initial 102 minutes. Like some of the other reviewers noted, I wished it was actually longer, with more detail etc..."
3,Compelling... but,"Obviously, this is compelling and wrenching material. But - this would have made a great article: as a book... it's too long. Ultimately, it loses some of its strength by its length. I'm glad I read it. And I recommend it. But this would have been a great New Yorker piece."
3,not the best but works..,"spend more money if you want a qaulity whisper mute. Overall it works OK, but not as quiet as more expensive ones."
5,Great Product,"To the guy who said he couldn't get Yankee Candle's tart to melt in a ""Scentsy"" warmer it's no fault of the Yankee Candle. Scentsy wax is designed differently, it's designed to melt quickly using less heat. They're not meant to be interchangeable. Get a traditional tart burner and you'll be all set. User error should not warrant a poor review for this product."
1,Not Impressed,"I love this scent (Midsummers Dream) from Yankee Candle. I am a man and to me and my lady it is a manly scent. However, purchased these to use in my two Scentsy warmers (yeah I am a man and I like Scentsy, the Angler and Shale are pretty cool). Anyways, I do not know if it is the bulb not allowing the cake to get warm enough or if I keep my house to cool (no probs with the weathered leather Scentsy wax tho), but these cakes do not melt well. ALSO go to Yankee Candle's web site and order from them direct. They are LOTS CHEAPER!!! I have Amazon Prime, and at Yankee, they are STILL cheaper after shipping."
5,Excellent,"Tongue-in-cheek cool. Playfully kinky. This lady deserves a big ol' hit...and this just might be the one. One of the finest, unheralded singers that Music City has produced. Come on and jump on the bandwagon now!!"
5,A Wonderful Reference,"I originally picked this book up at the library while taking a class on herbal medicine and was so impressed with it that I bought a copy. It contains clear and concise information on a variety of ailments with not only the herbal remedies but also their drug counterparts. There are ""recipes"" for herbal mixtures for some of the ailments. This is a book that will be referred to time and time again."
5,Very helpful and handy reference book,"Bought several books on herbal and natural medicines, but this is the only book that I always refer to when in need. Very practical and handy. As other reviewers mentioned, this book has the content well organized and very precise."
5,A Fabulous Anthology from Ellora's Cave,"TAKEN is a fantastic grouping of three quickies from the Preditors & Editors publisher of the year Ellora's Cave. You will find all three of these stories perfect for a taste from these outstanding authors as the 'quickie' from Ellora's Cave was created just for that reason - a small taste to see if you like and trust me you will!The first is 'Dementia' from Jaid Black and part of her Trek Mi Q'an series.Second is 'Dragon's Mistress' from Joanna Wylde and is also part of her futuristic series. In fact this is the first one I tried of Ms Wylde's and I was instantly hooked.'Too Hot to Handle' by Shelby Morgen is the third title in this anthology and is in her Way of the Wolf series.All three are written to be read separately or in sequence [your preference] - although, if you haven't tried any or one of these series you will find yourself in a quandry of where to start first - they are that unique and thrilling of a read."
3,Ok but not worth the money,"The first story is ok, easy read and fast pace. The others are more slow and less interesting but still ok. What annoys me the most is how short the book is...very large font to make it look like a longer read. I read the whole thing is less than 2 hours. At the end I was thinking...hmm and I paid $14.oo for that?"
3,pretty good book,"dementia by jaid black and dragon's mistress were both very good stories. however way of the wolf by shelby morgan left a lot to be desired. the story to me, let a lot to be desired. jaid black, who is a very talented writer, started strong with her book that takes place in her trek mi q'an. dementia is the best story of the book."
2,3 year olds,"Easy to install software, but unfortunately too easy for the age range. My son is 5. He mastered this software completely including the bonus games in 2 days. He is now bored, not a good thing for a 5 year old. Buy the Stuart Little software instead, it's challenging and keeps the attention."
4,"okay, but a little boring",I bought this for my 7 year old daughter & she quickly bored of it. It's not that it's a BAD game...just didn't hold her interest for long.
4,Vivid Imagination,The most striking aspect of this book is the vivid descriptions the author comes up with to describe the characters and events. The story itself is disjointed at times but my overall impression was positive due to the colorful imagery and imaginative plot twists. I can't wait to see what the author has in store for us in the future!
2,data structures,"I used this book as a text book for a data structures class. The code does work but the code structure hard to follow. As a supplement a book written by Kruse was used to fill the gap this one left. I would not add this one to my library. Also I am not a 12 year old reader, the input box would not go above 12."
1,very bad,This is the worst programming text book I've encountered. The examples may work but are far from readable.
2,Awesomely beautiful novice cello but not for the sound.,"Length:: 0:31 MinsI purchased this as used from one of the seller, but when we received it, I was pleasantly shocked how beautiful this cello is in person. The color of the body is a bit darker in person, and the bow that came with it was beautiful dark burgundy color with goldish tone accent. It came with very well-padded soft carrying case with backpack straps with lots of pockets for rosin, music sheets or whatever. HOWEVER, the sound is another story. It's a great novice cello for your very beginner kids who just started, but just that as the sound quality may interfere the skill development. I uploaded a clip here for you to hear the sound. Previously I left a fab feedback, but I replaced with this review after I realized the sound quality of this cello is sub-standard compared to some instruments such as cello at public schools."
5,Spiritual and Sensual,I think the title says it all. This cd is both a spiritual experience and a spiritual one. I love to listen to it with my partner.
5,SOOPER COOl,this cd is just soopercool. its just sooper diddly dooper cool. I would buy it for $400 if i had to. ITs just that sooper cool
4,Good Read,I would recommend to anyone who has to make major decisions about academic programs. Book contains many useful tips and advice.
5,Excellent book for institutional leaders,"Well written and very helpful in understanding how to go about the task of prioritizing academic programs, a highly sensitive process on ony college or university campus."
5,"Awesome and exciting reading here, folks!","This debut novel by these two writers made me want more afterwards.If you liked the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen movie - then you'll absolutely go ga-ga over this. Engaging characters and excellent world-building.A must read. Lordy, Hollywood, make a movie of this why don't you?!"
4,Where oh where to begin,"At first I was a little hesitant to pick this up, there is, in my mind, a ling line of collaborations with but a few shining starts among them, but Goldens prior work got the better of me. I am so glad I got this.At first it was your run of the mill supra-natural super powered thriller, the end is known but in these it all about the journey. And then the writing came shining through. I meant to read a single chapter the night I finished this book! But alas I could not.The chapters leave off like cliff hangers forcing you to read the next one and then the next and you have no choice but to keep plowing through and then Bam! You are done.The characters could have used a little more, Clay would be a phenomenal stand alone as well as Doyle's love life. But all in all the mix is perfect, a perfect fit to eat a night of your life and leave you wishing and begging for the second, and a third and with luck a whole complimentary for many years."
5,The Nimble Man's LXG!!,"The Nimble Man, Book # 1 of The Menagerie, was a great choice for me to read.From the first page to the last, the action and adventure never let up. If you liked the League of Extrodinary Gentlemen comic or movie, then you will certainly enjoy this colorful novel.Led by the sorceror Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, The Menagerie team battles awesome forces of darkness quite unique from anything I've read before. From vampires to elementals to hobgoblins to shapeshifters, THE NIMBLE MAN has that and so much more to offer for hours of reading enjoyment.Fresh and ever-growing characters abound in this debut 1st novel, partly written from the author who wrote the famous and great Shadow Saga. These two writers seem to blend beautifully together, and I for one, will be looking forward to purchasing the next installment.Hollywood, please make this into a movie!"
2,Don't Do It.,"I purchased this CD yesterday and I'm kicking myself for doing it. Yes, it's moody, and yes it's nice and depressing, but it's just so dissident. We are lacking in containing any sort of melody here. Please, do yourself a favor and check out Keith Jarrett's 'The Melody At Night, With You'. This is so much more soothing and it still contains that great depressing feeling you get from Brad. In short, you are choosing between being depressed and relaxed or depressed and agitated. It's your choice."
4,Go somewhere,"Another unfiltered lesson in melodic elegance, Places perhaps capped off the endlessly calculating and catapulting pianist's most compelling period to date, offering the best of both hauntingly solo and fluidly captivating trio works."
5,Funny and entertaining,As always this is another great and funny offering from Brent Burns. I espicially like Santa's gone NASCAR and Another White Christmas.
1,Biggest bunch of crooks,Biggest bunch of crooks the phone worked for two days then the battery died. I called the customer support a number of times of a four month period and each time they tell me they will send me a new a battery and then they tell me its out of stock for the next few months. They just continue to give me the run around.Don't buy anything form this company bunch of crooks.
3,New taste leaves a chalky after taste,"I have been drinking Ensure for the last 10 years. My favorite is the chocolate served over ice. I always have one before I go to bed in the evening and sometimes one for lunch. Recently I bought some and noticed that it says new great taste. Well, I have to disagree to the point I don't know if I can keep drinking it. It leaves a chalky after taste in my mouth. That was one of my main reasons why I liked it. It didn't leave that awful after taste like some of the other drinks did. Besides that it is a great nutritional drink.Please bring back the great taste that was there. Thank you!"
2,Ensure had a very odd taste to it ...,"Ensure had a very odd taste to it -- kind of an alcohol aftertaste that I disliked. After drinking a couple, the taste did grow on me. They didn't seem to give me energy. Compared to drinking Slim Fast, I liked that there was much less sugar in Ensure, but I overall, I don't think they are worth the extra expense. Way overpriced in my opinion."
2,The product tastes good and has some nutritional ...,"The product tastes good and has some nutritional value. The largest drawback is the fat (6g) to protein (9g) ratio. This fits the needs of some people, but if your goal is a low fat diet, there may be other products that are better suited for you. The premix makes the drink easy to take on the road, and this is a substantial advantage . I'd recommend this product to people based on their nutritional needs."
2,Sound Quality is Poor,I like the size and other features but the playback sound quality is so poor that you have to very intently listen to understand what you said. I am going to get rid of it.
4,A nifty little gadget,"I usually remember something important or have some great idea while I'm in my car, but I don't want to try to write it down while I'm driving (too dangerous).This little voice balloon hangs from my rear view mirror and lets me record these ideas until I can get home and write them down.I've been using it a couple of weeks now and it has been very handy. You can record up to 99 seperate messages (or up to 12 minutes), which is plenty for me. It's very easy to use while you're driving...just push the big button, talk, and push the big button again when your done."
4,Great value!,"The Sony Balloon is a great buy. I use it to record brief memos (phone numbers, appointments, etc), and then pass them on to my Palm. Sure, the sound could be better, but it is good enough for you to understand what you've recorded quite well. For $50, it's a great buy, and you may want to consider a PDA to go with it (I recommend palm). If you have more serious recording needs (ie transcriptions, etc.) you may want to consider something else."
3,A little disappointed,"After reading the reviews I was expecting a lot of great photos but was a little disappointed as some of the photos were just average, especially when compared to some of the other photography books. The book is a bit to heavy and large for general reading. Otherwise the reviews are close to the mark."
5,I love this camera,"This is my first digital camera so I really have nothing to compare it to. I did some research before buying though. My sister wanted me to get a Sony brand but after reading the reviews on this Canon I decided to try this one instead. It's been real easy to use. I've taken hundreds of pictures and I am thrilled with the results. Everyone who see the pictures on-line say they are great. The batteries that came with the camera died within 2 days. I bought recharable batteries & I've had the same batteries in for 3 weeks now & haven't need to recharge them. I am home all day with kids, so I'm constantly grabing the camera to take pictures. One suggestion I have it to get a soft pouch or case for it to prevent the screen from getting scratched when your traveling with it."
5,Great camera for the amateur photographer,"I took this camera with me to Nepal last fall. I came back with some fantastic pictures, easily rivaling professional photos in many cases. The resolution and colors are great. I would recommend this camera for any amateur photographer who wants a point-and-shoot camera that delivers great shots."
2,Cheap camera but very noisy,"Professionally, I am an imaging engineer and my area of expertise is image quality. I've been a long time Canon fan, and after my A80 broke, I bought the A570IS without even doing any comparison or research. But when I got it, I was disappointed to see that the pictures turn out to be quite noisy! Even with the flash on, indoor photos tend to show quite a lot of grain. The flash recharge time is also quite slow.On the positive side, the image stabilization works quite nicely, and is definitely a good plus. The white balance and the tone are also quite nice.Anyway, you get what you pay for, but I did not expect such a low-quality camera from Canon.To me, the image quality was so poor that I had to return my camera."
5,Excellent !!!,The Canon Powershot A570 IS is a phenomenal camera. Complies with all that and more promises. Its image stabilizer and its face detection of the camera makes a great performance at a price very good.
4,Great Camera!,"Mi first camera, and is a nice one!. Easy to use, easy to navigate. Great quality in the pictures. Im very happy with this purchase!"
2,Batteries Batteries and more Batteries,I was so excited to get the camera and very let down after the first week of usage. I had to carry double A batteries every where I went. I was constantly replacing them. I missed some very important shots because of low batteries causing a delay in the shutter speed.The zoom is extremely week and creates grainy pictures. A digital zoom is needed. I am returning this product and puchasing the sd870IS by canon.
2,Sent It Back Today,"The pictures were great but I constantly kept getting ""replace battery"" messages even with brand new batteries in the camera. Every time the message showed up, I would have to open and close the battery door to make it go away so I could take more pictures. There is a blog on Amazon about this problem. I decided to return it and go with a Panasonic instead."
2,Battery connection problems,"I got this camera as a gift about 4 years ago when I wanted to upgrade from the basic film cameras. About a year in, it started to have battery problems. I even bought rechargeable batteries. No matter what I did, even constantly inserting fresh batteries, the camera would not recognize the power. I inserted a small piece of paper behind the connection point on the batter cover and it only made it fractionally better. I have always been disappointed with its battery life.When the camera did work the pictures were amazing. The zoom was incredible. Nice crisp clear pictures of really distant objects. Its about the width of 2 iphones and has a length of a standard flip phone. Its a little bulkier than some of the other cameras on the market, but it is still able to fit in a pocket.Look somewhere else for camera. The picture quality was nice, but if you can't get the camera on most of the time, the picture quality doesn't mean anything."
3,unexplored star,"I have had this camera only a few weeks and used it a little. It is not as intuitive as I expected and seems to use battery life very fast. The range of features is wonderful, but so far little used by me."
2,Battery life sucks - need rechargeable batteries,"We traded from a Nikon with a charger that had a pretty long battery life to this one that uses AA batteries. I thought that I saw reviews that said the battery life was pretty good, but we have gone through 3 or 4 pairs already in a month and a half and don't even use it that much. We went through one pair in just one trip to the Wild Animal Park and we probably only took about 40 pics. I'm going to research rechargeable batteries so that we don't have to add a separate line item to the budget for batteries each month."
3,Missing Old Camera's Features,"I was excited to finally own a CANON. However my 4 yr. old Sony 3.2 megapixels Cyber-shot has features that I'm not finding on the CANON. Such as the date stamp, zooming and trimming a picture before downloading. As I understand it, you can't zoom when you're in ""postcard"" setting before taking a picture. Altho there's a good possibility I don't understand the instruction book. That happens a lot."
2,Defective :(,"I had high hopes with the IS and 1600iso, but I think we got a defective copy:- The shutter button had to be pressed very hard to take a photo.- There was a lot of shutter lag when it did press.- Flash recharge was very slow.- All photos blurry.Maybe the IS or chip was defective.I returned it for an A560 (also 1600iso), which takes GREAT photos out-of-the-box, for my daughter to use in Europe this summer, hence the preference for a AA battery model.Otherwise, I've had very reliable cameras from Canon (slr and point-n-shoot)."
1,thumbs down,"No matter how much some of the other reviewers brag on this camera, just read the complaints about how fast it uses up batteries. That makes it a big ""NO THANKS"" in my book."
2,A Cheap Ok Camera,"I bought the Canon A570IS to replace my broken Canon A80.The Canon A80 was a perfect camera. I had no complaints. Ihave taken thousands and thousands and thousands of photos both for work,as well as personal and I can say the A80 is a great camera.It is presently at the Canon repair facility, and hopefully it willbe repaired, SOON !!!!The Canon A570IS is a cheap camera. OK, to use for the price,but a cheap camera.My major complaint is the amount of time it takes torefresh the flash. This time is too long and is horrible.If you plan to buy this camera, look at somethingdifferent, a different Canon model or a different manufacture.The Canon A570IS is NOT a replacement for the Canon A80.Over and out,DC"
4,A570 IS - Great Pics - needs the right batteries,"This camera takes great pictures without the flash. With the flash in auto mode, it sometimes over exposes. Requires you to have Eneloop or other type of slow discharge NIMH batteries, otherwise it drains batteries very quickly. Note: You have to have a good charger - I've got a great one by Maha that tops off the batteries nicely. Quick chargers don't get the batteries to their full charge very well.Love the camera, especially for the price."
4,Happy purchaser!,"I've had the camera for two months, and prior to that we had a Kodak DX6490 that we had long been happy with, but we dropped it and thus forced a new puchase. So much of my review is comparing to the previous camera. The low light performance is good, but the flash takes a while to refuel. This is a problem with taking a picture of our two toddlers. However, the pictures that go off are always good quality. I like the camera because it consistently takes great pictures, focuses on the faces automatically, is very easy to use, and has a great LCD display. It does eat up batteries, so you'll want to invest in some rehargeable AA's. But overall, I would re-purchase the camera if I had to do it again."
4,Excellent Camera,"It is compact and gives me pictures of high quality. In Night mode, there is a considerable time gap between two snaps. One must be prepared for that with this model. I dont think it is a drawback with it. In A series, it is one of the best cameras."
3,Is it realy compatable with windows vista ?,"Canon PowerShot A570IS 7.1MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized ZoomOn my computer, windows vista did not recognise the camera ( failure of installing the driver ). I tried the help from canon technical support but they could not help and told me that the problem is in my computer not in the camera."
5,Excellent Price -Quality relationship,"A friend called me and told me about this camara and i bought it. It was an excellent purchase, works great and gave me wonderfulls pictures..."
3,Canon powershot a570IS,Good camera but batteries don't last at all. Seems like it drains batteries on its own. Every time I pick up the camera the batteries are dead. I have rechargeable batteries and I have to carry two extra sets with me.
5,Easy to use,I am very pleased with my Canon PowerShot A579IS. I do not have steady hands and have had great pictures with my camera. The camera is very easy to use and I highly recommend it.
5,"Great Pics, easy to use","I have had this camera for about 2 weeks now, I got it out and clicking photos in 3 minutes.It is very easy to use, easy to carry in your pocket.It is so easy to use, now my 3 year old son is clicking photos too !"
2,It takes Noisey Pictures,"This camera replaced my Sony DSC-W7. The picture quality in the Canon A570IS are noticibly worse. Outdoors, it's fine. But indoors, the pictures are too noisey. The ISO in automatic is too high. But I find that by setting the camera to ""P"" mode, and then setting the ISO to 80 or 100, the indoor pictures are reasonable. Still not as good as the old Sony, I wish they still made that old camera, the new Sony point and shoots are too small for me. This Canon feels good to use - right sized."
5,Very good camera...,I have purchased three of these cameras as gifts and have had NO complaints! Simple to use; plenty of features; easy to hold; BOTH 2.5 inch screen AND viewfinder (great for bright days). They produce excellent pictures!
3,You get what you pay for,"I received the camera a few days ago and I am not thrilled with it. The price was great but if I had been at a regular store and tried the camera, I probably wouldn't have bought it. I was surprised that the quality is bad coming from Canon. The camera when you hold it feels like a toy camera and sounds like one too. The screen is kind of fuzzy. The delay between pictures is long. Definitely buy it with a 2 GB memory card and rechargeable batteries."
4,Great pictures but a power hog,I have had this camera for a bit now and have used it for both video and standard pictures. The quality of the pictures is far greater then any camera I have ever owned. I took a picture of one of my computer case fans (spinning at about 3000rpm) and the picture came out with the fan looking as though it was off! No blur or anything. I was rather amazed. It has a nice zoom and goes up to 16x digital zoom for those far shots. I've had a couple of far ones get some blur but for the most part everything comes out looking great. The only issue I have is that it eats up it's power source. This thing drained the batteries that came with it in just a couple hours of use (maybe 20 photo's and 2 minutes of video time+reviewing the photo's and option setting) And the next pair I put in died just as fast. Though these are standard batteries. All in all though it's a great camera.
4,Great for the money,"This is a great value camera for the money. We took it to Thailand and enjoyed it. I recommend you only use the NiMH batteries in it because it burns through others too quickly. So that gives you another thing to carry, a recharger and spares. If you have to carry these things why does the AA battery advantage matter? In theory a great idea in reality not really a solution. Another big issue was shooting wildlife. The long focus times met missing special moments. You are at the whim of the recharge cycle time. (I don't know what to call this.) This isn't a problem when shooting people for some reason."
2,Really disappointing camera,"I have a canon S3 IS and can say it is a really good camera. Based on my experienced with my S3 IS and reading some reviews I decided to give this A570IS camera to my wife.I bought the first one some time ago and it arrived dead. I returned it and decided not to buy another A570IS one, but considering good reviews here in Amazon I decided to give a second tryThe second one works (I guess) fine, but, I doesn't work with NiMh rechargeable batteries. The same batteries working with my Canon S3 IS doesn't work with this A570IS. Batteries going fully charged directly from the charger to the camera seem to be discharged for the canon A570IS. Since using Alkalines is a waste of money with digital cameras I don't know what else to do. I guess my best option is return this second one and forget about this canon A570IS."
4,You get what you pay for,"While this camera functions well, the body chassis is built out of plastic. The switches and toggles seem sturdy enough to last a couple of years, but may come loose after prolonged use. The LCD screen's images look grainy.The AA batteries are both a plus and minus. While the batteries are available everywhere, I would prefer regular NiCd rechargable ones. It would be easier for me to just bring a charger, rather than go outside to find a shop that carries batteries.All in all, it is a good product, but I would rather pay more next time and get a sturdier camera."
5,PowerShot A570IS,Works great and I love the dial on the top to change to preset settings. Used it underwater with a soft plastic case and pictures came out great. I could not see the LCD screen underwater through the clear plastic. It was too bright outside even underwater. I just turned off the LCD display and used the viewfinder. I was impressed that the viewfinder zooms with the optical zoom function. Battery usage is normal for a camera with these features. Overall a great camera for the price.
4,Good but not flawless,"Taking all factors into account, I decided to purchase this camera. I like it except for the flash recycle time. This drives me crazy. It feels like forever before I can snap another picture. It bothers me enough I'm not sure I would make the same purchase again. I really wanted the optical viewfinder, so that greatly narrowed my choices, but I found I haven't used it like I thought I would. The LCD screen is adequate. Just wanted to put my two cents in if you were pondering the same questions!"
1,battery issue,"Don't buy this camera. I tried 2 recently and both had ""low battery indicator"" problem. Low battery indicator comes after taking only 4-5 shots on freshly charged batteries."
4,Great little camera...,"This handy little camera gives you a beautiful clear photo. A bit of a challenge for a biginner, like me, but I'm learning and am well pleased.Canon PowerShot A570IS 7.1MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom"
5,veiwfinder,This camera is great. Easy to use and having the veiwfinder is a real plus. Having the motion stablizer is a plus for me and works well. Good pictures and good movies. I highly recommend it. M. Davis
4,Good camera for the price!!,"I was looking for an inexpensive compact digital camera to complement my Nikon D80 which is my main camera. This Canon fits the bill. Its not as small as the other Sony's, Casio's, Fuji's, Kodak's or Panasonic's I have owned over the last few years, owing to the AA battery, however its reasonable.Pros:Low cost/ Nice pic/ resolution/ Convenient selector for various modes: esp Aperture/ Shutter/ Programmable modes/ AA battery/ view finder/ 4.0X optical zoom/ Flash level control/ Adjustable ISO'sCons:slightly big/ construction can be betterOverall good camera for the price. I bought it on Amazon and got a free 2 GB SD. Overall i paid less then $200 for Sony rechargable battery/ charger/ Canon camera bag with the camera and the card..so got a good deal!"
1,Lens problem after only 9 months,"Lens won't retract and the error message ""Lens error, restart camera"" displays on the rear screen every time I power on/off the camera. After doing a web search, turns out many other Canon point/shoot digital camera owners have been experiencing the same ""lens error"" issue. I will take my camera to the repair shop since it is still under warranty. But I won't be buying a Canon again."
1,Poor Construction,After using this camera for 1.5 yrs it quit altogether. Never have I had a camera that did not hold up under normal conditions. (I still have most of my old ones and they still function) Very disappointed.
2,Auto Mode Settings Make For Poor Picture Quality,I don't want to duplicate what others have said. There are good things about this camera and not so good things. The one thing though that irks me me is the noise performance and in particular that the ISO setting in automatic mode produces very poor quality indoor pictures. For a entry level consumer camera that will be used in auto mode or video mode for 99% of the time this is unacceptable in my opinion.
3,Dissapointed,"You know, I am really questioning the authenticity of some of the reviews i have read on here. The camera is a VERY average camera. The pictures are grainy and noisy. Nothing like my old Sony cybershot which was super clear.After reading the reviews, I was excited to buy the camera for such a low price. After getting this camera and taking the same exact picture with my old sony and the new canon(same image, lighting), the two pictures came out vastly different. The canon picture was noisy and grainy looking while the cybershot came out really clear. I am not even a photography-type person. I am just an average user and even these pictures' quality were not good enough for me. So all I have to say is, I am never buying a canon again.The only reason I am giving it a 3 and not a 2 is cause this camera does have a lot of features and really, that is the ONLY plus."
4,Excellent camera for the price,"Excellent camera - very satisfied. I replaced an older Canon model (Power Shot A10) and left on month-long tour one week after I got the camera. Results were better than expected, for a strict 'point and shoot; don't bother me with the tech stuff' camera person. Good shots even of eagles in flight, snatching fish from river. My only concern is not great ability to predict battery life, although it does give adequate warning of Low Battery condition. I'd definitely buy it all over again."
4,Very Pleased,I was surprised by the small size of the camera but very pleased with the performance of the camera. So far it has done everything I've asked it to do. I'm not a professional but I do take lots of shots for newsletters.
3,Nice but not great,"Nice camera, relatively good pix...image stabilization not great...AA battery pac MOST annoying and archaic.... ended up re-selling this and went back to my Sony DCS 5"
5,The best camera you can get for the price,"I've had it for a few months now and it works just great. The picture quality is excellent, easy to use, a lot more functions than regular digital cameras (non pro) and you can have the lens changed if you need a more powerful one.Definitely the best camera you can get for the price."
2,"Great pics, slow pictures, battery hog","My previous camera was a digital Canon PowerShot A70. Had it for 5 years and it was great. One day it just quit working. With the cost to repair vs. the cost to buy new, we figured we'd just get the newest iteration of the A70, which seemed to be the Powershot A570IS. At just over $100, seemed like a great choice for us! Well, it has more mega pixels, and an extra zoom feature the A70 did not. It also takes 2 AA batteries instead of 4, and that's all great. However, the lag time between the time you press down the shutter and the time the picture actually ""takes"" is way too long, especially with human subjects. Also, the thing hogs batteries, AND does not give you much warning before it dies. There have been several disappointing situations where we've had no pictures of various occasions because of this annoying problem.This NEVER happened with our A70, so I know Canon can do better!!!"
1,Lens error,"I bought it from Amazon, hardly used it but I reckon it had a mechanical shutter flaw. Sent it to Canon support service.. Not a good buy. I would not recommend anyone for this item.. Not worthy.."
2,Bad Battery Life,"Love the size, features, and pictures this camera takes but the battery life is terrible. I got one and returned it because after 5-10 pictures the low battery warning came on then it shut down after 10 more. The replacement did the exact same thing. Don't plan on taking this camera on a hiking trip keep it close to you battery charger. I also tried several different types of batteries NiMH... I wish it used 4 AA's like my A75 it was a great camera until it broke after only 3 years of use."
2,Flash takes too long for night pics,"I've owned an older version of the Canon Powershot (4yrs) and needed to upgrade. However, I was disappointed in the A570IS's capability of taking pics that require flash (night, indoors, etc). The flash took about 3-4 secs to recharge before it was ready to take another shot and this greatly reduced my ability to take spontaneous pictures (esp of kids!).To be fair, all pics that did not require flash came out great. However, most of the pictures that we usually take are of kids/family which are usually indoors i.e. requiring flash.We ended up returning the A570IS and instead bought the Canon 1000 Elph - which I've been very happy with for the past 2mths."
5,Love this PowerShot A570 IS,"I brought this camera to replace my other PowerShot. I love Cannon products, so I got this PowerShot A570 IS. I love the 7.1 mega pixels, becuse the other camera I had was only a 3.1 mega pixels.I use this camera alot for my business, as I take pictures of Interior Design work, for my clients.This camera is light weight, and small enough to put in my purse. Takes great sharp pictures.I recommend this Canon PowerShot A570 IS."
2,"Battery died so fast, very disappointed","I decided to buy another canon, because my previous A95 is really good.A brand new battery died within 2 hours, camera refused to take any picture, I only took 10 pictures and 15 minutes movies.So I tried my 2500mA rechargable betteries, it report change bettery again, but the same rechargable battery works very well and last long on one my old camera.More over, I ordered a new one, but received it in a broken box, like a used one or returned one.I am going to return it."
2,"Received yesterday, returned today","Length:: 0:18 MinsThere's a constant diagonal streak on the upper middle part of the videos i took with this camera. This unit could be a lemon, but I'm just bothered that they didn't checked this unit. See the attached unaltered video (sorry about the file size).P.s. I have another Canon camera - S2IS which is still the best IMHO. I purchased this A570IS for my sister who likes things compact and simple to use. Having returned this, I will be looking for a reliable model."
5,cannon powershot,Cannon has always put out excellent camera's. The pictures are crisp and the camera is so usable friendly. Thank you..
5,Too good for words,"Wow. This is the best camera I have ever purchased. The image stabilization makes a HUGE difference. I have a small child and no matter how much she is moving when I take the picture, it is very clear. The LCD is large and clear. Also, the video feature takes just as good video as our expensive Sony video camera! I can't say enough good things about this camera."
4,Nice camera. Lots of features.,We bougt this camera to replace another Canon that we lost. It is easy to use and takes nice pictures. The 2.5in LCD on the rear is easy to read and using the camera is straightforward. The previous Canaon used to run on 4 AA but this one runs on 2 AA batteries so it weighs a little less. Unfortunately battery life is not too good - maybe due to the larger LCD? I have started to turn off the LCD as much as possible to see if that helps.
5,The Perfect Little Camera,I love this camera. I had a Nikon L6 a few months earlier and it was not have the camera. The lag time drove me nuts. After 2 months it had a defect (Lens Error) and I returned it (Amazon was very graceful and courteous and offered!) I purchased the Canon A570IS (andother great product and great price thru amazon.com) and LOVE it. It's been a huge difference. I take it everywhere. It's so quick and easy to use. Very little lag time. I'm just a mom that doesn't want to miss a second of my children's lives and this is the camera for me. I don't have hours to read the instruction manual. My photos turn out great though. I couldn't be happier! I would highly recommend this camera! It's great!
5,Easy to use,"I am somewhat familiar with Canon cameras as this is my 3rd Canon digital camera, I've updated because I've needed more megapixels. These cameras seem to be getting more and more user friendly.I don't know the technical specs on this camera. I know I was looking for a small camera to travel with. I was also looking for a camera with the ""handle"" on the side to hold the camera steady. This camera slips nicely in my purse, takes a great photo and is very easy to use. The photos have come out sharp and clear.I've never used the video feature in my older cameras but found this camera video friendly."
4,AS570IS,"I bought this camera for my wife. She does not like high tech anything! the size and convenience factor made her a believer. It produces excellent photos due in part because of the image stabilization feature. The quality of construction, the size, and the long battery life makes this one of the best I've seen. My camera is a Nikon D70, big, much more complicated and versital, but I know I'll be borrowing my wifes Canon a lot!"
4,The Point and shoot camera for the Digital Rebel XT user,"This camera is a pocket-sized SLR ! I mean it has all the capabilities of advanced Prosumer SLRs like the Rebel XT in a compact size. The Image Stabilization (IS) and Face Detection works well and is a very helpful capability. The full creative control is a major plus and is very similar to the Digital Rebel XT controls.The Pros : good start up time, quick focus lock even in low light, face detection, IS, creative controls, AA batteriesThe cons : Slow zoom, very average battery performance - about 50 flash shots drained 2 alkaline AA batteries."
5,Wife loves it! (and that's the point),"Cute, but too small for my big ol' paws. Wife happy, me happy.Photos good. Operation simple. Should have included DC adaptor/battery charger - I'm getting danged tired of buying AA batteries.Menu system is pretty well thought out - I didn't have to look at the manual to set up the camera."
4,Wished I could give it 5 stars,"I purchased this Canon camera to replace another returned camera. The 570IS is so full of features, I may never use all of them. Although I did find a couple favorite settings. The AUTO setting works well, even in low light. The continuous shutter is really cool. Can't wait to use it for sports shots! The benefit of having a viewfinder is priceless.The downsides of the camera are not enough to return it. 1) It does eat batteries. I will now invest in rechargeable batteries. 2) The battery/disk compartment can be cumbersome. I felt like I was going to break the door off trying to open the compartment. 3) So far, I can only get the date stamp on a certain view. Not available on every format. The manual wasn't helpful in explaining the limitation. 4) It is bigger and bulkier than some of the other cameras. However, using AA batteries and having a viewfinder does add to its size.But so far, I am very pleased."
5,Canon Camera,"I'm really glad I bought this camera. Did quite a bit of research prior to purchase and for the price, this, so far, has been a good purchase. I am a ""point & shoot"" type of person - not a ""photographer"" so it works great for me. Easy to use and small enough to put in my purse or pocket."
4,Great...if it weren't for the batteries...,"I bought this camera at Thanksgiving and am on the 4th set of batteries. I can hardly take more than 10 shots before the camera tells me the batteries are running low. Interestingly, if I open and re-shut the battery door, often times, but not always, this makes the battery warning sign turn off. Maybe a bad connection? But what do you do? Can't take the chance that the batteries really are low and then miss the shot you're after.... I'm going to contact Canon and see what's up."
3,battery issue but seems nice otherwise,"One-third of the time (just 53 pix in 2 days), it displayed 'low battery' icon or 'change battery' message (new 2500mAh NiMh rechargeable batteries properly installed, i.e. in correct direction, door shut tight). The 'change battery' appears as soon as turning on the camera and doesn't allow shooting, so I missed great shots of trumpeter swans overhead due to this, as I had to turn it back off and tap the camera and shake it around a bit. This should not have to be done as often as I did it in just 2 days! Otherwise it's a nice size and seems to have a plethora of features. I've requested a replacement one today, so crossing my fingers!"
5,Fabulous Canon A570IS,"This camera is phenomenal. More than adequate resolution, image stabilization that works, automatic face detection that really works (God knows how!), compact and handelable, super lens -- all in all, a fantastic digital camera. Several friends also have and love this one. My only wish would be for a still more powerful zoom lens, but this is quite adequate. You won't be disappointed in this one."
3,Malfunctioned upon Arrival,"I literally had this thing out of the box for about 3-4 hours and I had my first problem. I tested the settings for about an hour. I went to turn it back on again and it wouldn't turn on. I kept pushing the on/off button repeatedly but the camera wouldn't turn on. I changed the batteries. Still nothing. I called Canon Customer Support who said it was possible the lens malfunctioned while closing which was keeping it from turning back on again. I'm hoping it was a fluke. So far the pictures I got seemed okay but since I hadn't even taken the shrink wrap off the LCD yet, I couldn't tell for sure. Complicated settings. Make sure to read the manual first. I'm really disappointed but I'll probably stick to Canon. Hopefully it was just a fluke and won't happen on the vacation I purchased it for."
4,Price is right,"I have taken quite a few pictures with this camera so far and for the price it seems like a decent buy. It comes with an almost unusable memory card, 16 mb, which is too small to take very many pictures at the full resolution, so expect to purchase a larger one. The image stabilization is good but the video is not as sharp as I would like. The memory card is located in the battery compartment, which is not a good place for it to be but it hasn't been much of a problem for me. The macro mode works really well and it takes very sharp closeups. The smallest aperture setting is F8 but it has a wide range for ISO settings up to 1600. For a cheaper point and shoot I think it's a good buy."
4,Best Buy,The camera is very nice. Especially the video it takes has got a very good quality. Nice compact. Not used much although but I liked the product very much. For under 150 bucks its a best buy.
4,Nice camera,"Canon PowerShot A570IS 7.1MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized ZoomNice camera, I purchased this for my non-tech Mother. Even with all the extra functions she can still take great pictures. Especially like the slider to move from camera mode to viewing images. Much simpler for her. Only beef is with the battery-memory card cover. It is difficult to close requiring a lot of fiddling. Otherwise, good product."
5,Canon PowershotA570is,"I bought this camera to replace a 35mm SLR. So far it is GREAT. I needed to get pictures into my computer without getting them developed and using a scanner. (My new Dell Laptop has no serial port.) It takes NO time to scan them in, and then I can put them anyplace I want. I would recommend this camera to anyone who isn't ""camera-savvy"" since I have only used it in auto focus mode & it works great. I will eventually play with manual settings, but so far I haven't needed to do that. Hope this helps."
3,power hunger little camera,"I have an A520. This is a newer product and I was expecting it to be better. It is better but not by much. The only part that got worse is the battery consumption and the low battery warning. I used a pair of fully charged NiMH and the battery warning was flashing after 10 non-flash shots. Actually, the battery lasted for more than another 20-30 shots. Yet, the low battery warning is annoying.My A520 arrived with white speckles between the display and the protective cover. This one came clean.It constantly overexposes and that could be easily worked around by setting the exposure compensation and the flash power to about two steps down (-2/3). The time between shots is long especially when flash is used.With higher ISO and Image Stabilizer, I would expect it to do much better then A520 under low light but the differences are minor.The display is much larger, clear and the color is good. The face recognition works reasonably well."
2,performance disappointing,"I bought this camera for my father. I was curious about the quality and compared the images from this camera to my Fujifilm S3000 (2001 technology, 3.2 Megapixels) and the results were disappointing. I thought it being Canon and having newer technology the camera's images would be better than the S3000. Comparing photos side-by-side, the Canon didn't even match the sharpness of the S3000. Given the many positive comments on Amazon, I wonder if maybe this one is defective. I read reviews of other Canon digital cameras and they all noted quality issues. Read reviews about the Canon G9."
5,Excellent camera!,"People complaining about battery life just need to purchase good batteries and a charger. I bought Maha Powerex batteries and they last very long between charges even though I also use the camera for videos. Great camera, great price."
3,"Great Camera, low battery life","I have had this camera for 2 years, and I have used it 3 times in the last year, because the batteries are always dead. I charge them, and the are dead in 5 minutes. It takes great pictures, if I could get a rechargeable lithium-ion in a ""AA"" size, I would never part with it. Now I can't find a good lithium camera, they look like they suck for the under $300 range."
2,disappointing,"My wife and I each bought one of these for backup/pocket cameras after being very happy with an older A series Canon. Out of the box, this is lot of camera for the money, impressive feature set and image processing. The image stabilization is hardly noticeable so it's hard to count it as a feature. However, both cameras need to be replaced due to mechanical and electronic issues after moderate use: camera one, the lens outer shutters get stuck part way open; camera two, always shows ""battery low"" and has dust spots on the image sensor. They will cost more to repair than they are worth, and frankly, why put money into such an unreliable camera?We've had Canon's for a long long time but this one has us thinking about other brands."
4,decent camera.,i did research on this camera before i bought it and it hasn't let me down. it has a lot of freedom in adjusting to what you like. if you don't know or like manually messing with your camera you should get something slightly more simple. but i love it.
4,Low battery warning fix --buy the newer stronger rechargeables,"Great news.After seven months of use I suggest you have to buy the newer stonger rechargeable AA batteries like the Duracell ($13). This fixes the low battery problem and it is a non issue.Great camera -I particularly like the zoom and image stabilization to prevent blurring!!! Also try program mode and different ISO settings.Best Regards,Roger /Nashville"
5,Great for an amateur photog,"I needed a digital camera that was really automatic and this is it! My previous 2 cameras needed too many manual adjustments to get a decent picture, but this one is great. It also takes great videos, which I hadn't really required but which I have already used. I highly recommend."
5,No Complaints,I have zero complaints about this camera. I toke it with me on a trip to Utah and i have beautiful mountain pictures. They are just breath taking. Every picture i've taken has turned out clear. I am very pleased with my purchase of this camera.
1,worst camera (battery problems),"I purchased this camera to replace an older model Canon that had died after 3 years. this camera uses regular AA batteries (as did the one it replaced); however, this model will drain a set of fresh batteries in about 10 shots!I highly recommend purchasing another camera!***************** Update 2013 ****************************************I still have this camera and occasionally use it.The battery problem was due to a defective contact in the battery compartment.When I finally suspected this, I used a very thin piece of wood (non-conductive) to make the contact firm against the battery. That mostly fixed the issue!"
2,Decent... barely,"At first blush, I liked the camera a lot - pretty good quality overall. But after using it for a bit, its biggest drawback was apparent - the battery life is terrible. It uses standard AAA batteries, but they just drain down so quickly. In almost a year that I have owned the camera, by my rough calculation, I must have spent half of the camera price in batteries. And I really don't take that many pictures, we only used it on family occassions and other trips once in a while. I would not recommend this camera."
4,non amateur camera,"Great buy! Canon is a brand to rely on!Quick load and pictures transfers to card fast!You can do pro quality pics using this cam!Great cam, great price, great pics!"
2,Good but SLOW,"I bought this camera because it is one of the few less expensive decent quality ""one handed"" cameras left on the market. It takes great pictures, but it takes 6-13 (I timed it) seconds for the flash to recharge. The view screen is also not true to color. The pictures generally come out good, but you just have to trust in the camera and not believe what you see on the screen."
4,Good Camera,We've had a lot of Canon gear and this model is nice. The only thing I don't like is that it is substantially smaller than our A40 series and will take some getting used to. Feature wise there is no comparison and the battery life of these newer models is exceptional. Large LCD is nice too. Handle this model first though because it is pretty small and somewhat smooth/slippery.
3,Shoots good pictues but has processing delays.,This camera produces nice pictures but has very long delays after each snap. This delay is specially prominent in night due to flash charging. The processing time after shooting is also high.
3,Good features for the price! But ...,"The camera is really well build with nice cool features of image stabilization, manual control, face detection.Ended up returning, since I wanted a decent video, but the video was choppy, the audio and video was not synching. The low light pictures were always a disappointment, tried all the settings (I know the basics of photography) still no appealing results. It could be that my camera alone defective but did not want to take chance, would put $50 to get a better one, Amazon has other nice ones too."
2,very short battery life span,I have the 6.0 pixels of the same model... don't like it... because battery life is too short. it uses AA rechargable--- pain in the neck at times... there are better options out there
1,Outdated model ! do not buy !,"I'm not against this cameraIt's just that this model became outdated, and a newer model (A590 IS) is better and even CHEAPER than thisCanon PowerShot A590IS 8MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom"
2,....*Sigh*....,This product was pretty good until after a week the error popped up saying lens error please restart. Now it wont take pictures at all even when I restart it. I do not recommend the camera.
2,Quit working in 3 months time,"The picture quality itself is decent. However, my camera will now only take one picture before indicating that the batteries are low and shutting off. I've only had it since July. I haven't even used it that much. The battery life has always been poor. I replaced them several times on vacation. I was only using the viewfinder to save power. I thought Canon was a good brand, but I won't buy another one."
1,Canon has VERY POOR Customer service,"If you buy any camera from Canon, good luck if it goes bad! Canon USA is a nightmare to deal with and get a repair done. You'll hit brick wall after brick wall. I had been a longtime Canon camera user (over 20 years) and will never buy another one. I'm now only buying Nikon cameras exclusively now. Do yourself a favor, and DO NOT buy a Canon!"
1,Beware - cheap for a reason - battery connection problems!,"Warning - Don't Buy This Camera!I bought one of these for our family and one for my father-in-law. Both had one major problem - The battery case will not close tightly, causing low battery indicator after a few minutes of use. You have to open the case and reload the batteries to make the connection again. When we bought this about 6 months ago, it was priced around $200 - now it's $139. I think Canon knows they have a problem with this camera.I will admit that when the battery power problems doesn't appear, the camera works fine, but that's like saying when the TV stays on, the picture is fine...so please, stay away from this camera at all costs!"
2,Problems w/Canon A570,"I purchased the camera in March of this year and have rarely used it. The zoom quit working which is so disappointing. My previous Sony camera worked like a charm for four years until I lost it skiing in Colorado. Also, the Canon LED screen is impossible to see in daylight making pictures a little difficult. I would not buy this ever again."
1,A common Issue!,"Don't buy this camera. It's good at first. However after having it for some years, I discovered other owners are having this same problem -- The camera shuts itself off even if it has brand new AA batteries installed. It says low battery. So I can't take any pictures. There's a problem with either the software or the battery contacts becoming bent, which I can't fix. Screw you cannon, I am out $150."
4,"Can satisfy a tough customer, my daughter","I selected this camera based on a number of criteria that helped narrow down the selection for ""purseable"", low cost, ""point-and-shoot"" and ""but I want to do this or that, too"" cameras. In other words, it's a good camera and takes good pictures AND video clips.I read all the reviews for this product and I knew ahead of time the limitations; i.e. if you want to capture your kid's picture frolicking in the bath tub, the results are hit and miss. So, take more than one picture, and as someone else said, if you don't want to miss a scene, take a video.The only disappointment was the battery short life. The different evaluations give you how many pictures you can take with a set of fully charged batteries but they don't say anything about what happens when you spend 2-3 minutes reviewing every picture you took on the large LCD screen. The advantage of the A570IS is that you can pop in 2 AA batteries and off you go.In conclusion, customer is happy."
4,A GIFT,This was given to a 13 year old girl who has littleexperience with digital anything. Within 2 hours shewas comfortable with the instructions and practice tohead out to the local teen hangout. Well worth the price.
5,LOVE IT!,"I've had Canon cameras since I bought my first Powershot A10 years ago. The A570IS is my 4th one. (I upgrade every couple of years). I purchased it last spring and have had no trouble with it.A friend was so impressed with the quality and ease of use, that she bought one in August - she has nothing but praise for it too.I recently bought another A570IS as a Christmas gift for my son.The only thing I would change is the batteries. I wish the A570IS used 4 of the AA size like my previous Canons. I know Canon wanted a smaller size and less bulk, but with 4 rechargeable AA's I could go forever before I had to recharge."
5,Canon PowerShot A57015 7.1MP,"This camara exceeds my expectations. I thought it would be a little larger, but I actually like the smaller size better! I enjoy the larger view window than on my previous camera, and of course best of all, the pictures are clear and sharp. Since I have slight hand tremors at my relatively advanced age, the feature that stabilizes the image while I snap the picture does away with the fuzzies.I congratulate myself on making a wise choice (with a little help from my friends)."
1,way too slow ...,"The picture processing is way too slow, therefore the 'pause' between shots is like a few seconds, which is absolutely unacceptable. I also had SD700 and SD800, and they are way more responsive."
1,Terrible niose,"Upon received this camera with a lot of good expectations, everything looks smooth until the picture is shown on the LCD. Ohn my dear, the it's so noisy. Even at ISO 100 the background start to show mosaic like niose. ISO @1600 the picture background looks like my carpet floor! Never see this kind of noisy picture before. Returned right away. Defect no doubt but how did they let it out of the factory?"
1,Don't buy this camera...,"I hate this camera. The first day I used it the batteries died. These were Duracell AA Alkaline batteries, which is what Canon's Customer Support told me to use when I complained about it. Since then the batteries constantly die! Shutterspeed is ridiculously slow and it even freezes and goes black sometimes. The only fix is turning off the camera and restarting it. HORRIBLE! When I complained about all this 2 weeks after buying the thing, Canon said to use rechargeable batteries or Duracell AA Alkaline batteries, which is what I was using. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CAMERA!!"
2,I dont receive it !!,I order it and i paid for it and after long time they find out that the camera lost
3,Red eyes?,"Maybe it is too soon to be sure about it, but I think the red eyes reductor doesn't work well. I used to have another Canon, the A70, and the same system in the old camera was way better. One other point: it takes too long to save the image in the memory card. But, as I said, maybe I don't know yet how to operate the camera."
1,Cheap Plastic Camera,"I purchased two, one for me and one for my husband. I could not get the battery apartment open on either camera. I returned both of them. Camera is very light and cheap feeling."
1,Canon Powershot A570IS,The camera was defective. The low battery indicator stayed on even with new batteries. Amazon was great on the return and replacement. I went with a SX100IS instead.
4,Great little camera,"I bought this camera when I was on vacation and my camera suddenly stopped working. I wasn't expecting it to take such good pictures. It is very easy to use, with easy to understand instructions for using the various features."
1,"Shoddily built, recurring problems - not buying a Canon again","I too did a lot of research prior to buying, but this camera never lived up to its promise. Sensor went bad within 6 months of purchase. Replaced -- same thing happened about 6 months later, again. From the start, the camera seemed to use batteries up too quickly, or to give readings on battery life that weren't trustworthy. That's only gotten worse -- it sometimes shows new batteries as being in need of changing. Now it simply won't power up with any battery in it. We bought this about four years ago to upgrade an older Sanyo camera, which we ended up continuing to use as it was more reliable. Just bought a Nikon to replace this one. Don't think I'll be buying a Canon again after this experience..."
1,"eats batteries, poor service","After many hours of research, I decided to buy the A570IS; unfortunately, I ordered it on-line, when I should have bought it at the local Wal-Mart, where they take anything back. I sent the first camera back to the Canon factory, because it ate batteries. Even tho I used the NIMH and had a battery charger, the camera still ate batteries. Second camera comes from Canon (re-furbished) and the same thing happens; it eats batteries and doesn't transfer pictures. So I've spent lots of time sending cameras back and trying to get them to work. I give up. I want my money back, and I'm still haggling with Canon."
1,Camera is malfunctioning,"I bought this camera based on the high rating it had. I was initially pleased with it and the way it took pictures, but after having it only 2 and a half months, it suddenly out of the blue stopped working. It had not been damaged, I always took very good care of it, fresh batteries did nothing to get it to work. Very frustrating since I need it for my business online. I guess I will have to send it in and see if they can figure out the problem...I certainly hope so, otherwise Canon will lose a customer for good!"
2,"Too light, Going with Elph","This product, while I'm sure has great quality photos (it's a Cannon and everyone I spoke too unanimously said OOO, a cannon is a good brand), was too light and flimsy. I will look for something a little more sturdy and seemingly well made. I'm thinking about getting an elph with wide angle.."
1,no battery life,i bought this camera explicilty to make small youtube videos only to find that a brand new pair of batteries lasts about 5 minutes in video mode. wish i could send it back. otherwise i am sure it is a fine camera.
5,Canon Digital Camera,"Already had a camera like this one, and liked it so well that I purchased another for my son. Makes beautiful videos as well as still pictures. Very easy to use. Highly recommend."
4,Good camera for the price,This is a basic digital camera that satisfies the needs of novice or a common household user. It is certainly not for professionals but is a good product for the price.
5,Canon A570IS,"Great camera. I'm happy with it. Works like an external drive with Linux if using the latest gphoto2. In Debian Lenny with KDE, the usual file window pops up for the camera contents. Fast shipping. For reviews on this camera just search the net for sites like image-resource.com, digitalcamerareview.com and steves-digicams.com. They do much better than I could."
5,Christmas surprise,The camera was a Christmas surprise for my wife. She has used it a lot in the short time she has had it. The photos are clear and crisp. It is simple to use with a lot of options available as she learns to use it.
3,"""Simple"" operation","The camera does a good job and I am satisified. But it's more clumsy to get it to do what you want than I expected from a ""point & shoot"" camera. Also quite difficult to never see the shot IN FOCUS before shooting. Probably a way to do it, but I haven't found the solution yet. I have a more complicated Nikon SLR and I expect it to be complicated. But the point & shoot was bought for my wife and she's intimidated by all the ""options."""
5,Love my Canon,"WOW! I love this camera, wish that I would have bought a Canon the first time around. I haven't been disappointed with a picture yet. Nice clear photos. No blur like my old camera. I highly recommend this camera. GO CANON!!!"
4,Great canon point and shoot,"Point and shoot camera but when you add the chdk firmware, it becomes a more powerful camera. Able to shoot delayed shutter release photos, even extra fast shutter release like macro water drop photo. (I am obviously an amateur in photography, did not want an expensive SLR that needs very extra care).Bought many more accessories for thisCanon PowerShot A590 A570 IS Digital Camera HD Professional Accessory Kit,Opteka 10x HD Professional Macro Lens for Canon PowerShot A570 A590 IS Digital Cameraincluding the different lenses and adapter, underwater housing case for underwater shots in scuba diving. Less quality compared to SLRs, but if you can take great pictures with your phone and tablet, you can also take great pictures with this camera.Since it uses aa batteries, its easy to just buy when power is low, but flash recovery is way slow (about 3 seconds or more) compared to the other regular digital point and shoot. This is the only CON I can think of."
2,Battery always low,"I'm disappointed by this camera. Even if the panoramic option is very good, 2 years after buying it, it was impossible to take pictures, any battery, even new and powerfull, was automatically detected as a ""low battery"".Great qualities, but a very big default..."
4,"Great Camera, Awful Software.","This is a great camera packed with features. The zoom and IS work great, and produce clear pics. You can put it in auto mode, and take great pictures while you learn all of the other features.The software is kind of buggy, I've installed it twice and it still does not recognize the camera and work quite right, no big deal, you can just go under ""my computer"" and select the camera and pull them that way.I'm interested in being more creative and learning about all of the different things I can do, but If you just want a simple point and click that takes great pictures without all of the bells and whistles, a Kodak Easyshare may be your option, and the Kodak software is great."
5,I love my new camera!,"After comparing several cameras in this price range, I decided on this one. I'm so glad I did. I have gotten great quality pictures, the camera is easy to use, and the software, which is Vista compatible, was very easy to install and navigate. I'm very happy with my purchase!"
5,"Great stories, great artwork!","This is the perfect book to introduce readers of all ages to the creation myths of different religons and cultures. In these days when the teaching of evolution and modern cosmology are controversial, this book provides valuable perspective on the way different people have accounted for the earth and its inhabitants. It should be required reading for all public school administrators, and would be a valuable addition to any school (or home) library."
2,Little new information here,"I found little new information in this book past what I already new about the women's tour from watching on TV and following in the papers. The book is probably of little interest to non-tennis fans. However, the writing style is fine and if you know little about these women and want to learn more this is the book to read."
4,Excellent look into women's tennis,"The women's tennis tour is more popular than the men's these days and the women in this book are the reason why. This is an up close look at the Williams sisters, Jennifer Capriati, Lindsay Davenport, Martina Hingis and many others. The author tells you much that you already know and a few things you don't. His style is very good and the book was a really easy read."
3,Trashing the Tour,"This book is kind of trashy, at times I am a little embarassed to be reading it, but it is enjoyable anyway. I follow professional tennis closely, so it is interesting to me."
1,Do not be fooled,"Save yourself some money - if you want to read catty remarks about celebrities- buy a tabloid at the local grocery checkout counter. While the tennis tour is made up of various young, fallible and sometimes not particularly sympathetic characters, they pale in comparison to a tabloid journalist trying to exploit those who make the mistake of talking to him. This pulp product is not literature - it is light fare at best. If the book had a worldwide ranking , like the tennis players it purports to describe, the book would be ranked with the lowest level of gossip columnists. Don't be fooled that he is an ""insider"" who really knows the players, he is an outsider who is referred to on the tour as a ""hanger on""."
4,Would love a sequel,"J. Wertheim writes a great online tennis column for SI. I read it everyday and I'm appreciative of his knowledge and love of the sport. Behind the scenes are many players struggling, not just the stars. It was also sad to hear how many vulnerable young girls are exploited by their coaches. Parents should keep a watchful eye on their girls and not expect them to support the family. That is of course the downside of the tour. The good side is that it give many with talent a chance to do what they love and make a living. Currently the tour pays much more and lower ranked players have more of a chance to make a living. Serena and Venus no longer dominate, but they can win big matches while only playing part time. The overall level of the game has risen and the competition is even fiercer. Please write a sequel."
2,Keeps Crashing,I bought this for my 5yo daughter who will be attending Kindergarten in the Fall as a supplement to the old fashioned 1 on 1 that we've been having.Unfortunately the program crashes whenever we switch activities. I would have been very angry had in not been so inexpensive. I'm going to try making a disk image so that my computer doesn't have to constantly access the disc.
1,No refunds from Learning Company,This product did not work. I returned it to The Learning Company months ago and haven't received a refund or any response. Buyer beware.
5,Courageous achievement,"These guys have achieved something I think many of us dream about but rarely act upon. They gave up their run of the mill corporate jobs, risked serious debt, but with courage took a massive risk and it's paid off. I really admire their bravery. Their take on life whilst travelling across the USA is refreshingly eye opening. The people they meet along the way give a view of life that is rarely heard of - or at least over here in the UK! Very inspiring film that makes the viewer take a look at their own lives too."
5,The Anti-Borat Movie,"Fresh... inspiring... hopeful... funny. This is a great documentary... the antithesis of Borat in that is shows you what MOST of America is REALLY all about - pursuing your dream, making connections, being happy. I highly recommend this!!!"
1,10mph is how this slow uninspiring movie feels like,"I like documentaries, but this one is a waste of time. The creators try very hard to make this a triumphant soul searching film but in the end Im not sure of the lessons anyone learns. Sure they meet interesting people along the way but definitely not enough to keep the movie going. They have money problems in the middle of their trip and are unsure they can go on, but I didnt feel sorry for them. I mean they weren't riding across America to raise money for cancer or to raise awareness about a social problem. They were riding for their own benefit; whether that be spiritual or making $$$ from the movie. In the end the movie is a road trip across America, with stops at McDonalds, uninspiring jabber between friends, and meeting local people in small towns. Sure, fun when you do it, but boring to watch a movie about it."
1,Boring,"This is a self-infatuated movie about three 22-year-olds who quit their jobs in a vaguely-defined ""corporate America"" to cross the country. Most of the film is of them talking amongst themselves about how they're running out of money, and about the ""deep"" experiences they are having on the trip. Along the way they visit plenty of interesting people, but since we don't see more than a minute or two of each, it's hard to get much out of the visits. Additional footage features excitement such as a couple of Segway crashes (some staged), dogs chasing the Segway, and carrying the Segway over a barbed wire fence. I have no doubt that the trip was eye-opening for the participants (who seem to have had no relevant life experiences or travel up to this point: never seen a cow before, I'd reckon), but it doesn't make a very interesting movie."
1,"kindle users, save your money","It should come as no surprise that this book is completely useless on a kindle. Of course it doesn't include the accompanying audio CD and the percussion staff is optimized for the larger format kindle so the staff is unreadable on the smaller format.My mistake was receiving the kindle, finding drum rudiments and being too excited about making my first purchase.Bottom line; this book is completely useless on a kindle."
4,A bit much for beginners....,"This book is fine, but it does jump right in with both feet. My son and I are learning together so I bought this book along with a couple others. If your looking for a good ""beginners"" book, this is probably not it. Don't get me wrong, its a good book, but maybe geared more towards the intermediate player looking to take his drumming (rudiments) to the next level. I will pick a way at some of this, but my son and I will be using another book for awhile first."
4,Amazing One Shot,This one shot proves that Bendis knows how to write and its very emotional. However you can get it in the Iron Man TPB along with several other stories for about the same price.
5,Great Soap!,I love this soap. Conti Castile is wonderfully gentle to your skin. It truly is incomparable!
4,Boudicca's Revenge,"The book has a slow start, but as you read it, you become more deeply involved in reading it. It was a ""I don't want to put it down"" read. I was disappointed when it ended. I wanted more.If you love history, and especially the era the story takes place in, you will enjoy the book.It's not a light read, nor is it a plodding dry academic read.To me, it was pure entertainment that provided the opportunity to learn more about the lives of the people in Great Britain during the Roman Conquest.Boudicca's Revenge would make an awesome movie. Someone should tell Hollywood about it."
3,Very out dated,"Since this video is 15 years old, it is very outdated. It is ok for seeing what the common sites are since those never change. A castle from 1200 years ago is likely to still be around. A lot has changed in the world in 15 years and to make my point, at the end, there are tons of travel ads and one of them is for NY city and it shows the Twin towers standing in all their glory. The copy I got, since it was so old, skipped and tracked alot but was still able to watch it all the way through. The video seems to be put out by a travel agency since there are tons of ads and references to the host airlines etc. If you can get it cheap, it may be ok but don't use this as your primary source for a visit to London for sure."
2,"Contrived plot, sordid characters, devoid of denoument","A squalid little book featuring characters almost entirely devoid of redeeming qualities; even the ""heroine"" is barely admirable. The story's other principal is a male prostitute and erstwhile trainee priest, though how the transformation in lifestyles is achieved is feebly (and implausibly) handled. Although a police officer at one point claims not to believe in coincidences, the plot hinges around several outrageous ones, for instance a shadowy European underworld ""financier"" just happens to be the cousin of the prostitute's minder. The alleged street language of northwest England is incomprehensible, and the inane device of starting each chapter with a definition of one of these terms - most of which have left the reader befuddled pages earlier - beggars belief. The tale peters out unsatisfactorily at the end, revealing an author who has run out of ideas"
1,The 256MB version doesn't work with R60 either,ROM initialization error on startup.Can't install driver for VGA controller if you try to use the setup CD.Crash on shutdown.BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) if you try to dock it.It is definitely not for you if you use a Lenovo ThinkPad.
1,worthless,"I attempted to install this in a Asus Windows 7 64bit box. I preloaded the drivers I downloaded from the ATI website. The computer refused to boot. I called ATI service and they are open 9 to 5 M-H and 9-3 Fri, not at all on weekends. This is as good as no service since this was for a home computer. I am returning it. I will not buy ATI again."
3,Nice,"It's a nice book about the great Enrico Caruso, informs you quite well with the usual mistakes and leaving out a lot - to get every book about him, yes buy it, but if you look for a really good book take the unabridged version of ""My father and my family"" by Caruso jr. or the Book of Michael Scott about Caruso."

3,Not compatible with all Tamron Nikon lenses,"FIrst, there is no disclaimer on the website for this -- so let me just say that there is a small pink slip inside the box that says it does not work with several lenses in AF mode, among these the important 28-75 2.8 lens that has become their most popular for Nikon full-frame cameras....BUT....it also didn't work with the 28-300 VC lens -- another very popular lens -- it made no difference in magnification at all with this lens.FInally, it is NOISY -- there is a small metal piece inside that literally jingles -- your camera bag would sound like there is something jingling inside every time you take a step.I returned this to Amazon right away, it is basically worthless."
4,A lot of zoom for the buck,"I use this 2x converter with a Nikon D-50, paired with the Nikkor 55-200mm lens made for that camera series, with 52mm lens diameter. Most notable pro -- This pair gives me 400mm zoom -- a single 400mm lens would cost $1000 and up. If you are trying to go from 200-400mm on a budget, i would recommend this lens. If you are doubling a 55mm lens, I'd recommend buying better glass. Important -- 1. you must shoot with a tripod, this doubler does not work with auto focus, and you can't possibly steady yourself enough to get tack sharp image. (Probably goes without saying on a long lens). 2. Practice a lot with focus before you go on vacation or where ever. The manual focus on my camera combination requires a very, very light touch to get tack sharp, especially with the depth of field that you will lose in f-stop. Best for well lighted situations."
3,Information on Tamron Autofocus 2x,"This product was purchased to use on a digital camera. Upon opening the package, item #3 on the instructions states: This teleconverter is not designed for digital use. We do not guarantee its performance when used on Digital SLR cameras."" This information is not presented in the on-line information or the Amazon web- site. Misleading!"
2,Teleconverter for Nikon lenses,"When I read the instructions for this teleconverter, it indicated that it was designed only for Tamron lenses, and so I was concerned that it wouldn't work with my Nikon lenses. However, it did. It was a tight fit, but not a problem. The teleconverter worked as I expected it to. With my 70-300 lens, I was able to get 600mm (with the crop factor on my camera, 900mm!). However, when I viewed my images on my computer there was considerable fringing on the images. I had taken shots of birds on a backyard feeder, and all around the edges of the birds and the curve of the feeder pole, which had blue sky as background, there was a dark blue edge. This is not acceptable, and for that reason I returned the product. I have no idea if this would be more useful with a more expensive lens than I have, or with Tamron lenses. For my use, it was not good. Amazon's return policy has been superior."
4,Ultra Speed required,"Beware that ""this media can only be recorded with CD-RW drives bearing an Ultra Speed logo"". When it says 16X-24X, it really means your CD-RW drive cannot be slower than 16X. The media looks well made, unfortunately I couldn't get it to work with my Lite-On LTR-40125S (12X CD-RW).Amazon.com sells a Verbatim CDRW DATALIFEPLUS 4X-12X (1-Pack) if you don't have the latest CD-RW drive."
5,Won me over,"I was a little skeptical when I first picked this up, though admittedly for no good reason (maybe I'm a sucker for photos or general ""hipness""--this book has neither). Some of the dishes I prepared because I had the ingredients already, but I had a feeling the recipes would be underseasoned or just not exciting. But no, everything was delicious, and my husband loved it as well.It's also good for trying to wean yourself/family from meat-heavy dinners. We really enjoyed the beef and broccoli stir-fry, for example, which is lightened up simply with a higher proportion of vegetables. So too with the meat loaf.I refuse to do ""diet"" cookbooks, so my other reference for lightening up my cooking is Sally Schneider's A New Way to Cook, which I also highly recommend. That book has the style, size (700+ pages), photographs, and glamour over this one, but Lighter,Quicker, Better is far more accessible in terms of ingredients and attitude, and I haven't been disappointed once."
4,Good reference tool,I bought this to use as a resource for school research papers and assignments. It has been very helpful and explains scriptures well.
3,Not for everyone,"An excellent reference for current jazz students who accept the premise that ""real"" jazz began in the 1940's with Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie and further evolved by John Coltrane. For the minority of students looking for information as to how to play like Armstrong, Beiderbecke, Goodman, Shaw, Teagarden, Young andother jazz heroes of the developmental years prior to 1940, this isn't the book for you."
4,Pretty fresh look at the same ol' stuff.,"This is a good look at a rehashing of what has been, for a long time. Some authors are better at portraying certain subjects in better context than others. These 2 gentleman seem above the average! I like it, very much.The biggest value of this book though, is the fact that the great Jeff Bent was such a huge part in the authentication process.... I personally am working on several learning methods for publication. It would be an honor to have Mr. Bernt give a look at my ciriculum also. ( I probably mispelled that, thats why I need Jerf!!)Anyway, good book. Nicely done!"
3,Henna kit,"The Henna Tattoo Kit was okay. It works, but it was not what I expected. Once you put the mixture together, it only lasts for two weeks. I was expected it to already be mixed so that I could use it whenever. I guess that's my fault for not doing my research."
3,not my thing,"I ordered this to try out henna as I've always found it interesting and this a cheap alternative to a professionally done one. The product can be a hassle (and the oil has a very pungent smell, not necessarily a bad smell, however). The application wasn't too difficult but you should prepare to have some time on your hands as it takes a while to dry. I don't know if it's because I didn't leave it on long enough but my henna tattoos came out more orange than the beautiful brown that shows up from the ones I've seen. Overall it was a ""once in a lifetime"" experience for me."
1,Didn't Last At All!!!,I thought this product would last at least 4-6 weeks and after a week and a half it was rubbing off after I showered. I left it on for 6+ hours to cure and rubbed my belly with the lemon and water as it asked me to. Made the solution at least 1 hour before... I was so pretty for the week that I had it. I am just disappointed in the time that it stayed on my skin. I was hoping to at least make it to my due date and have it there for my special day.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is using this on your belly for a Mother Blessing Ceremony.
2,skimping on powder,"love this product but it seems like there is less henna powder in bag, so mixture is off. runny and stain doesnt stay very long.used to be perfect easy kit to mix, but past 3 orders of Earth Henna has had less powder.not happy :("
3,"Henna is great, stencils, not so great.","The henna mix in this kit was terrific. It did tend to get clogged in the applicator and I would get blobs on my skin from time to time, but I chalk this up more to inexperience than product. It was the stencils I was so disappointed in. There were only a couple I found appealing. Most were boring and uninspired. I'd recommend just buying the henna alone and looking for a more interesting stencil collection. I also agree with ""Okay""s review. The kit is very expensive for what it has to offer."
5,Great product!,Love the henna tattoo kit. Very fun and easy to use. Brought back my love of creating art :)
5,The Best Kit I've used,This is bar none the best henna kit I have ever used. It works so well my wife begs me for tattoos and my sister was so impressed she bought her own.
3,very light,"I put mine on a week ago and it has already almost completely faded off. And yes, I left it on for over 6 hours."
1,sucks!!!,this kit sucks we opened it up and went all over the floor when we were mixing it in the bag and they said it was cause we read the wrong... no we didnt we did what we were asposte to do!!! and they wont be me a new one.. they suck and only lasted a week on the skin!!!
5,"The very, very best!",This particular brand and kit are the best henna I have ever used/seen. It is easy to use and stays dark and fresh looking (at least 3 weeks). Longer than some that I have had done at festivals!The is also a wonderful starter kit for anyone. My daughter has been doing the neighbor kids since age 13 and they still come to the door all summer wanting more.
5,!!!!AWESOME Henna Kit!!!!,"I recently received this kit as a gift and let me tell you- it's great! The instructions are clear & easy to follow, all you have to do is mix the stuff then wait a few hours (I let it sit for 6 hours) and then you're all set to draw! Plus, if you're not the greatest artist in the world, this kit comes with cool designs that you can trace onto yourself. Keep in mind that the LONGER you let the Henna design dry on your skin, the DARKER it will turn out, and that removing it too early will result in a light orangeish color. This is the perfect first-time Henna kit."
2,Okay,"It was a lot smaller than I thought and the directions are on the back of the packaging. It is not a bad starter kit, but it is WAY over priced."
4,Henna review,"Simple instructions to follow. Worked as expected, though faded from my hand in less than a week. I imagine if I used the henna on a part of the body I'm not frequently washing, it would last longer."
4,Good for beginners.,This product is perfect for someone who is just beginning with Henna. It comes with enough to do about 10 elaborate designs and is very easy to use. It has everything you need packed in to it. The only think I found was that the henna came off much quicker than it was supposed to. I did everything I was supposed to in preparation and left it on for probably about 4 hrs.. and it still didn't last any longer than about a week. The one thing i didn't do was wipe my skin with the lemon-water solution. That may have some effect on it. Overall good product though.
4,"Fun, easy to use, smells good!","My first impression was that the package itself smelled so good! I assume because of the Eucalyptus? The directions were clear and easy to understand. I put this on about a week ago and did not leave it on as long as I should (not even close to long enough) and it still shows up.My only complain is that it's very hard to squeeze the henna out of the bag in to the bottle without it getting too backed up and spewing up out the top around the sides. I followed the directions, but I lost too much that way. It's possible that I made the hole too big in the bottom of the bag, though, causing this?"
2,Dont practice with toothpaste,They suggest you practice by filling the plastic bottle with toothpaste. Bad idea. It takes forever to get the toothpaste washed out again. Ugh.
4,Great for those that use key cases,"This is a pretty snazzy and signifantly slimmer case than a leather one. The hooks are bendable and may not clip securely, so you have to be careful when attaching keys. Would prefer a 2-snap closure rather than the 1-snap one, but it's a fine case for the price."
2,Unreliable,"Though it's attractive and comfortable, and roomy enough to snap shut on a hefty clutch of keys, the loops pop loose and, after you've reinserted them, they're just looser and looser. Had it three weeks (after years w/ a Coach case)...and I've had it."
4,eels so good,"nice finish, quality construction. Doesn't show it well but single snap closure, a zippered pocket for small items. open pockets on each end flap and a I would recommend this to friends. key attachment via a standard captive hook with hinge. If over time the hook disconnects too easily and releases the key, it can be reverse bent to provide stronger latching. a second layer leather under the key bar can be used for holding ticket stubs and such items."
5,Beautiful,"Completed my set. I love it to serve Paella and other ""stewy"" type foods. Lid keeps things warmer when placing on table. Presents a completed look on table for guests."
5,As Good as Its Wonderful Jacket,Terrific music and lyrics. The one song made want to jump up and grab a shoe! I recommend everyone enjoy at least a bite of this one.
2,Can't tell Red from White,"Sadly, the device itself is not bad -- it fits the space well and the design is solid -- but despite two re-orders of the product -- no one could seem to get it right -- though the product is shown in Red, the order button announced in large letters that the item was ONLY available in white -- fortunately, that was the color we wanted -- but upon each delivery it arrived in the (unavailable?) red color. Even though the Amazon agent re entered the ""corrected"" order it again arrived in Red. So if you have a Red kitchen, go for it -- if not -- lots of luck."
4,Canon Teleconverter,Used with a Tamron 18-270mm lens provided great results but better results if tripod used. Purchased item as cheap option as could not afford a super telephoto lens.
3,2x exrender,"The lens is very good, however, no place in the ads did it mention that this lens was not intended for use with digital cameras. I discovered that the auto focus did not work at all well, but it was usable with manuel focus to some degree. I am somewhat disappointed.................Joe Ehrlich"
3,Blurry Pictures,"I have a Canon 7D with a Tamron 18-270mm zoom lense. I bought this teleconverter because I do not wish to spend thousands and lug a big telephoto lens with me on my trips.As have been reported by other reviewers, I found auto-focusing becomes difficult. Manual focusing is not as easy as others say (perhaps because I am a novice) when the lense is fully zoomed. A slight move of the focusing ring can cause a quiet blurry picture. In general, the images taken with the teleconverter mounted appear to be blurry - not as sharp as without the teleconverter. I am a little disappointed about it in this aspect. However, for the price, there are not many choices.The instruction says to turn off the camera when mounting the converter. When turning it back on the camera automatically resets to proper light metering. I forgot to follow the procedure on my trip to Mexico. All my seabird pictures appear over exposed.I might need to practice more to get used to it."
5,As advertised,"East to use and light. No bigger than my 50mm prime. Used it on my 70-200 L series with a 5D Mark II and don't see much loss in image quality. For the limited time I need such long reach it was more than worth saving the $1000 over a new lens. Only downside is loss in f stop, but that is a known quantity with a teleconverter. Glad I got this one and not the more pricey Canon. Great Product."
4,Adorable character,"She and Mr' Riff should be resurrected. Allegra is adorable. My daughter loved her when she was little, Of course, you can only find this on VHS...DVD doesn't exist."
4,A great tool to put the Word into our kids!,"My almost 5 yr old loves this. The music is catchy and repetitive, and the reading is done very well-passionately and makes it interesting for kids. The music isn't filled with base and guitars (as my son prefers of course) but this is more relaxing (for the car and on in the house without the nerve racking twangs,etc) yet still interesting for them. He's trying to sing along as we speak! I'll be using this in my 2-3 yr old class at church as well as the 4-5yr olds. The songs seem to be sung by girls, so I put a 4 as my son prefers to hear other boys and more ""jamming out"" tunes...but we love it."
5,great memory tool and devotional,"We have been using this every day with my 1, 3, and 5 yr olds for our Bibletime. The verses are short but we usually repeat a ""letter"" for a couple days to be sure they all have it down. There is a Bible story and life application with each verse/letter. The CD is a nice bonus."
4,"not what I wanted, but excellent customer service",My book I ordered had only one out of 2 cd's with it. When I contacted seller they were prompt in correcting the situation and were very generous in doing so. Customer service is excellent.
1,not worth it,I bought this dictionary and was extremely dissapointed. All the words have one short brief definition and some of those definitions were to short to make sense. I wouldn't reccomend this dictionary to anyone. No use spending your money on it.
4,Slim and portable- a great gift,this is a great help to people like me who just can't spell. You can take it anywhere because it is so slim and tiny. The dictionary is also a great help. I use it a lot and haven't had to replace the batteries yet.
2,"Worth the price, [...]","Nothing unique about the cable itself. Similary sized camera etc,, USB mini cable's do the same here. The inlcuded (plagerized?) Motorola Phone Tools CD is a starting point, as you will need it to upgrade 5 or 6 levels to a usable current release for free. Enough said"
1,THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU GET,"The picture that they show you is NOT the bead set that you get. It is half the size, not even the same color beads or anything!!!! Shady dealings, I tell you! The only thing that is the same is the name, the set I got IS called the sweet hearts bead set, it is just 100% not the same set that is pictured BEWARE!!!!"
3,"Good toy, but misrepresented","I didn't know how to rate this product as the bead box I received was nice, but it was definitely not as described. The description on Amazon clearly states ""over 150 beads,"" but the box you get states ""over 70 beads"" right on the packaging. Amazon customer service refunded me promptly which was nice, but it would be nicer if the description was corrected so people know what they're getting."
1,Item is very different than what is described/pictured,"I ordered two Melissa & Doug wooden bead sets for twin girls. One came as pictured; however, this set is not described or pictured accurately. What you get with the Sweet Hearts set is a bead set that is HALF the size of the similar sets, such as a Flower Power set.On the outside of the box, the product states there are over 70 beads, while this items description states over 140 beads. If you look up the Sweet Hearts bead set currently advertised for $6.99, you'll see an accurate picture of what item you will receive. Instead of six large hearts and four separate groups of smaller beads, you'll get three large hearts and only two groups of the smaller beads.Due to the misrepresentation of this item, I do not recommend purchasing. The other Melissa and Doug set looks great and I like the quality, but buying a large set and getting a much smaller one is very disappointing."
4,"Seems like it will be great, and though","I've not given it to the little, soon to be 4-year old, as it's one of her birthday gifts from Grandma. It seems like the pieces are well made and will hold up to repeated stringing. I'm pretty sure it will be well used, once I give it to her."
2,not worth the price,I bought this for a Christmas and was very diappointed. It loked very cheap and I thought it would be better. Not a big fan of Melissa and Doug. They seem to be over-priced and you can get simlar items for less money with the same quality or better.
4,Getting to the heart of worship,"As the title suggests, this book is all about worship as a life style rather than something we do on Sundays. Witt takes you on a journey through Old Testiment worship and its relationship to us today. He also sheds light on what Jesus' death on the cross means for us in terms of living a worship filled life. You don't need a degree in theology to understand this book, but you do need a heart and mind that is ready to be challenged."
5,Great as yoga music,I heard this music during my yoga class at the local recreation center and asked the instructor what it was. I then purchased it on Amazon and have been listening to it in the car and at home. My daughter even listens to it before going to bed to wind down. I love the first song particularly and the title song.
5,Grace CD,Very soothing and stress reducing. She has a beautiful voice and I am very happy with this purchase.
5,I love this!,"Absolutely beautiful music. I became acquainted with this artist in a yoga class. Every song on the album is wonderful and perfect for a yoga class or just relaxation. I used this as part of my ""birthing soundtrack"" and I think it really helped me focus and remain calm."
4,"Orange Goblin -""Frequencies From Planet Ten"".","I had heard and read intriguing things about this U.K. group, but had not had the pleasure of actually listening to them until quite recently, and I was NOT disappointed. Check out these tracks - 'Saruman's Wish"", ""Land of Secret Dreams"", ""Orange Goblin"",,,aww heck, the whole thing's actually quite good. I've heard it classified as ""stoner rock"", but I think that might a term more commonly in use in the U.K.. If you like HEAVY-duty, fuzzy, Sabbath-inspired, retro-style space-metal with wild and spacey lyrics, you will LOVE these guys. The band is obviously very talented. I'd love to hear them played on North American radio more commonly. Makes METALLICA sound like whiney babies.Cheers!Simon"
4,Less articulation means better toy for younger children.,"This character is fairly sturdy and my 2 year old (almost 3) plays with it. He enjoys that the arms and legs move, but hasn't been able to take apart the toy yet. I think it is better for him than toys with more moving parts."
3,get the Vintage one,Do yourself a favor and buy the Vintage version of Ponda Baba instead of this one. It's a lot better and has a removable arm. You can find the vintage version here:Star Wars 3.75 Vintage Figure Ponda Boba
1,Not a Trip to Heaven,"Very simply put, I like 80's rock, I liked the first couple of 707 albums. This is NOT a 707 album, but rather a Kevin Russell album. The two are not the same thank you. If you are buying this thinking you will get that nostalgic 707 sound, you will be sadly mistaken."
4,Great Teapot!!!!!,"I bought this teapot for my mother and she loved it as soon as she saw it. The delivery was amazingly fast. I didn't think my mom was going to get it for her birthday, since I ordered it so close to the date. But, I was very surprised and happy that she received the packed one her birthday. It's perfect for tea and my mom is using it frecuently. It's beatuiful and at such a great price. I saved money by buying this teapot and with the money I saved I bought my mom some tea and a tea tin!!!! :) It's a great gift at a reasonable price."
2,Cannot boil water in it?,"This seems like something that should be in the description. I wanted a cast iron teapot for boiling and steeping tea. The instructions that I have only now after purchasing and opening tell you to not boil water in it. Isn't the exact purpose for any cast iron cookware to be able to use it over a strong flame? Or for a tetsubin, over charcoal?Beautiful teapot, but should come with the warning:Officially may not be used for boiling water.Since it does not do exactly what I bought it to do, and there is no indication of this in the description, this receives 2 stars. If the pot was designed for boiling water, it would get 5."
3,"again, simple, but loved by my son","This allows my son to smash things or blow em up, build things, and make pictures. OK, relatively mindless, but he loves it and can interact instead of passing watching the TV.Recommended with these limitations in mind. It is a good deal in this day and age when taking your kids to the movies can bust the budget."
5,so much fun,"im 17 now but i loved this game when i was little, in the dump truck part when you had to pump it up with air, my brother and my friends kept blowing up the tires, and the lunch break was sick. ooo why dont you try that again hahahahahh"
1,"If you like Ricky Martin, get Ricky Martin!","Bomba and Livin' la Vida Loca are actually pretty good songs... as sung by Ricky Martin. But the versions on this sorry excuse for a CD are not in the same league. They're not nearly as bad as, say, William Hung's rendition of She Bangs, but why waste your time listening to second-rate singers and *synthesized* horns? And these are probably the best tracks on the CD, which doesn't actually contain much real salsa despite the title. Avoid."
5,Truly wonderful...,"This is a wonderful collection of Drake's works. It provides an insight into what makes his work truly stand out from the crowd. The Vietnam stories are among his earliest works and are stunning. ""Have you ever seen a Sheridan burn?"" is forever etched into my memory."
3,Good short stories of war,"Most of these stories were pretty good. I was surprised by the fantasy parts in some of these stories because I expected all of them to be mostly sci-fi / military. The stories that were set in Viet Nam were all pretty good. Drake's leaning on Mech. Infantry gets old, he should write about light fighters too. The story about fraging the LT was great. The soldier justified killing another man because his buddy was killed while sneaking a joint while on a mission. He was sneaking it cause the LT wouldn't allow dope. So his buddies death is blamed on the Lieutenant. Classic!I like that Drake doesn't make villians out of many of his officers. Most are soldiers that have earned the confidence and respect of their men by being charismatic and competant. We would all like to work for that kind of officer.I give this 3 stars because I like it. The 4th star is for great and the stories just didn't get me there"
2,millions of pieces,"Its greatto look at once you've spent two hours putting it together. After all the intricate pieces are put together, you better hope your four year old does not drop it. My husband builds computers and said this takes extensive assembly. You also need to hope once you've taken the time to put it together that they didn't leave a small piece out. I do not recommend this toy for a child whose wanting to be able to play with it right away or the same day for that matter."
5,I LOVE IT,"It's a bartenders DREAM.. I bought it 3 years ago to remove crumbs and food off a marble bartop, it works like a charm. It doesn't work well on a table cloth... becuase of the design of air flow."
2,IT DOESN'T WORK!,"I received my crumb catcher a few days ago, put the batteries in and __ NOTHING! I have been trying everything to get it work - it also didn't come with any type of instructions - I will try and contact the manufacturer but all this for a crumb catcher!!"
1,It didn't work out of the box.,"I do have one which works fine, but this one was DOA. And hard to open. No proper instructions. Trudeau (maker) couldn't have been more helpful, but guess I got a lemon--which makes return at this low price a bother..."
1,Crummy Sweeper does not work at all,"Package arrived, popped batteries in, the motor doesn't spin. Fiddled with contacts reversed polarity, basic troubleshooting shows I've got a bum product. Quality control?"
3,Very Nice,"The first two cuts are my favorites. Simple and moving, I love to listen to them over and over again. When I first heard ""The Whales Journey"" I began searching for the CD to add to my collection. I am glad I finally found it at Amazon! The rest of the CD is nicely done, but as I stated before, the first two cuts are the best!"
3,Cute but frustrating,"We gave this set to our 3 1/2 year old daughter for Christmas. The critters are adorable; however, we are disappointed with the Backyard Swing & Playset. The critters will not stay on the swing - they either fall off, or the swing tips over when they are on. It is also difficult to get the critters to stay on the see-saw. Overall, my 3 1/2 year old became frustrated because she could not get the critter to stay on the swing & playset. She ended up using the critters in the Littlest Pet Shop sets and in the Fisher Price Lovin' Family Twin Time dollhouse. On the plus side, it does appear to be sturdy and is very cute."
3,"different, but fun","This set is different than the other calico critters in that it's unpainted wood, but the quality is good. It is difficult to get the critters to swing or teeter-totter, but my 4-year old daughter uses other little friends that fit better. She is thrilled to have a realistic playground and plays with it as much as all the other items in her calico critters collection."
4,Fun for toddlers!,"My little girl loves this toy! The only problems we've had have come from our cats (who can't seem to resist carrying around the tiny fuzzy Calico Critters!). If your child enjoys playing pretend games with toys, this is nearly perfect."
5,10 STARS,This is one of the best bands to come out in a while!! They have such a clean perfect sound. I stumbled upon them and decided to try them out and now I can't wait for more. When you hear it for the first time you'll be in love.
1,Do not buy this item!,"Those seeking Yuli Raizman and Elizaveta Svilova's famous 1945 documentary should know that this item is being sold under false pretenses. This is a 2005 film using old footage prepared by Chronos Films. It is NOT the Soviet original, contrary to what Amazon says on its website. I was fooled but hopefully you will not be.--SL, NYC"
4,The Fall of Berlin,I have read several critical reviews and beg to differ. Who but the postwar Germans would be least inclined to make biased statements or to seek a propaganda outlet for their production? This documentary is the best historic account of their final battle in WWII.
4,I love Lew Fonesca,"I thoroughly enjoy the character of Lew Fonesca, especially his relationship with his counsel or as well as the other partners in crime."
4,As good as it gets,All of the cookie presses have issues. This Norpro is the easiest most consistent press that I have used. Better than the Swiss and German units that I have used in the past. Don't buy ANY of the plastic ones!Would buy this one again
3,Norpro 3301 Deluxe Cookie Press Review,"Over all I give this 3 stars, the handel is cheap and it has alot of aluminum in it - which I thought was not good for the price. It works fine and has a lot of different disks which are really fun. I'm still looking for the perfect press, though."
2,User Unfriendly,"I should have known, after using my daughter`s identical press, as it does not perform with ease. I will get another plastic press like the one I was happy with until it broke. The ""adjustment"" for 2 different sizes is deceptive. The 2nd is too big, the 1st is too small, & if that isn`t bad enough, the dough will not release onto the pan surface. Having made cookies with a press for over 40 years, I realize there are many variables that can affect this process, such as pan surface temp, & dough consistency, etc. No matter which ones I have tried, the outcome is, very frustratingly, the same. It should not be such an ordeal. I liked the 20 different die choices, but ended up only using the ones that pump out dough strips."
4,Norpro 3301 Deluxe Biscuit/Cookie Press,This cookie press works very well. However it is too expensive and the cookie designs are not familiar to me.
2,"What does ""delexe"" mean?","This is more a model and packaging review than a product review. I ordered the higher cost deluxe model assuming/thinking it came with the cake decorating nozzles in addition to the discs. But it was just the standard model with the press and 20 discs. Moreover, it did not appear ""used"", but it appeared the box had been open and the cookie press had been handled. The handle had fingerprints on it. Perhaps a returned product? There was no packing cardboard inside. Just the press, small box of dics, and a boolet. Haven't tried it yet. The press is rated high, and I assume/hope will work well. But there is no reason to buy this ""deluxe"" model from the this seller compared to the lower cost regular model from other suppliers. No apparent differnce, and costs more."
1,Dough won't come out of the press,"I decided to buy this cookie press based on Amazon reviews, but am very disappointed. I use an old family Spriz recipe which uses butter and the cookies would not stick to my cookie sheet. They got stuck in the press and I had to pry them out, which ruined the shape of the cookies. So I'm back to square one, sending this one back."
2,used item?,"I received it with three other items. The package of this item was a bit decayed and damaged. Inside wrapping was opened and appear to be ""used"" (this was advertised as ""new""). Other items are just as expected."
3,Norpro vs Marcato,"I thought I was ordering a Norpro product, but what I got was a Marcato product. Is this the way that Norpro does their selling. I haven't tried the product yet,so can't tell you the outcome."
1,Very disappointed,The lever on this is very cheap; every 2nd or 3rd cookie it failed to catch and I had to reset it. It was incredibly frustrating to use and I eventually gave up. I'm sending mine back.
2,Stainless steel except for a critical part,The end of the plunger is plastic which doesn't hold up to pressing cookie dough. Replaced the part and still only good for a limited time.Doc
3,"Not stainless steel, it's aluminum.","I received the biscuit maker a few days ago and much to my surprise it is not made out of stainless steel. It is made out of aluminum, which is the material is was trying to avoid. This item is unfortunately advertised incorrectly. I am therefore returning it to amazon."
4,Love it.....,"I love making cookies with a press and every year I would buy a Wilton because the year before it broke. I finally got sick of Wilton and tried this cookie press. I followed their directions and in 20 mintues all the cookies were ready for the oven. I had no problem with the device itself, worked as they said it would. 2 clicks for large cookies and the cookies were down. No cookies stuck, easy to reload and the leaver does not require a body builder to squeeze.Perfect, love it."
2,I STAND CORRECTED!!! REVISION TO MY INITIAL REVIEW!,I was very disappointed with the quality of this cookie press..It was advertised as Stainless Steel when in fact its aluminum I think for the money I could have done a lot better and thought that perhaps because it was made in Italy it was going to be a better press then I received..December 2008...Ok folks..I stand corrected!..even though I was disappointed in this cookie gun...I used it for the first time this year..and it pumped out the most perfect little cookies in no time flat!..it was easy to use...and I wish the tube was a bit larger...the discs are great and I made lots of great little cookies...I am glad I didnt return it!
2,"Extremely dated, but gives some historical perspective","The ""nationalities question"" is a moot point in the 21st century, as the Soviet Union fractured into its various national groups - a point that the book discussed (while there still was a ""Soviet Union"".) The fact that the book deals with the Soviet Union's politics while the Soviet Union was extant is its greatest flaw - as such, it really has no purpose anymore.However, mnay of the points and issues brought up and discussed remain relevant in the region - specifically the importance and influence of Islam in what was once ""Soviet central Asia"" (ie. Uzbekistan, Khazakhstan, Turkmenistan), and the inter-ethnic conflicts in the oil-rich Caucasus (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia). There are better books that deal with events more recently (Moscow's Muslim Challenge by Rykwin comes to mind). For those seeking some historical perspective it has its worth, albiet limited worth."
5,This is good. 2008 HHR,I ordered a different company kit first. The metro is a better idea and installed better. The tray is locked on. I liked that. This held a replacement JVC radio with bluetooth for my 2008 Chevy HHR.
2,you get what you pay for,"This product did fit my 2006 chevy cobalt ls but the fit and finish is janky at best. there are absolutely no screws or instruction manuals. This was a real pain due to the fact that the sony system i was installing did not fit in the space provided( and stuck out). I had to use the spacer provided which really doesn't fit the product( too large for the opening and bows inward in the center. Had sony not provided a outer case for their unit with tabs that fold out to tighten the player in, there would be no way to mount it to the dashboard without it pulling out. The side brackets are trash and there are very large gaps between the stock face and the body. Just look elsewhere."
5,strongly recommended....,"Picked this one up as an afterthought while in my favorite second hand bookstore here in Tasmania. Read it in two days and then went straight back and read it again. I've read a few books in my time and I've never done that. I was going to give it 4 stars because almost all of your reviews for your books are 5 star but this one most definately deserves 5. I enjoy a good war story and this is one of the best. Hang on tight as you go along on this white knuckle ride with a ragtag team of LRRPS behind enemy lines in vietnam. Just coming out alive is a victory in itself. A word of warning to finish, don't lend it to anyone because you will not get it back."
5,Great stuff,This is the best shea butter I have used. It is absorbed quickly and doesn't leave that sticky residue that most shea butters leave on your skin.
3,pleasant scent; don't like absorption,"I'm a huge shea butter fan, which is what led me to order this product. I feel it's just OK. I like the scent: just barely there, clean and pleasant. I guess I wish the product absorbed more quickly. I prefer my skin feeling smooth immediately after I apply moisturizer. That doesn't happen with this product: when I run my fingers over immediately afterwards, they skip. After 1-2 hours, however, my fingers do run smoothly over the entire area. For an alternative shea butter moisturizer, I prefer L'Occitane's Ultra Rich Body Cream. You'll pay more than for J. R. Watkins, but I feel it's worth it."
2,Kind of dissapointed,not enough shae butter. I have very dry sensitive skin and shae help just not enough in this .
1,Hot & spicy? How about ice cold & tasteless!,"I actually made the colossal mistake of buying the three CD compilation that includes this particular piece of solidified dung. The instruments are synthesized, the singing is bad and there's only one actual salsa song (track 9), despite the title. Don't waste your money and especially don't waste time listening to it. Those precious moments will be lost forever!"
5,Let me just say this my friends....,"If you are not a beliver in the Dish Miesters, Get ready to bow down.... I found out today, that Ali and Shahram are nomenated agin this year for another Grammy...... Oh ya.... for remixers of the year.....Second year in a row... now that is realy something.....THe song that they are nominated for is on this cd, On the first cd number 9...Didos Thank and the mix on this cd has never been released so you can only get it here..... Enjoy...and belive in the greatest DUo in dance history.... Deep Dish"
3,I liked the convenience of the cans. The ...,"I liked the convenience of the cans. The flavor was OK, but not as good as the Slim Fast powder. I'd definitely buy this product again."
3,These shakes taste great! Even if someone wasn't ...,"These shakes taste great! Even if someone wasn't trying to lose weight, this would be a great snack, with the added benefit that it's very nutritious. I'd recommend them to anyone just looking for a good snack. They'd also be great for people who feel like they don't have time to eat. However, I think it's pretty unrealistic to think of these as meal replacements. I tried having one instead of breakfast, and even though I'm not a big eater, I was starving by 10:30. So I don't think that these would make a good diet -- unless you can handle being hungry all the time."
4,"Great product, but no substitute for discipline","Slim-fast tastes great and is a good source of vitamins for the dieter. However, it will not leave you 'satisfied'. It won't help your resist hunger, so don't expect that. And of course, any diet plan is doomed for failure without generous exercise."
3,"Good for the home, where it's quiet (hopefully)","Great in quiet environments. However, with the microphone relatively far from your mouth, the high sensitivity of the mic picks up lots of background noise. Road noise was unacceptably loud while talking to my wife in her car.If you're using this device exclusively at home without the TV in the backgound, you can't beat the comfort of this almost featherweight headphone."
2,Awful transmission quality,"I'm back to Amazon to try to find a higher quality replacement for this earphone. I get numerous complaints about the terrible quality of my ""cellphone"" and my ""cellphone signal"" when using this product. When leaving others messages the message is typically inaudible.I am now at the point where I only use this product when checking my voicemail."
4,Mildly fruity flavor,This is a good tea but it doesn't have as much of the fruit flavor as the other Ahmad teas I've tried. I drink these teas iced so the more fruit flavor the better they taste.
4,Delish!,"Ever since Williams-Sonoma created a tea for each season about a dozen years ago, I've been searching for a tea as good as their (now discontinued) Summer Tea, which was flavored with mango, passionfruit and had marigold petals in it. This one is about as close as I've come...it has lots of fruity/slightly floral/peachy flavor and is excellent iced. The price is good and it should last all summer. My only gripe is that it's not really a green product b/c EACH teabag is individually wrapped...really not necessary. Also, I agree with the reviewer who said that this tea is better than the plain peach tea. Enjoy!!"
1,My three year old did not respond well to it,"I purchased this book w/tape at a african american bookstore in Atlanta expecting this book and music to really expose my child to her heritage but my three year old hates it and would rather hear her old nursery rymes tapes. I thought it would be a variety of african drums and alittle kids rap as well as gospel. All the songs sounds like slave songs or either white opera singers, I was disappointed with this book and tape."
2,It was okay,"I thought this was a movie about an independant trucker, not really. It is more of a goofy kind of love story. I think women and children might like it better. I watched it once after buying it, and have not had the desire since. I am a fan of Robert Blake, but not so much this film. If you want to see a great early movie of his, check out electra glyde in blue."
3,Coast To Coast Vhs Movie.,"Coast to Coast is an Okay movie. Trucker Flick with a Cool GMC General Sleeper truck, mediocre acting and actors. silly plot. Robert Blake the Murderer is in it. I just got the movie at a cheap price originally before the whole blake thing because of te GMC truck in it. It's no Smokey and The Bandit and Certainly not Convoy. Yet still fun to watch.I guess I hate romantic Comedies."
1,Norton Utilities sucks,"Do not buy this program. I bought this program for my boyfriend for christmas. Its not good at defragging (he had to do it twice in 2 weeks so far), and the disc utility can be harmful or even fatal to a mac computer. When we found this out it was removed right away. Also Norton is discontinuing the product and concentrating on making virus protection. Why is this being discontinued if its supposedly a good product? i promise if you get this program you will regret it."
3,glove liners,"I bought these for a costume, not to use as actual glove liners, but I wasn't particularly impressed. Unfortunately I couldn't find any wrist-length black gloves made from a silky fabric, so I had to get these instead. I wore them a total of three times (I'd guess less than five hours altogether) before I noticed a small hole on one of the fingers, right along the seam. They didn't see any rough use before that point, so I was a little disappointed.If you don't mind that the workmanship isn't spectacular, these work alright. They fit my hands very well (I have small hands, so this has been a problem in the past), and the fabric feels nice on my skin. If you're looking for something to work out long-term, though, you may want to look elsewhere."
4,These are warm,I wear these liners in my running gloves and they really stop the wind from coming through. My hands stay dry also. I am a little disappointed that I have a hole in one of the fingers already but they are inside so I'm fine with the hole until spring.
4,ok product,"They don't warm much on their own, but they are nice enough. I guess liners aren't meant to be warm..."
5,"Very warm, excellent liners for motorcycle gloves!","These silk liners are great for motorcycle gloves just keep them away from velcro otherwise they pill and get fuzzy. I just got these and they have been keeping my hands really warm even with my lightweight fall gloves. If you have winter gloves, these will definitely keep your hands warm on those cold days or long rides. Good (not great) wind blocking capability. Not overly thin like the ones I bought from LL Bean."
5,Silky warmth to add to summer gloves,"These silk glove liners perform exactly how I hoped. I ride a BMW motorcycle that has a full fairing and heated grips. My favorite riding gloves are deerskin ropers, which work well in 3 seasons but since they are unlined do not offer much cold weather protection. Even with the fairing and the heated grips my summer gloves do not work well below 40 degrees. These silk liners are thin enough my ropers still fit fine over them, and the liners give just a tad more protection. The combination of the heated grips, silk liners, and ropers combined with the fairing giving some wind protection means I can ride comfortably down to 30 degrees. (If I use heavy duty winter gloves I lose dexterity, and do not get the benefit of the heated grips.) If I was still riding a HD motorcycle without a fairing these would be ok in the 40-55 degree range I think."
5,Great Gloves,"These gloves are very warm, fit great, and the price is right. They wash well too. Very prompt delivery.Lynn Jones"
2,pretty pathetic...,"It is very poor quality and almost an entire waste of money had it not provided some level of protection.Within 2 days of wearing it, the threads on the material start coming out....Will never buy again.."
2,Mine came with snagged fingers,"I don't trust these other reviews being that my pair came with a few snagged fingers. I was given a refund because of that though, but I don't want to waste my time again trying to get a proper pair for cold weather. I didn't give it one star because they make amazing facial skin sloughers, but that wasn't what I bought these for. If they were sold as facial skin sloughers, I would have given them four stars, still minus one though because the finger tips were snagged."
5,Parallels -- then and now,"Having been raised primarily towards the end of the Cold War, and as an officer in the military, I actually read this as a primer for how to counter the contemporary terrorist/ radical Islam narrative. Fascinating read."
2,Broken already,"Got it in a timely manner, worked perfectly for several weeks, but is already broken. It's a great product as a stand alone, but I don't think it's durable enough to keep on your key chain."
5,Cheap and Effective,"For the price, these are excellent for gifts in the workplace. I bought 20x and we are ordering another round.Package does come with 4 batteries, but only 3 required. 3 is the optimal number. I did not use the light much, but the laser pointer worked well."
3,"Good light, Short battery","When I got this it came in a package with 4 batterys not 3, making me think it would last even longer, i was wrong. The battery became really low after only a few uses, making it so the light no longer traveled as bright, and to top it off it doesnt come with spares. Id suggest getting one with better battery power or otherwise get spare batterys.Thank you, Ryan"
3,better or worse,"A collection of short individual life stories that demonstrate personal marriage applications from a variety of writers. Not a dymamic book, but will bring empathy from those in similar situations."
5,A great tale of courage and hope.,"This book was really good, soon has I started reading it I couldn't put it down. 11 yr. old Chandra is to marry a 16 yr. old boy through an arranged marriage. Everything is like a fairytale for Chandra, until she goes to visit her husband's family, her fairytale turns into a living nightmare! I say no more, read this book you will truly enjoy it."
5,stirred and stirring,"The necessary ingredients for this romantic novel ae stirred and stirring i a unique setting---the hubb of the Grand National Rodeo and Horse Show held annually at the world famous Cow Palace. The question is:Can such a backdrop of horses,bulls, sheep and performing dogs nourish true loves of Lsabeth and Jamie? Guthertz brings many familiar Grand National into focus rwith this close-up behind the chutes, look at action and competitive skills."
2,BEWARE! Will not work in many burners!,"Amazon doesn't state this, but this will NOT work in any burners which are slower than 16x burn speed! I ended up eating eight bucks on shipping as a result. I'm sure the discs are quality, Verbatim's never let me down, but buyer beware -- don't get these if you don't have a high speed drive, they'll be useless to you!"
4,Diomedes,I found this book inspiring. My older brother was a priest and he recommended this book to me. Diomedes was a great man and a wonderful priest. I recommend this book to anyone. Good Read.
2,Review,This book is very outdated but does have some useful information. This is the only book I was able to find that talked about how people can use computers in the medical field.
4,Muellar PVC Gate Valve,Muellar #100-107 1-1/2 PVC Gate ValveReceived in good condition and within delivery schedule.
1,Workshopped to death,"As a page turner this book does its job. A deliberate hook at the end of the chapter, forced if necessary. Hooks that are sometimes there for the sake of, completely against the flow of the piece. And that is the problem with this book. It is too workshopped and it sounds workshopped. There is no spark of originality, no unique voice, indeed no voice at all. It is bland bland bland!"
1,Doesn't work,"I purchased eBlaster to monitor my teens computer use and time on various web sites. Oddly, it kept reporting no use, even though I saw him on web sites. Turns out it can only monitor internet explorer, which the kids don't use any more. They use google chrome. Doesn't work with Google Chrome and I can't get a refund. Spectorsoft doesn't monitor other browsers either. So make sure you know what browsers are being used! Ask if the product can see that browser."
3,BUYER BEWARE!,"BUYER BEWARE! When I tried to install this software, I had some problems getting it to work. I called the software support number and was told that there was an update and this version is no longer supported by the manufacturer. I was told that this version has a problem installing correctly if ant-virus software is also running. Turning off anti-virus software will allow for a proper install. Otherwise the software appears to be working well. I was also offered a discount to upgrade to the newer version and was told that the above mentioned problem had been fixed in the new version."
2,Program disables itself every few years,I first purchased the program for about 99.95 and then after about 2 years it stopped working. When I contacted them they said I needed to upgrade and I did at their discounted 69.95. It just happened again.....and I contacted them and again I need another upgrade for 69.65! I removed the program myself...one should not have to pay 69.95 every 2 years if that's the case they should tell you up front!
1,try another program,"Eblaster is the worst program out there, besides that it has flaws and isn't reliable, they keep sucking money out of their customers.every 2 years they disable the program and when you call they say you have to buy the latest version! i asked i would like to keep using the one i have, they said you have to pay for support, but old versions are being disabled!"
1,24/7 support useless when they cant be bothered to check your account details.,"Lost email account and the key for continued use. Wrote to Spectorsoft outlining the problems and said I could answer questions regarding the account or purchase. This is the reply I received:""Hello,I am sorry but for security reasons we can only reply to the email address on file for an account.. Please resubmit your request directly from the email address you registered with us at time of purchase. SteveG.""Thats bull."" If I don't check this stuff you wont need to buy another licence."" Yeah, I hear you Steve.kind of like having a pet snake.Not an honourable company."
4,Worth the money,"I put this in a 2001 camry, and it made a big difference. It was like I was driving a different car I did the hood, doors, floor, and later I tried doing the trunk but did not have enough to finish it. Actually installing it is a breeze. Cut it with a utility knife, remove the backing, and put it down. Then just roll over it with a roller of some kind to make sure it grips. For tricky shapes, I used paper or cardboard templates. Even if you make a mistake cutting, it hardly matters. Cut it too big? Just cut some more away. Cut it too small? Just add some more. This is not a job to do when it is ten degrees outside. Wait till spring or summer when the Dynamat is easier to work with. It's no wonder Jay Leno and other serious car restorers use this stuff. It works! Depending on the car you're working on, disassembly could take some time, but it's worth it. Getting the bulk pack is the way to go - much cheaper in the long run."
5,Dynamat Bulk Pack,Excellent product. Reduced road noise in my 1994 Ford Taurus quite a bit. Glad I did it.
3,"OK, but not worth the price tag","I did an install of this product covering the full trunk section of my 2012 Camaro.The sound does muffle out a bit but the cost for effectiveness was not where I believe it should be.It did work well for rattles and when the car is not running or moving, there is a clear improvement in the sound quality coming from the rear end. The Bass does not rattle but gives a nice solid sound as I think it should be.I have not used other products so I am not able to give a comparison, but I imagine I will try other brands who claim to be as good or better and sometimes at a lower price."
4,Dynamat Xtreme,"I got this product on the recommendation of a friend that restores cars. A bit expensive, but does seem to do a good job in deading the sound. Waiting until I get the car on the road to see how in does in insulation value. Gave it only 4 stars because I'm not convinced that it has good insulation value. For the price of this stuff, I would think that it should also have a layer of urethane foam. Installation went OK but as show room as you see in advertisements. They must have spent hours to get it looking perfect."
1,Disappointed in Dynamat,"I have never used such a product prior and due to the fact that my 2011 Golf had a lot of road noise I wanted to give a shot.Per many of the reviews the hatch area is supposed to cause 60% of the noise.I applied the product all over the hatch area and the rear wheel wells. While this was a fair amount of work I heard almost NO improvement in road noise.I then applied the product underneath the front carpets and wheels wells also in order to reduce front bound noise.There was a slight improvement overall. But nothing ground breaking or even noticeable by those that haven't ridden in the car prior. I used 80% of the kit supplied and I frankly can't say that it was worth the time and money spent.I think whoever reviews this product saying it does wonders to speakers, road noise etc, is suffering from a fairly profound placebo effect.I would say my car went from a D to a C when it comes to road noise and therefore I can not say that it worked as advertised."
2,I expected more.,I really hear no difference in sound deadening claims. It may minimize rattles but doesnt seem to have quieted road noise.
5,shhh,This stuff works well in damping the vibrations out of my panel van. Quiet. Easy install. Really sticky. Get a roller to install for a better fit.
2,Not convinced yet,"I used the Xtreme liner in conjunction with the Dynapad on the floor and rear wall of my truck. I was mostly hoping to dampen the road and exhaust noise, so I didn't apply it to the door panels. The Xtreme is easy to apply and cut. The Dynapad is 1/2"" thick and slightly more difficult to work with. Overall, it's an easy install, but requires some patience. Unfortunately, I didn't notice any results. The noise is just as intrusive as ever. I'm not sure this product is worth the hype."
2,Not Convinced,"Dynamat Xtreme was a product that I had high hopes for, given the information on the company's website and the testimonials from people like Chip Foose and Jay Leno. However, after installing it on my truck (I also installed the Dynapad) to dampen my loud aftermarket truck exhaust, I wasn't very impressed. In fact, I noticed an increase in exhaust noise so profound it made my vehicle unbearable on long trips. A representative of the company pointed out that after installing the product some noises may seem more pronounced due to a decrease in overall noise. This was hardly the answer I was hoping for after spending hundreds of dollars and many hours on installation. I cannot recommend this product because the the results achieved seem slight when compared with the price. It may be a good investment for older cars, but I'd be wary."
2,"misleading pic.....do the math, YOU CANT ISOLATE MUCH WITH 9 sheets","dynamat bulk pack consist of 9 sheets of its product,you need at least 4 ( if your car is a sedan ) or 8 sheets depending of how many doors you want to isolate----so whats left ? 1 sheet for the whole car???? LOOK closely to the pic in DX bulk pack ,it shows the 2 front doors, the roof and all the trunk full with dynamt, not even close as i stated you need at least 4 for the front door, at least 2.5 for the trunk door so your left basically with 2.5 sheets for the rest of your trunk!! that wont isolate even half of it and forget about the roof thats just for the pic--in order to comply with this pic you would need at least 18 sheets or double of what they offer.i'll like to admit I MADE THE MISTAKE of not looking carefully into what 9 sheets of dynamat can cover BUT as a customer you think you can trust a serius company in what its product shows it can cover.....to bad, as i said at the beginning VERY MISLEADING."
1,Poor Quality,This product came in poor condition... the sheets were badly wrinkled and the tar like material had oozed out around the edges. I had to use because of timing but it was very difficult and messy to install and may not perform as well as material I purchased earlier.Bob
2,Dont Just get 1 box,I bought this under the impression that 1 box would do the trick. But infact I needed 3.5 boxes to line my whole car. (2door coupe) 142$ project turned into a $500 one. The product is good just so expensive for glorified tar and foil.
5,Awesome. Great price.,"The Dynamat was easy to install and works great. For a typical interior including doors and trunk, you will need two bulk packs."
2,It works but...,After installing this product i did notice an improvement on the noise reduction but not as much as advertised.
3,For my Cousin,"I bought this for my Cousin to put into his muscle car. Personally, I think it was a waste of money, but he wouldn't listen. He likes it, but most likely a placibo effect."
1,Maybe ineffective,"I have severe lactose intolerance (not an allergy, ""just"" intolerant) and I usually use the ""Ultra"" form of this product. However, since I used to be okay with the ""Original"" strength Lactaid, I thought this might be more economical, even if I had to take multiple tablets. I was wrong. For some reason, these tablets just didn't work for me, even when I took 3 or 4 tablets for something that would be managed by a single ""Ultra"" tablet.So, if you are really sensitive to dairy products, then you're better off with ""Ultra"" Lactaid, rather than ""Original"" Lactaid."
3,"Be aware - each dose is THREE pills, not one","So while I thought I was getting a bargain with a 120 count box, I was really getting FORTY doses, not 120, because the dosage requires 3 pills, not just one. They work fine, but it would have helped me to know before I ordered the caplets that three were required for every time they were needed. It doesn't mention that in the description."
2,lactaid caplets,"The chew-able tablets, worked much better for me. These are not as good as the original product. This appeared to be a good deal for 120, but it's not. You don't save any money."
5,Long time user - Still works great,"I have been using this product for over 30 years, and it still works great for me. You do have to remember to take them just before eating. I carry a small container (empty chap stick tube) of them in my pocket. This makes it cheaper and easier to carry than buying the individually packaged pills which are not as well protected."
1,Caplets are duds for me - DO NOT BUY CAPLET form !,I used the other form - Vanilla flat pills - and they work AND taste great.This caplet form does NOTHING to help me but take $15 from my wallet ! It's as if you didn't take it. What did they put in it ? Chalk?Apologize for my bad tone - but lactose intolerance is very inconvenient and makes you hit the bathroom in 5 to 10 min.The company needs to REFORMULATE THIS PRODUCT !
2,Doesn't really work,does not really work wellinstead of prevent you from going to the bathroomjust makes you go latter.rated 2 stars because makes the symptoms to come latter but not trulystops it.It May work for some people that are not highly intolerant.
2,Old-style Lactaid caught me offguard,"Thought the deal was too good. And then I discovered that I had ordered original Lactaid, not Fast Act, Tried, within 30 minutes or less of order, to cancel, but it was already too late. While I know you strive for being quicker than quick, I would have appreciated a grace period of time to cancel this order. In any case, have a good day. HHK"
2,Not very happy,"I bought this product to use on my sealed hardwood floors. It is cumbersome and bulky to use. Also, it does not pick up all of the dirty water so you have to ""dry"" the foor with a terry mop which adds yet another step to the already long process - vacuum, wet scrub, water removal, plus dry with terry mop. I'll stick with my old cleaning method of spritz floor with cleaner and mop with terry mop. My floors didn't look any better when I used the floormate! :-("
2,Not good on grout,"I purchased this floor cleaner specifically to use on the white tile floor and (formerly) white grout. It did a great job cleaning the tile itself. Unfortunately, it did not make a bit of difference on the grout, which is just as dirty as it was before I cleaned it with the Hoover floor cleaner. It looks like I'll be on my hands and knees with the bleach and toothbrush afterall - - very disappointing!"
4,Great tile cleaner,"Just got the H3030 for my birthday and tried it last night... thrilled with it. I have so much tile that I couldn't bear to use a mop anymore. Also have a 9-month old crawling all over the tile and a 4-year old messy eater. I couldn't believe how dirty the water was after this puppy cleaned my tile. Can't believe my baby was crawling all over that! I will be using this Hoover a lot (I'm sortof a clean freak).The only reason I am giving this a 4 rating is because the little float thingy that alerts the unit that your tank is full will stop the suction and it happens when the tank is NOT full. You have to turn the unit off for 10 seconds and turn it back on to get rolling again. That happened a little more often than I'd like.Also, the instructions don't mention how fast/slow to go over the floor. But you figure out pretty quick to go very slow and let the scrub brushes do their work.I really do LOVE this thing. What a great birthday gift from my husband! NO MORE MOPPING FOR ME!"
3,Not as good as I hoped it would be...,"the vacuum loses suction at times, and I have to turn it off and restart it in order to get it to work again. When it does work, it does a great job scrubbing the floors. Not sure why it is losing suction, I cleaned out all tanks, but it still has problems."
4,Really good product!,"I read all the reviews on this floor cleaner, along with reviews on the others available in the Hoover line. This got the best reviews by far, and I could see why as soon as it arrived. It assembled easily, was easy to use, and did a good job on my hardwood, and vinyl floors. No, it's not perfect, nothing is, but it beats the heck out of getting down on your hand and knees. You can't beat this one!"
1,Does not work nearly as well as the original,"After reading the other reviews, I am wondering if I have a defective model. Here is our experience with this machine:We've had a floormate since 2001. We loved our original floormate, so when it conked out, we bought this model. It DOES NOT clean the floors, at all! The ""new and improved"" brushes don't even touch the floor most of the time. It doesn't suck up the excess water as well as the older one, so you're basically just pushing dirty water around the floor. We are so dissapointed, we've went back to cleaning on our hands and knees."
5,Hoover H3030 FloorMate SpinScrub 500 Floor Cleaner,Very easy to use. Timely shipping to meet the holiday need. Excellent product - would highly recommend.
3,Hoover Floor Cleaner - Not Perfect,"I found the Hoover H3030FloorMate SpinScrub 500 Floor Cleaner to be a basically effective cleaner, however, I have several reservations. Its worst characteristic is inconsistency in the pickup/drying function. Generally, the floor comes out clean, but sometimes the pickup (of water) works, and sometimes it doesn't. The unit is heavy, nd somewhat difficult to manuever as a result. I think that if the drying function was corrcted, I would absolutely love this machine."
1,Useless,"Well I guess I'll be the thorn among the roses, but I am so disappointed w/ this machine that I could scream. And have many times. I don't use this machine to vacuum, since I already have a vacuum that does a better job, I only needed it as an alternative to scrubbing on hands & knees. It does a poor job of getting up the grime in the crevices of my vinyl floor (the grout brush is only somewhat helpful. The flat brush is useless.) And vacuuming up the dirty water is a tedius process. Half the time I end up wiping down the whole floor with an old towel. To me this is just another machine that sadly doesn't live up to its expensive promises."
1,Don't waste your money,I've had the floormate for nearly a year and am finally sending it to the dump where it belongs. It is flimsy and poorly constructed. Every part of it that can clog does; consequently its suction is practically worthless after just a few passes. I can sweep and mop my entire house in the same amount of time as it takes to wrestle with this thing. Save your money and electricity- mopping is not really that hard.
3,Bulky,"I've had my Floor mate for over 4 years. I was thrilled when I first had it. My tank has been leaking this past year, I've considered buying a new solution tank, but may buy a steam mop instead.Pros:1. Squigy action, picks up dirty water2. Scrubs the floorCons:1. Bulky/heavy2. Tank runs out before I finish my kitchen3. Floormate cleaner is expensive, but would work using vinegar and water or another cleaner4. Doesn't get out tough dirt/food marks5. Moves in straight lines, hard to get to corners and small spaces"
2,It works as a mop,"I not going to say that this product doesn't work it does but as a mop, is practical but doesn't clean the grout of tile floors, and thats whay I boought it in the first place, I like to see the grout clean and the only form is with a brush and your own hands. On laminated floors doesn't work either, it cleans but spray the water all around. If you are going to uset as a mop is ok."
5,Received as Advertised,Received the product on time and as advertised. I would do business with them again. I did however have to email Popeil to provide shipping details which were then provided.
1,Floormate,It was defective and had to be returned for a replarment but it was done very easily. A new one was brought and the first one was picked up at the sane time by UPS
4,Hoover H3030,"We rated this machine at 4 stars because we haven't used the dry vac setting yet. We have used this machine three times on all our tile floors, it does an excellent job as far as we are concerned. Some deep stains in the grout still requires manual cleaning but all in all this is a great machine and we would recommend it to others."
3,not satisfied,This is the second time I am using the Spin Scrub. It does not soak upthe water like it should. I still have to use a towel to absorb the water. I had a Hoover scrubber about 20 years ago which did a much better job than this one.
2,so disappointed!,"I have been lusting after a hoover floormate since I moved into a house with linoleum near Seattle. The mud they track in is ridiculous and the dirt is so fine it leaves dust everywhere. I have two children with more on the way, and I hate sweeping and mopping. I finally bought a floormate hoping it would help. ON the first use it 1) barely sucked up anything 2) used the whole bottle of included fluid to clean the floors in two rooms 3) did a horrible job cleaning the paw prints my lab left and 4) took forever to streak dirt across my floors.Save your money and buy a new and better mop."
1,IT JUST DIDN'T WORK,"PUTTING TOGETHER THE HOOVER 3030 WAS EASY, BUT WHEN IT CAME TO THE OPERATION OF THE MACHINE... THAT WAS ANOTHER STORY. EVERYTHING SOUNDED OKAY, BUT IT DID NOT PICK UP THE WATER PROPERLY ( VERY POOR SUCTION ),AS WELL AS THE DIRTY WATER CONTAINER ONLY FILLED UP AN INCH OR SO BEFORE THE MACHINE WHINED TO THROW AWAY THE DIRTY WATER, THIS WAS ONLY AFTER A FEW STROKES. I'VE HAD OTHER HOOVER FLOORMATES, AND DEFINITELY THIS WASSUB-STANDARD AT BEST. I SENT BACK THE UNIT IMMEDIATELY."
4,I really like it!,"Ok, don't expect miracles. I will not clean away years of dirty grout...for that get a toothbrush and get to work. What it will do is keep the grout from getting that dirty! Since it sucks up the dirty water as you go, it won't lay in the grout. I've used mine in my new home and I've NEVER had dirty grout!I use mine about twice a week. It keeps my ceramic tiles spotless....and I have two kids and a dog and new construction(ie, not a lot of grass, just a lot of dirt and mud!)Why didn't I give it five stars? .....For five stars it would have to clean by itself!"
2,This item has a defect,"The product works well except for one manufacturer's defect. There is a float shut off in the waste water collection tank. The float is not heavy enough to due what it is supposed to do, ONLY SHUT THEEVICE OFF WHEN THE COLLECTION TANK BECOMES FULL. Instead, the float is often sucked up without the tank being full resulting in the device shutting itself off very frequently for no reason. If I were you I would consider another unit simply because Hoover has not been helpful at all in providing me with a replacement float that would easily remedy this known fault."
1,Dont' Buy,"After seeing the wonderful results in the commercial, the Hoover H3030 Floormate seemed to be the perfect floor cleaner. But when in the real world, it became quickly apparent that while it does all the things it shows on TV (dry and wet vacuum, spinning brush actions, it just can not handle real dirt and grime on a flat surface floor. At best it was like taking a wet mop over the floor, it gets up the loose dirt, but can not manage even mild dirt buildup. Also the machine quickly became plugged up when running the wet vacuum function, and I found after maybe 5 minutes or less of use, you had to stop and dump the tank, and refill with more cleaner solution. It's just not capable of doing real cleaning, more like a light mopping if anything. Bottom line, don't buy it."
1,Awful floor cleaner,"My parents recommended the floormate to me when I moved into a house with some tile. They have one and they think it works well. We, however, think that it is awful. First, it does not save any time - in fact, it takes more time than mopping. Second, it does a horrible job - the scrubbers don't do much at all. Third, the wheels get dirty, and then when the floor is wet and you go to dry it, the wheels leave streaks of dirt on the floor. Finally, you have to change the water very frequently."
2,Don't Bother,"Pouring, measuring, cleaning out the dirty water and hair, using only the ""right"" cleaner....Too much work for something that doesn't live up to the expectations I had. Does not do a great job scrubbing dirt off the floor, it leaves behind water streak marks, and it does not do a good job of drying up the water. You also have to keep switching it back and forth-there are separate switches to mop, and dry. Works slowly... and boy is it heavy after ahwile, unless of course your goal is to give your arm a good workout! I'm also used to my cordless sweepers, I found having to work around the cord to mop the floors, (and plug it in and then unplug it for each room) used more effort than it's worth. For a hundred and forty dollars I expected much more!"
3,Original Floormate Better,"Plastic components were damaged easily. I received two units with damaged components. It also does not seem to pickup water as well as my original floormate. The float arm needs to be dampened because quick movements cause the float to close, even with no water in the pickup tank.The single selector (dry pickup, scrub, wet pickup)is an improvement over the original"
4,"Better than a Mop, Easy on hands and knees!",The more you use the spinscrub the better the floor looks and feels.
3,Older model was better,This SpinScrub is ok but my older model picked up better. I have to use a mop to finish drying up the floor when I finish cleaning it. I would not have paid the full price for it but it wasn't too bad with the discounts I got from Amazon. I wish you could get around tight areas (behind commodes) with it.
3,Better than manual mopping,"I hate HATE mopping. This helps me do the task BUT it doesn't do the best job on my tile floor. How3ver, I'm keeping the cleaner."
2,Not worth it!,"I bought this hopeing for a miracle to clean my grout. I have a very pale pinkish porcelain tile in my kitchen with very light, almost white grout..(I did not choose this!) It cleaned my floor, but it did not clean the grout. I will have to still get on my hands and knees to scrub the grout. This is going back to the store"
4,It's Ok But Not Good For Hardwood Floors,"It DO NOT SUCK UP THE DIRT. It just Doesn't quite get the dirt of the floor when i use the dry vacuum. No matter how many times i go over the dirted area i doesn't pick it up. And if the dirt is in a corner forget it. Pleeeaaaseee don't even waste your time and just get the dirt up some other way.In regards to the wet vacuum. Its up to you how much water you want to wet the area that you want cleaned by pushing a button at the top. And when your done the feature that is suppose to dry the floor does nothing. The floor stays damp.It's like the only thing the vacuum is good for is the wash feature that I can't even enjoy because of the hardwoord floors I have. It did clean the dust and some dirt off the floor and left the place smelling clean, but also let the floor so damp I regretted using it in the long run.I honestly want to sell it back. I no longer want it. To me it wasn't worth the money I spent on it.EnJoy and Think Twice."
3,hoover 3030 does not honor warranty without reciept,"I have two of these machines. It works great . Only the second one i bought would not release . It was brand new, and i had bought it at a going out of business sale. I had no warranty papers when i bought it. I called the company to let them know the handle would not release. I did not have a reciept and they said it could not be fixed under warranty.I have several hoovers vacums and have never had a problem. I also have one of these at my other house and it works great.But when an item is brand new and the company won't believe that I just bought it and tells me they can't help me. That makes me question if i should continue to do business with a company that doesn't care about their customers."
1,Do not buy this machine!,"I purchased the FloorMate SpinScrub to clean my hardwood floors. The machine itself does an ok job if you are in a hurry. However, the cleaner you are supposed to use with this machine has been discontinued (per customer service at Hoover). They have no cleaner to replace the Old English formula that was designed for use in their machine. If you have hardwood floors do not buy this machine. To make matters worse, when you purchase this machine it includes a sample of the Old English floor cleaner that has been discontinued. They should remove these from the market for false advertising. The FloorMate is only good for floors other than hardwood."
3,"I like the theory, but it isn't any faster","I like the theory of this machine (not cleaning the floor with dirty water), but it is just as time consuming, if not more so, than mopping. Then you have to clean out the machine. I would recommend buying, but don't expect it to be a ""quick clean""."
2,Not so happy,The floor cleaner worked well for awhile and its not particularly easy to use. The vacum doesn't work very well after some repeated use and nor does the water dispenser. I was very happy at first but became less and less as time passed. Even when it was new and out of the box it was very time consumingThis is not a very good product. I like Hoovers products but not this one.
3,Better than a Mop!,"Just thought I would throw my two cents worth in, we live in Florida and we have all ceramic tiled flooring and it was quite a job cleaning the tiles with a mop and bucket so we decided to purchase something that would do the job with a little less effort. It does make the job cleaning the tiles a lot easier definitely! It reduces your work load to about half, there is work involved and a learning curve to get use to of when to apply the cleaner and how long to go over an area.I would give this a thumbs up though and it seems to be a good product.Be prepared to dump the water periodically because it seems to fill up quick. Does not do any magic to grout though, but the cleaning solution for grout does work if you go over and over it!"
1,Disappointed in Hoover,"I recently purchased a Hoover Floormate 500 from Amazon.com. Opened the box, assembled the unit and got ready to scrub. After about 10 minutes, it started to lose suction. Checked all of the connections, filter, etc. Turned it on and it started again. So I called the Hoover customer service phone number and was told to recheck everything I had just checked. Turned the machine on while the representative was on the floor and within seconds, she heard the change in sound and knew it had lost suction again. After a lengthy wait, I was told that they would contact me with a decision on what to do with the unit. She could not say when, however.Brand new unit, fresh out of the box, first time I used it and a wet floor... I am extremely disappointed in Hoover's service and quality control."
2,Broke after 1 year!,"I made the mistake of letting my mother keep my original Floormate. I had it for 4 years and she has had it for the last 2 years - and it is still going strong. I went to buy a new one when I moved across the country, only to find the original having been ""improved"". After 1 year with the 500, the suction completely gave out on me. I had it repaired. 8 months later, the same thing happened again. The quality on this new model is nowhere near what it was on the original. I have come to love the convenience of the Floormate, so I will be trying a different model. Hopefully that one will fare better than this one did."
3,"Great, unfortunately slow.","This is a very nice series that has a very solid story. Found it unlike other ""crime"" dramas. The pacing is slow. Story doesn't drag but doesn't move at decent clip either. The packaging is unfortunately bulky. If you are a fan of English drama's check it out. This series is based off three books. I believe something was lost in the transition from book to film."
3,The shoe pinches and it shows,"It is a theme that is uncomfortable to contemplate, and despite an excellent cast, unconvincing. I don't think any of the actors were at fault. I do think it is very difficult to get that close to knowing or even having genuine understanding of the basis for pyschopathy, and being able to come from that mindset while portraying the lives of fairly ordinary people with generally good intentions with a psychopath in their midst."
2,Creepy and evil soap opera?,"This might be a thrill for certain people in a funk that want to exorcise their gnarly demons. I tried to enjoy this story, but conclude that there is a dark intention underlying the whole thing. It's very negative and Anti-Christianity, or whatever form of religion is being represented by the man in the collar. Hate to say it, but it seems like another brick in the Satanic wall. There are forces at work which aren't plainly visible to the eye. Having turned from a God of love, people are drifting into alot of junk. There is a strange noise throughout much of the program which is very unnerving. It's like a drawn out depressing version of The Omen, although I rate The Omen as a classic horror movie and Fallen Angel as NOT GOOD. There's that noise again!!"
4,A Slim-fast classic!,"Recently I was chatting with a woman who lost over 100 pounds on Slim-fast. She said she owed her success to the Slim-fast dutch chocolate bars. She ate them twice a day as meal replacements accompanied by an 8oz glass of fat free milk, along with other meals. Inspired by her success I decided to try the bars. They are very tasty! Though not as scrumptious as some of Slim-fast's other bars, its a good solid taste of chocolate and with the milk is filling. If you are on the run and want something quick you may want to check out these bars."
2,Go one way or the other,"If you're going to buy a headset for your telephone I recommend paying $10 or $40 but not this middling model. At the low end the AT&T 90800 is cheap and works very well -- the sound quality is good and it is relatively comfortable.However, if you are going to spend time with this, the Plantronics M175 by far worth the additional expense. Much more invisible from the stand point of the user (you completely forget its on your head) and the listener on the other end. I have them both and switch to the Plantronics unit when I know it is going to be a long call or I going to be moving about."
5,"great product, speedy service","I am really excited about my new tool. It works great, seems sturdy, and I am really glad I didn't get a smaller one."
2,Not so good,"I love using equipment recommended by America's Test Kitchen, however, this one failed to live up to their praises!Despite its strainer and somewhat large capacity, the spout is the failure on this gravy strainer. When using a lot of liquid, the design of the spout allows liquid from the strainer area to seep out. Kinda defeats the benefits of straining gravy liquids. Also, to avoid this issue, the strainer must hold less than a cup of liquids"
2,Treadeau 0991105 Gravy/Fat Separator,The Gravy/Fat Separator was not exactly what I thought it would be. This separator did the job of separating but when it comes to pouring the good stuff back into the pan it just mixed it together. Very disappointed in this product.
3,No instructions,I purchased three of the Trudeau Gravy/Fat Separators as gifts. The biggest problem I found was that they did not come with any type of instruction. Just the separators put in a box. One person I gave it to had not even heard of a gravy/separator. Therefore I will give it 3 stars.
5,Could I have another,"After years of ice cubes and waiting, spooning out the fat, and just plain frustration, we bought this. Perfect is not too strong of a word. Great to clean too. You will not be disappointed one bit."
3,its okay,"maybe i should'nt trim off so much fat before i cook the meat . i made my turkey and there wasn't enough fat to separate. also afraid i might break it, kinda light weight plastic."
5,You cannot beat this tool,Very nice design. very good function. Love the strainer part on top. Separator is very good with little fat carryover.
5,Best thing happend in my life.,"I bought this because Chef's Illustrated recommended. It was true. It's the best. Easy to use, simple mechanism, easy cleaning. I highly recommend this."
5,great product,"this really does the trick; it is a nice size (4 cups); I had a smaller one previously, and was constantly doing sauces in batches...I am glad I gave this one a try. I would recommend."
5,Love it!,"Finally got tired of skimming the fat from the top of the sauce/drippings when trying to make gravies. Finally caved in and bought a proper fat separator. After reading on the America's Test Kitchen website that this one was the top recommendation I decided to purchase it. Have not been disappointed with it yet. Was a little worried that I wouldn't be able to properly clean around the spigot area towards the bottom of the separator. Very glad that I bought the larger size, the 2-cup would have been far too small."
5,Excellent concept... well presented,"There are only so many ways to present the same information, but Allyson Lewis seems to have found a new one. The concept of seven minute exercises is GREAT! There are procrastinators and unmotivated people everywhere who can be impacted by this book.Lots of books tell you you should change this or that, but they fail to make the change appealing or even possible. This book proposes that change can happen in little seven minute increments. That concept alone, will change thousands - even millions - of lives.I think this would be a great gift book for any procrastinators or unmotivated people in your life."
5,Deep Dish totally devastates...,"Words are indescribable... buy this cd, pop it in... if you don't feel like dancing, there is seriously something wrong about you. DEEP DISH is dope, period. Wicked (...)"
2,The Future of Music?,"Maybe I am getting too old and I am beginning to grow out of great electronic music. At least that is how I responed after listening to this GU release. After owning every GU release prior to Singapore, I was looking foward to the Deep Dish contribution. Unfortunately, this mix suffers from annoying vocals that never let up. The only reason why I give this release two stars is because disk one seems tolerable when compared to disk two (and because I sometimes must live in denial). I encourage anyone to purchase Jimmy Van M's Bedrock release instead. By the way, maybe GU can sign JVM for GU 22 to atone for this one. Thanks"
3,it's growing on me,"There are four or five cuts that I really wanted, so I bought it. All in all, it's not bad, just a little slow. This disc gives you some vocals, some really good lounge music, and in a couple areas does manage to inspire a feeling, but I was by no means WOWed. The highlight was Dido's ""THANKYOU"" and an awesome version of ""Rapture"". ""Wish you were here"" was a nice addition too. This is a decent disc, just not as good as I'd hoped."
3,Not the duo's best by a longshot......,"After catching the pleasure of seeing Dubfire and Sharam live three years ago in my hometown of Gainesville, FL, I was instantly hooked on the duo known as Deep Dish. Unfortunately, this two-disc compilation, while having its moments, just doesn't do for me what their other albums and their live sets do, and that's getting me into a continuous, uninterupted desire to dance.Disc 1 starts off well with 16B's ""Escape"" and progressively moves through some sleak and sexy beats. However, it seems that the mix runs out of steam once Chus and Ceballos' ""Strong Rhythms"" fades out and makes way for Deep Dish's remix of Dido's ""Thank You."" From there, the beat takes a lethargic and uninspired turn that practically all but kills the mood that it sought to build in the beginning.Disc 2 doesn't fare much better, as it too has its mood shaking rough edges. All in all, the album is decent at best, but miles away from flawless."
5,Deserving of Underground,"Released in 2001, I still dig the layer upon layer Deep Dish serves you. Methaphorically illustrating, its like a smooth frozen drink turned into a car crash (potent-easy-sipping local drink) and ends with you being sent home in an ambulance. GLOBAL UNDERGROUND 021 from Moscow hits the chord of what its like to be UNDERGROUND."
2,Hmm...,"I was expecting something different, to tell you the truth. I disagree with the person who said this CD was ""Tenaglia-like"" , because if you compare this to Tenaglia in Athens (Global Undergrouns as well), or Tenaglia's Back to Basics, you find dramatic differences. I was a little disappointed with this GU compilation as I have come to expect new and unheard music. house. This even has a remix of Dido on it! It's a strange kind of ""house music"" if you can even call it that. My opinion is that it's cheesy mainstream electronica that is uncharacteristic of Deep Dish. Overall rating: Wait for their next compilation or go to a show in Washington D.C. This isn't their best work."
4,"Great location, great dj's, great vibes","it was a great party! it was a great ambience! i believe it's the best complation of deep dish ever released. warming you up, drifting you away, taking you to the highest point and BOOM!!!"
5,The best of the Best,It doesn't get any better than this. They have made a breakthrough in early 00s. Nowadays they do not make music together but this is one of those legendary albums out there. Pure progressive house... Every single song is better than the other one. It's amazing how these two guys compiled and mixed at this mix together. I am working to collect all the GU series. It's essential all the way. The quality find it's roots. It doesn't get any better than that...
3,Its good but that about it,"The only reason I got this CD was because it was recorded in Moscow, my home town. The double Cd has a few tracks that I enjoyed but for the most part it was a very blah CD for me. I have seen Deep Dish live and enjoyed their music, but this Cd just didn't do it for me."
2,Disappointing,Just didn't click...too many anthems and laborious tracks. Not so much with Rapture and Dido. Needs more of the vibe reached in tracks 3-4 in CD1. Overall uninspiring and way too ordinary. This was their best chance too...
2,this is not the future,"If GU wants to stay relevant, they'll have to do better than this. Despite many good individual tracks, this doesn't have the feeling of going on a real journey like Ibiza or Los Angelas. It also suffers from a somewhat ""dancey"" feel. GU needs another classic ASAP. In fact, it needs three. My eyes look to Sasha . . ."
4,music to listen to as well as dance,I am up to my third copy of this c.d and am wishing I could find a flawless disc in amongst the 6.The music is superb but the Singaporean pressing are appalling.
3,Try other Deep Dish CDs,"I am a fan of Deep Dish, but Global Underground 21- Moscow is not thier best album. This album has some good tracks, but overall its not as good as Yoshiesque 1, 2, or Renaissance Ibiza. Great live DJ sets, but this album if a bit of the mark."
5,One of the BEST from the GU series,"I am a big Deep Dish fan and have been ever since they began. I am also a big fan of the GU series and I have all the collection but must say that DEEP DISH GU021:Moscow is definitely one of my favourites. Its one of those compilations that will never sound old and you can always listen to. All the mixes on this compilation are brilliant but those that deserve to be mentioned are ""Rapture"" by iio, PMT's ""Deeper Water"" and definitely Dido's ""Thank You"". Deep Dish moved very swiftly to cover the disappointment of their other 2001 release ""Yoshiesque Vol 2"", which although contains a few highlights, still fails to impress. BUT this one is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
4,GU is coming back to itself !,"I must say that deep dish has done it agin, after their Yoshi' 2 which was superb comes this GU set - Fantastic (forget the disappointing GU 020) expect to hear more deep/tribal than groove which is refreshing.CD 1 opens with ""escape"" an amazing track full of depth and emotion,""Rise"" has a wonderfull deep in the sea scape , ""Waiting"" is a soft tribal pumper with great sounds. all in all CD1 is more for listining plesure.CD2 has more beat driven tracks such as ""Shame"" which reminds me the sound of way out west's ""The Fall"" - complex yet easy on the ear, ""Comin down"" with excellent rythem & Fx, the superb ""Sunset"" remix that starts from scrach and the ""I wish you were here"" remix that goes smoooooooooth. overall you can dance more to CD2.Deep Dish simply has good taste..."
3,Smelly....,"Functionally, the bands are pretty good I guess, but even just working with them for 10 minutes left me with a strong smell of rubber on my hands for the better part of the rest of the day. It was enough of an odor to make me not want to use them again."
3,Meh,I definitely remember Mike Birbiglia being funnier. This whole performance was only worth a few chuckles. Not terrible but not his best.
4,So understated and funny,The guy talks at one speed.. mellow.. and he is insight fully funny! I understand why he is an NPR star.
5,Mike is hilarious,"Great show. It is time for a new one, but this is still a great show. His stories from his life and the delivery are priceless. I really enjoy Mike's humor."
5,Mike Bahooski- King of Comedy,"Just a quick word for all of the ""pudgy and awkward"" haters out there. This. Is. Comedy. Gold. Don't think about it. Don't worry about it. Just hit the ""order this now"" button and get this pronto. Guaranteed to put a smile on your face."
2,Not so funny,I was so excited to see this and it was a let down - we both fell asleep. There were funny parts here and there and far between.
5,I love Birbigs,"Mike Birbiglia is hilarious. His comedy is spot-on, I love the DVD and all the extras. He is quotable, too! I apologize for having nothing to say, but without any criticism, my notes are brief."
4,Transformed,"This is the first time I have ever written a review. However, as I tend to rely on them rather heavily when making selections it seemed an apt time to start,if only to rebuff the haughty ""what a dog"" review. I discovered Bianca at the public library and enjoyed it thoroughly, and have subsequently purchased a copy for my personal library. The story was both entertaining and informative. I believe Mr. Elegants researched well and painted an accurate and vivid picture that kept me turning pages until the wee hours."
4,An author's astronished protest,"I am the author of 'Bianca"", which has received generally favorable review in the the trade press. I am somewhat surprised at the `lack of courage of a 'reader in San Diego,' who writes a vitriolic review, but has not the courage to allow his/her name to appear. On the other hand, the general illiteracy of the letter and the banality of the thought processes are rassuring. He/she obviously does not have either the intelligence or the education to appreciate even a popular novel."
4,interesting.,The most interesting part of this book is that it was written over a decade ago and many of the macro-econ. parts referred to have come to be. I agreed with some but not all of his ideas. I will say for the reader that enjoys predictions this is a very good read if one is looking at that angle.
2,Nothing new,"Same as last reviewer--thought this was going to be a new Set 4, but these two (Road Rage and Simosola) have been out for years. I bought them several years ago as a set. Very sneaky--I too almost ordered this before checking out what stories it contained. Be careful."
2,Made for telelvision,"It is more than annoying that these otherwise fine productions are chopped up -- apparently suited for the insertion of commericials. They must originally have run in segments -- why else would you have credits in the middle AND at the end?Sometimes,I had to fish around to find the proper orderI would not buy another one."
4,Good start for the new Chiropractor,"Being a New Chiropractor, looking to bypass the downward fall of the managed care system, I was pleased with the information obtained from this reader friendly guide. It gave me a starting point in which to research further into all aspects of beginning a cash practice from scratch. The authors are even available for further assistance and have directed me to cash practices in my area to contact. They've been of great help. I recommend this book to all new Chiropractors looking to venture into private practice."
2,It's mediocre,"There are other books better than this. I'd say it's worth buying if it was the only publication of it's kind. Fortunately, other titles of this kind are much better and informative. They cover broader area.This book is just story of how one chiropractor runs his office. It's kinda like listening to a teacher from chiropractic school how he did this and that. Of course, anyone who needs this kind of help knows that they are no help. This book is outdated and some of the things (some critical things) don't apply in today's standard.So shop around.."
3,DARWIN?!!!!!!!!!,"TAKE DARWIN OUT AND PUT LEONARDO DA VINCI IN! THE 'THEORY' OF EVOLUTION,(NOTHING BUT HIGHLY IMAGINED SUPPOSITIONS, WITH ABSOLUTELY NO CONCLUSIVE OR FACTUAL PROOF TO SUPPORT IT), IS A THEORY WHEN IT COMES TO THE EVOLUTION OF MANKIND ESPECIALLY. WHAT THE HELL IS DARWIN BEING PUT IN THE SAME LEAGUE AS THESE OTHER GENTLEMEN, ESPECIALLY SIR ISAAC NEWTON!? SCIENCE WOULD NEVER HAVE HAD THE BEDROCK, AND I DO MEAN ''BEDROCK', IF IT HADN'T BEEN NEWTON'S FORMULATION FOR GRAVITY 650 YEARS AGO. LEONARDO DA VINCI WAS QUITE FRANKLY, A 'TRUE GENIUS' IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD. 1,000 YEARS AHEAD OF HIS TIME.HE PROBABLY BELONGS HERE BEFORE EINSTEIN! PLEEEAAAASSSSEEEE. GIVE ME A BREAK! THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A FULL 5 STARS IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR DARWIN. HEY NOVA YOU REALLY MADE A MONKEY OUTTA YOURSELVES FOR THIS!"
3,Informative but a bit slow.,There is loads of valuable info but the temptation to nod off is pretty high.
4,Works well for my needs,"I bought these to not disturb others and be able to watch tv at a volume I enjoy late into the evening because where I live you can hear through the walls easily. I was frustrated and disappointed at first as I did not realize an adapter was REQUIRED on the cord for the base unit to work with MY television, after purchasing the adapter cord at radioshack the unit worked fine and I use them on a regular basis, I like the fact that I can leave the front room and walk through the house and still hear the program while in another room. These work well for me, I am pleased with the performance and GLAD I purchased them."
3,SO SO headphones,"I like the headphones in general but as others have stated, there is a slight hiss when you are in between songs. That hiss is not present when I used wired headphones. Once the music is playing, they sound great. Also, when I got mine(the reconditioned ones) there was an adapter that was left out of the box. A decent purchase for the price overall though."
1,Annoying pop every minute,"These headphones were great, for the first minute, then they started to pop. Every minute the power saving feature checks to see if the headphones is receiving anything, while it does this it causes the headphones to pop and disrupts sound. Very annoying. Did i mention it happens every single minute. Sorry guys, this is a major flaw and I don't recommend it, mine will be going back to the seller. To bad too because my husband was really excited about them."
2,Noisy background,"Very comfortable to wear, but way too much background hiss. Hard to keep them working. I returned mine. Also, the battery compartment is very difficult to access."
2,Fussy device,"I found the static on these to be too much. Depending on where I stood in a room, it could be almost inaudible, but would be overwhelming with walking around. I had to go back to the emitter console often to switch the channels. They're comfortable, and less expensive than several other options, so if they work for you, then it's a great deal.I sent mine back as they had a faulty power adapter, so maybe a different set would work better."
5,Awesome!,All I can say is that these are just great! They are well worth the money. I got them because my husband likes to play the XBox while I am doing school work. The sound is so clear and crisp!
