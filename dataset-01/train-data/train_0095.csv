2,So tedious that I can't continue it,"I've not had any of the technical problems that others seem to be complaining about. Yes, the scenery is beautiful but the gameplay is TEDIOUS. No thrill or awe here. I was well over the breathtaking scenery by the time I solved the first puzzle. Frustrated and bored is the best way I can describe how I felt. My 2 other family members agree and don't want to continue with it either. The positive 5 star reviews that I've read here sound pretty fake. Someone please shoot me if I have to suffer through any more of this game."
1,the gaming equivalent of Rocky 5,"This is the gaming equivalent of Rocky 5...it shouldn't have happened. Just pretend it's a bunch of outakes, and ignore it from the series.I must say, I blame ubisoft. I was selected as a beta tester for this game, and while i understand that there are many issues to attended to, all the bugs that I reported are still present in this game, and to me, that's far beyond unacceptable.To all the people having trouble getting the game to launch: know that you are not alone, and it's likely not you.I can't believe that Rand and Ryan Miller endorse the work that Ubisoft has done. I have been a big fan of Myst and the D'ni history for a long time, and this game does no justice to it at all. It is more than pretty pictures...I get that point, and it seemed at one time that the Miller brothers were bent on expressing that point. I'm hoping that Cyan will take it back and try to recover from the damage that's been done."
2,This is not an improvement!,"The little action figure that you create is irritaing to move. I never did get the hang of it and spent lots of time spinning around and bumping into things. The game itself seems to have a marketing strategy geared toward the online game. I found the problems difficult, actually impossible, to solve. Much frustration here. Lots of side tracks that have nothing to do with solveing the game puzzles which lead to hours of boredom and frustration. Much better to play previous games of Riven and Exile. Even the original Myst has a charm and satisfaction that this game lacks."
1,Uru,"If I could have given this game 'ZERO' stars I would have. A big, big disappointment. And I can't return it because it has been opened. Do not buy this game!"
1,Pathetic,"I have enjoyed all of the previous Myst titles but this game will not run on either of my new (less than a year old) computers - these are top brands, too. I know there are several other reviews like this and I just want to emphasize DO NOT buy this game unless you have the specific video card requirements listed. Only 2 brands will work and they have to be the specific model listed."
1,"If you don't have broadband, don't bother","Ubi gives this little nugget of information buried deep within their website, perhaps hoping people will buy it before noticing: you have to have broadband to play the Uru live online portion. I cannot find anywhere on the Amazon listing that gives potential buyers this info."
1,Have to agree with most other reviewers,"This company expects everyone to spend 40-50 bucks on this game and then also expects them to have the most recent hardware or upgrade their hardware. Then they will wonder why they didn't sell more.The program just crashes, if the card wasn't compatible why couldn't the install program determine that and save a few hours of my precious time.Thanks for nothing UbiSoft!"
2,I want that old thing back,"Of course I watched this season anxiously, but it just didn't hit the spot like it usually does. Maybe I was skeptical from the beginning since I figured you can't get any bigger or worse than the devil. Although entertaining, it was all over the place. fairies? dragons? then they had this mother of all issue last maybe 1 1/2 episodes then it was gone!Also the chemistry seemed a little strained between Dean and Sam which I thought was hilariously pointed out in The French Mistake episode. All in all it was like Chinese food, I was hungry again in an hour for something more fulfilling."
3,Sad to say I'm disappointed,"Being a huge fan of Supernatural, I was really expecting a lot from season 6. But honestly, it was somewhat of a let down. Yeah, Kripke stepped down and his 5 season story arc ended, but I still thought that the writers would be able to come up with a more interesting--or at least consistent--story line. Besides some very good episodes towards the second half of the season, the season as whole was sporadic and repetitive. Some characters and items that were introduced as important just faded into the background or were just easily dealt with. Other than that and the sudden twist near the end, it was typical Sam/Dean mistrust and complications all weaved under the general theme of ""souls."" Nonetheless, I am looking forward to season 7 and hope that some of the old scary Supernatural feel returns instead of continuing on with this drama-filled and mundane trek it's gone on."
2,Disappointing,"My son and I were both really disappointed in the new seasons 1st episode. It lack so much including a decent plot line. We expected a more exciting story - since Sam and Grandpa are fresh from heaven and hell plus not a whole lot about the cousins. Why the gin creatures? There could have been other creatures that would have made a better story like demons, the trickster, ghosts...these are all creatures they have done multiple episodes on - but the gin - 1 episode and it wasn't focused on the creatures. This just seemed to be the type of episode you would see mid season - not one to start to season off with. It was just flat. What happened - new writers???? We hope the other episodes have some umpf to them...btw, it was neat seeing Corin Nemic, glad to know he has a paying gig and isnt doing those silly internet shows with David Faustino anymore :)"
1,I'm sure the episode is GREAT but AMAZON screwed it up!,"I'm extremely salty that I purchased the episode but could not stream it due to a poor internet connection. Instead, I downloaded Amazon Unbox Video and then downloaded my purchased item. WELL, guess what...It took hours to download and THEN I go to play it AND IT WAS ONLY AUDIO, NO VISUAL! Ahhhhhhhhhhhh, whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy Amazon, whyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?I am extremely displeased."
5,Great series,"Love the story lines and the Winchesters aren't bad to look at either! A mix of sci-fi, drama, and comedy."
5,supernatural,"Really love the supernatural series, and the excellent customer service from Amazon. It is a great series to watch if you like the ""supernatural"""
5,Love those Winchester boys!!,again the boys have not let us down! The writing on this show is just mind blowing. I cannot believe they have not been recognized for any of the show's talents. The characters good and bad just keep getting more interesting and hook you in at every episode. I always wonder how they will out do themselves each week and sure enough they manage to pull another unique and interesting episode. I enjoy the re-occurring characters dead and alive. The ending will blow you away and an amazing lead in to their 7th season! I have shared this amazing series with a bunch of my friends and now they have all become regular viewers past and present episodes. I am waiting for Mr. Krippe to get his due recognition for an awesome idea and making it pure entertainment! Jensen and Jared are fun to watch and it helps they have such great chemistry together. They are the best looking demon chasers on TV. Rock on!
5,New and better Supernatural,"The season opener is wonderful. It presents a completely new foundation for the series.1. Revised and upgraded characters with convincing new backstory;2. better defined and more convincing personality for Sam and Dean and Bobby and new characters;3. less like a comic book, strong, confident script writing;4. well-conceived and realized villains;5. Subtle and convincing special effects;6. dialogue, story line, etc., less contrived and believable;7. lingering undercurrent of uncertainty and suspense about who Dean can trust, about what is really going on, the sense that there is a lot that you need to know but don't know yet;8. more believable, better grounded in ""real world"";9. like a whole new series, starting from scratch - a complete reboot;10. story draws you right in;11. less wild and unbelievable plot line;12. episode 1 satisfying in itself and leaves you looking forward eagerly to the new season;Do not hesitate. Buy episode one and enjoy."
3,Pretty lame,Season 6 is pretty lame. Just love this show but was really disappointed in this season. Maybe 2 or 3 good shows.
3,so so season at best,"The season was very sub par compared with the rest of the show. This is by far my favorite show left on tv but season six was a disappointment. However, it needs to b watched to continue on with the show."
5,Just when you think it could get no better.....IT DOES!,"Where to begin?? Well, I was a bit nervous of where S6 would go after S5....I mean REALLY how DO you top the Apocalypse and battle with Lucifer?? You don't. That is what made S6 soooo perfect really. It went back to its roots (just as Eric Kripke SAID the writers were going to do and do very well). More monster of the weekish premise with a story arc to link it all up. I thought the acting, writing, humor....ALL of it was spot on. I could tell the writers ""got"" this series and stayed true to it. I can't wait for S7!"
3,OMG.,This season was really well. Definitily cant wait for season 7. The ending had me shocked i wasnt expecting the whole thing with lisa and ben what so ever. I hope season 7 comes back better then ever. I liked Cas in all the other seasons but this one i just down right hated him. I hope things get better for sam but we all know before they get better they get worse. So i guess we will see.
3,questionable cass,"SPOILER ALERT!!!!(if u haven't already seen it) Cass quickly found his way into my heart in the 5th season and has been there ever since, but the fact that his intentions and motives are extremely questionable in this episode discourages me. I love all the supernatural episodes, regardless of how off they may seem to some, but Cass possibly being the bad guy struck a nerve. I hope he gets his act together before the Winchesters take him out."
4,Still worth watching,"When ""Supernatural"" began it was a good show. In season two it became a great show with exciting stories and good, believable interactions between the main characters.The series continued at this high level for several years.After the producers introduced the apocalypse storyline the show lost its way, but there are still some wonderful episodes in season six, particularly for long time fans of the series.People new to the show are likely to miss many of the In-jokes so prevalent in season six, but it is still possible to get considerable entertainment out of it."
4,Fun In Hell,"The sixth season and the show hasn't lost any of it's steam. Funny, scary and >ahem< family friendly....sort of. The show's still NOT for everybody, but if you have a sense of humor and a need for escape from reality TV, this is a good bet."
2,Ruined the Entire Series,"I was and always will be a huge fan of Supernatural seasons one through five. The deep and meaningful tone about family grouped with hilarious humor and some scary story telling made for one of the best television shows I had ever seen, and probably ever will. But when this season debuted after the entire plot was summed up in the fifth installment, it felt as though the writers were reaching. I will admit that there were some enjoyable episodes in this season, as there will always be when watching Supernatural (no matter how bad the complete season is). To me, being the huge fan of this series that I was, it really disappointed me when Kripke left and everything went a little crazy. All in all, I would have preferred them to end the show on season five."
5,supernatural,It is much different from other shows of this nature and keeps me interested into the next season. I always look forward to watching.
5,Most awesome show ever!,"Love this show. Been waiting all year for it to come out on dvd. Like the story line, and the back and forth of the winchester brothers' relationship. It's not always clear who is the moral compass, but their support for each other keeps them moving forward. I could go on and on, but I won't. I really enjoy this series, good entertainment and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the paranormal or the ""boogeyman""."
4,Love it!!!!,Just love Sam and Dean!!!!I can not wait for Season 7. Season 6 is GREAT edge of your toes fun!
5,Great!,"Got here earlier than I expected, and the product is amazing! No disappointments here! Consider me a satisfied customer, yup!"
5,Dean Wakes Up,It was obvious they couldn't pursue this storyline long. If you pin down Dean he can't be a hunter and protect anyone---including himself. This compromise they found was the best one possible for the characters. Now onto the hunting. Yeah.
5,Great Plot Writing,"This is the best TV show ever! This season 6 has great writing and acting. Each episode plot is interesting and creative as is the overarching plot; it is really well assembled. Jensen Ackles, as ""Dean"", is funny and sweet. Jared is convincing as a soulless monster killer. This show holds my interest, and wow, it's TV!"
5,"Excellent season, but expect a story warm-up","Supernatural is a great series in general - one of the best written shows on TV.That being said, I'm pretty sure the original intention of the show was to end at the finale of season 5. They'd decided to continue the story on, and this is why I think this season takes a few more episode than normal to bring you in.I will say most of my friends who were fans had some issue staying with the series through this build-up (even I started having a doubt or two) but when you see where the story is going and the truths behind what's going on come out, you'll be glad you stuck with it. The slow build had everything to do with a big story payoff and nothing to do with poor writing or plotting."
5,a great season!,This was a great season!The plots were interesting and the end was not predictable. Cas was a big surprise at the end. I won't give it away. it is a season well worth watching.
4,Rockin!,Have loved the series for many years and it keeps getting better! I only wish they'd bring back the music.
4,Great Series,"Love the Supernatural series and this is no different, i just wish it didnt take so long for Amazon to post things to you"
5,best show EVER!!!!!,"This is the best show ever...I bought as a gift for my best friend and she said she loved it, then I watched and i was hooked on the first episode...Now me and my boyfriend watch it...I on the third season and everytime i watch an episode it keeps getting better and better... Great show."
5,7 Shots of Fun,"Just when you think you're out of laughs, Sam Colt delivers one more. From the moment Dean says he wants to Star Trek 4 this dude, the fun starts and doesn't stop until he ""ganks"" him. Jensen shows that he's got some great comedic timing, Sam gets that frame on a horse (don't you wish Dan Blocker's horse was still around?) and Bobby undergoes a soulonoscopy. More fun than the airplane episode which is still one of my favorites."
5,SUPERNATURAL--EXCELLENT,"First time I saw the show, I was hooked.It has everything I love in this type of series.My favorite show.Hope it never ends."
5,Super episode,"The credits in the begining are completely missed because you are too busy watching Sam work out! I don't like his personality with no soul, but it's fun to see him have a little control over Dean and the fact Dean notices it."
3,"Great Series, Decent Season","I have been a fan of supernatural since it began and have really enjoyed the show up to this point. I was really excited for this season in the wake of the apocolypse and writing changes etc. However as the season started and went on I have to admit I was a little dissapointed. The whole purgatory and Eve story angle was intersting, but felt rushed and came off a little boring at times. Like others I will say towards the end of the season it did become a little more interesting and I am a interested to see how castiel's new role as a god will be developed. Overall this was a decent season, but pales in comparison to previous ones. So with few worthwhile episode I would recommend skipping this unless you just have to have it for the collection"
5,The Perfect Escape,"Thanks to the review of C. Carey Astrakhan, I decided to send for HOW TO TRAVEL INCOGNITO when I was looking for a way to lighten up life after the agonies of Sept. 11th. For me this book had just the right combination of elegant wit and breezy charm. It was refreshing to return to the calmness of 1950's Europe and to roam the world in a Rolls Royce, visiting castles, costume balls, casinos, and the tonier restaurants. The author, who wrote the MADELINE books for children, spent his early years working in a Ritz-Carlton Hotel and knew firsthand the ways of the aristocrats and spoiled rich. He saw their flaws, enjoyed their company, and commented on them with gentle astringency. One character tells another, for instance, that a wealthy woman had a cigarette case made specially for him so that she could have the pleasure of dictating to a jeweller. Ah, yes."
3,Too Political,"For the most part, this is a pretty good album. Where it falls short is in the message. This is my first Trans Am album, so I think I need to dig a bit deeper. I like their choice of arrangements and their use of textures."
3,More consistent than their previous efforts,"These guys are on to something, and Liberation is there most consistent effort yet, political propaganda aside. Until now, Trans Am's albums have been spotty with 50-70% of the content being great and the rest, filler and experimentation with sound textures and colors. Don't get me wrong, I have never regretted any Trans Am purchase, but I have found that making my own collection of certain tunes from various albums provides a more satisfying listen then letting the record spin from start to finish. Liberation is an exception. With less ""experimentation"" and more song writing, these musicians are maturing well in their craft. Plus, I really like Sebastian Thompson drumming."
2,This time the jokes on us,"I've been listening to Trans Am for awhile and I find this latest effort dissapointing. It sounds like a bunch of B-sides or outtakes sprinkled with some ""to cleaver"" political jabs. EBN was doing this 12 years ago (in the other Bush regeime) and more effectivly. I understand TA's modis operandi but this time the joke is to obvious. It's time we all learned the difference between being ""cleaver"" and being ""intelligent""."
2,"Long, repetetive and incomplete","This book could have perfect at 100 pages. Instead the book goes on and on about how bad, delusional, self-centered and lying Larry Ellison is. It also belabores how decadent and immoral are Oracle's marketing and sales people.The book does not really paint a picture of how Oracle became successful. The time line is blurred, instead, we get repetetive stories ripped out of different periods in Oracle's history.The explanations of database industry and technology sector overall are weak.Perhaps if the book was shorter, I would not be as negative, but as it stands at 350 pages, I can not recommend it."
4,Read this book and you'll realize how many Larrys there are!,"This book has repercussions beyond the Rise-and-Fall-and-Rise story of Oracle. The portrait of Ellison rings especially true for those of us who work in high-tech: reading it, I realized how many other, albeit less successful, Larry Ellisons are out there. A fascinating account of the Machiavellian mind at work, this book should be required reading for everyone on his/her way up the corporate ladder."
4,Beautiful view of Larry Elison and why he is the bad boy!,"While Larry proclaims himself a ""VISIONARY"", I found this book to neaty describe how a self made man determined to climb his way up to the top by 30% software and 70% lies and decit. However, upon finishing the book I found myself putting Larry Elison in my ""hero's"" list of what to be and not to be if I ever became a CEO of a high tech company. A fast pace and fun book. Highly recommended."
5,Objectively direct considering the subject,"Mr. Wilson's biography of Larry Ellison (and Oracle) is truthful, direct, and sufficiently detailed to give a clear picture of not only the life and times of Mr. Ellison but also provides an enlighting overview of the nature of start-up to major corporation and the trials and travails of achieving success. In describing Larry Ellison, the word ""unembarassable"" is used and is apparently precise. Therefore, bravo to Mr. Ellison for the courage to bear all his achievements and life lessons to the world. Bravo to Mr. Wilson for remaining honest to the purpose of the story given the presumably formidable character Mr. Ellison seems capable of."
5,"Sure, Bill Gates is richer, but I'd rather be Larry Ellison!","This book was a great read, and it was a blast reading about the great Larry Ellison. Larry Ellison's personality comes out in this book. He is a fun, flamboyant, in-your-face billionaire who knows how to enjoy the money he makes. Big houses, sharp clothes, fast cars, and hot women! Oh, yeah, he also built up a pretty good business.Larry, you're the man!!"
4,There is something to everybody...,"If you like to read about inside the companies stories or biography of theVIP or best of all, pure gossip, you would love the book!A great pleasure to read about Oracle's History."
3,Interesting reading,"It's a very good book in terms of the history of the computing giants that shaped the world. It kept my attention long enough to dedicate 2 days to reading it cover to cover. As an Oracle programmer, it helped me understand some of the thoughts I had of the company since working with their product since the early 90's.The author tried the address the book as a novel, skipping around in time and making it difficult to follow. You go from 1977 to 1989 to 1991 to 1984 to 1996 to ... (you get what I mean). Confusing.This is the type of book that needed to be more linear in timeline or overlapping in timeline, but not arranged the way it was. Still, very enjoyable and worth the read for those that enjoy the behind the scenes action that shaped technology as we know it today."
4,I would recommend it.,"Mike Wilson writes a fairly entertaining tale about Larry Ellison. Being in the software industry, I was humored by many of his antics. I would recommend this book."
1,A poorly written account,"This sorry excuse for a book exhibited some of the worst writing I have come across in recent times. If you want some good reading, check out the New New Thing by Michael Lewis. I couldn't even finish this book... I read about a hundred pages then had to quit for fear of death by boredom. Please, save yourself the money and time, and encourage this ""author"" to go back to his local newspaper."
2,Manhwa nothin'.,"I got this book because I draw manga but decided that I wanted to do something a little different. The first few pages were great! They clearly showed the differences between manga and manhwa. Then he gives you a lot of pages for you to copy the drawings on and practice. Great idea! Except that its virtually all manga/anime stlye. It seemed just like some of the author's other how to draw manga books. I got this book because I DID NOT want a manga book but that's exactly what it turned out to be. If you're interested in drawing MANGA, this book is actually not too bad."
2,"A book of pictures, nothing to learn.","I love Chritopher Hart's books but this one was just didn't cut it. It offered some interesting drawings and differences between anime and manhwa but REALLY, there are just some stylistic changes that any artist can do themselves. You don't need this book, really."
1,Needs More Work,"This book is missing a lot of the stuff that the lab is asking for. The qualification of the authors are questionable. One of them is not even CCIE. This book is TOO overpriced, comparing other CCIE reference books out there. This is vol. 1, I can't imagine anyone would be willing to spend another $100 on vol. 2. Personally, I rather buy other Cisco Press books.Good luck on your CCIE!Joe, CCIE#3xxx (For privacy!)"
2,Noth worth the money,"This book is way over-priced for the level of information it offers. Just from browsing through the lab scenarios, I've seen plenty of typos, errors, and misconfigurations. And worse the scenarios are so basic, it makes you wonder how they can get it wrong. As a CCIE, I don't think these simple labs will help at all for the real exam. If these guys would have concentrated on the book instead if writting about themselves and congratulating one another, this book would have been much better."
1,Bought this before it was avail here,"I've bought a subscription to the authors web site some time back and bought this book based on all the hard selling he was doing on his web site.He cliams that it was a completed materials for preparing for CCIE. It's not, having taken the CCNA and CCNP, it doesn't even come close for this exams either.Worse, all the questions are taken from his web site, so if you subscribe and you bought the book, you are basically paying OVERPRICE TWICE for the same thing in different package !Lots of errors in the software. I never got around to the book because frankly the questions doesn't come close .I would have put ZERO star if it's possible"
1,don't be fooled by the name !,"After passing the CCIE Written Exam last week, I re-read this book and found that it was not worth to pay such money for it.Most of topics related to CCIE exam are not covered in this book (check the blueprint of ccie R/S on cisco web site ). Although the tilte of the book is "" ... CCIE."" , like many ""ccie"" books on the market now, it has less thing to do with the real CCIE level !Publisher should be careful about the what this kind of books talk about and don't mislead readers !Don't get fooled !"
1,Lousy book,"I was expecting a book of good materials but I got a overprice book of questions. Having flunking twice, I feel the questions are nothing of sort of the CCIE written test.Felt cheated"
1,Not a study guide,"This book is not a study guide; it is a sample test. The included software leaves much to be desired - video refresh bugs and ""scrambles"" the answers, interesting when one of the answers is ""A and B""For my money, I would rather go with a book that tells me something, rather than just a bunch of practice questions."
1,"So far, this book is the worst!","I read few chapters of this book, and felt cheated thus far. I agree with others on this list, you could have gotten better material(s) under $99. I would suggest you to go to the bookstore and read some chapters and see if this fits your personal reference.Sam"
3,It's okay.,"It's an okay glue stick. The size is perfect for my mini glue gun and it melts fast and dries fast too. However, it peels off really easily. But that happens with most hot melt glue sticks so... I guess I'll give this an average rating."
3,Not what it looks like...,"We needed replacement glue sticks so bought these ... but it turned out that these glue sticks are TINY, they are not at all the size we needed/expected. They're almost ""toy"" glue sticks. Their diameter is maybe 2/3 the diameter of a pencil, *not* approx 1/2-inch diameter that our glue guns normally use. I suppose we MIGHT be able to jam 2 or 3 of these into the input of a glue gun, but I haven't tried that yet. I've never even seen a glue gun that these would ""natively"" fit in...So, ""caveat emptor"" -- if you want TINY glue sticks, these are what you want. If you want normal, full-size glue sticks, look elsewhere. (I wish I had read this review before I had ordered!)"
3,Mini means smaller,"Never heard of ""mini"" glue guns until now. Would be nice if they put ""mini"" in the title and added a description that the sticks fit a mini gluegun.These sticks are smaller in diameter than sticks for my glue gun. Good thing I found my missing glue sticks right after I ordered these.Oh well, for $4, not worth sending back."
4,"Works, but not the best","It sticks, it dries fast, what more is there to say? Lol. Fits in my mini glue gun perfectly. I have used better glue sticks before though, so they're definitely not the best. They do their job more than well enough nonetheless. Easy to peel off too when dry, but that's to be expected of glue gun sticks."
4,Great character study,"I highly enjoyed this movie...enough to fork over $40 for a copy of it. It takes multiple viewings to understand the complex characters (and to interpret the heavy british accents). Bold filmmaking, very stimulating. There is a lot of dialogue..this is not a plot-driven film, it is more of a character study. It's not a ""happy movie""...some accuse it of misogynist overtones...some may describe it as nihlistic (I do not). I describe it as thought-provoking and unique. Hopefully you can find a copy of it cheaper than $40 however. I do not think the extras warrant the excessive price of the movie, and I only paid it due to the fact no rental store in my area carried it."
3,Depends what you're after...,"This is certainly a well-directed film with excellent performances, I understand the reason for the awards in those categories. If you appreciate the art of film-making, this would be a good choice. However, the story is non-existent - I prefer more closure in this type of intellectual effort, even if I disagree. It's basically the wanderings of a young, critical, pseudo-intellectual with a quick tongue who can quickly disrupt the beliefs and self-perception of the characters he encounters on the streets, but he cannot provide any conclusions of his own. Modern art seems to have spiraled downward so that a single perception, thought, or emotion is enough upon which to build an entire film or play. In this case, it has to do with the passage of time and how the different personalities prepare for or ignore it."
5,The Truth is hard to face...,"Having been a fan of Mike Leigh's approach to filmaking for many years, I admit that Naked is the best of the lot. It's actually a classic story in the ""Everyman"" tradition. Thewlis' performance breaks all the boundaries of contemporary acting and makes us feel almost as if we were watching a docudrama - rather than a work of fiction. And although some viewers may criticize the film's ""lack of plot"", Thewlis' Johnny is indeed fulfilling the journey of human experience. Full-fleshed humanity experiencing all that this life offers. While, at the same time, reflecting upon life in a fruitless attempt to find meaning to why we are here. It's a difficult film, but then so is life to those of us who do not distract ourselves with escapist pursuits. The film teaches us that a life well lived is a painful one. This is what we learn in ""Everyman"" and it's what we learn in Naked. Bravo, Mr. Leigh!"
1,The Worst Movie I've ever seen!,"By the third violent rape sequence in this film, you kind of get the idea that the protagonist is a misogynist and psychopath and ththat the women in the movie are just waiting for him to walk all over them. It really is just disgusting! Now Mike Leigh has made some decent movies, a couple are quite enjoyable to watch. But NAKED is just TRASH, with no redeeming artistic merits. Naked, in fact, surpasses LOST IN SPACE for the worst movie I've ever seen."
3,Too short.,"""Trifles"" is the play I read. This play, if longer, would have been even better. The theme is just on the surface and can be overlooked. Without any background for the characters, I couldn't really feel for the men or women. I ""sorta"" recommend."
2,Historical ONLY...outdated information,"Originally published in 1978, this book provides a historical understanding of the beginning of recognition of incest as a real problem within society. Written from a feminist perspective, it combines information within the framework of the feminist movement. In today's context, the material it covers generates anger at how little was understood about this issue in that era. The book incorporates interviews from victims, fathers, and mothers which ring true, but the author's interpretation of those words may bring anger and disbelief. We know now that incest is not solely attributable to living in a patriarchal society and that offenders are not easily rehabilitated. If you want to understand how much progress we have made, this book provides that perspective. Be warned that it looks at ALL the issues through a highly feminist viewpoint."
3,Okay...,"There was nothing wrong with the characters, or the story for that matter, but I found that too much time was dedicated to outside events, rather than what was between Zeke and Natalie."
2,A Coulter disappointment!,"I Love Catherine Anderson's writing style and the different angles of love that she is able to write about, but this one was just a boring read. Nathalie is recently divorced with 2 kids and Zeke is the neighbor whose home was vandalized by Nathalie's son. Zeke agrees to let Chad, her son, work of the debt and soon enough they fall in love.This book just didn't do it for me. Zeke was boring and so was Nathalie. There was no depth to their characters, I just felt like they went through the motions and Zeke was a bit too perfect to me. Pretty easy read, but if you are used to Catherine's Coulter novels, don't expect too much. The secondary characters were really just flat and even some of the dialogue with the Coulter family didn' seem as interesting as they usually are.As a Coulter family fan I still would recommend reading it as part of the series."
4,Good book,I really like the Coulter family stories. It is refreshing to read books about people who overcome real life handicaps.
4,Another good Anderson book,This is a light hearted book with lots of humor. Usually in Anderson book the characters have disabilities or some kind of emotional trauma. These characters are more reminiscent of Susan Elizabeth Phillips.
5,This Author Is Great,"I just received my copy of Bright Eyes and I am now on the last page. I have never enjoyed a book as much as I did this one and I could not put it down. This author just keeps getting better with every book she writes. Just when you think she has wrote the best book, she comes out with another one even better than the previous book. Thank you Catherine..."
4,Good Read,"I picked up this book because I liked the title, I have never read any Catherine Anderson books before. I really liked this book, I liked Natalie's character how she wanted to be independant and didnt want Zeke to order her around. I didn't like Zeke's character, I thought he was way to perfect and no guy is that perfect. I thought Rosie was adorable, but can 4 year olds really talk like that? I don't even talk that perfect and Im 17. She uses huge words that she doesnt know what they mean and she's never even been in school. And I don't think Chad would have overcome his anger that fast just because of Zeke, who he doesnt even know."
4,delightful literary biography,"this book - like the life of mencken and his friends that it depicts - is astonishing and delightful. mayfield was the best friend of mencken's wife sara haardt. just four little debs growing up in montgomery, alabama: mayfield, hardt. zelda fitzgerald, and tallulah bankhead. the book is gossipy and full of name-dropping, but for all that delightful, and if you're going to drop names, i suppose it might as well be dorothy parker, ambrose bierce, clarence darrow. the wit flows furiously. the boozesoakedness of it all is a bit disturbing in retrospect, particularly when you look at the casualties, such as the fitzgeralds."
4,Poor little lamb,"My son got this lamb as a baptism gift and decided to make it his lovey. Over the past couple of years, the poor thing has lost its blanket, stopped praying and turned a nasty gray color, but my son is still crazy about it. After unsuccessful attempts at surface cleaning, the prayer wasn't really working anymore, so I tried to wash it in the washing machine to at least kill the germs, which you are not supposed to do. That's when the blanket came off and the prayer stopped working completely. I bought a new one, but I'm waiting for the right time to make the switch. I suggest that if you plan to buy one for a young child, buy at least two and switch them out to share the wear. The fact they are not machine washable is a real problem."
3,"Informative, but simplistic designs","Teenagers would have a ball with these techniques. However, I found the jewelry designs too simplistic & not really something I might wear. I have been silversmithing for a number of years & was interested in shaping & wrapping wire techniques to add to my designs, but these were way too simplistic. Pictures for wrapping steps were hand drawn, but provided clear instructions. Ther were a few color photos of fabricated jewelry."
2,"Okay, but slightly strange & boring...","Had I not received this book as a gift, I would return it ASAP! The bulk of the projects consist of oddly shaped links attached to eachother to create ""chains"". Also, the way the book is set up makes it very difficult to follow, and the pictures are not close in proximity to the actual instructions, which really sucks! I must admit there is one particular design that I very much like, and I made a lovely bracelet from. I suppose if you're really into shaping wire, and nothing more, than this might be something you'd enjoy."
5,Good teaching manual,"Good value for the price. Detailed instructions for the beginner that are easy to follow. The projects in the book could be easily adapted for your own designs, adding stones, beads, etc. A good basic teaching manual."
2,Making Wire Jewelry,Younger wire makers will appreciate this book. The patterns are simple and use only wire in repeated designs joined together. The ring section is very simple and is only for someone just starting out in wire. Do not purchase this item if you have any expierence in wire jewelry--only if just starting out.
4,Looks cool,this thing is cool if you want skull items in your bathroom i keep my downstairs bathroom normal then for our upstairs bathroom its done in skulls.And no this is not for decoration we actually use it
5,love smallville,"The product arrived in excellent shape- shipped via USPS- a dying breed, but better than when it was shipped UPS. I had to return the first one since it was damaged in shipping. I haven't watched the DVDs yet but I assume they are all okay. There's nothing else to review since it is a known entity and if you are a Smallville fan this is a must. I would have gotten the complete set since I think there may be things in there that are not in here but I bought each season separately already. Enjoy! And Amazon- excellent customer service."
4,Smallville never disappoints!,"I'm almost done with my collections. Only need seasons 6 and 7. The product was delivered on time but the only thing was that when I opened it the case kind of well apart on the inside. I think its more of a manufactuer problem, but it would have been nice if it came intact. The videos look fine (although I haven't played them yet) and that's the most important part."
5,Love it!,I have always love the smallville series and this final season does a very good job on ending the series. I will say that it did not end the way that I had hopped but none the less the season was excellent!
5,"Great Season, Great Cast and Great Show.","Great Cast, Great Acting. I loved how Clark was transported to a parrallel world where everything was different and he was the bad guy."
5,One of the greatest Smallville episodes of all times.,This is by far one of my favorite episodes of the entire Smallville Epic. I've been a Smallville fan since 2005 and own every season. I was hit off guard to see the return of Brainiac from season 5 and the role he plays in opening up Clarks eyes in this episode. It was also a great idea for the Smallville High School Reunion and the flashbacks from the past. This episode was filled with fun and i enjoyed every minute.
5,The Perfect End to a Perfect Series,"I've never seen a series that so eloquently stayed to the story line while building the characters to the peak of the story line. Congratulations to the CW and everyone involved with Smallville. A timeless addition to the Superman saga.Accolades to the writers, directors, actors, and yes even the network for the commitment to stay with the series and see it to the end. A lot of networks could learn from the WB/CW. Wake up ABC, NBC, CBS, SyFy because your lack of commitment to a series is exactly why this series and CW get great reviews and those networks end up with lagging ratings."
4,Smallville Rocks Hard,I absolutely loved Season 10 for about 12 or 13 episodes. The first episode was absolutely friggin brilliant. The whole Lex Luthor thing even seemed feasible....a bit of a stretch...but I was willing to go with it. The episodes that followed in which they were trying to figure out how their relationship could work was the brightest spot of the whole season for me. That whole darkness and cape business seemed to drag the storylines down. I wish the focus would have stayed on Clark and Lois. Loved the show. Hope their is a spin off of some kind in the future.
4,Smallville: The Complete Tenth Season,"The product was excellent and a welcomed end. Seeing that Smallville was a pre-Superman time period, I was bothered by how the series continually limited his ability, stretched out his learning curve, and dumb down his intellect. The series was entertaining and disturbing at the same time. ""Somebody Save Me"" will always be a memorable tune."
2,Over - All: Dissapointing,"As a long-time Smallville fan, the last season wrap-up of this decade long series is somewhat disappointing. A few stand-out episodes pepper the season early on and Erica Durance's Lois Lane charms us through and through. However, fans who loyally waited for Clark to get the suit and finally fly under the colors of his heroic destiny will be sorely disappointed. The obvious ""blue-screen"" effects and the fact that Clark was in costume for what was probably less than 8 minutes at the end of the final episode suggest that the creators of the series begrudgingly gave fans what they were clamoring for -- and only at the last moment. Other plot and character inconsistencies abound. The last season has a few golden moments, but they're planted like Easter egg gifts among an otherwise limited vision of one of our most enduring American heroes."
3,Middle was better than the end,"My favorite episodes of Smallville were when they introduced other superhero characters. So I LOVED the beginning part of this season where they had a bunch of different superheroes. But at the end? Clark adopts ""superboy"" and when Clark disappears for 3 weeks, no mention of Superboy. The same with the Wedding (that did not happen). No superheros show up to see their best friend get married? Come on? What a let down. As for budgeting, the budgeting constraints were very obvious in the 2nd half of this season. Very low budget. If you watched this show all of the way through, you are going to buy the tenth season no matter what. For me, from what was being said at the beginning of the season, and the quality of the first half of the tenth season, I was disappointed in the second half of the tenth season."
5,PERFECT,"the movie came to my door before the promised date, and in perfect condition. I gave this to my husband as a christmas present and he has already finished the series."
2,Did they miss something in the Edit Room?,"This episode sure seemed pretty hacked to me. Clark saves Tess from battling Granny Goodness's soldiers, and suddenly he's back at the farm looking for Lois. What happened with the Orphanage? Did they just leave all the kids there? What about the little girl he left in the electrical room? If we're to assume they did call authorities and shut it down, how did Granny escape? Tess is trying to dial for help on an old rotary phone in the Orphanage. They have all this cutting-edge technology in the Watch Tower, but she doesn't have a cell phone? Why would granny leave the ballerina music box in Tess's room when she could have, oh, I don't know, grabbed Tess instead? Huge holes abound.I'm a fan of the series, but man, this episode was a mess."
5,Amazing Finale!,"Smallville was about being a hero instead of just about someone flying around in tights. I thought the finale proved that to everyone. I thought the finale set off on a cliffhanger ""to be continued in the comic books."" Thank you to anyone who made Smallville into what it was and it doesn't matter how much people watched the show, it mattered how good the show was."
1,Kent?,"Today I watched the Episode ""Kent"". I have never said anything bad about a single smallville episode, but this episode was just incredibly stupid. I don't understand why they needed to do another alternate universe episode. they did one and that was fine. All I got from this, was that Clark decides to sell the farm."
3,"Good season, but awful finale. What happened, Alfred? Miles?","Without including spoilers, I would like to say that this was a great series in the Superman mythology. I really appreciated the time taken to research the history of the story and come up with compelling, updated story lines. This season, the writing staff seemed to know where they wanted to go, a wedding between Clark and Lois. As a viewer, this was pathetic. It had been done before at least 3 times in the series and this particular wedding was the most boring of them all. The final episode was VERY self-indulgent through a boring montage of past episodes and didn't address some of the most interesting plot-lines. What happened to LANA?!?!This box set is actually pretty good, however. The season in entirety is very well done.I'm not sad I watched it because I have enjoyed the series so much. I'm just left with a disappointed taste in my mouth from the conclusion episode."
3,final episode wasnt that great,"final season was so- so. the best seasons was 1-7, than after that was so-so, and smallville didn't go out on a high note"
1,This would make baby Jesus Cry,"You would think that after almost 10 full seasons (180+ episodes) that Clark Kent would atleast learned how to fly. Well, ladies and gentlemen he still hasn't learned how to fly. It also seems that Smallville will never come full circle on anything because they keep having episodes about Zod, Lex, Lionel, etc. Plus some of these episodes don't make any sense and would make a person lose brain cells by watching them. This used to be one of my favorite shows, but now everytime I see the name 'Smallville' I cringe."
1,cliche galore,"What a disappointment! Writers block supreme! they resurrected every villain, acquaintance, and relative of Clarks. They made him face and defeat every one he ever fought and then killed them off again. So many flashbacks the viewer often lost sight of what was actually going on. More alternate dimensions, got sent back to the phantom zone, the Luthers, on again off again weddings, and any other trite cliche you can think of. Barely watchable and certainly not worth the price."
1,BLECH! Season 1 was good. By season 10 the show was bad. The finale had him in cgi - lol bad!,"The show worked at its core when Jonathan Kent was still on and you had father and son moments. The dynamic of him with his parents made the show like you'd expect an early start of Clark's life to be. Somehow by season 10, they got wayyyyyy off track! The whole blue blur crap, and Clark looking like the only idiot alien who is afraid to fly... It just got bad.The finale was pretty pathetic in that you don't see him in the full suit. They just cgi (and bad cgi) him into a crappy costume that you get a glimpse as he helps a plane ala Reeve/Routh from the movies.EWWW stay away from this one folks and wait for the ""Man of Steel"" movie starring Henry Cavill."
1,Pititful,So for the last 10 seasons Clark Kent was a self-doubting and scared individual when it came to what role he was supposed to be and about his powers. Now all of a sudden Clark Kent does a 180 and is the superman. Even the last episode before the finale confirms this.The producers left too many questions unanswered. I really hate it when TV shows follow this path; 10 Years of slow character progress then they hurry up and rush the ending. If I was able to rate this with zero stars I would.
2,"One more season, uggh.","I loved seasons 1-5, from there the series takes a major nose dive. This season isn't the worst, that honor goes to the shortened (and woefully written) season 7, plagued by the writers strike. What really gets me going about this season is the obvious desire the producers had in cutting costs. For a series that became popular for its action, the tenth season is all talk. In season 1 & 2 you couldn't go two episodes without a car explosion.The ultimate betrayal for this -10 DVD season owning- fan was the finale. As like the rest of the season, this last episode was basically Clark and Louis chatting for 42 minutes. No huge show down, no huge anything. This is what I get for ten years of loyal viewing?"
1,Disappointed in Ann Arbor,"I bought this because of the low price and learned the adage (once again) ""you get what you pay for"". The box is pretty, the manual confusing with a very non-standard way of describing keystroke actions. Most importantly, I couldn't keep the program running without a crash for any length of time (I have a 3 year old PC system running Windows 95 with a 266MHz processor). I finally gave up trying to use it."
2,The standard edition for ancient philosophers is Le Dictionnaire des Philosophes Antiques (more than 4 vol.),The standard edition for ancient philosophers now is Le Dictionnaire des Philosophes Antiques (more than 4 vol.). DPhA (in French) is highly recommended for all libraries with collections in classical philosophy.
4,hoover/empower/vacuum cleaner,"The vaccum cleaner is easy to use, good suction power, lightweight, well made, and a great dollar value."
3,Good Vacuums,"I've used Hoover uprights for years, and have been very pleased with them. This vacuum is ok. It does an average job, not great. It is largely plastic, as is true of too many products today --- more petroleum wasted. I would have bought a better vacuum if I had more carpet space. Living in Florida, I only have two carpeted rooms. The rest is tile. This was the major factor in choosing a cheaper vac."
3,Good Vacuum..,"This vacuum does the job. It cleans all floors, and the attachments are great. The only issue is that it's a little cumbersome to move around, and it's rather loud. There is a silent mode, but it's still loud. I once heard that a German vacuum manufacturer made a vacuum that was near silent, but no one would buy it because they attributed the suction noise to performance. I wouldn't make that mistake with this machine. It works great, but it should be quiter... no one would think that it wasn't great just because it was silent!!"
3,Suction is Great.... That is WHEN it works :shrug:,"I spent over an hour trying to decide to purchase this or not.... Finally I convinced myself it was a great deal and took the jump. I got it home, took it upstairs and within THREE minutes the belt snapped.. I did NOT catch anything in it, my carpet is basically NEW with NO snags... You can imagine how upset I was....The suction is VERY good thus the 3 stars.... It's a BEAR to clean as stated in previous reviews.... And you DO have to clean it after every use (IMO)....Overall, it does it's job but quite honestly I don't think it's worth the hundred bucks I spent on it..... I've had others that have cost half of that.... that have done just as good of job....."
1,Vacuum,"Very poor quality.You have to empty the dirt cup often, the power switches and wisper mode don't work.Wish I had my old vacume back."
1,Hoover Doesn't Live Up to It's Name,"Bought the green older version about 1 1/2 years ago. Has been repaired once for $50 and has just died again,after months of just ok suction. It is loud-(hush mode is no better), heavy, blows dirt on your ankles, difficult to use on stairs, and the hose comes unattached occasionally. So dissappointing for a Hoover. My parents still have theirs from about 30 years ago (while no repairs, probably doesn't pick up as well as they think). Hoover's quality has definitely gone downhill. The cannister/filter is disgusting to clean, spreading dirt/dust all over. Give me a bagged model anytime. Actually, after much research, I just ordered an upgraded Bissell bagless model from Amazon that almost 100 reviewers gave 4 1/2 stars. I never put too much thought into my vacuum until this model-there were just so many issues, it made me want/expect better."
1,Sooo Disappointing! No longevity,"I bought this about a year ago from Target. It's now completely broken.I live in a small one bed-room apartment. With a couple rugs to clean and one dog (not to clean! obviously).Pieces have literally broken off underneath it. Starting at the 6 month point.I am so disappointed that it didn't last very long. Vacuums Should have more longevity, but i guess you get what you pay for.I'm going to pony up for a Dyson now."
3,Hoover Upright Vacuum - U5262-910,Product had broken parts when received - no carton damage. It took nearly a month for Hoover to send replacment parts. Unit seems to operate satisfactorily now.
3,Good on only carpet,"I got this vacuum after reading the reviews and getting info on it from consumer reports. It works really well on carpet, but on bare floors it is awful. It just sucks the dirt on the floor behind you, not in the vacuum! I am going to have to get a new one for the bare floors...disapointing."
1,Yuck - Try something different,"Maybe mine was a lemon, but this vacuum is terrible. It does not pick up dirt on our concrete floor. The dirt flies back and hits you in the ankles. The hush function did not have much difference in volumes when it arrived. Now it is the exact same, so this function does not work on my vacuum. I spend more time cleaning the filter than vacuuming. The stretch hose, must be a joke, since it does not stretch. You will definitely want an extension. Plus it is a two handed ordeal to put it back into place, unless there is a trick that I do not know.Even though I hate this vacuum, it seems to pick up dirt fine on carpet. It will reside upstairs for carpet only in our household.This model was so terrible, I just bought another vacuum, which works beautifully on our concrete floors. Hoover Elite Rewind purchased from Costco.Hoover U5507-900 Elite Rewind Bagless Upright"
2,Not As Advertised,Read the reviews on the Amazon sight and at Consumer Reports and chose it for that reason. Received the vacuum and after one use the brush no longer spun and there was no suction from the bottom. I contacted Hoover who was willing to ship me a belt but wouldn't hear of refunding some of my money for their remarkably unreliable product. So now I'm still without a vacuum while the 'new' one I bought is being repaired. Hoover considered the warranty repair as a 'gift' to me and they were doing me such a service by repairing their product for free after one use. I would steer away from Hoover products.
2,No way!,I purchased this vacuum based upon how it was rated by Consumer Reports. What a disappointment! It is supposed to work well on hard surfaces. It simply shoots out the back what it picks up in the front. A total bummer since my house is all tile! I would not recommend this vacuum.
2,Do NOT BUY THIS Vacuum,"This vacuum spits out the particles instead of sucking them up. It actually spits out and hits you at your feet. It does not suck-up dust, it just moves it from one place to another. Don't try to save money by buying this vacuum. It simply does not work."
2,hoover vacuum,This is a cheap vacuum and we are not impressed. Ability to vacuum marginal. Unfriendly to operate. Filter clogs easily. Rubber band drive breaks easily-. All said I would return this vacuum if I could.
3,Not a Dyson,"Not bad for 100.00, but.......Dont think you're getting a Dyson for less money. This unit doesn't even come close. It does work and pick up debris, however the filter and catch bin fill up quickly about five times faster then a bagged system. Once full the suction is all but lost and cleaning the thing takes a little bit of effort. You have to take the filter cartridge OUTSIDE! so you dont drop all the dust back in the house and bang it to get the dust out.Also, be wary of buying a reconditioned/used item. Mine was in good shape but it had the wrong size belt in it. Very upsetting until that was figured out."
2,Horrible for wood floors and a pain to empty,"I never really thought a ton about vacuum design...until I bought this. It works quite well at cleaning carpet. It doesn't work at all on wood floors. The hush mode is just as loud as the regular mode. It's bulky, heavy, and doesn't turn well. And cleaning out the bagless canister is messy, dusty, and just a royal pain. No matter how careful I am, I always end up with dust flying about. I've had this for a year and as soon as I can afford it, I am going to buy a good old-fashioned ""bag"" vacuum cleaner. There is no savings by going bagless...you still need to replace the filter every so often and that can be a good $15 dollars. I've never actually HATED a vacuum before, but I sure do hate this one."
2,Dissapointing,I found this book a real disappointment. More about planning your career in this area than actually the practicalities of doing the job.
2,Gerald Kovacich great cut and paste book,"This book had the potential to be great. But in the end does not deliver.About 40% of the book is Gerald Kovacich cutting and pasting from other books he and others have written.I did not like the organization of the book, and felt it lacked direction.The footnotes were repetitive often, and Kovacich is constantly footnoting and referencing other books he has written."
3,"Good information, very dry","This book has good information but is very, very dry. I had to fight very hard to not fall asleep at times.Kovacich does make some very good points about balancing the information security needs with the needs of the business. He also stress that information security needs to utilize existing business processes and be aligned with the goals of the organization. This is the best material he provides and details in several chapters."
3,Check out Cross-Collateral and Looking Thru instead.,"Those are absolutely awesome Passport albums, especially Cross-Collateral. Handmade isn't bad either. Yes, this is a Passport album with the signature sound, and it's interesting in a historical sense, but it just doesn't jump out and grab me the way Cross-Collateral does."
3,"Nice watch, but clasp not great","It's an attractive and functional watch, but the clasp just slides around so that it's just a matter of time until it slips off and my child loses it. The clasp isn't secure at all."
4,"Fun Platformer, Pretty Formulaic!","I have loved Asterix and Obelix ever since, as a child, I read the comics in French class. When I heard that this game was coming out after a moderate European release, I had to pick it up right away.Other reviews were tepid, likely because this game adds nothing new to the platforming genre. It's full of ""collect 30 helmets"" and ""beat up x number of Roman soldiers"", and you get to alternate between Asterix (fast and nimble) and Obelix (strong and powerful).The graphics are cute, the sound is appropriate. I find the humor in the comics (e.g. making fun of Latin) funny, and it is carried into this game."
4,repeative but fun,"This is a fun game to play and it's not that hard. pretty simple levels and good controls (which is definately a plus). The only 2 problems I came across which aren't that bad are; occasional minor glitches (usually when you're running in an area with no romans to beat up or being launched in the air) and sometimes the camera angle can be a pain. Other than those 2 minor flaws this is a decent game to purchase. I never was too familiar with the Asterix and Obelix characters but I still knew about them, and that made me get this game. Fans of the characters should really enjoy this especially."
4,amazing quality,"Hey, I wasn't expecting much from this game but thanks to a friend who recommended it to me (I trust his opinion a lot) he was actually right- we have a good game here, folks!You have plenty of things to do in the game, mainly taking care of Roman soldiers. The animation is truly bizarre and the action is pretty interesting and hilarious as well.You have up to 40 levels to complete, and I can't really find any complaints with the game. There's plenty of surprises awaiting you in each of the levels, too."
5,Excellent comprehensive information on drugs used in vet-med,"Good information on extra-label uses of animal and human drugs for veterinary medical professionals. Lists dosages for large, small, and exotic species. Well organized and easy to use. A great value."
2,Not what I was expecting,"I'm not sure what book the other reviewers were writing about, but it wasn't this title. The book I am reviewing is: Veterinary Drug Handbook Client Information Edition by Gigi Davidson and Donald C. Plumb.This book contains entries for the most commonly prescribed drugs in veterinary use in layman's terms for clients. It does not contain pharmakonetics, extra-label uses, contraindications, dosages, concentrations ect. It is a stretch of the imagination that this would even be considered for use as a textbook.My advice for you: if you are a student in a veterinary program, get the newest edition of Plumb's Veterinary Drug Handbook. If you are a pet lover, pet owner or other layperson, then this is the book you are looking for; it provides information on many drugs that are commonly prescribed by your veterinarian in plain English that is clear and easy to understand."
3,Required for college Course,"I thought that I had purchased the regular version of the book, but it ended up being the instructors edition. It has a lot of interesting passages which help generate discusssion."
4,DANGEROUS KISS (LUCK SANTANGELO),"A little slow for me at first but I did like this book . Love the Luck character as well as all the others, but sometime it was a little crazy trying to keep up with all of them. Just love Jackie Collins!"
5,OH MAN I CANNOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN!,"Jacie Collins' books since the last Lucky novel (which is one of my top 5 favorite books of hers) have not been that impressive. In fact, they have all paled next to ""Revenge"". I knew this one would kick butt, and it does! I CANNOT put it down, since I started reading it yesterday. It just keeps getting better and better. It's so fun to read about continuing characters like Jack Nicholson and Madon--oops! I mean Charlie Dollar and Venus. (even though I can't stand Madonna, Venus is much more likeable than she is). Now the new characters, such as Naomi Campbell and Tyra Banks-oops, I mean Lina and DiDi are entertaining too (though so far nothing's been able to top the last one where the German Victoria's Secret Model turns out to really be a man!) Jackie Collins always satisfies when she writes about Lucky. I'm in the last 100 pages of this book now and you could not pay me enough to put it down and not find out what happens next. To be continued."
5,A Great Read!,I've just started the novel and already can't put the book down. Jackie Collins certainly have a way of taking you to the stars and back...Truly a book to share with friends and family since it teaches you the importance of these relationships.....a book with lessons about life...
2,entertaining but too predictable read,I was bored with the first 40 pages as it recounted the history of each character - if you have read the other four books you don't need all this information. I have loved the other 'Lucky' books but found this one very predicable and unbelievable - too much like the last book with Lucky and Lennie having their 'marital difficulties'. Jackie Collins should put Lucky to rest and write about a whole new set of characters - there is only so much that can happen to one woman and it has all happened to Lucky already!
4,"Jackie Collins does it again, another best seller.",This book was very good. The plot thickens and thickens. Jackie can keep a reader up all night wanting to finish one of her books. I could not wait until it hit the stands. It seems it's too long before she releases her next book. Now I'm waiting for the next one!
2,Retire Lucky!!!!!,Very disappointed. Lucky has become an unbelievable character. Jackie Collins should reitre the whole Lucky Santangelo series.
3,1/2,"Before Dangerous Kiss, every Lucky novel was an improvement from the last. That's why I was hoping for this to be the best Lucky novel, and Lucky could end at her best. Unfortunately, this one almost makes Chances look better!This is ""A Lucky Santangelo Novel"", yet Lucky only plays a secondary part. Lucky's persona we all knew and loved in her prior adventures is much more passive, which is a major letdown. Another thing that I must say is that most of the characters crossing over from other Lucky novels serve no point in the novel, and you almost want to yell at the book, wondering why they are wasting pages.Lucky has been a lot of fun, but I think it is time to leave her be, and move on to bigger and better things."
3,Not her best,"I could hardly wait for this book to come out,but after reading it I feel I should have gone to the library and got it instead of spending the money. Too much hype for not a really great story.It was so predictable we all knew were the author was going. I love all her books but I was disapointed in this one."
3,"Entertaining, but not her best!","This book lacked heart. There were too many things going on throughout the entire story. Collins jumped ahead by months leaving you to wonder and wanting to see how things evolved. Because most of the characters were well defined in earlier books you had a great understanding of their personalities, but the new characters were vague and I missed getting into the old characters. I am a huge Lucky and Gino fan and missed not seeing their usual antics. Lucky fans will enjoy this book (of course) but the heart and that feeling of not being able to put it down will be lost. Hopefully the next book will concentrate on smaller, more intimate story lines about the Santangelo family."
5,Jackie Collins is by far the best!!!!!,"""Dangerous Kiss"" was such a great book that I stayed up WAY later than I should have to read it!! Lucky is the best!!! ""Chances"" was my first Collins read, and I was done by the end of the summer with the rest. I especially love the fact that the chapters are short and interesting. I wish Jackie could write faster because she simply ROCKS!!!!!"
4,A Great Companion for Meetings!,"I purchased this book many years ago after graduating from college. My degree was in office administration and there were no training courses or discussions regarding taking minutes at meetings. I had landed a job that required taking minutes at various board, committee, task force meetings (out of town and locally). The book was very helpful to me in terms of how to take minutes, organizing my minutes on paper, and avoiding redundancy (especially using the ""How to Say It"" section). I received many compliments on my ability to take ""good"" minutes. It's been over ten years since I've had that job. I now have another job where I am required to take minutes. At first, I was a little panic stricken because I had not taken minutes in over ten years. Then I remembered this book that had been so helpful to me in the past and starting referring to it once again. It is a very valuable resource for anyone taking minutes."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"This book looks as though it was typed on a typewriter. Although the information is not obsolete, the style and format certainly are. The information in this book was not anything most of you don't already know (book a meeting room? Duh!). Most of the information on how to book a room, schedule a meeting, etc., totally depends on the company you are working for. There was nothing in this book that ""sparked"" the task of taking minutes."
1,Misinformation- not even worth one star,"Waste of money. There are a number of mistakes in the book. ""Old Business"" has not been used for over 30 years. It is ""Unfinished Business"". The Agenda items are not listed correctly and items missing. There are more accurate books on minutres. Suggest to do some research before buying and make sure you receive the correct information. The writer should of done some homework."
3,Not a great fit,"This bra is not a great fit (for me, at least), since the straps keep sliding down, and that's quite unpleasant as we all know. The good news is I only paid $8 for it at Marshalls ;-)"
3,"Icky ""Tan"" Padding","I am black and foolishly bought this bra and the very cute boyshorts. I didn't realize that the bra had padding the color of white skin. So when I put it on, it didn't match the sheer panty color. Ick.If you have a white/tan colored skin like the fake color of this padding, then buy this bra. Otherwise, if your have dark skin (or very pale skin, I guess) do not buy this bra.Padding is gross anyway. I guess I did notice the color because the model is white. Anyway the embroidery is nice, and the bra fit well. If your skin color matches, I would recommend buying it."
4,Very Nice Card and Well worth the price.,This card has the power of a geforce 2 and a ati.5 rage card combined it works perfect for new and old machines. And for AGP users you should have no problems at all installing this card. But the only conflict is that you may exprience difficulties in games where the monitor falls asleep or the computor shuts down. But eventually like i did youll fix the problem and there will be no trouble at all.Reccomended for users with high mhz pcs (5oo to 1ooo mhz)
1,GREAT film but AWFUL video,"I love this movie. The dialogue is poetry -- it contains some of the best lines I've ever heard in a movie. (And yes, I am talking about a Charles Bronson movie!) However, I urge you to avoid the video and wait to catch it on commercial TV. Ordinarily, I'd never ever say that, but this video is unique. It isn't letterboxed, but it isn't pan-and-scan, either. It's as if the camera just sits in the center of a wide scene and the actors come and go in and out of sight. Terribly frustrating. I even ended up giving my copy away. I'd go so far as to call this a truly great movie, but you're missing out if you let the video be your first exposure to it."
2,Don't Buy This Pan N Scam Product,"Wish a reivew had alerted me, but I should have checked the aspect ratio before purchase anyway. The movie is pan and scan other than the credits. A real rip-off. I'm not waiting to rate the movie, guess I'll do that whenever I get to SEE the whole thing. Whatever the strengths of the movie, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD PRODUCT."
4,Classic status?,"Is this a ""Hollywoodized"" action movie? Is Bronson chasing cars & ninjas? Is that what you want? (not what it is)This is a simple, imperfect tune about a bad-ass drifter in the 1930's who can street fight and make money doing it.Certain acting is great (James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Strother Martin)If you let yourself be immersed in it, you may ignore the imperfections and imagine that it is real and feel the toughness and fear of either losing a bet or losing a fight whichever hurts more. Bronson is tough, just plain tough. James Coburn is perfect in his role as a gambler/opportunist..."
1,defective dvd,the dvd stopped every 10 minutes. I finally gave up. I should have returned it. too bad because it is a favorite movie of mine.
5,classic Bronson,Great movie about a middle aged man doing what he has to do to survive in the great depression.
1,This movie wasn't that good,How can I characterize what went on before me for about 2 hours. I can't
4,Hard Times - my review,"I saw this movie a long time ago.It aged pretty well because the film's story was set in the 20th Century's depression era (circa 1930's).So everything looking so non-modern is OK. As you checkout the film's characters you get sucked intotheir problems how they survive and live in a world of with no jobs and with little or no money. For me thismovie is one those where the storyline, the action, the acting, the music and the editting all seem to justgel together. The bare-knuckles fight scenes were well choreographed. No kung-fu here, but for a fewminutes here and there it makes me want to compare it with the Rocky movies' fight scenes for intensityand grittiness. That's pretty good for a movie that's older than Rocky."
2,Good film / So-so tape,"HARD TIMES (1975) - (Walter Hill, dir.)With Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Jill Ireland and Strother Martin.Set in New Orleans in the early '30s, this streetboxer story is considered by many to be Bronson's best movie.""Hard Times"" is quite enjoyable but this particular edition from GOODTIMES only rates two stars because of manufacturing limitations. The brand dubbed tapes in LP mode, thus they have a degraded picture quality compared to SP transfers. Audio is linear mono instead of the far superior HiFi stereo.For anyone who seeks a quality VHS of this work, you'll be pleased with the1996 SONY/COLUMBIAversion."
4,Great DVD transfer lookin' good in widescreen!!!,"For anyone who loves Coburn/Bronson, great direction, stylistic cinematography or period films, this is it. I was oh-so impressed with how great this movie looks in 2.35 widescreen. Great transfer and a great price!! The ending was a bit anti-climatic, but this disc is definately staying in the collection. They don't make 'em like James Coburn or Charles Bronson anymore......."
4,Charles Bronson's best,"Finally released on a quality medium, Charles Bronson's best movie is a delight. His quiet, understated aproach to a ""tough guy"" role is a refreshing change from the overwrought blowhards we see too often today. James Coburn plays the sleazy promoter with style, and great supporting roles are presented by Jill Ireland and Strother Martin. Robert Tessier is one mean dude.The anamorphic transfer is tremendous. A minor classic."
4,"Realistic, until the end.","One thing confused me about this movie. Bronson's past. He seems to possibly be the best streetfighter in the country. Or could have been at one time. He obviously came down south to make money. Could he not make money up North because of an unbeatable reputation? I wanted to know these things. Did not believe Chaney would give all that money to Coburn and Poe at the end. Before the final fight he said he owed Speed nothing. Best things about the film. It's pacing. It seems everyone is acting in slow motion ( which was a great change from todays overly edited films ), except ""Speed"". Chaney taking on a bar and its patrons ( for a good reason ) and teaching a lesson in ettiquet. DVD transfer was poor."
5,Highly under-rated. A terrific movie.,"I won't get into the plot here. I would rather speak of the movie as a whole. Charles Bronson gives what might be the best performance of his career. In the movie he doesn't speak all that much. He does his talking with his fists, body language and facial expressions. The storyline, the settings, the dialog and the acting are all terrific. ""Hard Times"" has the same feel and aura that makes ""Chinatown"" (Jack Nicholson) such a great movie. Even if you are not a Charles Bronson fan, watch this movie for all it's other attributes. This might be one of the most under-rated movies I have ever seen. It's well worth watching."
3,A good story,"This wasn't the best written book I've ever read. It seems to have been written for a youth audience, not overly sophisticated writing, but a good story nonetheless. For the history purist, there are a few inconsistencies, such as words like ""holographic"" in normal conversation, and none of the genteel language one would expect from the late 1700's. Putting those details aside, though, it had some interesting information on the secret communications that kept the revolution going. I'd give it about 3-1/2 stars."
3,"Arrive sealed, but does not work in PC.","Arrived sealed in manufacture anti-static plastic bag. After install on motherboard, PC can not boot past initial POST. Checked web site, says Registered memory is not for PC boards - it is used on server boards.I believe the product should be good and sound, but make sure you used it in servers, not desktop PC.It is different from what the picture looks like - suggest Amazon.com take a new photo."
2,It was a bit slow.,"It seems that Mr. Landes tried a bit too hard to write a book rather then an article. If a good editor worked on this it would have been an intersting article for a magazine such as Smithsonian. Although I bought the book because of seeing if there was any historical perspective, I found that it lacked detail that would have made me connect or say wow."
4,Looking back to learn,"Certainly not a book for an ambitious manager in a hurry, but for guys who can lean back for a few hours and have time to contemplate: it's a very good read.Landes' focus is very big business. But standing back - the patterns he describes are applicable to all kinds of families and - presumably - concern most of us.Landes describes these family patterns extremely well, looks closely at religious aspects too. It's this comprehensive view which renders his book so interesting."
3,Love this watch! Wish it worked all the time.,"I'm picky about watches and this had everything I wanted in a low budget field watch. Stainless case, large bold hands and Arabic numerals, mineral crystal, date, and indiglo. The style is great and I've actually gotten random compliments on it. Pretty good for a Timex!The down side. The band came apart after about two months. No sweat, I wanted a NATO band anyway. The Date function is the weakness. Every two or three weeks it randomly gains or looses a day or two. Might be an issue with the crown popping out a bit but when I try to set the date i have to fiddle with it to get it to move. Its like there is a small gear that is partially stripped or not quite fully engaging. Anyway, it happens enough that I am looking for a new watch. Too bad. I really like it otherwise."
3,good watch but date is too small,"Nice easy to read dial. Indiglo works nicely. Keeps accurate time. Simple watch. No frills. Now the bad stuff. Watch band was made for tiny wrists. I don't like straps anyway because they are dangerous around machinery so I replace it with a twist-o-flex band. Much safer if you get it caught on something.Date is a joke. Very hard to read for people who need glasses. Should be much bigger. I did not even bother to use it. Crystal is flat, found out they break easily. I went to take off my work gloves and it pulled my watch off and hit the floor and crystal broke in a bunch of pieces. Jeweler wants 35 dollars to replace so watch is now junk unless I buy a crystal and replace myself."
4,Would have gotten 5 stars...,"This would have gotten 5 stars if the adjustment dial didn't sheer, and pop out one day. I sent in the watch to Timex for a warranty replacement, which came after about 6 weeks. No issues with the replacement so far."
5,"Add to Cart, Just Do It.","If you're indecisive about getting this watch, you should get it. The picture does not say it all. The bezel is actually a bit darker, but it looks better anyways. The band also has a nice feel to it. In addition, the time function works and the date function work flawlessly. It's so easy to set the date, too. I've had this watch for a couple of months and I have not had any problems so far. This is my first analog watch and I'm very happy with it. Once this watch reaches its end of the line, i will be replacing it with another timex, if not the exact same, watch. If you buy this watch, you won't regret it."
3,Incorect Time,"Hello, I recived this watch 2 days ago. It's very comfortable, it has a nice size and colour.But there is one defect: It stays 3-4 minutes back in a day.I think the reason is a battery. I will change it and update this review."
4,"Looks great, but sometimes stops ticking.","Looks great and works great 95% of the time. I've had this watch for 5 months and I wear it 24/7. It is exactly the watch I was looking for - Tells time and day with an easy to hit backlight.Upside: I can activate the backlight by bending my hand back against the crown. Being able to check the time in the dark without having to empty my hands is great.Downside: Unfortunately the crown pops loose every once in a while effectively stopping the tracking of time. This has caused me develop a habit of syncing my watch every morning (although it is still perfect 19 times out of 20). I've learned to live with it, but when timing is crucial I get anxiety over whether or not my watch has gone out of sync or not.I will continue to use the watch until it croaks or gets worse, but I don't think I would buy another. I would hesitate to recommend it to a friend."
3,It's ok,"It's juust ok. All I wanted was a watch for work that would be banged around. This is my second one, the last one lasted 12yrs. The date does'nt work but I don't care. I definately wanted the illumination, it lasted 12yrs. on my old one. If you want a decent time piece at a resonable price, grab it."
4,beautiful simplicity,"This is a beautiful watch in its open readable, simplicity. The face is large but not ostentatious and the hands are easy to see. The colors are subtle which adds to its dignity. The indigo lights up the entire face of the watch and the leather strap is much softer than I though it would be. The only concerns are that the date is nearly impossible to read and the indigo light only shows while you are holding down the side button. You can't tap it and look at it the way you do for many digital watches."
2,""" Not A Total Loss ""","This is one of those ""Love it or hate it"" Passport recordings that seemed as though it was caught between Jazz/Fusion and Disco. Originally released in 1978. I personally don't like too much of the vocalists featured on some of the Passport recordings over the years and this one is a real downer for me. However, the song ""Dreamware"" is the only palatable song on the whole disk. It seems as though it would be better suited for the album ""Oceanliner"". All in all not a good example of Klaus's genius but, it took a lot of guts to release such a risky album as this one, and proves that Klaus Doldinger is the boss of his music."
2,Decent Basics...Horrible Explanations,"This has a decent coverage of the basics of most of what you need to know for the test, but its sample tests are horrible. Obviously, the SAT II Literature test is not a difficult level of analysis and thus its answers should be easy to explain and very concrete. Compare this books questions to those on collegeboard and the difference is apparent; this book fails to adequately justify its answers, often dismissing the answer similar to the correct answer as being ""less accurate"" rather than indicating evidence from the text."
5,Haribo Piratos,"has always been one of my favorite kinds of salmiak licorices, its salty, and full flavored, this candy is a must for anyone that enjoy the strong taste of a ammonia salt, very long lasting and highly addictive."
5,Tracy has done it again!,"Wow....Tracy deserves a home run for this one. This was the second novel I've read by Tracy Price-Thompson. I have not been disapointed yet. The book is all that ya'll. This novel features sex, lies, and secrets that will blow your mind.Add me to the fan club!"
4,"Good Book, Kinda Crazy!","This book was funny, crazy and way out there in left field at times! I thought Kevin and Fancy's marriage was so out there in left field! I didn't really care for it! Now, I did like the storyline about Sparkle and Phil! I loved how their relationship evolved! That was the best part of this book for me. Sparkle was too funny! The author has a great sense of humor and also displayed a serious side with the HIV/AIDS situations. This was my first book by Tracy-Price Thompson and I will read others."
4,"Rand McNally Encyclopedia of Military Aircraft, 1914-1980","The Book was received in very good condition, including the dust cover intact.An excellent value considering the price I paid for the book. Only negative was the mail time for this particular item. I ordered 3 similar items and all 3 of the other items arrived with in 7-10 days of placing the order; the above item took over 3 weeks to arrive."
5,A Mafia Masterpiece!,"Mafia the [edited] of the 1930's. Great deep story about a Mafia family. The Xbox version is alot more better than the PS2 version. The load times are very fast. It's fast like [edited] on Xbox. Graphics look 1,000 times better than PS2 version. Everything looks alot more cleaned up, and the details in everthing look a ton better. The levels are alot more clear than the PS2 version. When it's night time in the game you can see where your driving. In the PS2 version it was hard to see cause it was so dark. I haven't seen any draw distance so far. PS2 version had a big problem with that, where things would just pop up out of no where and you'd crash into something. Controls Works great with the Xbox Controller S. The game dosen't freeze either, the PS2 version froze alot for me. I think it was worth the wait, it's a whole lot better than the PS2 version. If your a fan of [edited] , or Mafia action check out Mafia for xbox or PC.Don't waste your time on the PS2 version."
1,game has never worked since my son got it,The game has never worked we paid money to have it cleaned and its still doesn't work. Don't buy from this company!
2,GTA is not fun in a model T,"While a lot of effort was put into this game's graphics, stop-motion animation and story the game play is very dull. Cars are slow. The fighting controls are weak. Even civilian AI is screwed; they kept driving through the streets like normal despite the fact that a massive gun fight was happening. Overall it just wasn't fun."
4,AWSOME!,This game is spectacular i had it for pc and it was great.The enviroment of Lost Heaven is so detailed.The missons are filled with gun shootouts! and alot of explosions.I reccomend that anyone who is upsessed with Mafia History should get this game!
1,waste of money,Half of the time your A STUPID TAXI DRIVER CARS ARE REALLY SLOW LIMITID WEAPONS LOAD TIMES ARE SLOW A WERY BAD GAME
5,Really interesting Info!!,"Really a great reference. Has 40 herbs discussed - each entry gives facts and folklore, how to grow the herb and harvest it, how to use it, and a recipe or two. Then there is a section on making herbal remedies, soaps, bath salts. I also really like the section for the kitchen which has recipes for different herbal blends to use as seasonings. Beautiful writing as well throughout."
3,only good for prevention,I wanted to get more information to treat dogs that bite which I did not get. The video focuses more on dealing with preventing bites and working with puppies. Unfortunately in real life we as trainers need more acurate and practical information on dealing with adult dogs that are biters. It would have been very interesting to see real life cases covered in the video. I would say the video is good for prevention but fails to talk about management and behaviour modification of adult dogs.
2,Primarily focused on puppy socialization,"This video did not live up to my expectations. I have a five-year-old Chihuahua who is somewhat afraid of people and lunges and bites when strangers get too close.The description of the video promised a simple behavior modification program to help deal with his aggression. Instead, Ian Dunbar simply says that behavior like this in old dogs is very difficult deal with, and focuses on puppy socialization in the video.Well, that's great if I had a puppy, but I adopted an older dog, and I need help now.I don't recommend this video for owners of older dogs with biting problems. If you have a puppy, it might be somewhat helpful, but there are better books."
3,Review of Universal Pan Lid,It works fine. It's nice to have a cover now for the pans that don't come with them. I wish there was a smaller version as well.
4,excellent quality,"I ordered these earrings, got them in excellent condition and were exactly what I wanted. I will definitely be considering ordering again. I was impressed with the prices as well."
3,their okay,"they are a little thin, but still nice for the price. the post could be a little longer for safety, but still do seem to be holding in well."
5,Awesome movie... awesome soundtrack!,"Anyone who went to see Grindhouse and is now looking at the soundtrack for Planet Terror, I know exactly why you're either thinking of or already have purchased it. It's because of the main title theme. Quite possibly one of the coolest movie themes ever composed.I'll spare you a detailed report of the CD. It's awesome. Possibly one of the best movie soundtracks ever composed, beats out the Sin City soundtrack... something I previously didn't think was possible. A must have for any music fans!"
4,Planet Terror-I enjoyed it,"Hey, it's Robert Rodriguez. I enjoyed it, not to say it is bad, but the movie gets a little to carried away and starts to be too comical, but same goes for ""Dusk to Dawn"". I have never been a Rose McGowan fan, but she is pretty good in this movie."
2,Soundtrack is Second Rate.,"The soundtrack to ""Planet Terror"" part of the ""Grindhouse"" double feature that appeared in movie theaters this past summer is at best medicore, and it is surely second rate compared to the soundtrack to ""Deathproof""Now THERE'S a awesome soundtrack to go out and buy. ""Deathproof"" definetly wasn't the better movie compared to ""Planet Terror"" , no argument about that, but the soundtrack to the movie beats the album for ""Planet Terror"" hands down."
4,Good to fall asleep to.,"I have several CD's in the ""Interludes"" series. They all consist of background sounds such as rain, thunder, waves, and wind sounds intermixed with mellow cello and keyboard/synthesizer sounds. I used these to help me fall asleep in the evening. I recommend keeping the volume level low, so the music/sounds are not distracting or engaging. I find these are useful for helping me sleep. Not recommended for driving or listening to in the workplace!"
4,Great quality but to small!!,"Maybe I did't read about the real size but how ever, they must call this bonbos MICRO bongos instead of mini bongos."
4,A Well-Chosen Collection,"""The Atlantic Years"" contains songs from FEOS, Satellite, Payable On Death, Testify, and the Warriors EP vol. 2. Additional tracks such as ""Sleeping Awake"" (written for Matrix Revolutions) and ""Truly Amazing"" (written for the Passion of the Christ) make welcome additions. But the highlights of this album come in the form of two new songs, ""Going in Blind"" and ""Here We Go"". ""Going In Blind"" is a driving, melancholy rocker about the death of a child. Musically, this song rivals hits from Satellite with every member of POD performing at full caliber. ""Here We Go"" is a an upbeat love song with a syncopated guitar part which carries the aggression and feel of ""Alive"". Overall, this CD is a welcome collection which combines hits, both old and new, into a very listenable hour of music."
5,Good album,This is a good change from all of the death metal I listen to. It good old fashion rock rap with a ill so cal Reggie style.
3,Interesting Youtube video,"[...] I figured this would be a good video, perhaps this band is in the wrong category here. the music is decent and cool but let us not be deceived by the message or the people who make no stand."
3,This is not my favorite!,"I bought this CD to listen the best songs of this band, but I'm not sure about this selection."
1,Why Greatest Hits Now? Is it Money?,"Doesn't it seem strange that POD has a greatest hits album already? Are they done and over? If you've been listening to them after Marcos left, it sure sounds that way. You have to ask yourself why Atlantic Records is pushing this album at this time. It seems to me not only is it a great way for them to make some extra money, but I think POD's best years are far behind them, and it seems that Atlantic is confirming this with this release."
1,This music...,The way to enjoy this music is sitting back in an easy smoking a pipe filled with something illegal.It sounds like a nine year old practicing for a recital when he'd much rather be having a root canal.
5,love story,I liked this story because Rebekah proves to be a very strong and determined individual in having to overcome her internal struggles. Many of the situations described seemed to be very realistic and I'm not ashamed to say I cried right along with her!
4,Good smell,"Good product to fill gift basket with. Although i don't personally use it, I would recommend it for your girlfriend!"
4,For Toy Commander or Re-Volt fans,"If you enjoy whimsical racing games (like Re-Volt or Toy Commander), I think you will like this game despite its lackluster published reviews. Very simple controls, interesting tracks, good sense of speed, colorful graphics, acceptable sound (you can turn the music off if you like). Due to the confined nature of the tracks, control of vehicles has to be very precise which may make this game a little too difficult for young gamers. Available used for under $3.00 at many outlets...worth the money."
4,W.E.S.,"Mr. Alper makes a good case for atheists. His rationals in each chapter of his book appear to be sound and supported by other authors' viewpoints.His book gives the reader pause for thought concerning the various religious doctrines and how the variety of religions have, and are, creating turmoil and conflicts throughout the world.Its interesting to consider all religious beliefs originated in our brains as a means of survival based on the consciousness of who we are.A book all clergy should read.It may make the world we live in a better place for all."
3,A Nice Introduction,"I enjoyed reading this book, although my interest waned toward the end. It provides a nice introduction from Matthew Alper's perspective. The author attempts to introduce scientific method, but his methodology is pretty weak and only marginally effective at supporting his premise. So, although I feel God is a bio-neurological impulse-leaving Alper preaching to the choir of me-, I was left unimpressed. Moreover, he avoids many aspects where he could not formulate a strong argument, so I have to demerit his work there. I was really surprised to read all of the endorsements, insomuch I can not see how anyone could see this work as groundbreaking. All of this said, this is still a pretty good book."
1,"""God""","Unscientific and purely speculative. I am very disappointed. I am a neuroscientist and I teach neurodevelopment. I focus on the pathogenesis of child Autism, Adolescent schizophrenia."
1,not scientific book,"I am still reading this book. I was expecting that this book would explain the ""GOD"" in our brain scientifically, but I think this book is not scientific. There are some logical jumps, which is kind of the author's faith."
3,"Good science, but poor Theology","Generaly a good book up to the point the author begins to draw theological conclusions from his scientific theory. Theology has long debated the question of Gods experience through the human faculties. This question and its inability to prove or disprove the existence of God has developed little since the middle ages.The larger picture he draws is flawed and easily dismissed through the updating of very old arguments. For example, we experience light because we are hard wired to do so. This hardwiring is the result of an evolutionary process. However, this does not mean light does not exist.An iteresting begining, but the author needs to give theology a little more respect and a much closer study. If he does so I suspect he will find lush grounds to think and write about."
2,Quite Disappointing,"I bought this book anticipating an intelligent discourse on the convergence of religion and neuroscience. However, what I found was a hugely self-indulgent personal drama documenting one man's journey to spirituality. An interesting story, yes. But it is delivered based on false advertising. As a neuroscience student, I was hoping for empirical data and perhaps something more than a superficial glance over the scientific mysteries of religious practice. If you are interested in a scientist's personal journey to a reconciliation of science and religion, by all means, check this book out. For anyone interested in this subject as it applies to more than only one man's plight, forget it. What it comes down to is misleading advertising."
2,"The result of an attempt at solid logic is ""The God Part of the Brain"".","In researching evidence of a physical connection to spirituality, I was thrilled to find this book. Mr. Alper states that he spent years delving into science's proven answers to the origins and intricacies of existence as we know it. I am not a scientist, but I believe that if one finds one plausible explanation for anything -- and stops searching -- it is akin to believing in a flat earth, thunder gods, or magic beans. For his sake, I hope Mr. Alper has resumed his search since the publication of his work."
1,Pseudo-scientific half-baked nonsense,"I've bought books which I've been disappointed by, but this is the only book I've ever been so disappointed by that I've returned it. If you're looking for something both scientifically and religiously informed, there are a number of great books out there, but this one is neither. The author openly admits his drug use which I don't think automatically discredits him, but it's hard to believe he wasn't heavily under the influence when he wrote this."
4,Good book.,It is more secular but explains what I needed to know about prayer and the brain. Very useful for my study.
5,"A remarkable look at the physiological basis of religion,","Mr. Alper has written an extremely readable comprehehsive analysis of the physiological basis of religiosity. This work is comparable to Freud's ""Future of an Illusion"" in its contribution to the continuing maturation of the human mind. I am using ""The God Part of the Brain"" in a ""Sociology of Religion"" course at New Jersey City University with remarkable results."
1,USELESS WANDERING,"Wasted time and money purchasing this book. One sentence summarizes it: ""God is a concept created by our brain, and therefore has no external reality."" His credentials include taking anti-depressants, using LSD, and wandering in search of truth. I am not arguing with or for him, but only stating that he would have failed any of the courses I teach at the university, including Philosophy of Science.Do not waste your money! He lacks profundity, depth and direction. I purchased this book based on the editorial reviews. Too bad, they they were paid to talk me into purchasing a badly written, badly organized book."
1,Many Duplicate Reviews. Rank Looks Like Home Cooking.,"If you'll notice, there are numerous 4 and 5 star reviews here which are duplicates. It seems like maybe there are some ""God Fearing"" people out their, maybe the author and his friends, who have tried to skew this ranking up a bit. Maybe that's what you need to do to sell bad science."
1,Bleh,"In the prologue, he indicates the premise of this book was conjured up under the influence of LSD so I entered into it with a bit of skepticism. Ironically, this book accidently achieves to reinforce the concept of intelligent design better than some of the ID books out there!!! He does a decent job of explaining some basic science but nothing revealing. In the end however, he manages to explain the ""how"" (science) but fails at any attempt at the ""why"" (why the hows even exist in the first place - we all know ""how"" the Universe developed but ""why"")? What the hell are we doing here???This read adds fuel to the proverbial fire that science is mearly a curve ball thrown at us by God to challenge our faith. Alper strikes out....In addition, the book is marred with various misspellings and line errors as if it was edited and printed in some underground press operation."
4,Interesting,The book is quite interesting and does a great job of keeping the reader entertained. The author provides many great ideas about the brains functionality in creating a god. Most of the book was scientifically based until the end where the author reveals his opinion on the negative effect of religion in society. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and plan on reading the book again.
2,rather platitudinous,"As a staunch atheist and a person who is very interested in the psychological/scientific implications of religion...believe me when i say that I really wanted to like this book. The editorial aspect is the usual regurgitated jargun, and I have to say that I was very disappointed by the lack of cold, hard scientific research. If the concept of this book interests you then you should pick of any number of books from Richard Dawkins, who is a much better writer and backs up every sentence that he types with scientific findings."
5,Wow!,"I just finished Low Red Moon, and all I have to say is wow! I thoroughly enjoyed Silk, and thought that this one was even better. Kiernan's command of the English language and her skill in description are amazing. I'm not sure what the writing process was like, but I can say how I felt about the reading of this book. It's like a fever dream, and there's always something coming up around the bend. With Kiernan's books, I find myself itching to read the whole thing all at once. I can't wait to see what the next work holds."
2,Ever Heard of Roger Corman?,"""Low Red Moon"" includes some wonderful characters; well-defined, thought out, and at times, very sympathetic. However, the plot is beyond convoluted. I was especially disappointed by the ending. Its head on collision with my memories of H.P Lovecraft drove me to re-watch the awful interpretation of ""The Dunwich Horror,"" produced by Roger Corman in 1970. The ending of ""Low Red Moon"" was so similar (albeit, minus the Hounds) that I almost threw the book across the room. It's one thing to build on another author's work but an altogether different thing to use the same plot, ideas, and very world of another author. Bitter disappointment from a writer who can actually write."
1,The American Child,"I did not like this book at all. In fact, I did not even finish reading it. I was very disappointed in it. I have raised four daughter, have numerous grandchildren and have never heard any of them use the stilted language that she uses in this book. Unreal.Mary Pichette"
3,Wish there were more than three shows,"The video quality of the shows is very good. Unfortunately they decided to only present three shows. For someone just wanting a brief viewing of the original bozo shows it is fine. The ""new 3-D"" gimmicky animated creatures that pop up during the live bozo episodes are a definite annoying distraction, and perhaps a way to further label or protect the content."
4,Great morning CD!,"We listen to this almost every morning as we eat breakfast. It is happy, and uplifting, and fun. Our son has autism, so we listen to things over and over, and this is CD we do not get tired of."
5,Creativity in Software dichotomies,"This book really looks at software creativity from a number of dichotomies - Ancient Greek (bring your own hammer) v. Rome (Let's build this together), Discipline v. Flexible, Formal v. Heuristics, extrinsic v. intrinsic motivations, science v. art and a number of others. These topics are all addressed in a series of very easy to read essays that takes the reader through the journey of determining what is best.I found this a very good read and one that I will ponder for sometime."
4,in cold blood,"Excellant photography, very high quality production. Strong evolutionary viewpoint and various other assumptions (time spans, family tree lingages) make me want to debate. Overall, very nice."
5,Terrific value and beautiful films,"I wish David Attenborough could continue to produce more series like this. There is a terrific combination of great cinematography and discovery of new things in this series. My favorite parts deal with the lizards, but all are very well done. Several years ago, PBS/NATURE produced a four part series on the Reptiles. There is no comparison between that series and this one, which is really first rate!"
1,will not play !!!!,ad says its coded for the u.s. it will not play on u.s. players . faults advertising . what a shame.
2,It's was fun......eh,"Always a big fan of the Celebrity Deathmatch T.V. show, and don't get me wrong, the game was fun but after about 30 mins it does get a little boring but none the less it is entertaining."
5,A hillarious game,"I honestly cannot see how this game is treated so poorly, I find this game to be both fun and hilarious. me and my friends play the vs mode on this game a lot and fight outcomes can be funny as heck especially Marilyn Manson's ""portal to hell"" finisher. my one gripe about this game is that the unlockable characters aren't worth it, but otherwise the character selection is great. my personal favorites are Marilyn Manson, Anna Nicole Smith, and Ron Jeremy. So yeah, this game is only like 2 bucks, so if you have a ps2 or compatible ps3 (like me) I highly recommend this game."
3,"Good, But Not Great","It's ok. Could've done better. It's cool you can creat your own celebrity, but it sucks you can't have your custom celebs fight each other. That's one area that could have used some improvement. Other than that, it's not too bad of a game. I certainly had a great laugh having Marylin Manson & my custom celebrities kill all five members on N'sync!"
2,Not worth it,"This game isn't worth the price...actually it's not even worth if it was given free to you...the characters are a shame....the choice is very restringed (not many character AT ALL). you finish the game (in episode mode) in like 30 minutes or less (only 6 episodes, 3 fights each, the same people fighting on all the episodes since there aren't different characters!!!!). The game is boring and lame, too short, and the locked characters are a joke (no celebrities). Fans will be disapointed, casual players will be disapointed, it doesn't do justice to the tv program...beside the referi and the hosts, it's not even about the program....I'm so disapointed...don't waste your money on this game unless you just want to collect i and say "" I own celebrity death match's game even if it's an awful game"" which is the only thing I can do with it now. The grafics are good though, and some of the attacks and "" fatalities"" are pretty cool....but it's still not worth the bother"
1,"not much to it, but fun","Not the best game in the world. But if you liked the show, you will get a kick out of the game."
2,dont waste your money,"this game is okay in the begining, the graphics do not have to be good because it is just clay, but the rings you get suck and this game's 'episodes' are sooo easy to beat, i finished the game in less than an hour. It does not feature any of the celebrities of today besides maybe *Nsync but their 15 minutes of fame is up too. half of the characters is just monsters you win as you pass the episodes, i would expect to get more celebs. this game has okay replay value. The thing I did not like the most is you could not pick a specific move, for each button it had several moves that it could do, and sometimes you ran out of that move for a while and that made me mad.. chose for yourself but i wouldn't waste my money if i was you, i am gonna trade mine in tomarrow"
2,BUYER BEWARE,"I am still smiling, thinking about how lame this game is. I rented it @ 9pm saturday, played a dozen rounds with my girlfriend and had the game ""beat"" by 11pm! 2 hours! In fact, beating the game can be done with the circle button only in 20 minutes. Man would I feel stupid if I bought this. By the way, sorry if you bought this."
1,Stick To the Show,"This game is a renter only, ONLY if you have rented a good game to go with it. It should have come out years ago and then it might have been funny. The characters are dated, the dialogue is what you have heard from the show and the game play is controlled by the game. After you play each character once, the fun is gone. Just rent DON'T Buy."
3,Hilarious Game but not good value for the money.,"For those of you who don't know... you and another player (or CPU) can wrestle celebritys against each other. Each of the celebritys has different moves that fit with that celebrity's character (ex. Carrot Top ""dials down the center"" when he punches.) The goal is to kill your celebrity opponent.The moves on this game are SOOOOO funny, but do sort of get old quick. The unlockables are too easy and boring (I was hoping for Howard Stern). Overall the game is is not the best value since you could really beat it in one sitting.**It is good to whip out this game for company who havent seen it though**"
1,Just plain bad.,"This would have to rate as one of the worst games I've ever purchased. I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased it.A bit like the TV series which the game is based on, the concept is initially funny but wears off very quickly. I think that I played for somewhere between 30 minutes and an hour, that's it. The game-play is very basic and each player has limited moves. Very disappointing.Parents be warned that there is some Mature content in this game. Each character has a couple of special moves and hopefully you can work out for yourself the special moves of characters like or Anna Nicole Smith and Ron Jeremy (porn star)."
4,The best development platform available,"Codewarrior provides an excellent deveopment platform for creating palm applications. The form designer is excellent and easy to use. Codewarrior does have it's quirks however. For one, it looks a bit funny (it was ported from the Mac version), so the look and feel doesn't quite match up with windows. Ocassionally while debugging with the Palm Emulator, you'll have to restart the IDE. These shortcomings are few, and are nothing that restricts development. Other IDE's try to circumvent the Palm API's (in C) to make development ""easier"". It's only a matter of time until you run into something that simply can't be done, and you return to codewarrior. The debugger is robust and allows for stepping, breakpoints, etc. The only reason I gave it 4 vs 5 stars is b/c of it's minor quirks."
4,Great game... but not much of an improvement,"Basically the same as winning eleven 9. Still beats FIFA though. Gameplay is far superior and it just feels more involved and alive. FIFA does look prettier, but player movement is very unrealistic. Movement is much more fluid and smooth in winning eleven. FIFA looked like a bunch of ants spazzing out on the screen. What they need to do is work on graphics as well as player movement (as stated in some previous posts above). Overall, this is still a great game in the Winning Eleven series."
5,very satisfied,"I had an LP of this when it first came out.I waited a long time (years) for this item to become available on CD, and so glad it finally did. Thank You, Phyl"
3,Mainly Tesimonials and Anecdotes,"I bought this as a supplement to a course I am taking. It is chiefly a collection of anecdotal testimonials of personal healings brought about by practicing Zhineng Qigong. The thing is you probably would not read it unless you are already somewhat of a believer in qigong. So it is mostly preaching to the choir. The instructional part is weak compared to Yuantong Liu's book, which gives much more information about the system itself."
3,The 101 Miracles Cassette Tape,I was dissappointed to receive a cassette tape instead of the book.It's a bit difficult to find cassette players today.
2,Beware of Price,"One must have caution when reading an Alfred Price book. Some of them are great, some of them are junkie. This one here belongs to the second category!"
3,Not very good,"My son received this book for Christmas and there were puzzles that were clearly poorly edited and proofread. For example: on one puzzle called "" A Puzzling Proverb"", a line reads: ""If a comma is used in a contraction, circle T, if not, circle N."" The answer key has T as the answer, and the puzzle only works with T. However, the correct answer is N! A comma IS NOT used in a contraction, an apostrophe is used. Yikes!"
5,better than anything else in the market,"I have used clinique, and clean and clear ones. None of them really worked. This product is way too much better than those."
5,Really nice hat,"Good hat, seems to be made well. I have a big head, wear the biggest size available, and also appreciate that it's a deep hat and doesn't feel like it's going to pop off of my head. I wear mine a lot, it's getting a bit dirty so I'm back on to by another. Really great deal for the price (under 11 currently)."
3,Not the same movie I remember,This must be a rated version compared to the movie I saw on Cinemax or Showtime years ago. Everything was edited and the movie was shorter. Kind of a let down.
5,Meat pounder,This is a very beautiful and well designed product. The quality is great. I love it and recommand to everyone who needs this product.
5,Perfect for the job,"MIU 3600 meat pounder: perfect size, weight and balance with no sharp edges; and no place for bacteria to hide. I'm thoroughly pleased with this product."
2,"Unfortunetaly, Faulted","Who could resist 2 excellent guitarists? When they work together the music soars. Unfortunately, Miroslav Vitous gets in the way. He tries to play the same as the guitars but using his base as a violin (at best). Had he stuck to that, especially on ""Rene's Theme"" great things would have happened. He ruined this album for me. Billy Cobham was excellent."
4,Red herrings in and without the Foregate,"The mystery is a bit trite and too neatly wrapped up at the end, but this remains a good read because of Peter's strong characters and setting and great metaphysical questioning."
3,"Personally, I wasn't as impressed","While I know people who have really loved this book, it just wasn't a satisfying read for me. It felt like someone had all these funny stories about what had happened to them, and decided to turn them into a book, embellishing here and there. To me, the plot seemed like an afterthought, a way to string the anecdotes together, rather than the foundation. There definitely were some really funny parts, so it wasn't a worthless read, but I do regret paying full price for the book."
2,This Book Blows,This book is way too unrealistic. Very dry at places and the humor was just nonexistent. I'm giving this 2 stars because i normally like this author.
2,"Readable, but disappointing",Trade PB/I've read Maverick's futuristic fantasy & fantasy books and I really enjoyed most of them. This one did not have any guts to it. There was no real plot: somewhat competent woman is jilted and joins her two laid-off friends to an adventure to the Antarctic where she loses all her backbone. She doesn't really grow as a person; her friends do. Her exploits and mistakes would have gotten her thrown off the continent.
3,"A Silly, Fluffy Read","Adventures Of An Ice Princess should bear the subtitle ""A Fairy Tale."" I've certainly never known people like Clarissa, Kate and Delilah in real life, and many of the situations they get into seem farfetched. And the description of these three friends bringing frivolous clothing and copies of Cosmo while on a tight weight allowance for baggage doesn't ring true, either.While this story is on the silly side, it IS amusing reading. I give Liz Maverick credit for not going the traditional ""chick lit"" route at the end, which would be to have all three girls walking off into a glorious Antarctican sunset with their Mr. Rights. The setting is also a plus to those of us who would love to visit Antarctica for real, even if we have to leave our designer boots and sunglasses at home."
5,Neutral spoon or scoop,"It took me some time to find a neutral soup spoon. I have wedding china from my mother, traditional white Athena, which I have to blend into my decor, which is a lot of chunky bricks and raw leather, with eastern influence from zen buddhism. The spoons are sturdy and a breeze to hand wash. Porcelain is great to work with plant medicines, sprouts, and infusions. No metal or porous materials to gamble on purity."
3,Expectations not met,"Considering the build-up, months of video clips and fascinating subject matter, I expected more of a spiritual treasure. This film is basically a travelogue which skims the surface of Orthodox practice. There is more emphasis on Orthodox monasticism and monasteries, with an occasional blip about the practice of the Jesus Prayer. I have seen more satisfying interviews with Orthodox monastics about the Jesus Prayer on YouTube than I find in this film. Save yourself the purchase price and download it from iTunes for $4.99. Interesting. Should have given more substance, less fluff."
1,POOR,"Plain and simple, this music sucks. If you want music like this, save your money and wait until you go to trim that big hair at SUPERCUTS. You'll hear it there. I don't anticipate them playing Coltrane any time soon.I do get a good haircut there, though. I just bring an Ipod."
1,bad quality,the cover i recieved is bad quality and there is no brand label or anything wroted on the cover to show the brand mark(box wave)and thank you
3,doesnt fit great,"I like the circle design but its not the greatest fit. It sticks up on the top and the right bottom corner on the back. Like the other review said, the case is made a little too small for the phone. The case does protect the phone and the design is cool but im disappointed in the fit."
4,Great quality book,"I agree with Suzanne's review of this book. I also purchased this for my son, and he really enjoys it. Really, really well made with very thick pages. Multiple textures and colorful illustrations. My only complaint would be that the text is a bit boring... ""this big truck has a shiny red door""... ""and this big truck has bumpy wheels"".. (etc) Otherwise, I would give it 5 stars.Really good value for the price though.*** Other REALLY good touchy feely books are ""Dinosaurs"" and ""Mermaids"". (also by Usborne - Fiona Watt/Rachel Wells)"
4,My son does not like this as much as others in the series,"I own about a dozen books in the ""touchy feely"" series. My son does not like this one as much as the ""That's Not My..."" books. Maybe it has something to do with the tone of my voice or something when I read them to him. He will let me read a page or two and then want to go grab another book.Rather than buying this one I would go with (his two favorites):""That's Not My Puppy"" Or ""That's Not My Car"""
1,very cheap junk!,"For the price I was not really expecting much. But from the picture I thought it may make a good display item for the cop in my family. I WAS WRONG! It looks like something from a toy store that you would pay about $2.00 for. Whats more, it got here (somewhat timely) and didn't run.Save your money and time, this is not even cheap toy quality. In fact, if it were free it is not worth the cost of shipping and handling!"
4,Solid game for kids and adults,"This is a pretty fun 2-player game. Hobby gamers won't have any trouble with it, although kids who are only used to traditional games like Candyland or Go Fish may need a little adult help to learn it. It includes basic and advanced rules, so you can try the simple version (which leaves out some of the cards) first. Note that gameplay is nearly identical toClash of the Lightsabers Star Wars Card Game. The main difference (aside from the theme and artwork) is that this game doesn't include pewter miniatures for keeping score -- you just flip scoring cards to track that. Also, this game uses illustrations while the Star Wars game had movie stills on the cards. On the plus side, this game will fit in your pocket.I was able to play this with my preschooler (who plays a lot of games and is into anything Transformers) by taking out all the cards with text on them and just playing with the number cards. I'll add in the others once he can read them."
2,Transformer Card Game,"I purchased this card game about 2 years ago for my 6 year old grandson.... In fairness, I never got around to contacting the seller, so problem may have been resolved if I had. However...cards were durable, pretty, and nice as a collectible, but instructions didn't make sense to me. We tried and tried but couldn't figure out how to play the card games. Maybe it was just me."
2,Better for older childen.,"I bought this set of cards for my oldest child (almost 7), thinking it would give him an opportunity to learn more about Transformers, counting, game rules, numbers, etc. But the rules of the game were so complex, even my husband gave up and just played the simplest version with him. They played once and he hasn't even asked to play it again. Maybe when he's older and can understand what the game is asking."
1,None,This is the worst of cookbooks. There is table of contents but no index. Not worth the money I spent.
2,An Interesting Disappointment,"Interesting, experimental novel by one of my favorite ""This American Life"" essayists. Folks familiar with that show will recognize the storytelling style: three- or four-sentence paragraph/chapters, each presenting a new idea, are bounced off each other in very rapid succession. The effect is sometimes ironic, sometimes not. Unfortunately, this device may be better suited to radio than it is to the page, and while there are some powerful moments the book comes off as more of a gimmicky exercise than anything else. The relentless cleverness (although the writing isn't terribly funny) make the book seem pretty far removed from actual human experience. It's also bogged down by an undergraduate sensibility about sex, and by a lot of odd metaphors that don't go anywhere. I can imagine this style being successfully applied to the novel form, but I don't think Goldstein's done it here."
2,Disappointing,"Anybody who's ever heard this author on This American Life would have high hopes for any novel he writes, but unfortunately Lenny Bruce is Dead just doesn't live up to his potential.However, I recently read his second book, ""Schmelvis"", and it's extraordinary. It's not a novel but rather a sort of road trip memoir. It's about a documentary Goldstein worked on about Elvis Presley's Jewish roots (yes, believe it or not, the King was a Hebe) and it is brilliant. He and a film crew, a chassidic jewish Elvis impersonator named Schmelvis and a wacky Rabbi went to Memphis and Israel looking for evidence. Hilarious, touching, fascinating, all at the same time. I'd recommend that Jonathan's fans run, don't walk, and pick up ""Schmelvis"". Much more in the spirit of This American life than Lenny Bruce is dead, although his novel does have its moments so you might want to read that as well."
1,Burn this book,"This book was not funny or interesting. It is sort of like those columns Larry King used to write..... I want a pastrami sandwich,.....isn't the Godfather a great movie,..........I remember when the Yankees won all the time.... This author must have a lot of friends in the writing business, because this waste of time shouldn't get good reviews. Thank you very very mush."
1,Waste of time and money,"If I could give it fewer stars I would. Masturbatory, adolescent stream of consciousness, with absolutely nothing to say. Its only redeeming feature is that it is short."
5,Clever and entertaining,Amazingly clever book. I read it twice and intend to read it again. It says more in what it doesn't say than in what it does. Brilliant.
4,A fun rowdy movie!,"This is a good film. If youi like the way too many times mentioned ""Lock, stock and 2 smoking barrels"", or ""In Bruges"", you'll like this. The witty repartee had me rolling on the floor. The dad was excellent. Cilian Murphy was also very good. I place this a tier below ""Layer Cake"", and I consider that high praise indeed. It's a lot better than recent films like The Bank Job. Get this and be prepare to laugh.And not only, but also, be prepared to be entertained."
4,Perriers Bounty,Good movie with an interesting plot. Although the acting was excellent the characters were not developed enough. The movie moved at a rapid pace which keeps your attention but again almost made it difficult to fully understand the back drop story. All in all well worth watching.
3,"A good read, but left you still needing/wanting something","I read this book recently. I found it was the same old story written by most religious authors. I did not walk away from this book feeling overwhelmed or in awe.I enjoyed the real-life stories he tells within the book, as I thought they made a bigger impression into why things happen the way they tend to do in life.However, towards the end in the discussion section, I was a little drawn away that he offers no suggestions no how to go about locating or seeking the items/defining moments in your life, so as to answer the questions and progress onwards in your faith journey.I felt that this book might be geared more towards those that have already heard God's call versus those that are seeking Him out. Lost sheep would do better reading another book."
5,Great Stuff from the Real Deal,"This is a oollection of great songs and great performances by one of the finest groups of the folk era. Great playing, great singing, great harmonies on covers and on terrific originals such as ""A Lion Named Sam"" and ""I Wish I Were a Babe"". If you like real folk music, you will love this. I strongly recommend buying this album!"
3,"Nice layout, too heavy","I'd like to rate this bag higher, but then I'd have to like it better.It's just too heavy. Empty, it's heavy. Utilize all the nifty pockets and pouches and it's unbearable. The narrow profile means the strap is pulled hard and it really kills the shoulder.The pluses to this bag are the flaps, pouches, pockets and compartments. NIFTY! A place for everything! However that's part of it's downfall, it's too easy to overload, and with it's tare weight above normal - ow.While the canvas is nice and thick, it's also musty and it has a cold, old, warehouse smell to it. Some nice points, some not so nice. Could probably take a lot of rough use and abuse, unfortunately I wanted a light and fast commuter bag; protection and compartments for my stuff, yes, but not at this weight."
4,Cool but heavy,I like this bag a lot but two flaws. 1. Its quite heavy. Not for the small. 2. The clasp for the flap isn't easy to lock. Beside that its great.
4,Great bag,"My boyfriend loves this bag - the only issue we ran into is that there was a magnetic tag in it that kept setting off shoplifting alarms when we were out and about. Make sure you look for it, and take it out before you start using the bag - otherwise, great!"
1,Dreadful,"I bought this book with high hopes. I am fascinated both with science (especially neuroscience) and with spirituality (especially Eastern). This book promised to bring togetehr these two subjects in a novel concordance.Sadly, it doesn't. What we get is a mismash of facts, theory, anecdote, and tradition that has neither the logic of good science nor the passion of moving spirituality. It was almost enough to stop me from taking my Yoga classes at the YMCA. Of the recent spate of science and religion books, this is the worst."
4,Best for those on a budget,"This card is the best bang for the buck. The Geforce2 MX is based on the core of the Geforce2 GTS. The only major difference is that it only has two rendering pipelines versus the four in the GTS and the original Geforce for that matter. But the Geforce2 MX is pretty much as strong of a performer as the original Geforce video cards. Furthermore, with only two rendering pipelines it only consumes half the power of the GeForce2 GTS and one-fourth the power of the original GeForce. That can be quite good for someone who has a lot of peripherals on his or her computer or just has a low power supply. A word of note: adequate power is essential to use the most modern video cards. A 250 Watt power supply on an AGP 2.0 compliant computer is probably the minimum you can get away without having your 3D games lock up on you during intensive game playing. Otherwise, this card will give you all the features that it's more expensive GTS cousin has without breaking your pocketbook."
3,Upgrade Blues,The 3D Prophet is not a prophet at all but just another fake. I say that since it did not live up to the hype. The compatability is limited to only those who have agp 2.0. Those of us who use agp 1.0 are out of luck. The card is not compatible with some of the most popular games. Running Half-Life found that crashes would be a menace. Installation was a snap. The only highlight of this story.
4,Fantastic.,What a great recounting of a career spent trying to get true bad guys off the street. It's no wonder Cea butted heads with the desk jockeys on the force.A must-read for anyone wanting to see what now-Yuppie Brooklyn was like in its former incarnation.
3,Corruption? Yes. Redemption? No.,"Coming from a family of police officers I thought this would shed some light on what isn't said at the dinner table. As a rookie cop, Robert Cea believed in by-the-book policing...until he was assigned to a bombed-out precinct in East Flatbush, New York. Soon enough he's bribing snitches, brutalizing bad guys, and raising eyebrows at IAB. Yes, this story has been done before, but the book reads like a greatest hits compilation of hard-boiled cop moments. Cea retired as the fifth most decorated officer in NYPD history and just sold the movie rights so read this book before they mess it up on the big screen."
3,Kind of boring,"This was a decent read, but I just couldn't really get in to it all that much. It was enjoyable but probably will not be reading it again."
5,Perfect warm weather protection,"I've ridden with this jacket a couple of times now in upper 80 weather, and when you're moving it keeps you cool. The loose mesh and perforated leather lets the air through. I'm sure with the liner in this will be good for cooler days, too. It has excellent shoulder, elbow, side and upper and lower back protection. It's well made and it looks great too. I ordered the 2XL and it fit just as I expected it to. I'm very happy with this Joe Rocket Reactor jacket, and it looks like this jacket is going to last a long time."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"I thought this was a daily affirmation book, but I was mistaken. I also thought it would be geared mostly toward the visual artist, but I was again mistaken."
5,Great training tool,This was an excellent video. It gave me many useful tools in correcting bad behavior in my dogs. It was easy to follow and Dr. Dunbar has a wonderful sense of humor.
3,Dog Aggression: Fighting,"Part lecture, part demonstration, it was interesting. Methods were different than I had seen before."
1,Like a beta version,"I just installed this yesterday and have already uninstalled it becasue it causes major computer problems, including tons of crashes on a three-month old 933 Mhz P3 with 256 MB RAM and plenty of HD space that NEVER crashes with Win 98. Now that I unistalled it, Win 98 is working fine again and relatively error-free. Most of what comes with it is available without the upgrade.It also appears to be a sorts of ""Windows for Dummies"" version. A lot of the control panel options which allow you to make changes are hard to access or gone. The only advantage seems to be that it lists things in the Start Menu in alphebetical order and that it loads faster, when it loads correctly (about 33% of the time)."
2,Yuk,"All I can say is, the computer I had with Windows 95 on it is still running strong at my parents house, whilst this one I bought new with Windows ME on it constantly hangs up and crashes.Thank goodness all the new computers have XP on them now. I can't wait to get one."
1,Avoid This Title!,"Windows ME is basicly a poor attempt by Microsoft to get people to upgrade from Windows 98. This OS works ok on most peoples systems for a while, but about 10 people I know who have this OS, or had this product, moved to another Operating system eventually. It seems to be great the first couple of months you have it, but then starts acting weird, and eventually crashes. I have had windows 98 on a computer for years without having to reload. Probably explains why Micriosoft took it off the market so quickly."
2,ME = Microsoft's Evil,"Awhile back I had purchased an upgrade to ME for my 98se machine, thinking that it would run OK even though everyone that I talked to that knew what they were saying said that it was the worst. I happily installed it, restarted a couple times for my hardware to configure itself, and watched my computer blue screen after about 5 minutes of personalizing my settings. At first I thought it was an id10t error (idiot, haha), so I ignored it, rebooted, and continued to be appalled at the frequent number of crashes and bugs Microsoft loaded this hunk of junk with. Half a day later, 98se was back on my machine and normal as usual. The end."
1,Consider Windows 2000 Pro Instead,"Windows ""Me"" is very unstable and bug ridden. If you have '95 or '98 then you are better off keeping it.However, if you have the money for Windows 2000 Pro, go for that."
1,Problems Galore,I have completed a few Windows upgrades before. This by far was the most difficult to complete. First there were the multiple driver updates I needed as reqirements. Then when I completed the updates and the install I found more problems with Power Management. I am returning this product immediately.
2,New windows Me & Me,"Hello; I thought I would give you a review on this program. It has to go a long way to beat 98, but it is getting there. It has some bugs in it and I am havoing a hard time finding out how to deal with them. I have tried all I know which isn't much, but still not able to get it working the way it should. If you have any ideas and can help would love it. I do like the program but liked my old one better..."
1,The Same,"There is no difference from WinMe form Win98Se, you can just download Media Player and the new IE, and you got Me. All Me is, is a graphical user interface built on Dos without any stable foundation, All it is is a 1985 Graphical Dos Program"
1,From first to worst...,"When I got my new computer from gateway, it came with windows ME. At first, I thought it was better than Windows 98, until I tried to run Microsoft Word 2000. Crash! When ever I try to run any program, 95% of the time it crashes! I had to erase the hard drive and install windows 98!"
4,Using Windows ME,I have an old laptop. I lost my keyword to my other ME disk. Buying a used copy was the easy way out to still use this old laptop for minimal computing.
1,Lasted under 10 hours on my machine...,"Wow! Now this is trash. Bought it at 10 am, and just finished uninstalling it 7 pm the same day! The install was going great, although I did have to uninstall Norton Internet Security before I could continue. After the install, my system froze up at least 30 times. I can verify that the boot sequence is very fast, almost non existent having watched it sooooo many times.Couldn't even get on the internet after I installed it either. Dialed up, verified name and just hung......had to try reinstalling modems, drivers the whole deal.Uninstall went great so far and as you can tell, I'm back online.Windows Me----Windows Must eliminate. Or just wait for the WinMe 5th edition. They should have the bugs worked out by then :)If you had a similar problem with WinMe, let me know if you fixed it."
2,Mediocre at best!,"Me does crash your sytem more often! Not just me, but friends pc's also. It consumes more memory resources. System restore is at times unreliable. Most people I know have went back to Win98 SE or 2000 professional. You be the judge."
1,Good god! Please avoid this product,"If you are tempted to buy this product just back away from the computer. If you feel you will be unable to control yourself then rip out your connection to the internet and do not, I repeat, DO NOT visit any software stores. Windows ME is the fowlest software to be released by Microsoft since it's ill fated release of Windows 3.1. It is highly unstable, and if anything goes wrong you can not tweak it easily. Stick with windows 95 or 98, if you want to upgrade choose Windows 2000, and if you have Windows NT you shouldn't even be thinking of installing Windows ME."
1,This is a piece of garbage,"A waste of money and plasic. The installation was a nightmare. After I finally got the system up and running, I walked away from it for 10 minutes, came back to only find the ""Blue screen of death"" waiting for me. And then periodically, I'll walk away and come back to find the entire system has frozen, mouse and everything. This is all Bull Sh--. Come on Microsoft, we made you the company you are by buying your crap, stop marketing unstable crapware. (Thank god for Linux) If your upgrading from win98 make sure you take out anything that automatically starts up, ie. startup folder, run registry key. Also uninstall any anti-virus software and disable any networking you have for a login. Bottom line is: If it isn't broke, don't fix it."
1,"Stay with 98, until they put out something stable!","I upgraded one of my 95 machines, and the problems started immediately. The system seems to go into a ""let me think about this awhile"" state, that is not explainable. Maybe some of my drivers are wrong, but hey... shouldnt the install find that out???? I had to wipe the HD and install 98, which is performing quite well indeed! The features that this version gives you are not much of an improvement over 98. If you want a more powerful system, NT is alot more stable than this ""attempt"". There is also always Linux :)"
1,Just Say No,"I attempted to load ME as an upgrade to Windows 95 on an older computer, a 200 MHZ Pentium. When the upgrade was complete, Windows ME no longer recognized that I had a CD-ROM and I could not log onto the Internet. Windows ME did not recognize my Network Card, a Linksys Etherfast 10/100 PC Card, and I could not upgrade the driver. Luckily, I could easily uninstall Windows ME and will never again make the mistake of upgrading an operating system. A total waste of money and a piece of software junk."
2,Windows 98 with a few more bugs,"Windows ME is not capable of ever being compared to Windows 2000, not even Windows 98. It is a good upgrade for those of you running Windows 3.0, but if you have Windows for Workgroups v3.11 or above, with the exception of 98 second edition - stick with it... ME is 98 with some bugs taken out, more added into it.Most software does not work with it, if you have an older computer, get NT or 2k, or switch to Linux, you will save yourself a ton of hassle... or just upgrade your PC and use XP."
2,Windows ME is just a filler product,"I believe Microsoft put this operating system out to not be forgotten during the Linux craze and did not offer up any real solutions to it's stability problems. After the upgrade, I found a lot of software and hardware not compatible with the new sytem. So, if I want to use these products I've paid hundreds of dollars for I have to buy ""more compatible stuff""..... I do realize the problems probably lie with the software and hardware manufacturers but Windows ME should have been friendlier with them. Don't buy it and I'm not all too sure about Windows XP. Am I going to have the same problems??? I gave it a two because of it's new multimedia features which I really liked."
1,Not worth the hassle,"Installed it as an upgrade to Windows 98SE, now I have multiple crashes and can't stay on the internet for more than 2 minutes without a reboot unless I use Netscape as the browser. Inlcuded video camera software is suspect at best and tells me my system is too slow ... yeah right.Don't buy it...it ain't worth it. If it wasn't for the fact I have loads of Windows 9x software titles to replace, I would have boguht an Apple !"
1,Great for keeping you up late...,"After you system crashes and you have to reboot. You get many errors, lots of blue screens. And my active desktop seems to hate every program ever, even those by microsoft. I would much rather run 3.11 then Me. Me, many errors, Maniacal Enigma, Must Erase."
1,I wish I had never upgraded to ME,"Upgrading to ME has cost me a fortune in time and money. Upgrading from 95B required me to upgrade many of my applications as they would not run. I even had to upgrade my scanner as the SCSI card was not supported on ME.After all that time and expense, the system is very unstable, keeps eating disk space on the C drive, and my mouse and clock will not work correctly.Avoid ME"
2,Hooking up review,"The book was a grab bag of micellaneous articles which had not been published before. Despite the tease, it had nothing to do with the phenomenon of ""hooking up.:"" The articles on Silicon Valley was interesting (if you live there), but the rest was absolutely unrelated to anything else in the book. And I have read almost all Tom Wolfe has written. This was a disappointment."
3,Like a B-sides collection for Wolfe fans,"I don't claim to have any literary pretensions--afterall I read Maxim, visit CollegeStories.com and watch too much reality TV. But I am a fan of Wolfe--ran out to buy Man in Full and I Am Charlotte Simmons. I'm also a closet science geek.That's why I found his essays on neurosciene and the history of Intel to be particularly fanscinating. His ability to coax a story out of facts, notes, factual notes and notes about facts is amazing.On the other hand, not being a lit head and under the age of 40, I found his version of a liteary dance-off with all of his haters to be less than interesting. And not a little chest beating.I vote yes on checking this out from the library. Bonus: there's little chance of running up late fees."
3,an original,"Tom Wolfe's ""Hooking Up"", written in his usual opinionated style, is in some parts lively and entertaining. It does bog down in places like the long explanation of Wolfe's feud with the New Yorker, which is more interesting to the writer himself than to the general reader.His analysis of the cultural traditions that went into the making of the Silicon Valley mentality, is sharp, deep, and probably accurate.The book includes a long novella which did not engage this reviewer with its theme, characters, or repetitive descriptions.Taken as a whole, Wolfe's book is alternately absorbing in some parts, tedious in others. Three stars."
4,Good,"I enjoyed this. I'd read a lot of the pieces in magazines. The NEW YORKER piece I hadn't, and enjoyed him giving them a proper skewering. The THREE STOOGES piece was a bit much, though. First off, A MAN IN FULL was a very very flawed novel. And the idea that criticism by his contemporaries was soley jealousy is self-serving. The other bizarre thing about that piece, is that Tom Wolfe goes on and on and on and on about how old Mailer, Updike and Irving are, NEVER MIND THAT TOM WOLFE IS IN THEIR SAME AGE GROUP. Wolfe is, in fact, a lot older than Irving. So who is he to knock Irving for his age? Very hypoctrical. But I love Tom Wolfe, and so I do recommend this book, with that one reservation."
4,some brilliant parts,"The essay ""Two Young Men Who Went West"" is worth the price of the book. This captures the essential spirit of Silicon Valley better than just about anything written about the subject."
2,Don't Bother,In general I love Tom Wolfe's work especially Man in Full. Quite frankly I found this volume of old essays dull. The essay on the founding of HP was interesting. Much of the rest of the book appeared to be an attempt to make himself feel more important by taking shots at any who criticize him... see My Three Stooges. Ambush at Fort Bragg would be more interesting if I could determine his point of attack. Did he attack the media or the homophobic soldiers? The last portion of the book about his clash with the New Yorker would be a lot more interesting if I was 20 years older and lived in or cared about NYC. I couldn't finish this book and that has only happened one other time. Maybe I'm just not as smart as Mr. Wolfe would require I be to read this book. Don't bother.
3,Re-hashed Wolfe,"13 of the 14 short stories contained in ""Hooking Up"" have been previously published, making this collection for novice Wolfe readers a must. ""Ambush at Fort Bragg"" is magnificent. But the only new essay in the collection reads flat, and is not in the league of ""The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test,"" and ""Bonfire of the Vanities."""
2,"Cooking Up, a Potboiler","This book is seriously marred by Wolfe's complete lack of understanding of the Internet. He has no grasp of its cultural impact and substitutes sneers for his usual insight (Ok, it's usually snarky insight, but still...)The Fort Bragg piece is also weak. It reminds me of a Made for TV movie. Media opportunism isn't exactly a newsflash."
3,an entertaining romp through 30 years of Wolfe,"I agree with the majority of reviewers who point out the uneveness of this collection. Part of me kept asking, ""And why NOW are we reading some of these old essays?"" But, since I love Wolfe's writing, I could forgive him some moments of indulgence. I liked the Bragg piece and the New Yorker bits and the hooking up essay, but some of the other ones are actually dull in parts -- except for the writing I guess you'd say. When Wolfe is at his best, he can rip others to shreds and keep that grin on his face. At his low point, he fails to stimulate much interest in his current rant. I happen to think he excels at pop culture. I wanted more ""hooking up"" essays with his trenchant observations about our culture. Instead, we get more of a random selection of good essays that jump all over the map."
4,Intellectual Entertainment,"I love Tom Wolfe's novels and books yet I had always heard he was a ""conservative"" but never knew why. His books didn't ever strike me as conservative or liberal but equally critical of both. This books is a collection of articles that will explain why he is called a conservative. Yet you will also see why he is an intellectual (something he would hate being called because he is critical of them).However, whatever your philophy, you'll find find something to agree with and much to contemplate. Also, Wolfe has the ability of taking an ""intellectual"" arguement (even if it is biased) and making it something easy (even fun) to read... and this is no mean feat. The reader for this tame is also fantastic.My only critisism with the book is that it is a little too egocentric and biased for me to take on regularly particularly when he uses selective logic to favor his views."
5,Very good information,"I have only read portions of the book at this point but plan to read all of it. I am completly ignorant of harness driving but recently purchased a miniature horse that I plan to finish in carting. This book has been an excellant resource. It is very detailed, but easy to understand. It mentions things to keep in mind that might not be obvious (like if you're new to harness or your horse is, you should have a bucking strap on your harness to save you a lot of frustration). I also like her approach to working with the horse - it is definately working WITH the horse and not BREAKING the horse. I have not read any other driving books yet to compare, but I am happy that I started with this one."
4,Better Then I Thought,I thought Scott Cannon (Danny Willaims on Hawwia 5-0)did an amazing job in this movie. Sure at times it was sad but still very good. It was nice to see him as a lead actor in a movie and not just as a supporting cast. I bought this movie and Im so happy I did. I would watch it again. It was also good seeing Ericka Chirisetein (Parenthood)in something new. If you like Scott Cannon as much as me I think you would enjoy this movie.
1,DVD would not play on my DVD player.,"This DVD would not play on my DVD player, Caused the whole system to lock up. Costs more to ship it back than the DVD is worth."
1,movie guy,this is easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen - about a tough guy who is about 5 foot 4 - no plot ;no drama - yuchhh - stay away ;far far away from this turkey
2,Cliches,"Saw this on demand - read a couple of favorable reviews on imdb but I thought this was a terrible movie - cliched characters, dialogue and plot. Just my two cents."
5,So good that we bought two!,This book is amazing. My husband had a copy and we bought another one for a gift. It's wonderful for anyone who loves history. So many interesting facts and great photographs. It is the best book on Barnum we have ever found.
5,Amazed and facinated at the same time,This book was truly amazing. It covers a life span of this amazing man that brought so much to so many and still continues. It lives up to the title and through out the book the author injected noted facts about this amazing man and historical events. Not to pass up for a great quick informative read.
5,Big Show Man get a Big Book,This is a really GREAT book. Lot of pictures - I like that. This book could be enjoyed by anyone I think. It sits on my coffee table and it works really good - people come to my house - see it - pick it up - and then I don't have to talk to them for about 30 minutes.
3,AVOID THE DIRT ROADS,"Pretty standard stuff. A group of young good lookin girls and guys, get lost in the hills. As usual, they come across a group of monster types who have been in-breeding. These guys are sub-human and its not explained why in-breeding increased thier strengh and hearing so much. Bullets and axes dont completly stop them either. Eliza(Faith the vampire slayer) runs away gets caught and looks darn good doin it. Ending is a bad, but the flick is o.k. just not to original."
5,Frightened the hell out of me!,"Its not often horror films frighten me, they are generally silly and unbelievable, and whilst they may make me jump from time to time, they don't often build suspense...UNLIKE this film.This genuinely scared the pants off me!There is nothing original about the film; its a simple horror, kind of a mix between 'Deliverance' and the 'Chainsaw Massacre' and even the 'Hills Have Eyes', but thew director has very skillfully created a really scary film.I saw it at the cinema with 3 of my friends. After 20 minutes we all considered leaving the cinema as we were SO uncomfortably scared, but stayed because of the quality of the film.I recently watched the DVD, thinking the film would have losts its edge now that I'd seen it... I was wrong. JUST as scary.This is a testement to the Director and cast who all do a great job. The lead actress, (Eliza Dushku) she was excellent.As for the dvd extras - good mini documentaries, well produced, and some worthy deleted scenes."
5,Horror,"She played a reaaly good part in this movie, shes not quite your marilyn monroe or sharon tate however she has potential Janet Leigh"
3,"Descent slasher, but less than original","It was an ok slasher film. The plot leaves a little something to be desired and at times is just sort of slow and repetitive. It was so closely related to Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes that it didn't have a great deal of originality.The production values were good, the acting was slightly better than the average teen-scream, the special effects and makeup didn't really fail either.Overall, descent, but if you're really looking for something you haven't seen before, take a pass. If you like typical campy horror, teen-scream slasher films, it's worth the rental."
2,"Sad, Boring, and Pathetic. 1.5 Stars.","The gore is the best part. This movie is one cliche afetr the other, but that's what the director wanted. There are some inovated kills in this, that will keep gore fans entertained. Plot? You already know it. Teens go into woods, smoke have sex, get slaughtered by a family of imbreed cannabals. Believe me that IS the plot. No character development, no suspense, no scares, but the gore is great. My personal favorites are the arrow in the eye and decaptitation of the girl in the tree. Other than that, this is going to put you sleep."
2,Pretty Pathetic,"I was hyped for this flick because I like Deliverance.After I seen this movie I realized Wrong Turn wasn'tmuch like it at all. Deliverance was about 4 city boysgoing to the woods and two of them getting mentallytortured and having to coverup the murders of the twohicks they killed. This movie is a Texas Chainsaw Mass-acre rip-off. It's just a stop and go gore fest withlame looking hick folk. Come on! These guys don't evenlook human! They look like some monster trolls or something like that.It's just boring and uninteresting. There was one scenethat I really liked with an axe and a tree. Don't wantto give it all away. Other than that, the movie was justa bore. I expected more from a movie that was supposedto be out of the Deliverance mold."
2,wrong turn indeed by anthony m jones,"Antoher movie about canibles what a waste of time, well look Im gonna make it plain and simple,Im gonna make a list of things that sucked about the movie and things that really sucked about this movie.list of things that sucked;1;The cannibles are so ugly and its like they're envinceble.2;The cheesy effects for the movie were horrific.3;The acting was really bad.list of things that really sucked;1;The predictible ending 2;The fact I didnt get scared nor jump during the entire movie and 3;The fact that ive seen the same type of movie a million times before.Note; the only reason I didnt give it a 1 star rating is because I dont want to be to hard on the barely suspenseful plot.Sorry the producers made a wrong turn by making this movie.By the way if your half way interestd in this movie i'll at least suggest you renting it first."
3,That Ain't WVA!,"Sorry folks, but anyone from the northeast can easily tell that this film was not shot anywhere near WVA! Come on; the shots of the vast wilderness are darn near flat! Trust me kids, WVA ain't flat! Its a shame really since WVA has some of the best mountain scenery in the world. Oh well, I guess they were able to save a few bucks by shooting this stinker in Canada."
2,Another Mediocre Mass Market Horror Film,"This one is a disappointment. I was looking forward to a modern variation on the atypical ""teens lost in the woods"" film popularized in the 1970s. Instead, the film turned out to be another ""assembly line"" horror film consistant with much of what Hollywood is turning out these days with regard to horror films. The acting is competent, the story is a standard cookie-cutter trek through the woods with a bunch of terrorized kids. Nothing original here -- and no surprises, although the make-up by Stan Winston is noteworthy. I wouldn't recommend this as anything more, than probably a rental on a night when there isn't anything better on the tube."
2,Wrong purchase,This one sucked. Apart from a couple of cool deaths it was just stupid. I prefer HILLS HAVE EYES to this for in-bred freaky terror. Jeremy Sisto is good in this but you should watch MAY for his best horror film.It was competently made but left me feeling unsatisfied.Strictly a rental
2,Wrongheaded,"Wrong Turn starts off rather promising. The characters get introduced; there is dialogue that sounds natural and some quite funny jokes. Of course, one shouldn't expect too much from a horror movie...Anyway, after about half an hour the film makes a wrong turn and never seems to get back on track. The film makers obviously confuse gory and disgusting with scary, and that turns every climax into an anti-climax. Instead of going ""uh, this is scary"", you go ""yikes!"" and that's quite a different thing. All the suspense that is built up goes wasted, and that's too bad.Still, some things are quite ok in this film (at least by horror standards) such as... well some of the dialogue. I guess it might as well have gotten one star.From the beginning the viewer gets some clues about mutants and inbred people in the woods. But we don't get to know what they do to people. Do you want to know?"
2,One of 2003's worst.,"Eliza Dushku is gorgeous, let's just get that out of the way because that is the only reason to see this movie.The plot of this movie is one we've seen time and time again. Teenagers make a ""wrong turn"" and end up lost or stranded in a dangerous place. But what's the scary thing about this movie? Well, imbread West Virginians of course. Seriously, couldn't we think up of a more frightening killer than imbread West Virginians? It's pretty cheesy. Even though the movie does have some tense moments and a few ""pop out and scare yous"", it still fails to earn your money.Rent it."
3,Not as bad as it looks,Wrong turn is your average horror movie. Set in West Virginia it provides a lot of gore and blood as well as a lot of cleavage. It seems that the 2 points the movie wants to prove is the amount of blood and guts as well as the amount if cleavage shots. If you like gory movies you&#65533;ll love this. I jumped in a few parts. Its your regular summer movie fun. Not the best movie if you come from WV since the redneck jokes of WV are a lot
5,best horror flick of 2003,This movie actually scared me unlike those [other] teen horror flicks which don't have any good stroy lines only the same [stuff] over and over.But not this movie it provides you with lots of suspense blood and more blood the acting is really good you must go see this movie if you are looking for a really good scare
4,Very weird movie.,"I give this 4 stars. But it was a very strange and weird movie. The mutants were so freaky looking. I think the special effects guy should get major kudos.I would give this 3, but the weirdness and creepiness of the movie made it worth the 2 hours to me.I recommend this highly.MC White said: Hinky!"
4,Get your banjo...,"This movie was absolutely terrifying. I'm sure it'll run through my mind when I drive through some of those back-woods places. The characters were grotesque and I don't think I'll *ever* watch this movie again, but it served its purpose. I don't know whether it was a cold room or getting the bejesus scared out of me, but i shivered quite a bit."
2,They got this all wrong...,"The thing about `Wrong Turn' is that it tries so hard to be something else that it forgets to create its own identity. Instead, it remains a mediocre copy of better films that came before it. The idea of mutated woodsmen waiting to feast on scared little teenagers isn't anything new, and sadly nothing about `Wrong Turn' tries to do anything new. We have hot young things getting their freak on and then getting butchered by a scary group of grotesque people who pick them off one by one. Like many others have noted, films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes, even the remakes, are far more effective in this sub-genre. If you are into films that regurgitate themes and scenes from better films then by all means, dig in, but if you want something with its own pulse and its own vision then stay away from this. If you want to see Eliza Dushku run through the woods in a tight white tank, then watch this movie immediately."
4,UGLY...,"Yes, there are a lot of copycat elements in this film, a true original is rare.The most jarring sequence is in the beginning montage, those photographs of the product of second and third generation inbreeding, probably more. Although the characters are really actors, I heard somewhere that those photos were real; the close-ups of the faces, that is.The mountain men didn't have the comic relief of the Sawyer family from TCM, but that makes it all the more hard-hitting. These guys have no socialization, they are feral, ugly, and imposing.The victims are just regular people, with regular lives, and as with any movie of this type, it's hard to watch them meet such a grisly end. And it's all for the survival of these mountain men. Such people probably are out there, somewhere."
3,A HEART-THUMPING FRIGHT FLICK THAT COULD'VE BEEN EXCELLENT..,"For a fairly unknown cast and troupe, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this film's production. It clearly goes for a suspenseful horror thriller crown, and gets very, very close. The riveting pace never lets up from scene 1, and the action is grisly. Several scenes in the first quarter of the movie are so brilliantly done you'll be squirming in your private little sweat puddle.The film's undoing comes, though, from the stark unoriginality of its characters or material, only exacerbated exponentially by the high-school drama-queen variety of pseudo-sentimentality produced by its idiotic lead actress, who is quite gratingly among the only 2 protagonists that survive against impossible odds.I can be certain that somewhere in here was a fabulous movie groping to come out, but as it were, Wrong Turn doesn't let it. Decent rental though if you're into slasher flicks."
1,Waste of money,"This movie doesn't even need a review. It is very unoriginal,predictable, cheezy,etc. I know a good horror/slasher movie and this is not it. If your interested in inbreeding or cannibalism or a movie about sick and twisted rural lifestyle, check out a movie like ""Deliverance"" or ""The(original)Texas chainsaw massacre"", these are well worth the time. I saw this movie at a party and even in the state of mind we all were in, attention was lost quickly from this movie and many commments were made about how horrible this movie is as well as several laughs."
1,Lost in the wood,"A by-the-numbers contribution to the hot 20-somethings-in-peril in-redneck-country genre.Two couples and spare girl Jessie (Eliza Dushku) on the way to confront the latter's errant boyfriend take the wrong turn of the title and get knocked off the road by a barbed wire boobytrap. Soon after, lone wolf medical student Chris (Desmond Harrington) accidentally smacks into the back of their 4x4.From then on they start to get picked off in turn by the locals, who have a taste for city-boy (and girl) flesh. The whole thing chugs along amiably enough in its way before guttering out in a messy, somewhat suspense-free finale. Lead man Harrington is so wooden it's hard to imagine he'd provide much of nutritional value to the cannibal countryfolk in pursuit."
4,"ONE WRONG TURN , ONE NASTY MOVIE!!","see, these are the reasons you stay away from the woods, the mountains, the backwood town, places you don't know where the hell they're going. one wrong turn might just be one dead end. a young hot group of people, inbred monsters, missing hikers, and nowhere near civilization can make for a very interesting horror flick. not to mention it hits close to reality. you know there's just some kind of stuff like this in the world somewhere. this group gets stranded, they go out to find some help, instead they find a few cannibals. now they have to run for their lives, all of them not making it of course. good story, nice thrills, good actors. eliza dushku, she's a bad girl in this flick. i give her respect, and desmond harrington, man that boy does his thing here. my hero. he manages to keep the light on him. and jeremy sisto, no i didn't like his ending. his acting was good, as always, but he didn't have to go out like that. other than that, enjoyed it."
5,Inbred Mutant Hillbilly cannibals rock,"""Wrong Turn"" Is one of the most enjoyable recent horror movies I have seen.Being a huge 70's and 80's slasher fan I crave new movies that live up to my expectations.I hear people complain we have seen this before!!! Blah blah blah..UM, No we haven't .Slasher/Horror lovers you know good and well that there are certain formulas that work and some that don't ,this one does!!!Inbred mutant cannibals ? love it .Have there been other movies with a similar plot ? Yes. So What I loved them as well,stop complaining it isn't rocket science it's a slasher flick.A very enjoyable one at that.It has good looking people,great kills and great makeup effects."
3,"Make a Rght Turn and see ""Wrong Turn""","I truly enjoyed this movie! In fact, it's the first ""scary"" movie I've seen in quite a while that had any tension at all. I rate horror movies on a ""jump"" scale--and this one had me jumping quite often. I won't give away any plot details, but the tree descension scene was something else. And the guy at the gas station/country market was one of the most gross people ever introduced in a movie.The gore in this movie is not over the top, in my opinion. I've noticed other ""named"" critics who have just skewered this movie. It has been compared to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes. I would like to say that I view movies to be ENTERTAINED--that's all. I don't go looking for some deep, hidden message. If that's what you like, then I'd say this is your type of movie also."
3,Hillbilly Mayhem!!,"If you like scary movies like I do, or at least cannibal-mutant-hillbilly movies, you'll probably enjoy ""Wrong Turn"". Sure it's formula as far as the plot goes, but how many cannibal-mutant-hillbilly movies do you get to see? If you just go for the ride, you'll have a blast.After a chemical spill stops traffic on the highway, a guy decides to take an off road adventure around it which begins the ""wrong turn"" of the movie's title. He runs into a group of people who had the same idea and now they're stuck and lost in the woods. The mutated hillbillies that call that neck of the woods home are okay with that because they all eat humans and it's supper timeBelieve it or not, the hillbillies are a very dangerous threat having hunted all their lives, although I'm sure it's hard to eat with so few teeth."
1,Wrong Turn,"Stranded and lost alone in the mountains of West Virginia, six teenagers of the anoying kind long since thought dead after 'Scream' find out what Southern hospitality means whilst running from three in-bred hillbillies hell-bent on making human jambolaya.Completely irony-free, this is a cross between a Friday the Umpteenth slasher flick and The Hills Have Eyes - taking neither the humour from the first or subtlety from the latter. The film gives only a brief mention of 'Deliverence' and completely ignores 'Southern Comfort' when a more accomplished director would have paid better homage and at least given a subtle nod to the movies from which it is born.As the 'jumps' are broadcast with the subtlety of a hammer, this movie does as least become unintentionally funny as they run around the dense West Virginia forest generally screaminga la Shaggy and Scooby.At least the scenery is nice."
4,Above average inbred cannibal hillbilly saga.,"Sunday, February 13, 2005 / 4 of 5 / Above average inbred cannibal hillbilly saga.Eliza Dushku stars in this actually pretty good take on the genre popularized by Deliverance. As usual we get a group of good looking kids stranded on the back roads of West Virginia. Why anyone would be in the back woods of West Virginia in the first place is beyond me, but at any rate they are soon met by the male protagonist, a budding med student. Members of the party are soon dispatched by a trio of good ol' mountain boys. You know the type, deformed after generations of inbreeding, super strong, tough to kill, wily, good hunters, non-discriminatory eaters. The plot is pretty linear and straight forward for this type of film, but it delivers a decently taut experience. Above average."
1,"Horrible movie with a lot of blood, gore, and no plot.",I love movies...even bad ones. So for me to say a movie is bad it has to be REALLLLLLY bad. This movie was a lot like chainsaw massacre. There wasnt much of a story either...just people running from disfigured inbreed woodsmen who are looking to kill people and keep body parts as a trophy. Theres just an overkill of blood and gore. I also thought it was boring and fast forwarded through much of the movie! But if youre looking for a movie with a high gross out factor than this is a good one.
4,if this only showed up...,"i like this horror movie, but i havent recieved it yet from amazon and i bought it over 2 weeks ago. it cant take that long at all. that aside this is a good movie has some gore and a creppy feel to it. the sequel even though has a smaller budget, is also worth watching"
4,Scary and Entertaining,"Of course, most of the critics didn't think too much of this. Why? The plot isn't amazing and it's not an epic film, but hey, movies are meant to entertain and this one sure does. The acting is well done, the suspense is nice, and the special effects are cool looking. There was a lot of gore I think they added so they could say ""look what I can do,"" but I thought this was a great movie nonetheless. If you like horror movies at all, or slasher flicks, more than likely you'll like this. I loved it. It was a lot of fun and it scared me in quite a few scenes. I agree with another review, this movie has some amazing scenes in it.The only thing I thought was horribly wrong was in then scene when the two guys try to distract the villians, they scream ""Hey! Over here! Come and get me!"" and then later the girl does it too. Fortunately, the dumb hillbillies didn't notice... but anyone with a brain would realize they're trying to distract you so they can do something..."
4,Bring on the Sequel!,"I purchased and watched this movie when it was released. Great movie and worth buying for all you horror movie fans. Acting is good, photography, sound and make-up effects. Kept me on the edge of my seat. It has graphic scenes, but they did a good job of not making it overly gross. If your looking for a good horror movie...watch this one. Hope they make a sequel!"
2,Just like other horror movies,"This one might scare you if it's the first horror movie you've ever seen. For everyone else, ""Wrong Turn"" has nothing to offer you haven't seen before. Fans of Dushku may also enjoy this ""Faith"" kind of character in ""Buffy"". But those expecting any more than another film in which a ""up-and-coming young stars"" gets slaughtered, look elsewhere."
3,3.5 stars not bad but not wow!,You know what i thought it would have been really cheesey but i like it alot it has thrilling moments i would keep this for my collection
4,Scary and disturbing,"wrong turn is about a guy who is trying to get to somewhere and he takes a wrong turn when the highway is backed up. He runs into this car and meets the people in it. A couple about to get married, a smartass boy and girl, and the always sexy Eliza Dushku. They start walking to find a place to get help. The boy and girl get killed and the movie begins. This is a very suspencful thriller, but i really hated the stupid annoying girl who is always crying or screaming, i was happy when she got the axe in the mouth. But other than her, the movie is great."
3,Gorror Movie,"I can't believe some of the reviews I read. This isn't Shakespeare people. This is a slasher/horror/gore movie. There's screaming, blood, gross-outs, and deformed-inbred mountain men, do you really think this is award winning stuff?Geez, take it as it is. A decent scarey movie that will creep you out (at least for a little while) about going into the woods. We enjoyed it. It was a good 90+ minute movie. That about covers it."
3,The best horror movie of 2003.,"That's all. ""Wrong Turn"" was the best horror movie of the last year; it has at least two GREAT scenes. However, I was VERY disappointed when * SPOILER * the three mutated cannibals turned out to be supernatural immortal Jason-like monsters. I think a community (was one of the three a female?) of degenerate human beings would have been much more interesting.I don't think the comparison of ""Wrong Turn"" with ""Deliverance"" is a fair one, both to ""W.T."", which doesn't have the ambition to be more than a good pop-corn movie, and to ""Deliverance"", which is a classic and a (little) piece of art."
3,Murderous imbreds,"""Wrong turn"" is your average horror movie. Set in West Virginia it provides a lot of gore and blood as well as a lot of cleavage. It seems that the 2 points the movie wants to prove is the amount of blood and guts as well as the amount if cleavage shots. If you like gory movies you'll love this. I jumped in a few parts. Its your regular summer movie fun. Not the best movie if you come from WV since the redneck jokes of WV are a lot."
3,"Not bad at all, but...","...a little short. The end of the movie came so sudden that the ending itself became the biggest ""shocker"" of a movie that starts out to seem something like a B-horrormovie -but somewhere in the middle manages to make a ""right turn"", and becomes very watchable indeed. But because of the lenght of the movie it never really managed to build itself up to a remembarable climax. I've seen far better movies (that includes the remake of ""The Texas Chainmassacre"" with Jessica Biel), but ""Wrong Turn"" is a bit original -and becomes that way rather ""artistical"", if you get my meaning (something about the filming, and the various angle-experimenting -simple, but characteristic). The acting is ok, the ending a bit ""unworthy"" than the rest of ""Wrong Turn"".But I bought the movie, and I don't regret it!"
1,wrong turn?????,"This movie is so predictable!!! a group of teenagers make a wrong turn to get somewhere quicker, OOH!! obviously you know what is going to happen. there were very few good parts but overall this movie does not let you be surprised by what will happen. if you guess what will happen next, your right!! not enough anticipation in this movie! if you want a movie that is too obvious to be true this is for you, but if you want one that will keep you guessing and keep you on the edge of your seat, this one is NOT for you!!!!!!"
2,Okaay,"I don't know if this movie or the Hills Have Eyes came out first, but they were sort of the same. The one chick I was just hoping she would hurry up and die. She kept saying ""I Can't, I Can't"" I would have left her right there. Other than that pretty predictable movie. Glad I bought it for cheap!!"
2,Stupid people,"Why can't we have a horror movie where the victims show a modicum of intelligence. That would make it even scarier. This one is a by the numbers, knock down the preppies."
2,Not original enough with stupid villains.,"I am sorry, but I hated watching this. The two stars are for the scary parts that actually could work an audience. Eliza Dusku could've picked a better movie. Such wasted talent. The killers were ork wannabes and unrealistic. This could've been a whole lot better. A time waster."
4,chilling,"This is one of the most chilling films I have seen. I actuallt watched this by accident, I am not a fan of horror films, but as it was on, I was completely gripped. A great storyline and well acted. It is so gross it is worth a watch."
4,Fantastic!,Loved this movie so much! It was really creepy and the lead was amazing. One of the few horror movies with a sensible female lead.
4,One of the better horror films of our generation.,"I'm not a fan of horror films, in particularly ones from the last decade, but this one is actually quit good. Worth seeing!"
3,Wrong Turn,"I thought this movie was pretty good. I'm from WV, and I really didn't find it very offensive. It scared the hell out of me, but that's about all. I don't think I'll ever go back into the mountains again. I hate them anyway! But, all in all, the movie was great and scary!!!"
4,The Hills Have Eyes?!,"Wrong turn is a good suspense horror movie for 2003 but with a 70's feel. It is very close in plot to the hill have eyes, traped in a desolate location, crazy mutated hicks. The kills are good but typical, the acting is ok, and the charactors are likeable. All in all if you like horor movies check this one out it's worth a viewing."
3,Good but fades out!,This is a loose remake of texas chainsaw massacre. It is not bad but it gets cheesy at the end with the superhero killing all the bad guys. Overall: DECENT.
3,What do you expect? Just have fun!,"I love horror movies, so I'm always a little biased towards schlock like Wrong Turn. My DVD collection includes vampires, werewolves, a man-eating mermaid, a killer tooth fairy and now: inbred mutant West Virginia mountain men!The flick is almost identical to Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but has some fun scenes up in the branches of California redwood trees. And how can I neglect Eliza Dushku? You have to love this fiesty, lovely tomboy. If it were not for her I don't think that I (or anyone else, for that matter) would have given Wrong Turn a second glance. She manages to carry the film to an entertaining conclusion.It's predictable, violent, and fun. Nothing new or original, but the movie embraces horror film stereotypes and does them justice. Don't pay much for this movie and don't go in with high expectations -- but break out the popcorn and enjoy."
3,Pretty good movie - BAD PQ,This is not that old a film. The Transfer should be way better then this. It is very soft almost none of the detail that you expect from Blu ray. Is this the fault of DNR gone crazy??? The sound is awsome and the film itself is a fun little throwback to the horror films of the 70's. But man the picture quality sucks!
4,"Not the best, but still satisfies","Right off hand I'm gonna tell that this movie isn't anything you haven't seen before. It has a typical horror movie set up: a bunch of young people in the woods in the backcountry of some state who run into a bunch of psychos who want to hunt them down and butcher them. If you're thinking "" wow, that sounds a lot like the Texas Chain Saw Massacre"", well, you'd be thinking right. There's even a gas station scene with a weird creepy hick. But I'm not trying to convey the message that is a Chain saw Massacre rip-off. Texas Chain Saw Massacre was awesome, so I see no problem in people wanting to make more movies like it. But anyways, Wrong Turn offers nothing new to genre, it's just a plain good ole slice 'em and dice 'em popcorn horror flick. It's not trying to be exceptional, it's just trying be a horror film with enough blood, gore and thrills to suffice any horror fan for the 84 duration time, and in that context, it succeeds."
4,"unoriginal, but good horror film","With this film ""Wrong Turn"" we get a cross between ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Deliverance."" One SUV runs over a string of barb wire that was placed in the road, soon a guy trying to make a job interview takes a short cut on a backwoods road, and while playing with his radio,runs into the SUV.Of the six people, we are introduced to four of them go off in search of help.They find this cabin out in the middle of nowhere,so they enter the cabin in search of a phone, soon these inbred trollish looking guys come to the cabin with the body of one of the groups friends. That is when they discover that they way never make it home.From this point on, they've got to out wit the inbreds to survive.Wrong Turn is not really a very original movie,we've everything from this movie in other movies, but Wrong Turn is entertaining for it's 85 minutes, so if you like movies like House of 1,000 Corpses and Texas Chainsaw Massacre I'm sure you'll enjoy Wrong Turn."
4,good horror movie,"If you're a fan of cheesy horror films with plenty of gore you'll like this one. It takes place in West Virginia and it's basically about a bunch of cannibal inbreds that live in the woods and kill people. The writing isn't that good, and some parts are really stupid. One stupid part I'll note is the scene where they jump out of the watch tower. Now this tower is at least 100 feet in the air, and they jump out of it and land safley in the trees below without a scratch!! Please!! I'm sure you could survive that fall, but with no broken bones, or even a scratch for that matter??? Then they run around through the tree tops like monkeys and knock one of the inbreds out to fall to his death. There were a few stupid scenes, but some of them actually were pretty scary and suspenseful. The acting was ok, not the greatest, but there was plenty of gore which really saved the movie. I liked this one enough to buy it."
4,SuRpRiZinGlY GrEaT,"this movie is a well done horror movie that hasnt been seen b4. its basically about 5 friends and one medical student who get stranded in hickville where there is no one anywhere to be found.these people picked the wrong place to get stranded. there just happens to be 3 inbred cannibals ""which means there brothers and sisters had them so they are horribly deformed and luv killing people that ""happen "" to have thier car breakdown right in thier woods these 6 strangers have to run 4 thier lives and try to kill these things .if u like sum gore this movies is ur thing HEll yaH ! final destination 2 is The best GORE movie EVER!! pece out ~ pranksta ~"
2,Ridiculous anti rural hate propaganda,"Why two stars? Because it was so completely off that it at least made me laugh. I've been to West Virginia and only about .01% of the population fit this stereotype (and to a far lesser degree...no sasquash there). Of course, all stereotypes are based on some amount of truth, but don't you find it interesting how hollywood conveniently pushes certain stereotypes and does it's best to cover up or even compensate for others?I am originally from New Orleans, Louisiana, and it is a proven fact that there is more interbreeding in the African American population of the projects and inner city because of fraternal uncertainty than there is in rural America because of ""cousin' lovin'""Think you will ever hear about that from the mainstreme media?"
1,horrible,"One of the worst movies I've seen. It isn't the least scary, the plot sucks, & it's not in any way creative. All these comparisons to Texas Chainsaw are utterly baffling to me. I don't mind a cheesy horror pic, but this was a total waste of time."
3,Hmmmm...,"""Wrong Turn"" is undeniably a different horror movie than many others that have been released in the past. However, it has some good qualities and some bad qualities. The movie concept is creative. The action/chase scenes keep the audiences on the edge of their seats. However, many scenes don't match one another very well(i.e. if someone was being chased by three serial killers, why sleep for eight hours). Some storyline details chance either when they shouldn't have and/or without explaining why. The writers gave the killers a creative and scary edge. However, no one knows their names and how they became the way they are. The movie only explored the fact that they kill, and they're after six campers. The acting is mediocre. Eliza Dushku has performed much better, but she still has potential. Those looking for a horror movie, ""Wrong Turn"" may be good to rent only once. There may be some mixed reviews toward this movie, but many will be entertained."
2,What a rip off,Horrible movie. No plot. Crappy actors. Blah. Lucky for me I work in a video store so it was free for me.
3,Wrong movie,"At first I thought that this wasgonna be a really cool scary moviebut it really took a wrong turn.First the actress called Daniellewas very very a bad actress.I justwanted to go in to the movie to killher.Eliza Dushku didn t show her goodacting in this movie.Secondly the killersweren t scary but funny.They looked likethe hobbits from Lord of The Rings.I youwanna see a movie like this,just rentJeepers Creepers insted."
2,Wrong Movie!,"What a pathetic attempt at creating a horror-movie. This is a total rip-off from other horror-classics and I don't see the point of making a movie that resembles some other movie but is 20 worse than that other of which came in mind to me was the Texas Chains-saw massacre among others. It's an insult to the viewer so unintelligent this movie is. No originality at all, just copied ideas all the way through.This one is just lame. The whole story including every detail is totally predictable and the atmosphere of horror is lacking. Wrong Turn A.K.A Wrong Movie, looks so studied and calculated that it's almost more documentary than film. A documentary about how an attempt of making a scary movie goes. Give me a break..."
4,Great Horror Movie!!,"If you like horror movies, this is a GOOD ONE! It will keep your interest and at the edge of your seat until the end. Rent it or BUY IT!"
5,Wow,"This is an awesome horror movie! It's along the lines of a Texas Chainsaw Massacre type plot but much, much better. It definitley will keep you on the edge of your seat. The gore factor is about an A- (I love gore and thought there could be more but there was enough!) Eliza Dushku does an amazing job in this film. She brought so much life into the movie. I hope every horror fan will give this movie a look! The DVD features were quite interesting also. From beginning to end, this is a fabulous movie.. just great!"
2,If not for Dushku.....,"...the film would lack any redemption. Implausible. unpredictable only in the sense that most people can't imagine anyone getting paid for scripting such stupidity. we naturally expect more. we're usually disappointed. 'Wrong turn' doesn't fail to disappoint or insult a post-95 IQ. Eliza looks great, but is the only, easily palatable aspect of the ""film"". Seriously... I can make garbage as easily as anyone else. I'll take the check. I might even try to craft a believable storyline out of the mix. Anyone?"
1,Eliza Dushku - The ONLY reason to watch this rubbish!!!!!!!!,"In short, ""Wrong Turn"" is REALLY bad. Bad effects, bad acting, bad directing, stupid costumes & an even more stupid storyline. If you like this, you're not a horror fan.+++++++++++++++PLEASE NOTE!! The ONLY reason you should watch this is because of Eliza Dushku's amazingly good looks - she's hot. :)+++++++++++++++DON'T BUY!!!!!!(I would give this this ZERO stars if I could)."
1,Deliverance is a great movie...This movie not so good!!,"To put it nicely this movie stinks. Although some parts of the movie are entertaining and keep you watching this flick hardly meets any of my criteria for a top notch horror movie. The in-bred hillbilly mountain men are not that scary and the acting is very sub-par. An obvious attempt to rip-off TCM and Deliverance. It's really not worth my time to elaborate on it but I will say this...comparing this movie to Deliverance is like comparing Mike Tyson to Fred Savage. If you like trash then you'll like ""Wrong Turn""."
1,Ridiculous,"Wrong Turn is a horrible, horrible teen-slasher movie that takes place in the ""Greenbrier Backcountry"". which, if you are from Greenbrier County you know is far less menacing than most of the forest-land in the state. It was, as the ultimate slap in the face, shot entirely in Canada. Call us scary, homicidal rednecks, but at least shoot on location. Scary, homicidal rednecks have families to feed too.This movie is ridiculous, on many levels. It is insulting to our great State. Note to film companies: we get enough bad press in general, make movies about scary rednecks in a non-specific location, rather than tie it to an area that is so far from what is depicted in this movie."
5,grrrrrrreatttt!!,"Scarry, suspencful and not cheesy! Yes, horror movies are still watchable. I rented it because im an Eliza Dushku fan, and I wasn't even sure what this movei was about, but it turned out I lovded it!It was quite scarry, and I rarely get scared. The part where the kids are hiding under the bed in the kilers house, while they drag in their dead friend and prepare her for dinner is unbelievable......I had to pause the movie, to catch my breath.Great stunts, and good acting from ALL of the costars.Im planning on watching it again, because I really enjoyed it. Woods movies can be really scarry......"
2,"Lots of tension, but needs plot and character development","Wrong Turn (2003) Eliza Dushku, Jeremy Sisto, Emmanuelle Chriqui, Desmond Harrington, Lindy Booth, Kevin Zegers, D: Rob Schmidt.Typically déjà vu throwback to DELIVERANCE and TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE has a med student-headed for Raleigh N.C. to catch an interview-taking the back roads where he plows into a carload of five youths stuck with a flat tire; they get lost in the West Virginia forest and quickly become the kill and food to filthy, disfigured inbreeds.Not the best of its breed, but (as Fangoria magazine would agree) has its share of shocks, gore, and clichés, with a couple good scenes, including one in a treetop. Highest point is the sight of the always-attractive Dushku, who will make your heart skip a beat over the bloodthirsty hillbillies, and nadir is the lack in standard cinematic devices.Running Time: 95 minutes and rated R for strong violence and gore, some language and drug use."
1,"WRONG TURN IS A ""DEAD END""","With all the hype and the cool website the film had to offer, I wandered into my neighborhood cinema expecting a little something different. What I got for my $8.00 was truly miserable. In short, don't waste your time or money on this film. Wrong Turn fails to deliver. Their exists no character development, no motive for the ""inbreds"" to track and kill their prey and the dialogue is pretty sloppy. I have seen very small indies much better than this....the best part of this ""DEAD END"" was the trailers before it.... TRUST ME: YOU WILL BE VERY DISSAPOINTED. Save your money and stay at home, ""Wrong Turn"" is the wrong movie."
4,Back to basics horror...,"After seeing Wrong Turn a second time, I have to say that this is one of the better slasher flicks to have been released in quite awhile. A back to the basics homage to early Wes Craven and Tobe Hooper films. If you truly like horror you will like this film. Although after reading a couple of reviews mentioning JEEPERS CREEPERS as a better horror film, the only thing scary about JC is the fact that the director is a pedophile."
1,Good Movie. BUt something is wrong with the disc.,"I've seen this movie before but didn't own it so i was excited to buy it, i had it a couple of weeks before watching and the movies skips and the frames freeze. Its not in good condition at all. Very upset with this disc. Its is defective/ doesn't work"
3,"Good Entertainment, fun and exciting but no Academy Award winner","If you're looking for an award winning movie you won't find it here, but if you just want something entertaining to watch, you've got it. The movie's bascially a cross between Texas Chainsaw Massacare and Deliverance. It's an enjoyable watch and will give you something to daydream about but it's nothing heart stopping.In my opinion it is NOT anti-rural propoganda, as some of the other reviews have stated. It's just a story of some mutated wackos in WV who kill people. It doesn't make fun of rural folk any more than any other movie. Besides, there's been plenty of Urban based horror movies as well so i don't see what the big deal is. I'm a whole lot more afraid of the guy from SAW and he lived in a city.Anyway, good movie to kill some time, but nothing spectacular. (Definatly worth bargain bin price!)"
3,ALMOST THERE,"This movie is almost there... a little more effort on the directors', screenwriters' and actors' parts and it could have been a Texas Chainsaw-level cult smash. But it falls just shy of that. Worth watching if you remind yourself not to take it seriously ... definitely not as seriously as the director takes himself."
4,wrong turn,great movie right here. You look at all the teeny trash they put out and then you find this movie. A great movie with homage to Texas Chainsaw Massacre about a group of people running from canabalistic forest dwellers. A scary movie with great FX from Savini. Alot of jump from but not to much shock. What i mean by shock is no gore. There was one scene of gore when the dwellers come back to there shack and..... ull find out i dont wanna ruin it for you. Great sound on your Dvd Player. The dvd special features arent great but there ok. Cool 1970's feel with zoom in camera shots.
5,Fantastic,"This horror is def the best for a long time, keeps you on the edge of your seat and gets straight into the action. Jumpy well see it for yourself and find out. This is a must see for all fans of horror films and def one i am going to buy for my collection. Dont wanna say anything about the film and ruin it, all i can say is buy it dont even bother going to the flicks just purchase it for life you wont be disappointed."
5,Great Horror Movie!,"I did not know much about this movie before going to the movies and seeing it, because it was not heavily advertised. But when I went to see it I thought it was a very good horror film. I have always been a big fan of the Friday the 13th's, Halloween's, etc. I have been very disappointed with the recent Jason X among other horror films for getting too sci-fi and not good old school horror. Wrong Turn has the good old school horror type feel to it. Eliza Dushku is such a hottie and does a great job in this film. If you like Texas Chainsaw Massacre then you will like this film."
3,Surprisingly watchable,"Ok... initially I was sceptical about this movie. I thought it's going to be just another one of the standard hack & slash movies. The only reason I watched it was that a friend had purchased it & said it was well done.So I thought why not give it a try. I have to admit, that it was reasonably enjoyable (albeit somewhat cliched at times).The best way I can describe the movie is a cross between the movies ""Deliverance"" and ""Texas chainsaw masacre.""Although there were moments of sheer frustration (from my perspective, in relation to the way the actors handled their encounters), I would suggest it's worth give it a viewing."
2,"Beautiful, but low quality materials","The jar itself is beautiful and very unique, so if you want to make an impression when gifting a jar of something special, this is a good choice, but NOT the best since the lids are aluminum and not a harder metal, so it gets misshapen quickly and it's difficult to get it back into shape. This results in a very poor seal and spills."
5,canning jars,The jars arrived safely and look very pretty on the shelf with my homemade jelly.Thanks
5,Useful and Charming,I wanted a jar that was worthy of gift giving. My sister-in-law taught me how to make plum jam this summer and I thought it would make great Christmas gifts. I chose these jars for their unique shape and charm. I was not disappointed when they arrived. A bit of raffia or ribbon tied around the lid with a homemade tag attached and you have a thoughtful and charming gift.
3,Pretty but,The glass jars are beautiful. But the first time I used these for roasted tomatoes in a water bath none of the lids formed a seal. I switched out the lids to ball jar lids and they sealed fine in the water bath. The jars are still lovely even with ball jar lids so they will make a nice homemade gift.
4,"Unique, I guess...","The odd shape is the only feature worth commenting on.The color of the glass is slightly greenish, instead of crystal-clear."
1,Supposed CD Racks,These boxes are too narrow to hold CD cases. What a rip! They look nice but that makes them even more disappointing.
3,an ok container,"I am using this box to hold diapers next to our portable changing table area. It's fine, but some of the wires stick out on the top and are VERY sharp. Not good when little finger (or even my own) reach it. Otherwise, it'll do as a CD box."
1,Suckiest Band Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"can u even call this music it is bull @#$&. I'd rather rot in the Sahara Desert than listen to the fake imagery of they're so called ""music."""
5,This CD ROCKS!,"For someone who normally listens to New Age music (Enya et al.), this would probably not have been a first choice. But a local TV station has been playing Prozzak's videos ""Sucks To Be You"" and ""Europa"" with regularity. After watching them once, the tunes got into my head and would not leave. So I bought the CD and it is quite possibly one of the best purchases I ever made. The album is laid out like a story and it's all about Simon's search for true love. From the up songs ""Omobolasire"" and ""Mediterranean Lady"" to the down ""Sucks To Be You"" and ""New York"" to the up ""Tsunami"" back to the down of ""Sleep With Myself"" and ""Anna-Lisa"", it's a rollercoaster of great music. If you like good pop-rock, this is a must for your collection."
3,Hot Show!,"I first heard this when it came out in 1999....I wasn't to stuck on it except for 'Omobolasire'. I kept hearing it on the radio and so I tracked this CD down and gave it a listen. I got rid of it because I didnt like it at first. I have since changed my opinion. this is one of those CDs that needs more than one listen to really say whether you like it or not. I recently acquired it in my collection once again and gave it a fair chance and after goin through the entire CD I can say this is a very good disc...by a unique group...And of course, they're canadian so thats a plus right there"
4,Konnie's Review,"I really really love this CD! I first heard the songs ""Sucks to be you"" and ""Strange Disease"" like a few years ago and I loved them so much. I found out who the band was and rushed to the store to get their CD. I listen to the Cdall the time and sing along with it.There is only one song I don't like and that is 'I like to watch(Milo's night out)'becuz I think it's very rude, but other than that I love all the other songs. From the slow, sad song of ""Anna-Lisa"" to the much faster and original song of ""Sucks to Be You"". You have really got to get this CD! I have never heard anyone that sounds like them. Prozzak Rox!"
5,"2 Blue Nylone 12-15"" Spoons","This one was a no brainer, I'm in Pastry school and I can't stand to look like everyone else, they gave of those boring tools and I need some life when I bake, color so I brought these along with a colorful scale so I'm not like anyone else in the school and trust me they noticed it, I'm the only one in the school with these.Thanks"
3,They do a decent job,They are made of a heavy duty plastic. I don't recommend using them with tomato sauces as it will cause discoloring of the spoon.
4,long handles,Pleased with the spoons although the handles are long so you have to be careful that you don't bump them especially if you have it in the pan. I would be careful around small kids.
3,No label?,"It is strange that nowhere on the spoon does it say anything about MIU or any other brand. These are stiff, good for stirring, not for spooning."
2,NOT EXACTLY WHAT I ORDERED!,"I bought these Cooking Spoons, part because of the Reviews and part because of the nice dark blue color which is the color in my Kitchen. I can always tell when it takes a while to receive an Item,..... something has gone wrong. I got them few days ago and they are both a different shade of light blue, nothing like the color posted on the website, they are NOT even the same color both, ...go Figure! They seem very strong but I Do Not Like Them, and that is the reason for the two stars. I know it is just a Spoon! However, I do not care when they send you what ever they want and NOT what you have ordered!"
1,Plastic barriers make letters difficult to form,"The letters are interruped with peices of plastic barriers, so they are non-continuous. The child has to lift their pencil to get over the plastic barriers while writing a single letter. Instead of writing a continuous circle for ""O"", the child traces the top half of the circle, lifts their pencil over the barrier, and traces the lower half. That's not a natural way to write, and is frustrating for the child because when they lift the guide off the paper they still have to connect the parts of the letter for the whole letter to form."
3,long lost treasure,"great true story about passion, and obsession. The film is inaccurate in that although Walter Maresh was a German, and a terrorist he was a left winger, not a neo fascist."
5,Fun Classic Dixieland,"An excellent recording of pure simple classic dixieland jazz. This group clearly has a lot of fun with these tunes. I enjoy their upbeat arrancements and the fine mix of tuba, sax, piano, drum, clarinet, bango, and trumpet. Not a bad tune in the set. I ordered more, gave it to friends and am looking forward to their next CD. And they're from England... Wow. I didn't now they had it in them."
1,A great disappointment,"The copyright notice for this book says: ""the text in this book has been downloaded from the internet and has been extensively edited and typeset.""I bought this book with the intention of reading the original text, not an ""extensively edited edition"".The book also says: ""Copyright 2006"". There is no mention of the original date of publication (in was in the 20's) or of who published it and where.To make matters worse, if that were possible, the book is called an EasyRead Edition, despite the text being printed in blocks of type; there are no indentations for paragraphs or conversations.In short, there is nothing easy to read about this truncated, sloppily (lazily) typeset edition. I wanted to read the original text, and I do not recommend this inferior reproduction.The publishers should be ashamed of this product."
3,Past its Use By Date,"Published in 1917 and based on the author's expereince on Capri, this rather long winded novel failed to interest apart from the occasional witty observation. Very little plot and characters that are observed well but with little meaningful or interesting interaction between them. Some people will definitely be amused by some of the eccentric characters but at over 400 pages long this alone is not sufficient to maintain interest. The murder on page 360 was after a long slog. Read it if social history about foreigners living on a small island circa 1900 in the mediterranean (the fictitious island of Nepenthe in the book) is your special interest. However, I suggest reading Compton Mackenzie's ""Vestal Fire"" which I found a much more amusing insight to expatriate life on Capri."
1,Don'd buy the e-book,Terrible quality. Letters are way too small to read. I bought it and returned within 1 hour as my 2nd grader (who generally is a good reader) had trouble viewing/reading it.
2,Don't buy the Kindle version,"Although the story is a very nice one, please do not buy the Kindle version. That version is two pages side by side scanned in what makes it impossible to read as the text is very small. You cannot adjust the font because it is scanned. Impossible to read on the Kindle Fire or iPad; and barely OK using a large screen. Credit to Amazon who refunded it immediately when I complained."
3,Good story but WAY to wordy for the 4 and under crowd,I got this for my 4 year old to help him learn about thanksgiving but we have only read part of it. It is almost a chapter book. It will be good for when he's 7 or 8 but for his age it was too much book.
1,still waiting,"I know my son will love it when he finally gets his Christmas present, but it's been a month now and it's still on backorder. It doesn't even show up on items that I've ordered in the past 6 months, but I know it was deducted from my checking account. How can that be? In addition to that I had originally been told that the item had been delivered the first week of December but like I said my son never recieved it.......might think about adding a confirmation of receipt with the orders they ship, because it either was never shipped or someone else is enjoying my son's present!"
4,A very good pocket reference,"A very handy pocket reference book for cheap! As good as most Palm programs, but it costs much less. Good for the EM Resident/Attending."
3,dont cry,"wow, i never realized dont cry was about past lives either until i just saw the video recently...i guess i was too young to get it when i saw it before...but all of axl's words are really profound. in civil war, they are totally profound especially. axl is a genious. slash is a musical genius that plays guitar how people play the violin. i could totally feel vibes coming from his guitar and that totally moves me. i miss really good guitar playing where it is actually soulful. (sniff sniff), well never see it again..."
1,i can't see any difference from old one...,"Okey, I like the way Axl Rose performed. He can enjoy the viewers and the fan's. All I can say is I'm GNR's one in a million's fan. Go!! Go!! GNR..."
2,Pretty Bad,"This book wasn't very good. First of all, the fact that an entire school is going to Hawaii for no reason whatsoever is COMPLETELY unrealistic. Next, the adventures of the babysitting weren't that exciting-not even Stacey's. She was on a helicoptor that crashed, but her adventures mainly focused on walking back to where they were supposed to be. What really bugged me about this story is that there was almost NO plot. The whole plot is: The baby-sitters go to Hawaii. They do stuff. They come back. That's what most Super Specials are about, but other ones are written better and the adventures are actually realistic (since when do 13-year-olds act in commercials by pretending that they're 18, and having everyone believe them?). If you're a die-hard BSC fan, then you'll probably like this book. Otherwise, stick to realistic books that actually have a plot."
1,STUPID with a capitol STU!,"Although well-written and interesting, the whole thing is stupid. WHat makes the BSC so special that they can travel the world like that? Why, when I was in school they wouldn't even let us go to Eastern Washington (which is only a few hundred miles from where we are in Western Washington. It hacked me off!"
3,Study guide or novelette,"I was looking for an exposition on Acts that expanded my view and knowledge on the early church. This book does not provide any exposition on the book of Acts. This is really a GROUP study guide. There about two intro paragraphs every chapter and then a series of discussion questions. This might be nice for a small group study, but not what really for a solo study guide."
2,Where are these 5 star ratings coming from?,"First off, I am a HUGE MST3K fan. I get most of the inside stuff and I generally have a great appreciation for ""stupid"" humor. Having said that, this episode just didn't do it for me. I and a friend (every bit the MST3K fan I am) just finished watching this episode and counted maybe 10 chuckles between us. A mighty low count compared to other shows. We had the highest of hopes based on the reviews on Amazon. Maybe we set our hopes too high and couldn't help but be disappointed. Bottom line, we just didn't laugh that much where other episodes have had us in tears. IMHO, this one deserves 2 stars at best."
3,"Good, but not among the best...","I've seen about 3/4 of all the MST3Ks ever made, and a bigger fan there never was. This one has it's moments, but it's hard even for the guys at Best Brains to make this POS movie funny. If you've gotta have 'em all, go ahead and get this one...if you're new to the Mistie experience, though, it's hard to top ""Mitchell""."
3,"The horror, the horror . . .","I'm sorry, but this bargain basement Conan rip off was so bad that even the MST3K antics could not save it (they were the only reason for three stars instead of zero). I did get a laugh out of the bots costuming up like the idiots in the film. And also the ""say something!"" comments (as the actors consistently missed their cues). But this film was so bad -- the continuity, delivery of lines, ridiculous costumes. The whole thing was ridiculous. I can't imagine how it was ever released. (I also think the MST gang missed a chance for some great ""Freddie Mercury"" comparisons to that villian guy . . . the one that looked like Freddie Mercury). Again, my apologies MST, but I just can't rate this very highly. You gave it a noble try, but the movie itself stinks so bad it was just no fun suffering through it."
4,Thank God Joel and the bots are watching this with us!,"Cave Dwellers is mind-numbingly bad. Without our three wisecrackers you could expect to at least dose off within 10 minutes into it (or run away screaming). But thanks to the boys on the SOL (Satellite Of Love) it's 90 minutes of hilarity. Lots of funny riffs: ""Why is she limping?"" ""Well, she's got an...arrow in her chest..."". Several of the best ever host segments: sound fx lesson and the one about the goofs in the movie (""Raybands!""). I give this one a 4.5 out of 5. It's Miles O'Keefe. I mean, it's Miles O'Fun!"
4,Pretty boys and pretty girls try to save the world.,"Well at least Miles O'keefe's hairdresser was paid well. Can you believe the ""Farrah Fawcett"" hairdo on this barbarian? All in all,not a horrendeous movie, just low budget and bad actors. XXXXd the end where Joel and the bots pointed out the bloopers. ""Who's that wearing those Foster Grants?"". Oh, and where else could you find growling snakes? Would recommend."
4,This one ranks with the best.,"I tell you the first time I seen this episode I laughed so much my ribs hurt. I first saw this episode when one of the channels still showed the old episodes and it made me a loyal fan of MST3K.The best line in that episode to me was ""Wong the fish is ready""Wait just a few dozen more"".Enough said just get the video and you will agree with me on how funny this episode is. ""The Cave Dwellers""."
4,Carrizo Gorge - Required Study Material!,"I've used this book EXTENSIVELY in studying about the Carriso Gorge (Carrizo Gorge). I highly recommend it. It's also well narrated if you're just looking for railroad reading... VERY good book! Only wish it had more ""current"" information, but then, how could it? Is there a second book coming? Who knows? (Mr. Hanft?...) Recent news reads like this RR ""MAY"" one day live again!"
3,good graphics,i enjoyed the game very much. I like games like this. similar to company of heroes but a little less graphics and AI.I would still recommend. i also received it just in time for xmas
4,Dreaming alive,"What is more marvellous than a dream ? Is it living a dream or dreaming our life ? Georgia O'Keeffe gives us both. Looking at her paintings, we can dream alife that we are living a dream. Our soul becomes full of generosity and tenderness. A feeling of plenitude gives us the secret of passion for life and our trauma are suddenly vanishing."
4,Terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is the worst racing game I have ever played! graphic is poor; it is extremely hard to control and it is not realistic; it is more like the $.99 PC game I used to play when I was a kid.Avoid.................
5,Finally...,"After searching for this single for over 10 years, I am extremely satisfied with this purchase!"
3,THIS is the best of Dana Carvey?!,"The video was ok, but I don't think they really included all his best skits."
4,Best of Dana Carvey,"I bought this because I look back at those years of SNL with happy memories that I still remember to this day. Dana Carvey's bit of the Church Lady is what I really wanted to see again. This DVD has the skit of Church Lady that I remember the most. The one with Sean Penn when he was married to Madonna and being offered ten million dracmas for the dancing woman skit. Kinda wish that the whole DVD was about Church Lady but it has many skits of his that I forgot about. If you loved Dana Carvey, then get this DVD. It will make you laugh and smile."
3,"Not a bad deal, but could've been better","Ever since I saw Dana Carvey for the first time, I have been a big fan. All of his impressions are spot on and hilarious. While this DVD does contain some great sketches, it was lacking in some parts. One thing I wish they would've done was show the complete sketches of his impressions instead of just clips (Regis, George Michael, Woody Allen, the Church Lady...) Some of the skits also could've been left out and weren't that funny. The funniest parts, I thought, were the bonus features which included two interviews and his original audition tape.While this DVD could've been better, it was worth the $7.50 spent."
5,Ross Perot only wishes he could do Ross Perot this good!,"Dana Carvey was among the 2 or 3 most talented performers in the long history of Saturday Night Live, at least in my opinion.His best work seems to age timelessly as seen in this highlight DVD.His impression of Ross Perot is entertainment at its best!! No matter how many times I have seen it, I always enjoy seeing it again!"
2,DVD is another SNL cut up mess,"Well, any SNL or Dana fan will be very disappointed in this DVD.The Church Lady and the Church Chat bits. One of his classic characters right? NOT one entire sketch. They cut up several of them. Just ruined the whole thing.Wayne's World, cut up.Other sketches cut up.This has been done on several of the SNL Best Of DVD's.Very disappointing, a let down."
3,It's amazing how versatile he was.,Some of the clips are rather dated. People like Ross Perot who are no longer household names. His George Bush Sr impression doesn't seem as accurate now. It would have been nice to see more Church lady skits.
5,Grown ups will love it too!,"De Paulo's humor is so dry, yet so innocent, that kids and adults will laugh together. This is one our kids outgrew long before we tired of it."
2,Disappointing and self congratulatory,"Jay Quinn tells us on every page, through the character of Chris, what a great mom he is, how pretty he is, how good his butt is, how he did the best he could, sacrifice, martyrdom and constant constant self congratulatory rhetoric. I found the concept of the story fascinating, but the writing sophomoric and its purpose to make everyone else in the book secondary to the greatness and grace of Jay Quinn. The dialogue is completely unrealistic and comes off silly. Mr. Quinn should never take up screenwriting. I had to keep reading just to laugh out loud every time he had another character tell him how fabulous he was. It gets ridiculous. It is a surface novel which screams 'love me' at the top of its lungs. I kept imagining one of Charles Busch's characters saying his lines. It's that corny. Too bad. If he weren't so wrapped up in himself and his need for approval, Jay Quinn might allow himself to go deeper and actually turn out to be a good writer."
2,I wanted to like this but...,"I didn't. The story seemed interesting, but I just didn't like the writing-and a lot of it didn't ring true, many of the things the characters said sounded false, and 'written', not like anything an actual person would say-especially the exchange between the main character and his ex's wife-it all seemed phony-while the story arc was entertaining, none of it seemed real. So overall, not recommended."
2,Disappointing,"I admit I was only able to get to about page 100 before giving up on this well meaning but--for me at least--boring book. I like the fact that the protagonist is over 40 and the story is not set in a big city, but I didn't particularly like or care much about any of the characters in the book--which is problematic in a book where the characters (to paraphrase Jon Lovitz as Harvery Fierstein) just want to be loved.I agree with a lot of the negative criticism in other reviews: the main character just seemed too feminine, the dialogue was unrealistic and a lot of the catholic stuff was just off putting.The plot also was way too obvious in many places; for example, when Chris is so worried what the priest will say to him, how can there be any doubt the priest will surprise him and be great?The main reason this all bothers me, and why I'm writing this review, is that I think the author has some talent. All that potential is just wasted in this silly, dull book."
5,"An interesting premise, beautifully executed","Jay Quinn has given us characters that seem real and full of life. The premise is out of the ordinary for the typical gay novel, but is handled very, very well.After 22 years of being the husband of Zack and ""mother"" to his children, Chris finds himself replaced. The story of his new life and his relationship with his ""children"" forms the basis of the book. I hate it when reviews give away plot points and story details, so I refuse to do that. Just know that it evolves beautifully and makes you wish that these were people you could visit with frequently.Read it - you'll be very glad you did."
4,A Lovely Read,"Although I understand where some people are coming from with their 'disappointed' reviews, and I missed the apparent typos(thank goodness) I still found this an engaging, swift moving and at times, a highly emotional read-and I finished it in a couple of days, very satisfied, even if the ending was a bit over the top.Perhaps this is a book for the romantic escapist, not a reader who wants a reality check. In a film, Myrna Loy's character says(and I paraphrase), ""Who says movies should be more like life? I think life should be more like the movies.""I think life should be more like this book."
1,Pointless,"I really wanted to like this well-meaning tale of middle-aged man trying to rebuild his life after he's dumped by his boyfriend of twenty years for a Joan Collins character. But in the end, I wanted to get back some of the life that I'd wasted reading this self-congratulatory tripe, featuring the most wooden, agonising dialogue since James Earl Hardy's last effort. But the worst part of it is nothing happens. Nothing! Unless you count having Catholicism rammed down your throat by a bunch of one dimensional bores being terribly nice to one another. Then, to add insult to injury, in the final pages one character refers to the sex of her unborn twins by saying ""one nice package and one tiny little t***."" I can't recall having ever read such an ill-judged and tasteless piece of imagery.I wish that, like the title character, I was back where I started - before I'd ever picked this up."
4,Not bad--not deep but shallow at times,"I like Jay Quinn's books, and I liked this one. Sure, it is a little trite--with the main character everything works out for him in everything he does. Sure, he is feminine--but c'mon critics--there are a number of feminine gay men in the world and this is a story of one. Upper class who got a good settlement from his ex, it is a great read if you are looking for a good feel story."
5,a masterpiece of insight into anti-semitism,"I have read this book at least three times and I believe it provides some of the greatest insight into the jewish condition that has ever been committed to print. Sartre's understanding of the position of the jew in modern society is unparalled,as are his observations of the mind of the anti-semite. This book is a must for anyone who wants to understand the true nature of the phenomenon of psychological anti-semitism within the context of modern society."
1,A Waste of Money!!!,"Well, did i get taken. $12.95 for a TAPED TV PRINT with missing sound!!! This is the last time I will buy a movie from the CHEEZY FLICKS label. You even get the staation logo in this DVD so you will know they taped it from TV and did a muddy recording to DVD. Where they cut the commercials out, you have missing sound. If you wish to see this movie go to IMDB and then to FanCast and watch it. Irt is 100 times more clearer than this garbage. AMAZON - do yourself a favor and DO NOT carry the Cheezy Flicks DVD's. Your customers will be much happier. If I could rate this ZERO I would!"
2,bad picture,"I saw this movie as a young child only once and thought it pretty scary. When I saw it was being released on DVD I was on the edge as to by it or not. I watched on HULUand thought the picture was worth getting.What I got was very muddy, not at all like what I saw. The distributor - Cheesy Ficks (?) must have gotten a very bad copy of a VHS to make this transfer.I will keep it because I want the film but I will get another copy with a better picture as soon as possible."
3,the lost missile,"For those of you that don't want to pay 15.00 for a dvd or a Cheezy Flicks version off TV, TCM shows it from time to time with digital quality like DIRECT TV (where I made my DVD-R copy for free)Check TCM website for showtimes or email me at dnbrddck@yahoo.com if I can help.DonAtlanta"
5,101 Needlepoint Stitches,"I bought this book for a reference, and it is great. The examples are clear, and include suggestions for best use. I like to suggestions about materials, canvas, and needles."
3,Not what I was looking for,This book has many types of stitches but they are too complicated for the layman in needlepoint. I wasted my money.
3,It's minimal okay,"Was looking for a supplemental stitch reference. This is an oversized book that is black and white print & photos only, making it difficult to view/use the stitching diagrams. It really isn't necessary to be oversized as almost 50% of the space is blank. For $9.95, I'll keep but would recommend looking for another book if you're an experienced needlepointer."
2,Leather comes away from the soul,"Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the leather peels up away from the soul at both the toes and heels after only a few weeks of use. I'm going to have to shoe goo these bad boys and hope for the best."
3,Not waterproof - but otherwise fine,"I like the sandal, but it is not very resistent to water. If you are not going to the pool or the beach they are fine."
5,Not sure where the hate is coming from...,"Just got my pair and I love them. Well made, exactly the same color as I ordered, and they're some of the most comfortable shoes I own. Can't go wrong here, so I'm not sure where the negative reviews are coming from. I hesitated before buying because of some of the weird feedback on this site, but I'm glad I went ahead with it. Great purchase. I wear size 10.5, ordered size 11, they fit perfectly. Love them."
3,defective reefs?,"As a previous owner of Reef's 'Smoothy' flip flops, I knew what to expect when I ordered these. These are great flip flops and will last several years if they aren't abused. Unfortunately, I seem to have received a bad pair. The left sandal is noticeably smaller than the right one. I thought that maybe I was just imagining things, but after wearing them for a few days, I can still notice it and it's quite annoying. I don't know if these come in different widths and I received a mixed pair or what. Either way, just be careful before you hastily rip the tags off of these. I'm being optimistic and hoping that the left sandal will feel better as they are broken in because they are great sandals otherwise!"
3,Cool sandal.,The sandal are beautiful and really cool but the quality are not very high. The sole have start to take of the main part shortly after the first walk.
5,Oh yeah,Purchased for my son; it's a good looking slide that looks good on his feet. Great for easy days around the house or beach.
3,Sandal is built for an very narrow foot type,I would consider my foot average width and this shoe was too tight. I would try a reef sandal on in a store before making the purchase.
2,Stained my feet,Bought these for my honeymoon. They are comfortable and fit fine....however my feet are now black after wearing them wet. I'm assuming this will not continue after a few uses. I'm just hoping they didn't use any toxic chemicals in production...
1,Dreadful!,"Dreadful, dreadful, dreadful! I bought these because I was led to believe they were the 'Gold Standard' in flip-flops. The sole started to come away from the uppers within four wearings on the shoe. Buy some other make and forget the hype about this piece of 'shoe'!"
4,Dress sandal,"This is my first leather sandal by Reef and it is growing on me. You need to break it in, unlike their other Reef sandals that are really comfortable from the getgo. This one is becoming more comfortable as I wear it. I am still not taking long walks but it might become one of my favorites."
1,2 different colors,"I received this product as promised. Didn't wear them or notice that they were two different colors until a couple of weeks after I received them. My daughter pointed out that they were two different colors while on vacation. I realize that with this type of leather you will have some variations however, one is really brown and the other tan. Not happy and too late to return."
3,flipin' n flopin',"true to size, well made, nice looking. dropin' Hamiltons on pedicures just to be a flipin' n flopin'."
3,Nice; but...,Nice quality but size 9 was shorter than any size 9 I've tried on recently. Had to return it. Return process went smoothly.
2,Lasted one year...,"Bought them for my honeymoon. They are comfortable! However the strap that goes between the toes came loose and then broke apart. I was running while wearing them, but still disappointed that they fell apart this quickly. Wore them about twice a week for a year. Also the soles started to show cracks and creases several months in."
1,Two Right Feet,What can I say? This box held shoes for two right feet.And the surface of the shoe is a soft brown -looks like a coating that will rub off on the soles of my feet.
2,Stylist but cheap,"After about two months of normal use, the leather upper began to separate from the man-made sole. This happened on both sandals, and I'm disappointed because previous Reef products I have owned lasted several years."
5,No surprises,I received exactly what I ordered. They are of same quality of Reef's that I've bought in the store.My husband has worn them for over a month now and he has no complaints.
1,Bad quality from amazon,Normally love Reef sandals and have had great luck with the last 3 pairs purchased locally. This was the first pair purchased from Amazon and after 1 month the sole started to separate - nothing abnormal in the wear. Be careful.
2,Not as expected,"I like the Paul Smith Extreme for men; however, this one was really disappointing. Smells more for women."
4,bozos review,"Great nostalgic trip to the t.v shows of old. Frank Avaruch was always my favorite Bozo. Even the grandchildren enjoyed the show as much as the adults. The little thing they did with trying to add graphics wasn`t so great , even so, it was well worth buying."
1,Bizarro Bozo,"While I do not disparage the ""Bozo"" of the Boston area, there is only one true Bozo - the late, great Bob Bell. As a kid in the suburbs (far suburbs) of Chicago in the 70s, Bozo, Ray Raynor, and the Son of Svenghoolie were kings to me and my friends. I'm sure the ""Bozo"" of the Boston area was ok, but there can only be one Bozo Show to me.Even Dan Castellaneta of the Simpsons said that the character, Krusty the Klown, was modeled after Bob Bell's Bozo in Chicago!"
2,Color?,"I bought these and they looked good. I washed them before the first use and they turned pink. They function well but I keep them stored in a ""utensil holder"" so I was looking for red, not pink. So I wouldn't get them unless you are looking to toss them in a drawer."
4,Good Quality,"These spoons are heavy duty and good quality. They stand up to being left inside a pot while it's on the stove. My only complaint is that the color is pink and not red. My husband definitely made a comment about this and said he won't be using these. Other than the color being misrepresented, these are good utensils."
4,They are pink - NOT red!,These spoons are very strong and sturdy.I'm only giving them 4 stars because they are pink... not red.
1,Color awful,"The spoons I received were a very awful shade of dusty fuscia, not red at all. They were not at all what I was wexpecting."
3,Better than wooden spoons but I don't like them!,"In every objective way these spoons are better than the wooden spoons you have always used. They handle risotto as gently as any wooden spoon and the rice doesn't stick to them; they clean up easily in the dishwasher; they do not stain; they are nonporous; in short they are a significant improvement over wood and I would recommend them to any commercial kitchen.So what's the problem? They are not wood and they do not look or feel right to me! I am a traditionalist and enjoy my old-fashioned cast iron and enameled cast iron. My kids, who enjoy cooking in T-Fal, would love these. Just not for me. I'm buying a new set of wooden spoons."
1,Not thrilled!,"Yes, they're red & beautiful, but I need more from kitchen utensils, like not having to peel off pieces of nylon that come loose at the edges."
5,Love them!,These spoons are so nice. The strength is a nice change from all those wooded spoons I've used over the years. The red color is perfect for my kitchen too. My wooden spoons are now in the trash.
3,They're PINK!,"Great spoons, but yes, they're PINK!Highly disappointed in the color, since I have a strong aversion to pink, but they're good spoons nonetheless.Knocked off 2 stars for the color, otherwise would have given 5 stars."
2,Makes annoying rattling sound,"The ""feet"" of the napkin stand are uneven. It rocks at a high frequency any time the table it sits on is bumped. It is extremely annoying, to the point where I'm looking for another napkin holder that holds napkins in place."
4,Great for the price,"I thought this set was great for the price and a good starter set. I had these knives a couple of years ago and have since upgraded to the Wusthof Classic. The Silverpoint knives are lighter and ""flimsier"" than the professional lines for a reason - the cheaper knives are stamped by machine, mostly made in China. The professional knives are made in Germany and the steel is forged, giving them the heavier, more balanced feel. You can't expect top of the line knives for $60. If your biggest concern is price over quality, this set will serve you well enough until you are ready to shell out more for a better set."
3,"""Silverpoint"" knives are not forged","When I tried to research the ""Silverpoint"" knives, the following was the only information that was readily available,""Wusthof Trident's Silverpoint line of household knives and tools resembles the Grand Prix style of handle. The smaller Silverpoint line consists of primarily tools, and a small selection of knives where the heft and expense of forging may not be required. The knives from this family are not forged.""These knives are much lighter that I would have expected. They arrived very sharp and so far, have held their edge nicely. My old kitchen knives were falling apart, but I wasn't ready to spend the money to get a set of the Grand Prix or the Classic. I was looking for a set of okay kitchen knives. These knives will be a good transition. I can slowly purchase the Grand Prix one at a time and put them in this block."
1,Cheap Knives Should Not Be Sold As Wusthof,"The Silverpoint knives may look good in the pictures, but they are NOTHING like the quality of the Wusthof Grand Prix knives. The weight is about a third of the same Grand Prix knife. The blades are flimsy and they don't have the same balance as the more expensive quality Wusthof lines. The Silverpoint knives are stamped and not forged like the other Wusthof knives. I ended up donating my Silverpoint set to Salvation Army, and bought another set - Grand Prix this time - to get the quality I was looking for. Do yourself a favor -- save your money and use whatever knives you currently have until you can afford to buy a Classic or Grand Prix set. Even at the $69.99 Amazon price, they are not a good deal!!!!"
1,Be Very Cautious,"I purchased these knives as a present for my mother. She has always used cheap faberware knives and I thought she would enjoy having some decent cutlery. The Wusthof Silverpoint will not meet this goal. I purchased these thinking I would get a mid-grade knife set, but they are poor at best. I'm am returning these and I'm very disappointed with this experience. The knives are extremely sharp, however they are so light and flimsy that they are a safety hazard. I have ""good"" knives, but I did not have lofty expectations for these, as I expect many people do. The handles on the Silverpoints look cheaper than any brandname knife I have ever seen. Please consider something else, there are far better products for the same or lower price."
3,Cut Above . . .,"I had no expectations when I purchased my Wüsthof set. Granted, I'm upgrading from a Farberware set I received 8 years ago and I thank God that set lasted so long, so my opinion is not as valid as long-term Wüsthof users. However, I am pleased with this set. It's not as solid as the Classic series and not nearly as coveted, but for the price? Snatch it up and upgrade slowly, it'll be well worth the use you get out of it in the meantime. And at $49.99, buy a set for your local soup kitchen."
1,wusthof knife set not stain resistant,at first the knives were good..after 1 month use they developed rust and stains eventhough we hand washed them...handle is plastic and not very ergonomic..not worth it!
2,"THE 6"" FORK IS NOT INCLUDED","I DID NOT RECEIVE THE 6"" FORK WITH MY SET (INSTEAD I GOT TWO 4527 KNIVES (16CM AND 20 CM). I AM BEING FORCED TO PAY $49.99 FOR A FORK SINCE I THREW AWAY THE BOX.NOT ONLY COUNT THE PIECES, BUT MAKE SURE IT IS WHAT YOU WERE OFFERED"
5,Incredible,This is a must have book for all ages. Breathtaking illustrations used to show the importance of the natural world. A must buy.
5,An amazing book,This is one of the greatest books for kids. That is if you want some spirituality in your kids life.
2,"good idea, but not impressed","I bought this for my 20 month old twins and they don't care for it at all. I don't either. It's just a little too touchy, feely, hippie, new agey for me. The illustrations are well done, but they honestly remind me of one of those 3D art prints that you have to stare at or squint your eyes to see the hidden unicorn or whatever. Many people also said that it helped teach their kids how to respect the earth...which I am all for, but this book really doesn't do that either. Maybe when my kids are older, I'll give it another shot. Still, the animal illustrations are very good, and I appreciate the sentiment, but overall...it doesn't cut it"
4,classic women writer,"Alice Munro was one of those author's whose name I kept hearing and seeing and yet I never seemed to read. I finally picked up Open Secrets and am now desperate to collect her other stories and novels. Though definitely geared toward women-readers, as all the stories in this collection include women and girls as main characters, anyone who enjoys someone like Margaret Atwood or Jane Hamilton will enjoy Munro."
2,Not helpful,"I was looking for a book to learn about the DISC tool and to be able to interpret the results of a test, something I could use to train others. This was not helpful. I also purchased the sister book about teams, and that was almost exactly the same as this one. Don't buy both. The same charts were present with VERY minor changes. I don't recommend this book."
4,Good for retail,I gave the tests to the managers in my store and showed how each of us had different working personalities and what we needed to do to be able to work togther better.
2,almost good but not quite,"This is another one of those annoying movies where the men fornicate with everything that moves and the women who love these schmucks are depicted as shrill and clingy for being upset about it. But when the man gets totally unhinged by evidence of the woman's infidelity this is somehow powerful and emotional. I really wish that Hollywood would stop perpetuating this insulting double standard.Adrian Brody was somehow compelling as the tritely written ""criminal with the soul of a poet"". There were a few moving scenes that made the movie worth watching (""I hate you""..""I know"") and some some of the other love scenes were touching and realistic as well. Pam Grier was great, as were a number of the other minor roles.Overall, a disappointment but with a few transcendent scenes."
5,AMAZING!!!,"I loved this movie!!! I just saw it last night and I could stop watching!!! I love movies where theres a tough guy who falls for the good girl!!! Jack and Claire were an amazing couple who were truely in love with each other, even though their relationship wasn't healthy, they were in love!!! The acting was great and I've know girls like Claire and boys like Jack, so I've seen what can happen to both people in that situation!!! Although it hit close to home I can't wait to see it again!!!"
1,"Promises more than 90% unfulfilled, alas","Ninety-three pennies and one dime yielded a spin in 6 cases. No deviations in insertion technique observable. I guess after the fourth spin, it did become a game to see whether you could get at least one more...SPIN BANK by Fascinations (Colors May Vary)but I will return it since I have a couple of other things to send back too. Otherwise, the postage wouldn't be worth it since the ""spinbank"" is only a few bucks."
3,okay.,"Bought this for my son who loves interesting banks to save his $. It was fun to see coin spin when you put it in bank but it requires the right ""push"" through slot to make this happen. Push too hard or soft and coin just falls flat. Pretty good for price."
1,My kids room is cuter,"I thought just about all the rooms were just so-so. There was no organization or any one theme. Nothing really flowed. These just looked like any kids room, with random hodge podge decoration. This book is worth a peak but only if it is at the bookstore or if one of your friends has it."
3,BEWARE OF SAME BOOK DIFFERENT TITLE,"I have not read the book yet so, my rating of the contents page is average so far. I wanted everyone to know that this book is a reprint of the book by the same author titled ""The Pleasures of Their Company: An Owner's Guide to Parrot Training [Hardcover]. Don't make the same mistake I made and order both. Some sellers will not allow a return or exchange and they don't return your emails. Buyers beware."
4,Parrots,"The only comment I have is to point out that this title is exactly the same book as the following:The Pleasures of Their Company: An Owner's Guide to Parrot TrainingDifferent title, different ISBN ... exact same text..."
5,GREAT BOOK,This is a great book dealing with parrot training. People can find any information for various problems relating to parrot behaviorism.
3,It is a repeat book,"Under a new name, and that is why it gets only 3 stars.Apart from that it is a well written, intereesting, book, for parrot keepers."
5,Excellent book for Februay- Black History Month,I read this book to my 1st grade students to teach them about Harriet Tubman and the Underground Railroad. The illustrations were nice and my students caught on that they were really following the constellation (the dipper). I would highly recommend this book. It was THE BEST resource I could find to tie into Black History Month.
1,Poor Illustrations,"I have used this book and video in my music classes for years. After retiring, I lost my book and thought to replace it with this one advertised on Amazon. Please don't waste your money! The pictures in this booklet are so dark, dim, blurry (almost impressionistic), and faded, that I won't be able to share it with my classes (even small groups). One would guess it to be a ""knock-off"" of the real book. Perhaps the original publisher should be notified. I will now be looking for the original hardback. Again..........don't waste your time or money."
2,Harbor Freight,"This item gets fairly good reviews from woodworkers, although I don't own it myself. You can get this directly from a Harbor Freight store with a 20% off coupon for about $135 plus sales tax while avoiding the high cost of shipping."
1,Broke after only a week,This scale seemed to work great at first. Then after a week it was saying I weighed 50 pounds more or less than I actually do. After a few days of that it quit working completely (not due to low battery). I have not contacted the company yet but I hope to get a full refund.
2,Not Worth Money,"This product was easy to set up, and the scale portion works well. However, those are the only positives.The body fat percentage of the scale does not work. I get different readings each time I step on the scale. One of the reasons why I bought this was because it has an athletic mode, which corrects for the high muscle mass of athletes. Being a collegiate division one athlete, my muscle percentage is higher than that of a normal person. The batteries were also not included, so that added extra expenses.Overall, it was not worth the money I spent on it. If you are an athlete that want accurate readings, do not buy this scale."
1,not accurate? NOT EVEN APPROXIMATE!!,"Some days this scale will read the same WHATEVER you put on it.I can step on it with or without shoes, holding books, with wet hair: it reads exactly the same. The next day the same conditions will produce an eight pound increase or a five pound decrease.I think I'd get more accurate results by pulling a number out of a hat!Please don't waste your money.I am on [...] today, because I am shopping for a different scale. You should too...."
1,Huge disappointment,"Two 20 lb dumbbells weigh 42.5 lbs according to this scale...most of the time, but not always, occasionally they weigh 41 or 42 or 40 lbs. As the weight increases so does the discrepancy reaching 4.5 pounds for the weight of 150-200 lbs. Enough said."
5,Terrific scale for a great cause!,I have been looking to purchase a new bath scale for a little while now and have looked to Amazon to help offer me the choice to search through different brands. I found this scale and when I compare it with other body fat scales- well- this one has great features and is much less in cost! Now throw in that it comes from a company willing to support breast cancer research and it was a no brainer for me. Thanks Amazon for carrying this product and thanks Taylor for offereing to support the cause.
2,More of a Never-could-really-happen book,"I figure this book is for the person who is needing a little bit of spice in there night.This sexy novel is lacking in point and reality, and only makes any sence at all when clothes have been torn off. There are many great sexy hot novels out there...I wouldnt recomend this one unless you really have nothing better to do."
4,This book is not out of print!,"Although the description above states that this issue of Flames Across the Border is out of print, it fails to add that it was re-issued in August of 2001 by Anchor Canada. Its ISBN is 0385658389. Amaazon.ca stocks it. So if you want to read this very good book, you still can, without searching for used copies."
3,"Great Performance, Poor Sound","Erich Kleiber, father of Carlos, was truly one of the great conductors of the 20th Century. This disc features live recordings of Beethoven -- the 4th Symphony with the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam from 1950, and the 5th Symphony and the Egmont Overture with the NBC Symphony Orchestra from 1948. The performances are quite impressive but the mono sound is rather poor with noticeable tape hiss, not to mention plenty of coughing and throat-clearing from the audience. The Urania label advertises a number of rare historical recordings, but I have yet to find one that warrants its price tag, considering the sound quality. Other labels like Testament, Dutton, Naxos Historical, and even Classica D'Oro offer a consistently better product. And if what you want is a high quality disc of Erich Kleiber conducting Beethoven, get the Decca Legends disc of the 3rd and 5th Symphonies."
4,Carpet slides are great!,"Great idea! My son had a blast sliding on the carpet for weeks after Christmas. One strap has ripped, but I believe I will be able to sew it and he can continue to slide away."
2,Fun Slides + Child = Disaster Waiting to Happen!,"Fun Slides, it sounds like a neat idea but trust me it is the worst product out there. It is a disaster waiting to happen. My daughter got a pair for Christmas and has been fun sliding around the house until the other day when the strap on one of her slides broke and she lost balance into our living room window. Yup, we are the proud new owners of a broken window, 9 stitches on a kid and two hefty bills from the hospital and the contractor who had to come out and fix our window. WHAT FUN! (eye roll) Save yourself some trouble and take that child roller or ice skating instead."
3,Not quite like his other books,"I read this guy's other book, Anguished English, and had a lot of fun with it. It was a collection of situations where bad English was used in hilarious ways.I thought that Get Thee To A Punnery would be more of the same, except with puns.Instead I got a book full of blank spots where you guess the best word to make the sentence a pun.It might be fun for some people, but I really just kind of wanted a joke book of sorts for myself. There are some good puns in there actually listed, and it appears to be a good way to make yourself more aware of how to have pun with the language.But if you're already good at making people groan, then you probably won't need it for this purpose."
2,Impossible answer section,"The pun tests, mostly match the word with the idea, or match beginnings and endings of puns, just doesn't work with the Kindle. The answers are given but without the original question so you have to flip back and forth from text to answer section. Also, the book is really skimpy, listing mostly old, known puns and very little new. Even those who are not punsters will not find enough to justify the price. Sorry, save your money."
4,Practically worthy of a 21-pun salute,"Sorry, but I couldn't resist that title. Richard Lederer's Get Thee to a Punnery: An Anthology of Intentional Assaults Upon the English Language is neither a footnote-heavy treatise on literary puns through the ages (although he quotes a few from Shakespeare). Neither is it a collection of groan-inducing puns (although it has a few of those as well).Instead, Lederer takes a middle ground of sorts and breaks puns down into a number of categories. Strange, but I had never thought of puns as being anything but a low form of humor before. It's like finding out your crazy old uncle who was forever trying to get you to ""pull my finger"" had once been the Royal Court Jester.I could have probably done without some of the exercises in the book which seemed like unnecessary padding. But that's just my preference. The rest of the book made for an enjoyable and fairly quick read."
3,"If you like puns, good. If not, meh","This book was not nearly as good as Anguished English. For people who get a kick out of puns, it's great, but otherwise, don't bother. It is mostly a list of ""complete the pun."" If you don't like that kind of thing, it is a waste of money. If you do, it is gold. I don't so I don't rate it very high."
2,Look inside is misleading,This book is padded with tests and quizes. It took less than 1 hour to go through without doing the tests.When I 'looked inside' all I saw was a presentation of the topic and none of the tests. If you want to be tested $0.99 isn't a bad price but I was expecting a more detailed book on puns.
3,Good for teenagers or younger,"The product was not packaged well.It was just thrown in a ring box, so over the coarse of shipping, it became very, very tangled.I was able to get all but one knot out. It definitely should have come packaged like necklaces usually do with some sort of backing/stand so that it wouldn't tangle during shipment.Also, it has a very cheap chain. It's what you would expect for the price I paid, but I did expect better from the Amazon Curated Collection."
1,Wishbone hanger way bigger than Dogeared,"It was advertised very sneaky, right between all the dogeared products. I thought it was Dogeared as well. The wishbone is too big - you can't tell from the picture."
4,Not sterling silver!,"*UPDATED REVIEW*When I initially reviewed this necklace, I was misunderstanding things a bit. The packaging of this necklace said the product was rhodium plated and I assumed I was paying for a piece of jewelry that potentially wasn't sterling silver. What I didn't know was that rhodium-plating is actually used on stuff like sterling silver, white gold and platinum because it adds brightness, shine and resistance to tarnish! Which is an added bonus, but it might be something to consider adding to the product description as a potential selling point so people who don't do their research don't make fools of themselves. :)This necklace is very beautiful and the person I got it for loved it!"
2,Disappointed in quality of chain.,I was very disappointed in the quality of the chain. Pendant is very nice. Will think again prior to buying jewelry online.
2,Marginal,I bought this for myself when it was on sale. It did not meet my expectations - much less 'elegant' than it looked in the photo.
3,Reviews misleading,I just received the necklace in a padded envelope........very different from the video review by Christine. Not sure of the quality yet. It is a gift. I will let you know.
5,Pretty little necklace,"This necklace is so cute and pretty. I got it for my sister for Christmas, and she loves it. I might buy it for myself."
5,Looks just like the picture!,"Yes, the chain was a little tangled when I got it, but I've been wearing it for weeks now and have found it to be very durable. The wishbone is very pretty and unique. It is as pretty as it is in the picture, perfectly shaped and shiny. I'm very pleased with this purchase. It was specially priced as a lightning deal before Christmas. I bought it to give as a gift, and after seeing it, kept it for myself!"
3,Whisbone pendant,"I saw a similar chain in a movie and really liked the look. The pendant is pretty, just a little larger than I though it would be. I wanted small and dainty (about a dime size in length) and this ended up being about a nickel size in length. Still a nice look and I can wear alone or as a layering chain."
5,Awesome,This was better than expected! Both the chain and the pendant were beautiful and perfect in size! Just amazing and the length of the chain was perfect too.
5,Classic and Unique,I love this necklace! it arrived a few days ago and I couldn't wait to open it. I didn't think it would looked nice when I purchased it. When I opened it I was blown away the picture doesn't explain how beautiful this necklace looks. Its Unique and not original and that is the reason why I bought it because I didn't want a necklace that has a heart or anything original. I don't regret getting this and I recommend it to anyone that wants a necklace that is unique and classic.
3,Good buy!,"I bought a few of these as a cheaper bridesmaids gift because I got them numerous things. It is very lightweight and cute. I do not like the ""made in China"" on the inside of the wishbone, it is a bit tacky. But you get what you pay for. Overall a good purchase for the price."
4,Nice,"The silver charm is really sturdy, but the chain is a tad weak. And I bought this for my best friend shes kinda petite, so the chain did hang a little too low for our tastes, but just read the measurements on it to make sure youre happy with it."
4,Simple and Nice design - The chain is very dainty,"I got this for a friend, and I'm sure she'll love it. Although the chain is very, very dainty - The pendant hole is large enough where she could opt for a larger necklace if she chooses. So that's nice.It's very pretty necklace. Well worth the money!"
4,nice gift,"Got this as a birthday gift for a friend. The quality is very good and doesnt feel cheap, the wishbone has a nice feel. Would highly recommend this to anyone!"
5,Wishbone Pendant,Ordered this pendant as I had one when younger and lost it. Quality is very good and at a good price.
3,looks good,"Chinese!!!!! OMG!!!! I couldn't believe it when I saw it...light and looks nice, I wear it all the time and keeps the shiny look"
4,Nice,"The wishbone is pretty big, so pay attention to the size, but other than that it is very nice. The chain is very thin and tangles easily. I would recommend a colored cord instead of the chain for both practical and aesthetic reasons."
3,it's ok,"chain is flimsy and knots very easily, wishbone portion is clunky and hollow, larger than what i expected but should have expected for the price."
2,"Nice pendant, wimpy chain","I think I waited about 3 weeks to get this necklace, and I was excited when I received it. However, on the 2nd day of wearing it, the chain broke, so now I have to purchase a new chain for it. The pendant is too heavy for the chain, so I suggest for amazon to upgrade the chain or stop selling this item with a wimpy chain."
1,Popped the first day I wore it,I didn't even have it on for an hour and the chained popped. All I did was get into the car!
2,What I wish about my wishbone,"The wishbone pendant is what I thought it would be, but the clasp on the chain is so tiny I can't get it to work. So now I just wish I could wear my wishbone, but I can't."
3,Cute,"Chain came a tangled mess, and continued to tangle every time it touched itselfThe sterling silver was really very pretty, and the necklace looked really niceIf only the chain wasn't such a painIts INCREDIBLY thin and gets caught up in itself like no otherand the fine-ness makes it hard to unknot"
5,Love it!!!,"This wishbone necklace is even more beautiful than the picture.My friend recently bought one in New York and I've wanted one since I saw it. Originally, I was a little concerned about the quality of the product since the price was so low, but when I received it, I was thrilled. It's better looking than the one from New York...and for way less money!"
5,AN ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE!!,"My daughters and I have begun the ""Wishbone Sisterhood"" within our circle of friends and family...this has become a very special symbol for all of us. I ordered five previously and am now ordering more. Compliments abound all the time about this...everyone loves it and wants to know where they can get one.Start your own sisterhood -- because dreams DO come true!"
3,wishbone,"The necklace arrived very quickly and it was just as described however the chain was heavily knotted which was a pain to undo. Otherwise, nice item."
5,Absolutely Wonderful Pendant,"I finally ordered this pendant after keeping it bookmarked for months. I am very satisfied with it. I receive lots of compliments on it, it is simple yet elegant and very noticeable. It has a lovely size, proportional without being gaudy. The chain is thin, of course, but accents the pendant nicely. Overall, a perfect look for a young woman."
4,so cute,This necklace arrived quickly and just how it appears online. It has a clean and simple design but definitely stands out - I've gotten many compliments on it!
5,Buy this,"Cool fish! Awesome, she loved it! These are my additional fourteen words.I like the word blurg and food because they are good"
5,Great Value,I was impressed with the quality of this necklace. Love it. Compared to other jewelry at this price this was an excellent deal.
4,Perfect every day accessory,"I love this wishbone pendant - just the right size, light but solid. The chain is very thin and is the right length for my decolletage. However, the chain has nickel in it as it causes a rash on my neck if I wear it for too many days in a row. If I didn't have a nickel allergy, I would wear it more often as it is perfect as an every day accessory."
5,Still the best in the last 20 years,I have many Yoga tapes and CD's. This is the very best especially for seniors and beginners.
4,easy for seniors,very easy to follow and understand .most of us can easily do the exercise. I go to senior yoga sponsored by the council of ageing and this is the program she follows.
1,Too much talking,"I got so tired of hearing Lilia talk and bored waiting for the yoga to begin I have quit using the DVD. If she had simply shown how to do the movement, and then quit talking so I could concentrate I would have enjoyed it more."
1,Lilias! am & pm workouts,gave it one star because there's not a lower score. such a disappointment. don't waste your money
3,Yoga for my elderly mother in law,"I gave it 3 stars because I don't know how the recipient liked this gift. I discovered yoga 2 years ago and now I'm addicted. I'm so excited about it, I bought yoga accessories for my in-laws for their birthdays. I bought this video and the yoga mat kit for my 87 year old mother in law. I hoped she liked it."
1,Lilias! AM & PM Yoga Workouts for Seniors,This really seemed like it was for someone who is senile. I really didn't like it at all. I'm donating it.
2,Not recommend !!,"If you can't get up and down to floor easily don't waste your money. I have back issues and can't always move down to the floor and back without pain , so it was my mistake to purchase this DVD but I would advise producers of such programs to put more discription of the programs in the advertising for us people who are handicapped in some ways."
3,Different than I thought,"I had done yoga to Lilias before, though I had not owned one of her tapes. I thought this one would be a brief exercise at bedtime to calm and relax me into a nice sleep. The sessions are longer than I would like, approx. 35 min. give or take. I have not actually performed the exercises yet; I have to prepare myself for the longer session time. I really did not want to give 35 minutes to this before bedtime, about 15 min. should be enough."
1,Yoga for Very sedentary Seniors should be the title.,I was very disappointed to find this was a sitting yoga practice. It is excellent for elderly or handicapped individuals who need the beneifits of a yoga practice but are physically limited to the point they need to be seated for the session.I wish I could get my money back so I could order a more sutiable yoga tape.
5,Great for all sedentary people looking to increase mobility!,"I am not a ""senior"" but have many health issues, including arthritis and obesity. I need to increase my flexibility and mobility, but all the other yoga dvds I looked at were too difficult in my present condition. I have only been using the dvd for four days, but feel like I have already increased my flexibility a bit. I have done both the AM and PM versions, but not been able to finish either --yet! -- but have gotten a little farther each time.Highly recommended for anyone with mobility issues."
3,am & pm Yoga,only tried it once but seemed slow-will give it another chance to see if I like it better-something new for me.
4,"Good, but definitely for those with movement restrictions",This sequence allows me to use the chair and bed as I am not able to get on the floor. Thank You once again Lilias.
3,"well made, but description is misleading","the product description claims it is adjustable to 4, 6 or 8"" - i took that to mean it could fit 8"" railings, which it doesn't (like all the other products i looked at, it only adjusts to max. 6""). otherwise, it is nice-looking and sturdy. you get extra screws and it is very easy to install."
4,energizer ftw - but...,"we are professional photographers and use these batteries in our pocket wizard mini tt1 triggers. they are great batteries, but i'm honestly not convinced they are any better or worth more $$ than those ones you buy on amazon in the 25 pack."
5,SPECTACULAR price!,"I paid less for 12 of these Energizer batteries than I did for ONE at the local drug store(last resort)! They work just as you would expect an Energizer to work, great!"
3,"Big, not for smaller workspace!","Comfort wise, GREAT! Space wise, awful! This is good for a bigger desk workspace, but I have a small slide out shelf and the platform from front to back is bigger than the shelf. I have to pull the shelf out as far as it'll go to have room to work the mouse. It leaves a very small space for the mouse itself, which means the wrist pillow I bought for the mouse won't fit anywhere on side of it at all. The maker should have added another 3inches and the mouse could have fit on it too. What makes it bad is that, this is not the one I ordered, actually Amazon sent me the wrong one. I ordered a smaller one along with a wrist pillow for my mouse since I have carpal tunnel. I don't feel like dealing with my not so good running vehicle and the heat trying to go through all the hassel of returning it and going without the wrist support any longer. Bottom line, if you're working with a smaller workspace this is not a good pick."
5,perfect,I'm a law student and I'm on my computer constantly. I have a wireless keyboard and a wireless mouse with mousepad on this and it's the best! My wrists/hands are never tired after a long day of typing!
4,Keyboard tray,I really like this product and the price. I have one at home and I also bought one for the office.
1,this book really stinks,I really didn't think this book helped at all. I thought that it was a walk through telling you how to beat the game but it just tells you some things.
4,"funny, freaky, well worth a watch","I saw this at a UK film festival and loved it. There were points that were gross enough and tense enough to keep my attention, and bits of light relief also - a good balance - and considering the comparable low budget of this film it is well worth a watch by anyone who loves their horror - or anyone wanted to try something a little bit different to your typical torture/gore film."
2,General Info Only,This book was a disappointment. This is a very brief overview of the hobby of collecting farm toys. This is not a resource book.
4,"tight fit, but nice","fits kinda tight into cig lighter, but works well once it's in there. I like the fact that it swivles to an angle, that's a nice feature in a tight spot."
5,Spirit Filled Life Bible Study Series - Redemption and Restoration,The service from Amazon was amazing - this book is out of print and you connected me with lots of used book dealers. I was able to find enough copies from different dealers and their service was also excellent. I have received all the copies I needed and they are all like brand new and just about $5.00 each including shipping and handling. The $30.00 credit I received by applying for the Chase Amazon Credit Account meant a very BIG savings for me. Thanks! I will be using Amazon again and will not hesitate to recommed Amazon.com.
1,Speakers won't fit.,"Purchased this pod along with some polk 5.25"" speakers. The hole is too small for the speaker, not even close."
3,"Won't fit all models, use caution....","The product description says ""The Centra-Pod fits 76-95 CJ and Wrangler models."" Don't believe it! I have a 1978 CJ-7, with a T-18 transmission. There's no room for this item between the shifter and the heater outlet. I wish it would fit, as it is a well-made item. They do have some vague measurements in the description as to what is needed for fitment, but they have them as guidelines for ""earlier models""."
1,Not helpful,This is a very extensive dictionary but offers no help with pronunciation and sentence structure. The font is very small making it hard to look things up and read. The spelling is confusing and inconsistent. Many of the definitions are incorrect.
4,"Lakota Dictionary: Lakota-English / English-Lakota, New Comprehensive Edition (Multilingual Edition)","I would tell folks that there is ""No Slack"" here. It is Exactly what it says it is, a Multilingual Translation Dictionary.There is a section you will need to read on Syntax. As is normal to anyone who has ""dipped"" into a Language, other than their own, know that Masculine/Feminine, 1st, 2nd and 3rd person, tense and plurals, are always difficult.I have the Honor of having a penpal of the Lakota Nation. When writing I usually attempt a paragraph in Lakota. This book usually gives me acceptable results. But I do have the luxury of having my attempts kindly corrected if need be!So, ""No Bones About It"" it is like having a Giant version of those little ""Get You By"" Language Phrase books you take on vacation with you. Okiya {Peace}"
1,A disgrace,"It is really surprising that anyone would buy this dictionary, now that the New Lakota Dictionary exists. Many years ago I was interested in Lakota, read through this dictionary and found the orthography so confusing I did not even try to learn it seriously. It cannot be blamed on the author Buechel, who made an important contribution to the description of Lakota during the first half of the twentieth century. The editor, Manhart, is really responsible for the sorry state of this dictionary. Not only is the orthography confusing and illegible, many words are wrongly transcribed and were never rechecked with native speakers. Whatever your interest in the Lakota language may be, do not buy this dictionary !"
4,"Emphasis on drama, not science fiction","This book should not be classified as science fiction. The science fiction aspect is only the means to teach the painful lesson that possessing exceptional skills -- even of superhuman proportions -- is not enough to bring the owner a successful life. Without direction on how to use them to the best advantage, the skills can not only be nonproductive, but counterproductive. In this book, the protaganist's superhuman strength brings him only humiliation and villification. So much good he can do for himself and the world. But how? I'm sure there are many talented people who can relate to this tragic hero. Philip Wylie's Gladiator has receive too few accolades."
3,Another good what-if novel by Philip Wylie,"This was the first book I read from this author . It was a realistic account of what would really happen to a superhuman ( Someone capable of easily lifting 4000 lbs ) if he were placed among us mortals . Thoughtfully written - typical of Wylie's style , it took you through the life and events of such a person - mainly how other people would react to him and his difficulty to blend in with the human race (everyone was inferior to him). Philip Wylie also showed , in his own philosophical style , how nature dealt with something that was not natural or belonged here . It is a book I will never forget and I felt for the main character . After reading this I realized that Philip Wylie was no ordinary author and I discovered this through his other books . It is a shame that many of them are out of print . Most of the stuff he writes is profound - not like today's pulp fuction best sellers ."
1,I Wouldn't Go Here...,"I purchased this software, hoping to experience the opportunity to design some slick personal calling cards. What I got instead was a migraine! The design backgrounds are GORGEOUS, but you have to have a PHD in graphic design to make this software work. I spent hours trying to make my chosen design fit within the print area of my standard Avery cardstock - I don't claim to be the brightest crayon in the box, but I'm pretty intelligent and resourceful and I wasn't able to do anything with it. I'm glad I only spent [amt]. If you have the a lot of extra time and an unending supply of patience, give it a shot - If you don't choose another product, or go to Kinko's."
1,shoulda listened...,"I found this software to be user unfriendly, plus it required downloading a patch to print from an HP Deskjet 670C printer (oh, that's right- an obscure model nobody else has). Anyone without internet access would have been SOL.There are some nice templates but any attempts to customize or edit font styles crashed my system beyond ctrl/alt/del. I sent an e-mail to the support desk, since no phone number was provided anywhere. That was last week and I've still had no response. I was going to make my husband some nice cards for Christmas- but I bought him a new coffee maker instead.I think the multi-star ratings here must be from company reps. I am very dissatisfied with this software."
5,The #1 Item for Starting Businesses,"When you receive your 20,000 Business Cards, you may think you been had. But this product is one of the best business starters around. If you have recently opened a new business, ths product is for you. No more flimsy paper business cards. Professional looking, colorful, unique cards will result from your hard work and this product. With the clipart included, you can not only make personalized cards, but also neat word processing projects. This proves that this product is not only perfect for entrepenuers, but anyone else who appreciates the value of creativity and self-expression. This is a great product that deserves a look. You should grab this product off the shelf today. Anything else would be worse than a pencil through the neck, and I'm not allowed to speak of it in this review."
1,Beware! this stuff will crash you Windows 95 installation,"I bought this software and installed it on my machine. Every time I tried to use it, it crashed my system so hard it wouldn't even respond to ALT+CTRL+DEL. I was never able to print even a single business card."
3,Just Ok,"I did like Clint and Terri, but Melissa, Jillianne, and Mark (Malcolm) got in the way of a really great story. It is sad that women (fictional or not) cannot find good men that they have to fall in love with the one that appeared to not love them back. I like Ms. Hill's style she's a real story-teller, but after a while I was truly annoyed with the lack of realism. No cell phones? And not being able to trust each other, they (Clint & Terri) professed their love for one another, and yet because they lived in the world of this is too good to be true they believed the worst in each other--that for me was the hardest part to get over. Love never hurts."
3,Ok but not her best,Overall it was a good book but it did take a long time to get to the point at the end. I wasn't disappointed after reading it.
2,MASS CONFUSION,"I ENJOYED THIS BOOK BUT, IT TOOK A LITTLE TOO LONG FOR THE LEAD CHARACTERS TO FIGURE OUT THAT THE PEOPLE THAT THEY LEAST SUSPECTED TO COMMIT ALL OF THE WRONG DOING IN THIS BOOK WERE GUILTY. THEY WERE BOTH JUST A LITTLE TOO NAIVE TO MY LIKING. IF THESE WOMEN WERE THAT CUT THROAT IN THE BUSINESS WORLD, HOW COULD THEY BE SO TAKEN IN AS TO NOT CHECK THE REFERENCES OF SOMEONE SO HIGH UP IN YOUR BUSINESS AS TO PRACTICALLY BE RUNNING IT."
1,Too heavy -not warm enough,"Bought this for my kids who needed a warm, light sleeping bag for occasional camping trips. They can't fit the bag into or on top of their backpacks and it weighs a ton. I've learned my lesson - cheap means cheap."
4,Model Railroading in Small Spaces,This is an excellent overview of what is involved with setting up and running a layout in limited space. The author gives plenty of options and details of what is involved without preaching. I've read seven books on the topic and this was by far the easiest reading.
5,Better deal for cats,I buy the six-pack of WildSide Salmon dog treats for my cats as it's cheaper than the WildSide Salmon cat treats. Every once in a while I'll have to break a chunk into smaller pieces but for the most part they are the same easily managed sized chuncks of dried salmon. My cats love WildSide so much they think they're supposed to have some with every meal. The bags open easily and stay closed with the built-in resealing zipper keeping the salmon fresh. Good stuff!
2,Only one good track,"The only track I really like on this one is ""Left Side Drive"", which is reminiscent of their older work. Why ""Dayvan Cowboy"" is issued again is beyond me, since it already was totally redundant on ""The Campfire Headphase"". To top that, the remix is even worse than the original.The rest of the album contains mildly interesting noise-drenched synth noodlings, somewhat sounding like their earlier work, but mostly lacking its emotional power.I keep hoping that the Boards will get their act together, but it hasn't happened yet with this EP. Only one decent track out of six is hardly worth it."
4,Boards Of Canada - Trans Canada Highway,"Boards of Canada and ""electric guitar"" aren't words you normally put together, but on their TRANS CANADA HIGHWAY, that's exactly what you get from the get-go. ""Dayvan Cowboy"" is like a soundtrack to a futuristic Wim Wenders film; the country-western vibe might put some people off, but for me, it's an added bit of charm. ""Left Side Drive"" is more familiar territory for the Boards, a dreamy and drifting track. ""Skyliner"" continues in that vein, with its long sci-fi synths and scattered rhythms. Odd Nosdam takes a slow, droning approach to his remix of ""Dayvan Cowboy,"" such that want originally sounds like a road trip turns into a head trip."
4,Still whishing...,"Nice, BoC style, interesting, neo-hippy, psychedelic, now I would wish they could overgrow their concept of having a beat that has some similarity to drums, esp. TRish sound we know for so long... and also quite classic slow clubbish beats...Give us real ambient without the annoying beats... Provide rhythmic structures with other elements, not with electro drums - that would be something really new and exciting from them.Anyway - ok album.But there are many less known artists that more mature than BoC and would deserve even more recognition - like Keith Fullerton Whitman, Tim Hecker, Fennesz and many more."
4,BOC has yet to dissapoint me......,"I'm not sure what all the grumbling was about concearning Campfire, and I'm sure there's probably some to come for this release. Perhaps we have hit a fork in the road where the true BOC fans continue down the BOC path, while the other's sit content with thier Turquoise Hexigon Sun, Roygbiv, and Iced Cooley's. Personally, I thought Campfire was a highpoint in BOC's career. This is a wonderful release as well, but as good as it is, its sometimes hard to compare a single to an album. However, BOC did do a nice job of giving the single a different vibe than the album as a whole presented. Left Side Drive is particularly impressive."
5,Great Cd,"I thought that this cd was an excellent BOC release. I am a huge fan of Boards and the new track ""Skyliner"" is awesome. I have also heard some complaints of Dayvan Cowboy. I am not sure what people are hearing here, but I think its a great song. Just give it a second listen. Bottom line...great couple new tracks. Sure, I would like the album to be longer due to the fact that I'm a huge Boards fan...but for now these are great tracks and a nice album to follow up to Campfire."
5,Magnificent collection of Olivia's work,This is a beautiful over sized book with over 100 of the best of Olivia. The reproduction quality and paper quality are amazing. A must buy for any lover of pin-up art or Vargus.
3,Provocative but ultimately unfullfilling...,"Sort of like most affairs, eh? There's no doubt this is an easy book to read and full of steamy details about married women fed up with their lives or just plain bored who decide to try something new. I was engrossed in their stories and the women did not let me down. Unfortunately, the author did. I had hoped for more analysis precisely because she seemed to be promising that in the very first chapter. She never came through and what could have been a much more important book ultimately, I think, failed. Too fluffy, not enough substance."
2,Fake stories or so laughingly bad written accounts.,"Her interviews with cheating wives were written in the authors own interpretations. (which she writes like bad Harlequin novels) For example: The 'Doctor' affair cannot be true, no Dr would invite a new patient with an emergency knife cut wound into an empty office after hours and then attempt to seduce the married patient with lines like ""leave your blouse open we are casual here"" or ""one man's pain is another man's pleasure"" with a leering grin, can you say Malpractice suit? The other stories are all just as bad/fake and there is never any conclusion to the question on the title why do wives cheat, what is the purpose of the book? This is just boring stories of desperate house-wife wannabees that may or may not have actually happened, not a self help or informal non-fiction."
1,"What's sauce for the goose may be sauce for the gander, but both end up getting cooked","The subtitle may be ""Why More Wives are Unfaithful"", but don't be fooled -- this book offers no real insight whatsoever, just a parade of stupid, sad, sordid tales of selfish, oblivious women with no moral center. Turns out women cheat for exactly the same reasons men do -- they're a--holes. Forget about buying this book -- it was barely worth the effort to check it out of the library for free."
1,Undressing Infidelity - Not,I was looking for more of an analytical approach to infidelity. This book was based on anecdotal evidence. Women gossiping about their sexual indiscretions. Written in the style of a cheap erotica I feel this book will attract a more feminine audience. I was hoping for the author to dissect each interview in an anthropological fashion. This book has nothing to do with with undressing infidelity. Making a book out of interviews with no research or commentaries makes it hard to believe the author put any effort into writing this book. This book belongs in the soft erotica section at best.
5,A View From The Other Side.,Diane Smith gives a frank and fasinating look into the minds of women at a turning point in their lives. I still don't understand women but they appear to have more in common with men than I ever thought!! Great read.
3,A lot of genres in one...,"Centered around the time prior to, and during WWII this is an interesting mash of several genres and is hard to classify. It pulls together historical-based fiction, a loved and lost and maybe found again story, pitfalls of friendship, clashes of culture and a touch of the supernatural.It's an interesting enough storyline but I found that the characters were very one-dimensional and stereotypical. You like them, but at the end of the story you're quite happy to put the book down, move onto another story and leave them behind.I found that the story didn't really make a lot of impact expect for some complete revulsion generated by the supernatural aspect of the story as it relates to the manner in which this element is released.Really, it's a good story, but it's a nice, light read."
1,Tiny type,I'm a fan of Paul Wilson's books and would like to read this one. Saw a copy of this in the bookstore the other day and was tempted but put it back because it's printed with very VERY small type. It looks like 6 or 7 point type. Way to small for me for a novel of this length. Maybe the next edition will have larger type.
5,Original!!,"One of F. Paul's earliest and most original novels. I've never read anything quite like this. If you'd like to try something very different, but very entertaining you will enjoy it."
2,Another mediocre occult book,"Beware...this book may not be what you're looking for. Its awkwardly used first person style is tedious with many overly long run-on sentences. Liberally laced with four letter words I quickly discovered it's not another end times thriller from a Christian perspective. The author's world view is summed up in his author's note: ""....we are all worshipping the same God without realizing it..."" It led to a story that was disappointing."
3,"FUN, but be sure you get a microphone!","This game is a blast! Just be sure you get a microphone to go with it! I ordered the game thinking that a mic was included. Why call it a ""Bundle"" if it is just the game, right? Be sure you ask your seller if the mic is included, because it probably isn't. I bought mine from a ""New"" listing and no mic!"
3,Gamecube- Karaoke Revolution Party Vol. 4,"This game kept our family singing for hours! The only thing is that we only have one microphone and no dance mat so..... we can't enjoy everything on it. These items are not easy to find for the gamecube. But even so the graphics are exactly the same as the play station and what child doesn't wan't to be a rock star. In fact , what parent's don't want to be a rock star. Overall it's entertaining"
5,Awesome Fun,"This game is a riot. My ten year old duaghter wanted it, but the whole family joins in. This is a lot more fun than regular Karaoke."
5,LET'S GET THE PARTY STARTED!,"This game ROCKS! I highly reccomend this game for everyone. But, before you buy this game you might want to know some things. You can sing 50 songs featuring classic favorites and chart-topping hits which include:American Woman, Brick House, Crazy In Love, Do You Really Want To Hurt Me, Dust In The Wind, Endless Love, Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic, Everybody Wants To Rule The World, Headstrong, Here I Go Again, I Left My Heart In San Francisco, I Love Rock And Roll, Material Girl, Pieces Of Me, Play That Funky Music, Start Me Up, Sweet Caroline, and many more. Also you get to showcase your superstar talent in the sing and dance mode-supports a dance pad controller (sold separately). Play team games, duets, head-to-head battles and mini-games. Put your vocal skills to the test in the KR Challenge. Fully costumize your character's head, body shape, clothes, and accessories. BUY IT SOON!"
4,What's up with that.,"I think the game is so awesome. It is so much fun to be able to have to sing perfectly on the note bar. The only thing that is bad about it is that it doesn't have very many accessories to go with it. Like for the Playstation volume, there are headsets that you can sing in to it, but for the gamecube it just has these very cheap looking microphones. They work well though, and you don't even have to hold down the button on them to sing. That was a huge relief for me. My advice, if you have a Playstation, buy that one instead, but if you just have a Gamecube. Buy it!!! It is one of the coolest games ever. It is so much fun to make your character."
3,Alright DVD,David Carradine's AM and PM Tai Chi workout is much much better. He goes a little fast and doesn't tell you when they are changing positions. You have to do the moves and try to watch the screen at the same time. I was not very impressed with this at all.
5,A great workout for all ages.,"This special video is a great physical workout for people of all ages. It is a beautiful form of low stress exercise that requires no equipment, and can be done anywhere. I have even done it in an airport before boarding a long flight.Robert D. Askren, Ph.D."
3,"Ok, but could be more","The workout is wonderful, and the instructions are very good. I found it very easy to follow the excerizes. I did find it somewhat disappointing in the end, however. While the music is beautiful, it reminded me of what you would find in an elevator. I was hoping for more traditional music in the program. The choice of class members in the background was also somewhat disappointing. Some of them seemed to be only there to push air around and did not seem to have grasped the concept of moving chi energy. I have not watched it since the first time."
2,Get David Carradine's OTHER Tai Chi Workout for Beginners instead,"The one produced by Goldhil Home Media in 1997 is much better at helping you understand Tai Chi. It gives a better overall picture on the overall benefits of Tai Chi, and starts out nice and easy.This DVD, on the other hand, assumes that you're able to pull your leg over your head during the opening Stretching. Plus the 80's spandex doesn't help either."
1,Waste of time and money,"This is without a doubt not for the beginners. I'm not really too sure who it is for. The majority of the camera work stays away from David Carradine and focuses on the class of people that look like 1980s sci-fi rejects. This group of people do the exercises their way and out of sinc with each other and the verbal cues. There is no explaination or demonstration of how to perform the moves being executed, they just start happening. If you look away from the television you will miss something.I could go on about my disappointment with this video. Instead, I will just say don't waste your money on this video and DO NOT buy this video because of a star's name. Look elsewhere for guidance for Tai Chi."
2,This DVD is inferior to VHS version with Tayam,"I am truly disappointed. Streching exercises are for gymnasts (camera shies away from Carradine when unbelievably hard exercises are being done by other participants) and seem to have been borrowed from Pilate or Yoga. The Chinese exercise leader does not know how to lead, just mumbles, and the camera angles and structure of teaching make everything impossible to follow. Unnecessary things like Kung Fu, songs, and other non-Taichi materials should not have been included. I have the older VHS where Arnold Tayam was co-instructor, and I prefer that a lot which I give a B plus. The problem though is that it's the short form. I give this DVD (Natural Journeys production) a grade of D+ (barely passing)."
2,T'a Chi,I found it very difficult to fallow along since you can't always see everything the leader is doing.
1,"maybe ""tai chi for stoners"" would be a more descriptive title","This is a repackaged (and cleverly marketed) recycle from a guy who never learned what he is presenting. Now that he's on the history channel this will probably get attention, but dont be fooled. If people with a casual interest in exercise and affinity for celebrities are motivated by this thats fine, but move on for anyone serious about learning the correct form, look elsewhere. You gotta love those satin pajamas though."
4,Tai chi,I really liked this program. He gives a very good workout of stretches and basic moves before getting into the routine. By far the best Tai Chi program I've seen for beginners and for the slightly advanced too. I recommend.
3,slow workout,"I think it is more of a workout for elderly people. I felt like it was an old video, too."
2,old Star Trek video,"well, the Tai Chi may be ok but the LAME LAME outfits, bad music, 70's hair really detract from the ability to concentrate on the exercise. My wife could hardly stop laughing. Also, not being able to see the feet of the person demonstrating is frustrating. It would be much better if some of the people demonstrating were facing AWAY from the camera as well as towards it so that you aren't trying to mirror what is going on in reverse. Very LAME."
1,Miraculous?,"Maybe I'm jaded but I found most of these stories anything but miraculous. Perhaps ""humdrum"" (NO goosebumps). I gave 1 star because it did prompt me to appreciate the many, many similar experiences in my life. Unless I am some kind of miracle magnet, the point I got from reading this was to appreciate ordinary occurances as ""miracles"", which is not a bad thing. It seemed as if these were stories from the Vissells, their family and their friends (most were from similar professions). I was really hoping for a collection of stories from all corners of the globe, stories that really evoke thoughts of the miraculous and maybe even add to my faith in a benevolent universe. What I got was more of a self-congratulatory marketing piece."
1,Doesn't last well,"This battery worked for about 1.5 years and then stopped delivering power for very long,. It was NOT heavily used. Loses charge in storage conditions. For the money I recommend spending a bit more and getting into lithium ion. I bought a second drill because it included two of them for less than the batteries alone would have cost if purchased separately. Keep you eyes on sales that include lithium ion batteries with some other tool whether you need it or not. They are definitely the way to go."
5,A MUST for DIY people!,"I have a set of these and i tell you, they are all you need for DIY jobs and automotive worksthe standard combination wrench in itself is a blessing as you have two options for removing the bolt. if you need full grip and torque, use the box head, if you need quick turning and accessibility,use the open endbut combining the ratcheting action plus flex head and you have an engineering perfection!Add to the fact that there is an accessory wherein you can turn this into a 1/2, 1/4, 3/8 socket wrench.but take note that because you now have moving parts (flex head and ratchet) this should not be used for very stubborn bolts or over torquing a bolt.the ratchet mechanism is not designed for that much torque (it is not indestructible) you will still need maybe a box wrench (two box head in one) and a power handle to complete the set.for me, buy this one instead of the two ratchet in one, you will still need the open end wrench."
5,Great product!,"I bought this for my elementary aged daughter to help with school products. I love the fact that it is easy to open, twist, use, and cap. Liquid glue isn't for her yet. She has to learn how not to use too much. This product gives her the ability to be creative without mom constantly checking on a messy table."
5,Such a helpful and thorough resource!,"I have a couple of Harris' books, and I must say, so far this one is my favorite in terms of deep, broad information regarding the evolution of human foodways. The content is well cited, explained, and clearly thought-out. In addition to being a scholarly approach to an important universal subject, there are just tons of interesting little tidbits and factoids in here - the kind of things you want to post on Facebook with a ""Did you know...?""I recommend this for anyone studying food history, nutrition, or anthropology."
1,1/5,This album is 1 stars because most of the songs are unlistenable. I don't enjoy listening to this album. I don't recommend this album. Addy.
5,Nightwish's debut album,Angels fall first is far more unique and musically distinguishable from Nightwish's subsequent albums. This album contains much folk elements which sparked off their transcendence in metal in later time.
4,"A Good Debut, But Their Best Comes Later...","I am the proud owner of five Nightwish CDs, all of which I love. I must say however that Angels Fall First is my least favorite of the five. Once, Century Child, Wishmaster, and Oceanborn are all better than Angels Fall First, but I guess that is to be expected; often times bands need to improve upon their first album and refine their sound. Well, Nightwish did just that, and the proof is any of their later releases. Angels Fall First is still essential for the true Nightwish fan though. Get the other four first, and if you still desire more Nightwish, by all means, pick up this title. It's pretty good."
5,5...just,"Wishmaster, Nemo and Oceanborn all rate higher than a five so this just gets a five (let's farget about the horror tha was Century Child). It's a really powerful album although not as classic as the other albums, Tarja stull has a powerful voice especially in Elvenpath and Astral Romance. Get this album. Though if your a newbie then I recommend Wishmaster and Oceanborn first."
4,Good start but not perfect,"I'm going to keep this short and sweet, because I don't play this often enough to do a thorough review. It has many good songs on it, especially the opener and the softer songs, but the lack of a bass guitar and the shabby production are all-too-noticeable. But it's better than Wishmaster, and worlds better than anything you'll find on mainstream."
2,A bad start for an otherwise fantastic band,"If you want to know what exactly Angels Fall First sounds like, let me offer you the following scenario. Combine Wishmaster and Century Child, strip off the bass and half the keyboards, add in some of Simone Simon's extremely forced vocals from Epica and Tuomas's flat tenor, and throw it all into a car crash. That is what Angels Fall First sounds like. I was very disappointed with this first album, especially considering how incredible their other albums were. The two best songs (meaning four out of five stars) were Elvenpath and Know Why the Nightingale Sings, followed by This Moment Is Eternity and Beauty and the Beast. The rest were frankly hard to listen to. Look to Oceanborn and Once for Nightwish's best performances, because you won't find them here."
5,4.5 actually,"first off i not a kid ect. This album is excellent, but the only thing I didnt like was the male vocals, but Tarja's voice is beautiful. Anway except for the male vocals, this was an amazing CD."
3,"Relatively bad, but they improved so much..","Their classic, Oceanborn, comes right after this one. This is just a medicore album. If youre a new fan, stay away! Your money is better spent on the 5 other albums."
4,To Live With Fear Part 1,"I'm a little disappointed in this dvd because there are some missing scenes in the episode of To Live With Fear Part 1. The last two seasons were made with no cuts to it. But it seems that in season 3, they cut out parts. I don't know whats going on. I'm going to try to return it and exchange it at the store and hope that another one doesn't have the same cutouts. I'm hoping that they will have the full episodes. The cutout parts on this episode that I've noticed are ""When Isaiah Edwards is talking to Mary saying that after the operation, she will feel so good she'll want to run all the way home"", and the other part is when ""the guy at the hospital who gets the money from Charles asks to see Caroline"", those two parts are cut out. I hope they fix it. I bought these because they are uncut and have extras as well as not having to tape them off the tv. But the episode I get off the tv has more uncut than the dvd episode does. So I hope that they will do something about it."
1,"First so good, now so terrible","I am the greatest Fan of ""Little House"" and will always be. I liked the quality of the first 2 seasons. The picture was wonderful. But I agree with the rest of all those which are sensitive when it comes to a good picture quality. Since season 3 it stinks. I will not buy ""Little House"" any further unless they will do the next seasons over! I'd rather tape the episodes from TV where they are often better than on this DVD!"
4,"Bought seasons 1-3, can only view 1 & 2, Ireland","Having read a review by a french fan I realised that I could order from USA and watch in europe. So ordered the 3 pack version. I was delighted, really enjoyed season 1 then season 2 even better. Imagine my dissapointment when season 3 would not work. It stated Wrong Zone. So be aware."
4,"Can't wait for the third season, but...","Negative technical complaints aside, I am so happy to own the first two seasons and can't wait for the third in a few days. But, I feel like maybe we are being taken for a ride in that they have bumped up the price considerably beginning with the third season. Is it the old ""bait and switch"" scheme, lure us in with a reasonable introductory price then take us to the cleaners knowing we will want the remainder of the series? I suppose if you compare the price to a season of ""Friends"" this is still a bargain. Still, the only reason to bump up the price of the third season of Little House over the first two is probably nothing more than greed."
3,doesn`t work on English DVD Players,"I orderered this product before, but sent it back because it didn`t work on my DVD player, very dissapointing.I got my money back and continued to watch Season 1 and Season 2 on DVD on my player.I recently ordered Season 3 again only for the same thing to happen again ( doesn`t work on English players).I tried a DVD in the computer, and this worked. I was so pleased to be able to watch Little House On The Praire Season 3."
5,The Discs were in original unopened packaging and work perfectly,The Discs were in original unopened packaging and work perfectly. We love the series and enjoyed the extras at the end.
3,Little House Season 3,"I got this DVD set for Christmas. I've enjoyed watching it, but I was EXTREMELY annoyed to discover that at least one episode (The Collection) is missing a significant portion of a scene.The scene where Caleb and Mattie Hodgekiss (Johnny and June Carter Cash) are in the barn while Mattie pleads with Caleb not to rob the good people of Walnut Grove was terribly butchered.The knowledge that one episode is incomplete leads me to suspect that the others are also missing significant chunks."
3,Not as good as the first two!,"After buying and viewing season 1 & 2 I was looking forward to season 3. After viewing the first episode it reminded me of my own VHS copies where I cut out the commercials. I bought DVD because of quality, not wanting VHS quality.I saw the first Little House years ago. My family and I were hooked. I waited years for the episodes to come out. I planned to buy all. I will wait to read the reviews on the next seasons before I buy.Please, someone straighten this out!"
2,Do you understand the definition of order,Unless you like to watch things out of order i would suggest against this product the episodes are out of order and it's very frustrating. to say the least i was not happy when i found out that the episodes were out of order.
3,OUt of Order,"I used to watch Little House as a child and was glad to finally relive some of those memories on DVD. I don't recall scenes so couldn't say if any have been cut, but I was disappointed ""The Race"" and ""Bunny"" were out of order. Watching the race, it felt like I had missed something, or at the very least forgotten something from season two, but then ""Bunny"" assured me I hadn't missed a thing. The editing should have been better in that regard."
1,NO CLOSED-CAPTIONING,"Everyone knows the show is worthy of a five-star rating, so I don't care about the ""star rating"" in terms of the show itself. My one star rating is for the lack of closed-captioning. The captioning symbol is prominently displayed on the spine and the back of the dvd. Yet to my vast irritation and disappointment, the DVDs are NOT captioned. This is false and misleading labeling. I am extremely hard-of-hearing and I NEED captioning. This is infuriating. I don't trust that the other seasons are captioned, so I will not be purchasing them. Let me make clear that Amazon is not at fault; the fault lies with the fraudulent manufacturer itself. Beware of Lionsgate DVDs."
3,A Few problems,"I haven't bought this season yet but I have been reading reviews about certain episodes. Someone said Albert joined the cast in season three when if I remembered right didnt happen untill the Ingalls went to Dakota terriorty which would be season 5, the same with the epiisode in which Mary's baby dies in a fire. Since she didnt go blind until the end of season four and the fire was at the blind school this couldnt have been season three."
3,Non American Customer 2,"I would like to agree with ""Non American customer"". On the packaging it states that the DVD's are zones (1-6), i.e. region free. SEASON 3 DISCS ARE NOT REGION FREE. They are REGION 1 restricted. Why is this? Why make LHOTP season 1 and 2 region free and season 3 region 1 only? Do the producers of this DVD think that the people in the USA and Canada are the only people in the world that would like to have a DVD copy of LHOTP? LHOTP was a world wide loved TV series. I tried to buy a region 2 copy in my local CD/DVD store(i.e. HMV and Virgin Megastores) only to be told that they are not available in as region 2 discs. Thankfuly I have DVDIdlePro which makes my software DVD player and my hardware DVD player region free and allows me to view the discs I purchased from Amazon.com. This is the reason I only gave this season 3 stars, otherwise it would have been 5."
5,correction,"to the reviewer whodat, the price for all the sets are the same. Amazon chose to only give a discount of 15% on this set as compared to 25% off on the first two."
2,Not very good. Hardly good at all.,"Okay,here are the basic reasons I hate {don't like} this season. For one thing, The episodes. In this specific season 3 they have the WORST episodes in this season. Here's my theory. Season 1 &2 were EXCELLENT. And this is the WORST SEASON SO FAR. And why did they put Bunny and The Race in the wrong order? Take my advice, Watch BUNNY before THE RACE. I like sevreal episodes though like, To live with Fear is really good. But why is Fred {the goat} so annoyng and pathetic? But it is really funny. And The Blizzard was good. I did not care to watch The Monster of Walnut Grove by the description ,I can tell it doesn't flow. Oh well let's hope season 4 will be better. Oh I forgot , Bunny and the race are the BEST episodes from season 3. Even though this season is hardly good at all, I am still a big little house lover."
2,A Disappointment After Seasons One and Two,"I grew up watching ""Little House"" first-run on NBC. I also watched re-runs with parts chopped out of them for years, and always hoped that someday I could purchase them uncut. The first two seasons on DVD were excellent; it was like watching a different show than what you see now in the syndicated versions (and on the videos produced by Goodtimes, I might add!) I was so excited!When Season 3 came out I expected the same uncut shows. Except for only a few, these episodes are exactly like the ones shown in syndication, with scenes and lines of dialogue missing, so I am quite disappointed. I would much rather have had the missing scenes than the opening music and scene indexes for every show. I will wait until I see some reviews for Season 4 before I buy it."
3,little house on the prairie season three,ok not one of my favorites but the quality is definitly great.
4,"worthwhile, great value",I was amazed at how many programmes they could fit into one pack. We have hours and hours of Little House to enjoy together. There are a few glitches where the music or picture may hiccup a little due to the age of the episodes but overall we are very happy customers.
4,Little House- Season 3,"I love this show, and Season 3 is my second favorite season. This is a great DVD set. The only problem is that ""The Race"" is before ""Bunny"", but it's supposed to be the other way around."
2,A Disappointment After Seasons 1 and 2,"Just wanted to add to my earlier review. When I mentioned episodes being ""uncut"", I was referring to the actual show itself. Opening/closing credits and scene indexes are nice to have, but I would MUCH rather the shows have no scenes or dialogue left out. I consider an episode ""uncut"" if I get to see parts that are left out when it is shown on T.V. Most of the Season 3 shows are like the ones in syndication."
4,Great for kids,This is a great option to offer my 10-year-old grandsons instead of standard kid TV fare these days. The values are solid and the stories are entertaining. The other good part is they don't have to sit through commercials to get to the content.
3,Little House Season 3,Great family shows. Sound quality fair. Picture quality good. 2 of the shows would not play.
4,CLASS OF NUKE EM HIGH,"Let me start off by saying that this is one of the better Troma films but not better than the toxic avenger.Nuke em high is about a nuclear power plant that leaks into Tromaville high causing students to mutate.Thats preatty much the plot without taking about the createns, but this is a Troma movie so who cares about the plot.Fans of Troma will love this but those who don't might want to look eleswhere.Followed but two sequels that shouldn't have ever been made."
4,"The 4 ""R'S"" Reading, Writing and Radiation","From the mind of Lloyd Kaufman who brought us The Toxic Avenger, and Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D. Yet another realy funny yet messed up Troma film. IF you like Violence and lots of nudity then see this film!"
2,"Slightly good film from the makers of ""The Toxic Avenger""","Troma's previous film, 'The Toxic Avenger', was a cult hit worldwide. Troma has tried but failed to acheive cult statutas again with 'Class of Nuke 'Em High', an overlong horror/sci-fi/comedy about teens at a local high school who are contaminated by toxic waste from a nearby nuclear power planet. Some good scenes, but fails to deliver the same graphic violence as 'The Toxic Avenger' and 'Surf Nazi's Must Die'. As in all Troma films, this film is extremely long and dosn't know when to quit."
2,Class of Nuk'EM High,"Class of Nuk'EM High is one of Troma's better movies but that ain't saying much. The movie is very sloppy and looks like there wasn't much time taken into it, but what do you expect from a B movie? Well there is a lot better B movies out there then this one. It is good for a Troma movie and Troma fans will like it but if you hate Troma movies stay away from this one. I really liked ""The Toxic Avenger"" and I felt this was a let down compared to that film. Troma made two sequels to this and they were even worse.For a Troma this is good,but they haven't yet made a film really good since ""The Toxic Avenger""."
3,Class of Nuke 'Em High (Blu-ray),The movie was fairly entertaining. It was very silly. Not the type of movie you would want to watch a 2nd time.
2,"Sick, sick, sick","The fumes coming from a chemical plant seep into the nearby high school, turning the preppies into delinquents and the goody two shoes into mutants. Almost completely repulsive, this film is good when it's serious but the mixture of comedy, sexual appeal, and low brow horror is not very entertaining. The makers of this film just don't understand that a good movie doesn't always have to be sick to be sexy, or scary for that matter. Or funny. Too many gross-out factors and not enough emphasis on the actual CLASS."
3,Enjoyed it but could have been better,This is my first troma film i own... and yes i wacthed Toxic Avenger IV - Citizen Toxie and i love it... i like how toxie was super violent & funny but Class of Nuke 'Em High was not thit vioent & funny the effects are pretty cool it needed more of it here and there.The story was kinda good but nothing to brag about.It would have been better if half the people in the school was Infected by the toxic backteria instead of just 6 or 7 people.This is probley one of the best troma films out there.
5,Troma classic 4 sure!,"I first seen this movie when i was about 10 years old. It really freaked me out with its wierdness but years after, when i got to about 19 years old, i still couldnt get it out of my head. Then i started wondering if its out on DVD, to my surprise, it was! WOW! I thought i was the only one who really dig this film, slapstick humour, perfectly cast characters, some sexy, not to mention, psycho chicks & troma style gore! Even the main characters get in touch with thier darkside's! Its a classic & includes a lot of characters from the toxic avenger movies. Its a classic troma film, & a stand-alone awesome independant film aswell. If u aint seen a Troma film b4, definetly check it out. It bends hollywood rules & goes beyond them! Lloyd Kaufman's a genius! Its a low budget film but some of the special FX will amaze you....By the way, i havent even got the 1 with special features like deleted scenes & commentary, so even more reason to buy this, i am."
5,Awesomely bad!,Class of Nuke Em'High is so awesomely bad!!! It is the best 'bad' movie I have ever seen! I have watched this movie over and over for more than 10 years... I know every word and every scene... I can also point out all the mess-up's!! I never get tired of seeing this film!!
4,Nuk em higher and higher,This film is very entertaining. Has that high-school atmosphere even though many of the actors look in their twenties. For a low-budget film it really depicts the nuclear aspect surprisingly well. The goober-like crowd against the nuclear-infected crowd is the good vs. evil in this film and it has its goofy moments and creative moments. Some real baberaham Lincolns' as well. In the end I thought the writing and team-effort acting was what propelled this movie to success.
4,Picture of Dorian Gray--Well Worth the Read,"I had heard speak of The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I must admit I did not expect the depth and clarity of thought, the utter honesty to be found in this short novel. It is worth reading. It is worth buying. I wish I had read this when I was younger. This is one book I will give to my children. If I could, I would make this a part of highschool litterature versus many other pieces we were given to read. It is indeed a classic."
5,Great Classic,"If you have seen the movies or know the story, the book is a completely different experiance! Beautiflly written and so much more than just a story about a man who doesn't age while the portrait does. Captivating and darkly thought provoking.. Great writting and facinating characters. Highly recommended!"
3,Forever Young,"Innocent and young Dorian Gray is seduced by some bad influences, and taught to worship youth, beauty, and sensation. Due to a passionate prayer, the physical effects of a life dedicated to self-gratification and pleasure-seeking are borne by a painting of him instead of by his own body. The story focuses not on the actual events of Dorian's life, but the discussions on the philosophies supporting such a life. To this reviewer, the message is that a life of selfishness and self-gratification corrupts, and in the end we can have no separation from this corruption. Dorian Gray is a tad slow at times, as the conversations can get long, but it is still educational, and certainly worth reading."
3,"Good, Not Great","The storyline is very good and the theme is thought provoking. However, the great weakness for me are the characters in this piece. Character driven novels have characters that bring out some form of emotion from the reader. Be it fondness, admiration, sympathy for the hero or hate of the villain. I had no emotional interest in any of the characters in this book. I simply didn't care about any of their fates. Had Wilde developed the characters better this could have been a masterpiece."
5,Great Book,I have watched the old movie of this story and the newer one but had never read the book. This was excellent!
3,Read only when you have nothing else available,"This is my first time reading this book and I found that it was difficult to get in to the story. The book was overly descriptive in some instances that lead to me envisioning the story exactly as the author had seen it instead of leaving a lot of it up to my imagination. This is not a problem when reading a non-fiction book but when it comes to fiction, I feel it is a hindrance to my ability to enjoy the book. I would recommend this book to those who have nothing else they would like to read at this time, otherwise, watch the movie version of this."
4,IF YOU NEVER READ IT NOWS THE TIME,I READ IT IN HIGHSCHOOL AND JUST REREAD IT AND NOW THAT SOMEONE DID NOT MAKE ME READ IT I ENJOYED IT SO MUCH MORE
5,Classic Thriller,"Classical, timeless and wonderfully written tale of that expands on the 'how evil corrupts your soul' theory."
5,A cautionary tale,"I listened to the audio version, which was a delight. This classic impresses upon the reader the importance of Christ's rhetorical question: what does it profit a man to gain the whole word but lose his soul? Wilde also underscores the point that true beauty resides in the eternal soul not the temporal body. This is a book to read and re-read."
5,Masterful,"I was highly impressed by this novel of arts, society, morality and immortality. It has to be one of the most deepest things that I have ever read. One thing that bothered me a little was how Oscar Wilde went through this long winded prose and at times became a bit essay like but it had gave me food for thought."
3,Interesting,"I picked up this book as I was intrigued by the character of Dorian Gray after having watched The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. It was an interesting book, and while I cannot say that I liked it as such, it is good to have read it - my curiosity is satisfied.It was very sad that Dorian went so completely ""off the rails"", so to speak, under the influence of Henry, and I found the worldview difficult to cope with. At times the irony in the situations was very poignant - such as when Dorian tells Sybil Vane that she is selfish, while he, in fact, is the selfish one. I suppose that justice was met at the end of the book."
2,Not Very Illustrated,"I really have no idea why ""Illustrated"" is included in the title of this work. The only part of this book that is illustrated (besides the cover) is the short biography found at the end of the book."
4,Wilde,"Wilde could have made things a lot more unpleasant for Grey. I suppose a sinner being triumphant in life was part of the theme. Nonetheless, a must read"
4,You cant beat a good classic!,And this is one of them! Overall it is a good book that i would recommend everyone reads! It can be a little dry in parts for younger readers but this version portrays the original book perfectly!
3,Still reading,"I love the author's play of words. Still in the process of reading it, I want to enjoy every page so I am taking my time with this one."
2,Dorian Gray,The characters were at times insufferable which is the point. I would have liked more detail of Gray's adventures which were almost entirely left to the imagination. Ending came too quick for me.
5,Judging a book by its cover,"I haven't actually read the book yet, but dang does it look good on my shelf! Penguin clothbound is wonderful."
2,Wilde's Egotism,I have recently read this book as part of my A-level syllabus and found it little more than an excuse for Wilde to voice his egotistical and condemnatory views of Victorian society. The storyline is faintly interesting but is ruined by Wilde's constant attack on Women.
2,Not really that good.....,"The picture of Dorian wasn't that great of a novel. The subjects in this moral fable are very dramatic but go exceedingly too far. Tragedy stalks every crack and turn of it. It ends in a tragedy. In the beginning, it is rather happy, but right after the actress and lover commits suicide it goes completely. I do not doubt Wilde's famed wit but, he could have written something more happy than this depressing novel. The descriptions are very well done(especially in the beginning.) Thus, he should used his wit and humor for a more enjoyable and felicatous novel."
3,this book,"this book was really really twisted, our sophmore class had to read it for school, and almost everyone hated it"
4,Better the First Time,"Loved it as a kid, but superficial and predictable. A fun and enjoyable First read. Dorian Gray does represent the reality of the British Aristocracy of old and how useless their lives really were for many."
4,A Fine Study of Human Nature,"Especially considering the time of writing, this book sets out a rare insight into the workings of the human mind. The worms of pride and guilt, coupled with the Freudian concept of projection best explain the intriguing transformation of the picture of Dorian Gray."
5,"Great book, ruined by copy cats!","Great book, very quick read and a must for anyone who really wants to understand the english cannon. I think I've seen 3 ""Twilight Zone"" episodes that feature the same plot though, kind of ruined the surprise halfway through..."
5,could this be love?,I love this book! I completely think that I have fallen in love with the character Lord Henry. He is by far one of the wittiest characters that I have ever read in a book and trust me that I have read many books! I think that Oscar Wilde was a genius and this is one of the best literary works that he has written.It is a story of innocence lost and the quest of forever staying young.
4,-Liz S.,"The Picture Of Dorian Gray, by Oscar WildeNon-fiction, I liked the book a lot and I would recommend this book to any with a strong enough reading skill.I enjoyed this book, because it kept me guessing. I thought I knew what was going to happen, but it almost always turned out that I was wrong. This is a very good book if you like to think.I also liked the book because it was a challenging book. The vocabulary in it was from the time it was written about, and was hard to understand. If you read this book, you need to be able to understand words from context.I liked this book because it talked about the eternal fight for beauty, and I think that this is an interesting topic. Everyone has a inner struggle, and it also great when you can pick someone's brain, and find out why they struggle with themselves.I liked this book, and I think this is going to be a classic for a very long time. You should read this book!"
2,It is a very thematic book but not real spellbinding,"I was not too fond of the book but some people might like it. If you are the type of person who likes to meditate on the books that you read, this book might be good for you. I brought up many ideas that provoke thought."
2,Rewarding but tedious,"For me, The Picture of Dorian Gray was a tedious read. I did not particularly enjoy it that much, although I acknowledge that it is a good piece of literature. It is very well written and full of details and vivid descriptions. The story is told artfully and exquisitely but I found it long-winded and difficult to get through at times. Many people would enjoy a book like this, but it was not for me. I couldn't relate to the British aristocracy system and was utterly appalled at how unbelievably shallow the characters were, although Wilde was probably going for that effect. I was also disappointed with the ending. I thought the point of the novel would be to eliminate the stereotype that bad people are ugly, but it just perpetuated it. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a book that makes them think. It is also recommended to people who like books from this era (late 1800's) and have a lot of time on their hands."
2,Disappointed,"The book ""Picture of Dorian Grey"" by Oscar Wilde that I ordered ""used"" arrived with the front cover defaced by a pen being used to totally cover the picture's face and hands and then a sticker of a Freddy Crueger (sp) type mask placed over the face. There was no mention in the description of this used book as to the front cover defacement and I find that negligent."
2,Picture of Dorian Gray,"The Picture of Dorian Gray is well-written, contains compelling ideas, and evocative. But it lacks substance. In my opinion this story is not really a novel because Oscar Wilde just uses it as a medium through which he can profess his views. While his views are not banal in the least, they are forced. He should not have to lower himself and preach to the reader."
1,Really Horrible,"I was really looking forward to this book, since I heard glowing reviews about it. However, I found it to be perhaps the most excruciating reading experience of my life thus far (with the exception of mathematics texts), and I wish I could've given it 0 stars. I don't mind it when authors digress a bit from the story to reflect on a theme or two, but Wilde did it so often it seemed like I was reading a 100+ page philosophy essay on art. I think Wilde is a fantastic writer with an almost perfect sense of wit, and I think he had a good story, but something went wrong when he was writing the manuscript and he ended up making this novel a university lecture for his beliefs."
1,BOOOO HISS!,"I read this book some time ago for a book club, and we all thought it was a total snooze. I really love reading classics, but this one was painful to get through. I swear there was a whole chapter on curtains."
1,A terrible waste of a great story idea!,"I did not like this piece. I feel that Oscar Wilde used this as a semi-autobiographical vehicle to transport his radical, eccentric ideas and ideals. He speaks through his characters of Lord Henry and Dorian Gray. They seek to justify debauchery and murder and they kill off anyone who is good, kind, moral or differs in opinion with them. A good read, perhaps, for the likes of the 42nd president of the USA. This book falls far short of it's hype and offers absolutely nothing of merit."
3,Not as good as I expected for such a literary icon,"I picked up this book to read, partly because I am a big fan of Wilde's plays, and partly because the concept behind this novel has become such a part of our collective conscious that I wanted to know what was behind it.It was filled with all the wit and cynicism that I expect from Wilde, but, I found it to be a bit tiresome to read. I suspect that this is partially due to the fact that it is so solidly grounded in the late 1800's that the concerns of the characters are a bit distant.Still, I must say that I feel that it is a book worth reading. Anything that has seared itself into the western world's consciousness is worth investigating."
4,"Cleverly Written, but Unsatisfying","This book fits Wilde's description of a cigarette as a perfect pleasure - portable and brief, yet leaving you unsatisfied. Like Dorian Gray himself, this book is superficially charming, with its numerous and clever epigrams, but with some very ugly undercurrents, e.g. virulent anti-semitism, misogyny, and homosexuality. We never connect emotionally with Dorian Gray, who never matures into a complex or interesting character, but remains as some gay ideal with psychosis. Read Henry James' ""Portrait of a Lady"" or Edith Wharton's ""Age of Innocence"" for a far better written, devastating attack on Victorian morals and hypocrisy."
4,The Picture of Dorian Grey by Oscar Wilde,I enjoyed reading this book I chose it because of the Author. I had not read anything by Oscar Wilde until this book and it is a good read.The Picture of Dorian Gray
4,Oscar Wilde a gifted author from AMAZON,"I was interested in reading a book by Oscar Wilde. This title intrigued me, or rather the description of the young man who wanted to always stay young and have the picture grow old. I haven't gotten very far into the book as yet, but appreciate the writing. Author is good with words."
4,fascinating story,"I have seen the old movie several times, and it tempted me to order the book. Oscar Wilde was a ""wild child"", and he gives a glimpse into the often vain and decadant world of English society through the wanton excesses of Dorian...who appears to remain beautiful, youthful, and untouched by evil. It is Dorian's portrait that decays with every misdeed, including murder. The picture haunts Dorian as he travels among the rich, and also into the opium dens and low life of the waterfront. This edition contains a glossary of lesser known terms and references, for us modern folk. It was a quick and fascinating read."
4,interesting.,"definitely an interesting book. a classic. would read if you are into classics. quite violent and shocking. i should have seen it coming, but it was still good"
4,Vanity,The pompous words of Harry and the ego of Dorian fill the pages with quotable prose and vividly divine images.
5,The Picture of Dorian Gray,"This is a beautiful book, full of vivid word pictures. Wilde is a genius of literature. Everyone should read this book"
4,It gets better as you get older,"This was one of my favorite reads as a pre-teen so I was eager to read it again 50 years later. What I learned was how differently I understood the story. As a young person, I enjoyed the premise and the supernatural aspect of the subject. Wouldn't that be cool sort of thing. But now, I see the struggle between good and evil, self-indulgence versus altruism, hedonism versus retraint and self-respect. I wish I had appreciated more of that as a young person; it probably would have helped me avoid some of the pitfalls of growing up. A provocative read for all ages."
5,An enchanting story by an unforgettable author,"The Picture of Dorian Gray is an amazing story told with such wonderful truth and cynicysim as only Wilde could tell it. Not only do I have much of the book highlighted, but it is worn from reading again and again. I would definitly reccomend this brilliant novel to anyone who wants to walk away with a feeling as if they've discovered a treasure they must share with the world."
5,Beautiful and witty,This is a beautiful and witty tale about a depraved man. His ugly soul is mirrored by his ever-changing portrait while he retains his youthful visage. Suspenseful throughout. A classic.
4,Great classic tale,This was a wonderful read. I love the the homoerotic overtures. I can imagine the scandal this must have caused.
3,Where is the famous preface?,The preface is missing which is a critical to the book! Print it out from some other source if you are going to buy this edition. The story is amazing otherwise!
3,"A literature classic, but not quite what I expected","The book starts out OK, with the known Oscar Wilde wit and his excellent descriptive skills. However, towards the middle of the book, the plots descends into a lengthy tiring description of artifacts (musical instruments, stones and jewelry, portraits and so on) that really break the rhythm of the book. By the time I reached the end, I was quite fed up with this inventory of objects. The book ends with a moral, which I found to be quite void and meaningless, as I did not accept the book's premise - That all sins and corruption will manifest in one's physical image."
5,Beauty and Dorian Gray: An Indulgence in Artistry,This book is a facsinating read that blends insult and injury quite well. Fat and ugly people surely will be delighted or destroyed. Wittisms roar and pundits will roll in hedonism for the intelligentsia. A must-read for good-looking people and geniuses everywhere.
2,"Too much anti-victorian philosophy, not enough story.","This novel is a philosophy book about the author's narcissistic anti-Victorian views and clever witticisms. Oh yeah, somewhere in there is a story about a man who makes a wish that his portrait would show his physical age and experiences, while he remains forever young and handsome. The wish comes true.There was incredible potential for this story that wasn't lived up too. I think this novel really needed a heavy-handed editor to make it great."
1,Terrible typography/printing of this edition,"This book came from Tribeca Books (even though is says ""CreateSpace"" on Amazon), a print-on-demand shop that does not know how to set typography or books. The text runs to the edge of the page. Instead of using curly quotes like every other book on the planet, it uses inch marks. The binding is also low quality, as you need to practically break it to get the book to stay open. If these things do not bother you, then buy this version of the book. But if you would rather have a nice-looking version, try this one from World Library (I haven't seen it yet but am ordering now). [...]"
5,One of the Best,"After reading this story of a man who is so caught up in beauty that he ruins his life over it, I took the time to examine my own feelings on many things....Wilde has done it again in this one.I LOVED IT!!"
5,"Timeless, controversial, poetic, disturbing","Still controversial today, Wilde's study of a man's moral distintigration is both richly poetic and ultimately disturbing. The book even resists classification today. Is it part of the Decadence movement or the Symbolist movement?Or is it an experimental novel, fashioned perhaps as a psychological gothic study? More importantly, though, Wilde's creation poses the question: Can a book be poisonous? Gray succumbs to the ""evil"" influence of Huysmans' book A Rebours. As Wilde as written, ""there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. Books are well written or badly written."" Wilde may have created a well written book, but he also, albeit purposely, created a book when, viewed from its many horizons, can be seen as terrible moral study in the lesson Gray undergoes."
2,"Well written, but not enjoyable","I read this book as a child (around 11) in Russian. Finally decided to re-read it in English. I was astonished as to how differently I perceived it this time around. Without a question, Wilde is a master of words, but the subject of this book was questionable. It appeared to me, that Wilde was set on pushing his own philosophy and views of life and self onto others, and, as I read it, I found myself rejecting it with every fiber of my being. I was rather surprised to have such a strong reaction to this piece of literature. Would not read again and would not recommend it to others either. Just my two cents."
5,Love to read,I've only just started reading the book but so far I've enjoying what I've read of it to this point.
2,This book was very mysterious:),"I feel sad that I couldn't give this book more than two stars. I thought the book was too boring, and event hough there was a secret message(I will not comment on Dorian being a homosexual, though)in this book ,it somehow left be quite empty actually. Maybe I didn't like this book ,because I didn't understand Dorian or the character's. I don't know. But you people describe it so well, that I feel like I've missed something important. The plot was pretty good and simple, but I got bored reading endless conversations and walks and stuff. Maybe if I read the book again,I can giva a better review on it. I surely hope so:)"
2,Oh Dear,"I'm reading this for Book Club and I try not to put it down -- because I'm afraid I won't pick it up again! While I see how good the story is, I'm sorry to admit that I find the author buffoonish in the way he goes on and on about some things -- I get the point! I know that some of it comes down to the fact that the book was written in 1891, but I've read Greek plays, other authors from different eras, etc., and liked them, so maybe I just don't appreciate Oscar Wilde."
1,Could not finish this,I did not enjoy this story. I really really wanted to. I tried very hard but in the end I was just plain bored. When I realized I was wasting my time I moved on.
4,The Picture of Dorian Gray,I thought it was a very good book. Just keep in mind that it was written in the 1800s. It is very detailed to give the reader as much visual description as possible.
4,relax,Interesting to read. A well known but still interesting book. If you look for something to get you away from your current thinking and relax your brain.
3,Oscars wit runs Wilde,"I would love to give this a five star review because I am a great fan of Oscar Wilde from his well known works to De Profundis, but the inconsistancy of this story made it difficult to get into.The first half is a vehicle for Wilde's wit, unfortunately at the expense of story line and character developement, although I should that for me the wit of Oscar Wilde was reason enough to keep me reading. The second half of the book tells the majority of the story and is a much more accessable read.Would I reccomend this book? I think this is one of the few times I would say see the film (1945 starring George Saunders and Angela Lansbury) and then read the book. The book alone is not the best showcase for the genius of Oscar Wilde."
4,***,"Book is in great condition and received it quickly. The only CON is the book was really small. If the description said it was a gift book size, then it is my fault for missing it in the description."
2,Accuracy issues,Im so glad this book is free but you get what you pay for. I have found quite a few typos in this version. I have actually decided to download it on iBooks because that version is properly edited.
4,Classic,"While slow at times, it really is a wonderful thriller. I read it a long time ago, and enjoyed it more this time."
3,Relevance of the book today,"If I had read this book decades ago, I would rate it higher. Today it would be difficult to get people to read it. As a former English teacher, I was fascinated and intrigued by Wilde's sentence structure and word choice; most readers today would find it stilted and actually difficult to read. In addition, the class structure adds more problems for understanding how the characters behaved. Lastly, the older British custom of describing men and their feelings about their friends would put off many readers. (Same problem with some of Shakespeare's sonnets.) While it is certainly a classic, there are many contemporary authors who deal with the theme as well as Wilde. It is probably a great choice for English literature majors; however. I suspect the general public could invest their time better with another book."
3,I expected much more.,"When I first bought this book, I expected it to be one of the best novels I had ever read. Boy, was I wrong. The book held my interest for the first half, but it got very boring. I skipped to about page 190, read a very exciting part, and then I skipped all the way to the end to read a stunning ending. If all that excess in the middle had been deleted, I would have given the book 5 stars."
4,Glad to be finished writing a research paper about this book,"First of all: I wish people would stop deconstructing Oscar Wilde before they deconstruct his message. He should be free to contradict himself, because ""the way of paradoxes is the way of truth"" (Dorian Gray). Secondly: I liked it, but didn't relate to the Victorian art scene and the ""choose-life-before-art"" message. It's worth reading, but I'd say Wilde's plays and poetry are more fun."
4,A book that makes you think!,"I think Dorian Gray is a book that is different for different people. For me it was a new experience, because I haven't read many books from the 19th century. I would believe that at the time when it was first published, it was a very different book for everyone. You can definetly see that the book contains lots of homosexual stuff. I think it's amazing that Oscar Wilde had the courage to write about that at such an early time. The book touched something deep in me even though it didn't have anything to do with my life or my present situation."
3,A book reflective of the author,"Picture of Dorian Gray was written by a man who was egocentric, socially polished and forever looking for the quiticential colloquialism. Notwithstanding, this book was a pleasure to read! It was easy to understand and was smattered with references to events and literature which were likely considered posh by English nobility in the mid-ninteenth century (i.e. Shakespeare, Greek Mythology, etc.). As stated above, this book is very reflective of the author in both spirit and style. I would definately recommend this book to a beginner reader of the English classics, due to its length and lack of confounding implicies which are common for this type of literature."
5,Very enjoyable and thought provoking.,"I quite enjoyed the sharp witty dialogue,particularily that of Lord Henry who was one of the most interesting and provocative characters I've come across in quite some time."
2,Pretentious and boring,"The definition of ""classic"" is something timeless and universal; this book is neither. It does ask some ""deep"" questions but it doesn't make you really care about the answers; the characters are one-dimensional and transparent. It's hard to seriously relate to any of them, or this story. The writers' language is beautiful in a flowery way. If you want a feel for the book, read the intro/prelude; there are some interesting statements Wilde makes about ""ART"". Otherwise, don't bother. There's only so much of art-imitates-life-life-imitates-art you can take."
3,Not an easy book for modern readers,"This cautionary tale of sensuality, excess, vanity, and self-love is slow-going for today's readers, used to a brisker pace of writing. The story is wonderful but could have been told in far fewer words; however, word count excess wasn't important in the era in which Wilde wrote and lived his own unique brand of literature, art, and life.Wonderful witty, sarcastic and caustic writing of course, all being Wilde's trademarks."
3,An interesting read...,"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a classic novel about the consequences of eternal youth. Young Dorian Gray promised his soul in exchange for the favor of his body never aging. Instead, a portrait of him grows older in his place. An eerie idea, indeed.While the concept and story itself are extremely interesting it was not the best execution. As another reviewer pointed out, it's not the easiest read for a modern reader. While the passages did not confuse me they did occasionally bore me. I found the book hard to get into - and once I got into it I had a hard time keeping interest.I do not doubt Wilde's credibility as an author in the slightest I feel that, as a modern reader, this is a book that may not stand the test of time as well as others. An extremely interesting idea, but the book feel a bit short."
4,Dorian Gray,I enjoyed this public domain book very much in that the story line held my interest and was full of interesting observations of human nature which are as relevant now as they must have been when the book was published.
5,A classic!!!,"First of all, it is free and it is a classic you cannot miss. Short lecture with a great story"
3,So beautiful and so vile,"Dorian Gray deserved to die a lonely, bitter man. What fascinates me about his story is the way in which he was hammered on by Lord Henry and yet found no room for the good influence of others. Fascinating tale. Skipped the tedious descriptions of Dorian's collections. Ugh. I just couldn't bring myself to care about the diversion."
4,Well Told,"The themes contained in this rather short novel are extraordinary. That should be motive for reading through the entire book because one needs to get to the end in order to appreciate and understand the themes. It is a bit dry for a couple chapters in the middle of the book in my opinion, but it is not enough to seriously mar the book itself."
4,Classicly good,I must have read this book several times through out my lifetime and it never gets old. I saw the movie and decided to read it again and it never failed to entertain
4,A great work!,"Oscar Wilde had a wonderful talent of being able to totally take the reader into whatever story he happened to be telling. In this tale of sin and tragedy, one can feel the fog wrapping around them, the cramped and dark opium dens, and the longing in the heart of Mr. Dorian Gray.If you are in the mood for a work of art that will capture your emotions and drag them along for a ride filled with 'shadows and early doom' (as Bob Dylan might say), this is the book for you. At its end it will leave you sitting staggered, feeling like you have been to the depths of a human soul and back again."
3,An interesting read,"Not a book I would typically read, but it was interesting in the fact that it truly centered around the main character and his own ideals. A very quick end to a detailed book."
4,"The Picture of Dorian Gay, more like it","Oscar Wilde is...Oscar Wilde. Modern readers will chuckle at some of the man-man interactions and physical descriptions. Nonetheless, worth it for a free kindle book."
4,Free SF Reader,I would imagine that there is not a very large chance you would findthis book in the waiting room of any plastic surgeon's office. Anexample of a story that suggests be careful of what you wish for. Ayoung man makes a deal to keep himself young and youthful looking.Unfortunately there is a secret associated with this that is hard tohide.
3,Picture of Dorian grey,Very wordy. Takes too long to get to the point. Very poetic if that is what You want - not the case for me As i try to escape from reality in books but just wanted to escape from this book.
2,The Picture of Dorian Gray - 1891,"Plot Kernel: Dorian Gray has his image painted by a man who reveres him beyond measure. During his portraiture, Gray meets Lord Henry Wotton, who preaches self-indulgence and the high social value, yet lamentable ephemerality, of youth. Influenced by Lord Henry, Gray becomes cold-hearted and self-centered. Gray soon discovers that his descent into moral dissolution is being represented by changes in his portrait. Over the years, Gray seems never to age, while his image in the portrait ages in his place and also continues to show the ongoing moral dissolution within Gray's character. In the end, he cannot bear to be what he has become.Comment: This novel struck me as glib. It is the novel of an intellectual fop."
2,A puzzling edition,"It's difficult to know the purpose of this edition of Wilde's novella. I didn't notice when I ordered it that it's not the size of a regular book--it's more the size of an academic journal or magazine. Nearly 8 X 10 inches. Further, there's no named editor, no introduction, no apparatus at all. Just the text of the story--and that is printed in two columns on the page. The result is a book that won't fit on the shelf and that is unpleasant to read. Baffling."
2,"Would be great, if it was half the length","Review by Jason LushOne hundred and ninety pages of political masturbation disguised as a supernatural suspense story. Of the three main characters we have; Dorian Gray, who is a brainless puppet the personifies vanity; Basil Hallward, the artist who painted the fabled portrait and represents the sorrowful conscience; and Lord Henry Wolton, who is the quintessential 19th Century fop whose sole purpose in the book is to act as Wilde's voice on politics, religion and homosexuality and as a driving corrupter of everyone else in the book.The pacing is horrendously slow, the chapters devoted to explaining Gray's hobbies and the pictures of his ancestors in his hallway don't help with the lousy pacing. The whole story could have been condensed to a 30 page novella and would have been enjoyable.And, as a side note to the posthumous Mr. Wilde, forty is not old and hideous."
2,Timeless classic? I hardly think so.,"First off, let me begin by saying that this book was not completely devoid of any good characteristics. It was written in a style of gentle prose that was easy to read, and it did put forth at least a few interesting concepts. On the whole though, the ideas in this book were utterly ridiculous and totally lacking in any true depth. They appear to me to be the vain ramblings of a man consumned in his own deepness, thereby proving how shallow he truly was. I would liken this book to a picture in which detailing, shading, and general looks are pleasing, but the perspective is off, ruining the whole picture. So perhaps you would enjoy this book if you are looking for a few ideas and smart sayings put together in a seemingly random, and almost chaotic order."
1,This book really laked something.....a plot!,"Well, I had to read this book for a school assignment. I'm not really sure what I expected from this book, but I know I didn't get it. This book shows the true demoralization of our society- past and present. The absloute worst part of the book (about 90% of it) was the long, monotonous, verbose speeches that consisted of the characters'ideals that were just ""off the mark"" by a little. I would not suggest reading this book, partly because of the boring content, but mostly because of the fact that I still haven't found a plot."
2,dissapointed,"After waiting for this cd to be released ,i must admitt i was highly dissapointed.There are a few good songs on here but most of it is noise ,messed in with terrible lyrics.My addivice buy another girl fronted cd,leave this one alone."
3,These girls may just kick your teeth in!,"Clearly influenced by bands like the Runaways and Girlschool, Swedish all-girl quartet Crucified Barbara plays hard edged, no-frills, punk infused rock & roll.2005's In Distortion We Trust is the band's debut album. It's a fast, heavy, and dirty blast of hard rock with punk aggression. Throw Motorhead and the Ramones in a blender with L7 and Babes in Toyland and you'll have some idea of Crucified Barbara's sound. There are some good melodies here, but overall the album maintains a hard hitting abrasive rock sound. This is not a case of ""they rock pretty hard for a bunch of chicks"". They rock hard, period.If you've been missing down n' dirty, pretension-free rock & roll lately, you're going to want to hear this album. You should also look into bands like Bullets and Octane, Fatal Smile (also from Sweden), and Airbourne. They're bringing rock back, big time."
5,Great group!,"This is a kick-ass rock group! I heard them on the AllGirlRadio station on the internet, and loved them!!! It's good to hear some good old rock, especially from women! Being a huge Joan Jett fan, I really appreciate this group!"
5,Four chicks that will melt your face off!,"This band is simply awesome. The vocals are hard without being overbearing and the music demands respect. Each track is just as rockin' as the last, there are no dull moments here."
1,Probably Not for Die Hards,"I have to say listening to this Album was pretty much torture. The music itself, is pretty much a carbon copy of the originals, but vocally most of the songs have been ruined, especially the interpretation of Livin On a Prayer. The only song i really enjoyed was the version of I'll Be There For You, probably because the guy singing it sounded the most like Jon. The only recommendation i would make for buying this Album, is that your also fan's of the guys singing the songs - if not i would say 'stear well clear', and stick to the originals."
3,Cover Band style Tribute album,"If you like Bon Jovi, you'll like this album. If you LOVE Bon Jovi, stick to your well-worn copies of their albums. This album's biggest drawback is that even though the singer is different on each song, the back-up band is always the same (basically Warrant with a different drummer). The result is that the songs sound like Bon Jovi with different singers and slightly different guitar solos. The singers do a good job, especially, Kelly Hanson (You Give Love a Bad Name), Kory Clarke (Blaze of Glory), and Phil Lewis (Wanted Dead or Alive). Hearing these songs redone reminds me of going to see a cover band. A good cover band, but a cover band nonetheless. They were great songs when Bon Jovi put them out and they're still great songs; the tribute could have been a bit more varied though."
2,if you love 80's hair bands,i have this album and really wasnt all that impressed with it. i like 80's hair bands and all but maybe not enought to like this one. im a die hard jovi fan but the album just didnt do justice to the work that bon jovi has done.
1,Not pleased...,"I bought this as a gift for my father because he loves Hot Dog bubble gum, but when I got them they were not the original flavor that I ordered as it says in the description. Instead I got cinnamon flavor which is not as good as the original gum. I was very dissapointed and the packaging was really crappy. Had it been the original bubble gum I order as it said in the description it would have been fine. Also I tryed to contact the sellers and could not get in touch with them. I sent emails to them about my problem as well and never got a reply. Never ordering again!! Sad deal."
1,Not as Listed,I ordered these for my new high temp. glue gun that takes large glue sticks. I got these because I saw they were supposed to be high temp and the appropriate diameter. I was wrong. These glue sticks are for small glue guns and I saw them at my local dollar store here as soon as I ordered them. Don't purchase. You will be highly disappointed. I contacted said company with no response over a month later and this was with a request for refund/ return.
3,Interesting,"I chased down this book after Hunter S. Thompson included a quote from it in his Hell's Angels. It wasn't easy to get. I eventually had a copy sent from a library 2000 miles away and when it arrived, despite having been printed around 1915, the pages were still uncut.I guess this means that it's not a well-read book.Having said all that, Imaginary Obligations is a time capsule. It is a collection of essays on whatever subjects interested the author and the public at the beginning of the twentieth century.In terms of both tone and content it is patchy. Some pieces seem terribly dated and some positively trapped in amber, while others express attitudes as fresh and enlightened as if they were penned yesterday.While Mr Colby was not an essayist of the stature of Mencken or Twain, he is nonetheless worth reading, even if only from a historical perspective: To see what op-ed pieces looked like back then is, I think, worth the read."
4,Good comment on Poor Leadership,"I read this many years ago before starting my own career in the Army. It is a good example of overzealous leadership trying to expose weakness in their own troops by pushing them without the proper train up time and preparation. The commander wants to use the ""look at me"" example but for all the wrong reasons; and, of course, the officers to dare to question him are labeled as malcontents. The Marines get their fair share of this and to be honest, it's often unfair. The Marines are expected to live up to the reputation of being the ""best of the best"" and they get more pressure to go the extra mile. Sometimes this is made dangerous by putting the wrong guy in charge. Army combat units are no different and I've seen my share of guys like the commander in this story. Well written and more appreciated if you have been in the military and can relate to what is going on. Recommended."
5,Wonderful TX resource for TBI and right CVA patients,"This is a wonderful resource for clinician's, especially those that may NOT be used to working with TBI, right CVA and the higher level dysfunctions. It has exercises, compensatory strategies for both the patient, and suggestions for the patient. I've used it for years."
4,Not forgotten--,"It's a wonder that any of these movies still exist at all.No,these films aren't Citizen Kane or Gone With The Wind,but at 2.50 each,who can complain.Most folks under 40 could care less about a black and white film that runs about an hour.Fans of these types of old dark house films should like this collection.The two best in my opinion are The Phantom and Tangled Destinies.Intruder is ok but I wish they would have substituted another film like The Dark Hour '36,The Ninth Guest '34,Midnight Mystery '30,Return of the Terror '34,etc.,instead of having Dead Men Walk,which can easily be found elsewhere.You're never going to find any of these movies in pristine restored condition.That's a given.I love these old dark house forgotten movies and wish there were more sets like these.If these type of films aren't your cup of tea,a price of 99 cents would be too much.But for the rest of us;it's a fine collection."
4,ENTERTAINING POVERTY ROW!!!!!,"The quality of these films is not great, but perfectly acceptable with no splices. Dead Men Walk would be better viewed on the Roan disc. I also enjoyed the other three films. These three films have conflicting running times making it difficult to determine if they are complete. Therefore, they are most likely missing some amount of footage."
4,Golden Galician voice,"Uxia Senlle brings us, in this first work, a wonderful mix of the music of Galicia. Her folk roots are paramount, there are some lovely songs using traditional melodies but with crisp, innovative orchestrations. It is rich, tearful earthy stuff, full of the mist and mystery of this Celtic land. This is lovely music for the mystical and lovers of Celtic or world music. I think you will be happily impressed by the smooth sounding gallego language akin to Portuguese-made for music!"
2,Please attention,"This pump is not a continous pump, you need to keep shooting the trigger to grease come out. Many other you can just hold the trigger, be advice , you can get tired really fast with this pump."
1,a piece of junk,"The threaded connection where the barrel connects to the head of the grease gun is so loose that it falls apart, making a big greasy mess. The tool is useless."
4,great set!,This comforter set is great... the light blue color is beautiful. i would get this again in another color as well.
1,"Common Title, Poor Editing","The author has chosen to use his story in book form as a means to provide an outlet for his own therapy (not to mention while getting paid at the same time). I think the book could have been better written -- dialogues and all. A soror sister in the ATL sent me this book and I cannot endorse it to my soro sisters in San Diego. I understand the author wanting to climb the band wagon along with E. Lynn, Marcus Major, Carl Webber, R.M. Johnson, Michael Baisden and such likes, but he has a long way to go. This is one of those stories that nearly every ex-married person can relate. Unfortunately, there is nothing unique about his. My advice to the author and those who suffer heartache and pain: Turn all your cares over to God because he cares for you. You may or may not find temporary relief in white pages and black ink---but you will definitely find permanent relief in Christ Jesus."
4,Good Read for Men,"I completed reading your book over the holiday weekend. For reference, I read 7 or 8 books a year. I probably start and don't finish another 4 or 5. I usually read non-fiction self-help books. What did I enjoy about this book? The first thing is that I appreciated reading a book that spoke to some of my thoughts as it relates to fatherhood and relationships. There aren't many books that I've read that are written by African-American authors that don't just depict us as lazy, drunks, whores, or thugs. 'It's okay to be a loving father and husband without the drama'. Woven into core of this novel is the fact that that good overcomes evil. We navigate through life with this hope. I appreciate you poring out your thoughts on life through this tale. It was a hell of way to express your thoughts without having to preach. I commend you for your creativeness. They say we all have a book in us. Looks like you have a couple. Keep on writing, my brother."
5,Until Death Do Us Part - IT ROCKS,"Until Death Do Us Parta is the first book I've read from this author and it was GREAT. I recommend to everyone who like romance, suspense and mistery. This is not your run-of-the mill romance, suspense story !!This fantastic, suspense packed story is one that I will be keeping in my favorites file. These well described and highly developed characters have such an emotional bond between them that it brought tears to my eyes many times while reading this tale! Readers will not want to put this book down.This story for me was one that I didn't want to put down and when I absolutely had to, it kept calling my name until I could get back to it. GJT Simpson has got himself a new fan with this captivating and enchanting book and I can't wait to read what else he has in store!!! Outstanding! *****"
2,How do they choose Sundance Official Selections?,"Is it Sundance, that little logo I see on the cover? Ten minutes into the movie I started searching for movie reviews to see if I was being too hard on this movie. Most reviews are pretty bad. Acting is close to horrible and obviously there was not alot of money to make this movie but still it could have easily been much better. Two stars is a gift. Wishing for the days of Love Jones, The Best Man, or Two Can Play That Game..."
3,This movie isn't on my mind.,"The cover is more professional than the movie.Casting left much to desireBetter looking women in local barThere was no attraction between actors.Felt like a college level workI just watched 9, & that was top notch for college level work."
2,Glad I didn't pay to see it,"Ok the acting was horrible, it was definitely an amateur work but I guess exposure for the lead actress Sherial McKinney et al. She looks so much like a younger Halle Berry, without trying but also seemed to try to act like her as well. the story reminded me of a cross between Boomerang with the Eddie cheating on her and coming back and it reminds me about a reverse role of the movie where the guy can read women's thoughts. It doesn't explain how that happened for her to hear men's thoughts other than she woke up in the library and read a bunch of books. It was predictable in that you knew how the movie ended. I can't believe I watched this but I skipped through this after the first five minutes. I surfed the net most of the time."
2,amateurish.,"I saw better acting in high school. The production, the predictable plot, distractingly poor (over)acting, AMATEURISH!He'S On My Mind"
3,"OK, but a little uneven","I bought this album based on the strength of Through the Darkest Hour, which I loved. Adagio could have been a great album, but I think it falls short. Although when I heard the first track, Days of Prayer, I was thinking this could be the Album of the Year. It had the signature, unusual drum beats of the previous album and the guitars and vocals were perfectly loud and angry. Unfortunately the other songs fail to live up to the ferocious energy in the first song, although all were OK. I liked the cover of Heaven and Hell, but is was too close a copy of the original, not much effort put into personalizing it. Also, the band experiments with several different vocal styles, none of which worked for me.I'm sure this sounds like a negative review, but I still like the groups music and will be very interested in their next album. I would suggest to the band that they look for a new producer to try and make a more cohesive effort next time."
4,One of the best doom bands last year,"I really like this album. It is not so gloomy like some other doom bands, but the guitar riffs are very good, heavy and easy to remember. But, alas, on the other hand, there is not that much variation in the songs, even if the compositions are very well done."
4,Heavy as HELL!,"I am going to give you a list of all the pros and cons. PROS:heavy as Pantera,powerful and easily understood voice,very dark,long songs and intelligent lyrics.CON:too repetitive."
4,Perfect for areas with fire restrictions,"One of the only things preventing me from camping right now are the current fire restrictions in place in the near by National Forests. Who wants to go camping without a campfire to sit or stand around after the sun sets? So, I started looking for a solution to this problem and decided on the Fire Dancer. This was definitely the right decision! It's portable yet not too small. I love the fact that it's self contained. The top screws on snugly using the carrying handle and the hose wraps nicely around the base. The coolest thing about this propane campfire is that fact that the flame actually dances. You can be mesmerized, like watching a real campfire! The only reason i gave it 4 stars is because the ceramic log kit is cheesy, but I'll use it for now."
5,Miss Flamenco,We love it! We saw it last year at the camp ground. I got it for my B-day and enjoy the simple use and small size. When there is not fire pit or fires are not allowed that's the winner!
5,It is exactly what I was looking for.,"It works great,the only thing Idon't like is the cheesy fake log, it would much better with the fake logs that come with gas fireplaces."
4,Fun to have easy to use,"Use it at campgrounds all the time. Everyone likes it, wants to know how to get it. Lots of heat when on high. Just note if you turn off the gas, it takes time for fire to go out. Lots of gas in hose, so just make sure it's set on stable surface and let fire burn completely out before stowing it!"
2,You think you may have something after the first song...,"Because, in all honesty I was impressed with the band after hearing that song for the first time. However, upon hearing the second... and the third... and the fouth, and etc. I realized that this melodeath album I purchased based on the advice of another simply wasn't cutting it for me.To put it blatantly, the album bore the heck out of me.Want me to put my finger on it? I can't. It could be anything from the lack of variance in songs, to the lack of something new about the band to set them apart from all the others bursting into the scene along side them. To me, it just seemed like plain old melodeath, that would have been somewhat acceptable 1 year before Slaughter of the Soul came out."
4,A very insightful book,"I really enjoyed this book, I thought it was very insightful to economics and was quite interesting. The language, and visuals portrayed are a bit advanced, so if you're not up on your vocabulary, you might want to have a dictionary handy. Overall it was a good read."
5,"Decent Read, useful for those moving to an advanced level of understanding",I used this book for a graduate class on public finance. The price was right and all the students had access to the electronic copy. The book content was very good for our purposes and allowed me to discuss the topics without the need for an overly expensive text book.
4,Pretty cool,"These are cool and pretty comfortable and work well protecting each toe but they take a little getting used to because the seams basically trace your toes, they go between each toe and across the tips and feel a little weird at first."
4,Spreading the toes,"I was supprised how much better my feet feel in these socks, even without wearing my Vibram Five Fingers. The socks are fine."
4,Comfortable,I bought these to hike with because I was getting blisters in between my toes. These really helped by keeping my toes off each other. I have recently bought Vibram barefoot runners and was getting a little chaffing at 1.5 miles. I added these socks and did 5 miles with zero issue.
5,great socks,"i bought these socks at first because they looked funny and was curious so i thought i would give it a try. It did take some time to get used to having my toes being separated, but after a while, i don't even want to take them off. It did get kind of embarrassing when i take my shoes off in front of people though. but overall, i do like these socks."
2,"Fit and Quality Just ""OK""","The largest size I've ever worn is 8M (stilettos, flip-flops, athletic shoes, flats, etc.) from varying brands. According to Injinji's Web site, size small fits up to size 8 shoes in women, but it is short, causing a very snug, somewhat uncomfortable fit. As a result, I've only worn them once to exercise. I was worried that they may slip underneath but they did not. However, the fit and whether or not they will stay in place is definitely not a good thing. They also came out fuzzy in the wash. I'm keeping all six because the inconvenience of returning them to Amazon is too much."
1,not for big feet over 12 inches,"i have a size 12 foot, the holes didnt even come close to fitting my two big toes on both of my feet. good for small people or women."
3,Shop Around,"I bought my first two pairs of injinji performance micros when I bought my first pair of vibrams, from travelcountry.com. The pairs from travel country are amazing, they would get a 5 star review.Now the ones I just bought from amazon feel and look like completely different socks. I bought 2 mediums from amazon. What I got was one Medium and one pair that seems to be a large (though it was in medium packaging of-course). They don't fit as well in my vibrams as well as my original pair and the fabric doesn't seem as good either. the long and short of it, I believe what I got are fakes. Who would have though socks would be counterfeited?I definitely recommend injinji socks for vibram five fingers but I would seriously consider ordering from either the vibram website or another vibram authorized dealer such as travelcountry. I rolled the dice buying from amazon and I regret it."
5,Great socks!,At first the socks feel a bit constricting but after 5 minutes you can't feel them at all. I just ran 5 miles and had no blisters or sore toes for the first time. I am buying two more pairs now :)
5,Great socks for vibrams and normal shoes,"I wear these with my vibrams and love them - have never gotten a blister. I've also used them in a bunch of races, as much as 100 miles, and had great luck. However, if you're doing a race that's going to be really wet or have stream crossings, I would recommend getting one of the higher cut ones since the lowest cut one can fall down when it gets really wet, which is annoying and makes heel blisters more likely."
2,Not great,"I am a big vibram 5 finger fan but these socks are not great. Got them to reduce foot moisture/sweating when wearing the vibrams but these made it worse. Do not recommend for that purpose. Ok for just wearing around the house, but I'd rather go barefoot."
4,Great socks for Skeletoes,I bought these socks primarily b/c I recently purchased the Fila Skele-toes. These socks fit great with them. It takes a tad longer than putting on regular socks but that is expected.
5,Great socks,"I have only had these for a short time, but after a few hours of wearing them to get used to the extra material, I am really enjoying them. I use these socks not only when running, but for basketball and tennis too. Works great so far, and I am going to buy more of them."
4,"Good, but beware of the sizing.",I ordered two different kinds of toesocks from Injinji. I got a mini-crew pair and these mico toesocks. I wanted to try the different styles and weights. What I didn't expect was the difference in size. These were much smaller. They are supposed to fit women's shoe sizes 6 to 8 1/2. I am a 6 1/2 and I can barely make them fit. Someone who is a size 8 could never wear them.I am happy with them; they do what I wanted them to do--prevent pinch blisters on my toes.
3,Toe length too short,"The toe length is too short, and feels like the sock is trying to separate my toes from my foot. Extremely uncomfortable. Unfortunately, I can't even wear these around the house. Sorry injinji."
5,QUALITY PRODUCT,"I wear these type socks and footlets for relief from one toe that has started going under the toe next to it. On my feet for hours and it gets painful. These are well made, keep toes straight (like when I was younger) and keep me going painfree. I wish this company made this style, little footlets that don't show with dress shoes."
4,Good Product,Good Product. Turned out just as described on the site. Would recommend it to everyone. I think its a little overpriced. Similar products available at much lower rates.
2,Quality varies...,"I bought two pairs of these to wear with my Vibram KSO sports. One pair ripped between the big toe and second toe after one day of use. According to Amazon.com's return policy, you cannot return worn items... I didn't read this beforehand and sent them back.. So I am out more than $20 and without socks. Do yourself a favor and buy these socks from your local retailer. I got a few pairs at my local REI and they are of higher quality and stretch and fit properly. My new socks are Injinji also, but are of a different design. Maybe the seller is selling older stock socks.. Your mileage may vary, buyer beware."
2,Not recommend for long distance running.,"I bought this for my wife, she used it for her half marathon run. On mile 4 to 5 she had develop blister in between her toes from too much friction. It's a great idea, but didn't really work for long distance running. I had on my Thorlo's running socks and I had no issue with blistering. Would not recommend for a marathon."
3,pricey socks,"I ordered these socks to wear with my Vibram Five Fingers shoes. I'm not a runner (or even athletic for that matter). I just thought it would be a good idea to wear socks with these shoes to delay the inevitable odor that will follow wearing them. Well, there's no doubt that didn't work out in my favor. But, there is a noticeable difference in how comfortable the shoes are with the socks as compared to going comando. I wear the shoes daily and the socks really make the shoes feel better for me. They are kind of pricey, though. I assumed I would receive two or three pairs for the price I paid, but was disappointed when only one pair showed up. All in all, the socks fit great, feel great, and make wearing my favorite shoes more comfortable. But the price and the lack of odor protection keep them from being a 5 star product for me."
5,Great quality!,"injinji Micro Toesocks are very well made. The material seems to very comfortable. They stay in place, without slipping down in my shoes"
2,Not so great,In the process of training for a marathon and keep getting a re-occuring blister on my second toe. Podiatrist recommended trying these socks.......worse thing i could have done went for an 8 mile run trying out these new socks and after that had a blister on the bad toe but also got more blisters in between my toes... one toe actually has two blisters now. Really wanted to love these but they did not work... instead of one blister i now have 5 don't waste your money I will stick with my Nike dri fit and some good band-aids.
4,Expensive but functional,"Great socks but why do they have to cost so much? Am I paying extra for the toes? Helped keep my boyfriends feet warm on cold morning runs, so I'm happy."
5,Great distance running sock,"I bought these socks for my Five Fingers, but ended up running a marathon in them. I was having bad blisters on the tops of my second and third toes after long runs (15+ miles) and gave them a shot. For the marathon, I also sprayed some second skin (I forget the brand) but afterwards I had no blisters anywhere. Very happy with these socks. (As an aside, I also own the lightweight version of these. Great for Five Fingers, too loose for regular shoes.)"
5,GREAT!!,"At first I hated these socks because I never wore toe socks and the only reason I bought them is because I bought me a pair of vibram toe shoes. After awhile I got use to it being between my toes and now I love them and are by far the most comfy socks, while second best. Asics are the best but these are better than any Nike socks."
4,Toe Pockets,"I bought these socks on a lark for my husband and myself. It is a truly weird feeling to have your toes separated from each other in this sock. Still, we enjoy wearing them on days when we know we will be walking around for most of the day. The separation really does cut down on blisters. Fair warning, my husband found these socks to run a bit small, so if you are at the top end of the size range, go for the next larger size."
4,soft and comfy,"this sock is very light weighted, comfortable and easier to slip on then I thought. Perfect fit with my new Vibram, loving it!"
4,They are Good.,"They were a little higher on my leg than I like, so I gave them to my father and he loves them.He is a runner and they work perfectly for what he needs them for. I definantly recomend them to anyone who likes socks a little taller on your leg."
3,Very soft and comfortable ... but,"These are very soft and comfortable socks; however, the spread the toes a bit too much and slip around on my feet. I do sweat a lot and these were causing some blisters on my feet. Inside my Vibrams, my toes were spread uncomfortably to wide. I do have a wide foot and very high arch which may have been part of the problem in my case."
5,Injinji,"These socks were for my son, who runs lots of races. He was getting blisters on his toes, but with these socks, no more blisters. He wears them under high quality running shoes, and under minimalist shoes. He's very happy with the socks."
3,SOcks,these socks are GOOFY! they are made for the shoes that have toes. My fiancé didn't like them because they aren't soft at all. they feel like rubber and don't let feet breath.
5,Love these socks,These socks are great. I bought them to wear with my Vibram Five Fingers. They are soft and fit nice and snug and don't bunch up and the heel doesn't ride down as I run. Great find!
4,Fit Is Great.. But They Wear Down Quickly,"I agree with the other reviewers that these don't work well with my Vibram KSO's. The injinji liners work ok with the Vibrams but the performance micros are too thick.That said, I love the feel of these socks. They promote good toe separation and are very comfortable. I did a mud run in them and they held up well, prevented blisters, and wicked enough to not have my foot be a wet, shredded mess at the end.The one criticism is that they wear quickly. After only a few washes and light/casual usage around the house and on interval runs some of my socks are becoming thread bare around the midfoot and heel."
2,Too Small,I am a women's size 7 with normal to narrow feet and these socks are really too small. I have to really stretch them to get them up over my heal and that causes the individual toes to pull back and cramp my toes while the seams dig into the tender spaces in between my toes. I actually can't imagine these socks fitting someone with a size 8 foot. If I were to order again I'd probably get the ones that come up higher on the ankle in the hope that I wouldn't have to stretch them so much.
2,weak seams,"While these socks are very comfortable and work great with the barefoot running style of she, they are are flawed in I had holes developing at the seams in less than a month, not cool for socks that run at $12 each."
3,"Interesting, but not worth the money for casual runner","I run about 12 miles a week and I don't see any significant improvement over other quality running socks. It may be worth it if you run a lot more than I do, but for the casual runner, save your money and buy different."
5,Best sock I've ever owned -- hands down.,"I bought these socks on a whim because I just purchased a pair of Vibram FiveFinger Bikila LS toe shoes. Love the shoes, but I am not wearing these socks with them because the shoes are skin tight without the socks. I have ended up wearing my injinji's with every other pair of shoes I own. I currently have 3 pairs of these socks and will be purchasing more very soon. I will never wear a regular pair of socks again. I am officially a toe-sock convert. They allow a greater range of motion and completely eliminate toe bunching caused by socks."
4,Perfect with Vibram Fivefingers,"Love these; makes wearing my Vibram Fivefingers much more comfortable. Only complaint I have is that they started pilling after just a few washes. Otherwise, they're great."
3,Better than regular socks,"I use these when I know I am going to do a lot of walking like on vacation, walking through a city for a day, etc. The socks really make the sneakers fit better for me. They are kind of expensive though. I could buy two or three pairs for the price I paid, but my feet feel much better at the end of a day that involved a lot of walking if I use these. All in all, the socks fit well, and make wearing my sneakers fit more comfortable. The rice and the lack of quantitiy discounts keeps me from giving 4 stars."
3,Impressed by the design n idea but NOT Quality,"I have been impressed so far for those products I have bought from Amazon. Although this is not the 1st to failed me. Idea and design of this products are what convinced me to go for. Once received I knew I would have ended up having some quality problem soon based on the material of fabric I have touched. Sadly, it is true. Again if based upon design and idea of this products then'5 Stars' to me but after couple of use (2-3 times) then I started to see some holes in this products. Sigh. Hope you will come up with better material next time. Really like the design."
3,got them fast but product not so hot,"great with the shipping time, but the product itself isnt the greatest in the world. they work, but maybe its just how the shoes and socks work."
3,just cool,"I love these and use them often. either while wearing regular shoes, my 5 toe shoes, or martial arts shoes.."
4,Great,"I like the socks. They work well with the vibrams, but they attract a lot of fuz and hair. That annoys me, I feel like they are never clean even when they come right out of the wash."
2,bad quality,"I Ordered six pairs of this sock. Thinking that we get what we pay;this should be a wonderful sock. It fits well, but one pair came with a role in it, and after one wash they look very,very old. I ordered white, and they never became bright white after just one use. The company never asked for a feedbak,what makes me wonder if they care at all for the quality of their products."
3,Not bad.,"These socks work well with my five finger shoes. They are a bit pricey for socks but I really can't wear anything else. Geez, how do you review socks?"
3,Fine but expensive,"The case is extremely thin. I like it: it's surprisingly durable and is definitely form fitting. Still, for the price, it's not necessarily a great value. I will probably get an otter box case on top of this to actually protect my phone..."
3,TOESOCKS,"I GUESS THEY'RE OKAY, BUT I COULD NOT GET THEM ON MY SIZE 11 FOOT.... SO I DONT KNOW FOR SURE"
3,GOOD PAIR,"GOOD PAIR, FEELS SO GOOD ON THE FEET, BUT DONT PLAN ON BEING IN A RUSH TO GET THESE ON, IT TAKES TIME TO GET THE TOES INTO EACH UNIT, PULL THESE OFF BACKWARDS AND WHEN U REVERSE THEM BACK AND TRY TO GET THEM ON THE TOES U HAVE TO PULL OUT ONE BY ONE, BUT GET THESE ON AND THE FEEL IS PERFECT."
5,:),"Great toe socks, my sisters bf loves them. He wears them all the time with his toe shoes, and they are super soft."
5,very nice,"Finally some toe socks for guys withh big feet. These are wonderful and comfortable, will be getting more of these."
3,"Fits great, but 1 complaint","These work great in my Vibrams! My one complaint is that I had them on when playing the sports game on XBox Kinect and the socks got all fuzzy on the bottom (my other pair of gray ones have not had this happen, but I haven't worn them playing Kinect), so I am not sure of the overall durability."
5,excelent,"very good product, excellent time and attention me dieron respuestas a mis preguntas and get my order in the time ordered"
5,fast,Item was Shipped fast and it was exactly what I expected and my son loved the socks thank you very much!
3,Comfortable but...,I've been wearing these for a week now in my Fila skeletons and they are comfortable but I do not think the toes will hold up. I think the toes need extra reinforcement. They are ok for a walkabout but I would not recommend for anything more rigorous. Post script: 2/21/2013. I was right they do not stand up to day in day out wear.
4,Excellent with five fingers.,I ordered these to reduce some rubbing in my Vibran FiveFingers and to keep my toes a bit warmer in cold weather. They work well in both regards. I would recommend these to friends.
5,Five Toe Review,"I absolutely love these socks, they are the most comfortable socks I've ever worn in boots or cross trainers. I need about 10 more pair."
5,toesocks review,If you own Vibrams these are a must. Vibram sold toesocks are over priced. Injinji makes microfiber in all sizes compatible with Vibram socks and are more affordable. Especially since my Vibrams with shipping took me over 100 bones.-Sgt of Marines
3,Works Well With Vibrams Over Short Distances,"After reading other reviews on Amazon about toe socks for Vibrams, I noticed that several reviewers recommended getting a size slightly smaller than your show size so the toes on the sock don't bunch up while running...which is what I did. Unfortunately, I've noticed that while running distances of 3-7 miles in cold weather, the socks slide down from my heel to underneath my arch. I did not have this issue when I ran in warmer weather. This is annoying to say the least. HOWEVER, I have not tried a larger size to see if its a sizing issue or a sock issue.PROS:-Work with Vibram KOS's-Lightweight-Absorb a LOT of water (sweat or otherwise)-Keeps your feet cool (as do Vibrams)-No problems with blisters (ran without socks for a while before I bought these, so newer runners might get blisters)-Don't take up much roomCONS:-Slides down heel in cold weather/over distances"
3,Good suck but not for 20 milers,"The type of suck is sooooo great for the toes. I do like that the socks separate the toes since it dissipates the heat. The only concern is that after about mile 18 I started to develop a hint of a blister on the inside of my left foot. I am not sure if it was the shoe, the sock or if it was just the sock is not fit for long dinstances."
1,Toes too small,"I am an average size 11, but the toes are so small that the socks pinch into the skin between the toes. They are unwearable."
1,Waste of money,"dont waste your money, you'll wear them one time and then make an appointment to have your head checked for ordering something so trivial."
1,Tore within two washes,"I got these socks based on the stellar reviews here. I have been very disappointed with them. The socks tore within two washes. I am not sure whether the samples I received were bad, but needless to say I am not happy with this product. And for $10 a pop, these should have been more than rugged."
2,very small!,I have very small feet. I generally wear a size 5.5 to size 6. I bought these socks to wear with my vibram five fingers and to wear as running socks in my regular sneakers. The small is so small they slide down my heel and I have to keep pulling them up. They are basically useless to me. I own three other pairs of the toe socks from injinji and they are great but they are not the crew socks.
5,For the KSO Trek Vibram Five fingers,"I have had a pair of vibram five fingers KSO treks for about two months. I love the shoes which recently started causing blisters in certain areas. I broke down and started buying these socks which have not disappointed. They have eliminated the foot odor in these leather shoes as well as provided a comfortable snug fit for me. Granted, all feet are different and I tend to have some long skinny toes. These stretched to fit comfortably. They seem to be made of quality material.I would not run around sock-footed in these since carpet will ultimately wear holes in them. So far I have machine washed them multiple times and they have retained their shape without stretching. These socks are great to use even if you do not have a pair of vibrams. They work well in regular shoes. I have even worn them in insulated boots."
4,"Great, but a bit thicker than I had hoped for","I bought these with the intent to use them for my Fila Skele-toes shoes. They work well, albeit they are a bit awkward to get on and off, but what would you expect? It took a couple runs to break in to fit in the shoes well, as the fabric is a bit too thick for use with toe shoes that are properly fitted. However that being said once my shoes stretched out a little bit they are now working great. These are certainly essential for anyone with toe shoes who goes running, they have eliminated blistering and work fantastic for running on the beach."
4,Great for 5 Finger shoes,"Bought these for my 5 finger shoes, really helps for the comfort of the shoe and keeps odor at bay. Easy to get on and makes the shoes easier to get on also."
2,Guess I have long toes?,"So I guess I have long toes or something because the toes on these socks are FAR shorter than they appear in the image. Front-to-back these feel great (I wear a size 9 shoe), but I'm going to have to cut off the ends of the toes in order to make these fit."
3,Almost exactly what I needed,"I just bought (and totally love) Vibram shoes. But going barefoot inside them leads to a stink like you wouldn't believe. These socks were exactly what I needed, after a tiny adjustment: I had to cut the bottom of the space between the 2nd and 3rd toes, so that the socks stopped cutting into me there. Maybe I just have weird feet, but they didn't work for me unless I did that.The socks look a bit odd now, with a hole there, but the still feel awesome, and they make the Vibrams perfect."
5,I really like them!,"I bought these socks to wear with the Merrell barefoot model shoes and it was very conclusive. The toes feel great separated like this, it's a bit like not having socks at all. I was afraid to be cold but after walking for a while my feet were hot and at ease."
4,Great socks,"light socks, breath well, great for summer time, originally got my wife some, now i have a few. lol. The price is a little much, but worth it."
2,not up to expectation,"I had this same performance of Münchinger on vynil discs. Hoped to receive a sort of re-mastered performance on DVD, in short hoped for a better execution. But the sound is in mono and very flat.In short: am not satisfied."
2,Ehhh.......,"Not worth it to rent unless you're really hard-up. Cheap, quick, and barely entertaining. If they had clothes on this would have gotten one star or less....."
1,Made in China,"My dog liked these treats, but then I figured out it was made in China. Not worth the risk, so not buying again."
5,Good for out of shape people,This DVD is for those of us who are not young gym bunnies. It's a good way to ease into yoga.
2,Poor Video Quality,"I have found that it's difficult to even pay attention to the content of this DVD due to the poor video quality. It's not very often that one finds a DVD that looks like this. It's as though someone recorded it from a non-HD tv station onto a VCR tape. There's just no reason to have to watch video like this anymore. It's also apparent that there must not have been second takes, as there are mistakes made by the instructor. Very disappointing."
4,Yoga 101 Workout,"I was looking for something a little more intense, however, this is a perfect beginners workout. In fact, there are a few poses that were difficult for me as I am fairly new in the yoga experience. This artist is extremely knowledgeable and a good choice for those of us who are beginners or past the ""spring chicken"" phase of life. An added benefit to all of her DVD's is that the price is more than reasonable."
4,Yoga 101 Workout - Prop to Poses (Daily Routines/Beginners),It is a good workout for those who are not physically able to do a lot. I really am using it.
5,Just damn near perfect.,Got to me quick and timely. Used them to mount a 130/90-18 on a spoked rim with inner tube. Never came close to biting the tube. Enough length for leverage if you take small bites. Nice size to carry.
5,train obsession,"first off, i love trains, the sound of rumbling trains in the night, anything to do with trains. ive always loved the idea of hopping freight trains. there aren't very many books on the subject. ive read hopping freight trains in america which is a great manual if you are planing on taking a ride. this book gave an inside view on what its like to live the tramp life. after reading this it made me want to ride the rails even more. great book."
3,So So,"An ok read but should have been titled ""Suburban kid wants to dip his toe in reality"". When you read, you see how awkward it is to have somebody from suburbia that has obviously never been beat down, shot a gun, seen a hooker, etc trying to fit into this life. It reminds me of the liberals in California throwing parties for the Black panthers thinking that they are doing some good, while all along the Panthers are blowing the money on dope and Cadillacs OR how white youth are imitating the miserable life of inner city black youth. I think people are drawn to that which they fear so that they can try to conquer it. Anyways, I give the author credit for trying to be a modern day Jack Kerouac. The book was a little light on delivery though."
4,An eye-opener,"Although twenty years isnce it was first published, the book has a timeless aspect that is quite moving; essentially, Rolling Nowhere is an indictment of how the most wealthy, powerful and materialistic nation in the history of human civilization treats those who have fallen through the cracks. As taken in and enthralled as I was by the author's experiences, I was in the end more saddened than anything alse."
1,Bad Shoes,"When you get these shoes/sandals, they won't look anything like they did online. They are very cheap looking and not made very well. Now I know why they are trying to get rid of their stock at such a discounted price. I took them directly to my local Champs Sports store and exchanged them for a nice pair of Nikes. Don't waste your time on these cheap shoes."
3,Very Good product.,Worked as expected. I recommend it to everyone.. I used it every day one a day. It has helped me with my sleep.
3,"Good, but not the group's best","This is a very good album, as would be expected from a group as talented as this one, but it doesn't quite make it to the level of ""Soup of the Century"" or ""Heart of Uncle"" in my opinion. ""Xamenh Evtexia Fizn"" is tons of fun, and ""Musafir"" is a captivating ballad, but the album as a whole lacks the cohesiveness of the two aforementioned albums. This is an album best suited to ardent 3 Mustaphas 3 fans."
1,Never received item!,Avoid this seller. I have sent multiple emails and only gotten 1/2 the order. There are much better vendors on Amazon. Avoid this one and go with with the other vendors.
3,"Good for travellers, not much else","This is a short book and well written, however I found the information in it to be more helpful for people who are looking for a short 'cram session' before they go to a holiday or business trip in France, and much less for someone who wanted to start to systematically learn this wonderful language and culture (like me).Excellent for short term gains, but get a more serious book if you want to become fluent."
5,Digitech BADMONKEY,"OK...here's the drill...a lot of semi-pro or pro musicians cringe at the thought of putting a Digitech ""anything"" in their signal chain. But recently, I went to a local venue, and heard this guy playing super transpearent lead guitar lines, while maintaing the sound of his single coil insturment, but it sounded like tubes being overdriven, all from a 15 watt amp. I snuck a peak at his modest pedal board....and there was a Badmonkey!This pedal took the place of a handmade pedal on my board that was 5 times the cost! YouTube has some great vid reviews. But this will be the best $49 you'll spend on a pedal desinged to maintain the integrity of you guitars unique sound, yet give you enough dirt/grind to feel like you're playing through a Narrow Panel Tweed at 10. This is NOT for Metal Heads...this is strictly old school, blues, country or jazz/fusion only. Combine it with a ZD or TS, and it's magic on a budget!DigiTech DBM Bad Monkey Overdrive Guitar Effects Pedal"
4,It's a good pedal but it's actually a decent preamp,"I think that this pedal is a good value as an overdrive pedal but its speaker simulated 2nd output makes it a great value as a stand alone guitar preamp!I plugged it into my DAW and listened on my KRKs and was impressed by its sound. The overdrive is quite good. No, it can't hold a candle to my J. Rockett Pedals Alan Holdsworth Signature Overdrive but at $48.00, it's an absurdly good buy."
3,Decent Book for the Novice,"Ok this is a very useful, detailed guide. If you are new at looking for employment with the FEDS this guide is for you. It's very easy to read, well put together and all the information is there on one book. If you are already familiar on how to look for federal employment, know where to go and how to apply, this book could be somewhat useful. In my case I was looking for something that could have tips on improving my chances withing the federal system, unfortunately there are not real tips, just factual information. There is some room for improvement."
5,A MUST READ FOR PROSPECTIVE FEDERAL EMPLOYEES,"If you've ever even THOUGHT about going to work for the U.S. Government, BUY THIS BOOK!! Full of useful information that federal job hunters MUST have to succeed."
4,"Didn't need much, but good reference material.","It's a good book on entomology, but didn't need it much for the class. Still, lots of good info if your having trouble. Wish there were some color pics, though. Good overall."
5,Survival rendered hollow,Louis Begley is able to convincingly write of survival as seen through the innocence and straightforwardness of a young Jewish boy. A boy whose life gradually becomes a web of lies and inward and outward loss. Loss which he will ultimately not be able to ever recover from. This is a short book with appeal to adults and young adults given the young protagonist and appropriate content.
1,So so...,"I bought this book being a great admirer of Tadao Ando but found it to be of no help to me. The pictures are not well printed and I find them to be too grainy or simply out of focus. Some of the photos are far too dark or too bright and therefor details of the building are lost. It seems that the photographs are ok, not great, but are not well delivered in this book as they have a greenish hue."
1,waste of money,"i hate this game. we bought it 2 years ago and i hate it. i am 12 and this game is nerve wracking, when i'm not on the edge of my seat, screaming at it or failing 10 times in a row i'm in tears over this STUPID game. DO NOT BUY THIS. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. if you are wise, do not want you or your children in tears or screaming at the game, or slamming you game boy into the wall or taking a hammer and breaking the game. do not buy it."
1,Don't plan on being up and running very quickly,"Even as a professional software engineer, I found this book poorly organized and terribly written with numerous forgettable tangents on the history of EPOC, lousy application implementation guidance (even if you can get the examples to work), and a structure that assumes that you are reading the book front to back (remember - this is over 1000 pages). So, get ready for a few nights burning the midnight oil. The installation CD is truly a hacked together job. And don't plan on using the book as a reference for any EPOC Java work - it treats Java implementations as a minor afterthought. I hope the authors produced better documentation for their solutions than they did for this book. Save your hard-earned money."
5,Part 3 of the book is best,"The best part for me is Part three of the book, it presents a realistic implementation of Battleship game using client server, it covers all the interesting aspects in a very clear and incremental manner.Chapter 18 is paricularly good, it starts from a very simple active object, explains how it works, then moves on to the pattern, also explains why he favors one approach over the other, the mistake he made etc.Part Three - Communications and Systems ProgrammingChapter 16 - Communications and Systems ProgrammingChapter 17 - The Transaction-oriented Games StackChapter 18 - Active ObjectsChapter 19 - Client-server FrameworkChapter 20 - The GSDP ServerChapter 21 - GDP ImplementationsChapter 22 - Full Battleships"
1,Rubbish - better documentation available for Palm + PocketPC,1000 pages of un-user friendly material. Programming for the symbian platform is difficult at the best of times and the supporting material on the website only hinders experienced developers (I have over 10 years C and C++) experience. Some of the material is now out of date and SDK documentation is more helpful for development.Poor documentation is hampering our development efforts. Wireless Java for Symbian Devices is interesting but the Java implementation on Symbian EPOC is terrible.
1,Not Good At All,"I think that the mother in this film showed good emotion and could act but the script, theme and story line were extensively lacking. Not Good At All. A true waste of my dollars, I wish I didn't buy it."
1,my review,"I didn't care for this movie, it wasn't the kind of movie I expected it to B I Thought it was a movie. About women being in love w eachother"
5,As rich as a piece of Viennese cake,The Eyewitness DK guides are beautiful books in their own right--you would enjoy reading them even if you didn't make the trip. The text is well organized and extensively illustrated with artwork and 3-D pictures of the major tourist attractions. The directions are excellent and they direct you to the important things to see at each location.A particularly helpful feature is a section with specific instructions on how to use Vienna's extensive public transportation system including a description of the various types of tickets and pictures of the ticket machines.This guide blows the competition out of the water.
3,"Good maps, but book heavy.","We bought the Insider guides for Prague, Budapest & Vienna after reading good reviews. They were the best for finding where things were. The street index, references to maps, etc. were excellent. Liked the pictures, giving us an idea of what we would see. The only reason to not give more stars is the weight of the book, as it seemed twice as heavy as other guide books and this was a negative. Also this newest edition had wrong times for tour of the synagogue in Vienna and we missed seeing it because of this. Some shops had moved and were not where the book said they were."
4,Good but dated,"This is the guide I recommend for first-time visitors to Vienna. It organizes the city space in an intuitive way, unlike some other guide books I've seen. The photo-based approach really helps people orient toward things they might to see (or not). It also covers some sights outside the city limits, and a few within a day-trip radius.Unfortunately, it hasn't been updated for a while. Some parts of tourist Vienna, especially around the Museum Quarter, have been changing rapidly. Some important destinations are under long-term reconstruction and unavailable for visits. You'll have to do a little online research to supplement this book."
4,Always like these guides,"Never disappointed with these guides. Next will order ""top 10"" books from same company."
5,One Of the BEST games ever,"Alot of times i will have trouble getting into racing games due to 1 or 2 small things that make the game a drag... but this one i have beaten 3 times and still enjoy playiong it!!!!The Cars are excellent (i love the hearse), Physics and Damage are amazingly realistic.... very cool unlockable Videos. Tons of diffrent race modes, and a Very good soundtrack!!!The ONLY thing that i think is a little dissappointing is the fact that SOME of the event types are not playable in the Carreer mode (out of about 25 diffrent styles of events..only about 3 are NOT in the Career mode).I recomend you pick up this game.. if you like racing, and like Demolition derby style play... You will love this game Beyond words!!!!"
4,Test Drive: Eve of Destruction,"I bought this game for my youngest son. Both he and his older brother enjoy playing it. The price was very fair, and shipping was quick."
5,This Racing Spectaular Has Everything,it has demolition derby figure 8 trailer races oh lord when i buy this game im afraid to ask what other crazy events await me in this chaos and mayhem game
5,Good read!,"This was one of the best mysteries I've listened to in a long time--I had the audio version which was well read. I liked the unexpected twists, and every time I thought I had it figures out, another twist would send me down a different path. Well done. I'm looking forward to more stories by this author!"
4,Enter British Colonial India...,"Although I am an avid mystery fan, I also enjoy historical fiction. Ever since reading The Far Pavilions by M.M. Kaye years ago, I have been fascinated by the British Raj and India in general. This is a fast paced and intricately plotted murder mystery set in Simla in 1922. Joe Sandilands, Scotland Yard, is an endearing character Lovely ladies with secrets abound in the story. I enjoyed every bit of it, and can't wait to read the other books in the series!"
2,Regency or mystery?,"Barbara Cleverly writes books set in 1920's India and the golden days of the Raj. This is the second book that I've read from this series, and I am having hard time with them. The autenthic description of the days long gone are the best part of her books. The trouble starts when her wooden characters just aren't able to carry the story. She seems like a Regency novel writer trying to switch to a more lucrative genre. The plots are convoluted but contrived, and her twists leave a lot to be desired. Mystery just doesn't seem to be the natural field for this author."
4,Time of Nonsense,"The book is loads of fun to read and I enjoyed it a lot. It is, however, one man's opinion and should not be taken as the only way to view most modern worship music; although he does hit the nail on the head on many of the the opinions he expresses."
5,excellent,this is such a great movie.. loved it.. would of seen it over and over in the theater if the prices werent so high... definatly a buyer..
3,problem solved,"i had received my dvd and found that it was scratched. i contacted the seller and was assured that the damage probably occurred during shipment. they have offered to send me a replacement,which is great."
3,Love the movie,Im not complaining about the movie im complaining how i special ordered it and i got it 3 days after it came out I could have just picked it up at the store that night.
5,The Twilight Saga,I downloaded it on to my kindle and I enjoyed watching it instantly. No problems purchasing or downloading it. Amazon made it easy for me to purchase things like this movie for my kindle.
5,Good movie for the whole family,This movie was very good and the whole family enjoyed it.We can't wait for part 2.I would recommend this movie.
3,movie review,"was a really great movie, my wife really enjoyed it just like she did all of the other ones in the series,"
5,Best of them,"This is by far the best movie of the series and for a first for me, my new very favorite movie. This movie stayed closer to the book then the others and I thought it was great!!Besides the actors, which I adore, the makeup artist was phenomenal!!Billy Burke is heavily under-rated; he was great!!The setting and backdrop was fantastic!!I think Bill Condon will be in very high demand because of his ability to stay true to the writer's work and give it wonderful vision. Very few other directors have this gift.If you have read and enjoyed the books, this movie will ring truer for you than the others.But I still like them too."
2,Missed Moments,"Let me start by saying the books are always better, so it would of been really difficult to out do the book. That said I thought the movie missed to many of the really important moments; especially the more intimate moments between Bella and Edward. Some of those moments came in the way of emotions or ""looks"" between the two but were significant to the story, I felt those moments were quickly moved over or taken out altogether. The movie seemed rushed to me, especially for splitting it up into two movies. I love Twilight and the actors, but this was poorly done."
1,Disappointed,The movie wasn't bad. This is my favorite book in the series and I wad a little disappointed in the translation to the movie. A lot... more than necessary was cut out. But the reason I'm overly dissatisfied is there are no special features... the documentry was cool.. thewedding video was a good idea in theory And that was basically it. This is the only twilight DVD without deleted scenes. Which perhaps is the boat disappointing considering what was cut out.
5,Satisfied,I have been trying to find somewhere to get Breaking dawn for a wonderful price. Finally after looking I found this one and I love it. It was in great shape. The shipping was fast as well.
3,Unhappy with purchase option,"When I was looking to purchase Breaking Dawn, I was unaware that it was video on demand instead of an actual cd. I also did not get the option to confirm my purchase, just when I clicked, it was a done deal."
5,The Best Movie,"The movie was very close to the book, in the sense that the wedding, honeymoon, and birth were captured with a variety of emotions that the people watching the movie could feel those emotions. Also, the soundtrack was spectacular, in the honeymoon they used Turning Page by Sleeping At Last that if you read the lyrics you will be captivated even if you don't believe in true love."
3,I never got to see past the first 5 min,"It kept freezing and I didn't get to watch it-I purchsed it so that I could download it to my own library, but could not (had to use streaming). Got a refund so I'm not mad...but can't rate the video"
5,Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Part 1,I loved it and am really glad to add it my collection.I ordered another copy and will give it to myGreat grandaughter in college.
1,Breaking Bad,"This movie goes beyond bad It's not even worth a rental at redbox. I love Vampire movies but this one is just a lot of tripe. Robert Pattinson has such potential and yet he makes such bad choices in movies. As for Kristen Stewart, she really should give up acting. Her razzie award nomination this year is the only award she deserves to win."
1,"Worst Movies Ever Made, Unless you Need a Good Laugh","This whole series is so god awful its becomes unintentionally funny. Some the horrible acting, the insane storyline, the most horrible interpretion of vampires I have ever seen, this has it all. These movies are best used to make your own Mystery Science Theater 3000 movie and just rip the movie to threads. The biggest laugh of all for me in these movies was it started with vampires attending high school and then hooking up with a teenager. So to boot, these vamps are pedophiles. More unintended comedy. Just avoid at all cost if you want an actual good movie. I recommend the Tru Blood series or the Buffy series for a good vampire show, but this, this is only good for comedy."
1,A big let down....,"Whata waste of two hours. Slow story, predictable plot, and generaly all around waste of time. The first movies were stellar by comparison.It took two hours of a slow story for a marriage...wake me when this one is over."
1,Not a fan,"MY previous review was deleted because some people marked it as spam when I was only giving my opinion. Just for the record...I've seen the first 3 Twilight movies & read the books...SO I KNOW WHAT I'm TALKING ABOUT. I'm just not a fan of this one sorry. Too much hype over a movie. I understand it's a fantasy, romance film, but I'm not convinced sorry. It's my opinion and I don't believe it deserves 5 stars."
1,Oh My Gosh!,"I do not see what everyone sees in this saga. I actually walked out of the theater before it was even finished. The characters are shallow, the story is predictable and the overall feel is one of a teenage soap opera. I am a huge fan of vampires and this is definitely not my cup of tea."
5,Great Movie!!,My granddaughter loves all things to do with the Twilight series. She said this movie is awesome and would highly recommend it.
5,Love the movie,"I love the series! They are great movies, I have watched them over and over again. Well worth buying them!"
3,it was ok,not into the vampir wolf thing. But the movies special effescts kept me watching. The story was ok. one two
3,Lacks the Bite of the Others,"I've watched every one of the Twilight Series movies, and for me this is the weakest. I'm not a teenage girl, so as a long in the tooth male my preference is for action scenes, especially vampire vs. werewolf fights. There's not much of that and not much in the area of special effects either. For me the first hour drags with lots of dialogue and love scenes. The action doesn't pick up until the last 40 minutes or so.The greatest tension is created by the question of Bella's survival. Not much suspense here because as I write this Breaking Dawn 2 is now showing in the theaters. Overall the movie is not bad, and it has its moments. Someone with intensions of seeing the second part probably should watch part one first."
4,"Not a great movie, but that's besides the point","Look, none of these movies have been very good, but they are fun, fairly faithful to the books, and filled with very attractive (and a few even talented) actors.The negatives are easy to harp on (startlingly mediocre special effects, incredibly cheesy dialogue, crazily short scenes and timing that seemingly goes awry), but the question is one for each moviegoer: are you on board for the ride?If you are, you are going to enjoy it; the movie moves along, explores the big emotions of love and jealousy, and it is a critical part of the overall Twilight experience.If you are looking for a good movie and aren't really part of the Twilight universe, my guess is that you won't really enjoy it that much.But if you are the latter, why are you watching the fourth movie?I am looking forward to the final installment."
1,Worst one yet.,"I almost could not finish this one, it was long a drawn out. Really way to much drama, the psychic maid at the honeymoon suite was a little much. The entire first hour was like some bad romance flick. Even the last fight scene was cheesy. Reminded me of the old Batman fights I watched on TV as a kid. I managed to get to the end, what a waste."
3,It's Breaking Dawn,"I'm not really hooked on these movies but I don't mind watching them. Well mostly for the eye candy which is Taylor Lautner. Plus I like Vampires and Werewolves. I do have issues with schparkly vampires but these movies hold their own. The first few were the best. These last two (part 1 and 2) don't seem as good and I didn't know actors could get worse at acting. I thought they only got better? Oh well, C'est La Vie."
4,dvd,"Love all twilight movies, great movie. Bought it as a gift for my daughter she loved it. Great prices as well."
3,Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 1,"I watched this before going to see Breaking Dawn Part 2. I though part 1 was fair, but part 2 turned out to be really good."
1,Ew.,"I just don't get the infatuation everyone has with this movie. The actors are lousy, the special effects cheesy, and the story poorly told. To be fair, the book was not my favorite either but this movie took it to a new low."
3,"It was ok, like the other Twilight moves",I liked this movie just like I liked the previous one. They are good for entertainment and do like the special effects a lot. To me the last one was the best of the whole series.
4,I liked it,"I've seen it a lot of times. As a filmmaker, it's a little slow but enjoyable. I definitely wanted my own copy."
3,its okay,i had to have it to go with rest i do like the extras it is a must have if you liked the otherd
2,only watched to see how it differs from the book,"disclaimer: I usually always like the books better than the movies. however, i have never liked a movie series based on the based on novels this little. starting from the the first twilight movie, i was disappointed. and each new movie in the series has not helped. now i'm watching just to be able to have my own opinion (rather than base it on hearsay), rather than for any enjoyment."
5,Twilight,"Breaking Dawn is a story of two teens gradually growing and facing adult choices, decisions and consequences. Edward and Bella wed, and the adventure ends at a point midway in the book, at the moment she wakes as a vampire. Keep watching. There is a little bit more to the story."
1,Didn't ever get it,"I am sure it would have been great but I never got the dvd, maybe it got lost in the mail or something. Didn't get a chance to chase it down."
3,Dvd's Packaging,i was surprised that the dvd's packaging that simple & ordinary thought its gonna be awesome packagingHopefully Breaking dawn part 2 gonna be different packaging that will be more fancy
5,twighlight dawn 1,"it was great to watch again, I remember watching it afew years ago and it's still as great as ever. I would recommend it to anyone to buy."
5,Twilight Saga,"You either like the movies or you don't. Of course, I do so I am very please with the product and the customer service."
3,Was a decent movie,"Even though I was not able to watch this movie through Amazon (where i originally rented it), because for some reason Amazon couldn't keep a connection any longer than 2 minutes, I will still review it. Took me 2 hours to watch 10 minutes of the movie. Ended up renting it through Blockbuster which had no problem staying connected. The movie was decent compared to the preceding ones. Not as much action as the last movie but it does leave you waiting for the next movie.*SPOILER* In my opinion all the action has already happened in the series, unless the last movie doesn't follow the books."
1,Love the movie but there was something wrong with this copy.,I bought this movie because I loved the books and when the movie came out in theaters I had a newborn baby so figured I would just buy the movie and watch it at home. I was so excited to finally see it but it skipped and wouldn't play some scenes. I was extremely disappointed.
1,Horrible,Just horrible you would think from all the money they make that the quality would be better but nope you would be wrong its horrible the story isnt good and it feels like they didn't know what to do so they just tried to make the puzzle pieces fit
1,HATE dvd packaging!!,"Don't get me wrong i'm a twi fan but.....I got this one from walmart not target. Target was nicer but more expencive. The box is deceiving!!!! I beleived that it would be all cardboard almost like a hardcover book like all the other twilight gift sets. Not so!!! The white case you see in the picture is just hard paper almost a dustcover for the dvd thats inside which looks just like the 13 dollar dvds you see in the store. All thats ""special"" about this version of twilight dvd is that it comes with a fabric poster, that you can't hang with scotch tape but will have to nail to the wall or frame. Frame not included. I'm a collector and have all twilight gift sets from target and was VERY disapointed with how cheap this one was. NOT worth 40 dollars! Wait until both parts get put into a combo pack."
4,Good,The movie was in the plastic cover over the DVD and box but I think a sheet was supposed to be inside the front box cover but was not.
3,Wallmark crepusculo edition,"I'ts ok but may be better, (have standar dvd box and 1 flag) don't have pictures, extras and the audio is (American Spanish and English)........"
2,boring,"This movie took so long to get anywhere I thought I was going to fall asleep. I actually think the first one was better and that's saying something, since it's budget was way less than this one. Maybe they should have not made it two parts, then the honeymoon wouldn't have made me so sleepy. I guess I was hopeing the films would get better, the books weren't bad, but this movie proves there not going to."
4,"Not as good as the others, I hope they go out with a bang with the next one.","I have read books one, two, and four, and I am working on three. I own all the movies (except for this one because it is not available yet). I read this book before I saw the movie so I was looking very forward to it. It was a good movie, however it left out a lot of details that I thought were very important. The honeymoon scene should have been more like the book, and the birth scene should have been less like the book, it was disturbing and gross. They probably left out some of the honeymoon to make it pg-13 instead of R, but that birth scene should have made it R rated! For the first part of the last book, it just was not detailed enough. For me personally, I could have sat through a 3 and 1/2 hour movie at least to have the detail. I hope the last part is much longer and more detailed!"
1,terrible,"The kindest thing I can say about this film is that at least Edward looks less like a mime than before. Bella is as expressionless, dull-witted, and boring as ever. Jacob is the heart of the entire film; without him, there would be absolutely no redeeming qualities to this movie at all. The end was surprising in that (warning: spoiler) Jacob imprinted upon Bella and Edward's newborn, thus assuring her safety from the supposedly murderous wolf pack who manage to somehow come across as pretty cool even though they're supposed to be the bad guys."
1,Borring,"I loved the other Twilight Movies but this one is just dull. If you ever read the book you may remember that about 75% of the book was about the wedding, the preparations, and the honeymoon. It was very drawn out with little real content unless you're into romance novels then you might have found a little more to be interested in. But to make a movie out of that book you could have thoroughly covered the entire book in a single movie. When I heard they were making this a 2 part movie I was dumbstruck as to how they would find enough content to do so. Well they did it by making lots of drawn out panoramic scenes showing dreaminess and all that you would expect out of a medium quality home wedding movie.For as bad as this movie was there's very good potential for the second movie. But this one I would say you could crop it down to 30 minutes and then you'd have a decent Breaking Dawn Part 1."
3,Now I know why...,After watching this installment of the Twilight series I thought it was ok but something seemed to be missing. I then listened to the audio book and realized why. There is so much that was not included from the first part of the book that the film seemed too condensed. Also most of the narative of the book is mental discription rather than event driven (the first part of the book that is) they needed to a better job of showing that.The second film will be a bigger challenge as it is more complex than the beginning. I just hope they don't leave out too much again.
2,Twilight,This movie was terribly acted and the story left much to be desired. Very slow paced. I guess it keeps pace with the others in that regard.
2,Yawn,I know they think we'll love the two Twi-nerds cavorting on their honeymoon but it really doesn't move the story forward.
1,Should never have watched any of these movies...,"While I didn't mind the first three, they had enough action to overcome the poor acting to make them mildly entertaining, and enough plot to make me want to know the final outcome, this particular movie was mind-numbingly dull. Awful. I imagine the finale has to have action, but judging on the trailers I've seen where all of a sudden ""Bella"" is a martial arts expert and is shown to be more powerful than age old vampires...uggggh..."
4,"love the books, movies are not as good, but still entertaining.","The books were a great read. I felt I really needed to see the movies. They are entertaining, but the books were much better. The movies leave a lot out, but are still fun."
1,It's not like I wanted to watch the movie or anything.,"I received this movie in mid November, I choose to watch it for the first time today and when I put it in my laptop to watch it, there was NO picture to it. It is just a pixelated mess. I honestly wish I had not purchased the movie because it is no more than a paper weight...."
5,good and fast,It was in great conditions and it came very fast even a while month before Christmas.Very pleased with it.
1,High fees to Brasil,No vale a pena. O sistema de entrega é muito dispendioso. Fui taxada em 78 reais por uma encomenda de 15 dólares.
4,Twilight,I am not much for writing reviews let alone writing more then a few words and don't like it when forced to so I liked it.
4,BREAKING DAWN PART 1,A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED AFTER I PURCHASED IT THEN SET WITH BOTH PART ONE AND TWO CAME OUT FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE. BUT LOVE THE MOVIE.
5,Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn-Part 1,Anyone who likes the Twilight Saga will like this one. It was beautifully portraid in movie form. And the ending was great!
1,Twilight Saga : Breaking Dawn - Part 1,"The movie was not an enjoyable experience for me. I could not follow the plot. So many speed bumps and detours. The other twilight movies carried me, they flowed with true thirst quenching heroic tales of passion,action,and romance. This movie just did not do it for me.It was just so disappointing. Its like waking up one day and finding out that your wife is cheating on you. I was a fan and now I am not. I have lost that loving feeling."
4,For lovebirds only,"Girl falls in love with guy, girl marries guy, girl goes honeymoon with guy, girl makes love with guy, girl gets pregnant. This is what the storyline is all about. Except that each part of it is made according to every girl's dream: Guy is sickly pale but handsome and loaded, wedding gown is designer tailored, honeymoon is chauffeur driven through the streets of Rio before speedboating to a reclusive private seafront bungalow. Then both swim in birthday suits in open sea under full moon light, passionate love making till the pillows burst and the bed frame collaspe. Everything goes well until guy decides to celibate. Then sex resumes again and girl gets pregnant. Nice movie."
3,When Wolves speak!!!!!!!!!,"When I watched this show I thought the wedding and honeymoon scenes were very well done. I didn't understand how it got only two stars from critics until it got further into the show when Jacob turned into a wolf after finding out Bella(Kristen Stewart) was pregnant and went running off to his wolf pack. All of the wolves started talking to eachother with the actors voices in the background speaking so you knew what they were saying. I honestly had a hard time not laughing it was so dumb that it was funny. The show is a good show, it just wasn't as good as the other twilight movies. It has a very good ending though making you eager for BREAKING DAWN part 2!"
3,just love vampires!,"It is a bit boring, but with a just married daughter it is nice to see the wedding.The cast gets better in every movie.Not Oscar material though."
3,Typical,"Exactly what is expected of a Twilight Saga movie. Continues the series well. Special features are really interesting, as always."
1,"The product is fine, movie was a bomb",I'm not sure which they are asking to be reviewed here so ill review both.Viewing the movie through Amazon was excellent as always. The movie stopped only once which was most likely a bandwidth issue at my house since everything connects and streams over wireless. MThe movie was horrible. Long and not much action our much to the story. Hopefully part 2 has a lot more to it.
2,Too much standing around; not enough good acting.,"Not a very good movie; acting is poor, lacks action. I was a big fan of the books, and this movie is disappointing."
3,Better than the all the previous...,"But this is coming from someone that loved the books but thinks the movies thus far have been really cheesy...from poor acting, directing, and the special effects. Anyway, this one is better but still with many cheesy moments."
2,Boring!!!!,Coming from my girlfriend who has watched them all....Very cheesy and boring compared to the others. Total waste of my time.
1,Twilight:Breaking Dawn I,"feature disc worked,but movie disc did not!had to take a refund&borrow the movie from a friend.I was very disappointed&sad.Sorry!!! I will put on my wish list&hope to get for Christmas."
2,Disappointing,"The actors in these films have the opportunity and the audience to make something incredibly unbelievable at least feel genuine, and I'm disappointed that they don't have the ability. CGI and colors are pretty great though, so there was that..."
2,not as good as the others...,This one was not nearly as good or innocent as the others. Kind of a dark dtheme and way too much sexual content for kids.
2,Damaged DVD,"Whilst the movie itself is OK. Disc one of this 2 disc SE had a chip out of the centre. I was still able to play this movie, however I know over time this will deteriorate so will not be playing too often.Special Features - not happy that there were no deleted scenes, though the 'making of/special effects' documentary was really interesting."
4,Daughter wanted this,Got this for my daughter when it came out. I think she may wear out her new DVD player playing it.
2,Didn't like this one.,"Loved this first 3..this saga was slow, bad acting. How this could be rated PG 14 is beyond me. It was pathetic. If this had been the first Twilight series, I wouldn't have watched the rest. A a grown adult...(albeit a wolf) imprinting on a baby? SICK"
2,Very little storyline made this movie extremely boring,"The bedroom scenes during the honeymoon was interminably long. Similarly, scenes showing Bella pregnant were interminably long. Effectively there was no storyline around these long scenes. Some enjoyment could have been experienced if investment had been made in the storyline. Bottom line is this movie is not worth seeing."
3,The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part I,There was a scene where Edward was cooking breakfast for Bella and she was eating so many eggs that did not appear on the DVD
5,Twilight,"I am, as usual, very pleased with my order. It was delivered in a timely manner and in in excellent condition. If you like the serious I would recommend adding this one to your collection."
1,It should never have been sold,"I have never been so disappointed in a purchase. The movie was green and by adjusting my TV I got a little color, but at best it looked like Sepia. I realize now that what I purchased was used and a rental, but maybe you should have reviewed the movie before selling. $11.44, really? I have returned it and expect a refund, but it really was a waste of my time and my excitement to see the movie again was depleted. I really don't think you (Amazon) want customers to know that this piece of work came from you so I will not check the box to label it."
5,Excellent Movie!,This movie was great I am a huge fan of The Twilight Saga and have watched this several times and can't wait for part 2.
1,damaged disc,i was super excited to watch the movie. imagine my suprise when i opened the package & noticed a huge crack in the disc
3,Purchased as a Gift,"I bought this version of Breaking Dawn for a friend who is a huge fan of the Twilight series of books and movies. I am unable to rate it, other than to say it's a great movie, because I do not know what is inside the package that justifies the higher price."
5,Twilight Continued,"In the first place, this item was well packaged. It arrived on time and was in great condition.As far as the item itself is concerned, I love it! I made the mistake of reading the first book since one of my vices is vampire lore. The books were so well written, that I ended up viewing and later purchasing the DVDs in relation to each one. However, the books are still better because they provide a much richer story."
3,Can't wait for breaking dawn 2,Love amazon instant movies! Breaking dawn was great. The ending is such a cliff hanger. Can't wait for the last one
3,Horrific and very long sex scene,I had a hard time watching this movie as an empathetic person and it was a bit much with the sex scene - really wish I had only rented and not purchased.
