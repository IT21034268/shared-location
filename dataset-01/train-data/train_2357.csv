5,worked great!,I needed a bit more closet room and these bags gave it to me. I am not normally a fan of space bags due to leaks but these are working out great.
4,Amazing,Great room saver for stuff that is not used daily! My husband enjoyed working with me on the project because of the results!
2,Assistive Devices Book,This is a very out-dated book. It would have been helpful to have some review before I bought it. I did not realize it was in textbook form.
1,Didn't work for us,"Wouldn't run on our computer - we got ""Typing Instructor for Kids"" and it works smoothly on our computer and our daughter learned proper typing within a week - years later she is still typing properly."
4,Personal Histories Incomplete,"Book is very interesting as far as it goes, which I don't think is far enough. My great grandparents came to Normanna (formerly Walton), Bee County, Texas, by covered wagon from San Marcos, Texas. My grandfather was born in Normanna in 1875 and my grandmother on the outskirts of Normanna in 1881. I think, to be a book on the centennial of Bee County, there should have been placed much more emphasis on the original settlers of the county.There were a lot of ""old timers"" that were not mentioned in this book. There was a photo of my father and grandfather in the book."
5,Socket,"Only need this occasionally, but is exactly what I needed. Price was better then buying a complete set. Great buy!"
5,You should know this piece,The symphony is greatly overshadowed by the first and fifth. It shouldn't be. It's an outstanding work that showcases Prokofiev's brilliant bipolar composition style (lyrical and romantic to angular and grotesque)while really having something important to say. Jaarvi does a great job here. He gets the Russians.
4,Broken-hearted in Russia,"I took this CD with me to Russia, and the music became fused with momentous emotional events there. The Variations I offered to the ears of a Russian musician who played cello. She enjoyed it immensely.I loved a certain soprano in the church choir in the town I visited. I was spurned by this woman. Did this dispose me to Tchaikovsky's tenderness and suffering? Indeed. The Nocturne especially reverberated in my soul, like liquid moonlight, a balm to my misery; it is played beautifully on this CD. 'Christ Had a Garden' and 'Was I Not a Blade of Grass' are Russian hymns that fit perfectly with the winter wind off the steppe. I love this CD and the memories associated with it."
3,Good Introductory Study,"This little book is meant to be an introductory critique to popular eschatology or ""end-times views"" as they have come to be known. Efird divides his book into two basic sections: historical and theological. He examines both dispensationalism and darbyism in their historical context, then examines what he considers to be the three key themes in popular eschatology--the Millennium, the Antichrist, and the Rapture. The book does not assume any prior exposure to biblical studies and is good to use as a starting place.The book does suffer from its brevity. While I'm certain he has more to say than what he actually said, there are times when he could have elaborated a bit more and at certain points you are not certain if he is disproving a particular view or rather just asserting his own without mention.A solid book, all in all."
2,"Super convenient, but couldn't hold up to ""solid food"" smells","I've used the Diaper Dekor since the birth of my now 7-month-old daughter and I loved it to begin with. Very easy one-hand use--step on the pedal, drop the diaper through the flap, very easy to tie off a bag when it became full. In the beginning, it handled odors well too; even smelly diapers didn't cause problems. But as soon as I started feeding solid foods, things changed. It proved completely incapable of containing the ghastly stench of those diapers. My daughter's room is at the top of our stairs, and the stench didn't just fill the room, it flowed out her door and down the stairwell, so we were treated to a powerful whiff every time we walked upstairs. I took to leaving her window open and the fan on to air out the room during the day and emptying the pail before bedtime at night in order to prevent it from stinking up the house. That lasted a week -- I just bought a new pail (a Diaper Genie 2) and I hope that works better."
5,Wonderful diaper disposal system!!,Nothing like the diaper genie..Much better. NO Smell and easy to change the bags. I love that it has a dual purpose. Great use for the money!!!
5,great find,"I used diaper genie with my last child it was horrid! This diaper dekor is a wondeful must have product! I would recomend it to every parent looking for a disposal system. There really are no diaper smells, it holds tons of diapers and is easy to use. Get this my husband changes the bag for me as well as using it to dispose of diapers. I mainly chose it due to the great reviews, believe them this is the best system out there. I hear the bigger one is great too, I bought this smaller model due to limited space in my house and figured it would add nicely to my bathroom once baby is out of diapers"
2,"Schizoid, from ridiculous to (almost) sublime","This is an amazing CD, and I'm not sure how the same artist could have been responsible for both halves. Yundi Li has incredible technique, but the Liszt is easily one of the worst recordings in the repertoire, and one of the worst of any major work for the piano. Bombastic chords, no sense of structure or emotion, and without the slightest idea of tempo relationships. But all of the ""lesser"" pieces are extremely well played! Go figure. No stars for the Lizst, 4-5 for the rest."
4,"Good, but not really enough depth.","I'm rather surprised at the profusion of accolades given to this young pianist's rendering of the sonata, which I also happened to hear 'live', in Singapore. For a twenty-something, I would call it an dazzling virtuosic achievement. But it does not belong to the same class as the renditions by Zimerman, Pollini or Brendel. Hearing these giants play the work leaves me deeply affected, but not Yundi. I personally believe that young pianists should steer clear of this towering, monumental work until they've gathered enough of life's experiences so necessary to bring meaning into the music. I would like to hear Yundi playing this sonata in 10 or even 20 years' time. To his credit, Yundi avoids the empty displays of Lang Lang. But like one viewer said, he should be careful to avoid mannerisms."
2,Unimpressive and utterly exhausting.,"I don't know if these people giving 5 star reviews are listening to the same recording that I am listening to. I'll preface this review by saying that I own 8 recordings of the Liszt Sonata (Argerich, Gilels, Richter, Zimmerman, Horowitz, Arrau, Pogorelich, and Stephen Hough).I feel that the Liszt sonata should take the listener to the extremes of emotion, from the lightest delicate tenderness to fiery passion. I felt absolutely unmoved by this rendition. Yundi Li lacks the light touch for the delicate pianissimo required of this piece. And when I expect the pianist to attack with thunderous force, not much comes out. Something really is missing!Although it's not as horrid as Richter's live recording, it ranks among the worst. Save yourself some money and buy Martha Argerich's sublime recording. Once you hear Argerich's Liszt, nothing else will sound adequate."
4,What a Reconstruction of One of History's Tragedies...,"The Nuremberg affair must always remind us of what man can, and will, do to his fellow man if left unchecked. Persico, tells us straight. And, what a travesty of humankind!More than sixty years later: what television shows us, what books tell us and what remaining witnesses cry.....this title reminds us that war crimes still go on. And, are still a travesty created by men and women.."
5,Excellent book!,"This is the best book I have read on the subject. Persico's prose is well-crafted and readable, and the book is gripping--I could not put it down.I'd recommend this book for anyone just starting out in their quest to learn more about the Nuremberg Trials, and also for those, like myself, that have read quite a few books on the subject."
4,A Readable Account of a Highly Charged Topic,"While Joseph Persico is hardly the only writer to tackle the first, and most important, of the Nuremberg trials of high-ranking Nazis, his book is the one readers who want a well-written, historically accurate, compelling account of this history-making event."
3,A Good Start,"While certainly not a book for someone wanting the details of the IMT trials at Nuremburg, this book does provide a good introduction into the personalities and some of the issues faced by the tribunal and the Nazi leaders on trial for their life. I was somewhat annoyed by having the author start down a certain road (such as Jackson's cross-examination of the German industrialist Schacht), only to have it go nowhere. For someone who knows nothing about the Nuremburg tribunal, its a good start. For details and a more indepth study, try elsewhere..."
4,Simple Guide to the Understanding of Eucharistic Liturgy,"This is a book meant for the everyday Catholic who would like to learn more about the Liturgy of the Eucharist. Written in a simple style without any theological jargon, it is sure to aid active and meaningful participation of the faithful. The book is divided into two parts; one, dealing with the theology of the Mass in general and two, a rather thorough study of the different parts of the Mass. In explaining the parts of the Eucharist the author has included some theology, history and a few notes on practical devotion. The purpose of the book is to make the Mass relevant to the daily life of the faithful. The endnotes on every page are sure to help the curious reader to explore the original documents and books on the Eucharist. Being a priest of the Opus Dei Prelature, the author often refers to the writings of J Escriva de Balaguer. This book should be recommended to every church-going Catholic."
3,Mildly disappointing,"Perhaps I expected too much. I wanted a story of the history of the origin of the elements of the mass, not a how to understand the elements. For example, the fact that the bread is the bread of affliction - consumed after the meal, symbolizing the Christ took on our afflictions. It now fills space on my library shelf, and may end up at the local Public Library."
2,Baby these pruners . . .,"First, let me disclaim. I do not baby my garden implements. They get dirty, they get wet, and I want to just rinse or wipe them up and them put them on the shelf until the next time. So, if you baby your tools, skip this review.If you don't baby your tools, then skip these pruners. The ""spring"" that opens these pruners doesn't quite spring anymore. I have to use my hand to open them all the way. Maybe I attempted to cut too big a branch one day? Maybe I put them up without drying them off sometime? Who knows, but like I said - that's how I treat my garden tools (not overly well). So, I bought these fancy, expensive pruners, and now they are worthless? LIfetime warranty? How do I file a claim? No idea. In the meantime, my good old Corona pruners with the spring that shows still get the job done. That style pruner is what I will stick with from now on!"
5,excellent,"My boyfriend is a landscaper and he swears by these. He had tried others but went back to these, easy to use and sturdy, lasts a long time."
5,Dylon Fabric Dye,"I recieved this order very quickly from the seller, They included free shipping cupon code with next order which was nice. The dye is very hard to find except from them. The instructions reccomend one pack for one pants/shirt pair. I used for one pair of coveralls that was cotton/polyester mix. Instructions reccomend against polyester fabic but it worked fairly well with the blended fabric."
2,"followed directions, did not work","it may have been my hard water of 35, being 15 is average hardness in New Mexico.I was careful, did everything but navy color came out light blue on pure cotton t shirts."
5,Ted Rose Watercolor Art Calendar,This is an outstanding collection of Ted Rose Watercolors. Every image speaks of the magic of railroading.
4,Brain-based Teaching need not upset the apple-cart,Dr. Smilkstein has explained how the brain attaches new learning to the neuron-networks established for the initial concept in each student's mind. She discusses how students are involved and interested when they know they are building new dendrites to connect across synapses and create more knowledge for the student. And she does this with simple approaches classroom teachers can initiate easily without losing the focus the testing mandates press upon them each day. It's worth the read just for the encouragement.
3,Interesting Book,I had to read this for a class. It was okay book over all. If your gonna be a teacher this is a good book to read to help successfully teach your students.
4,BETTER IMPORT REMASTER AVAILABLE,"This isn't the greatest-engineered live recording ever, but there is still a better sounding version available, aEuropean remaster. Wounded Bird primarily deals in non-remastered, LP-EQ'd masters transfered to CD, and this is no exception."
1,awful purchase,"We purchased this air hockey table for our children for hanukkah this year. The order was placed with plenty of time for it to arrive. However, it did not get to us until almost a month late and to top everything off, it did not work!! Once my husband put it together (with directions that did not help at all) there was something wrong with the score board - as soon as you would start a game, it would automatically give a goal to one of the players and then not allow any more scoring for the game. According to all of the paper work, we were to contact the maker. We called the 800 number that was provided and never received a return phone call or speak with a human being.The table is boxed up and ready to go back to where it came from!! the only reason that this review even has 1 star is because I could not submit the review without it - otherwise it would have no stars!!"
1,DMI Sports HT250 6-Foot Table Hockey,"Bought the table used in ""Good"" condition. Found it had been damaged during assembly/disassembly and had to do repairs while assembling. Was disappointed to find that the puck does not go through the slot and depends on sensors to determin a goal. The sensors worked intermittantly, which pretty much made the whole thing worthless."
4,Air Hockey,I like the product for the price. However the fan moter has been reattached three times. The screws keep backing out
1,This book sucks big time,"the author does a very poor job of explaining signals. I don't know why schools have to use such texts when there are so many other wonderful books. The problems at the back of the chapters are many times unrelated to the formulas in the chapters. On many occasions the author skips crucial details, and jumps on to something else. He seems to be in some sort of a big rush to get over it. It gives a student the sense that he is either forced to write the book or is just too bored of teaching signals. I doubt if he even has any patience in real life, let alone writing books. I had to buy another signals book from amazon.com to understand the material. This book alone is a disaster and can never be understood by a beginner in signals, even if he's very good in differential equations and basic EE concepts."
2,Not a good engineering reference,"This is an EE topic so why not relate the problems to EE? I understand that EE relies heavily on math, however this book seems to be designed more for a math class with all the proofs. The material gets very caught up in trying to prove every single equation instead of getting to the point and showing some real world applications or examples. In 5 years after taking the course do you think the majority of EE's remember anything about the proofs? I would say not because in general EE's apply general knowledge of transforms to problems not prove every mathematical nuance of them. I think the author should provide more answers to the chapter problems so students know if what they are doing is correct. What good are problems with no answers?? In the real world there are no solutions manual but at least provide something to reinforce the students work."
4,Excellent Information and Advice,"If you don't feel like you have the time to sit and read a book, but you might be able to find 2 hours to watch a video, this might be for you. Although the information and advice presented is excellent, you'll have to put up with a very boring presentational format. Personally, I prefer Dr. Greene's books or attending one of his workshops."
2,Good message but long and dry,"This is Dr. Greene's first video and although he explains very well, it has a classroom feel which is dry and a bit repetative. Calming the Tempest is another video Dr. Greene created which is shorter and much better at explaining the exact same message. I would recommend Calming the Tempest over Parenting the Explosive Child even though it is the same message."
4,Good value; great customer service from Delta,"I bought this pannier about 6 months ago and used it mostly as a backpack for the first few months. The only problem I encountered was in the way the pannier attaches to Delta's backpack adapter. It attaches at the bottom with two snaps. That's fine if you're carrying a light load, but with a heavy load, the snaps would sometimes come undone as I was riding. I will probably rig up a more secure attachment system.The first time I used the pannier as a pannier, one of the hooks that attaches it to the rack broke. I called Delta and they sent me a new pannier with a redesigned hook that seems much more robust (the new hooks have a triangular base plate).Why a 4 out of 5? Great customer service; seems well-made and durable (with the new hook); great price. However, you might want to think twice if you intend to use it primarily as a backpack."
2,Plastic parts are the weak point,"I commute to work every day and I prefer to carry stuff on the bike than on my person. I have a nice shopping bag type pannier and I wanted something that was waterproof to replace it. This looked like the perfect replacement. Unfortunately it didn't work out. Less than a week after I got this the plastic clips that hold it to the rack broke. I wasn't carrying a large load either. I had carried substantially more in my other pannier with no problems. That pannier had metal parts instead of plastic. So unless you travel light, I would not recommend this pannier."
1,Poorly manufactured,I put this product together just as shown on the instructions. Within hours the legs broke out of the screw holes and now it is trash you can't do anything with itCircle of Fun by Anatex
3,Predictable but Cute,"If you're looking for a fun lighthearted read, this is a good book. Most of the storyline was predictable with a couple of twists thrown in, but if you enjoy desi chick lit as I do, then you'll enjoy it."
1,Invisible (plot)!,"Looking for books in the same genre and style of writing as Bharati Mukherjee or Chitra Banerjee and of course Jhumpa Lahiri, I was highly diasppointed and frustrated to read this trash called ""Invisible Lives"". It is a badly orchestrated fusion of stale Hindi movie masala, a bit of Mills and Boons kind of romance thrown in and a then the sad old and boring story of Indian girls sacrificing love for family!"
2,Boring...,"Ok if I want a B Grade bollywood movie, I'll rent one. At least it will have better clothes, more depth to characters, and at least one nice song. This book was like reading thru a bad script written in a hurry, like junk food that still leaves you hungry. The character development is very poor and the descriptions of fabrics. If you want a visually stimulating book - read the Feast of Roses instead!"
2,Rip off,"""The Mistress of Spices"" was the genesis of a concept, and , Ms. Baearjee shamelessly rips the storyline with no acknowledgement . Same old story- gifted Indian girl in the united states has a super natural ability to peer into people's minds through some cliched Indian medium ( Saris or spices) , till love happens with the white man and destroys the power. Finally girl marries white man and they all live happily ever after.Ever heard of originality , Ms. Banerjee?? And ""mistress of spices"" was much better written as well."
5,A way of life,Priceless. I wish it was available on kindle. One can expand the teachings beyond tea and apply the themes to daily life. Beautiful.
2,I was disappointed,"I was disappointed in the quality of this product. I had also read in another review about a 'black' mark. I had one of those too. The net doesn't fit the ring and just looks pretty sloppy. I never did hang it, just tossed it in the closet."
5,Works suprisingly well,"This performance of Mahler 3 is indeed strangely serene. And I must say, after listening to it for a month or so, that it works incredibly well. I find the music even more convincing played in this way than in the more 'emotional' style that one normally associates with Mahler. If you know for sure that you want that, go with Bernstein. I think, however, that you would be missing something. In Boulez' treatment the music sounds so much more 'objective' and 'inevitable' that I at least am more swept away in believing that we are really hearing 'the mountains', 'the flowers', 'the animals in the forest', 'man', 'the angels', and 'love'.On top of that, the sound is fantastic, and so is Anne Sofie von Otter's singing."
2,Not worth it,"This book is just too contrived and cliched, the dialogue and the prose are stilted and unnatural. Try Don't Think Twice by Ruth Pennebaker, which is a much better, more in-depth book about a teenage pregnancy. A fourth-grader could have written this."
5,Dancing Naked - in my top ten!,"This is a wonderful book - the first novel to make me cry in several years. About a pregnant girl who must decide what to do with her baby, it's heart-wrenching. The author pulled it off beautifully, until I felt I knew the character well enough to find her on the street. I highly recommend this book. It's one of the few good (and modern) teen novels. It's very absorbing. I stayed up half the night trying to finish it! It's definitely one of my favorites."
4,Wow.....,Amazing! I didn't think that the time would come when I would ever cry about a book...but now I realize that my time is now! This book is unbelievable. The characters are so real and the ideas and feelings are all there! A very good read!
4,Canning with Honey,"This is one of the best guides I've found in using honey as a replacement in canning and food preservation. The Ball Blue Canning Book #21400 only goes so far and doesn't get into the level of recipes that Geiskopf does. She has a wide variety of recipes. She also gets into pickles, relishes, dried foods and some dips which don't all require honey."
4,Putting It Up With Honey,"A great little book loaded with clear, concise information about canning,jams/preserves, pickling and drying fruits and veggies using honey instead of sugar. Covers everything from equipment and conversions, to amounts of food needed for a typical family of six. Best of all, the author does not assume the reader has prior knowledge of the process and explains each step."
5,Sweet,This book is awesome. I got this book after someone told me she used honey to can peaches. I think this book is going to be a great asset to my collection. I love canning and always trying to find better ways to can with less sugar. This book is it many more natural ways to can. It has everything in it... I think you will love it too...
2,Only 45 minutes long,It would have been nice of Amazon.com to tell us this BEFORE we purchased it. I can't help thinking the running time was deliberately left out of the product details.
2,wrldtrvlr,Not what I was expecting. This DVD is simply short clips from his shows over the years. I expected at least a little something more.
3,Not as strong as Maher's other DVD's,"I'm a big fan of Bill Maher, and I loved Politicaly Incorrect. New Rules I found to be a bit of a dissapointment; the DVD is merely a compilation of (some) hilarious scenes of Maher's talk show, but I did't like it to be fair. He's trying to score too fast and in a too easy way with this DVD, I think. Still, if you're a hardcore Maher-fan, I guess this DVD belongs in your collection. But where I watched PI and the others over 5 or 6 times each, this one was a one-off affair."
3,A bit thin...,"I think this release lacked a bit of substance, to many ""one-liners"". My first meeting with Bill Maher was the show ""Victory begins at home"", and I think that the other material published on DVD is not as nearly as good as that show. A bit disappointed...."
3,Needs better production,"This had some funny NR, but I have to be honest here, it could've benefited from some extras. This disk is very spare; very short, as well.If you do this kind of undertaking, you better make sure you do a master set by publishing all or most of the good NR. Which would've equalled to about an hour and thirty minutes or more.Overall, I watched this as an abridged greatest hits edition.Still, not bad for the price."
5,IF YOU LIKE GOOD MUSIC GIVE ME A HELL YEAH !,"First off I'd like to tell radio to get your heads out of the sand ! There's a lot of great ""classic"" rock bands making great new music . This cd is proof . Phil and the rest of the boys in Hatchet have turned out a great new live cd set . While the favs are here , such as ""Dreams"" , ""Gator Country"" and ""Flirtin With Disaster "" , the newer tunes kick too ! ""Dead and Gone"" , ""Heart of the USA"" and ""Gypsy Trail"" smoke !! While it's true that there are no original members left , Bobby Ingram has kept the tradition going quite well . And if Danny Joe Brown can no longer perform due to his stroke (God bless him) , then there is no one better than Phil McCormick to sing these songs . There will be a live dvd in the fall from this tour . BUY this CD . You won't be sorry ! HELL YEAH !"
5,Great Live Album From The New Hatchet,"LOCKED AND LOADED is a great live album from the current lineup of Molly Hatchet. The songs are a mixture of vintage classics with the songs from the newer albums. Thank G-d there's nothing from THE DEED IS DONE here, because that album is the antithesis of what this great band is, and has always been, about. This album shows that Molly Hatchet is, and always will be, a great band, no matter who is currently playing with the band at a particular time."
3,It's okay,"It is definitely nice to have all of O'Carolan's tunes available on the same recording, so I won't have to hunt through a bunch of other CDs to find a particular tune, and the price is decent.It threw me, though, to hear the tunes played on a piano instead of a harp or the other instruments you would expect to hear at an Irish session. Also, the tempo seems to be a bit on the slow side (even for O'Carolan tunes, which include a lot of slow airs), and the recording itself is not terribly loud. I have to crank up the volume quite a bit. Overall, it's a good collection to have as a reference."
4,Just what I wanted.,"Very happy with this purchase. They were much bigger than I expected, which is nice for ornaments, so you can actually see them on the tree. They look nice and don't seem like they would break if you drop them. Can't really ask for more than that."
2,"Pretty, but don't look too closely","Seller's e-mail notifications, on-time delivery, etc. were very good. The product itself was a disappointment - low quality. The glass Christmas ornaments I received have a somewhat dull / slightly ""flaky"" (not smooth, consistent) finish with a subtle but noticeable ""line"" where the two glass halves have been ""glued""/fused (?) together. The box, upon delivery, was also slightly crushed at one corner although the ornaments did not break. The ornament box (not the shipping box) is fairly flimsy and cannot be used for storage between Christmases."
5,I love the unique style!,"I have been a Myst fan for many years and have all the soundtracks . . . Robyn's got a fun and mysterious style of his own, which I love and have missed. This album has brought back some of the MYSTery of his music ;) I love the added singing as well and think Moore has the perfect vocal to make it work.Would love to have more!"
5,excellent spy story,"This is one of the best spies stories I've ever read. I don't know what happened with the writer.This was his last book since 1987.Can anyone, or perhaps the author, give me the reason of his disappearance fron the library shelves."
5,Grandmas Curry Recipe,This product has been around over 100 years and it is called for in my grand mother's curry recipe. She also adds ground cardamom to the dish to increase the sweet and savory portion of the spice. It's totally unchanged and a wonderful spice.
2,"go for regular CDs, not Audiofy Chip","There is no doubt that Pimsleur language programs are excellent. I think its program in Vietnamese is also a great introduction to the language.However, this audiofy chip is very bad. The biggest problem is that you cannot use it on MP3 players or iPod. It is designed so that you cannot transfer the files onto MP3 players, so you have to use it on SDcard-capable pocket PCs or your computers. I should have bought the program in regular CDs because it would have been possible to listen to them on my iPod as well as transfer the program onto SD or CF card.The other problem is that this audiofy program is awkward when I need to rewind or fast-forward the lesson. It is very hard to manipulate.Therefore, I highly recommend you stay away from Aufiofy versions of Pimsleur. Instead, go for regular CDs even though it may take up some space and you may need 30minutes to transfer the program to your mp3 players or SD/CF card."
4,Picaro,"These two picaro novels are one of the earliest examples of a novel written in confessional form. Lazarillo de Tormes tells of a poor boy's rise to success, while The Swindler details the fall into a life of crime. Both are well-translated, fast reads that keep the reader amused and entertained even while learning of the terrible hardships facing someone at the bottom of society in the 16th century."
5,"Wonderful translation, brilliant introduction",I find it simply miraculous being able to render into a foreign language such as English both the richness and flavour of the world of El Lazarillo de Tormes. Congratulations.
3,Decent acoustic/unplugged album,"Residing within broadcast distance of WBCN, I have the first 2 Naked discs. The first I highly recommend. The second has a good mixed playlist, with the highlight being the local band Guster's Airport Song. The Scott Weiland track is the worst on the album (no wonder he got arrested the next day). David Bowie's 'Dead Man Walking' is a fantastic demonstration of maintaining a song's harsh tones within an accoustic atmosphere. Every other tune is good quality and no one will be dissappointed although many of them can be found on discs released by local stations. A must for those who enjoy the natural sounds of the guitar."
4,Good follow-up to the 1st Naked disc,"There's a lot to like on this album- great performances by Eagle Eye Cherry, Folk Implosion, BNL, and even, gasp, JewelWhat comes across in this album is that all the artists featured are great performers (except the Scott Weiland song which blows) - the acoustic versions bring out a lot in the songs. I'm not sure I own an album from anyone on this list except Creed and BNL. Nonetheless this album comes along for long car rides and days when something mellow(er) is needed."
4,1983 says it all,I dont watch mainstream movies as they insult my intelligence so here it goes.Chicks hot as hell and dress and undress every 5 or so minutes but thats about as far as it goes. Everything else is artificial and in 19th century France and all music is Russian by comrade Chaikovsky and I am not sure why.But nice to watch at least once.
1,What load of rubbish,"If you like movies that have a thin plot (only sufficient to get the characters from one badly acted scene to the next), amateur actors and little to recommend (apart from plenty of bare flesh) then this is for you. To call it erotic however is a joke.If however you like realistic and well acted stories spiced with with nudity and erotic sexiness then try something like ""Original Sin"" (Antonio Banderas), or Zandalee (Nicholas Cage)."
5,Most helpful parenting book out there!,"What a great way to keep track of my child's day. This comes in handy when talking with my sitter each day. It is amazing how quickly they grow and now I have the pages to see it happen, daily!"
5,All time Great by the Nightingales,This cd is one of the greatest ever recorded by the nightingales. I lead some of those songs myself and always get a standing ovation when i sing them. Also look at the price of the albums now.
2,okay product but a little small,"I have a fairly large face and I found that the Neiko brand dust masks did not provide as much coverage as I would've liked. They were also a little on the flimsy side. I was recently using them while insulating my attic and after I started sweating, I constantly had to change my mask because once they got wet, they would collapse on my face. I guess it's good that 50 come in a box though."
5,A brilliant reading of the Second Piano Trio,"After much searching, I found this recording of one of my favorite of Shostakovich's work: the Piano Trio No. 2. For me, the realization of the fourth movement in this piece is the acid test for any recording and here we have a superb performance. Buy without hesitation."
3,"Rather thin in parts, but not without value","The best and most original parts of this book are the parts about the Halsted-Mueller letters and the letters of Rachel Carson. Other sections, particularly near the end of the book, are vague and repeat ideas written by many other writers on the subject, including Sontag, Yalom, etc. The author's take on breast cancer today is very weak, and does not explore, or even mention, our culture's ever-increasing interest in the cancer/genetics relationship. All in all, the book is not worthless, but it's still disappointing."
4,pants,"I got these pants for a cos play haven't worn them yet. But they look sturdy and comfy. They aren't really anything special. But thats just me. I bought them for a costume, for actually sports pants they seem like they would work great."

5,Fantastic sofisticated looking projects!,"I haven't had a chance to by this book yet, but I did get to skim through it at my local big box of a book store (and it cost a lot more!). The projects were very contemporary, easy, and surprisingly you would be able to find the materials with no problem. A very go read, especially if you are trying to decorate on a shoestring budget."
5,They are the best since sublime and soon to be better,Sublime was the best mix of music i have heard.. i grew up with the band slightly stoopid listened to them play in the quad at PLHS.. they were good then but now look out when everyone knows what hits O.B. brings to the front.. Best mix of mettle ska and because of OB Reggae.. if you dont buy the cd your a fool
5,Best white boy reggae in the land,These guys will blow you away. The next best thing to sublime. Dont pass it up. Songs like Johnny Law and To little To late will pump you up and ones like Struggler will slow you down. A couple of different sounds on one album. Even a white boy from upper middle class America can love this album
3,duke chipped clock,"when we received this clock it was chipped; did not appear to be from the shipping; as it was after Christmas when it finally arrived, my son elected to glue the chipped plastic piece rather than deal with the return. Not a very sturdy clock, plastic is cheap."
4,Worth it for the Andante performance,"Agree with other reviewers.The second movement of the piano concerto is as good as any other that I have heard. The tempo is given room to breathe, and there is suspense as to which harmonic mood will prevail. Thoughtfully conducted, perfectly understated, and movingly played by Dmitri Jr. Put it on repeat and enter a sobering landscape in which little else can comfort."
3,eh.,"I'm about 100 pages into it but Ill review it anyway. It is what it is. a very brief biography and a collection of brief synopses on all 44 films and the plays and videos and TV stuff. It can't decide if its film criticism or biography and unfortunately fails at both. Bummer, I had high hopes."
2,Not their best effort,"How do you follow up with ""Ladies and Gentlemen..."" ? It seems as if this was released so that their next effort will seem that much better. As a release, it's a lazy and leaves a lot to be desired. Only buy it if you feel you need completeness. I never listen to it..."
1,Jason doing an awful imitation of himself,"Coming off of the dreadful ""Abbey Road"" EP, I was looking forward to this live album--however, I feared that it may be another disaster, & indeed it is. These live versions are so over-produced that they sound anemic, not to mention terribly forced. This album actually suffers much like the previous ""F***ed Up Inside"" live album does. It's as if, live, he's trying to flaunt his genius, as if anything he does is brilliant, adding instruments in places that they simply don't fit. Jason's singing sounds totally overblown as well--his emotion sounds phony. There is some great live Spiritualized stuff out there, like on the 2 ""Electricity"" singles, but here, the sterile sound & overly mannered perfomances render the album, especially compared to the originals versions, lifeless."
1,A Self Indulgent Mess,"Even though my Spirtualized listening habits had been tapering off in the months leading up to this release I still was excited to go pick it up. Now I know why I stopped listening to them as much. My worst fears were realized. Bad singing, inane spiritual references, walls of sound over and over, and 2 Cds of this torture! I must say, I could barely stomach the first disc let alone listening to the next one. Pulling off this type of music can be tough in a live setting. It takes talent, which Spiritualized only has in the studio. Lets just say this band is in serious decline. If your looking for a great live album in this genre, pick up Portishead Live NYC!!"
5,Funny and compelling,"This is one of the more compelling analyses on American Culture I have read, and its funny to the point of bringing tears to my eyes in fits of laughter. Some of it hits close to home, but luckily I have the ability to laugh at my sometimes ridiculous lifestyle.Brooks puts into words concepts I have considered, but not necessarily been able to articulate. One point he hits on, and quite accurately, I might add, is why Americans are such achievers and workaholics and how we tend to cram all of our hours and minutes with activity. Some argue that ""our energy is merely part of some manic drive to avoid the deep and profound issues of life, to skate along the surface of existence and wallow in material luxury and incessant gain."" - that's dead on."
2,Verbiage,"Brooks' overall theme of Americans' optimistic spirit and continual striving is great, if not exactly novel. However, I take umbrage with his utter wordiness and agree with other reviewers who say this seemed like one long essay or article. Brooks' uses quotations excessively and his hyperbolic ""examples"" are irritating. I am especially disappointed with his use of ""blonde bimbo"" in chapter three. I am not blonde, but this offensive metaphor serves only to continue the existence of such stereotypes. This book contained some interesting ideas, but I would say that you can capture all the good points by skimming."
2,Overblown and Pointless,"What exactly is Brooks' point? Book is filled with quotes and references to many other well known authors. Much reference to the worldwide contempt of American's through the eye's of those that feel we work to hard and don't enjoy the cultural aspects of life. So What. A short essay on the subject and an outing at the mall would suffice. Time better spent with George Carlin at the other side of the political spectrum, vastly more entertaining and educational."
2,I never finished this book....,"Don't know why I never finished this book. It's witty, truthful, insightful, and an easy read.The book seems to be just one long witty article that simply goes on for pages. I will finish the book eventually, but there are too many others that seem to grab my attention and pull me away from this one..."
1,entertaining but...,"This book is funny, no doubt about it. I'm giving it one star because I feel that the book's attitude towards people in the ""exurbs"" is condescending and ultimately a bit offensive.People in New York and Washington may find his descriptions of people in the south and midwest amusing, but ultimately, these descriptions are inaccurate and simplistic. Mr. Brooks should stick to lampooning people he knows, the ""Bobos"" as he calls them."
2,Liberalism,"This book pretends to be honest, but really it is an American bashing book in disguise. A few chapters are funny, his sterotypes are true in many cases, but he makes America look as bad as foreigners think it is."
1,"The shining city on the hill, not","Humor hardly seems conguent with the overriding backrop of the unprovoked invasion of Iraq, and clever talk of American exceptionalism is so much prattle. Conjure up fear and we're just as prone to blind obedience as another people who felt the righteous obligation to avenge Poland's treacherous 1939 attacks on its border stations."
4,"Good, But Not as Good as ""Bobos in Paradise""","I really wish I could give 3.5 stars to this book because while it was well-written and well-researched, I had to struggle through it while I laughed my way through ""Bobos in Paradise."" This book is essentially a simplified, modern version of Alexis de Tocqueville's ""Democracy in America,"" but nowhere near as good. I'm a big fan of David Brooks' irreverent, hyperbolic writing style, but I do think he's stretched himself too far and too thin in this book."
3,I wish he had convinced me that Americans aren't crass materialists,"I thoroughly enjoy Brooks's brand of ""comic sociology"" and would give his earlier book on Bobo's 5 stars. In this book, though, Brooks wants to argue that the McMansions and SUV's that hog and clog the American landscape are emblems of a utopian striving essential to our national identity. His sociology, though, is too breezy to actually demonstrate this. He doesn't talk to or observe in close details immigrants or working class americans and his commentary on ubermoms and middle class culture is at it's best when it highlights their vacuity."
3,Not nearly as thorough as Bobos in Paradise,"This seemed to be two books -- one a continuation of Bobos in Paradise, with its wry, slightly exaggerated social commentary, and then an essay that went on and on and on. A bit disappointing."
2,Genesis- The Weekend,"I enjoyed Brooks presentation of this book on TV. In particular, I enjoyed his tale of the suburban men's Saturday activity at Home Depot- drooling over the Weber Genesis Grill- a patio stove named for a book of the Bible. Sure enough, I went to Home Depot for the Saturday morning run, the cleaners, Home Depot, and Costco, and checked out the Genesis Grill. No one making burnt offerings there, however.Brooks is a DC guy, which is a peculiar subset of the East Coast guys. I have been to all of the 'burbs he pokes fun at- Highlands Ranch, CO, et al (nope, don't want to live there. Prefer a university town Northwest of Denver).There are small towns all over the west, which are more complete cities than the one in which he lives.His view of the 'burbs is well written and amusing, but relects shallow thought, like a dumb blonde joke."
5,Excellent Coverage - Easy to use,"I recieved Corel Painter with my Wacom tablet and have had little experience with it. The book was of great use to me. The step by step instructions were easy to follow and the author presented the material in a fun, lighhearted manner which made it fun to read. This book provided me with a lot of tips and tricks that I would never otherwise know."
1,Don't buy this one!,"I have several other flash drives, including some older models of Sandisk Cruzers, which I use on four different XP computers --2 at home and 2 at work. This is the first flash drive I've ever had that gave me problems --whatever security and/or recognition apps/software (??) is on this thing is giving three out of four of my regular PCs a hard time. (Yes, I tried reformatting it -- same problems.) It works on one PC after requiring a reboot to ""recognize"" the new drive every time I plug it in; two other PCs both freeze when I try to access the drive, and one of those invariably crashes Windows as well. Strangely, the fourth PC has no problems with it--one of my work PCs, so I don't really know what the difference might be, altho theoretically that machine should be exactly like the other work PC that freezes and crashes.But I do know that I recommend not buying this particular Cruzer model."
2,Not as good as his other books,"The only reason I picked up this book was because of his other book Effective C++. I liked the way he approached things in that book so I decided to pick up this book as well, trusting that I was going to get the same result. Writing a book on the STL is different however and the formula that worked for Effective C++ didn't work for this one at all. If you're looking for a book specifically on STL then I would recommend picking up something else before this one. If you've already read all the books on STL and you're looking for something that'll put some of those pieces together than this might be the one for you."
3,Unnecessary,"I do not think that the book is needed at all. Most of the rules of thumb explained in the book can be deducted from the asymptotic guarantees of the STL library. And these guarantees can be expected from mature implementations of pretty understood data-structures and algorithms.Therefore, I would recommend any book about algorithms. I like ""The Algorithm Design Manual"" from Skiena. However, I guess that any other will be better than the STL book."
2,"Effective STL, More effective STL, More More Effective STL","What happened to the day when an author possessed the ability to convey an ideal within the confines of one book. It is my opinion that Scott Meyers is only out to sell as many books as possible. The next time Scott Meyers decides to write a book; he definitely needs to spend a little more time so that maybe once in his life he will be able to offer a complete product. I was left with the impression that I had purchased the first few chapters of a good book. I guess I will have to wait around for Scott Meyers to finish what he started. What I mean by this is, Scott, When are you going to write More Effective STL? Are you going to make a trilogy of STL and follow More Effective STL up with More More Effective STL? Also, I am still waiting for More More Effective C++ to hit the shelves at $--.-- a pop. Pass this book up and look for something more complete on the STL."
5,Converted a hard-core C programmer to the STL!,"I thought this book was great. It gave me allot of good ideas and showed me how to things I didn't know how to before. But the real selling point was that I loaned it to a coworker who was a hard-core C programmer. He scoffed at C++ and OOP in general; making statements like ""Everything I need to do can be done in C"". After reading three items in the book he was questioning his thinking and trying new things. His latest project is not only in C++ but it's also embedded in the STL. He's taken quite a liking to it and has learned a lot of new things.While I wouldn't recommend this book for a beginner, anyone that wants to further his or her understanding of the STL should read this book cover to cover."
5,Great (but *definitely* not for beginners),"This is an indispensible book if you are already a very competent C++ programmer but think you might be missing out on some of STL. Do *not* purchase this book to learn STL - that's not what it's for. Buy this book if you've been using STL for a while and are pretty familiar with it. it contains many very specific examples of what to do, and what not to do with STL. You'll be disgusted byu how many of his ""rules"" you were breaking! Unfortunately, you won't understand it before you use STL for a while.To learn STL, I highly recommend ""C++: HOW TO PROGRAM"" by Deitel and Deitel. It might be ugly, but it is the best C++ book out there."
4,Did not realise this was an international seller,"Being international seller it took a good 4 weeks to arrive. Book was as good as new only for a fold mark in the back cover page running vertically down the whole cover. Just started reading. Book does give a good insight for those who want to understand what can go wrong using STL, Can take you from a beginner level to an advanced level, if not expert level."
3,pre-Mastodon,"This is Brent Hinds pre-Mastodon band.......its one trippy cd nothin like the metal of mastodon......this is an odd blend of psychobilly, surf punkCalypsoBlack GrassGreen SlimeCha-ChaBank Robbin' BanditsTsunamiHot RodNew YorkDon't LikeDon't Like IIStupidoGet StraightVolcano"
3,Too expensive for what it offers,"This video reminds me of the typical foreign language audiocassette tapes that one purchases. The video does cover the alphabet very quickly (the video is only 60 minutes). It then covers common words and phrases by showing the english word/phrase, its phonetic spelling, the arabic script and a picture of whatever the word/phrase is (this last thing is the only difference between this video course and an audiocassette course). It did not cover any grammar. It certainly wasn't a bad tool to learn from but I could have done without the pictures and just bought a audiocassette tape that is significantly cheaper (it really wasn't worth the cost of $75) and that has basically the same material. Perhaps had it had some catchy songs or visual aids or something it might have been worth it, but it was literally as I described as above."
5,Great,"It was before time. I liked it i, I have used it as well but I upgraded to the G lens. But I love the metal lens hood"
2,Dull,"I have read many, many books about vampires, so perhaps I am jaded. This book was slow and dull. There is little plot excitement, little character depth and little originality. Parts of the book read well, but other sections read like the worst pulp fiction. It was a short book, so I was able to force myself through the whole thing, but I don't think I would have bothered if it were any longer. If you absolutely love this genre and have run out of everything else to read, you may find it just ok. If you are new to this type of book that start with almost anything else. I'm hard pressed to think of another vampire as hero/with romance book published in the last ten years that is worse."
1,What a disappointment,"I bought this book because it was recommended by Amazon.com for those who enjoyed Laurell K. Hamilton. What a waste of money! The characters are developed, but they aren't interesting. The plot is weak. Is it a romance? Is it a mystery? Is it horror? I find it hard to believe that after a few brief questions and one date that Mitch and Diedra fall madly in love. The relationship isn't developed just as no other plot thread is truly developed. I finally stopped reading page by page around page 60 and just skimmed the rest. I found it highly disappointing."
2,OK potboiler,"Thrill to the adventures of Deirdre the Vampire dress designer as she gives her victims the occasional love bite. Ooooh the horror !! Make no mistake this isn't Anne Rice, but it's an OK way to kill a few hours if it's raining and you have nothing else to read."
1,complete waste of money,"I once was foolish enough to try one of these relatively small and fragile shovels by Hoppy. I soon found out, unfortunately, that not only is the thing made of the very cheapest of cheap plastic, it can break easily and it doesn't shovel much snow well.In fact, it can lift so little snow that with any real snowfall it's useless. You'll be shoveling out forever and a day!If you want to give a small child a snow shovel to play with while you do the real work of shoveling out, then get this. Otherwise, for people who drive cars and people wanting to shovel snow will be very disappointed.Don't waste your money!"
2,Not durable,Ours snapped right at the telescoping part in the middle of the shovel. Shoddy construction; I'd recommend getting something made out of metal.
2,Highly.........unrecommended.,"I usually give 3 stars for something less satisfactory that I don't recommend for people to buy. This product is worse than that. I saw this just at the entrance of a well-known grocery store. I thought it really looks nice and a clever tool.There is a foam to place your hand in the middle which provides a nice comfortable grip. The telescoping part just extends a few inches, it should be longer so you don't have to stoop too much. But the main problem is it breaks too easily. It detaches it the middle where it extends. Once it detaches, you cannot use it anymore. Not even super glue can fix it. This thing is also too light that it feels more like a beach toy. I hate to call a product a POC, but this one fits the boot."
1,"Cheap, Fragile Handle, Poor Emergency Shovel","I bought this to place in the trunk of my car in case of an emergency. I thought I'd made a good puchase until I had to use the shovel. The telescopic handle would not lock in place, causing the shovel to rotate, rendering it virtually useless. I don't know if this is common to all these Hopkins Shovels, but I will not buy another. Mine went in the garbage. Do not recommend whatsoever as it may fail you as it did me.konedog"
1,Broke the first use,"I was willing to spend the money because a regular-sized shovel wouldn't fit in the car. But we had a heavy wet snow, about 6 inches. While helping a friend dig out in a parking lot, the locking mechanism on the handle broke,the first time we used it. Not worth the money..."
1,NOT FOR EMERGENCIES!!!,Broke at the telescoping joint during light use. I'm glad I wasn't using it to dig my car out!
1,Poor construction.,"The first time I used it, I had the shovel fully extended. After several digs into the snow, the shovel suddenly collapsed into self. The construction is extremely fragile and not worth the money."
3,Splurge and buy a better shovel,"OK, It hasn't snowed here, yet. I haven't actually used it for its intended purpose. That being said, I can already tell it won't be real efficient for real snow removal. I think it looks like a big kids sandbox shovel. The telescoping handle isn't long enough to allow the adult user to straighten up. I am glad I only wasted about $9 on this. I will look for a more substantial shovel."
4,Right for the car,"It was just like the pitcure. The only problem that I have with it that the handle does not extend that far, so it is as small as the pitcure makes it.If it would come out some me I would give it 5 stars, but just because I did not give it that you should not think down on this itemBUY BUY BUY"
1,can't judge yet,"HAS NOT YET ARRIVED!!! we were told it would come AFTER Christmas, but not arrived yet."
1,Get an aluminum shovel,If you want a durable shovel for your car this is not the answer. For me the bracket that holds the blade to the handle broke soon after purchase and caused the blade to be unstable. I jerry-rigged it with some duct tape and now just a few days ago I was stuck on an icy patch and needed to dig out a spot to gain traction and the shovel broke in half and crumbled in my hands. You can believe that after paying a tow truck that I was cursing myself for not spending $50 on a good aluminum shovel. Don't make the same mistake!!
1,Should be arrested!!,"This item is a complete piece of crap in my opinion. About 2 minutes after I started using this peice of garbage, and it was not heavy packed snow, it broke at the point where it extends. The makers of this garbage should be ashamed of themselves and investigated by the BBB!!"
3,okay but not great,"this is an emergency shovel and can not be used for heavy snow or ice.it is cheap and plastic. just for situtatons when you need to use withyour car. it is small and light. if you apply too much pressure, it will break."
1,Disposable Showel,I bought this for my car just in case I get stuck in snow.Broke after less than 5 times of usage.
3,Not durable but easily fixable,"The joint for telescoping the handle broke after about 10 minutes the first time I used it. The interior part of the joint cracked and the glue came loose. I fixed it with Gorilla glue and now it works fine. I like the high edges on the scoop, they really help pick up the snow that just slides off the ends of a flatter blade."
5,Easy to understand reference book.,"I attended a Fiber Optic class taught by Mr. Pearson and found him to be an excellent instructor. This book is written the same way he teaches and is easy to understand. Since I don't build fiber cables on a daily basis I keep this book in front of me when I do build them. If you have never been taught to build fiber cables you can learn how from this book. However, you should note that building good fiber cables takes practice no matter how you learned to build them. Read this book carefully and you can do it."
2,Power is in the Details,"This book started of great. I learned quite a bit about CSS from Eric Meyer's books so when I saw he wrote the foreword, it showed promise. That dwindled after the many typo's that were riddled throughout the book. I have a totally marked up copy of this book due to careless editing.Editing this type of book is CRUCIAL since CSS is such a detail oriented process. When you forget to add a number or a semicolon, it simply will not work. This was the case time and time again.Also, the accompanying Web site's downloads varied from what was presented in the book so even if you did as instructed to do, it will not match what was available on the Web site. The Web site files were consistently correct and should have mirrored what was written in the book, but this was NOT the case.Overall, the book presents great information on CSS in a clear fashion, BUT it looses all credibility since the editorial staff failed to do their job."
3,Good concept,"I very much like the concept of teaching with examples and this book does that well. I think this is an excellent book for those who are new to css and html. It is too shallow for people at an intermediate level of either of those skills.If the author's intent was a beginners-only level book, then I should rate this as a 5-star product. If it was intended to bring the reader to an intermediate level, then my rating is correct.Good work, but it left me hungry before I got halfway through."
5,Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) By Example,"Do you want a book which teaches you CSS by examples and also have an author who is willing to help you with questions? Then, BE SURE to purchase this book. I purchased it only a few days after its publication and am very pleased with it. There are example files which you download from the book's website (This eliminates alot of unnecessary typing). A concept is explained and then you are given an example to type in the style sheet and then check in your browser to see what the affect is. This makes it very easy to understand and see the results. In addition, there are 3 appendix which give further valuable information. One in particular lists all the CSS1 properties and descriptions. If you are really interested in learning CSS, purchase THIS book."
5,A fine book for beginners to CSS,"After 3 weeks of learning HTML (with Sam's Teach Yourself Web Publishing with HTML and XHTML in 21 Days by Laura Lemay) I bought Cascading Style Sheets for Dummies. It was DREADFUL. Undetered, I went out and bought this book.Within days I was comfortable and happy with CSS. The real-world examples in the book and the clear way in which it has been laid out make it very easy to follow. Prior knowledge of HTML is going to be a big help, but HTML listings are provided for everything.Steve Callihan has created the ultimate beginners guide to CSS here."
4,Good starter book but...,"Great book until halfway through. I found the black and white graphics a bit hard on the eye when the actual work was so colorful. Perhaps better coding examples would have helped?Also noticed the files on the authors website did not always match the files in the book. this caused me to put down the book in frustration at least once.I do recommend this book for beginners though. The author will hold your hand and walk you through the examples as you learn.Great beginning companion/stepping stone to ""Eric Meyer on CSS: Mastering the Language of Web Design""Between the two books you should be ready to go."
3,Good beginner's book,"This book is extremely simplistic in its examples. It does provide a good base knowledge of how CSS should be implemented and some good examples of functions. That bieng said it does not address browser compatability much at all, it favors Internet Explorer (which is great) but as a result several of the examples which are hybrid CSS versions fail in a Mozilla browser.If you're looking for something to understand CSS and what it is: this book is great. As a technical reference it is not that useful."
4,brilliant cultural reggae with beautiful harmonies.,"this 1978 release from culture brings several brilliant tracks: ""behold i come quickly"", ""so long"" (also recorded by count ossie), and ""how can i leave JAH"" are the three gems of the bunch. culture is here with the uncompromising rasta message brought in soulful harmony that is their trademark. the title track, ""baldhead bridge"" is probably the weakest cut; still, rasta and reggae-lover alike will enjoy this album."
4,Cultist Rejoice over quinessential Yakuza movie book!!!,"The book is a cultist dream and the info's on the genre is just terrific.However,I was dismayed that there was no review of the mind-blowing ""Branded to Kill""by Seijun Suzuki.It's a film that challenged the conventional(thus having unfortunate circumstances for director's Suzuki's career)and haunting film-noir at it's best.I'm also disapointed that there was no interview from my personal favorite actor,Takekura Ken who embodies the genre at it's finest.But aside from this minor oversights,the book is a fast read and detailed at the same time.I am amazed on the author's knowledge of the genre and it was written with both affection and fascination on the subject.A dream book for cultist like me and one that will be read and browsed for many years to come.""Domo arigato,Mark-san""."
3,Asking the Right Questions,"This book is a good text book for college students but not for the general public. I wanted something that I could use as quick reference to help my young son learn how to analyze things quickly. This book goes into depth on how to disect a question, pose a question, and much more, etc. Very good for an academic setting. Ordinary people who have already left college do not have time to read a book as detailed and involved as this one is -- which is why I said it is not for the general public. Of course, this is just my opinion. It would be great for students. Not a quick read."
4,Great Product,Cisco products have always done well for me. This one was not a disappointment. The network is just as reliable as it was before.
5,Big and Masculine,"This watch is BIG and not for the timid. Couldn't pass up the great buy, additional 20% discount, and free shipping. That makes the 6th Invicta I have and not a complaint on any of them."
2,Meh.,"Its ok. Never kept very good time. Average watch that lasted me a little over a year (just outside of warranty) then just stopped winding right and stopped running for more than a couple hours. Just FYI, you can hand wind it too."
5,Another great Invicta product.,"I started collecting Invicta watches a couple of years ago. This Ocean Ghost is my fourth and is a great addition to my collection. Definitely an event watch (night out, meeting with clients you want to impress, etc). My Invictas are all great watches and are an amazing value, feeling, working, and looking like they should cost much, much more."
4,"A tasteful, warm guitar/organ trio","Vic Juris' tasty, agile, imaginative guitar lines will appeal to fans of Jim Hall and John Abercrombie, and this album finds him in a warm and swinging setting with organist Jesse Chandler and drummer Tim Horner. It's not groundbreaking music, but it's damn appealing, fluid, and subtle, with a fresh selection of covers including the title track, Hall's should-be-classic ""Careful,"" and Wes Montgomery's ""Road Song.""Montgomery's superb trios with Mel Rhyne provide the presiding spirit for these sessions, but Chandler is a highly unusual player whose tone-colors are brighter than the usual jazz B-3 fare. Recommended."
2,Not What I Wanted - Title Confusion,"Do not confuse this with While My Guitar Gently Weeps V.2 or While My Guitar Gently Weeps V.3, which are European compendiums of various artists & their guitar music. Amazon does not list the While My Guitar Gently Weeps V.1 as available, So I am out (...). READ THE FINE PRINT ALWAYS.... and you will not be ripped as I was. Amazon has a way of begging out. This offer borders on Fraud.I found the music to be bland and poorly mixed. And I like Jazz and I am Danish."
2,Garage finishing catalog with editorial.,"This book is pretty much a catolog of various garage finishing resources. Some additional information is given, but you'll get just as much out of this book as a free Griot's Garage catalog. The text in this book was fairly unbiased, though."
1,Worthless,"This book was definitely not worth the money, which is why we returned it. Instead of helpful ideas it was one big advertisement for different products. Unfortunately, since we actually looked at the book, we lost half of our refund due to a refund processing fee. Don't make the same mistake we did!"
5,The de facto resource for any garage organization project!,"This is simply the best first step you can take before you tackle that garage. Whether you're an experienced pro or a do-it-yourselfer looking for great ideas, West provides reviews for all kinds of organization products.What I really liked about this book was that it helped me personalize my garage. It's an attached 3 car garage, facing the street. I like to keep the door open in the warmer months, and I spend a good deal of time working in the garage. I needed to park my cars, motorcycle and various lawn care machines safely and still accommodate my hobbies (restoring old woodworking machinery, metal working and wood working). The product information and excellent photos gave me some great ideas on how I could make my garage/workshop functional, while satisfying my wife's desire to have a great looking entry to our home.If you have a garage that's in need of professional help, get this book!"
2,More of a catalog...,"The book has some pretty pictures but not a ton of substance. A lot of product reviews in here and advertising for various companies and services but not a lot about actual organizational ideas. If you want to treat this as more of a catalog to see what kind of organizational products are out there then great, I recommend. But otherwise I found the plans and ideas not practical for the everyday user, especially one with a budget. Therefore only 2 stars for the title which I found misleading: ""Innovative Ideas for the Garage"" .... really should say ""Innovative Products for the Garage"""
1,INFOMERCIAL as a a book,This book is just an infomercial without the TV! It doesn't help you organize or give you ideas it just tries to sell you organization systems! You might as well just drive to Home Depot or Lowes and save the money on this book!!
1,Not worth the price - any price,"My garage is a mess, and I was hoping this book would give me ideas for getting it organized. It gets off to a great start, but that's as far as it goes. For example, it says that when the garage is a mess, you cannot find things and have to go out and buy replacements - all too true. It also says that you must throw things away - of course.The problem is, when it comes to making the garage nicer, it refers the reader to sources for expensive storage cabinets and floor coverings. I do not want to spend $10,000 re-doing my garage, nor do I want to install thousands of dollars worth of cabinets.The ""ideas"" presented in this book consist mainly of lists of expensive suppliers. I would have preferred plans and ideas for do-it-yourself storage and shelving."
1,Need a catalog?,"This so called ""book"" on garage organization is little more than a catalog of garage organizing products. The authors ""commentary"" reads like ad copy for the manufacturers. Little original thinking. A few anecdotes sprinkled in amongst the ""advertisments"". The author states he has not been compensated for featuring any products in the ""book"", but he should have been. I feel as though I completely wasted my money."
3,Nice toy but didn't take much interest of my 14 month dauther,"My baby seems to be entertined at times, but from the first few weeks the interest already wore off. I personally like it, its fun, has many songs and animal sounds, so I do encourage her to play with it and she does if she feels like it."
2,boring characters,"One of the negative reviews complained about this novel's wordiness. It was wordy at times, but I could live with that because Wagner can be so witty and has such a facility with word play. What made me dislike this novel is that while the characters lead interesting lives, at least the children do, they are not just unsympathetic, they are boring."
1,Too much,"I found this book annoyingly, excessively wordy. It read as if the author wrote it while as stoned (or whacked out on Red Bull)as one of his characters and spent way too much time googling references. There were so many television references that will be obsolete in about 2 more years and in 10 will make no sense at all to anyone. I can't believe Ryan Seacrest didn't make a cameo (spoiler alert, the Dog Whisperer has a role). And every urban myth that comes out of incredably minor characters mouths, ahhhhhhhh. Talk about a short shelf life. If this is suposed to represent the LA essence it is amazingly superficial so in that respect it works."
5,The best book ever,"This book takes you along the process of learning regression analysis easily. The author takes the time to show you how to solve real problems, the disc that comes with the book allows to even go deeper on the subject of study. The one who buys this book will never sell it, you'll need it all your professional life."
1,Not Even close.....,"Nigel Kennedy is deemed by many people to be a talented violinist. He is technically brilliant but has not got the important feeling for music to make him a good virtuoso. He certainly misunderstood Elgar. The elgar pieces played on this CD is pieces with a lot of feeling, which Nigel Kennedy completely ignored and turned the whole performance into a violin-bashing exercise. Different violinists have different talents for different composers. Kennedy should leave Elgar, and for that matter Bach alone. He just does not connect with these composers at all. There is more to playing classical music than tecnique."
4,TINY TINY TINY!,"These are so small it would take a lifetime to make any substantial amount of cookies to share with anyone. I wasn't pleased but they do work fine. Just too small for what would hope for. I think they're for icing, not cookies, though, so they're probably not supposed to be as big as I wanted...."
2,Unable to withstand water damage,For a 110 dollar scale this product is not made to last. The features are defiantly not worth what the price is. The body fat monitor does not accurately measure body fat %. When the product broke the company refused to cover it for warranty. There are scale with the same features for at least half the price.
4,"Good product, great performance",Good product! We use it on a professional setting and it works perfectly! Specifically chosen by features and size. Recoomended to us by a personal trainer.
4,"Not perfect, but GREAT VALUE!!","I've wanted a Tanita scales for a long time. I finally sabatoged my old scales so I'd have a good excuse to buy this one.The Tanita gives fairly consistant results. Body Fat Percentage will vary from 10-15%, but other readings are very consistant. I'm very happy with the Tanita BC-548. I feel it is a very good value.Also: It looks sooooooooooooo cool."
5,GET THIS BOOK!,"This is a great book! So far I have made five recipes from this book and I love them all! The Buttery-Pull-Apart Rolls are simply amazing! They are the most tender, soft and fluffiest rolls I've made! The Scones are buttery and delicious, so good with a glass of milk! I like it that the measurements comes in weight and cup measurements, I'm a user of both measurements, so I find it extremely helpful. This is a GREAT BOOK! Highly recommended!"
2,Childs Necklace,This Necklace is very small. The necklace looks like a necklace for a small child not an adult. While it is pretty it is just not made for an adult. The box it comes in is plastic inside like cheap costume jewelry. If a young child bought this for there mother I'm sure the mother would love it. But adults this is just not a gift you would feel proud giving.
4,Something Different,"Having read both of Alison Wier's recent forays into historical fiction, which were very enjoyable, I decided to take a chance and try one of her works from her historical genre. It is very well done, but I guess my tastes are more in the historical fiction area. It's a little tough to get through for me, since it is factual and lacks the romance and spark of a work of fiction. She does a great job at both, though, so if you like historical accounts of this era, you will enjoy this book."
2,Utterly Disappointing.,"I approached this book with great anticipation as it seemed to have all the necessary prerequisites for a great biography: superbly interesting characters and times, and an intimate, personal feel. It was ultimately frustrating as Weir becomes consumed with petty details, such as exhausting accounts of all of Henry's real estate transactions year by year, and the price paid for each. This is accompanied by mundane and repetitive descriptions of the art, architecture and furnishings of each one. There are only so many times a person can read about cloth of gold and diamond broaches before one just doesn't give a damn anymore.Weir devotes little if any time to the politics and events of the day in favor for minute and tiring descriptions. The book had the feel of a high school term paper in that it was haphazard and barely coherent. I would highly recommend this book to an expert in Tudor era art and architecture, but to the general reader STAY AWAY!"
2,It Goes On For Days,"I am a big Alison Weir fan, but this book is probably the most boring, and confusing I have ever read. In fact, Its hard to even pick it up. She has VERY meticulously researched King Henry's Court, and the Time Period , but it all seems to run in together. I would read this book for the well documented research, but I would check it out at your local Library, or through a friend."
2,"Too much detail, not enough interest","Most of the author Alison Weir's books set out to tell a story, and are riveting reads which take you easily through history. They are page turners, even though you know what is going to happen in the end. However Henry and his court is page after page and chapter after chapter of detail, with very little narrative thread. Turgid and dull."
3,Usual HVIII Retread,"Have read 25+ books on the life of Henry and had high hopes for this book. This should be treated as a general primer on his life and nothing more. Lots of facts and details but offers little in providing understanding of how Henry's belief system shaped everything he did. Important subjects and milestones in his life are washed over. Henry Tudor was an incredibly complex man that believed in a hierarchial relationship that provided for contracts between God and King, King and lesser royalty, lesser royalty and landowners, landowners and mean men. It's absolutley critical to understand these relationships, in context with his religious beliefs, to gain an understanding of the king. Weir provides little explanation of these relationships and the events she describes. IMHO, the best book ever written on him is by Lacey Baldwin Smith, behind the mask of royalty. If you can find it, this book will provide you an incredibly deep view of the escense on Henry"
5,Enthralling,"I read this book a few years back, and it still stands as a prize of my collection. I drank this book in with all the thirst a 'Tudor-fanatic' could muster. I was especially drawn into the extensive details of life at court. Not the clean, neat places one would believe from fairy tales. The reeking, dirty, chaotic messes were described in detail, and a dissection of banking logs give you a mouthwatering taste of actual events and tastes of the period. My goodness.The only drawback to feasting on this, is that it gives such a real picture and deeper understanding of Henry and those around him, that now I am highly critical of the fiction works I still read on the era. I am quick to be frustrated by discrepancies and portrayals of characters by other authors.I am a huge Weir fan and HIGHLY recommend this book!"
3,Recommended reading,"It was a good read. Very detailed about Henry's life and less focus on the politics of the tudor court. Weir goes into lots of details about the architech of the various palaces if you wanted to know about them. For me I was more interested in details about his various family members like his wives whom had short reigns Jane Seymour, Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard, his sisters Margaret Tudor and Mary Tudor and niece Frances Brandon. It's a shame though there wasn't more information on the other various royal family members. Though there is quite some detail on his advisors and other courtiers like Brandon duke of Suffolk, crammer and cromwell. Like many others have mentioned the first third of the book is slow but it will catch on after that. Still I would recommend this one."
3,Interesting but too long,"This book speaks about the life at court during the reign of Henry VIII. It isn't bad. It contains some interesting facts, but also has lots of info we already know from other books. It is not the best from Alison Weir, but it can be read, especially if you are a fanatic of the topic like me"
4,Good historical read.,"This is a well researched and highly documented look at the court intrigues surrounding Henry VIII's court and the King himself. It begins with his ascension and moves forward through is reign which changed the course of European history.That having been said, the version I got from my local library was the first edition of the hardback and the editing on it was horrible. There were multiple misspellings. (And I'm not confusing US spelling with English spelling.) I don't know if they were pushing to get this out because of the demand for the Tudor information in 2001-2002 after Gregory's books became bestsellers."
3,A biography that lacks political understanding,"As the published reviews have said, this book is what it is: A detailed (even exhaustive) narrative of life at the court of Henry VIII, but it leaves the reader wondering. Weir makes sense of Henry's successive marriages, and gives great detail into the social behavior of the time. She achieves some depth in discussing religion--Henry broke with Rome, but wasn't really much of a Protestant, it turns out. While the internal power struggles of the courtiers are interestingly narrated, the overall political picture remains a mystery. Henry invades France, Henry makes peace with France, he goes to war again--why? In sum, a rollicking beach book, but not for serious study."
3,Ms. Weir's Research Outakes!,"This book, while enjoyable, is for the more serious student of the Tudor time period. Overloaded with lists of Henry's purchases and possesions, it often has little narrative flow.It's hard to imagine this book came from the same pen as Elizabeth I and Elenore of Aquitane. The only Weir I won't be keeping a copy of."
3,Not a Weir best,"I have read Alison Weir's books on the Tudor period: Six Wives, Children of Henry VIII, and Life of Elizabeth I. I found her a very enjoyable writer, and felt involved in her subjects as people, not just as historical figures. In this book, however, I felt distant from Henry VIII, even though descriptions and anecdotes abounded through the pages. Perhaps that was part of the problem--it felt like his person was being justified, rather than developed as the book progressed. Also, a more fitting title would have been ""Life in and around King Henry VIII's Court."" The in-depth instruction of architecture, interior decoration, politicking, and background nature took some attention away from the king in question. I enjoyed the period review, but the pace did plod along more than her other books that I've read."
3,Didn't Hold My Interest,"While crammed with details regarding every aspect of court life, the story behind the possesions and personalities gets shortchanged in this ambitious yet flawed book.Yes, I learned quite a bit but for much of the book I was struggling to maintain interest as the myriad details bogged down the narrative.Alison Weir is generally a wonderful popular historian of the period but I think this book needed more focus to retain appeal for the general reader."
5,brings the background into focus,"A book like this about the court of Henry 8th is long overdue. Instead of concentrating soley on Henry this book attempts to fill out the background of the court he lived in and the people he interacted with an a daily basis.You get things like an explanation of the various court titles and functions and how they changed over the course of his reign. There are also sections on costume and painting and the interactions of the various noble families (and not so noble) during Henry's lifetime.This is a 'widescreen' biography, not a narrow view. It's full of interesting, small details of daily life that are missed in the larger political biographies.This book was a welcome and refreshing take on Tudor history. Reccomended if you want to fill in the background details of Henry's court."
4,Very informative.,"I bought this book because I wanted to learn more about King Henry VIII, and I got to learn all about him."
4,Wow!!,"This is Elkie Brooks at her best. The tracks on this C.D. are GREAT. Elkie own compositions stand up to the other artist on this C.D. such as Bob Dylan.Her vocal ability really shines on this album, a must for music fans everywhere."
4,"Good content, overproduced format","The content of this book is great, especially given that the majority of this collection is no longer in the US. The book format, however, is overproduced. Some illustrations are on full page slick paper, while others are tipped in on bond paper. All the text is on bond. The cover is cloth, with title and decorations in a silver colored metal (applied as a powder). The book, purchased from a vendor through Amazon, was listed as new, although the fragile cover had some damage, particularly metal flaking off, and the edge of the pages (also silver colored metal) showed ware. Some of the tipped in illustrations had lost contact points, although none were completely loose. Fortunatly, most art book publishers avoid this level overproduction, leading to such fragility. Again, the content is quite useful and informative."
5,My 5 year-old is Tooth Crazy!,"My son has seen all the Timmy the Tooth videos except 2 and he says this one is the best. Timmy and the gang are cowboys in the Old West in this adventure. They meet Goonie the Kid who spells everything wrong, and have to get Timmy's library card back. Full of bad puns and silly fun, I bet your kids will go Tooth Crazy, too."
5,Spellbinding,"Indie authors should study this thriller to get pointers on how to 1) hatch a plot 2) build believable characters and more importantly, 3) how to hook the reader from page 1 and not let go till the last page."
2,Don't accept it as well-represented fact.,"This is a very persuasive book in which Mr. Nader is trying to get you to take every single aircooled Volkswagen off of the road forever. There are solid facts about old Volkswagen's safety shortcomings. However, some of these appear to be missing exact facts(which worked in favor of Mr. Nader) The handling characteristics seem a bit exaggerated to me. I love how he goes on and on for pages about a defective gas cap. I think it is worthwhile for an aircooled Volkswagen owner to read this. I would advise, however, to take it with a grain of salt. As I think it is one-sided in many places and maybe some factors are not explained.Plus how can a man hate cars so much yet never have been behind the wheel of one? :)"
2,Review from a grad student not at Wharton,Reading Steele's book without attending has classes at Wharton leaves the reader looking for explanations to equations. Ideas are not clearly explained and problems are not worked out in detail with a descriptive process of how to solve the problem. The brief explanations in this book intended for a reader with knowledge of calculus and probability but not having a background in Stochastic calculus do not provide a sufficient basis for the reader to learn the material.
1,deceived by the publisher,"I felt extremely disappointed to look into this book the minute I received it. I usually love all springer books specially for their top quality presentation. This book is an exception. You pay nearly [...] bucks for a book to get a fac-simile of the original with less margin space, larger fonts, and less line-to-line space making it overly populated of characters and ugly to the eye. Not even Dover books are like this, despite their lower prices.I am definitely contacting springer on this and I am seriously thinking of returning the book to amazon and getting a used one with better presentation quality."
2,I Hate It When Books Lie About Mathematical Requriements,"The book says that its only prerequisites are calculus and probability. This is not true. To be able to understand everything that's going on, you'll need to have a very good grasp of subjects like measure-theoretic probability, Hilbert spaces, and functional analysis. I quit reading the book in the early chapters, when Steele starts talking about things like ""spans"" and ""denseness"" for function spaces. I don't know where you went to school, but at my school, I didn't learn these subjects in my intro calculus and probability classes. To summarize, don't buy this book if you don't know measure theory.If you want to learn quant finance at an elementary level, Baxter and Rennie is much, much better. Moreover, if you're comfortable with measure theory,and you want to learn the math that's necessary for option pricing, you'd be better off buying Oksendal's excellent book, which is at least as rigorous as Steele's book but much more clear."
2,"Too mathematically involved, low in applicability","Sorry to disagree with my esteemed ""colleagues"", but this book is not the best choice if you are (aspiring) financial market professional. The author is clearly in love with his subject (cf., p. 61: ""One could spend a lifetime exploring the delicate - and fascinating - properties of the paths of Brownian motion. Most of us cannot afford such an investment, so hard choices must be made."" Hard indeed!). If you are not a mathematician, a book by Klebaner (""Introduction to Stochastic Calculus with Applications"") can teach you everything you need to know about stochastic calculus."
4,Good Introduction To A Difficult Subject,"The goal of this book is to disseminate the knowledge of a very technical subject to a very wide range of audience, including finance professionals. The author did a respectable job in that regard. With some improvement in future revisions, this book seems to be one of the best introductionary texts on stochastic calculus."
3,Kind of cool yet disappointing,"The setting was screwed up. The story concept was cool but botched as they tried to insert plot into WWII with Japan being on the side of the allies. This is one of those shows that had someone with a little brains in the front office of the studio could have made the series ultra cool and expandable. As it is, Strike Witches is ok but not great."
4,watch with a open mind,Strike witches is one of the better amines I've seen. There is a good story line if you actually watch for it and the animation is great. Now it can get hard to see anything past the nudity of the girls but you have to understand that this is from Japan and there culture is different than ours.The voice over is pretty good but like all cartoons/anime the mouth does not move with the words correctly. it could have been better if aniplex did the production instead of funimation due to the fact that the unnatural beams of light wouldn't annoy people and they can stop complaining about it.Watch this on netflix first and save your self some time and money $8 is still cheaper than the asking price and if you like it you can order it like I did
1,Not good.,"Quite possibly the stupidest anime show I've ever attempted to watch. Girls flying around in their underwear shooting aliens. It's like porn, but without the actual porn. I honestly don't see how anyone could enjoy this."
5,Super anime fun and look mom no pants,This is anime ats its best pure escape into a crazy fun world like no other. We want to buy season 2 next.
4,Srtike Witches,"I bought this anime on a whim and found it highly enjoyable. I was surprised to find it rated TV MA but this did not detract from the enjoyability of the series. The series keeps anything questionable to a minimum and although it may have a few questionable parts, it never felt like it was perverted.The first two episodes are a little slow but after the third episode the series really picks up. The ending had a different feel, the story looses its lightness and gains a more action feel, then the rest of the series but helped tie the whole series together. I would recommend this series to any mature anime fan."
5,Interspirituality is vital for the planet's future,"If you found Tolle's A New Earth Awakening to Your Life's Purpose or Carolyn Myss's Entering the Castle, then you will find this book very enlightening as well. It is a very easy, pleasant read, but very profound."
4,Above average comparative analysis,"It was a pleasure to add this book to my library of original religious texts, cultural history books, philosophical writings, and various psychological and socialogical human and animal behavior studies. Quite interesting. But make no mistake, this is clearly a PRO-RELIGION book and as such, is not capable of moving you past a certain point spiritually. At the end of the day, if the goal is to know truth, all religions, with their illusions, colorful gods, dogmas, mantras, rituals, and their underlying egoistic concepts need to be set aside.This is a book on religion, NOT a book on spirituality. The two words on NOT interchangeable. Worth reading though!"
3,A Fine Recording,"This is definitely a fine recording and perhaps the only one of its kind since I haven't seen other collections of Purcell's overtures. These very worthy works are played very well and elegantly by the Bournemouth Sinfonietta. However, the recording dates from 1980 so you will get a recording from that period which means that there is elegant playing but without much of the energy and creativity that is prevalent in today's interpretations of early music. I would opt for the Academy of Ancient Music's recordings of Purcell's instrumental music, but this comes in a multi-set release and includes other music apart from the overtures. So if you are into the elegant but somewhat slow sound of the Bournemouth Sinfonietta, then this cd is for you."
2,not for a rental,"I got this shower rod in a very timely manner, delivered in a very large box but unfortunately I didn't read the description well enough. I just moved into a house that I am only renting and the setup required screws (into the tile) and plastic anchor deals. My landlord would have a fit if I put holes into her tile so I cannot use the product. If I owned the place I would put it up and I am sure it would be a great space addition. Oh well, my bad."
2,does not work even for office job,"I don't sweat a lot. I work an office job, but I would not trust this product. It is with natural ingredients, but I have no confidence as I would have with some major brands. Male 30yrs old."
1,Stinks,"I bought this Crystal roll-on to switch to something more natural and avoid the dark underarms caused by deodorants containing aluminum. Unfortunately, this does nothing to deodorize me. I used Degree for a long time, and I got all day protection from it. I could even apply it after a run and I'd smell fine until I can get home to shower. With this deodorant, I find myself smelling unpleasant in a few hours, even on a low activity day (e.g. working at a desk job). Might as well spray my pits with water."
1,"Sucks, you will stink!!","I was really excited with the reviews. Bought it and put on a lot, and 4 hours later, I smelled terrible. Although it is not an antiperspirant, at least I thought, it would cut any BO. Nope! I smelled horrible. Don't waste your money trying it!!!"
3,"Pretty good, not great.","The price is comparable to brand name whole wheat pasta available to me locally so I have no complaint regarding that. The texture of this particular brand however is moderately good. Some whole wheat pastas use a higher grade of wheat making it lighter in color and slightly more tender ( Bionaturae and De Cecco pastas comes to mind) . This pasta is darker in color and has a slightly grittier texture then those brands however it is still better then the bargain basement brands found for less. I found cooking it for slightly longer then the instructions call for and in a LOT of water helps to make it smoother. I would use a heavy, more robust sause for this pasta but otherwise we weren't really disappointed."
1,Too bad he sold out,"The Dennis Miller of old was a rarity - a performer that had no agenda and no stated political party, rather he was a good independant comic that would take pot-shots at both sides of the political spectrum when they deserved it. After 9/11 he saw the liberal-bashing bandwagon take off and decided that it was a good way to lift his career out of the quagmire it had become. The problem is that his new target audience is generally undereducated and incapable of understanding his love of obscure references... so his career stays stuck in the same place it was, touring casinos. Within the next few years, expect him to take the next step down in career hell and start performing the county fair circuit."
3,My Review of the Chipette Diares,"These eepisodes have been released on DVD before. They should do a DVD containing the following Chipette episodes: The Chipettes Story, Help wanted Mommy, My Pharaoh Lady, Just One of the Girls, Goin Down to Dixi, Quarterback in Curlers, Queen of the High school Ballroom, Hearts and Flowers, The Legend of the Sleeping Brittany and The Princess and The Pig."
3,sounds like a handful of repeats,I love the old cartoon & at th risk of being hated hated live action movie 1 & 2 because it really had very little to do with the classic cartoon. While I love the running for School president episode It's been done on DVD just a few years ago. Why not the episode of the Chippettes oragin or better yet how Miss miller became their foster mom (with them almost getting split up into 3 foster families. a real heart wrencher something that illistrates their bond of sisterhood. Or that parody of moonlighting that was funny. There is a wide variaty of great episodes yet to be brought out why so many warmed over leftovers?
1,Terrible download,"I have bought dozens of music downloads from Amazon.com. This is the first one that I wish I had not bought. Terrible download. The transitions from one variation to another in the Metamorphosen are not smooth and there are dropouts in at least three movements of that work, especially right after a change from one movement to the next. I would advise being very cautious when purchasing this one. Suggestion: Have the Metamorphosen available for purchase as ONE item, not 12 or 13."
5,Love them!,"I love that I can buy the Pampes Easy Ups in the 4t-5t in bulk. They don't have them in 54 count anywhere else, I have looked in Wal*Mart, and Sams and no one sells them like this. It really does cut down on cost. The only thing that stinks is that the are currently unavailable so I have had to go to the stores to buy them. Hope they come back soon!"
4,Good boots,"Nice boots. They are warm and wear well. The only con was that the leather was not uniform on both pair. One was grainer than the other. If you spit shine your boots, one will require much more polish than the other in order to get a uniform appearance."
1,Worn out soles after 3 months,"These boots offer no ankle support,I wear custom inserts because of fallen arches. The heals of my other boots never wear off to the side like these did. The soft rubber soles are worn out after 3 months of very little use. My feet sweat with regular crew socks while outdoors in 10F weather for only 30 minutes. The leather uppers tear very easy and the quality of leather is not good. I did contact Wolverine and they said they would replace them, however I know I have gotten much better boots for less money and another 3 months of winter use isn't even close to what I expected."
1,wrong item-again,"This is the second pair of wolverine boots ordered through Amazon that ended up not being what was advertised/displayed on the site that I thought I was buying. First order was a pair of wolverine loggers with safety toe that was not supposed to be insulated (ordered during summertime). The ones that were shipped to me were insulated-not gonna work during the summer heat.And this pair, at the time I looked them up on Amazon and then ordered them was advertised as a ""saftey toe"" boot. Now they are being advertised as a ""sport"" boot. The boots that were shipped to me were not safety toe boots-they were soft toe. Completely disappointing-how hard is it to get a product description correct?"
5,A Beautiful Product,"As I was waiting for this glitter was wondering what it was like as I have been trying to use the fine size glitter. The ad itself doesn't give much detail, I find the fine doesn't stick that well or show up well. To my surprise it was good size and sparkles like diamonds too as I was making hand crafted Christmas cards. There is some thing else great about these too. As you take the tape off that holds the top closed, you do have to open very carefully, but the plus is if you are working on a table as you shake off the excess, you can take the main opening of the top off and brush the excess glitter back into the jar. This is a product I love and makes my work look professional."
4,Great glitter overall,"Initially I loved this assortment pack of glitter. I bought it to add to my 4 year old daughters ever building arts and crafts supplies. However, while the colors are great and it was a great deal, opening these containers were very difficult and on more than one occasion trying to open thALLem resulted in the tops flying off and glitter was ALL over the place. Other than that, I love glitter and so does my daughter :)"
1,outclassed recording,"Once you've heard the Tortelier/BBC phil. on Chandos you will not want to waste your time on this. The recording is typical early Chandos, only worse, the orchestra is 2nd-rate, and the interpretation lacks any insight. Dutoit/Montreal on Decca is worth hearing, and though I haven't heard it the Naxos disc with Kaltenbach has received some good reviews. Check the other reviews first."
3,A recommended buy!,I chose this rating because it was just what I expected it to be. I often love the history of the craft as much as the craft itself.
3,Out of Date,"Aside from the poor writing style, the financial data is very out of date. A complete revision using more recent financial data is needed to make this book relevant. Also, there are no real regional references. What markets is the data relevant too? How would one adjust the methods to different regional markets? Overall a pretty light treatment....."
1,Puzzled by this item,"This is a discontinued item, so the review is redundant. This hub is described as giving you three (3) ""additional"" FireWire ports. That's inaccurate. One of the three FireWire ports is used for the uplink connection to the computer, so you get effectively only two additional FireWire ports. The USB ports are counted correctly."
4,One huge ass cap!,"Bought it for my scoot, but it's too big for that purpose.It takes a dome light just under 20 seconds to charge/discharge the cap!Is a solid thing, just under 1ft long, and the width of a coke can!Does not have a display, good enough if you stow it away, and don't want any potential battery hogs on the cap (like a display or sensors).It's a basic cap, made out of good material.The connector pins are molded into their shape, they don't look that refined."
2,Unsure what to say,"It really did not give me any information that I did not know already,If you are not familiar with causing microfractiors you will get a greater benifit from this book than I did."
4,Russian classics,"Great introduction to the Russian writers, especially if one had thought that the prospect of getting started was going to be too heavy. Wonderful insights into the culture of the day, interesting character portrayals and an amusing slant on the fact that human nature never changes. This is a book I will be keeping on my kindle as I am sure I will come back to it again."
3,A complex yarn,"Not a bad story but for someone who reads in short bursts over a couple of weeks I had difficulty in keeping track of where I was at, not helped by the book author switching between locations and themes without recognisable breaks in the text. Particularly towards the end the links became rather obscure and the story convoluted. Like so many modern novels the storyline tests the readers imagination."
5,An incomparable adventure story,"I stumbled on this in a second-hand book and I lost sleep after I could hardly put it down. It is the story of a man marooned in the closest islands to the Antarctica and how he realistically struggles to survive (just!).I have long taken an interest in the Antarctic, and all of the details ring true.I won't say more, because I don't want to spoil the discoveries for any other reader."
4,Power House 18-Inch 3-Speed High Velocity Floor Fan #81800 Review,"High quality fan, but not able to adjust fan so it will blow level or downward."
4,Powerful but noisy,We have a rancher and use the fan to push air from one end of the house (where the air conditioner is) to the other end. Our old fan broke and it was the end of the summer. We couldn't find one in the stores so we ordered this. We miss our old one - this one is very noisy but it does the job. It also does a great job of helping defrost our upright freezer. In less than one hour the job is done.
5,Great Modern Military Magazine,"Although RAIDS is written in French, it is still one of the best modern military magazines around. It has a section with current world military news, well written articles on various armed forces of the world, a section with new weapons and equipment and a final section where a new weapon is detailed. Anyone interested in modern military weapons, equipment and the armed forces of the world will find this a great buy."
4,It is helpful,It is helpful for teacher more than useful for parents who want to do some extra curriculum work with their kids at home
2,Came broken - had to return - But good for sensory diet,We got this and it was broken. All of the pins were loose in the box. Later I bought a plastic version of this toy. I have a son with sensory problems and he loved the way this felt on his feet and hands. Make sure this toy (or other pin art toy) stays out of the toybox.
4,good knick.knack,"Bought this as a travel toy for my two young daughters. No problems with it breaking or coming apart even though it is tossed around a little. It's fun, not necessarily educational, but best of all it's quiet. A few pins sometimes stick together but I wouldn't say is bent."
1,MISSION: ...,You've GOT to be kidding me! Another bland pop album with no substance whatsoever. Production is ok. No emotion to the vocals. Boring and very unoriginal. Next please...
2,LOOK OUT!,"Pretty tight vocals, but not much going on in the music dept. Do you realize lyrics aren't even necessary if the music is good? A stark contrast to Ears Eye, which is also an anti-establishment, non-affiliated FREE music site. To find it so you can compare it to the Rosenbergs, just type earseye.com into your browser and see how those guys stack up to the Rosenbergs."
1,Doesn't cover VBA,I was looking for a book which covered VBA programming in Excel 97 and this book isn't what I wanted.All the book has is a few pages on running the macro recorder.
5,Inspired to continue to make a difference.,This story has inspired and encouraged me to take my ideas or a passion that I have and set them into motion. I think everyone that reads it will feel their ability to create and make things happen in their professional & personal lives.
4,Episodes Vary In Quality,"I loved the first season of Lie to Me. It was unique and used some interesting techniques.Some of season 2 is confusing--first, why is the Lightman Group taking all these free cases, aren't they running a business? It seems that most times this season, they are pursuing a personal interest, or one of their family/staff members. So, all the talk about financial difficulty in the firm could be solved if they concentrated on their business plan.The final 3 episodes are the most compelling. They have drama, suspense, and unexpected plots. The season itself ends with a cliff hanger.I agree with others that Tim Roth's accent is difficult to understand.All in all, a fairly good season--with a few excellent episodes. Better than most things on TV these days."
4,I like it,"I ordered this as a gift for my mom, apparently she loves the series, and I wasn't disappointed. It came earlier than expected, and works as it's supposed to. The only problem I have with it is that it's not a blu-ray, but I can't seem to find this show on blu-ray anywhere so dvd is good enough."
4,I really enjoyed watching this.,The show is very informative and entertaining. I don't know how I missed watching the first two seasons of this show when it was on TV. I started watching with the new season and really wanted to go back and find out what I missed.
3,It will probably not survive much longer...,"Instead of following the Dexter formula (12 episodes seasons), this new season of Lie To Me expanded to more than twenty episodes. In this case, this implied a lsos of quality, unfortunately.THings are some how weird in this season. The freshness and sheer brilliance of the first season (however flawed or not the whole concept may be) are gone since Episode One. Tim Roth, however, is still great to watch, as is Gillian Foster (forgot the name of the actress).BUt thing are kind of formulaic here. A lot of episodes are completely stand-alone. And they killed Spike!!"
1,Dissatisfied,Half the disc's in the series would not play in DVD player or on my computer. Disk's do not appear damaged but damaged message appears on screen and play freezes. DON W. ROBERTS
5,Gone too soon!!,Lie to me was without a doubt one of the best shows on during its run.. Why a show of this quality is gone and other crap is still running is beyond me..
2,"First season perfect, the second not inspiring at all","The first season of Lie too me was so fresh and inspiring. Unfortunately the second one does not have this freshness anymore, the plots have become very predictable, nothing new, very little (psychological) analysis as well, boring, boring, boring...I do think that it will be cancelled after the third season because there is nothing else left to tell."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"I don't wash my hair everyday--too dry--so these sheets are an answer to a prayer---add just enough moisture and styling to pop my ""do"" right back in place."
1,Metric system!! - ever heard of it?!!,"Rubbish.Why? no metric system - but then what would you expect.Here's a lesson, in other parts of THE WORLD tape measures have BOTH measuring systems, but not in the US apparently.What a shame.Pop quiz: How many inches in 160 miles? how many centimetres in 160 kilometres?Had my answer in 5 seconds. As would anyone using a superior measuring system.I'm sure i'll get some flack for this post... but then, so did the people knew the world was round."
1,THIS IS LOUSY!,I accidentally came upon this book and boy was it a complete and utter waste of time! This author is so boring and obviously in over his head to think he can actually be a successful author. 2 thumbs down. Save your money or else buy some REAL literature!
3,Not compatible with Iphone,If you have an iPhone this unit will not let you push all your contacts (phone numbers) to your radio which blows. Reason being is that this module uses the OPP bluetooth profile and most newer phones use another one. U can only answer/hang up and that's about it.
2,I will get back with you on the review,"Having technical difficulty with the voice command function not playing back through the speakers. Phone gets command ok, but cannot hear responce."
2,ERROR 80 code!!,"I just got this and I am having difficulty with it. It keeps giving me a code that reads ""Error 80.""No clue what it is, much less why! The calls just drop and to reset it, you have to turn the car off and turn it back on.So far, not very happy with it. I would just return it and be done with this error code thing!!!!!!!"
3,Clear as a bell in the beginning.. but now not working.,"LOVE IT !I have had three previous bluetooth cell phone handsfree devices, this is the best yet, connects quickly, is CLEAR AS EVER and has more options that even I have used.Phone book feature is a bit difficult to get to work. have not got that going as yet.UPDATEAfter 3 years I now get an ERROR 80 everytime I try to use this device. It is very very disappointing to have this happen after I have had such great usage.As I have another cellphone blue tooth kit (Parrot) available Free, I will try that now instead.So I guess i should lower my star rating to 3/5"
1,"Used to be good, now it's terrible","I own two of these units. They are over 3 years old at this point. Neither unit has reliable performance with my wife's iPhone 3GS or my iPhone 4. We get drop-outs during bluetooth audio playback, and call quality is very choppy most times.The other gripe is that the unit will only automatically connect to the programmed device in the first registered slot, registered slots 2 and 3 must be manually connected. This is a pain when my wife and I switch cars.Finally, there is no external usb connector on the device, so there is no way for Pioneer to perform software updates on these devices in the field. I suspect the engineers at Pioneer did not expect this device to be on the market for as long as it has been.On balance, I would avoid this device and go with a head-unit that has bluetooth technology integrated into the head unit. This one isn't up to the task."
3,"Works. Would buy again, still room for improvement.","Works as advertised. Sound quality very good. You can install this yourself if you know how to install car stereos. If not, you might want to get some help from your local installer. Auto-answer works great. My radio automatically switches to the phone, rings twice, and picks up. After the call it switches back. Areas for improvement: 1) phone book - you should be able to easily transfer your phone book to this unit, but you probably can't. The unit is set up to work with a phone that can ""push"" the phone book. Both my phones can let another device ""pull"" the phone book, but neither can push. So both my phone and this device sit there waiting for the other to start. Very annoying. 2) you can't use any of the advanced functions unless your parking brake is on. For example, you can't manually pair a phone, dial a number on the radio screen or anything like that unless your parking brake is on (this applies to radios with built in DVD players only)."
2,Background noise!!!,The install was a snap....it's easy to use.... but I have yet to find a place to put the mic where it doesn't pick up EVERYTHING. There needs to be a way to adjust the mic sensitivity. I get very little complaints from the other end of the line when sitting still with the engine off but if the truck is in motion everyone says there is too much background noise to clearly understand me.
1,this item is not compatible with my HTC LEGEND!!!!!!,"Well this was pro intalled , and my blackberry works like a charm but it refuses to work with my HTC LEGEND PIONEER PEOPLE SHUT PUBLISH A LIST OF WELL PAIR DEVICES (COMPATIBLES PHONES), so you will know ."
2,Muzic with Pioneer CD-BTB200,After hours of setup I was never able to get the mp3 of my Muzic cell phone to connect as an mp3 player. It works great for the phone call feature but not for music.
3,OK,"I have to try to connect 2x everytime I get in the car before it works. Was not able to upload contact either. Maybe it's a Sprint, Samsung Q issue?"
2,Read the fine print first,"Pros-It works as a handsfree device for talking only and can play bluetooth audio, that is itCons-Outdated bluetooth version with no way to update it. This module is so outdated for bluetooth that the functions they sale you on does not even work. the bule tooth version is almost 4 years old and with newer phones it won't even give you the abilty to see caller ID's or dial a number. Pioneer's web site states that your phone will work with it, but again this information is for phones that are over 4 years old and not the newer ones.They are better bluetooth, handsfree items out there. Don't waste your money on this"
3,Check your head unit compatibility,"I have an AVH-P4200DVD head unit and paired the bluetooth to a Samsung Vibrant. All this add-on is capable of is making and receiving calls, and storing a couple of the dialed/received numbers. Even this call log cuts off most of the phone number, so you have to mentally know what the full number is. I gave it three stars because it does do what I originally wanted which is hands free operation and the sound/voice quality is good. It just sucks knowing all the things this could be capable of and none of it working on a seven inch touch screen."
2,Eh...,Love the Bluetooth audio portion. Have not had very good luck with the Bluetooth Wireless to work with my DROID. So for phone service purposes would give this 2 thumbs down. Was a real bummer.
5,Great product,"I installed this Bluetooth adapter on a Pioneer DEH-3100B in my Ford F250 Super Duty truck. Anyone who's ever ridden in an F250 at highway speeds knows that they aren't the quietest vehicle on the road, and I was worried about background noise when using the Bluetooth. So far everyone I've talked to says it sounds great with no background noise at all. A couple have even said it sounds better than the built-in Bluetooth in my 2008 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I am very satisfied with this product."
3,Good trees but a bit small,"I wear a 9 and ordered medium. They don't fill out the entire front of the shoe. I keep them in a pair of shoes in a locker at work so they are absolutely fine for that and that is why they got 3 stars. Maybe the large would have been better...but it's only a 9 shoe.If you want to keep the creases out of your shoes or stretch them get ""the next size up"" or get something else."
2,FOREPART NOT HIGH ENOUGH,"These highly aromatic shoe trees fill the width of the shoe satisfactorily. However, because the forepart is low, it doesn't exert sufficient pressure against the vamp (upper part of shoe). Barely contoured, it looks virtually flat. In a size large, it measures 1.75"" from top to bottom at the highest point. My other shoe trees, on the other hand, are 2"" high at the same spot.The objective is to smooth out the wrinkles in the leather, but when the vamp is not completely filled, this won't happen. My shoes developed deep creases despite the use of these shoe trees. It's not advisable to go up one size, as the shoes will likely overstretch at the width.Since they inadequately fulfill one of their most important functions, these shoe trees are not recommended."
3,Sizing is a little off,"I went by the sizing displayed, but the one I got was too big. I a lso don't like how t here's no way to keep the toe part from spreading width wise. I'd rather just stretch forward a bit."
1,Deceitful Merchant,"I ordered 3 pairs of tree shoes and, besides their modest quality, all six of them were for the left shoe!"
3,Forepart is too low,"I agree with another reviewer that the forepart is not high enough, other than that a good buy. Information found on the back on the box is helpful too."
3,very well made,"these shoe trees seem very well made to me. this is not a product i use very often or have much of knowledge about so take that into account.I bought them because a very nice and rather expensive pair of shoes always felt stiff when i put them on in the morning. i found out that the leather expands as you where it and the moisture from your feet mess with the leather. Anyway its better to use shoe tree's, they are suppose to help extend the life of the shoe.I would recommend these for anyone with a larger foot, they work well for me"
1,IS NOT WATERPROOF !!!!!!!,"This fuse holder IS NOT, IS NOT, IS NOT WATERPROOF!!! It could be considered water resistant or maybe splashproof, but NOT WATERPROOF. I had purchased 50 or so of these to use under the hood of police cars as the main siren/lightbar fuse and now after about 8-12 months of service, all of the cars have trouble with poor voltage at the control box because of corrosion in the fuse holder. No matter where I have installed it under the hood or which way I have positioned the holder water seems to always get in. I have made them work by applying some silicone grease to the contacts, but I will not use any more of these. This same style holder is sold as waterproof everywhere so be careful and look closely at what you are getting."
2,Not a good book,Yes it is true that there is a lot of mess in this protocol suite but it would be more helpful if there was more infomration on CIFs itself and less cynical remarks and private opinions. For example the description of the SMV commands and parameetrs is very sparse.It would be faster to read the CIFS guide from microsoft or the SNIA reference (both can be downloaded freely)to understand the protocol. Maybe later this book may help in some few corner cases which have more details.
1,Low quality; lasted only for 1 bin full...,"I wasn't looking for a top-of-the-line shredder for office use - just a small, reliable one for home use to shred receipts or other similar documents with sensitive material. I was able to shred nearly 1 bin full of papers (and was happy enough) until the unit just stopped shredding. I thought perhaps it overheated a bit and needed a cool-down period, but even a week later it will no longer shred...it will reverse (used for unclogging the shredders), but will not run forward. Perhaps I just got a bum model, but my replacment will not be a Fellowes."
5,An excellent informational and guide volume,"David A. Stewart and Bryan R. Clarke are two dedicated teachers with years of experience working with deaf children. In Literacy And Your Deaf Child: What Every Parent Should Know, Stewart and Clarke effectively collaborate to create an instructional guide specifically appropriate for parents of deaf and hard-of-hearing children who want to do everything they can to ensure their hearing-impaired child learns to read and write with fluency and competence. Also discussed are the practices and issues of hearing aids, cochlear implants, speech reading, and sign communication. Emphasizing the developmental link between American Sign Language and English literacy for children who learn and use it, Literacy And Your Deaf Child is an excellent informational and guide volume and is very highly recommended for anyone who works with hearing-disabled children."
1,Not Much There. VERY dated,"As a Realtor in a market that has a huge influx of the over 55 market, I was hoping for a lot more information. Yes, there are charts and graphs saying Americans are getting older. However, since the book was written in 1992, the information is about 10 years old. Save your money. There is no real hard core ""How to Sell to the Seniors"" info in this book"
5,Great product,This deodorant works great. No odor at the end of the day. It lasts an entire year...it is dirt cheap and none of those harmful chemicals on your pits!!!
3,Stick version is too hard,"I bought the stick version of this deoderant, & found it to be too hard. It doesn't go onto your skin easily, & therefore rubs your skin in trying to apply it. It's supposed to last a year, but it should be a little softer in consistancy so that you can get enough on to work. I'm going to try the roll on."
4,Morphosis,"Mayne has been at the forefront of LA's architectural avant garde for over thirty years, graduating from meticulously detailed houses and commercial spaces, to large-scale public projects that include two LA-area schools, the Cal Trans headquarters, a Federal office building in San Francisco, and a courthouse in Oregon. Morphosis (the firm he established with Michael Rotondi in 1972) has also built in Canada, Austria and Korea. This handsome pictorial survey of its 35 completed buildings and installations offers a thrilling ride through structures that tilt, fold, cantilever and seem to defy gravity. An essay by Mayne is gently deconstructed by Cornell architecture professor Val Warke. (Michael Webb is the book reviewer for LA Architect magazine.)"
1,IRRITATING BOOK,The book contains pictures of his work and the bottom line is this --1) Poor choice of angles in the photography2) Boring images3) Annoying layout of photos in the book such as spreading the image across 2 pages that disturbs the image of the architecture.
5,Fabuloso!,"""Mi Libro Pequeno de Palabras"" is a really good choice for teaching small children Spanish vocabulary words that are useful in their everyday life. There are over 300 words with matching, full color pictures. This book has taken a lot of abuse in our household, being read over and over again. But the binding is tough and it is still holding together. This book would be good for ages 18m-6y."
2,Not what I expected,I did not expect award winning performances but the acting was crap and the movie was not good. I like the stunt people but this did not do it for me. I was ready for the movie to end at a certain point. Some parts were just too silly and the finale was too long. The fighting was good though.
5,"Edgy Brilliance, Gritty Passion!","A fierce, brilliant account of a political, artistic and personal quest: two young people in search of truth and justice end up finding love and adventure and the harsh realities of America's dark side. Blank's searing intelligence and total conviction for her cause make this book incredibly hard to put down, even as the truths it reveals are often hard to take. If you have seen ""The Exonerated,"" you will love reading the stories behind the stories on stage or film. But even if you haven't seen it, there is much to glean here about the kind of guts required to make a difference as an artist or an activist in the world today."
2,Not enough Woody!,"Too much Andy Panda and not enough Woody Woodpecker. And do we really need a ""not suitable for children"" disclaimer for cartoonsd producedd in the 40's and 50's? I saw 'em as a kid and don't think they were distasteful for kids."
2,Not suitable for small Children!!!!!,"I bought this for my nephew (7 years old) because he's really into old cartoons. Well, I was surprised to see on the back of the box after we opened the set that the ""content is intended for mature collectors and may not be suitable for children"". We watched some of it and I definitely wouldn't recommend for children that age. I now noticed the small disclaimer on amazon that it's for children 10 and older. I remember watching it when I was little, but watching it now, I do agree that it's a bit violent for small children... just wanted to let people know about this before they buy."
1,woody woodpecker,I bought this and returned it because on the box it said this was for ADULT collectors and may not be suitable for children. Since when is woody woodpecker not suitable for children? Shame
3,Great to see Woody back... But so's the DVNR...,"I don't think anyone more than I was delighted to see Universal release a compilation of the Walter Lantz titles to stores. But the restoration was very poorly done. Nearly all of these cartoons are rendered with the DVNR process (line and animation erasure), though thankfully it is minor in most circumstances.The mere selection available on this collection, though, is worth the $35 SRP. ""Abou Ben Boogie"" and ""Pass the Biscuits Mirandy"" are impossible to find outside of this collection. While I'd love to give a collection of my favorite 'forgotten' cartoons, I have to take into account the horrible restoration and give this a 3-out-of-5 star rating."
5,Woodys Here,Woody Woodpecker is very funny. Mel Blanc was a genious voicing him-when he did mostly it was the laugh-and all the other chachors he voiced. All of the shorts on here are funny. I especially like Bathing Buddies where Woody tries to get his dime back after it falls down the bath tub drain and The Reckless Driver where Woody tries in vein to renew his drivers licence not to mention Sleep Happy where woody sleeps the night away next to Wally Walrus who is kept awake by his snoring. All of them are good. Anyway this is funny and youll be disapointed if you dont get it. Especially if you watched theese as a kid like I did.
3,an authentic screwball,"I bought this DVD and it's sequelWoody Woodpecker and Friends Classic Cartoon Collection: Volume 2beacuse i'm intrested in golden age cartoons. I vaguely remember seeing some of woody's cartoons on tv as a child (he wasnt shown on tv as frequently as mickey mouse or bugs bunny); He is more simplified than other cartoon chrachters, but a very authentic 1940's screwball, very similar to bugs bunny. The restoration seems good, though sometimes the sound was a bit unclean and the cartoons are in their historical order (something Warner Bros. has yet to learn with their releases-see my previous reviews on the ""Looney Tunes Golden Collection""). It was espically intresting for me to see the 'Oswald the lukcy rabbit' b & w cartoons. I do hope Universal will continue releasing woody's and friends filmography (the sequel ends in 1958) and thus setting an important example for the other golden age cartoons yet to be digitally released."
5,"Not Complete, But There ARE TEX AVERY EPIX!","We can only hope Universal will come out with MORE! However: there are The Classic Averys with Chilly Willy (& Smedley the hound)I'm Cold has terrific music,too! Hot & Cold Penguin is another 1 as well as 1 of my ALL TIME Tex Faves: the Legend Of Rock A Bye Point! PLUS:More of Tex's Hilarity in Mixed Up Pup (the plasma gets switched &...)PLUS:1 Avery I nearly forgot about called S-h-h-h-. Leave it to Tex to take a wacky ""song""(the OKEH laughing record that Dr. Demento plays)& turn it into a classic 'toon. Ahh. Those memories! Get this! You will NOT be sorry! The Tex's are worth their weight in solid platinum!"
5,THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR!,"Finally, The Walter Lantz classics are fianlly being released. This collection includes the first 45 Woody Woodpecker cartoons from ""Knock Knock""(1940)to The Great Who Dood-It(1952). These are the cartoons where Woody Woodpecker is really insane with his famous laugh. Besides Woody Woodpecker, this collection also includes the first 5 cartoons of that loveable penguin- Chilly Willy. This collection also includes amny of the ""Swing Symphonies"" and ""Oswald the Lucky Rabbit"" Cartoons and 5 choice Andy Panda cartoons. These shorts are all uncut and restored and remastered from the original Universal Pictures Master Negatives. You won't want to miss this set. If this set sells well, there might be a volume 2."
4,Universal Opens the Walter Lantz Vault,"Animation buffs will find a treasure trove of Walter Lantz cartoons in this fascinating DVD set. It's worth having solely for the classic contributions from Tex Avery (""I'm Cold"" and ""Sh-h-h-h-h-h"") and Shamus Culhane (""The Barber of Seville"" and ""Abou Ben Boogie""). That's not all, folks! The Lantz collection includes most of the producer's Oscar-nominated shorts: ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy of Company B"" (1941), ""Musical Moments From Chopin"" (1947) and Avery's ""The Legend of Rockabye Point"" (1955). Along the way, you will find 1933 rarities such as ""King Klunk"" and ""Confidence."" Even if you're not a fan of Woody Woodpecker, Andy Panda and Chilly Willy, the three-disc set has enough Lantz gems to compensate for the occasional misfires."
4,Another case,I bought the SC-FXA04 case from Amazon for my Fujifilm v10 camera. It fit perfectly. It costs less than this case. See my other post for dimensions.
5,Clearing the fog to get back to an enjoyable life,"The workshop Chaosover.calm helped me clear my life! I was so inspired by your ruthless commitment to clearing the chaos so that our sub-conscious mind can relex, be calm. My work life is changing and becoming so much more enjoyable, where I feel the fog of fear lift and the sunshine of possibility comes in. I have plants EVERYWHERE! May you be fulfilled in your own life, satisfied with the profound knowledge that you make life free of chaos and fear of forgetting an enjoyable reality!This book and workshop will change your life - you just have to be willing to do it!"
5,The BEST book about how to use your time.,I read a lot of books about time.But this IS the best.Read this book and get things done!!!
1,Out of order,"This chart is horrible. It does not list the chords in chromatic order. Top row is A, second row goes down to A-flat, third row goes UP to B, then down to B-flat, so on. If that wasn't bad enough, the last three rows of the chart are F-sharp, G, and G-flat. I am not joking."
5,Shipping bummer,I love this poster and the price was excellant but I neglected to consider the shipping which turned out to be more than the poster itself. What was I thinking? But I am very pleased with it.
5,LAUGH OUT LOUD! FUNNY!!!!,"Six of the all time great movies. Its a must for classic movie fans. You really get to see how good Jean Harlow was at comedy in ""Dinner at Eight"". Lets not forget Carole Lombard what a great comedian and actress she was in ""To Be or Not To Be"" her last film before she was killed in plane crash. Sometimes we forget how good they really were. They just don't make good movies like these anymore. I couldn't name you a good actor today with this much staying power. There will never be another Cary Grant, James Stewart, William Powell and Katherine Hepburn. You can watch these movies over and over. I know I will.."
5,Wonderful Collection/Terrific Transfers,"I was very pleased with the collection. There were, of course, many more titles worthy of inclusion; however, perhaps in another grouping. Always great to encounter a bargain in a compilation. Individually, they would have cost much more."
3,great movies... overpriced,"i put it in my cart. shortly after, it went from $38 to $69.Just a way to squeeze a few more bucks out of diehard fans of this very old material, long since paid for. look for less expensive collections, they're out there.But Bringing up baby & philadelphia story are all time greats, so i highly recommend seeing."
5,Classic Comedies Collection,"Classic Comedies Collection (Bringing Up Baby / The Philadelphia Story Two-Disc Special Edition / Dinner at Eight / Libeled Lady / Stage Door / To Be Or Not To Be) is terrific. The resolution is beautiful and the documentaries on Jean Harlow, Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn are great."
1,E for effort,"I am agreeing to the comment of ""E for effort"" on this book.This book describes the author's attemps to improve his condition and how he suceeded. But he admits in his book that he is not sure which ones actually worked. Plus, the author also takes diabetes medications, along with other medicines and supplements. My main concern is what worked for him probably won't work for someone reading this book.This book does not really provide a clear picture on what to do. He made so many changes on the medications and supplements, it is hard to say what worked.One can find the general imformation presented in this book on ""Diet"", ""Exercise"" and ""Stress management"" (relating to clog arteries & heart diseases) through the internet. I didn't gain any new information by reading this book.The printing of this book is also done in a very strange way.The text is printed at the center, occupying only the center area with a lot of spaces around, so about half of the page is blank."

5,The Legendary Jam Sessions Buck Clayton All Stars.,They are all here. Some of the greatest musicians of any era. Ask any jazz fan if he would name his favourite player of any instrument. He would surely come up with a goodly proportion of the personel. Buck & The boysmake the joint jump. A not to be mised CD in anyones collection. Superb stuff on every track.
5,Debussy Fields Forever.,"This was the first collection of Debussy's late sonatas that I ever owned and it is still overall the most well rounded collection out there. There are finer versions available separately of each of the works on this disc, but this is the only album that brings together all of them in top drawer performances. While there are plenty of great recordings of the Violin sonata on the market, this version of the Sonata for flute, viola and harp may be the best anywhere."
3,Something's missing,"What ruins this set is the omission of the String Quartet, one of Debussy's finest works."
3,Zipper broke,Leg zipper broke on one pair after 2 times of wearing and washing. Definitely a disappointment.
3,Expensive but cute.,The cost is quite high for what it is but I needed it for Holiday photos of my Chihuahuas. The Red Bow is fixed on via Velcro (hook and loop) so theoretically you could create more looks for your pooch out of fabric you purchase later. That could help with the cost for value ratio down the road.I like them though. The XS and S would also fit on cats. If you could catch them to get it on.
2,Wall Charger,It was the right charger for my phone however my phone would not reconize the charger. It gave a message -unauthorized charger-I took it to verizon to unlock my phone so it could read the charger but all they wanted to do is sell me sell me another charger.I'm still looking..........
4,"IT'S ALWYN, ALL RIGHT","It's nice to see that Ogdon's recording of Alwyn's inventive, whimsical and quirky piano music is back in circulation. Particularly entertaining are the ""Fantasy-Waltzes,"" whose tone and direction are most definitely twentieth century, but whose winks and nods surely go to Lizst, Chopin and Schubert, however disguised. The 12 Preludes are tougher nuts to crack, the language a bit less subtle, the modernism a tad more acute. However, Ogdon has the full measure of each and plays them with authority and panache. (The recording sessions, it should be noted, were attended by Alwyn, himself; obviously, he enjoyed what he heard.) The sound (at Maltings, Snape) is first-rate: full, warm, dynamically-charged. For those of you who enjoy the piano music of such British composers as Frank Bridge, Lennox Berkeley or Arnold Bax, this CD is most definitely worth a listen.[Running time: 58:02]"
3,mm..,"Well.. there is no such name as ""Hidiaki"" in Japan.. it is Hideaki. Unless they decided to come up with a cool new name but they dont have the ""di"" sound in people's names in Japanese and it sounds just so weird."
5,The Art Drew Me In - But the Biographies Held Me!,"This well-illustrated and well-written book will fill in some of the interesting missing chapters from the story of flight. Any student of flight's first century will have developed a mental catalog of the famous fliers of the period. In this collection of refreshing biographies that Bruce Harris has woven together, most of those particular names will prove to be missing. In their place are over two hundred of the less recognized pioneers of flight. In reading this book, I will hazard to guess that you'll meet at least two dozen people for the first time. Fill in a few missing chapters from the story of flight from the pages of this well-researched and enjoyable book."
2,Blah.....,"I expected so much more from Cheryl Dunye...this movie is just what the title of the subject I chose is..""blah""..The best part of the movie was the END.overall, I am not impressed."
1,where can I get this book?,"I want this book, but I can't find anywhere in the world!!!!! What's up with this book?!!! Can they remake? The game is great, but it's too hard. Without the strategy guide, I can't enjoy playing the game any longer."
4,Kept me engaged,"Vivid descriptions of San Francisco and Mexico rang true for this reader. The author paced the plot quite well and that kept me wanting to read on. As the story twists, some of the characters develop in directions you didn't expect from the outset while others act more predictably. It's a well-crafted first novel and I'm waiting for the next one !"
3,Difficult task,Almost impossible to give definition to the complex history of Germany in one volume. Good introductory work but as a research tome it is limited.S.J.Tagliareni author of Hitler's Priest
4,high velocity fan,Amazon once again had a merchant who did not fill the order. The fan is in cyberspace. The company cannot find them.
5,Musical Prodigy,"Joe Bonamassa is a blue/rock musical phenomenon that is awe-inspiring to anyone who will take the time to listen to his music. In his musical style/class, I would count him the second greatest musician on the planet - with Walter Trout weighing in first place. As you can easily see from all of the other reviews, I believe that you will find this CD well worth purchasing - as I have found all his material is. (After purchasing this item, I eventually went on to purchase everything he produced and haven't been disappointed.) As with any CD, you may not like all the selections but I believe the vast majority of his material you will. Among my favorites on this CD are: `Pack It Up', `You Upset Me Baby', and `Man of Many Words'. Bonamassa is an extraordinary adept and versatile musician. Since he is young and gifted, we can expect many more superb CD's in the future. Highly recommended."
3,Just OK!.,"I liked ""Had To Cry Today"" a lot better, I just seem to like his orignals better then Covers, although it's not bad, by any means."
3,Simmer down,"This phenom is getting major hype, huge kudos from newbies, some of it merited. He's got guitar chops, but is not original, and still has absolutely nothing on the generations of great blues guitar masters before him, whose stuff he's cobbled together into a slick commercial sound. Take the title track: Jeff Beck+ Stevie Ray Vaughan+ Buddy Guy+shreddy 80s/90s style is the end result, and you may still wind up thinking, hm, I've still heard better, more soulful, more honest. Go listen to some Guitar Slim, Roy Buchanan, Mike Bloomfield, Elmore James, the Kings, Icepick, etc. etc."
5,Pandora Picked it Right!,"Pandora picked it right! Now that I have DSL I can listen to Pandora internet radio at home, and my favorite ""channel"" is my SRV one. All Blues, all the time. Up comes Joe Bonamassa's ""Blues Deluxe"" album, and I'd never heard him before. Made me come to a complete STOP and go into a trance. This guy really has it. I wish I could go to a live concert with him and Stevie Ray Vaughn - it would be the ultimate blues show.Had to come out of my trance just to do this review! SOLD!"
4,Never falls short....,"I love, love, love Joe Bonamassa! This is the type of blues that will pass for new because of the artist, but has the feel of some of the best blues men to grace us with their talent and passion for the blues. This CD does not dissapoint!"
5,awesome,"best music purchase in years.if you like great guitar,you will love this.every track is good,not just 1 or 2 songs. just recently discovered bonamassa,and so glad i did.my new ""guitar hero"",see ya clapton"
5,SIX Stars! The best overall guitarist alive!,"Joe Bonamassa is about the only young white blues-based artist that recorded an album in the year 2003 that was a true tribute to the 100th birthday of blues music. This guy is amazing! If you like ultra-soulful, smoking blues, look no further than this album. Joe picks up where Kenny Wayne Shepherd left off in 1999 and takes it to newer heights. He can also shred like a mother when he feels like it, and his volume knob tricks are straight out of the Walter Trout trick book. And he's a great singer! Joe is the blues-rock savior of the world! Buy this and the rest of his catalogue--you won't regret it!!!!"
4,Joe Bonamassa - Pays Homage To The Blues Masters,"More outstanding blues rock from one of this country's top young blues guitar slingers Joe Bonamassa. On this, his 3rd album, Joe does an album of mostly covers. Bonamassa breathes fresh new life into tracks originally performed by blues masters like Albert King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy, Elmore James, Albert Collins, Robert Johnson and others. He also throws in a few original tracks as well. This is a very good blues album in many ways. Bonamassa covers all kinds of guitar styles here on electric, acoustic and slide. His interpretations of blues classics pay homage to the original versions, but Joe is able to put his own stamp on all of them. His cover of John Lee Hooker's ""Burning Hell"" is especially effective. Bonamassa continues to be one of the great young new blues talents on the circuit today and this is another very good album."
5,A Modern Classic,"Joe Bonamassa is one of the premiere blues guitarists of our time. His refinement of the genre is reflected in Blues Deluxe through sophisticated, extended soliloquies that enchant the listener and leave one craving more. Blues Deluxe is a conversation stopper and Bonamassa's greatest achievement so far. It is destined to become a classic. This CD should appeal to all levels of blues listeners."
4,Good foundation for kids' fitness,"This book is well-written, and approaches yoga at a good level for kids.The authors have selected a good variety of movements, and presented them in a format that make them accessible to kids. There is a mixture of easy and not-so-easy positions, and instructions for how to start simple and get more advanced as the child progresses.There is also ample instruction for the adult who is overseeing their practice. I haven't had a lot of exposure to yoga myself, but I got enough information from the book that (with a little preparatory work on my part) I felt confident in knowing how to get them in the right position while watching out for any problems.(Note to the sharp-eyed: No, I'm not related to the author)"
4,Yoga for Children,"I like the book. It was purchased as a gift for a 10 year old. I like that it teaches the names of the asanas, also has good demonstation photos."
5,Good book for working with children,This book is nicely illustrated and provides instruction on a range of poses. Group activities are included and some adaptations for children with special needs. Some poses are adapted to chair positions for those without mobility. Some breath instruction is included. All in all a good starting place to work with children at home or in groups.
2,Doesn't help to solve the fear patterns,I was looking for solutions -- and I didn't find what would work for me in this book. I really wish it had!
5,Excellent,"Where to start? Jose is a man of much wisdom. If everyone in the world read this book and assimilated the information, global Utopia would ensue."
5,It really works,"These deodorants don't smell, leave residue, or irritate healty skin. They simple do what a deodorant is suppose to do without all the fancy stuff and it's cheap and last for more than a year."
5,Rapturous quality,"My house has about 40 shelves filled with CDs. This CD makes it to my favorite shelf, i.e., the top 50. There is a glowing quality to the sound. This is lush, ultra romantic music. Ignore the fact that this is merely the Ulster Orchestra. Under Handley here they sound more like the old Philadelphia. (I have never been displeased with Handley, and I've heard a lot of his recordings.) If you are familiar only with a few Delius short pieces, try these somewhat longer works. There is one great tune after another -- kind of like what you hear in a Tchaikovsky ballet. Very highly recommended."
2,I'd love to know if I like this or not.,"It has been over a month now since I ordered this item, but I still have not received it."
4,Very user friendly,"I bought this for my 7 year old CubScout for camp. On our nature hike, the camp staff referred to it repeatedly to answer the groups questions. We ended up donating it to the camp at the end of the week and buying another copy for ourselves. The pictures are large and detailed, very easy to use."
5,Great study!,"I bought this book for my women's life group at church. We have just started the study, but I am already seeing people seriously evaluating how to stop some of the craziness and stress in their own lives! I am too! I like that it doesn't just ask for ""fill in the blank"" answers, but instead makes you take time to think about how to apply it to your own life! It is important that you do this study with a group of women you trust because members of the group holding each other accountable is what will make this study work."
4,Great collectible for the fan!,Led Zeppelin bigger than the Beatles? Here's the remarkable story of the swashbuckling Robert Plant - the rocker who left a wake of groupies and rubble in his rise to success as the lead singer of the most popular band in the history of the world. Circus Magazine presents the startling tale of the world's biggest rock group - Led Zeppelin - and a first hand account of Robert Plant's ascent to super stardom (up to 1975). Book includes rare photos from the files of Circus Magazine!
5,GO ZABORGAR GO!,"Wow. Sushi Typhoon did something that alot of recent reboots have not been able to accomplish, they kept the heart of the show intact. In the process of ""modernizing"" old shows, reboots throw in high tech special effects, glamorous actors, adult sexuality but unfortunately lose all the charm of the original. Zaborgar was a childhood favorite of mines. I'm so glad that this update retains all the campy, goofy, heartfelt goodness of the original without compromising for the jaded audiences of today. All the characters from the old series are back in this neat, entertaining movie!"
2,Zaborgar,"Ridiculous, total out of this world ....bad story cheesy effects...don't waste ur money catch it on Showtime extreme at 4am...."
4,Not too bad!,"The overall quality of this bag is fantastic! It's very durable and functional. The drain hole at the bottom is a great little feature, too. However, the straps for which to attach your poles are way, WAY too long/big. I've had to modify them in order to get my poles to stay put, hence my 4 star rating."
5,Great Bag!,"This is a very tough bag! My MSR Lightning Ascents will be safe now and so will my new Hestra Patrol leather gloves! There is a place for your poles, a handle and strap, what else would you need? Now when the powder hits I'll have everything ready to go!!!"
4,snowshoes' best friend,"This is the perfect place to stow your snowshoe gear. It has a carry-handle, shouler strap (if your hands are full), and best of all, a hanging loop, so you can stow your snowshoes in it, and hang it on a peg to store it without taking up any valuable real estate in your garage. It also has straps for your adjustable poles, making it easy to carry everything you need in one package.One caveat is, I wish there was a nice, clean way to put your name on it---a monogramming service, perhaps, or a clear pocket to put your name tag in it. My friends have the same bags, too, so sometimes it's confusing as to which bag belongs to whom! Otherwise, I love this bag, and it's waterproof, so it's very easy to clean, and keep my car from getting dripping wet from the shoes."
1,Walk the halls?,"I was very disappointed when I read this book. I was hoping to read cutting-edge research on leadership supported by personal experiences. However, what I got was a book full of personal anecdotes. Do I really need to pay someone $25 to tell me to build a rapport with my teachers and students? Walk the halls? Isn't that just common sense? Waste of time and money"
3,ok- better versions out there,The authors have done a rather textbook version of the same information. The previous editions of this book are much more readable and enjoyable.
2,=(,I bought this at Amazon.com from an Awesome Deal I found on DailyTool.com. I don't like this book too much because it dropped its value too much. I bought this at $50 and now it goes to two cents.
4,Worth it,Well this product pretty much did what I needed it to do. My dishwasher rack was rusting and getting stains on my dishes. This item was very easy to use and covered up the rust so that it no longer stains my dishes. Good product
4,Good Fun,"Don't let the other review(s) make you uneasy. This rifle isn't a piece of crap. Although it needs to be used carefully (it is plastic) the gun can still function properly as long as you don't drop it all the time, etc. This may be a rifle, but it probably isn't as accurate as you would want, you can still hit a pop can from about ten feet away easily. If you are willing to pay at least fifty bucks for a rifle, go ahead. If you want to get a rifle for an amount that doesn't leave you broke, than this is not a bad rifle for 35 bucks."
5,really good gun,"Pros: Can hold 250 rounds in the reservatory, great fire power around the upper 200s, and has really good accuarcy up to 50 yards then it curves a little to the left plus it is amazling easy to cockCons: NoneOverall: This is a nice intermidate rifle with pretty good accuarcy and speed. Buy this gun it is nice"
2,DOnt listen to them,"they dont know what theyre talking about. I got this gun about a year ago, and sometimes it doesnt shoot. It shoots straight down. It requires full assembly. Yes, it shoots hard, but if your looking for a good spring rifle, your going to have to go for something $90 or higher."
2,m16 review,"I have just got my gun and this gun is just an plastic , my old gun is all medal really heavy this is 2 pound plastic , and it does not shoot through bottle and glass . the worst part is that no auto fire . BAD BAD BAD gun don't buy it"
2,This Gun Is Not What You Think!!!!!!!!!!!1,"when I ordered this gun a couple days ago, it was very appealing to me. When i got home and opened the shipping box, i was boiling with anticipation. But it was an M16A3, not a M16A1. It was also missing pieces. My gun looks cool, but the bottom of the box was missing and there was scratches on the back of the gun. The gun was able to hold allot of bbs but the barrel was kinda bent. In a slight breeze, the bbs went way off and missed but it is pretty accurate on a calm day. the gun has a lot of reality to it but it weighs about 1 pound."
5,Great Gun,"This is a great gun it has far range, and it is very accurate. Good for long range sniping."
4,great gun,"this gun is great!!it has a few flaws but its still amazing! i got the gun today and people say the plastic is cheap, it isnt cheap. the flaws are: if u cock it and point it to the ground the pellets fall out, the plastic is....well plastic, and its single shot. The good things are that it shoots really hard, pretty accuret, hods lots of pellets, looks real, and is just fun! i recamend it to anyone!!!"
1,Ehhh,"Very crappy for airsofting, cheap plastic that breaks if you even sneeze on it the wrong way. Not worth it. Not to mention it came the very last day of the time frame for shipping. WASTE OF MONEY."
1,dont buy this thing-it sucks,this thing was pretty awesome for the first 10 shots. The loading chamber the broke and i had to send it back. dont get this gun
5,RC Truck Body,"This fits like a glove on my HPI E Firestorm. I cut it out and painted it up and realized that the truck is actually .60 thick. Man is it tough. I had it skidding on it's roof on asphalt and it still didn't wear through, just some scratches. Very impressive. Nice looking body on the race track. Looks almost like a Grave Digger body."
5,The one and only guide to small arms,"I am an individual who has worked in the realm of the governments and military's of the world. This is the one and only unclassified guide to small arms of the world, outside of Jane's defence publications. Ezell and Smith have published the only book that is widely used by small arms enthusiasts and people who rely on small arms information in their daily work. I only regret it is out of copy."
5,Small Arms of the World,This book is The Bible of small arms worldwide and the price was a pitance of what the book is worth.
5,The definitive work on the subject of military small arms,"Absolute must for any student of small arms and weaponry. A wealth of information! I hope another author will fill Ezell's shoes and revise this work in a new edition. Ian Hogg, are you reading this??"
1,Used book,Book arrived in timely manner. Found that 20 pages were missing from book and that no info about this was mentioned in destription of book at time of purchase. Will not but from this source again in the future.
5,Excellent Railroad History written by a Pro,"The author is one of America's finest railroad and transportation historians and he is at his best in writing about his home territory in Minnesota, Iowa and the Upper Midwest. I was curious about the M& St. L from seeing as a kid its locomotives featured in Lionel's O-gauge catalog and this book will satisfy any rail fan or railroad professional's curiosity about this ""fallen flag."" Don does an excellent job in bringing the railroad to life. Although not having enough photos to my liking, Don makes up for it in a subsequent volume ""The Minneapolis & St. Louis Railway: A Photographic History."" This volume will be a classic and is well worth the price and 5 stars."
1,Forget about this remote. Samsung did!!,"The most illogical operation of any universal remote I've seen. I've got a ProntoNG, a Pronto, a Neo, 3 OneForAll, & quite a few others. I bought this for its clean looks but the device is so poorly designed that it's useless to me. For instance, on the Satellite screen, there is no ""Guide"" button. Duh! When you program codes for a device, the ratio of actual buttons that work for that device is maybe 3 out of 10. The rest you have to ""learn"" from the original remote & this SAM2000 runs out of memory very quickly. I tried to get additional help from Samsung online, but they don't even list it as a product they made or support. I'm sure they're trying to forget they even made this POS. Save your money for something else.....Anything else!"
1,Was advertised as having Macros. NOPE.,"This device was advertised as having 12 macros with 10 layers of 10 functions. Regarding V.Bells review, the ""extensive catalog"" doesn't refer to the macro functions at all. I believe this was a marketing error and await a response from Samsung. The manual is poorly written as well (poor Japanese translation). I cannot get this unit to ""learn"" hardly anything from the other remotes. I too have had many remotes. Some of the more sophisticated were Pronto, Neo, OFA, etc. The sam2000 isn't even near this league of remotes. This remote just wasn't planned out very well. The programmable remote codes don't work for my very mainstream Pioneer dvd player and Sony reciever. Do yourself a favor and buy the cheapest learning remote you can for $12.00 and you've done much better than this remote can do for you. You will be disappointed with this remote."
1,"Absolutly no support, can not prgm+learn 1 key",Program a device and then try to make a key to learn and it losses the programed code. Can not find any technical support from Samsung.
1,awkward to use in the short time when not defective,"As the preprogrammed modes did not control but the most commonplace functions on my tv and audio set, I quickly started using its learning interface. After teaching many codes, it worked reasonably well, though at the time of buying I did not expect I would have to push many buttons before I could get to the desired device.Then, it lasted roughly 2 weeks. Afterwards, no matter what I did it locked up with a 0999 message for a few seconds, and did not take any new codes until a removed and reinserted the batteries.SAVE YOUR MONEY."
4,no macros :(,Overall a good remote for the price. Not as good as a logitech but I can get it to learn commands. Not all of the preprogrammed codes work so you have to learn the commands for those devices which sucks (can get tedious).The bad part is the advertised macro function. It is nowhere to be found. The only so called macro function is the master power feature which can turn on and off multiple devices.
4,BYE BYE 6 remotes hello 1 remote with pretty screen,I had 6 remote controls-cable-tv-receiver-cd-dvd-vcrNO I HAVE ONLY ONE - which my wife and my coffetable loveThe price was far below competitors for the same unit(like $50 CHEAPER!!!!)Programming took sometime but its only once even if the batteries die. The only complaint I have is ....the name of the buttons on the LCD screen can NOT be changed!!So in short you have to remember where you put the not so typical buttons...admittedly after a couple of days this was not an issue.
2,Lacking in features,"The learning remote does not learn. It only learns certain commands. I tried to get it to work with my new AOC 20"" lcd tv and it only learns on, off and channel up/down, from the old remote. The codes listed for AOC don't work and code search doesn't find a code for the TV. Be careful when buying, don't use for any new components."
4,Review,"easy to use and can replace all remotes owned. also has function to ""learn"" functions of remotes that codes are not available for. good product!"
2,Learning is irritating,"Learning other remote functions really blows. The worst part is not being able to have the volume stay the same regardless of what component you've highlighted---you can do this, but then the channel control has to be from the same remote. Can you say LAME?!?!?! For those of us with receivers that control volume, and VCR/Sat/Dish, this is just lame. You get what you pay for with this. The backlighting is very cool."
1,There's no macro function.,"Nothing good about this remote.There's no macro function. Amazon wrongly states it has.Learning function requires to program either none or every button. You can't add or change one or two buttons on existing brand-specific code-tables. Code tables themselfs aren't complete.LCD icons aren't customizable, too small to see.It's not a touch-screen.My purchase goes back :("
3,It could be much better if the manual was a bit more helpful,"I bought this hoping that I wouldn't have to spend so much on a more expensive learning remote. Finally, it's all set up but it was not without its hardships.First of all, you must point the remote that is ""teaching"" the unit at the bottom of this controller. The manual doesn't really go out of its way to clarify a confusing point. It's tricky to line the remotes up correctly during the learning process. Once I got the hang of it, I was able to program my other remotes in, but even now I have troubles sometimes. Basically when you find a spot, don't flinch or move because then you have to find it again.With that said, I give it a 3 because it seems to work fine now. I just don't like programming it!"
1,<- ZERO STARS -- Do NOT purchase this product.,"The only reason I can think to recommend buying the SAM2000 would be to get in early on the class action law suit that will no doubt result from the corporate malfeasance that got it to market. The unit simply does not work. It's really that bad.I bought this hoping to use it with my TiVo. Some of the basic functions (Play, Pause, Record) work, but the menu button will not -- and it won't learn new commands. The learn function literally does nothing but flash an ""ERR"" message (and chirp an annoying BUZZ).I would doubt very seriously that this unit was tested at all by its manufacturer. I figured the other reviewers were exaggerating (or not technically inclined). They were right; and man, was I wrong.ZERO stars. Do not buy this product.Amazon staff - you should remove the SAM2000 from your inventory and sue its distributor."
1,This remote isn't worth a wooden nickle!!!,"I ordered this remote in the hopes that I can remove all other remotes from service since I have a pile of them for many devices. No such luck! The TV was a simple setup. PIP didn't want to configure and the buttons all scrambled as to which one did what, but I could work with that. Cable...that's another story. Almost NONE of the controls worked with it even though I reprogramed the buttons to try to get more functions. Learning remote is not the case for what you would need. It learns terribly! It wouldn't control my surround sound any at all! DVD worked at first for most functions, but then started loosing functions and I kept having to reprogram them into it over and over. I'll not go into the VCR as it was another nightmare. So, basicly what I'm saying is the only way I would give this remote 5 stars is if I was rating it for a patience practicing device. WORTHLESS. Mine is now in the trash."
1,Not worth the money,No wonder Samsung discontinued this product. Hard to program and not user friendly. I definetly regret the purchase of this product. TRASH!
4,Great watch -- though not perfect,"Pros:- Very attractive watch- Solar powered and doesn't require battery changes- Lots of info: time, day of the week, date, moon phaseCons:- Difficult to set. This is the only watch I've ever owned which required me to carefully read the directions!- The ""date"" on the watch is not very smart. It assumes all months have 31 days so on shorter months you need to manually adjust the date or else it will be wrong."
2,The Shot Missed,"This book, along with The Grid, is a miss for Phillip Kerr. The Bernie Gunther novels are excellent, gritty, realistic portrayals of a flawed investigator in pre-war, during the war, and post-war Germany. In The Shot he tries to create a plausible scenario for a Cuban/CIA/KGB/whatever assassination of JFK. There is no character in this book to sympathize with, with the possible exception of the college boys whose room is used for the assassination attempt, or the prostitute named Summer. All of the other characters are despicable beings. I finished the book, but had to drag myself through."
2,When did Kerr lose his imagination?,"His latest effort is a poor combination of 'American Tabloid' and 'Libra'. Spent too much time demonstrating his knowledge of uninteresting 60's cultural details. The dialogue was flat, the characters heartless.Pointless."
4,They do the job!,"I purchased these for my niece, who is a clarinetist. She is quite pleased with them. Blah blah blah blah"
2,"Uneven, at best","The subtlety of the book's first 2/3s is haunting and gives the reader a glimpse into Japanese soldiers beyond the Westernized kamikaze-type warrior. That said, there is a plot twist which is ludicrous and breaks the entire mood and flow of the piece. Then, in the last few pages, the book regains its composure. The plot twist I refer to, without giving anything away, would be more fitting in one of those horrible B-movies you see.Want true Eastern writing? Go with The Old Capital. Beauty in all that takes place beneath the surface."
3,An interesting at best story,"So, Michio, you decided to write a book. Good for you! Could you decide on your writing style, though? The sentance structure is horrible, and the use of pronouns could be used to the book's advantage"
1,why do I have to give this even one star?,"Reading this book was a terrible experience. The soldiers with or without their musical instruments are certainly not innocents, but the narrative is excusatory and pallid propoganda at best. Intensely distasteful in its attempt at emotional manipulation of the reader."
1,This Is Boring Michio very!,"I have read this book and thought it was boring. They stood around singing all the time with a harp with their buddy Mizushima wondering where in the world he is almost throught the entire story. I would have to agree with JLockhorn this could have been better. I also think it could have a little bit more action, like The Things They Carried."
5,Amazing!,"I loved ""Taken"". From the first moment I started watching it, I was hooked. That was two days and two hours each night for a week. ""Taken"" is really just about life and change and the decisions we make. This miniseries really touched me. I loved it."
2,Totally Overrated,"First off I must preface this by saying I only watched the first two Episodes. That being said, they were a huge disappointment. The story was mediocre at best and the acting was also sub par. The special effects and the aliens were lackluster as well. The visual effects team should watch Farscape and Stargate SG-1 and try not to get too embarassed.There must have been at least four times during the first episode where something so ridiculous happened that it completely drew me out of the experience. I like to call these ""what the hell?!"" moments. Four in one hour is bad news.After the first episode I didn't really have much interest in the show, but I watched the second episode just be sure. My disappointment was confirmed. :-/"
2,Masterpiece of lies,"At the beginning all seem perfect, so perfect. The cast, the music the story, but later all become the brick of a wall of contradictions.I like the work of Spielberg, but if there is something I hate it's when someone try to make me believe in something with a bunch of bad facts.Taken its a miniseries about to stories: The first one: the tragedy of the people who were abducted, and the hunt of the alines who maken it. The second (and the worst): The kindness of the aliens agains't the evil forces of the agency who are hunting them.But what it's worst of these show: in the end the story tell nothing new about the abductions (except of course the chance of the aliens after all what they did, they could be a good race). There's no new and good theory about these theme, just an story were the good people are almost saints and the bad people seems to be sons of the devil, and in a show who try to be something serious about a theme like this, this is a big and unforgiven sin."
1,You have to be kidding!,"...I watched it twice, hoping the second time around all of it would make more sense, but all the whiskey in the world couldn't make it much more enjoyable. AI was the same way, at first, sure it was enjoyable, but as it all progressed, it seemed like Spielberg was just trying to cram in every old scifi cliche into the ending. You want quality science fiction? Save your money, don't buy this DVD and invest in getting the entire Farscape Series..."
1,Not so Taken,"I tried to watch this series, but I found it to be long, slow, heavy-handed and lacking in any climax. The characters were not well developed, and continued to remain two-dimensional throughout. I finally gave up caring about any of the heroes in this story. Although it is a fantasy, it was so heavily played, that it was unrealistic, and my imagination never was peaked by the saga of this incredibly stupid family. I truly did not like this mini series and would never waste my time on it again."
1,Short & Sweet (unlike this mini-series),"I will never watch another Spielberg movie again. This was the longest, most boring, and most cliched alien abduction feature EVER! Oh how I long for the days when ""V"" came out!If you want to see how a good sci-fi, abduction story is supposed to be told, watch ""4400"" when the next season comes out."
4,A magnum opus!,"Here is a story of such breadth and scope it is likely to disappoint some. Cheers still deserve to be awarded to this miniseries for attempting to encompass more than staid UFO abduction story drizzled with government conspiracies. Yes, both of these elements are included in the series, but when packaged with multigenerational character arcs, impressive special effects, and slight twists on the expected elements of alien stories, the result is a riveting story.Oh, and stay away from the novelization. It's juvenile and contrived."
2,"Starts strong, ends with a wimper","I watched the entire series on SciFi when it originally came on. It started very strongly with the WWII setting and on into the 50's. From there, however, it went downhill. I liked the early characters, and I liked the idea of tracing the families throughout the years. After the beginning, however, it went downhill. The later characters are not as sympathetic, and the ending is completely anti-climactical. Nothing is explained, and nothing is settled. Some may say that this is to provoke thought...I say it's bad story telling. I believe that the only reason that this series won awards is because of the name behind it. That, or a lack of competition in the mini series category."
2,Yawn. Is it Over Yet?,"Taken (aka T-person-ken) is a fairly lengthy sci-fi miniseries which originally aired on the Sci-Fi channel. Besides being about alien abduction, it carries the imprimatur of Stephen Spielberg! What could be better? Unfortunately, the series suffers from one fatal flaw: NOTHING EVER HAPPENS! Thats right, after dutifully punching in night after night, waiting for the good stuff to kick in, the series finally ends leaving the viewer with nothing but occasional glimpses of interesting alien stuff. On the upside, Matt Frewer is pretty good in this series. (Oh I just remembered, Matt Frewer's good performance was exactly cancelled out by the chick from ""The Blair Witch Project"", so never mind.)"
4,Taken by Thomas H. Cook,I have not watched the DVD version of this movie. I did; however watch the first half of a two part show on the Sci Fi chanel. I was truly upset to find out there was a second half and I didn't watch it. I am very interested in viewing the other half of the movie. It was just getting good.
1,boring peripheral drama overdose,"I love sci-fi and badly wanted to enjoy Taken but there is so much boring, unrelated drama that it's unbearable! People are loving it so maybe it was just me, BUT PLEASE TRY TO CATCH SOME ON TV BEFORE BUYING!!In addition, I must say that this mini-series is in many ways, an abomination. Spielberg, or whoever was spoonfeeding him, took legitimate stories from historical sources and twisted them into attributing all ufo's to aliens. ""Yes, everything is clear to me now- the government really IS trying to protect me from the terrible secret of space"". Too much propaganda and not enough storytelling/entertainment. I suspect this review will help 1 in 1 million."
5,"Best Mini-series since ""Lonesome Dove""!","Of course they are both two diffrent series,but it has been that long since I have been so invested in a tv mini-series.You can't go wrong with anything that Steven Spielberg does. I was sucked into the plot from the very begining.Loved how the story surrounds three families and follows into the present.The most fun I had was catching familer faces from ""X-Files"" episodes,quizzing myself from which episode and character name from the XF!Great ""new"" talent! Totally loved the little girl Allie(Dakota Fanning) such an amazing young Talent!A Must have for any sci-fi fan or UFO believer!"
5,"Seen ""Taken"" on the sci-fi channel","This movie was incredible ! It started of slow by setting a story and time line and introducing the charactor`s. It go`s thru the generation of the charactor`s and show`s how the alliens probed the humons thru the years. {Each night I had to watch to see what would happened.}As the story comes closer to the end, everything starts to come together. I hope that they come out with a sequal to this.They cannot let it end the way that they do.She must come back..... IT`S A MUST!!!"
3,CREEPY ALIEN SOAP OPERA,"With Steven Spielberg's name above the title, TAKEN (DreamWorks) the 10 part alien abduction epic that parallels mid to late 20th Century history, became a huge hit for the Sci-Fi channel.See what happens to three generations of American families who get involved with unearthly invaders with an agenda. This alien soap opera is clever, chilling and involving."
5,Best mini series ever,"I loved the movie and I liked the way they had it set up too. Each episode left you hanging with questions and ideas that you had to find the answers to, which brought you back each night. I couldn't wait for the next one. I just hope that they don't cut out anything when they put it into a movie. I want all of each episode to be in the DVD collection. They can either combine the show into a continuos multi-disk movie or leave it in the episode form, no matter how they do it I am definantly buying TAKEN"
5,Alternate Roswell Scenario,"Taken has been one of the most excellent epic series I have seen and it has kept me sitting down every single weekend just to watch what's going to happened next.The series itself kept us on the edge of the seats and Spielberg has obvious broken out from the circles of alien abduction cliche movies to a whole new level.The alternate version of what really happened in Roswell. The air whether balloon & the starship. An escaped alien meets a human female. The begining of crop circles era. The visitations and abductions by the aliens to the human kinds.The story of three different family who at the begining, do not have any connection to each other has their destiny entwined by an unexpected visitor in their lives and the story goes through the whole 3 generation that ends up with an unexpected end."
4,"Well done, but not for everyone","I enthusiastically enjoyed every moment I was able to watch the series, wondering at the sources for the content, and appreciative of the pains taken to make the presentation as realistic as possible.However, it is not the pure E N T E R T A I N M E N T that so many people are accustom to and need from TV. It's meant to be thought provoking and participatory.I knew I'd be buying a disc set before the end of the 1st episode. I bellieve it is a new watermark in SciFi history."
4,watched it multple times,"the only sink hole in the whole thing is when it shows that Lubbock, Texas has mountains in the background!!! That took a little credibility from this otherwise very entertaining DVD series. Maybe they will fix that in 10 or 15 years when the sequel is done!!! :D"
5,Taken,"I thought it would be just another story, full of special affects, hardly any plot and playing on the same old tired story lines other movies have used, but was I surprised. This is the first movie my wife wasn't able to pry me away from, and I know it's the first one she canceled all of her evening activities so she could watch too. I ordered the DVD's as soon as I saw the were for sale, and anxiously look forward to seeing them in their entirety without the commercial interruptions. I just hope my wife doesn't invite her noisey girl friends to watch it with us."
2,"Excellent show, but............. don't get this version.","I agree with the positive reviews on here. And I really believe it hits the nail right on the head. It's VERY well done, and the acting is nothing short of amazing. Each actor played his or her role to perfection. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it, even people who don't necessarily like sci-fi or don't believe in aliens. I've been waiting a long time for the prices to come down so I could finally own it. LOVE IT!!!UPDATE: I finally had the chance to sit down and watch all the episodes, and I'm disappointed to say that there are several very important scenes that have been cut out. I hate it when they do that to DVDs, because if you haven't seen it before, then there are parts that make no sense. maybe that's why some people have given this bad reviews. I wish I could have afforded the old DVDs when they first came out, because when I got those from the library, those scenes were in there. Bummer."
2,boring and pretentious,"As big fan of the space and alien genre, I eargerly awaited the telecast of the movie when it premiered on the SCI FI channel.I was disappointed. I think the screenwriters attempted to make the movie ""deep and complex."" There was too much ""drama"" and not enough time given to the actual interaction between the alien and his terrestial counterpart. However, if one enjoys deducting and comtemplating the ""message and cultural significance"" of movies,then this one is for you."
5,Blackbeard documentary,This documentary is the most historically accurate of any about Blackbeard. The starring actor is hands down the greatest pirate EVER! I'm so happy to own a copy. My order came quickly and is exactly as described. Excellent vendor. (Thanks!)
4,When Bad Things Happen to Good People,"In Perfect Light, Benjamin Alire Saenz. On the edge of US and Mexico sit El Paso and Juarez. Saenz considers this intersection as well as the intersections between the lives and deaths of people living there. Grace, the social worker with cancer, Mister (I never could figure out why anyone would name their child 'Mister' -- she did not otherwise seem like a weirdo) her son, who wants to adopt a child, Andres Segovia, the orphan in his twenties, and Dave Duncan, the criminal lawyer who wants to fix the world, are some of the characters put to the test. How they survive (or don't) and grow is the theme of this novel, which is well written but certainly not upbeat."
5,A very clear textbook,"This textbook is a shining example of what a textbook should be. It is very organized, connects ideas to show the big picture, breaks down topics into the clear, organized elements, provides examples, and is very clearly worded.My chosen field of study is unrelated to the class I used this book for, but I love it so much I'm going to keep it. If I ever have any questions along these lines in the future, I'll go to it."
3,not a very detailed book,"Bought this book for my math class Numerical Methods. Overall it's a good reference book. However, you might need to do some research on certain topics."
4,A Classic Fighting Manual!,"As opposed to the other reviewers, I believe that this is a manual worth having, if you have an interest in ""real"" self-defense. This manual is a classic, and it provides the reader with some insight into the tactics actually used during WWII to neutralize enemy soldiers during close combat. You won't find any fancy katas, or other martial arts routines but you will get solid tactics that worked in the past and are still relevant in the present.The title includes the complete hardcore calisthentic exercise routine, commonly refered to as ""combat conditioning"" as well as the basics of ""combat judo"", stick / baton tactics, knife tactics, and bayonet tactics. Hardcore students of CQC won't be disappointed."
3,Standard Military CQC,"This book is standard military CQC based largely on judo. It is a ""basic training"" type program. Good, if somewhat over simplified system of upperbody throws with some open hand blows included."
2,All things new are not always better.,Interesting to see how exercise has progressed over the years. Experienced exercisers can pick out things that still work today but why? Most of us still use what works! Neat old photos and great for the time period. We have moved on. Ed
3,good other than some background noise,the last 15 minutes had some serious background noise. However the picture was very good for vhsthats all I have too say other than it was a great movie I highly recomend.
2,Cheap product for good profit?,"It's obvious they've skimped on quality. Anything coaxial comes in with bad interference, RCA connectors are better but not by much. Whites run into blacks, picture overall is subpar.I actually returned the first (from the store) in hopes a second would work better, no such luck. I'm going to just toss the one I have and buy a decent selector.Note: I've only rated this as a two, because I reserve ""1"" for products that fail 80% of the time or above, or products that fail completely to deliver advertised functions."
1,Pathetic Piece of Trash!!!,This thing stinks. it makes the sound all bad and the colors mix. don't buy it.
4,"""Folk art"" toys from home","This is not truly folk art although it includes folk pieces and Victorian toys. The most amusing piece, in my mind, is the Alice in Wonderland chess set. Folk toys include the Hanoi Puzzle and Noughts and Crosses. Victorian toys include chromatrope, thaumatrope, acrobat, gymnast and clown. Christmas is represented by two jigsaw puzzles. There are play ""sets"" for Cinderella's coach, oil rig, riding school, service station, grocer's shop, and a castle.This book should be of interest to toy makers, those interested in folk toys, etc."
3,Maybe too ridiculously simple,"This book is good as a quick read and to cover the very basics of behavioral medicine. The chapters are short and to the point, and cover a range of topics. However, the information provided is at a very basic level, and may be more appropriate for pre-med than med school. Additionally, while the humor and silly examples used in the book may make it a more enjoyable read for those who are required to read it, or who do not have an interest in behavioral medicine, the style may serve to make light of an important and complex field that is, at times, undervalued."
3,Great for a taller vehicle,It's a little annoying that the only position that the pivoting brush head locks in to is the center position. If you are trying to sweep snow with it in the side position it has a tendency to move. Other than that it is a great brush. Very handy to have it telescope out so far. Makes clearing my truck off a lot easier.
5,A fantastic recording of virtually unknown works by Strauss.,"Thanks to this recording, several great unknown works by R. Strauss are finally available to the general public. I have no idea why these pieces are ignored in concert halls and recording studios. The Locke Brass Consort does a fantastic job with these very challenging works (I've played the Fanfare Fur Die Wiener Philharmoniker and the Johanniterordens and will personally attested to their difficulty!) I highly recommended addition to the Strauss lovers library."
5,document of Philippe Jaroussky,"It's worthwhile to buy this dvd - just because of the short aria of 'La Speranza' sung by the fantastic Philippe Jaroussky, one of the most beautiful voices of our time!"
5,truly lovely book,"My 18-month old son absolutely LOVES this story, and so do I. He was entranced by the story and the images from the very first time it was read to him. Even after many, many readings, he has not yet grown tired of it, either. In fact, I often hear him reciting phrases from this story at random times throughout the day! The story is very sweet, the rhymes are simple yet memorable (great for early learners) and the illustrations are beautiful. I suspect that this book probably has not gotten the exposure it deserves; it could otherwise easily be a classic."
5,librarian recommended,I have a very active toddler who likes to run away and not stay close. The librarian picked this book out to help me teach her a lesson about staying close to mama.
3,"He Gave Up A Lot Of Walks, But He Didn't Write ""Ball Four""","Just another baseball book, and despite Ryan's undisputed greatness as a pitcher, not a particularly memorable one. Ryan comes across in these pages as an engaging and appealing personality, but the book lacks any personal stamp. To say it's definitely not ""Ball Four"" may be unfair, since Ryan didn't intend to write that kind of tell-all book. But Bouton set a gold standard for memorable prose by a baseball player and Ryan just doesn't have Bouton's way with words. There are, however, a few entertaining stories about pitchers, such as this one about Don Drysdale: an umpire once ran his hands through Drysdale's hair, after members of the opposing team claimed he was putting Vaseline hair tonic on the ball. ""When my wife does that,"" Drysdale told the ump, ""she usually kisses me.""This book is only for hard-core baseball (and Nolan Ryan) fans."
4,asia's review,my girlfreind loved the idem but the shiping sucked other then that all things good. it is such a lovly charm braclet and looks good on any womans wrist.
1,Contains BPA!!,"This pump contains BPA and has been discontinued. There are plenty of other pumps that are not made with BPA. Evenflo (and other companies, too) is remaking everything BPA free, so look at others instead of this one!!!"
1,Bad product-terrible warranty,"Bought this for my wife in August. It worked ok for a few months and conked out in 6 months. The warranty is 90 days-in other words, don't expect it to work for much longer and sure enough, the motor dies in 6 months!!! A Medela might cost twice as much, but it has a better warranty and last longer-we have friends that have used Medela for over a year and a half without any issues. Save your money, spend more on a Medela!!!! Too bad I couldn't give it zero stars!!"
5,Perfect for everyday use,The first time I used this product I had given birth to my daughter the day before. I was plugged up and having a hard time trying to get my milk started. I pumped for 15 minutes and was able to breastfeed my daughter.I will be using this product full time when I go back to work in January. I am very thankful to have it.
3,Just a text book...,"Most of the work we've done so far has been class activities and group work so we really don't depend on the book that much. However, I have read some of the book and it has been extremely dry and ""academic"" in the way it approaches most of the issues. This book makes the whole subject so stiff and formal in many ways that it almost loses its usefulness. I'm very glad for a professor who likes to put it all into a practical light."
4,"Intriguing, but of Limited Lasting Value","This book offers an unorthodox account of three dimensional vector calculus which uses a host of nonstandard terminology. But while a student of vector calculus is likely to find some of the material in this book initially very helpful, they will quickly outgrow it.The author has a list of the limitations of this work near the end. Among them: good only for three dimensions, limited to flat spaces, and limited to definite metrics. But even the student who expects their work to be limited to three dimensional Euclidean space will find the approach of this book limited by its lack of coverage of dyadics.A stepping stone on the way to tensor calculus, and definitely not suitable as an introduction to vector calculus."
2,"Try ""Gravitation"" by Misner-Thorne-Wheeler instead","Very interesting stuff but there is little consideration, if any, on how to tie this rather unorthodox presentation with almost every and any other book in or out of print. In contrast, ""Gravitation"" by Misner-Thorne-Wheeler offers the same geometrical insights in a way that ties nicely with whatever else one is likely to read about tensors and differential forms (two concepts about which Weinreich is mysteriously silent). So if you own Misner-Thorne-Wheeler you do not need Weinreich, and if you don't then you should, in which case you'll avoid Weinreich and learn some relativity theory too. However, after you read Misner-Thorne-Wheeler you may want to check your understanding of some concepts by seeing if you can find their equivalents in Weinreich's idiosyncratic treatment."
3,NOTICE! Errata on previous review.,"I was wrong, wrong, Wrong to fault the first set of equations in this book. These equations are CORRECT -- they are the true determinants of the 3x3 matrix represented by the cross products AXB=C and DelXF, as given in the text.The remainder of the text, however, still remains with several errors. (For instance, the distance vector d goes from positive to negative, not as it is written ""...from negative to positive....""However, I am greatly relieved to be proven wrong about the equations. After all, I paid a lot of money for this book, and expect to see flawless analyses. If I have to end up correcting many parts of the book then who's teaching who, huh? I don't pay out good money just so I can end up teaching the teacher. Where's my salary, then, huh!"
5,"Invaluable -- Div, Grad Curl ++","I actually have a few complaints about this book, but the core material is so helpful and instructive that they don't much matter.This book explains vector and the beginnings of tensor analysis with new visual metaphors for vectors: lines, sheaves, thumbtacks, stacks. The dot and cross products can be visualized with these metaphors, and the various forms of Stokes/Gauss theorems proven visually.This is great stuff for anyone going beyond the basics in vector analysis -- which would be anyone in pure math or physics, and some engineers.You do need to use this as an adjuct to a conventional text or course.This is the more sophisticated and general version of ""Div, Grad, Curl and All That""."
1,"quality issues, front focusing problem","i got two lens before i gave up on this, both lens front focused. couldn't get it to focus on what i wanted it to."
4,LOVE this lens!,"This lens rarely leaves my camera. I love it. Period.If I HAD to complain about one thing it would be the AF speed. Very slow.I'm usually shooting in MF anyhow but when I need AF, it becomes unreliable for the most part.This lens would definitely be a re-purchase if I had to do it all over again. Images are fabulous and at f1.8 you'll find the light."
4,Great Lens,"Great lens with a semi wide field of view. The best feature is the 1.8 speed, which makes this a great low light lens."
2,"Eh, it's so, so","I wanted a macro lens that would also be good for portraits/snapshots and this just wasn't it for me. I found, as others have said, that this lens has issues with the autofocus and the shots I took just weren't that sharp, even at f/2.0 and above. I love the Olympus Zuiko 50mm Macro, but the focal length was just too high for what I want to use it for, but boy was it sharp! This lens is also VERY heavy, even heavier than the Zuiko 50mm macro. I would really love to see Olympus come out with a fast prime (think the Canon 50mm f/1.8), macro or not, for the E-Series cameras. I'll stick with my 14-54 f/2.8 for now!"
5,Amazing!,"I love this lens. The only time it comes off my D80 is when I need a zoom lens. Otherwise, this is a great almost all in one lens. It is a bit slow in the focusing department compared with my Nikon 18-135 but it is much sharper than all my othe lenses. Produces great bokeh at 1.8"
5,Peace in a world turned upside down,"These books have helped me handle Sep 11! I turn off the news and tune into Mitford. I am reading ""A New Song"" and hoping a new volume will be out soon! These books bring me sweet dreams."
5,How do I get to Mitford?,"I've read each of the Mitford books, and I can hardly wait for the next one! Jan Karon does a fantastic job of building her characters. You really feel like you get to know them. I typically read the fast-paced action books, but I could curl up with the Mitford books for hours and not get bored!"
5,If you haven't made it to Mitford yet ...,"you have a wonderful journey waiting. Like crawling inside a Thomas Kinkade painting, a way to renew faith (in all things) and spiritual journey, The Mitford Series is EXACTLY what we all need more of."
2,A Choppy Diary Reading,"I love the Mitford books, so I was looking forward to sharing them with my family on a recent car trip. What a dissappointment - the beautiful character build up is missing, and it reads more like a list of ""what I did today""."
5,my review,"After I started reading the first chapter of the first book in this series, I knew I was hooked. I could not put it down. You are immersed into the life of this little town, Mitford, and you follow the joys and anxieties of Father Tim while he is trying to tend to his parish!I have been looking in the bookstore for a whole year just waiting for volume 5 to come out!I have even though of starting to read the series again....."
5,At Home In Mitford,"I am an avid mystery fan, but somehow, a copy of ""At Home In Mitford"" miraculously appeared in my bookcase. I normally would look at this type of book and decide it wasn't for me, but something, perhaps the picture on the front cover, intrigued me and I started to read, fully expecting to be quickly bored. Instead, I found myself immersed in Mitford, its characters, and activities! I could hardly put it down! I love how Ms Karon weaves a magic spell of mystery and intrigue in every day activities...and especially how these are not far fetched and actually are believable! I love Father Tim. He is the epitomy of what all pastors should be and I can't wait to see if he and Cynthia marry! It's a great book and I'm sure the others in the series will be just as excellent!"
4,mixed reviews,"This is one time where the author reads her own books and it really works. Jan Karon was excellent. These came as cassettes, however, not the CD's I was anticipating. I have a cassette player, but this turned out to be very inconvenient and wasn't clear in the description of what I was buying. Who buys cassettes anymore? I also have read the books already and didn't like having the abbreviated version. That was clearly stated, however, so I went for it anyway because the price was right."
1,Not a good kids book,There are much better kids books out there than this one. The drawings are average and the story is below average. In fact it the lead character is feared by the other animals and never makes friends. Not a good message in this book.
4,Works OK,This is my second battery drill. I had a Craftsman before this and it was terrible so I was looking for something that would at least take a screw through a 2X4. So far this one has done the job. The only disappointment is the lack of accessories for the price. Overall I'm pleased.
3,Old Timey Readers,I bought these for my granddaughter because they were easy to read when she just started to learn how to read. I remembered these Dick and Jane adventures from when I was a little kid. They are fun for first time readers!
5,"Dick and Jane, Go away Spot.","My son read the books in series one and is now starting the series 2 books, he is doing very well with them. It is nice to see him after he finishes the book a real sense of accomplishment, drives him to the next book."
5,QUITE ENJOYABLE,"THE 2 SEPARATE MOVIES [SO FAR] BASED ON THE HIT TV SERIES HAVE REMAINED REMARKABLY TRUE TO THE SERIES WITH ALL THE EXCITEMENT, HUMOR,ETC. BRING ON #3"
2,Finding truth through logical fallacies,"The author is proud of his illiteracy. Really bad grammar, numerous logical fallacies, boring repetitions, no index, no references and plainly wrong facts.And I say this as a freethinker who agrees with the conclusions of the book. Readers interested in atheism and free thought would be better off reading books by George H Smith, Paul Kurtz, Bertrand Russell, Robert Ingersoll and many others.""The Cruelest Joke of All"" reminded me of Abd Ru Shin, a ""visionary"" whose rants and condescending tone make the reading of his works almost impossible. Max King is an atheist who prays that ""you will see the light of truth"". Need I say more ?"
2,"book falls short, so much better out there...","Max King's objective is to get people to think critically about Christianity. The book is short and the message consistent through, ""Use your head and think!"" He asks common sense questions but doesn't provide answers of any depth. The book is empty.His approach may be effective to some, but will fall short to the majority in search of some truth. Not recommended."
1,Not worth buying,"I'm an atheist, and this book almost made me a Christian again.Not really, but it's important to point out that Max King, a nom de plum, is not a very good word smith. The contents of this book could have been boiled down to a short essay, but instead he takes us through many many pages of repetitive nonsense.It's just poorly written, and the arguments he makes are done so in a manner that are not convincing.If you want a good book about atheism, read something by Richard Dawkins. It'll be a much richer experience."
2,Not great! but maybe I just didn't know what to expect,"I bought this with high hopes, and was let down. Basically it is like a rock, that you have to wet before you put it on. Then it still does not go on well, and doesn't really work well. Maybe a roll-on or powder version would be better. I work for Fedex, and I come home stinking with this on. Not so with the standard deoderants on the market."
4,Great Product!,"I began using this product when I was pregnant and could not tolerate the smell or feel of regular deodorants. I was very pleasantly surprised! Not only does it prevent odor (on all but maybe 110 degree days) but it does not irritate my sensitive skin, doesn't make my skin sticky, and does not ruin my clothing. It also lasts a really long time with proper use.Note: Make sure you don't drop the stick or run it under water. It will crack or crumble. It should be applied on still wet skin just after bathing. It can sting for a minute on cut or broken skin.I have continued using it after pregnancy because I liked it so much better than conventional deodorants!"
5,Crystal deodorant review,"My search is OVER! This product beat every single deodorant on the market today! Trust me, I have tried all of them! Crystal does NOT leave any trace of white on my black clothing and the odor stays away all day (even on those days when I would have found myself re-applying with others.) Get this deodorant, you will not be dissapointed one bit!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,just about okay.,"i did not expect too much extravagance with this toy.still was disappointed.the pose is great,can be used only as a show piece."
5,Superbly done,"I saw most of this excellent documentary on PBS, and ordered my own copy after it won an Emmy. It provides a splendid history lesson about a war that most of us know nothing about, in which the Soviet Union invaded Finland after the signing of the Hitler-Salin pact in 1939. The presentation moves smoothly between real historical footage, modern re-enactments, and excerpts from interviews. One of the many strengths of this film is that it allows viewers to draw their own conclusions about the underlying issues of war, peace, national prestige, and military preparedness. But I think the strongest praise I can give is that I happened to start the documentary with my 6th grade daughter and 8th grade son watching with me. About halfway through, I asked if they wanted to do something else while I finished. Each of them quickly said they wanted to see the rest. This would be a great film for schools to show."
5,Amazing,As a Finn now living in Canada this documentary made me feel proud of my birth country. My grandfather fought in the winter war and I remember the stories he would tell us.... Many of these stories came back to me watching this. Highly recommend to anyone interested in history of Finland !!!
5,Great Red,This book is really good for artists specifically for this era of new artists. It is invigorating and mind opening for success and worldview's on the American artist.
5,I love this strong but a little sweet mint,"I like the taste of this mint. It is stronger than many others. But it is not as strong as the starbucks mints. But, this is my own opinion, you know. My girlfriend and her sister do not like this as much as I do.I like the design of the case. It is also compact to put it in a pocket of your pants or a bag.It is sad that we cannot get this in kiosk or common stores."
3,Not Sure,Used this a few times and never really noticed a difference. Perhaps with much continued use I will get longer life out of the cutting boards?
3,Bamboo wood oil,There's not much to review. It works okay but for the price it was fine. I have applied it to a cutting board and it did the job. Nothing outstanding and that's why it got only three stars.
4,Works as Intended,Works as intended and applies very easily. I used it on my cutting board and utensil made of bamboo. Would recommend to anyone using bamboo products.
5,Bamboo Oil,I am very pleased with the bamboo oil. I use it about once a month on my bamboo cutting board.
4,PA Lab use,"Seems durable enough, serves the purpose for our H&P lab with our second year PA students! Wish there was a hole in it to hang on our cabinets, but price was absolutely right!"
3,too small,"good for smaller joints.. but not shoulder or knee...maybe for wrists...too big for fingers..bought it but didnt want to use it... but if you want portability, then you have to compromise with this i guess.."
4,Good bluesy sound,"Good growling bluesy sound, no clear tones though, even at low volume on a single coil guitar."
3,Previous filters were better,"The current Smokestop filter has significantly less carbon than it did 1-2 years ago so the filter is less effective at removing smells. It isn't a miracle product, but it does help with smells and I believe it does improve air in confined space."
1,poor airflow,"Ok, now it's time for a review NOT generated by BlueAir's PR agency (if the promotional language of the 5 star ratings wasn't obvious the first time, reread them). The Smokestop filter doesn't stop the smoke. It stops air flow, period. After inserting the filters, it astounded me to see the output of a 600 series purifier (apparently their best one) reduced to a trickle. Was any product testing done before these filters were dumped on the market? Customer service at Blueair proceeded to insult my intelligence by insisting that the unit was just as effective, despite the reduced airflow. I'd get more filtration from a leafy plant."
2,Poor Air Flow,"I inherited a Blue Air 503. A couple of months ago I decided to up-grade to Smokestop Filters and I have to say, I was very disappointed by how much airflow I lost with the addition of the active carbon in the filters. I would guess that my CADR was cut in half, if not more. On fan speeds 1, 2 and 3, I can't even hardly feel any air coming out at all. Only on fan speed 4 does it seem to be moving any air, but fan speed 4 is far too loud for me. The top filter that lies flat, doesn't seem to have any air coming out even at the highest fan speed. I feel like I wasted the extra $50 on the Smokestop Filters. I have just ordered a new set of Particle Filters and I will throw the Smokestop's away."
1,not what it claims to be,"I ordered this thinking it's a powder (because that's what the description says it is!). What I got instead was a ginseng root candy. Description is grossly inaccurate. The return is causing another set of problems, but I will leave that for the seller review."
4,Christmas present,I guess it was ok. I was hoping for more of a picture book so my grandchildren would have been a little more interested.
5,What a great idea,"My 6 year old grandson's words ""this book is awesome"" ! Was hesitant at first because he's all boy and wasn't sure of his response. So glad it found this book"
4,Great for kids!,"I bought this book for my nephew. It is glow in the dark, but it is also really informative. I would buy this again."
5,Glow in the Dark Constellations,I checked this book out from the library with my six year old son a few months ago. We kept re-checking it and re-checking it... when we took it camping with his dad and step-brother we decided that we needed to own it as it was the coolest addition to camping ever. Take a flashlight out and shine it on it and look up- easy peasy and fun. What a great idea and a great book. Easy to read and understand.
4,Did someone open a door?,"There are startling, powerful ideas revealed somewhat effortlessly, through this documentary. While the ideas may not be new to a very small fraction of the general public, the majority of us will be served well by such a compact introduction to gnosticism, and it's hidden role in our own history. Indeed, it is amazing how this history continues to struggle to make it's self heard.If anyone has ever taken an Eastern Religion class and wondered why our religion, Christianity, seems so blunt by comparison, the discovery of the Gnosticism will serve as a sort of missing link, to a story-chain that didn't quite add up.I have to concure with some of the earlier reviewers, National Geographic is a tad goofy in their production style, but they still have that great theme song! so I'm standing by them."
3,"Give it time, get to know it","William Alwyn's music is something of an enigma. When listening, it's always worth bearing in mind that he wrote a lot of film music. Wholly tonal, his music sounds like it ought to have been written a couple of generations before it was. But then there's always a tough edge near at hand. And when you have got used to that approach, there's a set of luscious chords that come straight out of popular song. For me, I can find the influence of Bax and Britten, but that is unfair. The composer had his own voice, and it's quite a complex, but rewarding one. This is music you need to get to know. It's not arresting, but the experience is wholly worthwhile."
1,Not Slippers!!!!,"These are the most uncomfortable ""slippers"" that I have ever worn. Sticky vinyl inside makes for sweaty uncomfy feet. They are also a bit slippery and I find myself sliding all over the place on our hard wood floors."
3,Great Author,I have just recently started reading Christian fiction books over fiction books and what a joy it is to find an author like Judy out there.The book has a few flaws not all small details are completed. What happened to the classes Jenny was taking?It was a slow read book for me not one I couldn't put down but maybe that made it all that much better that I got to saver it a little longer and the quotes that I have started in a notebook will forever be with me on this book. I look forward to reading the stories of the other BFF club.Read it you won't be sorry.
2,Ho-hum,"The plot has potential, but the writing is trite, and leaves me wanting. The author does too much telling and not enough showing."
1,time stands still,This is a good book BUT TO SIT FOR over an AN HOUR to watch this is asking too much... I had to ff much of the second half and if you have a somewhat interesting life ahead of you= YOU WILL ALSO KEEP YOU HAND ON THE FAST FORWARD!
1,Post-Apocalyptic Snoozer,"If you are an ardent fan of this genre, maybe you'll like it. There is nothing new or different or creative about this film from countless post-apocolypse movies that have gone before. I must confess I watched only the first half of this movie. I was falling asleep and couldn't take any more. It is drab and dull. The characters spend the daytimes wandering through abandoned buildings in a sort of gray, dismal twilight. They spend their evenings in firelight or near darkness engaged in endless, meaningless conversations. There is no action, no adventure, no story, no message, nothing to make this film intersting or entertaining."
1,Unbelievably unrealistic,"Bogus. The plot in this movie is totally unrealistic, and an unbelievable waste of the creative talents of Viggio Mortenson. In addition, in a post apocalyptic world, the weak would be the first to die, and the kid in that movie is not only weak, but can't even keeps it mouth shut. Even assuming that a kid like the one portrayed in the movie were protected (Impossible in the situation described!)in that type of world, anyone that went around crying, whining, and making noise all of the time like that stupid kid would never survive in a conventional war zone, let alone a post apocalyptic world."
2,Very Poor Story,The worst part of the story is leaving the bunker with all that food so you can sleep in the friggin rain...yea I would do that in a sec...wow!It not really worth the rent at all maybe $1 just to see if you personally like it but its really a terrible story.
3,OK but could of been shorter and longer in parts,"My friends read the book so we all watched the movie together and they said they thought the book was better. They also said that the boy in the movie was a little b**ch compared to the one in the book. The man was constantly carrying him everywhere. I mean come on. If I was dying a slow and painful death I wouldnt carry my 10 year old son everywhere. I mean the kid actually was really annoying. All he could say was ""papa' and ""ok"". Viggo did a great job. It was definitly a award deserving performance. Also they made Charlize Theron seem like a real jerk in the movie. Which sucks because I like her as an actor. After the movie we just sat their and discussed why people were missing their thumbs. That is what we came away with. If you read the book you sjould watch the movie. But personaly just go buy I AM LEGEND. It is a far better movie but again THE ROAD is ok."
2,Ugggggggghhh,"This film is beyond a doubt the most grim, bleak, and depressing movie I have ever seen. I am an avid fan of the post-apocalyptic genre, but this was far and away the most hopeless and gut-wrenching portrayal of any of them.During a flashback scene, a character commits suicide saying that 'she doesn't want to just survive' By the end of the film, the story has done nothing to make me believe she didn't have the right idea - that's how bleak this is.If you want a movie that makes you grateful for what you have (because things can be much, much worse), this is the movie for you. I'll give it that much."
5,GLORIOUS!,Amazing apocalyptic thriller from start to finish! The best apocalypse film EVER! Everyone in the cast hits a home run! Along with a very creepy atmosphere that will really make you feel that there's no hope and connect with the characters! TRULY AMAZING!
1,Very depressing! Extremely dissapointing!,Could not stand to watch the whole movie! It was sooo depressing! I like to watch movies for an escape from real life and my own problems! This movie will drive you to suicide!
1,I'm angry that I spent money on this,"I read the reviews, figured Viggo Mortensen and Robert Duvall are in it so how bad could it be? Really, really bad! I kept waiting for the story to do something and it never did. No, I didn't read the book and I never will. This is the most depressing, mindless, poor excuse for a movie that I've seen since ""In the Name of the King"". I think I'm going to go back to renting these things before I buy them. I now have a $20 drink coaster."
4,No country for man and boy,"I'm a fan of McCarthy's but I found the novel on which this film is based a little disappointing. For me, it was a tad too distant for it to fully work. And so this is one of those very rare occasions where, for me at least, the film surpasses the novel. It's bleak stuff for sure, and it won't be to everyone's taste, but as a study of humanity and parenthood under the most extreme conditions imaginable it's a powerful piece of cinema. There's no plot to speak of, but that doesn't matter. The film is about people not events: A father and son clinging onto each other and onto life, as they search for hope in a destroyed world. The performances are convincing as is the recreation of a post-apocalyptic world. It's difficult to describe such material as enjoyable, but it is certainly engrossing and thought-provoking."
5,GREAT MOVIE,Didn't know what to expect but was totally satisfied with this post-apocalyptic suspense ride. Would see over and over and highly recommend!
4,Not as good as the book,"I was hoping that this was be a good rendition of the book, but I was disappointed. Still worth the rental price."
2,Well Captured,Despite capturing the books grim nature the movie still felt hollow... Unless you specifically want to watch a redemptionless film there are other movies out there like; Book of Eli that are a far better watch.
4,The road,Great movie for a low price. But the case was a little flimsy but the disc was in tact all was good.
4,The Road,The Road - Followed book; good about dediction father to child. Also raised thoughts about what if. Acting by VM great.
2,Not a action movie,"I thought this movie was good when I watched the 2 minute preview using my Roku box but that was very misleading. The movie is very long and depressing and I never could follow the plot. All I could figure out was a family where the wife died and the father and son tries to stay alive and that's about it. They run into some weird people but that's about it. No gory stuff, walking dead or anything like that. Maybe the book fills in parts that are needed to understand it.If you are looking for a action movie this isn't it."
1,The Road,"Cant say anything about the movie really, what I got to see was pretty good. I have satellite internet and I was not impressed in the manner in which amazon downloads the movies, small bits at a time. their signal kept getting lost, even though my satellite was fine, not sure what the problem was, but I really dont care to watch a movie in 15 minute intervals-download the whole freaking movie geeeez-doubt I ever use amazon video again, was terrible."
2,"Overly long, dull, and overrated","It's overly long, dull, depressing, and ultimately, nothing much happens. The story could have been told in less than an hour. I realize it's got great reviews (highly overrated, imo), but I wasn't impressed. :-\Don't get me wrong - the acting was superb and the concept is sobering and touching. But it's just too blah and long overall ... to the point that by the end I was glad the darn thing was over and more than a little annoyed that it took so long to get there!What a waste of nearly two hours."
1,A How Not To Behave In A Doomsday Scenario.,"A worthless wife and mother who gives up on life when the hard times come...and adds the finishing touch of the cowardly--suicide.A weak maudlin husband and father who has nothing to teach to his son.A weak wimpy and worthless son--an albatross around his father's neck.I stopped watching after he tells his son to pray to the people who stored up the food they foundin some underground bunker or basement instead of praying and thanking God.I then I threw the base movie away.I don't recommend this doomsday, give-up, flick to anyone--you might as well watch ""Leaving Las Vegas."" Even that hopeless movie has more hope than this one."
1,Worst movie ever made!,I saw this movie in the theater and I should have walked out 15 minutes in. I kept thinking it has to get better right? Yea it didn't. It was horrible! Worst movie ever made! Do not buy this movie. I give this a zero star rating!
1,Bad choice,"First off it took like forever to receive the movie. If this is all the faster Amazon can deliver movies, next time I'll got to town and buy it. Secondly, the Blue ray won't play in either Blue Ray player. I've tried every adjustment there and it will not work. I'm not spending more money to send it back only to wait to get another. If there had been a no star rating I would of chose that one as it doesn't even deserve one star. What a circus."
5,An emotional masterpiece,"I'll not go into the details that other reviewers on this site have written about this film. ""The Road"" is an emotional cinematic masterpiece. As far as a film adaptation of a powerful book, it is equaled only by John Boorman's 1972 classic ""Deliverance"". When my wife and I finished watching this wrenching movie we tearfully called up our 26 year old daughter, who lives on her own , and asked her over to our house so that we could put our arms around her, kiss her, and tell her that we love her. Why this film was not nominated for an Academy Award as ""Best Picture"" is a total mystery to me."
2,Clueless,"I love a good suspense movie but ""The Road,"" had no actual plot, the father goes to what ever extreme to keep his son alive but there is no story line to maintain someones interest in the movie. I was very disappointed in it."
1,No More Videos,"After receiving two of these Blue-ray discs back to back and both defective, I won't be buying any videos from Amazon again. It's happened to me before and I know it can happen regardless of where you buy them but it's not the worth the headache you have to go through dealing with Amazon. They where cool with the replacing the original and finally giving me a refund after the second one pulled up lame but I'm still out $2 because I had to buy packaging to ship the original back to Amazon. That's a net loss of 20% overall. On top of that, I came across the same disc in a local ""big box' discount retailer for less. In the long run I guess it doesn't pay to make these low cost purchases from Amazon."
5,Another Great Existential Movie:,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. But I also really liked ""No Country For Old Men"" (another movie based on the author of the book off of which this movie was based). If you didn't like ""No Country,"" you probably won't like this. It's definitely not all rainbows and warm fuzzies - but then, it IS a post-apocalyptic world."
4,What Would You Be Willing To Do For Your Son?,"This movie is based on a very good book. The movie does a good, but not great job of capturing the spirit of the book. McCarthy's book is well written and gripping. The book, however, is not able to catch the velvety texture of the book because it simply a three dimensional representation of the book. That said, the movie does offer a great representation of a very important question. The question is: ""What would you be willing to do for your soon?"" Would you be willing to kill your soon to prevent him from being cannibalized and eaten? Maybe not, but the main character in this movie is forced to consider that very question throughout the entire movie. In the process, we are offered a seat from which to watch while he wrestles with this decision. Get this movie and watch the painful decision he must confront, and be thankful you will never be faced with such a decision."
1,Depressing annoying and irrational,This movie was slow and at times boring. The little boy whined the whole time. I do not recommend this movie. It lacks inspiration and some parts where purely annoying. I don't see how they survived for so long they didn't even have a knife!
2,People praise this movie? Really?,"What a disappointment. Viggo is an amazing actor in everything he does, but unfortunately even he couldnt pull this movie out of the muck. The movie left me with many questions. How did they survive? Where are they going? Why would they leave a super stockpile of supplies behind? Why did that kid have to be so repetitive and annoying ;(Papa, papa?, are we still the good guys?). You would think that he would have had a much better vocabulary for a kid of atleast 12, and be much less of a sissy boy. Where are the books? Why arent they evolving? We must have fast-forwarded over an an hour of the movie, and still wanted our time back for the bit we did see."
1,dreary crap,"I am a big fan of apocalyptic stories and movies and I must sadly report that this one is not worth the time. There is no clue as to what disaster has befallen the protagonists. There is no semblance of survival beyond walking to the coast in hopes that the ocean is ""still blue"" (like on the map) and avoiding cannibals. The only color you will see in this bleak tale is the bloody chopping blocks of what is presumably a cannibal's kitchen. I found myself wishing it would end after about the first five minutes."
4,review of the Road,"It was a good movie, very touching. But is also is a very dark movie.so if anyone is wanting to watch a comedy or a gemiciky syfy movie, you will not fine it here. Most people will shed a tear."
2,"It was Ok, but not really worth the time","I watched it on a reference from a friend, but when I got to the end, it really wasn't worth the wait. Kind of an interesting story, but it seems to just drag on and on feeling quite apocalyptically drab the whole time."
3,interesting movie,"quality of video for streaming was excellent. movie was slow. saw book of eli and really liked it, was hoping this would be similar but it wasnt."
5,What a movie,"As someone who has read the book and seen the movie I can say that this film is quite faithful to its source material. The book is quite an emotional journey as is the film, and let me just say that if you're expecting lots of action and adventure then you will be dissapointed, you should probably see The Book of Eli then, as that is a much more action oriented film and comperable as it has the same theme of the end of the world."
1,Triple-Prozac rating,"This is the most depressing movie I have ever watched. 5 minutes into it I felt like I wanted to kill myself and from there on it only got worse. What is the point of making such a movie? Why did I keep watching it to the end? Like there isn't enough to be depressed about anyway? I'm very fragile, family members always hide away the knives in the house from me and I still have nightmares a week later. There are ratings about every kind of content. There should be some Triple-Prozac rating for a movie like this to warn the public about its dangerously depressing effect. Ugh, Ugh, UGHGHGHGH..."
3,Boring,"The premise of this film was interesting, but it never really went anywhere. The pace was incredibly slow. It seemed to want to build some level of empathy with the characters, sympathy for their experiences. In the end, it only dulled what could have been an original and compelling plot. The overprotective stance of ""Man"" grew as stale as ""Boy's"" inability to mature and step up into his own power. This film may be a curiosity for die hard Mortensen fans, but it wasn't anything special."
3,"Very good acting, lackluster film","Mortenson's acting was superb, but you can only do so much with a faulty screenplay. Key plot events needed to make the movie moving and memorable were either entirely missing or glossed over so much they might have well been left out. The film just plodded along and the little memorable highlights from the book weren't there to enrich the sad, dark tale. The son was ANNOYING as heck, give him a slap."
3,Poor translation,"I'm not a big fan of Viggo Mortensen and I think the boy was horribly miscast. The ending lacked nearly all of the punch of the book. Oddly, the entire movie seemed too well lit, not at all what I was expecting from a novel with a pitch black cover."
1,Very disturbing movie,"I couldn't sleep that night after watching this movie. The cannabalism disturbed me so much, especially because it dealt with a child. Terrible terrible terrible. I wish I'd never watched it."
3,I love post apocalyptic movies but....,The movie was moving along nicely and very realistic but he just dies at the end.......... lame. Still ok though
2,Disappointing,I was hoping for more. This movie was quite uneventful. It is just about a son and father traveling in the post-apocalypse. There are maybe two exciting parts.
2,"Good seller, bad movie","After seeing this received an A on yahoo reviews, I was sure I was ordering a good movie. However, it was not to my liking. It wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen, but it certainly wasn't the best."
2,Lot's of info missing.,"The movie would have been much better if they would have actually gave you a story line or tell what had happened. They didn't really tell you anything. Charlize Theron was in the movie for maybe a total of ten minutes and they never said what happened to her or why she apparently went crazy. Viggo Mortensen is a very good actor, I assumed that he died of some sort of aftermath of an N.B.C. attack. I believe that the situation's and people that he and the boy encountered would be realistic. But that's the only part I could actually give the movie credit for. I feel they could have done much more."
3,"Not a ray of sunshine, or hope","I have to admit, after reading Cormac McCarthy's novel, I was curious about how they could make a movie out of it. The book had very little dialog, the characters were never really developed, and no questions in regard to how their situation came about were addressed. In effect it was a tale of a father and son surviving. Period. There were no extended plans for a better life, just survival one day at a time. I found it to be dreary, depressing, and largely without a coherent direction. The movie does a decent job of bringing the bleak hopelessness of the novel to the screen, and maybe a better job of forming an attachment to the characters, but overall I found the same lack of hope and direction. I found the story to be a good intellectual exercise, but as entertainment I can certainly understand why the movie didnt fare well."
2,Another doom and gloom movie.,"If you plan on buying or renting this you may want to skip my review as I may spoil some of it for you. The film was well made the cast was outstanding. The scenes were unbelievable but that is where it ends. I watched the whole DVD and was left wanting something more. I did not read the book and probably will not and it may have lost something in the book to movie translation. If you like happy endings this is not your movie. That may be why I didn't like it and do no recommend it. I wanted a happier ending. I wanted and end! I know full well that not every story has a happy ending. But even in movies as depressing as ""Schindler's List"" you got to see the good as well as the bad. Also it doesn't really end which I hate and you never know what caused all of that. That frustrates someone like me just like at the end of ""Ronin"" I wanted to know what was in that damn case."
5,THE HARD TRUTH,"sometimes folks can't handle reality, whether it scares em or makes them feel like they're not in control, i'm not sure, but The Road nails it on the head! a grim and realistic look at a post apocalyptic future, is what you get here, and it's hard, gritty and entertains, highly recommend!"
2,Just like the book,"The movie is faithful to the book, which is a real shame because the book was overlong and tedious. The book should have been a short story and this film need not have been made.For those who think this movie is great because it gives us a more realistic take on the apocalypse than all those silly Hollywood blockbusters, all I have to say is ""who cares?"" I mean do we really not know that this is what it would really be like? Yes, it would be hard and depressing. Do we really need a novel or a full-length movie to tell us that?"
5,The book or the movie first?,"I saw this when it first came out on DVD. I was blown away. The entire film leaves you with a strong sense of hopelessness and despair. But after it's over it leaves you feeling...I dunno. Hard to explain. Not ""YAAAAY!!"", Not ""WTF?!"", not ""Meh..."", not ""I'll never watch *that* again"". But also not overly jubilant, either. It just...is. I just finished reading the book tonight and was amazed at how well the movie followed the story. Events, dialog, everything. Which is a rarity for a movie based on a book.I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in drama, suspense, post-apocalyptic subjects, but also to anyone just interested in humanity as a whole."
3,Not as good as I thought it would be,"I was disappointed in this movie. Did not live up to the hype from online reviews. Its a rental. The Book of Eli was a much, much better movie along the same lines as this post apocalyptic movie."
3,read the book first,"The book was better as usual, although it wasn't too dissappointing. The actors did a marvelous job with a very depressing story that has absolutely no hope. I did like it better when I was reading it and had the visualizations in my mind of what actually was going on."
3,Inspiring!!!,This is an incredible story. It's the story of a man struggling to keep his son safe in a world where no one really is. I'm a huge Viggo fan. A History of Violence is one of my favorite films of all time. Once again he shows off his true depth as an actor. He delivers a performance that will not be soon forgotten. This is not one of those movies that you forget about 5 minutes after watching. This is the type of movie that stays with you. I only wish that i could have seen more of Charlize Theron. She was the main reason i decided to watch this. We only get to see her during flashbacks. She still does alot with the small amount of screen time she is given. This movie will be a permanent staple in my dvd collection and it should be in yours. I give this one TWO INSPIRATIONAL THUMBS UP! Holla
2,Depressing,Movie moves from one depressing scene to another. Not much character development. The scenes were choppy like the camera guy was actually there but had to run before he finished filming the scene because he thought they were going to eat him. T he book was better.
5,The Road with Viggo Mortensen,"Saw this before, read the book by Cormac McCarthy, and just had to own it.....it really follows the book amazingly, and the acting was excellent! Can't even imagine our world ever ending up like this.....scary, but portrayed in a very real way.....totally believable! Loved it, and so would anyone who loves a good book or movie!"
2,A Waste of Good Cinematography,"I'd heard that this was an awesome movie, so I sat back and gave it time to become awesome. And more time. And more. In fact, I kept hoping right up until the end that it would become awesome. Sadly, it never did.This is a (depressingly) beautiful film, despite its largely grey palette. The actors gave creditable performances, especially Viggo Mortensen, whom I've not been this impressed with in any other film. The pervading sense of horror is well done.But the plot/theme--like the whole trip to the coast itself--goes absolutely nowhere. There isn't even a thematically useful sense of despair upon their arrival at...just more of the same. The uncertain deus-ex-machina ending, while *marginally* believable, also seems only marginally related, thematically, to the rest of the story. I get the sense that maybe somehow it was all *supposed* to click. But it didn't."
3,Read the Book,"This is a tough movie to review. The book by Cormac McCarthy is a modern masterpiece, and I believe, fully deserved the Pulitzer Prize which it won. Part of the beauty of the book is its intimacy, the sense that you are there with these two people at the end of the world. The movie is well acted, well written, and faithfully recreates the events described in the book, but was unable to adequately convey this sense of ""being there."" The film makers really faced an impossible task, as the source material is so difficult to translate into film. I was also surprised they did not incorporate the beautiful, enigmatic, passage about the trout which ends the book, and which obliquely conveys the sense of things lost. Anyway, the film was a valiant effort, but I think, somehow missed the mark."
2,Disappointing,"I'll keep it simple: I didn't like it. Due either to the printing or the original photogaphs, the quality of the images was terrible. The content was boring and unprofessional. The only bright side is that I only paid a couple bucks for a used copy."
1,Hot Gel Dispenser,"Does not heat up well at allShould be called a ""cold gel"" dispenserIf you are looking for real heat fill up your sink with hot water and just use soap!Pretty lame."
3,its better than cold shaving creme,if you dont like cold shaving cremethis is the trick for ~$10if its more than $10get a bucket of warm water and soak your can firstHappy shaving!
2,"""Hot"" is definitely a misnomer","I agree with the other reviews stating that this machine puts out barely warm gel on its hotest setting. It replaced a Conair cream/gel dispenser that had develped a leak. The temp of the gel with this machine doesn't even approach that which it replaced. Not only that, but the ""oriface"" is very narrow requiring me to stand with my finger camped on the button for several mintues to get enough gel to be useful. Overall a relatively poor design."
3,bought for my husband,I bought this item for my husband to replace a diffrent model he had but after 7 years stopped warming. This model only slightly warms and he doesnt like it very much
4,Nice Shave!,"I recently started shaving my head. By the time you dry off from the shower and get ready to shave your head and face, your hair and skin has cooled off and gets harder to shave. This product has help a lot with that. It takes less than a minute to heat up. The only thing you'd want to watch out for is there is normally some pressure built up. If you don't hold a hand in front of it a glob of gel will shoot across your bathroom."
3,Warm Gel Dispenser,"A cool little item. Heats up the gel to just warm. Certainly better than the can. But if you're looking for anything like barber hot, this is not close. So, just a heads up. Not expensive, better than nothing."
3,"Try ""Warm Gel Dispenser""","For those of you who remember the Hot Lather Machines and Caps they had in the late 70's (as I do), this will be a tremendous disappointment. The old ones actually got the lather (no gel back then) hot, almost too hot to handle. Apparently this was a liability problem (as everything is in modern America) so now we have the dumbed-down version (as everything is in modern America). Temperature has gone from piping hot (close to hot water temps) to slightly warmer than body temperature. There is an adjustment on this dispenser, but ""wide open"" is only warm. Turn the dial and it goes down to useless. If there is any way to ""hotwire"" this thing to 70's level, I'd love to know about it. Until then, I'm afraid I can't recommend it unless you regularly shave in a cold bathroom."
2,Not worth it.....,"I purchased this heater because I have never been able to get a truly close shave. I usually get skin irritation regardless of the type of shaver I use or the type of gel I use. So during a beer conversation with a few of my friends, the topic of heating the shaving gel in order to get a closer and smoother shave was talked about and this particular product was mentioned and dissected. I was excited to try this product in order to get a close comfortable shave every time any time. But alas, that was not the case. From the get go I realized this product was cheap and did not do the one thing it was created for: get the shaving gel hot. I tried every setting and the gel would not get hot or even warm. This was a waste of time and money. I am better off keeping the saving gel in hot water for a few minutes and warming it that way. I do not think I will buy another gel warmer, and if I do, I will buy in store so that way I can return it when it doesn't work. Try at your own risk."
2,slow 'n' boring,"This would be a good video for beginners or senior citizens. That is if they can stand listening to about 5 annoying phrases she repeats over and over and over throughout the video. Pretty slow and boring........a very low budget video.I bought it because I wanted a weight training video,sorry........I didn't like it much"
2,Not so hot,"I have tried many of the recipes in this book, and the vast majority of them have been in the range of mediocre to downright awful. The entrees and sauces I've tried were bland. The chocolate cake, chocolate chip cookies, and pancakes were OK, but I've made MUCH better versions using recipes from other sources. The vanilla cake and tofu whipped cream recipes were dreadful, and the soy milk whipped cream and vegan mayo turned out runny and yucky. The recipes are generally easy to make, but many of the them call for ingredients that are harder to find or too expensive for a poor college student like myself (vegan parmesan cheese, etc.). The only recipe that was really great was the chocolate pudding, which was delicious. Still, I can't help but wonder why so many people recommend this book."
5,Love Sarah Kramer,"I am in cooking love with Sara Kramer's recipe books, online store and blog. She makes being a vegan ""cool"". I started with How it all Vegan and The Garden of Vegan. My brother and sister-in-law visited last year and had to have the books to, so I sent them home with them only to find that I couldn't live without the recipes myself. So, here I am ordering my second personal copy of each. Side note: my 10 year old daughter doesn't care that much for my husband's and my vegan lifestyle, but she will eat ANYTHING from Sarah Kramer's cookbooks because she is sooooo cool ;-)!!!"
3,Aren't bees animals too?,"This book has some great recipes that are not overly concerned with fat content but taste (AND the recipes are still healthy). There are even some tofu recipes that actually made me like the stuff. But, gosh darn it, in the intro they say they made the decision to eat bee products because it's just so important for health; give me a break! Go eat some nutritional yeast! And watch a show about how bees live and work. Please don't advise people to eat bee products when you say you're vegan."
2,Not so great...,"I've used a lot of the recipes in this book, and I've come to the conclusion that it's not that great. I followed everything to exact specifications, so has my girlfriend, and there's always a problem with it. The breads come out too hard or flaky, the chili is REALLY bland (I ended up adding my own ingredients and cooking it much, much longer than instructed, and it came out great) the ""easy breezy cheese sauce"" is nasty, the pancakes aren't that good, the sauces/dressings aren't good. The only thing I actually think came out good is the whip cream.I've gone online and found much better recipes for free. So, there's really no reason to buy this book, unless you need some ideas or reference to create your own meals."
2,"Good recipes, needs an index","A good selection of recipes that generally work. I rated the book a 2 because it does not have an index (now, I'm sure there was a recipe for Stuffed Red Peppers but where is it?) and because the baking recipes do not indicate size of pan (is a ""lightly oiled cake pan an 8"", a 9"", or a 13 x 9"" pan?). The appendix has a wonderful chart of ingredients that contain animal products."
1,So HARD to reference!,"I love cookbooks. I use them all the time. My major gripe with this book (and its sucessor) is the fact that there is NO index! The recipes aren't even indexed on a main front page! How do you say ""I want to make that cool blueberry muffin recipe"" without going through half of the book looking for it?I never use these 2. Ever. They could have excellent recipes, but I can't find them in a reasonable amount of time. I just can't get my thumbs around them when I'm ready to cook. Very bad UI design."
3,For Beginner Vegans,"Many years ago, when I first became vegan and there were hardly any cookbooks out there for us, I thought this book was the best thing since sliced bread. Now, almost a decade later I rarely, if ever crack the cover. Don't get me wrong, I am glad I own it, but it is for beginner cooks, and beginner vegans (as is the entire 3 book series)."
3,Not as good as La Dolce Vegan,"I was disappointed but I was likely comparing it to La Dolce Vegan by Sarah Kramer without a co-author. She does have alot of other folks recipes in La Dolce including someone named Wolfie who really has great recipes. Anyway, I will likely not use this book as much as I do La Dolce Vegan. You decide."
3,A five star book,"but I have to take points off. As other reviewers have noted, this book is not vegan. As of the fourth printing, I've seen at least one recipe that contains honey (on pg. 93). The index of animal ingredients claims that ""some vegans choose to eat honey,"" and this is obviously wrong. Vegans do not eat honey. A vegetarian might, but vegans do not. Vegans do not consume any animal products and contrary to popular belief, bees are animals. This is like saying some vegans drink milk. We don't.Other than that, this is a really cute book and I like it. I don't recommend you give it to anyone without mentioning the honey though. I know I wouldn't want someone accidently giving me something with honey in it thinking it was vegan."
1,Not that great....,This is one of the first books I bought about Vegan Cooking. I like that the authors are local but I have to admit that the recipes were boring and bland. Sorry! Try the Vegetarian Manifesto by Jay Fothergill!!! It's the best!! Simple and tasty!
5,BUY THIS BOOK!,"This is a very useful cookbook filled with ""normal"" recipes. The dishes are easy to prepare, and the ingredients are not unusual. (When unusual ingredients are listed, alternatives are offered.) There is a wide variety of recipes, and all that I've tried have been quite good. I highly recommend this book and Jannequin Bennett's VERY VEGETARIAN."
5,Made veganism an easy transition!,"This book is fun and funky. The recipes are easy and delicious, with little in the way of ingredients the common person hasn't heard of (and most of those are differences in Canadian vs. American lingo). This book does have a lot of desert and 'junk' food, yet it makes the transition easier. And quite frankly, most vegan books don't have recipes for chocolate chip bars and rice crispy treats, let alone ones that you can eat guilt free. The gals say to use whatever kind of flour and sweetener you like, so even junk food can be very healthy, depending on how you make it. My kids (8, 9, and 14) converted to veganism without fuss thanks to the recipes in How it all Vegan, Garden of Vegan, and Vegan Planet. BUY THESE BOOKS! Also read anything by John Robbins- it'll keep you vegan when you are tempted to eat a big slice of cheesy pizza."
5,"Fabulous book, very comprehensive!","I keep telling my boyfriend how much I love this cookbook (he's vegan too) just because I can't believe how great it truly is! It's perfect for both newly converted vegans and folks who have been vegan for years. I appreciate the breadth of recipes which other vegan cookbooks don't seem to cover as well (especially condiments, sauces, drinks, and non-dairy milks). Also, the information on kid's stuff, dog and cat treats, household products and health/beauty ideas are indispensible. Best of all, the recipes in How It All Vegan do not use exotic, hard to find ingredients. The authors show a great deal of creativity, humor and knowledge about food throughout the book. This book is great for everybody who loves food and cares about the environment! I highly recommend it!"
2,Ehhhh..,While this is a pretty neat cook book.. I was some what disappointed at how unhealthy the recipes were. I was trying to find something moderately healthy one night and ended up putting this book down. While it's fun to make some comfort food every now and then...I feel like one of the main reasons of being vegan (health concerns) is somewhat lost in this book. I would suggest so many other books over this one.
3,Reasonably Good Vegan Cookbook,"So I said in the title that this cookbook is reasonably good, and I think that pretty much sums it up. The recipes are not out-of-this-world in creativity or style, but they are pretty consistently good. My favorites include the shephard's pie, tortilla chip soup, and chocolate pudding cake. I would say this is a decent cookbook to turn to for vegan classics, but it's not going to knock your socks off with its innovative flavors. The recipes are reasonably straightforward and not overly time-consuming. They also do not require massive lists of specialty ingredients. I wish that the entree section were a little thicker; the cookbook is a little heavy on desserts and sides. It is a nice supplement to a vegan chef's library, but it would not be the first cookbook that I recommend you purchase (for that check outVeganomicon: The Ultimate Vegan Cookbook)."
5,One of the best vegan cook books ever,"Even though I am in England, and I don't have access to all the ingredients mentioned, the recipes are so well written, and so accessible that I simply can't recommend it enough. In particular the healthy, tasty food for kids is outstanding. Smoothies, and icecreams, which are full of vitamins (instead of e-numbers) and vegan meals which tempt meat eaters to veg out! We do food fairs and give out lots of free food to promote veganism - these recipes go down a treat with all and sundry. Now I hear they have done another book. Halleluia! I know I will be buying that one."
5,Essential for those on the go...,I am a college student and have 2 part time jobs...obviously on the go quite a bit. I found it difficult to find a vegan cookbook with delicious nutrient rich meals that were also creative and time sensitive. Most of the recipes are simple and contain few ingredients that I don't already keep on hand. Now I don't have to worry if I have enough time to cook a decent lunch or dinner without skimping on essential nutrients vitamins and minerals. This book got my creative impromptu juices flowing in discovering that there is more to a vegan diet than steamed veggies over rice!
5,Great stuff,"This stuff is getting hard to find ,so ordered this gallon came perfect and fast was well packed no leaks but that depends how it is handled by the carrier."
4,This Stuff Works,"All you need to do is open up the window(s) and spray. If it does remove the mildew the first time, spray the area again. No need to rinse or wipe the area down (if you do, wear rubber gloves)."
2,Bottle had been open and spilled out in the packaging. Seller contacted. No result.,"My wife loves this product and when she was unable to find it in the stores, I went online. What we got was a bit of a mess. It didn't have a seal on the gallon jug but was taped and bubble wrapped to try to keep it from leaking out from the cap. Big mistake.I contacted the seller and they did reply, but nothing was ever really done. My wife is able to use what we have although I wonder about its purity having been opened. Could be a watered down product, and it could also be fine. I just don't know."
5,Great!!!!,"I love this stuff and can't always find it at my stores. The gallon size is great as a re-fill, so I won't have to re-order as often."
5,Aaaamazing product!,"Unbelievable product. Destroys mold in minutes with barely any effort where nothing else would work on my tile shower. It's been over a month since I used it for the first time and mold hasn't come back - somehow penetrates caulk too. A truly remarkable product - the odor / fumes are intense though so open a window, wear a mask, get out quickly, or perhaps don't pull the trigger like al Pacino in scarface like I did :)"
5,IT'S ABOUT TIME,"IT'S ABOUT TIME SOMEONE GAVE ME A REASON TO LISTEN TO HIP-HOP! THIS GROUP HAS FINALLY DONE IT, OTHERS HAVE TRIED BUT HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESFUL."
2,repetitive and incoherent,"The author keeps repeating herself, drift to people stories and does not focus on the point in hand. It is easy to get lost and don't know what she trying to say."
1,No help at all,"This book does not seek to answer any questions because as far as the author is concerned she has all of the answers. Her agenda quickly becomes clear in the first chapter, and while she is entitled to her opinion, she should not misrepresent it as unbiased source of information. Additionally, I have never found a piece of writing more insensitive and plainly cruel to those of us who are reproductively challenged. Consequently, not only did the book not answer any of my questions or address my doubts, far from helping reach a resolution, it only kicked me while I was already down. I don't recommend this title to anyone facing fertility issues."
4,Changing Faces-That Other Woman,i liked this CD....i had to write a review on it for extra credit for a class at school and i came here to the site to see if there were any sample reviews but no luck....so i just thought i would write one here while i was at it....when i first seen the title i didnt think i had ever heard of it before but now that i listened to it i have heard it numerous times on the radio....it is a good song and i like the way they did the 6 different mixes of the song....it gives people who dont like rap a chance to listen to it another way....like edited or whatever their choice may be....overall this was a great CD
1,Dogged Read,"MS. Cleary began the Jackie and Jake series with a warm feel for Jackie's character and her abilities to deal with her trials and tribulations. She,also,was able to reasonably convey Jake's character as an adopted canine family member. However,as the series has progressed,it has been more and more difficult to concentrate on the author's marvelous plots as Jake's character has become more and more ridiculous. It has always seemed that Ms. Cleary's knowledge of dog behavior was somewhat limited but Jake has become a comic book character that even a non-doglover would have a hard time believing. This novel had great potential as a good mystery but the distraction of Jake's ludicrous behavior made it a labor to read. Perhaps it's time for MS. Cleary and Jackie to put Jake and Maury up for adoption. Her mysteries are no longer ""dog lover's mysteries""."
5,Great guidebook!,We're planning a family reunion with people expected from all age groups.This is an excellent guide for having an informative and fun-filled event. Thanks!
5,Great music book!,The music book I ordered was just right. It was in great condition and arrived quickly --all at a great price.
3,"Good coverage, many errors","I used this book as the text in a Maple class that I taught during the January term of 2006. While I found the coverage and exposition more than satisfactory, there are a large number of errors that made it difficult for the students. In their evaluations, they were happy with the level of difficulty and the amount of work, thought they learned a lot but every student complained about the number of errors in the book. What disturbed them the most was the fact that many of the errors were in the code examples, so when they tried to run them, all they got were error messages.This made my job more difficult, as it forced me to run all the code examples before class to make sure that they would be able to do the assignments. Many times, I had to consult the online Maple help in order to determine where the errors were in the coded examples. Therefore, I give this book five stars for coverage and level of difficulty and less than two stars for accuracy."
4,A Really Fast Way to Ascend the Maple Learning Curve,I'm new to Maple and wanted some help learning touse version 12. This book does the job.The most useful feature of the book (written for version 9)is the cdrom which contains maple workspace files forall of the code for all of theexamples in the book. The examples cover a wide rangeof college math. The only things lacking for meare examples of tensor and differential geometrycalculations possible in Maple version 12.I'd love to see this book updated to cover all thenew features in Maple 12.
1,Don't waste your money on this book.,"This books adds no useful information to the instruction manual that comes with the game. There isn't even an index! At least the instruction manual has that. It does not contain any useful hints other than the obvious from a few times at play. Don't waste your money on this book, you're better off depending on the civilopedia."
3,Ok dvd,"As much as my daughter loves My Little Pony and dogs, she really did not like this movie very much."
2,Healthy Healing: A Guide to Self Healing for Everyone,"Healthy Healing - A Guide To Self Healing For Everyone - The Eleventh EditionThis book has some useful and interesting information about maladies and conditions and how they can be corrected with diet and supplements. However, the main purpose of this book seems to be to encourage you to buy Ms. Page's Supplements. So, most of the information is useless if you don't plan to buy her products."
5,Healthy Healing,"I ordered this for a friend, and she said this was the book she had read about and needed. She also said it was in like new condition, she was amazed that it was used. Iwill continue to shop at amazon.com"
1,"Not a 12"" whisk!","I ordered this whisk believing it would be a 12"" whisk. It is not. The secondary packaging states that it is a 12"" whisk. The tag attached to the whisk clearly states that it is a 10"" whisk. Perhaps a warehouse error. I am returning the item."
3,average,Not sure what I expected but I should've made it myself since it was nothing more than a handerchief wrapped around a sort of bean bag and held with tape.
2,single glass only,This does NOT come as a set of six. This is ONLY ONE glass. Not sure who would pay $30 for a single glass...luckily I paid less than $6.
1,What was missing,"Be careful in ordering this. Although it was suppose to be a set of glasses (6 if I remember correctly), they sent only one glass. $20 for one glass made it a very expensive purchase. They are suppose to send a new order, but this will not happen until April. We will see."
5,Excellent text for 60's in America,As a student and then student teacher of a course using this book i have found it not only personally interesting but a stimulating book for conversation with my students! It is in no way dry but gives insightful analysis of a time too often shown to today's youth in cliches and stereotypes.
5,Tchaikovski 3rd.,"The recording is fine. I needed it for studying the music. We are playing this in a concert, and I wanted to learn it for a greater understanding."
5,poetic visions for children,"Rev. Marie of Rebeccasreads highly recommends BEYOND THE GREAT MOUNTAIN as Caldecott Medal winner author & artist Ed Young offers a book that will enchant adults & children alike as it transports you on a journey of words & art, to a strange & wondrous land far, far way in both time & place.Unique & very different fare for parents & children."
5,Beyone the Great Mountians a simply wonderful childrens book.,This book is a great addition to any elementary classroom. It is visually beautiful and a great introduction to poetry. It can also be used in art class (I use it for poetry and art) as well as a book rich with Chinese culture.
5,stunning,There are really no words but the text itself to describe this poetry. A wonderful way to introduce children to poetic innovation and convention all at once. Took me outside myself.
4,A beautiful piece of art!,"A beautiful piece of art! The book speaks to both the mind and the eye. It words speak to you as the images express the texture. An attractive combination of color and printed word, worthy of reading and looking at!"
4,Timber Wolf,This was a birthday gift for my youngest granddaughter. She will play withe it along with the gray wolf and coyote with her cousins.
4,"well made, best for kids' hands","My son LOVES his wolf puppet! The quality of construction is quite good. The only caution I would offer is that the size of the wolf's mouth is perfect for kids hands, but too small for adult hands (even my very petite hands don't quite fit). So, this puppet is a great option if you want your child to operate it himself, but not so great if you intend to operate it for your child."
5,Great Product,Did exactly what i needed it to do. I had added lowering springs to my accord and this product corrected the resulting camber.
4,Your library definitely needs this book,"Mandy's family live on a farm and it's up to the children to help out with the chores. Dad gives them each one day off though and Mandy chooses to spend her day with her horse, Ben. Beautiful descriptions of experiences, as felt through Mandy's other senses, reveal that she is blind. Her independence is wonderful and the book is a sensational way to naturally introduce children to live with a disability."
5,Still relevant over 15 years later!,"I too am an old fan of this album since it was first released. But I have to say, that when I listen to this today...it's still has the magic. I love Leg's clip before Whatever and Talk Show Host is one of my all time favorite songs ever. I don't care for Love Fool as much as I did when I was a kid but overall this is a great compilation of music. Young Hearts Run Free literally makes me jump out of my chair and strut like a drag queen!"
5,A one of a kind soundtrack!,"The songs on this soundtrack fit every moment in the movie, this is in my top 10 soundtracks of the 90's and if you are a fan of this movie, you have to by the soundtrack!"
5,An amazing book with the beginning of such a story of Toni and GUy Academy,This book it is a jewel in the field of hairstyling and if you can find one of the founders to sign it its value will be 3 6 times higher lovely book I have one used but in good conditions 900 dlls if someone its iinterested hesaye0809@msn.com
5,It couldn't be better!,I loved it! It was really funny! Girls Melanie's age can totally relate to her problems and thoughts! I definitly recomend this book for girls everywhere ages 9-12! This is one of the best books I've ever read!
5,The Diary of Melanie Martin,"A must read with the monalisa, sistin chapel, and boots the cat. Also it has ton of poetry. The book makes your mouth water for more."
1,Leaking!,I never even took it out on the trail because the whole pack was soaked minutes after I filled up the bladder. No good!
1,It leaks!,"I purchased this in May for a hiking trip in July. Each of the three times I wore it, it leaked. The last time I was absolutely soaked. I returned it to Target in Stockton and got a new bladder. I really want this to work. I wore it today, and guess what? The new bladder leaks. I would like to contact the company and see what is happening here."
4,An unfortunate adventure that turns into everyday life.,I have had the pleasure of reading Ann Tyler in the past. This was another great read. Ann has a style of writing that I really enjoy. She is succinct and to the point in her sentencing and at the same time deep and thoughtful with the content. The characters come true to life with their consistent nature and charm. The story weaves you through everyday life issues with metaphors that aren't overstated and add light and color. This is a story I will read again.
4,Illustrated Anatomy of World Fighters,Excellent publication for those interested in Aircraft Cutaways along with its brief history and 3 view of each. For me it filled 37 gaps in my collection of cutaways.
4,Fun toy for young boys,"My four year old son, really likes the Papo knights. They are a great way to promote imaginary play."
2,Recently Redesigned. Pic out of date!,"I have one of these I bought in the past and it is excellent. Has two straps and thus fits very well around knees, elbows, and other joints where it is most often needed.However, it was recently redesigned and they removed the 2 straps for a single add-on strap. It is removable for washing purposes which is ok, I guess. But, it does not stay on or fit well at all. Plus the long strap is very scratchy on skin contact.TheraMed has not even bothered to update their picture of the product on their webpage, so what you see is NOT what you will get!"
2,Disappointing,"They use to have a double connector for this cold pack which made it very versatile. Now it only has one and the texture of the cold pack itself is hard as opposed to the old one which was nice and flexible. Finally, it tends to bunch up inside the pack because they sectioned the pack. There is slightly larger one which is like the old one in texture, but has the same new attachment and sells for a few dollars more. You cannot tell one from the other since the boxes are exactly the same."
3,Product photo is wrong,"I ordered this based on the product photo shown on the product page, and was extremely disappointed to receive a very different version of the product than shown. Please update the photo, otherwise you're just misrepresenting your product. If returning it were easier, I would."
1,Be careful!,I bought this because I had borrowed something similar to this from a friend from this company and it was great. Before I used this I read directions that say it can go directly on skin. I out it in my swollen knee for 15 min...I took it off to find my skin was crunchy. I thawed out my leg and was left with big chemical burns and blisters....similar to a bad sunburn. It was very painful.
4,Spencer Tracy vs. William Powell,"This is a so-so screwball comedy with an all-star lineup... The dialog has some snappy moments, although it's not on a par with ""Bringing Up Baby,"" ""Dinner At Eight,"" et. al... The fun comes in watching male leads Spencer Tracy and William Powell spar with each other (as actors, not their characters...) Their styles are SO different! Tracy typically sledghammers his way though each scene, while Powell hangs back and plays it cool... Both the female leads are fabulous: the ever-luscious Jean Harlow gets a great dramatic monologue at the end, while Myrna Loy rules each scene she's in, with tart dialog and razor-sharp, intelligent delivery. A fine chance to watch some of the finest stars of the 1930s practice their craft. (DJ Joe Sixpack)"
2,DVD transfer O....William Powell and Myrna Loy 2,This is a horrible transfer....well...they (WB) just didn't do any work on it....so that is fine...they have done a splendid job on many new releases...but the ones like this which have no work done...should sell for $10 ...not $20...IMHO.
2,"Poor transfer, missed opportunities","You'd think with a cast like this a film couldn't miss, but somehow this one does. There are a few good moments, but just a few. Looks like the director (Jack Conway) didn't know how to coax the necessary sparkle out of his stars.Add to that the horrible print used for this DVD and you've got a miss that should've been a hit."
4,Good educational and entertaining,Important knowledge for any sailor. Only wish is that there had been more storm footage.
4,What A Story Teller,"This cd is an up and down ride of great story telling wrapped nicely in a gypsy-folk, punk-vibe blanket. If anything, collect this man's cds, learn them, and catch him live!"
3,Ripped off by Sharper Image for Shipping / Handling,Purchased Idog Blue from Amazon (Sharper Image) along with other items as Christmas presents and learned after I ordered that the actual shipping cost was $8.95 for this item. I order the pink Idog and a computer game from Amazon and the shipping on both came to only $5.49 (Free after super saver shipping discount). I will not order anything else that ships from Sharper Image.
3,Cute BUT Get your batteries READY,"Bought it for my daughter, its cute and worked pretty well.. was expecting it to be bigger though. Twice I thought it was broken OR sick (mood), turned out to be the batteries, it can use up energizers like crazy 1 set (2 batteries) in a day. Better stock up on AA's or get 4-6 Rechargeables to swap with."
3,Came without instructions for lefties,"An OT has since told me how to use these. For right handed people the arrow points down and you put your thumb on the side with the star. For lefties, the arrow points up and you put your thumb on the star. Makes a big difference!"
3,"Product is okay, but the shipping and handling was expensive.",It was packed in a simple cover and dropped in the USPS mail. Wouldn't have cost more than a dollar. Yet I paid more than 6 dollars for the standard shipping (more than the cost of the product).
3,Nice Product and Very Helpful - but HIGH Shipping,This is a great product for kids having trouble learning to hold a pencil correctly. My son is double jointed in his thumbs so this helped him to learn to kick his thumb out instead of letting it fall into his hand. Very helpful. I was disappointed with the cost of shipping though. The product comes in a very small package that probably only cost a couple of pennies to mail but yet they charged an arm and a leg. Other than the shipping cost - the product is VERY helpful to kids.
3,Exercise tape featuring the Latin diva,"I don't know how well this tape works for its exercise value, but it's great for Vikki Carr fans. She sings at the end and shows off her home in Beverly Hills. One drawback: Although Carr is obviously speaking English on the tape, she has dubbed over her voice in Spanish. It's rather odd -- why not just use Spanish subtitles?"
4,a bit more than you would expect,"My fiance and I received this 'toy' as a christmas gift last year because we were moving to Argentina. To be honest, we laughed, thinking it to be a rather useless item. However, upon arrival in Latin America, we discovered it to be an extraordinarily useful tool. We use it for everything from menu translations (honestly not its stong-suit, food is so regionally particular) to homework help for our Spanish lessons. It is easy, practical, pocket-sized, and surprisingly loaded.There are only two things that would make this translator the ultimate: 1. some regional colloquialisms; 2. the inclusion of some conjugated forms of some of the more common verbs."
2,"O.K. for English to Spanish verbs, but not vice versa",This translator works very well in conjugating Spanish verbs. However; on Spanish to English it falls short. Its vocabulary for nouns and verb participals is not much better than much smaller and less costly devices.
4,Perfect for Spanish Class,"This little translator got me through 3 years of Spanish classes and a trip to Costa Rica- it's perfect for looking up a vocab word on the spot. The definitions aren't always perfect, so don't trust it implicitly. By far my favorite feature was the quiz, where you added words from the dictionary and it will quiz you on them. Great for drilling them into your head, especially before a test. I just wish I could find one in Italian now..."
2,very small,I was expecting a full size bowl not even large enough for a scoop of ice cream maybe child size serving
5,Devin Kerins better work overtime...we need another book,"Devin Kerins' second installment of life as an EMT is funnier than the first. A must read for anybody in the EMS system and their families. He hits everything dead center,from the ambulance taxi service to the practical jokes to the worst day in every EMTs life. I cannot wait for the next one.P.S. Beware of the broom closet on the 11th floor!"
1,Save your money,"Sadly, it is because of books like this that EMS providers cannot obtain the same respect that police officers and firefighters receive. This book puts EMS as a whole in a bad light and unfortunately, all it takes is one bad apple. I think Mr. Kerins should consider a career change; he is obviously burnt."
1,worst ever,"like gps I don't trust anything but the old fashioned liquid filled compass. I've gotten out of more sticky situations with a good compass then anything digitl. remember they all require batteries and batteries do go dead, so just get a liquid compass."
5,Erica Morini at its best,"Die legendäre Geigerin Erica Morini ist hier in Aufnahmen aus ihrer Glanzzeit zu hören. Insbesondere die Lifewiedergabe des Violinkonzertes von Tschaikowski ist spektakulär:Strawinski äußerte selbst, durch die Vermittlung Morinis sei er 1940 vom Gegner Tschaikowski zum Bewunderer geworden Selbst wenn uns manches an Morinis Spiel heute altertümlich anmutet, spiegelt sich dennoch ausgeprägte Indivdiualität gekoppelt mit Temperament und weiblicher Zartheit darin.Auch die zugegebenen kleinen Stücke sind absolut durchgestaltet, insbesondere am Menuett Mozarts fasziniert die Variabilität der Bogenführung. Für Liebhaber des Violinspiels ein absolutes Muss!"
4,A Door Near Here,This book is mainly about 4 kids that struggle to stay alive with a mom who is and alcoholic. They have a limited amount of food. They have to find a way to share the food and get new food.They all have to tell lies so that no one can find out about their mom being an alcoholic because they don't want to be seperated.I like this book a lot. It's a fun book to read and to see how they pull it through or if they don't. I would recommend this book to anyone.
4,A very good book,"This book is beautifully written with a heartwenching plot. The story pulls you in as Katherine (the oldest of four kids) struggles to keep the household working. However, I could not enjoy the book as much as I would like. The main character (Katherine) was not a very likeable character. Her naiveté and ignorance concerning her mother was annoying and her selfish ideas to keep all help at bay, even at the expense of her siblings made me want to shout at her. However, the fact that the author created such feelings in me is a sign of great ability. Above all, the subplot with Alisa and her search for Narnia and Aslan was sweet and I was very happy to see the religious overtones. C.S. Lewis' books are so religious that it would be a disgrace to the series and his memory to not have the subject brought up."
3,A Door Near Here,"This book was about a family with an alcohalic mother. The mother quit her job, and layed in bed all day and drank. She didnt support the kids or give them money. They had to fend for themselves and make money for food. Her daughter Katherine is trying to keep her brother and two sisters together.I didnt like the book. It was to long and lots of profanity. It wasnt my type of book. It was a little bit confusing. The book is more for adults. If you like to read you would enjoy this book."
3,A Door Near Here,"Me and a couple classmates read 'A Door Near Here'. I personally enjoyed the book and would recommend it to the others, though it is not the kind of reading material I'd prefer to read on my personal time. Still, it was an interesting book that well describes the struggle children undertake when living in a household with an alcoholic parent. I originally had low expectations for the book, but it soon changed once i read a couple chapters into it."
2,Must Read,"This book a door near hear is about four children named Katherine, Douglus, Tracy, and Alisa.The childrens mother is an alcohalic, and has not been out of bed for weeks.So, the four kids have to try to stay alive and not let anyone know that they are doing everthing on their own.They have alot of problems like alisa going crazy, Mr. Dodges butting in to their bussnis,and that they might starve if they do not get more money.I really liked this book because it showed how much they loved each other and never gave up."
5,"A Door Near Here, A good book near you!",A Door Near Here is a great book that you should read. The book is about four brother and sisters that have to survive on their own because their mother won't get out of bed and their father lives far away. Thinking that they might get split up if caught they cover up the fact that their mother is sick. You could relate to the characters in this book. They think and do what you would have done if the same thing was happening to you. I liked how you never knew what was going to happen next to the characters. It made me wonder what would happen if this happened to me. I think that this is a great book and that you should read it.
4,Great and interesting book!,"A Door Near Here is a lot like Homecoming (by Cynthia Voigt). Iam 12 years old, and I recommend this book for 13 and up. The reason Igive it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it had a few foul words and was, in some parts, not as interesting as other books. This, book, however was interesting and somewhat enjoyable. I would recommend reading the Harry Potter books, the Redwall series, Ties that Bind, Ties that Break, and Chinese Cinderella."
3,A Door Near Here,I think that the book was good and tells alot about what happens when people drink and have kids and what the kids have to do when there parents are not there.I think that teens should read this book because it tells what gos on when people drink and how if you dont tell people whats going on you could get worse then you are now and when you get help you are better off and you donbt have to live like that.
3,"Well written story, but predictable and slight","The story being told here is compelling and well written, but I found the plot completely predictable---I was sure what the ending would be after reading barely more than the beginning. I was hoping that it might rise above my expectations, as the author obviously is talented, but it didn't. In addition, the book seemed longer than it needed to be, as if it had to be a certain length, so the writing went on until it was that length. However, I don't mean to discourage reading of it. If you love Narnia as I do, you will find the connection to this book well done. I hope someday to read more by this author---perhaps a more mature and original book."
2,A Door Near Here,"A Door Near Here was a ok book. The main point of the book was really a mother that negelected the childeren. So then the oldest child named Katherine had to run the house hold, so basicly she was the mother. I guess the book shows that every family needs a parent that is responsiable and a kid can't do it. Katherine had to take care of her two sisters and one brother they were all younger then her. Douglas, Tracey, and Alisa the youngest. The author Heather Quarles gives the book an unrealistically happy ending which I thought was a pretty good idea that mad the book a little better. Althought adults eventually take charge, life is only a little better for everyone concerned."
4,A Door Near Here,"My name is Emma .I read A Door Near Here by:Heather Quarles.The book was about four kids who live with there mother.There mother is out of work and she is an alcoholic.The oldest child Katherine is trying to take care of all them and still go to school.When there little sister,Alisa,tries running away from schoolto go toNarnia,the principle forces her to stay home till she can see a doctor.They decide to take her to school and she gets caught and tells Mr.Dodgson,a teacher about all there moms proplems and how Katherine is taking care of all them.Katherin,Douglas,and Tracey all have a dad who lives in Michigan,but there worried because Alisa doesn't and the social services will take her away.There running out of food and money and all the teachers are getting suspicious.I really liked the book because it had to do with real kids and real life,because no matter how hard people try to hide things like this they really needed helpand shouldn't pretend things are all right."
5,BRILLIANT,I REALLY THINK THAT BLACK JACK IS A GOOD BOOK FROM BEGINNING TO END. I THINK EVERY HOUEHOLD SHOULD HAVE A COPY.
5,Story of America today,"Great story and great characters. Love it from beginning to end. If you have ever visited a casino, this is a must read."
5,"Fantastic and Funny, Yet Good Drama",Exciting dramatic novel. Easy to read. Great characters with good human emotions. I loved it.
5,great,The story line is quite interesting. I could visualize all the characters in my mind. WOW! This would be a great movie. At this price it's a steal. If you are in search of great entertainment this is the one to buy!
2,"A good start, very objective, but poorly put together","This book is an excellent start for anybody trying to do research for Daddy Grace. But there are a LOT references that do not match up!!!!!! I go to look for the articles and many of them do NOT EXIST where he says they do!!! It's very quickly and POORLY put together. Also, as a church member of the House of Prayer he should have gotten his facts together and consulted our present bishop, Daddy Madison before doing this. I have found more articles in regular research than he has in this entire book. He should have spent more time and effort on this. However, this book is more objective than a lot of things I have read on the House of Prayer. I'm glad he wrote it, its a great start for someone like me doing research on Sweet Precious Daddy Grace."
1,Did you Know the Man?,"From the reviews of previous readers, I know this book is full of lies. There is no more to be said!"
1,you need to check your facts,"hello, sister girl we are a church of dedicated members. now before you decided to write this book you should have called Daddy madison to get the full facts."
4,Great resource,"For a lover of history that is interested in getting little known references about Daddy Grace I think Mr. Davis' book points you in the right direction. I was once a member of the United House of Prayer for All People for 14 years and unfortunately I didn't get a chance to see Daddy Grace. He died three years before I was born. Nevertheless the wonder about Bishop Grace thrived within me because of the stories my grandmothers told me. My grandmothers were loyal members of Bishop's Grace's church, joining in the early days, and filled my head with stories. They loved Daddy Grace. To be honest, when you interview members of the United House of Prayer for All People you get a one sided view, filled with legends about Bishop Grace. Mr. Davis' book lays out straightforward resources that examine the cult's founder. I didn't know there were so many articles, books, and dissertations written about Daddy Grace. What an interesting character in history he was. Thanks Mr. Davis."
4,Great for the price,"Some things that aren't in the description:-The charger that it comes with is a cord plugs into the back of the handle, and it charges the battery while it's attached to the drill. It uses the standard B&D; removable 18V battery which can be charged in a seperate charger (that isn't included of course).-The 30 piece accessories set is a set of 10 drill bits sizes 1/16 to 1/4, 10 2-sided screwdriver bits, and 10 socket bits sizes 5/32 to 1/2.It's a good small cordless drill, especially for the price."
5,Perfect for your young reader!,"My 6 year old son is struggling with reading, and even other ""Level One"" books that I thought he would like (like Star Wars ones) are just too hard. I mean, what beginning reader can read the words Anakin Skywalker for crying out loud!!!!!???I bought these and I just want to cry I am so happy. He can read them, and feels such a sense of victory to be able to read an intelligible story. His sweet proud little smile at the end tells it all! Buy the Dick and Jane books for your new reader -- why try and reinvent the wheel? These books have been around forever for a good reason!"
4,Your Heart in Music,"This is an amazing CD. It reflects the heart in all of its moods, but most of all in its purity and gives you freedom to express your own heart as you sing or dance along. From the upbeat and even funny reggae style of ""Kundalini Ma"" to the hypnotic and haunting ""O Divine Mother"" the music and lyrics are a joy that linger and stay with you - - you'll find yourself humming as you walk down the street. It's a wonderful CD to just listen to or to enhance, accompany and explore your yoga practice. Best of all, it's a sweet introduction to bhakti and chanting for those who've been curious but hesitate - - and a new spin for bhaktinis everywhere. JAI!"
3,From one who has had colon cancer,"After being diagnosed with colon cancer, I started my research by reading books on the subject.I found this book was well wriiten, but seem to focus more on explaining the disease for family or somebody wanting to provide support for a person with colon cancer. In this respect, it does a good job in explaining the disease and giving points to consider, i.e., the type of hospital, the way to reference doctors, etc.The book did not fit what I was looking for. I wanted a more technical explanation about the disease and what to expect during the operation and post-operative period. I did not get that comfort level from this book."
3,The Beatles Before Beatlemania,"This CD compiles 12 some tracks the Beatles recorded back in 1962 with Tony Sheridan before they made it big and were struggling musicians. All the songs on here are raw and down to earth rock n roll songs bassicly. Key tracks include, Cry for a Shaddow, and My Bonnie. All in all good album to buy for someone whose knee deep into the Beatles"
1,I wish I could give it zero too,"To think that they have two failed LP's whcih have since been dubbed 'Birth of a legend' and 'Yellow Matter Custard' in their pockets and the only rare stuff we get is THe Beatles with Tony Sheridan. This album is worth steeringh clear of. The Beatles only appear properly on two songs, the first two songs. On the other twelve songs Tony Sheridan is the lead vocalist and only half fo those song feature the Beatles on backing. The 'Beat Brothers' are not the Beatles. Oh, by the way, Birth of a legend is an early 1962 LP that they cut for Decca, who didn't sign them, and the BBC didn't sign them on the strength of 'Yellow Matter Custard', which it wasn't originally called. Third time lucky, I suppose. But even if they aren't as good as Please Please Me or Sergeant Pepper, they are two LP's made up entirely of Beatles songs, and the public and the fans deserve to have these two albums released!"
4,Still fresh ...,"I'm very happy with the result - you can examine a noticeable improvement in sound. I own this album in different kinds - but the sound I've never heard before. The engineers did a good job.Ok, Tony Sheridan slightly missed the class of the big rock'n'roller - but this album is not one of them, the Beatles (and of course Tony) have to feel ashamed. I'm strongly recommended this release.Further it's a fresh testimony of the wild Reeperbahn days. And as a man, grown up near by Hamburg/Germany, I love this album."
4,"Pretty good, not just for historical reasons","This is not bad stuff. An interesting peek at the Beatles' early commercial recordings. The instrumental ""Cry for a Shadow"" (aka ""beatle Bop"") makes you wonder why they didn't record more instrumentals. Tony Sheridan sounds like a British Elvis, and his singing compliments the Beatles' playing quite well, particularly on the ballad ""Why."" Best of all is the first Beatle record to be publicly released, ""My Bonnie"" with it's energetic instrumetals and the Fab 4's harmony. Incidentally, you get a chance to hear original drummer Pete Best here. You all know the story about his drumming and firing. In fairness, Pete kept time well, but compare this with a Ringo recording and you be the judge. In either case, get this and get a piece of history that has a nice beat that you can dance to."
3,Good for a hardcore fan,"I bought this album expecting to hear more than two rare Beatles tracks, but that's all there are! The sound quality is quite good, and the two tracks featuring the Beatles sound great, but that's it. The rest are tracks featuring The Beatles backing up Tony Sharidan (England's version of Elvis). Also, according to two books I've read, the liner notes are misleading if not plain WRONG! If you are a purist or a hard core fan, than this is for you, but if you already own Anthology One, don't waste your cash."
5,"Inspirational memoir of a ""Bad Boy"" turning ""Good Guy""!",What a life story and what a change of direction Sal Greco took. He went from organized crime and on a sure road to hell to the ministry. Totally riviting story and one that you cannot put down until you read the last sentence on the last page of the book. The story will inspire hope that everyone can change their lives for the better.The book would make for a great movie except that no one woulod believe it. His life reads like a novel. It is captivating and enteretaining and it is all true!I highly recommend that everyone who enjoys personal stories of redemtion and gracce pick up a copy of this book and read it.
4,Forschner/Victorinox knife,This is a quality knife that I enjoy using. The price of the knife was fair although I believe that the shipping was a bit high and took a little longer than I liked before I received the product.
2,not very good...,"i've read dozens of outlines in this biblical vien. read, 'what the bible is all about for young explorers' by henrietta mears. so far it's the best outline i've found."
5,Excellent Book,This book is great. The words rhyme as you read along which makes it fun to read for young children. The pictures are bright and colorful and go along with the words on each page. The pictures make youngsters laugh. My 3-year old son memorized this book in 2 readings and now thinks he can read. Now he asks for new books to read all the time. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to get their children excited about reading.
4,Cute book,It was a cute book. I would recommend it to others who have children learning to read. For my 6 year old that is learning to read some of the words were a little tough at first but she is getting it and the story is okay with cute little illustrations.
2,Hawkwind - 'Urban Guerilla' (Brook),"Oh, come now! No one is likely to get fooled by this repressing (how many of them actually exist to this day?) of the NOW infamous 'Bring Me The Head Of Yuri Gagrin' CD. Can you say 'completist' or 'die-hards'? I'll bet you can."
2,"yuk, messy,","Not only is this messy but the mixes are terrible. the button to the mixer is broken and the cooler back piece will not stay on. I would not recomend this toy, it is easier to make real brownies and less messier."
4,"GREAT Toy, Awful Food","This is an awesome little kitchen. My 3 year old daughter LOVES it! She loves to make her own food and her favorite part is using the blender, mixing bowl, dispensing the water from the refrigerator and watching the food ""cook."" This is a wonderful toy all around, but the brownies are horrible! I almost gagged when I tasted it, but my daughter didn't seem to mind at all. Even when she doesn't make the food, she loves to play with the refrigerator water dispenser and pretends to mix and blend foods. So, even when the food mixes run out, the toy will still have a long life."
3,Okay,I recived this toy for x mas 2003 the shakes were okay the brownies were okay and the jello was okay .It was so much fun to cook it but the oven did not really cook the brownies.
2,Yuck,"While my 5 year old daughter enjots playing with it, it's a MESS. The little pieces are hard to use, the mixes are gross."
2,Nasty,I purchased this for my grand daughter because she loves to help me in the kitchen. The food was worse than disgusting. The brownies tasted like rancid vegtable oil. The jello tasted like paste. Don't waste your money!!!!
1,Not a fun toy,"If you want to buy this toy. I want to say that it is not worth the money. I saved up all my money and I got a bad toy. The smoothies taste like barf, The Jello is soooooo bad it is like poop. The choacolate is ok but, DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Fun, but just don't eat the food!","This toy is best used just for fun, without actually eating the food, which is thoroughly horrible. What taste testers could have possibly found this food to be edible?!"
2,waste of money,Not useful information. It is someone's viewpoint of a Bat/Bar Mitzvah and you may giggle a little at her jokes but it is not really a helpful book.
2,Not Very Useful,Gives information must people already have about their child's bat or bar mitzvah. The other information is only for the elite few.
1,MitzvahChic,"I've never written an online review, but I felt compelled to let other parents know not to waste their money. The book was aweful! We live in Los Angeles, have a top notch party planner and a fabulous caterer and are 5 month's away from our son's Bar Mitzvah. According to the author, we're doing everything wrong! Hard to believe, since we've got all of this wonderful professional help. Read ""Putting God on the Guest List"" instead."
3,"Wonderful songs, not so well sung","I am not very fond of Benjamin Luxon. I think his voice is a bit too heavy for English art songs, and his interpretations of the text rarely agrees with mine. However, he has excellent taste in music so if you like his voice you should definitelybuy this CD."

5,C.J.Date Database in Depth,C.J. Date is the expert on relational databases. This is a great book I use it in my Systems Analysis and Design Class.
2,Grumpy theory,"Contains only theory, with little real-word usefulness, despite what the author claims. Comes across as if it's written by a grumpy old man, constantly complaining about how SQL gets everything wrong."
2,forget this and just get SQL and Relational Theory,"I bought two of C.J.Date's book, one being SQL and Relational Theory (How to Write Accurate SQL code) hoping to find something new as the title suggested. However, looking at the table of contents of both the books, i find the same content is repeated in his new book (SQL and Relational Theory).So, forget about this one if you were to buy his new book."
3,"Good material, awful editing","The material is interesting, C.J. Date tries to go beyond the practicality of SQL and back to fundamentals of relational theory. He makes interesting points about NULL, duplicate values and such, but this assumes a fair level of familiarity with SQL (viz. you use SQL on a regular basis).I find the editing poor in that the author very often states that some point is explained in later chapters or later in a given chapter. While this is fine once or twice, it quickly becomes tiresome and frustrating; to many forward references.This book is not quite a theory book (light on the math side) but a book to be read nonetheless as it delves into matters seldom found in database books (at least the mainstream crop)."
2,Could use more depth,"I came to this looking for a systematic development of the relational model, as a prelude to some personal experimentation. I came away with a lot less than I hoped. The book largely uses an informal, chatty, opinionated approach, but throws in a few more rigorous dribs and drabs at irregular intervals. The informal parts, although they present hard-won knowledge and good practice, don't provide a satisfyingly strong foundation. The occasion paragraph or two with real technical rigor doesn't fill the gap. Those moments stand isolated, not really part of the narrative flow, and generally lack the formal notation that could have made their meanings precise.Date advertises his other books heavily throughout this one - perhaps one of them has the kind of detail I was hoping for. And, perhaps that book won't use terms likeDesignTheoryin ways so at odds with other established usages.-- wiredweird"
5,Great book!!!,"I was very pleased by this book. It is printed on a quality paper, with a lot of colorful pictures and photographs. It does not only writes and shows Kamasutra positions, but it talks about its history, sex in generally, it gives you lot of tips and references. It covers so much, that I don't need to buy any other books."
3,"The same as her other Kama Sutra Book, just smaller","I have both of Hoopers Kama Sutra books, and I have to say that I like this one better. Why? you ask. Well, one main reason. I gave the larger book only 2 stars, I just thought that most of the stuff was normal positions and stuff. Well, this is the exact same book, but..... and this is a big thing, it is tiny. You can just stick it in a drawer by your bedside and flip through it if you want. I still stick by my original thoughts of the bigger book which is the same for this one visually, but it is a nice little compainion for your bedside table."
5,"Excellent buy, well written and helpful","I found this book to be an excellent guide to the modernized Kama Sutra. Filled with helpful pictures, original quotes and simple explinations, I find it is an easy read. Also there are a number of sections of background text, giving a bit of history or meaning to the positions, showing that the author really knows her stuff. Highly recomended."
4,Kiss Guide to Kama Sutra,This book was very educational and my partner and I learned a lot about each other
3,review,"I found the photographs in this book to be somewhat disturbing. Not because of the nature, but because the people invoved seemed to be miserable. There is very little prose in the book."
4,A great collection.,"If you know Nina Simone, then you will love this compilation. The only jarring aspect is that it's from multiple periods in her career, so it seems to jump around quite a bit in styles. However, it's full of some of her greatest performances."
5,BLACK IS THE COLOR !!!!!!!,I LOVE THIS. I'VE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS LOSTED TO ME BUT NOW I HAVE IT. THX AMAZON
4,Happy Holidays special Edition Barbie Doll 1998,The Service was very prompt. She is beautiful but I really don't think that the pink shawl matches. Thats just my idea. I like her dress better without it. She is still very beautiful. I collect special Barbies.
1,DON'T LIKE IT,DON'T LIKE IT. BOUGHT IT ONLY FOR THE COLLECTION AND BECAUSE IT WAS A HOLIDAY BARBIE AND I HAVE THEM ALL!!
2,Keep Looking...not much of a machine,"I bought this item less than a year ago. It worked OK for a while then began to leak out of the detergent container, then problems arose with the GFI plug, then the motor faltered. Just not what I consider a quality unit. I'd have been better off to spend more and get a quality unit."
3,It's Vipassana Meditation,"It's a wonderful introduction to meditation with lots of resources at the back. If you've never meditated, this is the way to start.Just remember nothing happens over night, unless you're the Buddha, and even he was searching for six years before he got it right."
1,Not so Good,Dino's in the snow is not as good as the other books by this author. I found the text rather difficult to follow. I would not suggest this book for others to buy.
4,Unique Approach to Poetry,"Ice Floe is a wonderful collection of poems from the famous and not so famous from around the world who share a common life experience--living in the arctic regions of our globe. The poems are in many languages, some obscure, but all are also translated into english. Many of the poets speak of the unique experiences of living in the far north such as, endless summer days and non-existent winter daylight, as well as wildlife, and the difficulties of living in extreme conditions. I found this a delightful collection of poems."
4,I like because this book has some Matlab program,I like because this book has some Matlab programI knew it in the your siteit has many examples
4,good bedtime book; also nice if you like bears or caves,"Frank Asch's _Good Night Baby Bear_:Baby Bear doesn't want to go to sleep in the cave. He has a litany of complaints/stalling tactics, including needing water, needing food, and needing to see the moon. Ingenious (and patient!) mother bear satisfies each request, and eventually mother bear and baby bear fall asleep happily.A good offering from Frank Asch. Illustrations are bold and blocky, with nothing terribly intricate or cluttered about them. Text is easy to understand, with just a sentence or two on each page. Great for 2- and 3-year olds, maybe a solid bedtime book for 4- and 5-year olds as well.I've used this as a bedtime book with my 2-year old many times, and he seems to like it quite a bit, though it's not his favorite.Be sure to also check out Frank Asch's _Goodbye House_, which I think is his best book.ken32"
5,A Great Read,This is such a touching look at the relationship between a mother and her child. I love this great book.
2,a little flimsy and short,"These triangular cages can also be set up un-folded in a zig-zag pattern that would be good for shorter peas, or folded, for non-vining plants like peppers or eggplants.However, for tomatoes, these cages are really low quality. They are flimsy and shorter than I expected. I ordered a LOT of them, so I'm going to try to make do. Sending them back would be a major effort. Lesson learned there...They fold flat, but when set up, they don't stay together well, so I've had to use pliers to tighten the hooks--this will no doubt make it difficult to fold them back up at the end of the season. I will be stacking two together to make them taller, which I've done before successfully with square folding cages. These, though, will require reinforcing with twine or something.I've got some other square welded wire cages, and they are sturdy and set up easily and stay that way, without extra work on my part. You get what you pay for."
5,Cool Doc!,Absinthe was always this mysterious elixir to me. Once I saw the documentary all of my questions were answered! I've never tried it but now I'm definitely interested. Story is told very well and there are some great commentators who really get to the bottom of the myths and realities surrounding the drink. Some cool visuals too. Definitely recommended if you are thinking about trying absinthe or are just interested in learning more about it. Kudos to the director.
5,"Lovely, lilting aloha","Other than the first song with was written by her mother, all these tracks are Mihana originals. She is a lovely lady from Kailua (O'ahu) who can write country, jazz, Hawaiian and other styles. In fact, over the years, she has won ""Best Of"" awards in each category. This particular album has a country/folk tinge to it. One gorgeous song (both lyrics and music) after another. This is a gentle, classy album by a gentle classy woman."
2,undependable,"This headlamp was fine at first, but after a few short uses, the light would fade in and out, regardless how often the battery was changed & it finally gave out completely. It was only used at home to view CD & LP border titles in dim light conditions & for better vision while reading on the patio. The adjustable light was convenient, but this light just wasn't worth the money it cost."
2,Janacek/Vixen,"Wonderful opera, great production, poor transfer. No subtitles! And This will be coming out soon in the Felsenstein box set, remastered, so this issue is now superfluous."
3,Lives up to it's title,"I have played piano for over 40 years, but am an a neophyte accordion player. I bought this to learn some basics. It's an adquate book for very basic purposes.Most accordions in this country are 120 bass piano accordions. The book starts out with reference to a 12 bass instrument there is no mention of other bass button configurations, other than a chart of the buttons on a 120 bass instrument on the last page. The exercises and practice tunes are predictably simple ad a bit boring, but it's difficult to put catchy tunes in a book for beginners.One criticism is that throughout the book the word ""ledger"" is mis-spelled as leger.Overall the book is adequate and fairly priced."
1,Missed opportunities,Whilst Clarke does an admirable job of tracing the wealth of the Tsar he missed his best opportunity - in the United States. He missed opportunities to demonstrate that some of the very people he writes about - George Romanosky and Sidney Reilly to name a few - were attempting to arrange letters of credit at the New York City Bank. Moreover the failed conclusion on the link between Sidney Reilly and the Remington Rifle Company is an oversight that can not be excused.It would have been overly generous to grant more than one star because he could have shed so much more light on the trail if he had not gotten off the trail prematurely. His effort was brave and worthwhile but I was severly disappointed in the outcome. Perhaps he should have employed a top notch research assistant in the United States.
3,Does NOT touch you Reiki,I ordered this book because i wanted to learn how to do Reiki. Only after reading the first chapter did i find that this book is not to touch one how to do Reiki healing which is what i was looking for. However it is a good book on the magickal side of Reiki but if you want to learn how to perform Reiki order Reiki for beginners instead.
3,Mediocre with Terrible Sound Quality,"I really don't care for Nick Tart, but I could let that go if the songs were good. Unfortunately, that's not the case since this is a whole album of filler. The worst part is that it sounds like crappy MP3 files with an extremely low bit rate. Come on, now... I can't be the only person to notice this."
2,Expected more,"I expected to receive more cards for what I paid for. Cards were in good shape and delivered promptly, just not what I expected. Also thought for the little amount that I purchased that the shipping charge was too high."
1,The Worst Book on Chinese Black Magic,"I have read a few books on the subject and found that this book is the worst. The better ones are in Chinese, complete with chants, talismans, etc.It it extremely weak on the workings of Chinese black magic and the author keeps rattling about myths and legends. It is especially lacking in practical details. There aren't good examples of talismans being illustrated, there is no information about the details of setting up the altar, constructing the straw man, days of the year which one should not draw the talismans, etc.This book is more on myths and legends than throwing light on the practical details of Chinese black magic that still survives today. The writing style is also extremely weak and I share the same view as the previous reviewer."
4,Mistress to an Age,"The book was in fine condition which means it had probably never even been opened since it was printed in 1957. It is a thick book (paperback). The minute I opened it the cover flew off. That was okay with me as it made it easier to turn the pages. After about 150 pages of the book, I found it a bore so that said 'enough already!' and I am now off to another book."
5,Great deal!!!,"I am currently pregnant with my 3rd child and since my hands are swollen and I can no longer wear my wedding ring, I bought this as an alternative. It is perfect! The price was great! Shipping was excellent! So much so, in fact, that I bought a matching band for my husband so we could still match."
5,Ring,I am wearing it right now and have since I recieved it in the mail. This company really came through and delivered it really fast...!
3,"imperfections in ""new"" ring?","The price is good. The shipping is FAST (arrived 1 week before expected). The product is okay. It is stamped 925, so in theory it is solid silver. But, my ring arrived with a black spot on one side which looked like tarnish and a scratch on the outer surface of the ring. I cleaned the ring with toothpaste, thinking it might be tarnish. The scratch and black spot are less visible after cleaning, but they are still visible if you look closely. This is fine for me as this is just an everyday ring to wear to the gym and such, but if you want a ""perfect"" ring, this is probably not your product."
5,"Super Fast shipping, quality items","Nice bands, very well made. The items arrived in a couple days.I would order 1/2 size bigger and you'll be fine. I did. I would like to see more comfort fit bands offered as well. Thanks"
2,Not what I was expecting from other reviews...,I read other reviews and bought the ring based on them. I did not like it. There was a weird smudge-like mark in the ring that was there for good. It was too big too (my fault entirely) so in the end it didn't work on any account. Even if it had fit I doubt i would have kept it though. In the reviews people said that it matched their white gold well but the it sure didn't match mine. It wasn't the same color or shine.
5,Simple and elegant,This is the perfect ring if you are looking for something very simple. It compliments any diamond ring or can be worn alone. Also use as a thumb ring.
4,"a little thinner than I'd like, but otherwise great","no complaints, I just wish I'd ordered a thicker one. Fits true to size, seems durable, great backup ring for travelling!"
4,Nice ring,"This ring is nice, the comfort fit means you don't even feel it on your finger when wearing it. In hindsight I probably would have bought a thicker size as 3mm is very thin and doesn't really look like much on my finger, but this is my issue and nothing to do with the ring. It's great considering the price."
2,...,"i bought this cd hearing from a friend how cool they were.We usually agree on punk music, but not this time.I have listened to this cd 1 time through and i barely made it, it is that bad. The vocals are terrible, when he sings he sounds like me when i was 5.The screaming is what he is good at but sometimes over uses it. Best song by far is girls not grey, but the cd is not like the song at all!One thing i like about the albumb is the different styles of music they use on the cd. so i kinda respect them."
3,slightly disgruntled,"starts off strong, then....? ends pretty strong .... but the middle 60% of the album??? by the way im an old AFI fan, black sails at sunset and open your eyes and shut your mouth are pure masterpieces where as this could have been so much more."
3,alright,"hey,overall this was a decent CD. but i liked afi the way they were before. more punk rock\hardcore. this album is more goth punk. and i dont like the idea of afi going mainstream. my favorite song was dancing through sunday because of the bitchin' guitar solo. thats all i have to say. rock on"
2,dont hate davey hate comercialism,i along with the rest of the true afi fans will find this album to be...im sorry but a major lable jump just did the same thing it has to all punk bands turned them to emo wusses so please if you buy this album dont get mad at afi get mad at all the little kids in the mall who think this is thier first album
5,GREATEST CD EVER,"this is the greatest cd i have ever gotten.....AFI is one of the greatest things out there....the lyrics are powerful, dark and melodic....anyone who loves morbid melodic music will love AFI's Sing the Sorrow"
2,"After listening to this album, I felt, nothing!","This album had no impact on me what so-ever! I didn't like half the songs and the others were just to boring to get into. AFI seems like one of those bands that are trying to make a point or something like that but really I didn't get that message. I guess some of the song are catchy and I only bought it during that phase where I was just getting into Rock and punk was a new thing to me so I didn't know what to get.If you want a cool punk Rock band I reccomend all of the follwoing bands:1. The Ramones2. The Clash3. The Sex PistolsWell, actually what I said before (about not having any feeling about this album) was not 100% true. The one feeling I did get was that they were trying to hard to mix punk and there own type of hard Rock, it just didn't work for me. Thumbs Down!!!"
1,Sorrow Sells as AFI proves,"After I found Black Sails in the Sunset I became an instant AFI fan, its by far the best of its kind, dark, fast, focused and pretty! Now more about image and glamor then ever AFI takes the jump to big money, fame and DREAMWORKS (what the hell?) This album has none of the feeling of what the older stuff did, all I can feel in it now is big money and glamor. Davey leads a nation of Hot Topic crazed teens into a dark depressing capitalist future. Its a damn shame!-AP"
3,AFI dips into the main stream,"AFI made their major label debut with Sing the Sorrow, and became one of the ""coolest"" new bands on the MTV scene with their singles ""Girl's Not Grey"", ""Silver and Cold"", and ""The Leaving Song Pt. 2"". Sing the Sorrow is a solid introduction to the veteran punk band for those not in touch with any underground music. AFI's music has continued to progress, and fans of their previous release, The Art of Drowning, will love the emphasis on hard-edged guitars and soaring melodies on Sing the Sorrow. If you are a punk fan check out Black Sails in Sunset and Art of Drowning before picking up Sing the Sorrow. Overall, this is a solid album. I listened to it constantly for an entire month when I first picked it up from the store, and the songs are catchy and extremely well written. It receives 3 stars because the repeat value has diminished considerably."
4,A Solid Album,"I must admit that I'm usually not into this specific type of rock, but I really enjoy this album. It can be listened to straight through and I like the mood it sets. The secret song at the end is pretty cool and there are some great songs. It isn't quite 5 stars for me but maybe 4.5."
5,"A new phase, form and sound.","This is a really good CD. I was never very fond of their earlier CDs but the new stuff is really good. Whether or not AFI has become mainstream, Davey's words are more poetic and haunting. Though not for everyone, these once ""punks"" have followed what seems natural for them. The instumental sections are amazing, and Davey's voice seems to be more connected in this new form. All in all, I think it is an amazing CD and the secret site is really great, there are free song downloads that are amazing. If you have the CD you should check it out."
5,PERFECTBEAUTIFULCREATIVEBEAUTYWONDERFUL,"Sing the Sorrow- the best album yet ever created. Has something that has been missing from music for years since Nirvana, melody, creativeness, artistic beauty, heart and soul, meaning, and talent. It's perfect all the way through with something that I've always wanted/needed/yerned to hear, gothic deep hard edge with a sweet voice and beautiful melodies."
5,Gets you through anything,"I was never a big fan of punk music. Then again I was never a big fan of rock until I bought Metallicas Load, then eventually I started buying they're albums backwards, my final purchase being Kill 'em all. The same goes with AFI, I bought Sing The Sorrow because of the singles and since then, ive bought Art of Drowning and Black Sails in the Sunset. Sing the Sorrow is truly a masterpiece in its time. With all these ""The"" bands coming out, this is truly an oasis in the desert of [bad] music. I just recently broke up with my girlfriend and this album kept me occupied, its been in my car cd changer for months and it will be there for many more months to come. But I must warn you...It is NOT Art of Drowning and Black Sails in the Sunset."
5,Forever Sing The Sorrow,"This CD is awesome. A must buy for any Die Hard AFI fans our there. And seeing as I can't find the words to describe the music AFI plays, I would also recommend this to people who have never listened to AFI. It's something new for them. And honestly, I cannot name a band that sounds anything like them. So get online, or go to a record store, and buy the CD! it's awesome!"
5,Amazing,"I've been listening to AFI for years and this is by far one of the best albums i've ever heard. There is never a dull moment and the ending to the the cd is simply wonderful. I highly suggest you go and pick this record up, if you enjoy AFI you shouldn't be dissapointed."
5,sing the sorrow kicks...,I love this CD. I guess you could call me an avid A.F.I. fan.. i have a couple of their earlier releases and stuff. This one is by far my favorite though. It doesn't have a single track and everything blends well. I can listen over and over without stopping or skipping. I strongly recommend it to anyone who likes good music.. tight cd..
5,AFI Back to Black Sails Style,"This album completely blew me away. I am a die hard AFI fan, and I was disappointed with The Art of Drowning, because I felt that they lost a lot of the intensity and fury that they had in their earlier albums. This album, however, has totally rekindled the ""dark flame"" inside me. Each song has thoughtful lyrics, beautiful melodies, and the passion for dark music that only AFI has. Some of the songs kind of have an emo-ish vibe, some of them are straight hardcore, and one thing is for sure, their major label has not changed them at all. I waited in line for an hour to meet them and get my copy signed, and they are so nice and humble and appreciative of all their fans. AFI rocks, get this album and Black Sails and prepare yourself for a ride."
5,OH MY GOD!!!,"this album is the [best] album AFI has ever made. the design for the album is beautiful and it sounds awesome. the cd is overflowing with the sickest songs ever, like my personal favorites,""The Great Disappointment"" and ""Silver and Cold"". ""Miseria Cantare (The Beginning)"" has a chilling chorus which hypnotized me from the moment i heard it. the album is a MUST HAVE! what more could you expect from AFI????"
5,The Fire Inside Is Growing Up,This new album is great! I personally love it. There will be some AFI fans that will like and won't. The reason this is true is because it's a very different version of AFI. Every new album they make is different and they grow all the time. I think true AFI fans will love this album.
5,Sing your sorrow,"What to write about a trully stunning band/album?AFI's 6th full lenght studio album, and their 1st major label debut comes after 11 years. During this time the band have come a long way.Sing The Sorrow, follows up from the bands 2000 release of Art Of Drowning, where the band already gave a warning for what is to come and what they are capable of. The dynamics of the music are absolutelly amazing. The production really takes AFI to a new level. Hotly hyped in the media as the realease of the album made atleast my self verry suspicious about the record. Was it going to be 10 ""morning stars"" all over again. To best of my luck it was not!Sing the Sorrow is deffinatelly one of the albums of 2003. This album is trully an album that defines AFI as a band and their carreer."
3,Sing the Sorrow IS AFI's best,"Sing the Sorrow really IS AFI's best CD to date. Finally, a fully album that sounds great cranked-up, with more mature lyrics, better vocals and musicianship, etc. Those long-time fans who think AFI has mellowed, just don't understand. As a musican grows and matures, the music almost always does as well. This is the same type of thinking of the long-time Metallica fans who got upset over the fact they cut their hair short a few years ago! C'mon! Get a grip. Grow with the music. Buy this album!"
2,WOW! this album is [weak],"When i first recieved this album from a friend of mine, i was so happy for i had been a fan of AFI for years, since Shut your Mouth Open your eyes, and a fire inside. But this cd is such a damn dissapointment.Darvey's singing is great but i don't want to hear throughout the whole entire album without any decent instruments being played. This Album is literally focused on ALL EMO, too much emo my friends, is not a good thing. this is definilatey not the same group as it was 2 years ago.Rest Assure AFI fans, i know for a fact this is not the end for AFI, their next album will be awesome.SIng the Sorrow, has made me a lesser fan of AFI, but i still love them"
2,... Not that good,"It seems kind of funny to me whats happened to this band. It really seems like davey isturning into a younger version of glenn danzig in the sense that they both used to be good; then they were not that good; then they grew their hair out to shoulder length.Most all the songs on this cd are pretty bad (despite the fact that i had girls not grey stuck in my head for weeks ), but in my opinion some aret that bad. I would give this a 2 and a half, cos the songs can be very catchy, but thi sband has disapointed many people, so i rated down.I was watching MTV2 a while ago and saw afi live, and i'll tell you this : Its kind of a dead give-away that a bands sold out when the lead singer stands on top of a big MTV logo and sings a radio hit. (that was just for the kids that say ""they have not sold out!"") Bye"
2,buy there OLDER STUFF,"This album is a good album but not for afi,people described this as punk no its not!buy thier albums like very proud of ya."
4,pretty cool,"this is pretty good for a punk band. im more into the black/death genre. but this is a good band. best tracks are 2,5,6,7"
5,show some respect,"Although this might not be where afi started, and i agree they have better albums, to anyone who trashes this cd may u die a slow and painful death. No person could honestly bash afi, everyone has their own tastes and i understand if someone didn't like afi, and thats fine..... but selling themselves short cmon"
4,...,"This CD is amazing and very beautiful. AFI is taking a slight different direction with this CD but not a bad direction at all. I listen to this CD constantly. The music and the words are truly beautiful. There's so much emotion and feeling in the CD. Though a lot of the emotion is indeed sorrow it's great none the less. This CD should please long time fans and people who have never heard AFI before could really enjoy the album. I recomend it to anyone. They have some new sounds that may come to some suprise in some of their songs but they are really great as well. Right from the intro song this CD grips you and all the way through the ending monologues and ""hidden song"" it doesn't let you go."
2,A band thats changed alot,"It all depends on what kind of music you like but this is an alright cd. I was a bigger fan of them before they signed on dreamworks. If you think about it, they went to traditional punk to metaly emo punk to poppy metalish. Oh well I think there getting a litte too popular for my tastes."
4,Big Label Doesn't Change Sound,"AFI is a fan-favorite band. If they were to change their music to fit at a major label, they would lose everyone and gain new, MTV fans. Luckily, this is not what AFI has done with Sing the Sorrow. Listening to the album makes you think ""That's definitely AFI,"" not ""Why did they change their music?"" As with every new release, there will be new sounds and new styles to tap into, which AFI has done supremely well with Sing the Sorrow. This is a great CD to pick up for any AFI fan, or if you're wanting to try something new."
5,AFI - Sing The Sorrow EXPLOSIVE CD A MUST BUY!,"AFI's new CD released March 11, 2003 has the most beautiful lyrics with such vibrancy I have ever heard. I believe it's the best AFI CD yet! Lead singer Davey Havok has the most vibrant and illuminating voice I've heard in a long time. This is a definate CD to buy as soon as possible, 12 tracks of extravagant music combined with a new-age style tone that you won't here from any other band online or offline. If you are a true AFI fan or you just started listening to them, this CD is the right choice!Christopher Horan,Jamestown, New York"
1,How can anyone listen to this garbage?,"I am almost positive that the AFI faithful will blast me for writing a review trashing Sing the Sorrow, but I can't sit back and listen to the hype machine tout this as the new face of rock, as if Bad Religion is handing the punk rock baton to these guys. This is not new. It is not the future of rock and it downright fails to entertain the listener. Havocs falsetto could not be more out of sync with this cartoon theater. Go pick up the Clash's first record or some early Misfits. This is Tim Burton light. And unfortunately it is less filling, and it doesn't taste that great."
1,The Second Coming of Christ,"I hate my generation. They just cannot let punk rock go, can they. 25 years ago, punk was a fresh and exciting genre. Now it is old and tired, very old and tired. It has become a type of music to be heard in a skate park. By the way, if you really want to be part of the excitement, pick some punk band concerned with style over substance (but that is extremely popular anyway) and worship them like they are the second coming of Christ, like AFI. Pretty Vacant."
1,I HATE AFI!!,Some of my friends used to like afi and bought some of their cds. I never liked them and after listening to a lot of their stuff(old and new)my mind had not changed. AFI is a terrible terrible band in every aspect. You can just tell by looking at them they suck. Goth punk? Please. Davey's ghastly voice combined with 3 other losers who obviously don't know what they're doing leads to some of the worst music of our generation.Probably my least favorite part is the lyrics.Girls not grey and Silver and cold are good examples of it.Your sins into me? What the hell is this? Needless to say I don't recommend any AFI music.
1,Without doubt the worst new band ..ever!!!,"Who ever sunk money into this bunch of fakersneed their heads lookin at.....and guess what...even a killer shot videowith the ""so mo"" jump work tryin to vibe up a bad songwill not sell shiitelock me up in a cell and blast Celine Dionfor a month....i'd be happier"
3,A Style Change,"Simply put, Davey has a terrific ""singing voice"" that we are accustomed to hear on small parts of his previous songs. However, the unique sound of his screaming that gives the energy in all his songs has been greatly reduced on this album. The songs are very catchy but they all resemble a mixture of songs like ""Morning Star"" with a ""Days of the Phoenix"" feel in them. These are both great songs, but I do miss his screaming. If you are a fan of AFIs previous work, then this CD may dissapoint you, but I'll tell you one thing, the hidden track has great meaning and purpose. It's one of those songs that you refer to when you get dumped or something drastic happens in your life."
2,Not what I expected,"AFI has been, to me, one of the few bands who actually improve with each successive album. Until now.The musicianship is good, but the songs are not nearly as good as on Black Sails in the Sunset and The Art of Drowning. It seems like they didn't have many ideas.Davey Havok's lyrics have reverted to the way he was writing when they made Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes. Everything is about hatred and anger and being poisoned and betrayed, blah blah blah. Apparently he still isn't over that. The negativity and hate is enough of a reason alone to not buy the album. There is very little that makes you feel good when listening to this CD. I could tolerate some questionable lyrics/messages with the last two albums, but this one opens with ""Love Your Hate!"" being repeated on the first track. Sorry, but I'm not a hateful person and do not associate with those who are. I don't think I'll be listening to AFI anymore."
3,Why must AFI sell out?,"I am/was a long-time AFI fan, but this album, with a completely different style of music, and Davey Havok singing to his up most potential, is like all the fans are gettin shat on by the band. They're on a new record label, and obviosly shooting for the big time, and selling out. I'm truely dissapointed."
5,EXCELLENT ALBUM,"This is the second copy I've bought because my first one disappeared, and if it disappeared again I would just be forced to buy another copy. It is a great album and definitely belongs in your collection. It's very different than their newer stuff, and VERY different from Blaqk Audio, but I think this is my favourite album that AFI has ever put out. Decemberunderground was... okay. And I haven't even bothered to listen to anything newer than that. But stop reading this right now, and go buy this album."
3,"""The Great Disappointment""","'Sing the Sorrow' isn't like A.F.I.'s previous work, it's more dragged out & depressing, not upbeat punk rock like they used to play. But, still it's an okay album. With a lot of haunting background vocals, the best way that I can describe them is like a dark Def Leppard.Honestly, if you're a fan of the old A.F.I. music, you will not like this album, unless you are more open toward their new style of music. However, with their success on 'Sing the Sorrow' A.F.I. has still maintained their cult-like feel.The best songs on this album are: ""The Leaving Song Pt. 2"", ""Bleed Black,"" ""Dancing Through Sunday,"" ""Death of Seasons,"" & ""Paper Airplanes (makeshift wings)."""
1,These guys shouldn't have made this cd,"... I bought this album thinking it would be their best yet. i listened it once and decided that i wasted my money and sold it the next day. The band has changed too much. They are not a screemo band like Thursday, they are a hardcore punk band with a straight edge lead singer. ... This album is not worth the money or the time it takes to download. I love AFI, just their old stuff. If this CD sounded like ""Black Sails In The Sunset"" or even ""All Hallows EP"" then i would have kept it. My suggestion, buy one of their older CD's and you will be alot happier. ..."
2,AFI's worst yet,"This is the worst cd I have ever heard. The vocals have not changed much, but pretty much everything else did. The fast paced guitars and deep growling bass's have been replaced with something that youd probably hear from bands like Saves the Day. Their music has gone from complex to simplistic, and thats what seperates the men from the boys. AFI has let all their former fans down with this cd, and I have high hopes for their next cd, if one ever comes out."
1,its a shame,"i really thought afi was one of the bands i could count on to stay faithful to punk rock and all it idealizes. they may have more complex songs, but they didn't have to side with the enemy to be able to do that. it's like being in an army, watching the enemy come charging toward you, and realizing that, when they get up close, they used to be fighting along side you. go make the big bucks playing to the mtv crowd, afi. we don't need you anymore."
2,overrated by half,"i bought the album on the strength of several solid reviews. mediocre at best. are they rock/punk? goth? industrial? not that the amalgamation matters as much as the fact they really have no sound of their own, and the songs are never particularily strong... you want this, go to sisters of mercy and rosetta stone first...."
1,The Downward Spiral,"AFI was never hardcore, and they are no longer punk. What started as a wonderful musical growth up until Art Of Drowning has now crossed the line into mainstream Hot Topic and MTV .... Here we've got Metallica basslines and campfire sing-a-longs. The backgroud vocals are weak, and the whole CD is overly programmed. For the first time in 6 releases, AFI has decided to DOUBLE-TRACK the guitars, and yet another great live band puts out a CD that they can't even play live. Also note, Sing the Sorrow is AFI's first CD off of Nitro Records, but where did they go? Sony. Give me a break. I'll take an Asking For It CD over anything A Fire Inside any day."
5,WOW!!,"When i first got this c.d., (yesterday) i had all ready LOVED girls not grey, but i wasn't so sure about the rest of the c.d., cause it had just come out. so i got home, expecting a lot of awesome PUNK stuff, but instead, it was more PUNK with a metal twist, and some techno beats mixed in there. I wasn't sure what to make of it. Now i've been listening to it NONSTOP all day today and yesterday, AND I LOVE IT!!! MUSICALLY, THESE GUYS ARE GENIOUS'!! PLEASE. . . PLEASE. . ., DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY THIS AWESOME C.D.!!!"
5,A.F.I. Has Their Own Style of Music,"This album is one you will not want to take out of your CD player. I have listened to it every chance I had for the past month. I love how they are different from your normal rock bands. Listen to this CD a few times, and you'll be hooked! Another great band is The Used."
5,Best AFI yet?,"I think that Sing the Sorrow is quite possibly the best AFI cd ever made. Even though it is slightly more mellow then most of the previouis cds, the lyrics and music are much more haunting and powerful. Perhaps the best song on the cd is the ""hidden"" track at the end. I have heard a lot of people say that AFI has sold out by signing on to Dreamworks and all i have to say is that if this is selling out more bands should do it. Thats how great the album is."
1,DO PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIKE THIS CRAP?,"Another fine example of the sad state that music is in.These 4 untalented losers have put out yet another crap album for their loser fans.MTV is responsible for all these cheesy numetal-punkgoth bands which are polluting young kids minds because they dont know any better.This is one of the worst and trendy bands which I cant stand and I wish they would retire already.My brother likes this crap band but that is because he is very young and influential.I need to school him on real music like black sabbath,iron maiden and sepultura.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!"
3,What is the big deal about AFI?!,"Almost everyone at my school loves AFI. I was eager to get their CD ""Sing the Sorrow"" because everyone says AFI is sooo cool! I am a big fan of all styles of music and I was expecting a new style of punk, all I got was gothic punk. I was very disappointed. The group is obviously obsesssed with the dark, because the lyrics are weird and the sound is way different. I mean I don't really hate the album, it's okay, but I just was expecting more. The songs that I did like were:""Girl's Not Grey"" ""Bleed Black"" ""The Leaving Song Pt.2""Those were the only good songs i enjoyed. THANK GOD I didn't pay 15 bucks for this and I only payed 7!A Disappointed Listener"
1,"worst cd ever, sorry to break the news for you all","this is possibly the worst album ive heard...aside from silver and cold,the rest of this album is pure GARBAGE! save your money, buy coheed, and be amazed by a band that is amazing"
4,My first ''AFI'' cd,"And totally not the last...^^I really love 'Bleed Black', 'Silver and Cold' and 'Girl's Not Grey' maybe because they are good to dance on.I was quit impress by 'Misera Cantare (the beginning)'and I found 'This Celluliod Dream' very catchy.The other ones are more screams than something else but they are good too [I mean if you like this type of music//like me (^__^)'---V ]"
5,This album is already legendary...,"I remember when I first heard this album - it was the first time I'd heard AFI before, but this was the first AFI record I ever owned. What more can one really say about it? It's just an absolute masterpiece. This band became legends when they released this album, and Gods when they released Decemberunderground. Both of them are probably the best rock albums that have come out in many years. ""Sing The Sorrow"" is flawless. Every song is great. One of the greatest albums ever recordeded."
2,Very annoying and depressing!,"I bought this CD because I heard AFI was a cool band and I had heard the song Days of the Phoenix on the radio and thought it was cool. One day I heard Girl's Not Grey and I loved it. Another thing that attracted me was the price it was very cheap for some reason, now I know why. This CD isn't even worth purchasing. It's got nothing good to it. If you want a good CD pick up Finch's ""What It Is To Burn"" or Coheed and Cambria's ""In Keeping the Secrets of Silent Earth: 3"" those are two CDs that are well worth your money. Don't waste your money!"
1,the great disappointment,"this album, with exception of ""death of seasons,"" is garbage. it's boring, generic, commercial, and nearly every other adjective required to make a successful commercial album. i'm not sure i could live with myself if i were responsible for releasing such swill into this world.what happened to these guys?"
1,Something went horribly wrong,"I went into this CD with a really positive outlook. I loved AFI and still do. I popped Sing the Sorrow into my CD player and began listening. I listened to it all the way through. I seriously tried to like the CD but just couldn't. Compared to 'Art of Drowning', 'All Hallow's' and 'Black Sails in the Sunset' this was just awful. I hope AFI can pull it together."
1,AFI is DONE,"Sing The Soorow is an over produced album that ruins everything they stand for. I am ashamed to own such an aweful CD. Davey voice was such an amzing thing they really helped them stand out against other bands but his screams have now been compared to the guy from Creed. AFI compared to Creed? That blows but its true. As a long time fan i am so dissapointed it really sounds like AFI at thi point are no longer doing it for the love of the music but the love of the money. For those who listen to AFI because its ""cool"" or if you like ""pop"" music this cd is for you. for old time AFI fans dont waste your time!"
2,And the mainstream claims another punk band....,"Let me get this out of the way first - the old AFI is gone. And, it is very likely that they will never come back. No more Black Sails At Sunset, no more All Hallow's E.P. The goth has finally taken over, and obscured almost every trace of punk and hardcore. The majority of this album sounds like a cross between bad-Cure imitation and watered-down Misfits. Every once in a while, a faint trace of the old AFI shines through, such as on ""This Celluloid Dream"" or ""Dancing Through Sunday"" but for the most part, Sing The Sorrow consists of a predictible combination of emo-goth wallowing and radio-friendly poppiness. If you're depressed and it's raining outside, this isn't a bad album to listen to, but otherwise, the content here is summed up by one of the song titles - ""The Great Disappointment."" Goodbye, AFI. I'll miss you."
5,One of their best albums in awhile,"It's really great and i think it had a lot of energy in it.One of their best albums in awhile, some of the newer ones (ex: art of drowning)were o.k but not great. The hidden track, was great, and the begin of it had such an eerieness to it, great song, the first song was great, every song was great on this c.d except for Girl's Not Grey. I do not like that song, and I think it is bad. That's all...Buy this c.d, ... great c.d"
3,Sing The Sorrow,"Being a ong time fan of AFI i was truly disappointed when i first heard STS. I thought it was a change for the worse. While it is a good album in genral, it is not good fr this once punk band. I personally belive that earler recordings, like ShutYour Mouth And Open Your Eyes were a lot better. But being such a long time fan of the band i will continue to spport them and everyone out there should by buying Sing The Sorrow. It is a good album to listen to at 3 in the morning."
5,definatly worth your time,wow is this cd good. i recommend this cd to anyone. when you buy it though make sure you listen to the bonus track it is really good as well. great job afi
2,"2 1/2 stars, and very disappointing","After two lightning fast and super albums, we were all expecting another speedster, another great album. Instead, we get this depressing music, i.e, The Leaving Song Pt. 2. The album does have a few high points, in that their riffs are more complex, but the songs are far slower and not all that good. Sure, Bleed Black may be more upbeat, but it lacks everything a good AFI song has. Silver and Cold has a decent chorus, but thats it. Now then, the one amazing song on the album, is DANCING THROUGH SUNDAY. AFI's best song in my opinion, and one of my favorite songs of all time. The riffs are just great, and more complex than ever before, and the highlight of course, comes with the stellar solo, a great solo. The rest album is generally the same thing except for Paper Airplanes, another good song. Don't get this album unless you are a diehard AFI fan."
5,Really great cd!!!,"Wow man, this is one of the best CDs i have ever bought. If you thought the Art of Drowning is a good cd then you will definetly like this cd. Maybe it is a tad bit more mellow than the Art of Drowning but it is just as great. I just bought the cd today and i have the feeling that it will be in my CD player for a pretty long time."
4,la la la.... I can't hear you,"uhm...this cd..isn't one of AFI's best. I agree with some of the previous reviewers in that this cd is NOT as as edgy and raw as their previous albums. at least it's not completely [bad] though.Miseria Cantare and Bleed Black are decent efforts...Girl's Not Grey is fun and damn catchy despite sounding like something any punk band could have produced. all that I can tell you is to try and not be dissappointed. if you don't like this album, then just put Very Proud of Ya or Black Sails In The Sunset on and be reminded of the days when those were the only two cds you listened to...or just make a giant AFI playlist and listen to that for a very long time after listening to this cd."
5,The Darkness calms your soul,"This by far is the greatest cd that AFI has ever made,.. so far...it has everything from flyng guitar solo's to powerful chorus's...the overall power of this cd is un heard of....if your into afi..get this cd....and let the darkness calm your soul"
4,AFI is basically the Cure on this one.,"It's not a bad cd, but it's not quite what I was expecting. They'r really not Punk anymore, which is somewhat good, and somewhat bad. Sing the Sorrow reminds me a lot of the Cure's Pornography.Maybe I would have liked it better had I not heard old AFI first. But it's most definetly worth picking up."
5,the best cd of 03,"ok first thing this has to be the best cd of 2003. From start to finsh every song on this cd is really good. it starts of with a kinda of errie type melody. but as the cd goes on it becomes really punkish. this cd has really impressed me i just started listening to afi about 3-4 months ago when i heard ""art of drownding"" and now ""sing the sorrow"" they are a complete band good lyrics and great skill. if you havent heard this cd you are missing out even if your not a big punk fan just check it out you will be impressed. start off with ""girls not grey"" it is a little slower so you kinda get a punk feel. then try ""dancing though sunday"" a really hard song anyway you will get the idea though the best way is from the ""beginning"" to the end. if you miss this cd youll miss out checkem out"
4,Another Great AFI Album,"Yeah sure AFI might have gone out onto mainstream radio and all that with this album, but it's still a great cd. No matter what AFI will always be a great band. This album shows how much they've grown since their days of the Hard Core East Bay scene. The only reason I am giving this album only a 4 is because I still think The Art Of Drowning is their best album. I can listen to this cd over and over and not get sick of it. Every song is good. I definatly recomend it."
2,WHAT HAPPENDED,"All real hardcore AFI fans will probably hate this album. I don't even now what to say. ... I still personally love their old stuff way better. Its to bad that another one of my favorite bands has left the underground to try to make it big, with so much [bad] music coming out of the so called punk scene,now that punk is in style. Dreamworks deos kill good music as one reveiwer said."
4,"different, but rocking as always!","Sing The Sorrow is very different from AFI's previous albums...this one has more of a gothicy, techno sound. Some of the tracks sound more mainstream than, for example, Clove Smoke Catharsis. AFI have evolved into something completely different than when they first started out, but they have only gotten better. Davey's voice sounds more grown-up, but still familiar. I'd recommend this album to AFI, Placebo, Misfits, and Anti-Flag fans."
5,Yay New AFI,Great cd. Very Different from their older stuff but still awesome. Davey's lyrics are as always amazing. I've listend to this cd for days straight and I'm still not sick of it!
4,not my kind of music,I think that it is funny that whenever a band gets talent and starts doing something elseand gets some talent somehow they have sold out and suck. This music is ok 4 stars just for being differnt.
2,No longer punk,"For their first three full length album, AFI were an up and rising punk band. They started off as high school students that formed a garage band as a Misfits tribute. Now, they have landed their music onto mainstream radio and have drastically changed their style of music. I admit that a few of the songs, such as: Dancing through Sunday, Paper Airplanes, and This Celluloid Dream, are catchy, but they don't sound anything like classics such as: Rizzo in the Box, File 13, or This Secret Ninja. Sadly, they are now just another band that sold out."
3,Not as good as the older A.F.I. cds...,"This cd surprised me. It was the first A.F.I. cd I had gotten. I think Davey Havok has an incredible voice range. Soon after I began listening to the older cds such as Very Proud of Ya, and I liked them much better. This is a good cd, if you like angry singing. They sort of remind me of a male Alanis Morissette. (Don't as why...) I recommend it though."
5,AFI Satisfies with Major Label Debut,"With possibly the most anticipated album over the last several years, AFI makes its major label debut with Sing the Sorrow, a record that will both bring in new fans and not leave longtime fans disappointed. In fact, they will be blown away with this beautiful masterpiece of melodic driving guitars and amazingly intense vocals. Track #5 even includes a powerful guitar solo, finally giving Jade a chance to show his prowess on the guitar. Fears that a major label release would cause AFI to sound much more produced were completely unfounded as this record fits perfectly into the amalgam of AFI releases. And there IS a secret track. Get this record NOW!!!"
5,A Great CD from a great band,"In the U.K, it is hard for people to find bands. Until we had satellite tv installed recently, i thought punk bands were blink 182 and greenday. However, music channels on Sky introduced me to AFI. When I first saw their video for girls not grey I was impressed. Then I bought the Transplants album, and Davey does guest vocals on the track ""Quick Death,"" so i decided this may be some good punk rock that i was missing out on.It truly was. Since buying sing the sorrow i have listened to it almost religiously every day. The band display a lot more maturity than most of the mainstream punk bands, and there sound is different. There are some great guitar riffs and solo's, and Davey Havocks voice seems to sound great over about 3 octave's and even when he's doing his screaming.A great rock CD from a great Rock Band, I have already purchased another 2 of AFI's albums since hearing this and am looking forward to future albums and gigs by them"
4,Sing the Sorrow,"Sing the Sorrow was the first AFI album I have ever purchased, and I am thoroughly impressed. The boys mix driven guitars with screaming (and sometimes chanting) vocals and beautiful lyrics. Standouts on the album are ""Miseria Cantare"", ""Bleed Black"", and ""Girl's Not Grey""."
5,Classic AFI CD,This CD will blow you away...very different compared to previous AFI albums but definitely one of their best albums EVER.
3,Pretty Good....,This CD is pretty good but I don't really like all the ambient stuff. It's cool technically and everything but I just prefer Black Sails or Art of Drowning of this.
4,"Bull, everyone is wrong.","Everyone who is not liking this Cd for reasons becuase it is not punk or not, that is [bs] and they are seriously wrong . nobody, not even i, know what is pure punk-rock and anyone who claims to know it other than people who grew up in that era is well (to put it in all uses the the word) A POSER. you have no idea what ""punk"" or ""punk rock"" is.So to say that AFI's new CD isn't enough punk for someone that is wrong. They were going for a new style, a new sound, a new something. who cares if it isn't like there other stuff, they were trying to go for that sound and those riffs and those beats.But hey, like what you like. Overall. its a good Cd. and yes, it does have its bad moments but it also has some very good songs. and i do agree that it isn't the best CD by AFI becuase some are superbly better. But it does deserve some recognition as a CD by AFI. hehe. yeah. AFI ROCKS!"
5,this album rocks,this album is really good. daveys voice is so amazing his lyrics are chilling. i think everyone should go buy this album. their music is really inspiring. one of the best bands ive ever heard..up there with BAD RELIGION..
5,Best Punk Cd ever made,"Sing the Sorrow is the best cd made by AFI period. I have never listened to something so great in my entire life. I have all of the AFI cds, they are all fantastic but Sing the Sorrow really stands out as the greatest. Their sound has really changed over the years and this time it was for the best. My favorite songs are The Leaving song part 2, girls not grey, and paper airplanes. This is the champion of punk cds and will always be. So take my advice and spend a little money to by a lifetime of enjoyment."
5,Different... but in a pleasing way.,"Admittedly, Sing the Sorrow is a lot more mainstream then The Art of Drowning and Black Sails in Sunset, both in sound and success. But, don't let the fact that ""Girls Not Grey"" and ""Siver and Cold"" have been played excessively on MTV and the like turn you off to AFI's latest album.Sing the Sorrow starts out with ""Miseria Cantare (The Beginning)"" which is sure to get your blood pumping as it moves into ""The Leaving Song, Pt. 2"" which has also made its' way onto the airwaves. ""Bleed Black"" has an addictive beat, but the lyrics are sure to keep your mind reeling as ""Silver and Cold"" follows on its' heels. The rest of the CD is equally as impressive, though like I said, it's more mainstream-resembling than the previous albums.Personal favorites: ""...But Home is Nowhere,"" ""Bleed Black,"" and ""This Time Imperfect"". ^^*"
5,Great CD!,"Although I have always been into heavier music than this, I like this cd and the group in general. Their music is original and has a good feel to it creating a unique atmosphere. I also like this cd more than The Art of Drowning which I know is treason to some A.F.I. fans. Anyway get this and enjoy it!"
4,Not your typical pop-punk album,"This is a unique sounding pop-punk album not like anything i've heard before (and i mean that, ive read some reviews calling simple plan unique for crying out loud). It's one of those albums that take me a long time to realise how good it actually was. I got it after hearing Girl's not Grey on the radio, listened to it maybe twice, then not again for months. Every now and again i would put it, but never did it strike me as being a masterpiece. That was until i went through a phase with nofx. I started gathering nofx albums and albums from similar bands and again i put sing the sorrow into my stereo. To my disbelief i was listening to some of the greatest music i had ever heard, i can't understand why it never struck me earlier as being a classic. My fav songs are 2,3,4,6,10 and 12 (these ones are more melodic). The album also has a couple of songs which sound like they are from previous albums (5 and 9 in particular). I love the eerie intro as well."
1,"Finally, it hath arrived...","another boring ""underground"" rock album. I guess A.F.I. got tired of ripping off the Misfits so they decided to rip off every other 'screamo' band out there. These guys wear suits, they MUST be hip and different, and they have X's on their hands, like they just got back from a show. Wow, that means they have a wide range of influences.Jesus, at least that goth chick that's their lead singer is hot...Oh crap, that's a dude."
1,Deserves no stars. Contrived nonsense.,"The fact that these guys are compared to the Misfits is outrageous. This stuff is on par with Yellowcard, New Found Glory, or any other pop punk emo crappola that is currently so popular. Davy Havok is an androgenous homo who whines about stuff that appeals to wussie thirteen year old kids. Anyone with two brain cells to rub together should know better than to listen to this garbage."
2,Better with age,"AFI has always been my favorite band. I couldn't wait for there new album. When i got it for chritmass i couldn't wait to listen to. I poped it in and I thought...""WHAT HAPPEND""? There older music was so much better. The fast pasted signing and the rebelious lyrics mand them awsome. But Sing the Sorrow was slow and stupid. They need to go back to what made them great."
4,"On its own--a good album, but it not AFI---this is a sellout album","If this album was by any other band, I'd be praising them, but this isnt what AFI used to sound like--this album is soo generic. I can't get riled up to this like i can to ""Black Sails in the Sunset"" or ""The Art of Drowning""It's one thing when you're just another band changing your style---but AFI had such a strong and loyal following, that they just stabbed in the back with this pop-culture-influenced album."
3,Me again.,Btw: so what if they signed to a major label: is that really that wrong that they went to a place that has 1. better recording quality 2. pays them a crapload more than an indie label and 3. has a BIG producer pushing them to the max? No. It's not wrong at all.
3,"AFI, Isn't The Band They Where.","This CD Is Okay. Im More Into There Old Stuff When They Where A Hardcore Band, I Dont Think There That Good Now, They Seem A Lot Like A Emo Band Now And It's Definitly Not Good. It Made Me Mad To See Them Sell Out, I Heard Now There On Kids Bop...This Upsets Me. This Album Is Okay Nothing Special. I Think It's Composed Well, But It's All Too Deep. And Trust Me This Is Far Too Deep. This Isn't The Worst AFI CD But It Definitly Isn't The Best Either. They Are My Favorite Band Still Nonetheless, Well Them And Cephalic Carnage. Yeah I Recomend Shut Your Mouth And Open Your Eyes or Black Sails In The Sunset."
5,BRILLIANT!!!!,"This is a work of pure genius! Davey Havok and Jade Puget collaborated to bring song lyrics that are attuned to the deepest recesses of the soul. The singing style of frontman Davey Havok is more accomplished than AFI's earlier albums in the sense of his wider, more powerful vocal range. From the beautiful melodies of ""The Great Disappointment"", ""Silver and Cold"" , the two ""Leaving Songs Part I and Part II"" to the powerful ballads of ""Death of Seasons"" and ""Bleed Black"", one can see a huge progression in AFI's musical career. Even hints of heavy metal can be heard. The solid, supportive bass lines and drums of Hunter and Carson bring this album into unity . This is true, darkly beautiful rock n roll. When you buy this record be sure to study the lyrics; Sing the Sorrow has underlying messages that may be missed if you don't follow along the first few plays. This album has touched me in such a profound way and for that I am truly greatful!"
3,Good but not so good,I have been listening to AFI and going to their shows since around their second cd. This album so's a direct reflection of the new label. The music is good but it has always been good. The singing does not sound like afi what so ever except in a couple songs. Bottom line is half is good and some [not so good]. Whoever says that labels don't influence a band; don't know what the hell they are talking about ex. they have somebody scratching in some of their songs. They do deserve the success but I wish they would have kept their sound a little more.
3,Where did they go?,"Yeah, i used to LOVE AFI. I was obsessed. But now i've moved on to My Chemical Romance, after AFI dissapeard. Where are they? Did they release a new album that i just completely missed since Sing the Sorrows? They were cool, and they had like 2 music videos and won that MTV2 award. Then, they were gone. Maybe its just me and i didnt follow them carefully enough. But, still......."
5,You need to buy this CD!!,This has to be the best AFI cd ever. I was stunned the first time I heard this CD. Its unbeleivable. If you have never heard AFI before you need to get this or any other CD by AFI. You will not regret it.
3,decent enough.,"Ok, this should be more like 2.5 stars, halfway between terrible and good.I'm a fan of Black Sails/All Hallows EP/Art Of Drowning era AFI, where Davey actually shouted the lyrics like any hardcore band does. On this release it sounds like he's trying to sing, but he can't quite give up shouting, so it comes off as more of a forced whine. The lyrics on AFI's previous cds were dark, but they weren't forced at all, whereas it's almost as if Davey tried to make Sing The Sorrow's lyrics as cheesy as possible.In the end, it's Jade, Hunter and Adam who save this cd from being totally horrible. Jade's punk metal guitar attack, Hunter's darkly funky bass playing and Adam's drumming create something really cool.In the end, cool music, but Davey sort of brings the album down. See them live, but carpe diem, cause AFI fanatics are very annoying."
3,ok,"this is an ok cd. theres just something in it that just really doesnt you know its like kinda music like it's ok. its an ok band but you know when i bought this cd girls not grey was the only single out and that song kicked ass!!!!!!the leaving song part 2 is a good song 2. like not that i hate this album its just that not my taste really. i like bands like green day, new found glory, blink 182, alternative stuff like that but if your in to metllica, guns and roses, marlin manson stuff like that this cds for you.not that i hate those bands except for marlin manson hes kreepy but those bands there just not that taste for me."
1,"The Next Offspring, Only Worse","Okay, what happened. AFI was one of the great hardcore bands of the nineties and they went down this path. Say it isn't so! (...). The album's not that great either. From the song ""Girl's Not Gray"" which borders the line between pop-punk/pop (don't ask me to explain), and the rest of the album follows in its footsteps.I H-A-T-E this album. Its the worst thing that could happen to an old school fan like me. It saddens me that AFI could go down this path. So drop this album and buy Very Proud of You or Answer That and Stay Fashionable. You'll be happier, trust me (unless you like Good Charollote, then you'll probably love this friggin' album!)"
1,Stay away from this turgid mess,"An album rating of a half star generally denotes a retaliatory rating with no thought. And if there is a review, it will generally be: ""THIS BAND SUXORS YEA BLACK SABBATH."" But in this case, I am serious in declaring AFI's Sing the Sorrow one of the most sonically offensive listening experiences I have ever had the pleasure of enduring. Perhaps what is most infuriating about this group is how they are portrayed as hardcore saviors, punk-rawk machines who can and will save modern music - because really, this is sub-sub-sub-sub-everything else poor pop-punk with mascara on. I understand and appreciate that this stuff appeals to some, but if you think like me you should avoid this record like the clap."
4,Still a pretty good album ...........,"Wow the very first thing that struck me the first couple of times I listened to this album was how much afi have progressed over the last decade or so ..... Being a huge fan of Afi I have all their albums but Sing the sorrow is so different it totally suprised me ....Everyone has slated them for changing but I think its totally for the better the songs contained on this album are so much more intricate then say songs from "" Shut your mouth and open your eyes "" or "" Answer that and stay fashionable "" ... So my advice to you is to give it a couple of listens trust me if your a core afi fan the album will grow on you eventually ... The best tracks on the album include - Silver and cold , The leaving song part 1 ,But home is nowhere , and the best song on the album is undoubtably the hidden track at the very end "" this time imperfect"""
5,"Deep, Dark, Depressing, And Awesome!","This is so damn dark and awesome that you can't pass it up! No matter what you think about dark and depressing music, you must have this cd, because it will make you appreciate it!"
4,strong step in a new direction,"I've been through the album a few times now and at first I was kinda thrown askew by the new type of sound. I was turned off by what seemed like a step back from AOD. But don't get discouraged. After you really take this album in you'll find it pretty damn amazing. The band sure has taken a new direction, and the music has matured much. Davey's got quite a scream now, I'm proud and you would be too. Def. check out ""Death of Seasons"" it is by far the best song."
5,tracks,i recommend the new AFI sing the sorrow to everyone the lyrics are so deep and it gives you chills! they really did a good job.
5,They Made it All Come Together,"I heard everything posers have had to say like they sold out but I think they don't fit into any music group I think they made their own music genre like nirvana. I've been listening to AFI since 95 and never gotten tired of them and my bro has been listening to them longer then me and loves sing the sorrow. I think combined a bunch of rock genres like hardcore and catchiness rock other genres and made it sound like nothing I've ever heard and it sounds awesome who ever thinks this is emo,poppy,or really stupid can shut up and go to hell."
5,Wow Perfect Cd Buy It Now It's Great,"This cd is great David adds his vocals to great guitar and drum parts in the songs. The Best Songs (by a small amount) are ""Leaving Song Part II"", ""Girls Not Grey"", ""Leaving Song"", and ""...But Home Is Nowhere"". If you like hardcore, great screaming vocals, or just plain like AFI, you'll love this cd. Buy It. Perfect composition."
4,Definatly Exceeded my Expectations,"I never really got into AFI at all before. I figured they were just an emo band, and since I'm not a fan of that genre I just passed them off. When a friend played ""The Leaving Song Pt. 2"" for me I liked it a lot and decided I would check out some of their other songs. This album amazed me so much. While they are thrown into the punk/emo/whatever genre they are really an original band that stands out. The songs on this album are great and it's the type of album that I can just let play straight through. Definatly a good job on this album."
5,An Incredible C.D.,"I first heard of A.F.I. on the radio and knew nothing about their indy career. When I first heard ""Girl's not Grey"" I thought it wa good, but not great. Then ""The Leaving Song Part 2"" came out and I loved that song. I had to get the c.d. I listened to it, and it was good. But, I kept going back to it and soon I was absolutley hooked. I listen to it 2 to 3 times a day. My favorite song is ""This Time Imperfect"" which is hidden at the end. I love Davey's singing voice and his screaming voice. The lyrics are deep and really well written. I really can't put AFI into a specific genre. They uniquely mix punk rock with electronics, but it also has a dark, almost gothic feel. This is my all time favorite c.d. Can't wait to hear more."
2,Not Quite,"I'm not sure what to say about this album. I don't hate it. I don't love it. It's still AFI, but it's different. I don't even care about the ""major label"", but now I think that did affect their music. It's AFI with a twist. They added stuff to make their music fit on the radio and on MTV. I bet I'd love the CD if they stayed original. In ""Death Of Seasons"" they added a techno beat in the middle! Whats up with that? AFI is not a pop-techno band. At least they didn't used to be. Can't they see that they're selling out?My advice to you is to listen to AFI. All the time. But don't buy this CD. Listen to the other stuff. Their other CDs. I love this band. I don't love what they're doing now. I'm really sad they're doing this. Offspring did it too with Conspiracy Of One. The bands don't sound like they used to. It's sad."
4,"i like melodic,so you hard punkers think u r hard guys?","i like this album, every song is cool...is easy listening, the old stuff i have listen is ok also but this is better.."
4,Good album,"A.F.I.'s Sing the Sorrow is a great album. I would describe their music as a new and intersting hybrid: goth-punk. I bought this CD because I heard their song 'Girl's Not Grey' on the radio and I liked their sound. If you like that song you will like the rest of the album becuase they maintain the same atmosphere. Their music is crisp, memorable and interesting. They have a real sense of music instead of mindless axe grinding like other bands. Thier lead singer has a haunting, tragic and angst-ridden voice that goes well with their origional music."
2,sing the sorrow=sad story,"i was a big fan of AFI prior to the release of 'sing the sorrow'. their jump to mainstream has totally influenced their music in an MTV sort of way. one song even has a techno-ish interlude. i'd say there are two, maybe three songs worth listening to for the true AFI fan. if you wanna catch them in their prime, go buy 'black sails' or 'art of drowning'. 'shut your mouth' is really good too. but 'sing the sorrow'? all i can say is they shoulda stuck it out with Nitro."
2,Ehhh..,"I got this CD from my friend for my birthday, but I really don't like it that much. I've given it a chance and I think it's boring. All of the songs just drown together. I could be listening to this CD for 20 minutes and be thinking, ""This is a really long song. When will the 2nd song start..?"" The only time I can hear a difference between the songs are if it is a song I have heard on the radio like ""Girls Not Grey"" or ""Silver and Cold."" Sing the Sorrow hasn't been in my CD player for months."
1,AFI = Must be for 14-16 year olds.,"With all the talk about AFI and the abundance of news surrounding them, it's hard not to wonder what they sound like. So I picked up this cd and gave it a shot all the way through and I must say this is one of the worst things I have heard in the past few years. The music is lame, the singer sounds like a whiny emo girl, and the whole goth thing? Music has reached an all time LOW."
4,"AFI is amazing, but.......","Alright, AFI is one of the greatest bands ever. All of their albums deserve 5+ stars, but Sing the Sorrow falls a little short. I'm not saying it is bad, as a matter fact it is really good. It has its high points (Silver and Cold, The Leaving Song, etc.) and its low points (Girls not Grey). They have become lighter in order to appeal to a broader audience, which they shouldn't have. If AFI would of released this as their first album, it would be amazing, the only problem, is that its not. Check out Black Sails in the Sunsaet or The Art of Drowning before this.Also, all of you who started listen to AFI when this album came out and haven't listened to any other albums and are saying about how great it is, don't talk. Go listen to their older stuff first and then maybe i'll listen to you.To sum up, its a pretty good album, but not as good as i was hoping, hence the 4 stars."
5,the sixth album. possibly the best.,"Afi have seen past the days of their hardcore and punkyness in this album. they are heading towards the side of goth in their goth-punk catagory. this is an incredible album. i have long awaited this album, and i am not dissapointed one little bit.its a little diferent than their old stuff like 'proud of ya' and 'the art of drowing', but each album they have made is a little diferent. its one of their best, so go get it and find that out for your self."
5,a sweet cd,this was the best cd i have ever heard! i would recomend it to anyone who likes good music. or at least has good taste in music.
2,AFI in general,"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!! i was shocked when i heard this cd after i bought it. i saved up all my money and i was excited for afi's new cd. and i was [ticked] off. this cd was terrible. i knew change was coming with afi like all bands, but this was unexpected. songs like ""girls not grey"" are just boring radio-tunes. and this cd just doesn't compare to afi's older work...dreamworks records, is it all for the money. your not a big name band, do it for the fans. i suggest that afi go rediscover their former selves, cause sing the sorrow isn't acceptable to go along with all of their older work."
4,another masterpiece,"it is really disappointing when people always look for negatives to point out. if this exact album was released on nitro records instead of dreamworks everyone's reviews would say this is a.f.i's best album yet. i have been listening to a.f.i. for quite some time, and i don't hear anything in this album that leads me to think that they have changed their philosophy or style since moving to a larger label. the songs are still upbeat and have very memorable chorus'. the reason that i am only giving the album 4 stars is because it is not quite as good as ""the art of drowning"". instead of being so critical of these guys try being proud of them for getting some long overdue exposure.standout songs: leaving song pt. II, dancing through sunday, and girl's not grey"
3,Ouch..,"I really love these guys...and honestly...hearing this album hurt. I was so excited to hear what new changes they were making to their sound but never had I imagined that it would be this drastic!Their once original sound has turned now more into a blend of Simple Plan and New Found Glory and other generic bands of the like. I wish I could be saying something better, but in all honety,its not AFI. However,putting that aside the album isn't horrible...its just not what I was expecting.I'm hoping it will grow on me."
5,Best Ever,"Sing the Sorrow has everything an AFI fan could want. From searing guitar riffs and pounding drums to Havok's tortured vocals carrying AFI's most profound lyrics ever, such as Death of Season's ""writing with sickness, thrown into banality, I decay"" and Bleed Black's ""I'm hovering throughout time. I crumble in these days"". Sing the Sorrow is AFI's most provocative release. Punk fans will not be disappointed."
5,Astounding,"The starting track for AFI (A Fire Inside)'s newest cd is perhaps not the best thing that they've ever done, but you soon forgive them for that (the intro's only a mere 2:49 afterall), when they burst through the second track, THE LEAVING SONG, PART II.(Why they chose to play The Leaving Song II before Part I is purely obvious, it's perhaps one of the band's best songs!And each song keeps getting better and better, there are no weak tracks, and simply put - this is the band's most substancial album from start to end.It's something that DEMANDS to be heard - period.I was not a HUGE fan of the band before this album, but was not a hater either -I just did not own any of their albums, and did not see myself buying them in the future.I'm happy to say now, however that I own every single and album that this band has produced.Buy this now."
5,The Best so far from A.F.I.,"Many fans of A.F.I. may be shocked when first hearing their new release ""Sing the Sorrow""....keep listening! From the Romanisque marching sounds of ""Miseria Cantare"" to the final quiet notes of ""...but home is nowhere"", Sing the Sorrow gives the listener the full package. Die hard punkers will throw their fists in the air to ""Death of Seasons"" and Emo kids will scream ""Follow"" when ""Girl's Not Grey"" comes on. Do yourself a big favor, buy this CD and pickup a ticket to the Vans Warped Tour to checkout these guys or you'll miss out on everything that's cool. Punk isn't dead...it just [is bad] right now...except for A.F.I.!"
5,"awesome, despite what some may say.","Alright, here's the deal. No, this album doesn't sound anything like their other stuff, but they're experimenting with new things, which every artist should do. But that's not a bad thing...this album is absolutely awesome...and to anyone with an open mind, I suggest it."
3,decent,i'm gonna give this cd 3 1/2 stars...i actually bought this cd and when i did i really liked it but now nto soo much they defitnitly did change there sound and i liked it alot better before..damn sell outs..i recommend art of drowning.
2,A more pleasant type of 'sorrow',"Although this isn't an album I would proclaim to be one of my all-time favorites, it's nice to listen to. Two-and-a-half stars would be more accurate, but I do not have the liberties to give albums halves. :) At times, Davey Havoc is difficult to understand because his voice can get extremely nasaly. As far as standouts, I especially like the intro track along with the singles: ""Girl's Gone Grey"", ""The Leaving Song Part II"", and ""Silver And Cold"". Many of the others are unmemorable and just boring. I wouldn't recommend this entire album."
2,Mediocre,"This album is just alright. There are a few good songs, but most of the songs sound too much alike. The vocals can get annoying after listening to them for a while. In my opinion the best song on this CD is probably Silver and Cold."
5,excellent album,"AFI are best known for variety and being unique, and that's what this album is. It's fresh and is on a higher level than Art of Drowning. This album is aptly named Sing the Sorrow...there is a great cello part that is brought in that amplifies the melancholy. There is a mad guitar riff in Dancing Through Sunday, and Death of Seasons has an extremely unprecedented AFI sound. All of the songs incorporate the best elements of AFI and have improved upon them. Davey's voice has improved as well...this is a great album and I've been listening to it nonstop ever since I bought it. 5 stars!"
5,AFI ROCKS,"Yea, i love the entire cd. it was great. every song had meaning and emotion and you felt all the right emotions at the right time. One of my favorite tracks on the cd is the hidden one. its about 9 mins. in so look for that one"
4,Different = Poor? I think not,"After buying this album and listening to it in its entirety, I was left with a sense of surprise. Owning all of the other AFI albums, I immediately realized that this one was much different. As with any good punk band (i.e NOFX, The Misfits, Tiger Army), the beginning albums have a hardcore sound w/ let's admit it, fairly juvenile lyrics. Not that this is bad, but as the band, in this case AFI, progresses, the sound is bound to change into something much more refined and mature. Sing the Sorrow is full of really awesome songs and more than any other of their albums, shows not only their instrumental, buy lyrical talent. If you're an AFI fan, this is worth every penny."
3,1 slight glitch.,"This CD launched my interest in rock and was the only CD in my stereo for 4 months. I got my serving of AFI three times daily until I began to tire of it, and I laid it aside for 8 months. I picked it up again this week, and I was appalled. The voice that had once struck me as almost operatic--davey sure can hit those high notes--has degraded to an annoying whine. This album is perfect--lyrics, instrumentals..but I can't listen to it anymore, his voice...it's just too annoying!"
4,Great CD but not that great,"This is easily one of the best cd's of 2003 if not the best.But compared to other great AFI hits like The Art of Drowning and Black Sails into the Sunset.Some songs in this cd are very weak.Like This Celluloid Dream and Silver and Cold. The only reason you know its afi is becuase of Davey's voice.I recomend getting the UK version with the bonus track Synthesthesia and Now the World.Those songs are pretty good.Summary:Good cd but compared to othe afi cd's, not that good.but still go out and get it."
4,didnt feel like signing in....,"The music on this is great....but just several months ago,it was really weird...whenever i listened to it i got the worst headache(and it wasnt from the loudness), and right after the headache came the worst cold couple of colds i ever had....this happened at least 3 times, now i just have given up on it....but its a great album....seriously i thought davey wassa chick...oh well"
3,What ever happened to east bay hardcore?,"A Fire Inside, east bay hardcore...don't make me laugh. If you've read the whole ""summary of afi's past"" thats listed on here, forget what you read. AFI IS the past, this new stuff shouldnt even be considered AFI. I won't deny that I still listen to STS, it's not a bad cd, but it doesnt compare to the past, in fact it's not the same kind of music at all. You can't go out and buy STS or AOD and claim to be a punk...because it is no longer punk music. I dont claim to be punk myself I think everyone looks retarded in their skin tight jeans and studded/patched leather coats. Instead of rambling about nothing like every other true AFI fan, if you gonna fire out $15 for an AFI cd, get shut your mouth and open your eyes, and all hallows ep, its cheap and probably the best, then continue to build your collection around those for they are true AFI and a must have not just for AFI fans, but for everyone."
2,"Unlike other Korman books, not one I'd likely re-read","Most of Korman's works, especially those in the MacDonald Hall series, as well as most others focusing on slightly older characters, have the endearing characteristic of being simply written and furiously funny, allowing for appreciation on many levels. Not so with 'Why Did the Underwear Cross the Road', and other attempts to chronicle pre-adolescent life.Even at their age I found it difficult to identify with any of the characters in such books, and now, several years since, I am still decidedly reluctent to re-read these books, although I routinely re-read such classics as 'Losing Joe's Place' or 'This Can't be Happening at MacDonald Hall'. Do yourself a favor. Buy one of his better books, or if you are in the situation where I was when I read this book, having already read just about all of the rest of Gordon Korman's stuff, find another author. Might I suggest Jules Verne? Very good stuff, and quite timeless I might add."
3,Mediocre Book,"This book has good ideas and presents a basic outlay of marketing on the web. Like a lot of other books on this subject, the promises are a bit thick while the meat is a bit thin. There's a lot of small details this book misses. Instead, the book mentions this principals, but the implementation is up to you. This book also gets reduced another star for being dated. Written in 1995, in the infancy of the web, a lot has changed now. This book misses important tactics needed today. Also, it devles into other tactics that were appropiated in the early days of the web that are not applicable today. This book picks some of the low hanging fruit that was available back then, relying upon their uniqueness for their success. Try these same ideas today, and they're old and stale."
5,Transitions in the Lives of Women,"I gave The Leap Years at Christmas to several friends and relatives. One wrote me that she took her copy to the edge of the Grand Canyon on the eve of the millennium and sat in the snow as she read, her feet dangling over the edge. Another friend took her copy to the gym, sat on an exercise bike, tears rolling down her face, as she read ""On Loving Ethan."" Hope, pain, risk, loss, transition, and love are a few of the themes embraced in this collection of nonfiction by thirty women of all ages and cultures. ""Running Woman"" and ""Toast"" made me shout with laughter while ""The Night Ahead"" brought quiet tears of empathy for the author and her mother. After reading this book I am even more respectful of women's resilience when confronted with change, loss, and love."
2,Not worth the price of admission!,"I think this book does help for people who need to do labs and do not have windows 2k pro or server software. BUT, some of the labs are inane and there are not enough of them to constitute the ...price tag. Hopefully in their next reincarnation of this book/cd-rom, they add in more sims and exam prep question(which there are none of) to justify their price tag."
1,This movie sucks,"I can't express how disappointed I am with this movie. It is inaccurate, and in my opinion, another hollywood flop in the serial killer genre. I've read quite a bit about BTK and this movie omits the beginning of his career as a serial killer. The movie starts way after the original killings that occured in the 70's, and doesn't touch on his days at ADT or his beginnings. The acting is horrible, and the star protraying b.t.k. is hard to look at because of his neck and how odd he looks. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
2,JASON TRIES TO ACT,"TV's AMERICAN JUSTICE did this better. There's little truth in this, other than Rader's capture. None of the real victims are used; production values are terrible and Kane Hodder needs to stick to his non-speaking Jason Voorhees roles.Nothing to recommend here."
1,Horrible!,"i rented this movie thinking it would be a good insight into the BTK case that i followed through the news..BOY WAS I WRONG.acting was horrible, along with dialouge and overall direction. a classroom of sixth graders could have made a better movie than this. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED!its not worth the price on here, its worth more like 50 cents!don't waste your time with this one!"
2,COLOR DISCREPENCY,"""AMBER"" WAS ON THE PACKAGE HOWEVER THE COLOR WAS A WASHED OUT YELLOW. AFER A COUPLE OF DAYS IT TURNED WHITE AND HAS STAYED THAT WAY."
4,"Easy, Entertaining Read!","Really no slow spots in this book. Keeps your interest and you never know what will happen next. Recommended for anyone (including adult) over 12 (okay, maybe 10). Nice series. Now want to read the rest of the series."
4,A Really Exciting Book,"This book was really interesting and deals with the same characters as the last book. It is an exciting cliff-hanger and a really good read. The first impression you may get of the book is kind of weird but after reading just a little bit of it, you get used to the style and the characters. You even start to like some unexpected and different characters! I would really recomend it to anyone who likes adventure and action books."
4,Good Read,Enjoyed it but thought that it was not as good as the first. I will still read the 3rd installment in the series and see if I want to go onto the #4 from there.
4,Entertaining,A continuation of the first book. The second book draws on and expands information on the first book while remaining a seperate entity. A whimsical romp for those that enjoyed book one.
4,Prophecy fo Bane,Enjoyed this book even though it is mainly a young adult book. I am looking forward to reading the next installment. I enjoy Suzanne Collins style of writing.
4,"A great middle-grade, to YA, fiction series","I remain a stalwart Suzanne Collins fan. This middle grade reader is well-paced, filled with good humor and commentary, and has a very likable cast of characters."
4,Amazing 2nd book,"After reading the first book I couldn't wait to start the second an it was just as good if not better than the first. I didn't want to put it down. A fast, but good read."
5,Great,"Great plot and impossible to put down, also there are other books but a bit too bloody but still one of the best books I have ever read"
5,Great sequel,"A great follow-up to The Underland Chronicles #1. I love Gregor's relationship with Boots. I never had an older brother, but he's just how I imagine a good older brother to be. It was also fun to see him developing more into the Warrior of the prophecies."
5,Best book,I gave it a five star rating because it's an amazing book!It was filled with adventure and I really felt the tears and happiness. I love this series!
5,Great Adventure for young teens,"I enjoyed this book, especially since I was reviewing it for my kids to read. Suzanne Collins does a great job developing characters you want to continue reading about. I think she does a good balance of allowing bad things to happen but still have a happy-ish ending. I think this is the right way to go when you are writing for adolescents. I would recommend this book."
4,Very entertaining,I Loved the suspense and new characters. It was Very entertaining and i cannot wait to read the next one.
3,Mediocre at best,"I have to say that this book was good, but not too good. What makes the book interesting is taking human warriors from earth and bringing them to nayve to help fight a war. Also, there are many different races to help add diversity to the book. There's even a talking dog named ulfgang! The things that I didn't like though was when belynda got raped by king christopher. Also, some of the things in the book come to quick and aren't explained as good as they should be. Also be aware of the sexuality, as it is common in the second book as well. Still, it was a good read."
1,Never rises above a cliche,"In addition to other criticisms about the book, I'd like to add that the world that Niles has created really doesn't make any sense. He has slapped to together a bunch of fantasy staples such as elves, druids, dwarves, etc. without much regard to how they arrived or fit in his world. Things are exist because he wrote it -- no internal logic is necessary.Terry Pratchett's Discworld books make much more sense -- and we're talking about a parody where that world rests on the back of a giant space-faring turtle!"
2,The shallow circle,"Niles' concept of the different realms layered around each other is an interesting one. And his portrayal of the different beings (elves, drwarves, airies, etc.) is also good. However his character development is far to shallow and his imagry poor. He did not exploit the full potential of this story; it could have been much more. In addition, Niles seems to have a fixation on gore and sex which are used inappropriately (in my opinion) in the book. His use of sex in the beginning of the book added no value. His dwelling of the gore of the arcane Delver is as close to deep character development that he gets (which isn't very deep)."
3,Silly. I was looking for a real solution.,"We don't need to know how many dust mites are in our food or how many infectious bacteria entering the air every time someone sneezes. What I had hoped to get in this book is a story of how to help these people. My husband has a daughter who is a severe hypochondriac, and we worry about her. She is ill every week, and has been on more medication at age 17 that I am surprised she is alive. Hypochondria is a serious illness, and I hope I can find some book somewhere that can help me with this."
3,Writen by a Friend,I heard a close friend has been writing under a nom de plume (sp) and was curious.Called him and congratulated him
1,If only it worked,"I received it as a Christmas gift and I have worn it 3 times while working out in the past 1.5 weeks. The pedometer screen stopped working after the first workout, and I couldn't even figure out how to get it to work. The FM reception is horrible both inside and outside. Additionally, each time I moved, the connection from the headset to the device was lost. You have to hold the headset connection steady which isn't convenient when you are working out. I definitely do not recommend. I am currently trying to find another sports walkman, any suggestions?"
1,nice idea but fatally flawed design,"Like the previous reviewer, I found the connection to the headset very finicky. I exchanged my first one for another and had the same problem. I believe the problem is that the batteries don't lock into place such that the power connection goes out frequently, losing stored data and failing to record steps properly. The manufacuter was completely uninterested in hearing this feedback or helping me figure out how to get the batteries to stay in place so I returned the product for a credit."
4,Pretty amazing,"I received this as a gift a couple of weeks ago and am pretty pleased all in all...<br /><br />Pro: Step counter is pretty darn amazingly accurate - I did multiple takes on the ""100 Step"" test recommended in the setup and it came close every time. (I'm still trying to figure out how it does this since I was wearing it as recommended at my waist) FM reception is good; earphones have crisp tone. Individual tasks in the instructions are clear and simple (but wish there was more of an overall walk-thru - I missed the step on entering the length of my step the first go-around!)<br /><br />Con: No display of the FM channel you're listening to so while the scan feature works well, not easy to find a specific station. (Personally, I wish it did AM as well as FM)"
3,Okay...................................,"Well,I actually liked this game,its pretty fun,you can make all kinds different landmarks,and you make and control your your own city!But,the main problem with it was i couldn't figure out how to save a game-It didn't say anywhere,and it was so furasturating!!!!!!!!!but other than that it was pretty fun,I would recomend any Sim game-especially Sim Tower......Also You might like Zoo tycoon,and the Roller Coaster Tycoon games....."
1,Manotinous,Fun at first but gets old VERY fast and isnt worth your time get the unlimited version for like 3 or 4 bucks more and enjoy.
1,Sim City 2000 is much better,This game may have prettier graphics than Sim City 2000 and Sim City Classic however the designers turned it more into a toy looking game. Being able to see the actual cars is hardly exciting after 5 minutes and it hogs system performance. I was really hoping for an intellegent game not just pretty graphics. Also this game is not a challenge. It is so easy to make money espeacially on full speed. With an endless amount of money it seems the game is won and is really boring.
2,Memory hog,"I thought this game was great fun until my city grew to about 30,000 residents. The game became so slow that I dreaded ever having to go lay any water pipes because of the load time between views. (I was running on a 450/128MB/40X). So I became very frustrated very quickly with all of the load time and gave up. If you don't mind twiddling your thumbs, this is a great game."
5,WONDERFUL!,WOW! SimCity 3000 is one of the best games I have ever had the honor of playing. The graphics are sharp and original and the music is entertaning (especially compared to SimCity 2000). I've throughly enjoyed playing this game and would recomend it to anyone.
3,Not much better than the last...,"Pretty much just an upgrade over SC2K... definately improved, but no great new innovations here. Recommended, but not enthusiastically."
2,SimCity 4 will be better.,If you haven't got SimCity 3000 yet than don't buy it. You will enjoy SimCity 4 which will be hitting shelfs in November.The graphics are bad because they still used the SimVCity 2000 engine for it (although SimCity 2000 was much better). Trust me you will like SC4 better. You can import your sims and the game has a whole new 3D engine.This game needs a bit of improvement. The fires are a bit yuck. And the buildings need some help. If you can't wait until November than just waiste your money and get it.
4,Sim skip . . .,"SimCity 3000 forces the player to become attached to his or her city. You will find yourself during dinner or what have you, wondering if the free way system you installed will take to the simcitizens.However, with all the time this game consumes, once your city hits a certain point, you must move onto another city, otherwise you get bored, and shelf the game. I suggest you skip this edition, drop the extra money, and go straight for the Unlimited Edition. It will be much more rewarding, and worth the cash."
5,Best strategy game of the decade,"Sim City 3000 is the best strategy game I have ever played. The ability to watch your city grow, have detailed charts and graphs and is an amazing feature. I recommend the Prima SC3000 Strategy Guide to master this game, as it is hard to learn how to play."
4,Ennnh,"Its alot like Sim City 2000, but it gives it a few new twists and better graphics. You have more control over the types of neighborhoods you make. Its fun."
4,Fascinating!,"When SC3K first came out, it seemed as if many people were disappointed because it did not look much different from SC2K. It certainly is not the technological leap that we saw from the original to SC2K. However this is NOT merely an expansion of SC2K. I'm not sure exactly how, but the game feels, at once, familiar yet different.This game is truly fun to play; much more so than SC2K. Simply the amount of information given to you and the things that you can do, increase the enjoyment of this game. The changes from SC2K are subtle, but have huge consequences the further you build a city. SC3K may not look that different from its predecessor but Maxis has actually gotten much closer to what the actual experience of city planning and building must be like. I'm curious what Maxis will throw at us in the next installment."
3,Good Game,"I thoght this game was really fun. The only problem I found with it, is that you have to be patient at the start and make money before you can really build your town. On one of the reviews it said, ""Don't get this game if your under sixteen."" I'm 13 and I made tons of money on the game. As long as you start out slow you won't get in debt."
3,It's always hard to be good in a sequel,I had the SimCity Classics and played hours with it. Then the SimCity 2000 came out. I had to change my computer as it was not fast enough. I played days with it. Then the SimCity 3000 came out. Unfortunately I am not changing my computer and I am playing with it coz I already deleted my SimCity 2000. The 3000 took up lots of space and offered better graphics and some additions like the ability to supply electricity and water to neighbours. But essentially it is still 2000 with some modifications. I still like my SimCity 2000. Wish I hadn't deleted that.
3,Not worth the hype!,"For all of you out there who liked the gameplay of Sim City 2000, the gameplay in the sequel isn't that much better. If you didn't get SC 2000, or are looking for better graphics, then this may be the game for you!"
4,Big Improvement,"I own not only SimCity 3000, but SimCity Classic, and SimCity 2000 (Along with a host of other Sim games). SimCity 3000 is an amazing step in technology over 2000. They best part is the vast variety of building capable of being downloaded from the Maxis site. A Great Game!!"
4,Worthwhile upgrade to SimCity 2000,"One of the cool features to SimCity 3000 is that you can import all your previously built cities from SC2000. My 13 year-old daughter spends a lot of time building (and then tearing down) cities. It's a nice alternative to blowing up monsters.The only problem with running it was that I had to turn off 3D acceleration on my system (RIVA TNT) to cure a ""flickering"" problem. If anyone knows of another workaround, let me know!"
4,"This game is Awesome, but gets boring after awile","My best city, dubbed Metro i created W/O cheats, and right now there is simply nothing to do. i filled the whole map, and everything is Perfect. It is Definetly the best SIM game, and even so, my city took at least 60 hours to build, and you can also biuild new ones, so you should by the game."
2,Hard At First But Keeps on Getting Easier!,"Me and my brother bought this game when it first came out. At first we played it all the time but it starts to get to become boring.At first , the game is very difficult and fun. You have trouble knowing what laws to pass and how to build up your city. you have to pay off your debts and still have extra money. you have to figure out what deals you should be making with neighboring towns. you have to expand the population of your city. you have to figure out a good tax rate. you have to figure out how many schools, hospitals, police stations, and fire stations to build and where you should put them. you have to make a yearly budget for how many parks, libraries, museums, jails, colleges, zoos, ballparks, bus stops, and train stations. you have to cope with natural disasters, UFO attacks, and riots. it's fun at first, but it's always the same so it gets boring."
2,2000 or 3000,"The differences between 2000 and 3000 are small. Well 1) thier is more buildings. and 2) Their is more oppertunites to make money. Other than that the game isn't harder, or any more fun. Save yourself the Money if you want to get a Sim City, Get 2000."
2,I did not like it,I love Sim. games very much but I did not like this Sim. game. After I would have my little city all set up I would need to watch it like a hawk leaving me with almost no time to expand and improve on my little city. I have been told to give this game another try but I just can not find a reason to go back and try this game again.
1,Sim City 2010 would be a more appropriate title!,"This game is an unbelievable disappointment. Sim City 3000 is basically Sim City 2000 with some graphics improvements and a few new features, which only slightly change the game play. If you haven't played Sim City 2K much, Sim City 3K might be worth purchasing. Otherwise, this game is a waste of money."
2,Another example of a fine series with unrealized promise.,"SimCity 3000 had every opportunity in the world to be a correction on the mostly misguided SimCity 2000. Unfortunately, it succeeds mostly at making one want to play that earlier game again. Better designed overall, the simulation model has grown so complex that the game is nearly unplayable. It is extremely difficult to effectively get your city underway, and the available help functions in the game are not sufficient to explain the complex theories of economics that the game requires you to understand in order to effectively govern your city. When SimCity was still about being the mayor of a city instead of showing you just what feats of computing are possible, it was a much stronger game. Until Maxis gets that idea back, SimCity 3000--for all of its good points--is just simply not worth playing."
4,sim city 3k (3000),I think that this game is a very good game. I like the way that you are in control of the city. this game can also be an educational game. you have to deal with money and keeping your people happy. If your people are not happy they will leave the city and it will become a gost town with. The thing that I like as oppose to SimCity 2000 is that you can put world monuments in your city. I think that this game is good for kids and it is a good educational experiance.
3,A seriously difficult game.,"Sim City 3000 is good game, yet it is the hardest game I have ever played. The main problem is getting money. I can never get any profit at the end of each year. Sure, I can use the $100,000 cheat code, but it only works once. Another problem is getting the people to work. Even if you put residential areas (where they live) next to industrial areas (where they work), they still might complain that it is too far to go. Some good things about Sim City 3000 is that you can build famous landscapes. Also, the graphics are great! If you are considering buying this city-building game, I would suggest The Sims or Roller Coaster Tycoon instead."
5,One of the few games I always keep on my machine!,"I have been a fan of Sim City since the original version, and have been upgrading and installing on new PC's ever since the first version. This is one of the few games to ever really capture my imagination. It also has proven to be a lot of fun for my kids, as well -- and it is probably teaching them a few things about cities, geography and government at the same time. This version is the best -- some very nice, thoughtful upgrades; much better graphics. It's worth buying if you've never owned it; worth upgrading if you have an earlier version."
4,2000 vs 3000,"I bought Sim City 3000 a while ago and I play the game a lot. I also have Sim City, and Sim City 2000. The game is a lot of fun, detail is a lot better than 2000, and there is more to do with this game. BUT even though it is a great game, it is almost the same as 2000. My sugestion is that if you have Sim City 2000 and want beter game play I wouldn't buy this, but if you don't have Sim City 2000 and are trying to decide whether to buy 2000 or 3000, I would definately buy 3000, even if it cost a little more."
2,Choose There Fate,"I dont see any difference when you watch this version, i even picked each one and rewound but they were the same. Does anyone know how it really works? The movie was ok though."
4,final destination 3,"Recently, I brought this two blue ray disc. however, it did not have any subtitle to select for viewing on this two titles. Is it product defect or there is a two version of this title. Anyway, overrall movie was good and entertaining."
3,Not Bad,"FD3 is not too bad; I don't think it was as good as FD2, which in my opinion was the best of the three, but it wasn't bad. I loved the interactive mode on the movie. That was great.However, like most ""Dead Teenager movies,"" the more of these they make, the more monotonous they become. There was no real shock value in the movie, other than the ""pimp"" dude getting a drill put through the back of his head.Like I said, it's not a bad movie. If you see it, great; if you don't, it's not that big of a deal."
4,Better than the 2nd worse than the 1st,"After i watched Final Destination 2 i was thinking that they wouldnt make another movie.When i heard they were i was a little suprised.I watched it in the cinima and turned out really good.The death scenes were more cringy and chilling,like the tanning bit.I was covering my eyes on that scene."
3,FULL SCREEN FREEZE'S,"ALL I CAN SAY IS IT WAS A VERY GOOD MOVIE IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT JUST READ A BOOK INSTEAD. BUT THERE'S GOOD & BAD THE GOOD IS THAT I WOULD SAY A 5 STAR AND THE BEST FROM THE DEATH SEEN BUT, THE WORST WOULD BE 1 STAR BECAUSE I HAD TO GO TO THE VIDEO STORE 2 TIMES FROM A FULL SCREEN THAT FREEZE EVERY TIME FROM THE ""CHOOSE THEIR FATE"" HATE TO TELL YA IT SUCKED... ALSO TRIED THE THEATER VERSION AND STILL FREEZE THE SAME. NEW LINE HOME VIDEO SHOULD NEED SOME REPLACEMENTS BUT DON'T KNOW HOW TO CONTACT THEM OR EMAIL EITHER -- HELP!!!"
2,sucked,"R U guys kidding me. FD3 is the worst of the trilogy. None of the main male/female characters were good looking. And even though the female lead knew how to act, she couldn't carry the movie. None of the actors had any star quality unlike FD1 & FD2. Oh!!! The rollercoaster sequence was so lame and fake. This should've been released as a direct to DVD. The actors in FD1 & FD2 really knew how to act and carry the movie. Not this one. And i'm so tired of seeing blond G String bimbos in horror movies. Boob shots. Big deal. If i wanted to see that i would go rent an XXX-rated porno flick. Bimbo tanning girls would say ""like oh my god this movie i was in like totally sucks."" This movie is like the OC or One Tree Hill meets The Grim Reaper. Stupid !"
4,"Not As Good as the first 2, but Death Scenes are still Ruthless!","Ofcourse this film isn't as good as 1 or 2, but it still delivers the crazy, inventive, booby trap-like death scenes that audiences have come to know from the Final Destination Films. That's why you go, to see how creative and terrible death will strike this time around.In this film we ofcourse know the premonition will be of a rollercoaster accident, but still seeing it happen was an adrenaline rush of anxiety, they sure know how to build up the suspense! After the premonition, and the few lucky ones to get off the ride are saved, they are mysteriously picked off one by one in creative and extremely ruthless style deaths. But this time they have photo clues that help them survive, or at least postpone the inevitable.A ""Scary Movie"" rule for a 3rd Film Installment is a higher body count and this one does deliver. I can vouch by the gasps and screams, and outright ""ahhh man""'s from the audience, that you won't be disappointed!"
2,Right about average,"There isn't anything terribly clever - certainly nothing new - in Final Destination 3. It's a rehash of hash, so to speak, and should be approached accordingly.We all know the plot at this point, so repeating it here seems unnecessary. What you're probably looking for is whether you should watch it. Here's the guide: if you loved the first two Final Destination films and thought they were boffo clever, then you'll like this. If you're curious to see what the fuss is about (they did make three films, after all), don't bother with this one. See the first (also directed by James Wong). It was better."
3,Final Destination 3,Final Destination 3 was better than the second one. It was predictable at times but it held my interest. The tanning scene was probably the best death out of all of them. I`m now scared to go into one of those tanning beds. The camera work on the rollercoaster scene was really well done and it was really cool to watch on the big screen. It was a good movie.
2,Same old story,"The third film in the Final Destination series has nothing new to offer, and it is by far the weakest one in the series. If you have seen the first two movies, then you can leave this one out of your DVD collection. It's the same old story, it just has a brand new wrapping.The first Final Destination movie gave the viewer some creepy moments, while number 2 and 3 must rely on huge amounts of blood and gore. Sure, there are some rather spectacular ""accidents and killings"" in part 2 and 3, but without a good, fresh and exciting story, the film falls flat."
2,Time to end it,It wasn't a bad movie. It just wasn't near as good as the previous two. I didn't really care about any of the characters. The death scenes were actually kind of funny. But they also weren't all that imaginative either. I love the first two films because the ways people died was just so cool. In this one they find new ways to smash people's heads.
2,Laughable...,"Something tells me that this is the last movie titled Final Destination I will ever watch. What told me this was an incredibly bad, unrealistic, teenage gorefest of a movie called Final Destination 3. Talk about beating a dead horse. This movie offers absolutely nothing new to the series. We have human beings made of silly putty that smash if something over 10 pounds falls on them. We also have death acting as creative as ever. He's even nice enough to give clues to our fellow teens in photographs so they can try and avoid it. What a guy. Hopefully death can pull one more favor and kill off this series."
5,Choose your Fate walkthrough - no spoilers!,"Here are the 8 options I found and the choice that will change things.Note that option 6 will only exist if you have taken option 3.1. Coin flip at rollercoaster: Tails.2. At tanning salon: 73 or 76 degrees? 76.3. At drive thru: should Wendy honk? Yes.4. In Wendy's bedroom: Should Wendy look again? Yes.5. At BuildIt: Warning shot or Kill shot? Warning shot.6. At police station: Question pops up; answer Yes.7. When sign falls on Ian: Jump right or Jump left? Jump right.8. On subway train: Map or No map? Map.Some changes are more subtle than others. One of them is a lot of fun. I won't ruin it for you - just try them all and see.If anyone else has found other stuff please comment on my review, I don't want to miss anything!"
4,Still exciting,"I enjoyed this cinema a lot; whole different plot, cast of characters; keeps you on the edge of your seat even when you know the premise of the cinema."
4,Another in the line of destinations via accidents.,"This is the third in the line of the final destination enterprise. I loved the first two and still find it outstanding how the writers or director can come up with so many ways to kill people with such violent means. I love the suprise way they come up with killing the people one-by-one in such a graphic manner. As if you didn't get enough, this movie adds in interactivity by letting you choose from a coin toss how they die which could change the movie in how it plays out. To me another great action pic."
4,"See FD 1 & 2 to enjoy #3 even more!!....tie-ins sweet like ""Lost""","Loved tie-in to prior FD1 &2 and historical details. History connections made me more interested in historical details....maybe their is some connection or pattern to ""180"". Must have same writers for all 3 movies or someone that loves the first two installments. It made me think of the subtle details hidden in the TV show ""Lost"". Hope DVD release includes details of how they did the special effects which were gory and elaborate. Movie was very entertaining."
4,What's with the photos?,"Ok, I realize that it's silly to nitpick a movie like this one, but has anyone but me noticed that the photos, which were taken BEFORE the ride began contained clues to the student's ALTERNATE deaths?The original intention was for the students to die on the roller coaster,not in the elaborate, drawn out methods in which they eventually did die.Shouldn't the photos contain no clues at all, or, at the very least make some reference to the roller coaster?Anyway, it's a better movie than I expected, and makes a good addition to the Final Destination series."
1,"""Don't take control of the ride""","""Only one way to watch the film!""As per a previous review(which I wish I'd seen before I purchased),this Blu-Ray disc has just the Theatrical version of the filmand not the ""Choose their fate"" option,as advertised on the back cover.Having seen the Dvd ""choose their fate"" version,I specifically boughtthis blu-ray for just that feature.Not so much ""Take control of the ride"" as ""Taken for a ride!""Not happy !!!!!"
3,Short and Predictable,"I enjoyed the first two Final Destination movies because the concept was unique and the movies were suspenseful. Final Destination Three is only an hour and a half long, the movie ends abruptly and the death scenes are completely predictable. In addition, the dialogue doesn't make any sense - people will snap and curse at each other for no reason. The first two stayed away from nudity, this movie also had some nudity.If you have never seen any Final Destination movie, I would recommend any of the first two over this one. If you have seen the other movies, you might want to watch this if you are curious."
2,"Dull, boring, and nothing new","I eagerly anticipated the release of this movie since I was such a fan of the first two. The ""escape death"" scenes of the airplane and highway accident were amazingly crafted and well thought out and executed well. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the roller coaster incident. While it had promise, the execution was quite dark, a bit of a stretch, and not nearly as aww inspiring as the previous two movies. In fact, it was so disappointing, I almost wanted a refund, but chose to watch the remainder of the film to see if it could redeem itself. I was mostly wrong. While some of the death scenes were entertaining, there was too much predictability and the acting (with the exception of Merriman) was horrible.This is truly mindless murder fare that should be playing in the background of a party and not the central focus of your movie watching evening."
4,Final Destination 3,"I like the Final Destination movies. Number 3 was probably my favorite, then number 5 (because the ending was very clever). I give Final Destination 3 four stars."
2,waste of time and money,"no subtitle , u cant choose any language plus the movie lack of new actionsfirst 1 was very cool second is watchable .third one was full of crap .don't buy it save your money , buy an ice cream instaed .Very sorry"
1,Final Chapter. Thank God!,"Don't get me wrong. Its not that I didn't like this movie, instead I hated this movie. I enjoyed the first one as it gave a new and original twist to the slasher franchise (Death being the killer). The second Final Destination was just OK, with lots of cool death scenes, terrible acting and even worse plot. But the third (and hopefully the final Final Destination) was just pure pig s**t. The acting was even worse and the plot was just a copy of Final Destination 2. To me, this movie was FD2 all over again. With a girl who predicts who dies and how, while the rest of the thick as s**t teenagers try and survive.Overall, an idiotic movie that just does not entertain. Not even the death scenes are cool in this one. However, if you really liked the 1st and 2nd FD you should try this one out."
2,"The ""perfect"" prescription","""Doctor, doctor, you have to help me!""""What's wrong?""""Well, my pulse is racing and I'm all excited.""""Why?

4,Pearl,"In this mosaic of stories, Lillian comes of age and matures beyond her years, almost against her will. With an alcoholic father and a fragile, flighty mother, Lillian, with her siblings, struggles with her troubled family, and yet they all fiercely love each other, flaws and all. While this isn't a conscious feeling, it does crackle beneath the surface and colors the actions of everyone. Lillian navigates a lonely path encompassing sexuality and a yearning to be free. With a crisp voice and a vivid portrait of Acorn Lake, Minnesota, ""A Brief History of the Flood"" waxes almost nostalgic as it nudges the reader through these various tales that deliver a surprising portrait of a family unbalanced."
4,"Simple, Honest Story Telling","The perfect choice for a book club looking for an undiscovered gem, this is a delightful read that is lean enough to consume in one sitting, or savor over a few days. It's a coming of age story told through the eyes of young Lillian Anderson, a girl growing up in the sixties in a small town in Minnesota. Chapters are short bursts of her life: her Mother's dramatic mood swings, her Father's alcoholism, first sexual experience, first job, first crush.All told with an honest intimacy that at times feels less like a novel, and more like someone's diary entries. Her heroine at times reminded me of Astrid in ""White Oleander"", and if that was a book you liked you'd probably enjoy this one as well. A well written, comfortable first novel."
5,Wonderful Writing,"A Brief History of the Flood is a wonderful collection of linked short stories, chronicling the lives of the Anderson family from 1959 to 1970 in Minnesota. Lillian, one of the children narrates. We meet her when she is 8 and watch as she grows into a sullen adolescent. The writing in these stories is wonderful and evocative. There is one story in particular that stands out in my mind in which Lillian attends an anniversary party for her parents. Her observations of the adults milling around her is perfectly dead on, well put. This is an excellent collection, with more cohesiveness than other short story collections because we follow the same characters over the course of eleven years. Enjoy."
5,Cherry VAnilla Tea,The product arrived on time and is first quality. My wife is the tea drinker and she loves it.Cherry Vanilla tea is not easy to find. I would recommend this product to anyone.
5,Ed is #1,"Ed Thigpen has recorded a terrific CD with Scantet #1. He utilizes his long standing, extensive Europian connections to form a Quintet which moves right along. This studio band is obviously well rehearsed and represents structured europian bebop."
5,Its enjoyable and in some ways funny.,I liked it because it gave brief summaries on the characters background and there previous actions on the television show.
4,Great follow up to Lachlain and Emma's story (book 1),"Books 1 and 3 are great and this one would have been equally excellent except for the horribly irritating female lead, Kaderin. Sebastian (lead male), though, saves the book and makes it a worthy follow up to book 1. Book 4 is when things start slowing down - not yet totally drop dead boring but not something I would buy if given a do-over. Stop with book 4; 5ooks 5-7 are a waste of time and money."
4,Could have been better,"This book was enjoyable but not as much as the first one. I wasn't crazy about the character of Kaderin, I thought she was rude and I got tired of her being so mean to this sweet man. If I was him I would have told her to take a hike, but of course he didn't. The character development in this book wasn't the greatest. I was more interested in the secondary characters like Regin and Bowen. I'm looking forward to Bowen's book.FYI: Kresley Cole writes the BEST sex scenes!"
2,Whiney vampires?????,"Liked the heroine, strong willed and ready for action at all times. On the other hand, the vampire hero is quite whiney, lost and weak. I started the series with this book and then found out there is a previous installment. Recommendation - start with the first book for sure. All in all, the series is great, but don't judge only based on this book."
4,love the series but...,"While I love all the series, the heroine in this drama is a bit*h and a bit if a cock tease. I found that I could not get with her ""mixed signals"" style, which is why I gave it a 4 stars. Love the story and the action. Be warned Kaderin is not cold-hearted; she is heartless."
4,Wow..,I love the fact that these books take on all kinds of supernatural creatures and put a twist to them. It was very enjoyable from begining to end. :O)
5,My favorite in the series,"I read this when it first came out in 2007. I am now reading ""Pleasure of a Dark Prince"". I have read most of the books in the series, and this is my favorite one."
5,Loved this! Can't put down!,"Yet another hot, and passionate book in the Immortals After Dark series. Kresley Cole keeps you engulfed in imagination, and the hottest feelings of lust rush through you as you feel yourself becoming the women in her books over and over! May the ""Gods"" help you as you fall helplessly in love, and the flames of passionate fiery sexual desires hold you in the lustful arms of her hot hero of each book in bed every single night! ~*Wicked Grins*~"
4,Still good!,I liked this book but not as much as the one before it in the series. I loved it while I was reading it but the extra umph wasn't there for me. I'm continuing with the series because I've fallen in love with the characters and the world Kresley Cole has created but I'm hoping the next book really knocks my socks off.
4,Book was ok - ....,"I found the book to be OK, not outstanding. Too much of the contest for me. My main reason for reading paranormal romances is the couple involved. I wanted more between them. I found myself skipping over some of the contest travels to get to the romance interaction.I've started Book 3 and it seems I'm liking that one better already. It may just be because I'm deeper into the world Ms.Cole has created.I don't think you'll be disappointed. I enjoy Christine Feehan (my favorite) and the first books by J.R. Ward's Dark Series. I don't think this one was quite as good on the romance/love/sex parts of the book."
4,No rest for the wicked,"I did like this book. Alot of the book was about a competion called the Hie, it is like the olympics for immortals."
3,"Not great, not terrible","Overall, I thought this was a fun, easy paranormal read, perfect for a day off or beach reading. Kaderin was a fun female protagonist, and as always, Cole's world was very well-developed. Not sure it really holds up to some of the better installments in this series, though."
3,Sigh...,"Pardon my grammar but Im so uttery depressed from this book so much, Im even typing in my kindlebook.Bowe.... did no one not notice him? I felt so horrible for them to be selfish. I suppose that it's life and realism. I did not want him to find his old mate but gah!!! I weep for him..."
3,"Average, not Great","I had high hopes and expectations for this book, but I was a little disappointed. It seemed like the hero and heroine spent most of the book just running around from place to place.Not that that's necessarily a bad thing, but it seemed like their relationship is squeezed in between all of their travels. The end result, for me at least was that their whole relationship came off as seeming rushed and unrealistic, as well as a little awkward.It was kind of disappointing, because Kresley Cole is an author who generally does the whole ""fated mate"" thing really well, and if she had fleshed out the characters and especially their interactions a little more, it could have turned out much better.Still, this book might be worth buying if only to see the characters from the previous books, and it does lay out some subplots for future books. All of the other books in her Immortals After Dark series are really good, so this book might at least be worth reading as a ""link"" book."
3,A good story with lousy characters,Sometimes you have to put up with the good and the bad. But really the heroine is awful. She is borderline abusive and takes every chance to hurt the hero emotionally. The hero is a know it all he-man who does not take in to account that the heroine is double is age and might have learned something he doesn't know. He complete disregards her wishes and she completely disregards him time after time after time. There is some good action and dialogue but not enough to make me lose my irritation with both of them.
1,Sooooooooooo Awful!!,"I see that many people who have read this book gave rave reviews but, I could not find one redeeming quality. Sebastian and Kaderin are brought together romantically before the story had a chance to build any anticipation and then the story became so predictable I completely lost interest. It read like so many cheap novels. What a major disappointment!"
2,I Really Wanted to Like This Book,"Having read a J. Edward Ames short story that hit me like a baseball bat right between the eyes (""A Stain Upon Her Honor"") I took umbrage at SAXFAM's dismissive review of Spellcaster, mentally rolling up my sleeves in preparation for the drubbing I was going to give this obviously thick-headed reviewer with the funny name. But having received a used copy of the out-of-print Spellcaster through Amazon.com I now have to admit that SAXFAM's assessment is dead-on . . . dammit. And me with outstanding orders for the three other out-of-print Ames novels listed . . ."
3,The Old Walking Statue Trick,"The story starts out with a framing story set after the reign of King Conan when one of his sons is in danger. It moves to the time after the death of Belit when Conan wanders the Black Kingdoms and encounters the Bamula tribe. The initial jungle adventure is done well and I was reminded of Burroughs early tales of Tarzan. However, after this promising start, Green moves the story and all of its characters to Pictland where a Pictish wizard is working on the task of animating a statue of an ancient warrior. REH and his pastichers have done the animated statue several times and this adads nothing new to the mix. In a ridiculous plot thread which explains the transportation of Conan and the Bamulas, the statue can be animated by the blood of a loved one ... or 20 total strangers.Green is and excelent fantasy author but this Conan adventure falls short."
3,Super Reader,"After the death of Belit, Conan is trying to get somewhere else, but ends up leading some Bamulas through Pictish wilderness to try and get to safety.A sorcerer, a sorcerer's comely daughter, and an otherworldly portal get in the way. So does a great big life sucking statue.Sounds better than it actually is."
3,Just another compillation,"If you already have Jet Propeller Photograph, don't bother - this one is one more early years compillation"
3,Not His Best But Significant,"Matt's right, a nice re-issue for collectors. ""Louis Armstrong's 'Hello Dolly!'"" may have been one of the last acoustic jazz hit records in the sixties. Unlike Matt's copy, however, my recently purchased MCA CD has all the tracks extant, but MCA hasn't gotten the credits completely correct: Russell Moore IS playing trombone on one of the sides that the liner notes say he's not. In fact, Louis calls for him to solo as part of his lyric. No mention either of the strings that subtley underplay on ""Jeepers Creepers.""Louie doesn't seem at peak form here -- as he does on his recordings paying tribute to Fats Waller and J.C. Handy, for example -- and the relationship of these tune selections to each other seems random, but it is nonetheless delightful to hear the master player/singer in his waning years, when many of us were enjoying the Beatles and loosing our jazz footings a bit. An historically significant recording."
4,Masterful if not a masterpiece,"If you take this album on its own terms, as a solid day's work by one of the greatest pop singers of all time who was still making hits in his Sixties, in the Sixties, it's pretty darned good. He defines the title cut - an unswinging Broadway number few would have nominated for The Great American Songbook - & makes it a standard that paid Jerry Herman's utility bills thereafter. On the others, mostly with minimal small band accompaniment, in a matter of a minute or two Louis pulls everything worth getting out of them & tosses off a trumpet solo for icing on the cake. It's a masterful demonstration if not a masterpiece. Of course, it's no substitute for Armstrong's peerless jazz & pop recordings from the Twenties & Thirties. But, oh my, he knocked The Beatles out of #1 & showed 'em who was The Boss, laughed about it, & to my knowledge never knocked the Fab Four in doing it. Even Sinatra was awed."
5,Great Product,"Use very little, foams a lot. Smells little like poison and sun screen - but man it foams and cleans the car. Worth the money, great product!"
4,Thrilled to find this!,"It is very difficult to find products that support my life on blood thinners. I was thrilled to find these Coumadin tags.... they are now on the back of my watch, as well as my drivers license. My only problem is that the sticky backs come off easily, and the tube of adhesive can be hard to use. I have lost a couple of these tags because of that, so was glad that some extras were included."
5,Farmall Tractors,"We purchased this beautiful book as a gift for my dad for his birthday. He has two Farmall tractors which he restored himself and enjoys entering them into shows and competitions. He is very knowledgeable of this brand, but he was very impressed with the information and the gorgeous photographs. He also said there was a good amount of history about Farmall that he was not aware of and it was very enjoyable to read about.My husband and I flipped through the book when it was received and I have to say it was far more than we expected for the price. The photography is exquisite.If you are a tractor enthusiast, you will love this book!Thanks to Amazon for making such a great product available at such a reasonable price."
5,Bought it for my dad.,I bought this book for my dad. He has lots of old Farmall tractors that are waiting to be restored. He will really enjoy this book.
2,Wouldnt Buy It Again,"Didn't really like the flavor. It's kind of expensive, and you really don't get that much product for the price. I think you are paying for the name more than the product itself. Not terrible, but not great."
4,Great rub!,This is great rub when you don't have time to make your own. It will give good results each time.
5,Spicing things up!,"I use this delicious rub on LOTS of meats. Beyond the obvious uses on ribs and other smoked meats, it also adds zippy flavor to chicken and fish, which I shred to make tacos and tostadas."
1,Taste is indescribable,"We've tried this once on everything - beef, chicken and fish. We haven't cared for it on any of it and the rest will end up in the trash. We've been on a search for the best rubs and this is not it. I'm not sure what it really tastes like, but we much prefer Kansas City Steak seasoning on steaks andChar Crust Roasted Garlic Peppercorn Rub - 4 ozon poultry and fish. Won't be reordering."
1,if ever a good song was played out it's this one.,"I didn't like this song at first but then I started likeing it, now I hate it. It's so over exposed and over played. It was a good song with a good beat but now it just is hard to listen to."
3,dre is the bestr thing that happened to 50,man one of the hardest beats dre's done since he left deathrow.
4,Tea for 1 please,"This is a darling set. It is very pretty and all the classic durability you would expect from FiestaWare. But as the previous review said, Its misnamed at ""Tea for Two"". The teapot holds two cups but only comes with one cup. If you want to serve tea to a friend, you will have mismatched cups.That being said, I used my teapot this morning to heat up 2 cups of water. One cup went into the teacup for hot cider for me, the other I poured into a Nascar mug for my 9 year old to have hot chocolate.In short, this is a great set as long as you understand you are only getting 1 teacup."
3,"Interesting, but not well done","It's a very interesting concept, but poorly written and edited. There are tons of grammatical and spelling errors as well as phrases that just don't make sense."
4,A Helpful and Fun Title for Lovers of Pirate Lore,"""The Pirate Dictionary"" is an entertaining and well-written book offering, in alphabetical order, definitions of the words and phrases we have come to know and associate with pirates. The entries launch with ""Aback"" and drop anchor with ""Zee-Rover"" (which is Dutch for ""pirates,"" and in English is ""sea-rovers""). Many of the entries are words everyone knows, but author Terry Breverton (""Black Bart Roberts: The Greatest Pirate of Them All"") has managed to include enough information about them to make each entry worth reading. More illustrations would have been useful and helpful. A handy, valuable historical reference written for the general public. Recommended."
3,Too Many Typos,"This was an intriguing book. However, I was greatly disappointed by all of the typo errors. It seems as if it was rushed to printing and the editors did a really poor job."
3,International Talk Like A Pirate Day,"As an early adapter of International Talk Like a Pirate Day, I enthusiastically purchased The Pirate Dictionary hoping to extend my vocab beyond, ""ARGH"" .... ""Matey"" ... ""Grog"" and, ""AVAST!""And while The Pirate Dictionary has plenty of useful pirate terminology, interesting history and detailed anecdotes, I have to agree with other reviewers and say that it may have been editted by actual pirates.But even with typos, I found the book a very enjoyable read (especially for skimming while in the bathroom in preparation for September 19th, International Talk Like a Pirate Day)."
3,Fun little book - Learn to speak like a Pirate!,I never knew that so many of our common English-language phrases and ideas originated with sailors and pirates. A fun and engaging little book.
2,Hardy har har,Book is what it is-A dictionary-not a funny take off on Pirates-but a real dictionary mainly loaded with nautical terms--avoid if you seek humor
3,"not for me, but . . .","As an English major, this book makes me wince from one entry to the next. But, I did not buy it for myself. I bought it for my dyslexic boyfriend who dreams of quitting his job and becoming a pirate. Grammar and spelling aside, it's a good read. Since I cannot put grammar and spelling aside, I detest it. Since my boyfriend probably won't notice the typos, it's probably a sure thing."
3,Very Informative,"Though the book does a good job of laying out the chain of command, army structure,rank structure,and a history of how the army came to be what it was in that period, thats not really what I was personally looking for in a book about uniforms. It does have general descriptions of shoulder straps and their meanings as well as some general issue and commonly seen decorations, but these are all in black and white photos. I think a paragraph was given to headwear and footwear. It focused mainly on the tunic and its trimmings. Half the book was history, half pictoral descriptions."
5,A Great starting foundation for self-study,"I bought this book in 2008, and in the year afterwards I managed to make my way through both vol.1 and vol.2 and with what I had learned from these books I was able to easily pass all my Japanese classes up to level 4. I do however recommend Tuttle's guide to remembering Japanese characters to help supplement the Kanji portion of your studies."
3,Elementary Japanese Vol 1,"I use this book to review what I have already learned from GENKI 1. This book is simple to follow; but, this book is strange in some parts...in chapter 2 it teaches how to say American words with a Japanese accent. Shouldn't it, instead, teach the actual Japanese word? Examples from the book: Vegetable- bejitaburu (actually ""yasai"" in Japanese, but it doesn't tell you that) or Boat- booto (actually ""fune"" in Japanese, but it doesn't tell you that). So if you want a great book to learn from (that doesn't add a bunch of unnecessary extras) buy Genki 1. Buy this book only if you want a variety. Also, the CD that comes with this book is great."
1,My song is not on this album,"Although the songs on this album are grrrrreat but I was looking for The Invisible Man's Band, All Night Thang and this album pops up and the song is not listed. What's up with that????????????????"
3,Not a bagen but grat,It wil bee yousefll two me!!I have sen it an i lik it i wil get mi on copii...I prefr ta gett it cheep!!MechWarior3 Pirats Mon is me favrit gam!!!Wow man!!
4,Nice watch!,"Great watch and I love the color! I don't know how long the band will last, but I've worn it everyday since I received it."
2,Disappointing and convoluted.,"I am sorry, but that is what the majority of the novel is like. The excitement and interest that is pandemic in The Mote In God's Eye is almost, mind you ALMOST, nowhere to be found, though it does have its moments. Gripping Hand's storyline is convoluted and confusing at many points, the characters, some of whom are from T.M.I.G.E. are completely uninteresting and droll or have become so in transition from Mote to Hand. Obscure and boring references to the history of Asia Minor did not help. A poor sequel."
4,The Mote in God's Eye II,"I read the first book in this series (can you have a series with only two books?),The Mote in God's Eyeabout 2 years ago, and until recently, I didn't realize there was a sequel. When I found out, I quickly tracked it down.To be honest, I don't remember the characters all that well from the first book - I wouldn't wait years between them if you don't have to. And while this sequel does take awhile to get going, I don't understand all of the negative reviews about it. It's a good story, and interesting. I like how the aliens here are asymmetrical, mysterious and quietly sinister. Plus the hard science of how they travel between systems is neat (a different take than the usual lightspeed or hyperspace route).Will it take 18 years for another sequel to come out? Who knows, but I remain a fan. Recommended to anyone who loved the first."
3,Could have been better written,"The first book was excellent and I was glad to read it. This one is not written well but is still worth the read. It seems like the author just didn't think a lot of the details through. People will start ideas in the dialogue and never complete them. The intrigues between the moties and humans are interesting but seem to take nonsensical turns. I reread passages many times and referred to the cast of characters in the back to see if I missed things, but didn't manage to make sense of the, In the end I just continued to read sometimes things cleared up, sometimes they did not, generally it didn't seem to matter. There are also a lot of false starts and several unnecessary characters. The authors have a rough draft of a good book here. I am surprised that these two great authors would be this sloppy with such an important property. I hope they read this review and rewrite this book."
3,The beam in your own,"How do you write a sequel to one of the greatest books in the sf canon? Maybe you shouldn't.Oh, come on, we're being unfair. This would be an okay book if we weren't comparing it to _Mote in God's Eye_...or, in fact, anything Niven and Pournelle have written without carrying Michael Flynn on their backs. It's okay, all right? In fact, it's pretty good. This book is pretty good. Pretend it stands on its own."
2,Extremely disappointing in light of its predecessor,"It pains me to confess that I was very disappointed with the Gripping Hand especially because I really enjoyed The Mote in God's Eye. The Mote was a classic work of Science Fiction, one which has all the elements of a great book. It is gripping, exciting, intriguiing and internally consistent - a real page-turner. The sequel on the other hand, is boring and trivial. The characters are cardboard cutouts who lack depth and intellingence. The story is boring and captures none of the original excitement - we don't get to learn anything new about the Moties or their civilization. I would definitely not recommend buying this book - rather reread the original."
3,The Gripping Hand,I read this originally quite a few years ago and was delighted by it as a follow up of the original novel. I was just as pleased with it this time around. A fascinating story of alien contact and the ways in which different elements react to these circumstances.
1,crap,"Do not buy this book. I loved mote in gods eye, so I bought this without reading reviews. This book could have been one chapter and said everything new in it. It is a shame that they just threw something together to make a dollar. I paid 7.00 for this book and would have felt ripped of at .50 cents."
3,The Motie version of the Eveready battery... it goes on and on and on...,"The Mote in God's Eye... fantastic!The Gripping Hand... the authors are getting paid by the word?I know, this is too critical. The first 75% of this book is what I expected... MORE of the Moties, and their interations with themselves and humans. The slow chase through the Sister and the Crazy Eddie Point... enough already! I still don't understand this long, drawn-out experience. What was happening with the fleet? Or on the planet? ANYTHING BUT THIS SLOW MOTION CHASE.Oh, and did I say I've still read this book four times?I'm waiting for the movie!"
3,"At times it was exciting, but...","Too much of this book focused on issues that did not appeal to me. In fact at least half of the book did not even feel like it was Science Fiction. Some of the story-lines took crazy turns, if for no other reason than to ""try"" to keep the reader interested. The last hundred pages or so were fairly exciting. The final battle was good, but the ending was rushed. I can understand how the author(s) were trying to show us how humans may react to another species (all the long drawn out dialogue of Bury and others), or am I giving the authors too much credit? I still gave the book 3 stars because it peaked my interest at times, but I would have liked to see more focus on the Motie Civilization, and not little human soap operas playing themselves out in space."
3,Not as good as I thought it would be,"The Mote in God's Eye had a fairly original story that kept me intrigued. The sequel, though, fails to provide the same excitement. Part of it is due to annoying staccato dialogue and sudden jumps in logic that leave the reader behind."
3,Mediocre and takes forever to get started,"Mediocre. 200 of the 400 pages are spent in a boring introduction without much happening. When the story finally moves to the Moties and the pacing increases, there were so many highly improbable coincidences that I found it hard to continue reading the story. The characters lack depth, but if you have already read ""The mote in God's eye"", you were probably expecting that. I suggest you read the excellent ""Footfall"" by the same authors instead."
1,UN-Gripping Novel,Mote in Gods Eye was one of the most interesting first contact novels I had read for a long time - with some truly alien aliens. So it was with a great sense of anticipation that i read the gripping hand.Words fail me.This book is nothing compared to Mote - and if you have'nt read Mote it is extremely confusing. All in all I wish I hadn't read it as it spoiled some of my 'internal' vision of how the Motie Society would progress.
1,I wish it were possible to un-read a book,"To put it simply, this novel is a large brown stinking turd. Every bad thing said in every other review is utterly true, it's not nearly as good as the first attempt by those famous million monkeys with a million typewriters. As a LONG time fan and reader of Niven's works, whose stories led me down fascinating paths of amazing storytelling, fantastic worlds and fascinating characters in my youth, it really does break my heart to realize that two writers who had so much talent and ability to create interesting stories have fallen this far, and I hate that all those great memories have been capped by this. I pray they realize their careers are over and just gracefully retire. Don't waste your time and money with this, if you really need a book to read grab the dictionary instead - the random words you find will make a more cogent plot and enjoyable story."
1,Worth waiting 18 years for? NOT!!,"Seems that I'm a little harder to please than old T. C. The only reason that I gave this weak work a 2 is just because it's Niven. Otherwise, I would never have finished it. The Mote In God's Eye is one of the great works in SF. The best extrapolation of what an alien race trapped in their own solar system would be forced to evolve into in order to survive. Oh, sorry, I got carried away about a piece of GREAT fiction, not this garbage. Reading the phone book is more exciting. A forced sequel that the writers obviously could not have put their hearts into. Read Mote again and dream up your own sequel, you can't do any worse than this"
4,It's a sequel,"I enjoy the work of these two authors, both individually and as a team. But as a follow-up to The Mote in God's Eye this was slightly disappointing. It was that typical sequel which is a bit less exciting than the first book. My expectations were probably too high but in any event they were not completely met.None of this is to say the novel was bad. The characters were well-developed, the created universe was interesting and the Moties were a smart creation by men who know their job and do it well. However, the book had sequelitis and that can't really be overcome.By all means read the book. It is fun and interesting. Just don't expect another The Mote in God's Eye."
2,"eBook Excrutiating, buy physical copy","I read this book in paper multiple years ago, found it interesting, but a slog. There is a statement during a chase that embodied my feelings at the time... and you will know it when you find it.I found a first edition of the MIGE a couple of weeks ago, and found large pieces of it to be a slog too.However the ebook is far worse. There are line breaks all over, making a complete hash of the flow of the story. I don't dare get the MIGE in ebook for fear it will be worse.The two stars are for my overall experience, I'd give the physical book three stars because my expectations, but I have a strong suspicion that it would be zero if I only had the ebook.I STRONGLY recommend not getting the eBook."
2,"Not so much a completion as an abandonment of ""The Mote""","Perhaps, had I not read this book's predecessor (""The Mote in God's Eye,""), I might rate it more highly. This book involves the same characters, but they seem to be running in neutral; there are no new science toys, no new cosmology, no new species, little in the way of new culture, nothing to surprise or invite thought. What is here is a trivial resolution of that supposedly-irresolvable conundrum which was the ""Mote"" in God's eye, a casual and thorough disregard for the ""beam"" it disclosed in our own; and the intriguing new philosophical construct of the title, shrunken down to a simple faith that such trivializing solutions are always possible."
2,"Larry, what have you done?","The Mote in God's Eye is a classic. It flowed flawlessly and kept my attention from start to finish. The Gripping Hand however, did not. If it were not for the winter being in full effect when I recieved this book, it would have never been finished. I found it to be a few pages of riviting action surrounded by hundreds of pages of disjointed boring babble that ultimately had little to do with the overall story. It got so bad that by the end I would not have been surprised if John Wayne himself led the cavalry charge. This book rates a very weak three based on the insight into the moties, and for the talent of the writers, even though it wasn't used here. Rewrite!"
2,This book was easy to put down.,"I was very disappointed in this book. As a big fan of theMote In God's Eye (I have recommended it to many manypeople, all of whom have thanked me) I was bored to tearswith this book. In fact, I put it down when halfwaythrough and then ended up starting it over because it hadbeen so long. I finished the book only out of loyalty toNiven (I usually devour his books), and out of the hopethat perhaps it would improve. The story line was veryslow to develop, and the ending, I thought was complicatedand difficult to follow."
2,"OK, I guess.","""The Gripping Hand"" is an OK sequel to ""The Mote in God's Eye"", I guess. But, I was not all that happy with it. I know these writers are capable of better story-telling than this and marked it a little low, because of my disappointment. ""Mote"" had a good deal of 'action'. This sequel has less action and more beating around the bush. There are plenty of words. But, they do not seem to add up to much in this story. I got through the story, but had to wonder: ""So what?"" for a bit.Who knows? Perhaps Niven got tired for a while? Some of that 'tiredness' ahows in some of his solo works from this time. Who knows? What I do know is that this book could have and should have been better."
4,A Worthy Sequel,"I was well pleased with this novel. The Mote in God's Eye was one of the best science fiction novels that I have ever read -and The Gripping Hand is well plotted, and has the return of some of the most entertaining characters along with interesting insights into life in the empire and the Moties. A Must Read if you liked The Mote in God's Eye as much as I did !"
1,Worse Than The First One!,Unfortunately I had the sequel to The Mote In God's Eye because I gotten both at the same time from the Science Fiction Book Club. Boy was I in for a chore.The Moties were about to escape their system and would be able to do battle with the humans. I just plain thought this book was a bore. I will not be reading anything by these two again.
4,"Not quite as good as the original, but good none the less","Oh come on, of course it's not as good as TMiGE... but few books are!! If you don't like this book, you've got rocks in your head."
1,Don't bother,"One of the poorest examples of science fiction I've ever come across. It's hard to believe that it was turned out by Niven and Pournelle. Must have been ghost written by a couple of seventh graders- no, make that fourth graders."
3,Average scifi,"I have to agree with other reviewers. This book is not that great. I truly enjoyed ""The Mote in God's Eye"", a masterpiece, and was eager to go back to its universe. Unfortunately, ""The Gripping Hand"" is a tedious exercise of authorship. The book is divided into two parts. The first one prepares the actual action in which the moties are involved (no spoiler, this is very predictable). It is just an unbearable tale of space politics and average character development with very little action. The second half is more interesting, and it does make use of some slick ideas, but the story is too fragmented to be exciting. In summary, Larry and Jerry wasted a couple of good ideas, and a lot of the credit they gained from ""The Mote""."
1,Horribly boring and unbelievable,"I bought this book to read it on a long flight. Man, this made the flight even longer! I could NOT believe that two of my favourite authors could write such a horrible book so I had to read the entire thing, hoping it would get better... It didn't. Looking at the window of the laundry washing machine is more interesting than reading this book. I actually threw it away in disgust - I could have sold it but I did not want to do that to a fellow human being.I'm a huge fan of Niven's earlier work, and like ""The mote"" very well; but most of his later work is uninspired and boring, and this one takes the cake."
1,Maybe you should save your money,"10-in. stainless open skillet - CuisinartIn spite of meticulous attention to directions, and repeated attempts to follow those directions, I am unable to fry ANYthing without sticking! The one item I am successful with are ocean scallops. I must be doing something wrong, but I sure don't know what it is!I've just ordered the same size skillet in Calphalon. Non-stick of course!!!"
3,Good pan,"I bought this a while ago, and it's a good pan. The only complaint I have is that it turned a bright gold/amber colour the first time I used it. Maybe I used too much heat on the stove. Either way, I had to buy Barkeeper's Friend to clean it up. Luckily, after several washes, it returned to its original colour. I really hope I don't have to do this every time I use this pan."
4,Fine Little Omelet Pan,"I bought this pan to make omelets, which we hadn't made in several years. Now I have to remember how to cook omelets properly. But it's a very nice pan and I have no doubt it will work just fine."
4,We love stainless cookware,We just switched to stainless cookware about a year ago and love it. This piece will just add to the versatility of the set we already have
3,Too Big,"Through my own lack of insight, I had to return this skillet because it was just too big to be practical. None of my burners on my glass-top range were big enough to heat it evenly and it just was not what I needed."
4,14 inch open skillet,it is a very very large skillet that goes very nicely from the stove top into the oven. I like it very much
5,Perfect weight,A versatile medium size frying pan that heats evenly and cleans up with only an occasional use of BarKeepers Freind to maintain appearnace.
3,"Even heat, great to cook with, difficult to keep clean","It's top notch skillet, that cooks evenly. My issue is that as with most stainless steel cookware - they get dirty with burn marks, the ones that are unremovable. And the stains/left over residues that are removable - require a lot of work to be cleaned. After only 3 times I have used it I had to clean it methodically with vinegar and baking soda in order to bring it back to a 85% clean condition. The rest of the 15% will forever stay there..."
2,sticky stickiness,"everything sticks in here unless you use a ton of oil. it cleans up fine but isn't very useful, except very low stick items, like grill cheese or a hotdog. I never use it on more than medium heat. Even when I use a lot of oil - and I usually use coconut oil, which has the highest smoke point of any except maybe lard - stuff still tends to stick. I recommend a PFOA-free non-stick pan instead, like Regal Ware, also available on Amazon. I bought the stainless for its longevity, but if it is useless, why do you want it forever?"
3,"Good pan, no lid","I like the pan. It's HUGE.Unfortunately, although the fourth item in the product description says:""Tight fitting stainless covers seal in moisture and nutrients for healthier, more flavorful results. Also eliminates drips and spills while pouring.""This item does not come with a lid. Still haven't decided whether or not to return it, since I don't have a 14"" cover to substitute, and I don't know where I can get just a 14"" cover.I notice that some other reviewers wish it had a cover, I now wish I had spent time reading the reviews closely."
3,Pan sticks,"Inexpensive. Nice looking. Convenient size. Pan sticks, however, and that is the reason for 3 stars. Perhaps it is me, but on my glass-top stove, the pan stuck when I tried simple egg-frying. Not sure what I could do differently - pretty simple operation. I have the 14"" (great size) and it is beginning to stick too. I have the covered 10"" and it is an excellent pan and very nice looking and, for some reason, does not stick."
3,Too small and shallow,"The product is great. I agree to most of the positive reviews. Just that its too small and shallow. I thought I would be able to cook indian vegetables for two in this skillet. Unfortunately, the contents would splash and spill out of this cookware. Someone mentioned that the inside of the 8' skillet is only 6.5' -- and I totally agree to that."
