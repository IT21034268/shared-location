1,Save your money,"Film was too dark too really see much for a majority of the film, not enough nudity or violence......save your moneyand your time find something else."
1,"Poor product, poor service","I have owed my CardiSport Fusion 10 for ten months and it has been erratic the whole time. The chest strap requires a new battery about once each month. Now the monitor portion has stopped working altogether -- right in the middle of a workout the display went blank. New battery does not solve the problem. The email address listed for service bounces back -- unknown address. And the telephone number given allows you to leave a voice mail, but they do not return calls. This is the second time I have tried to contact them. Maybe if you contact CardioSport in the UK, they can get their US representative to notice you. Better yet, go with some other brand."
5,Buy this book!,"I bought two copies of this for my daughters. My 11 year old didn't want to put it down! She has already read it cover to cover! My 9 year old has read some of it, but hasn't shown as much interest. She still prefers her story Bible. It may not be a true ""Bible"", but it's a step above story Bibles in that it contains actual scripture. The way I look at it, they are getting some of God's actual words while learning the general background on other topics. If it spurs their interest, then great! God's word will not return void--you'll always get something out of it!"
2,Disappointed,"I got it 'cause there was a report recently that children learn things very well in the ""comic"" format. I feel the book should be 2 separate book, Old Testament & New Testament. My grandkids will probably try to read from the front and the Old Testament names are so hard that it is distracting from the morals of the stories. Not sure what to do. I got one for each grandson and I guess I will go ahead and give them to them for Christmas."
3,Dissappointed,"I loved the idea of a bible that would spark the interest of God in my 6 year old stepson. It was a graduation gift for him. But after a few hours of opening the book , it fell off of the cover. It must have been real old. I didnt have super glue on hand so he took it home as is. Much dissappointment."
4,Loved it while it lasted,"My son loved reading this book. Unfortunately, it wasnt made well and fell apart so we cant share it with others."
4,Good for purpose purchased April 2010,16aug10I purchased this book in April 2010 for a lady in our adult Sunday School Class. Although she is 70 her mind did not develop beyond age 7. She can't read but this book calms her and helps her feel like a part of the class.I read the other reviews before purchase. As they pointed out; if I was looking for something to read to my grandchild I would choose something else.
2,picture prejudice?,"Just based on looking at the sample pages provided by the Amazon website, I noticed that the ""good guys"" all have lighter hair and sometimes lighter skin, the ""bad guys"" have dark hair, and incidental characters have dark hair or darker skin. This is a very unfortunate subliminal message of color prejudice for children."
3,"Not for me, but some good qualities","These strings sound really good and punchy on a G+L L-2000 and Squier VM Jazz. I would say they are a little higher tension than I like. I've tried both the Medium's and the Light's and they both feel a little stiff to me, although honestly, the sound is so good that I end up having fun for a couple of hours straight after I first put them on. It's just feels a little more strenuous to play for extended periods, but they do really allow you to dig in. I think it's probably personal preference more than anything else - I just prefer slightly less tension, so I'm continuing my search."
1,WARNNG! Do not buy from this seller!,"On March 1st I ordered and my on March 15th credit card was charged for two fax film cartridges - they were promised by March 22 at the latest. These items were not received. I have made several attempts to contact the seller: the first he responded that he'd resend the items immediately; the second, third and fourth he ignored completely. I would caution any future buyer to avoid this seller completely. Litigation for satisfaction of this theft/purchase would be costlier than the value of the charge although I'm concerned for the security of my credit card."
4,Great Learning Experience,A great instructional video. A great beginner to advance. Showed me some tricks I never learnt before. I didn't rate it 5 star because some of the lighting and angle was not that great. Too much reflection on the subject. A great instructor showing detailed works.
2,Worthless for MP3 Discs,"This is a nice cd player with good sound at a reasonable price, which you should consider if you only want to play regular cd disks. However, if you want to use this for MP3 format disks, forget about it.I bought this for my mom and she told me that it would not play the tracks of MP3 cds I had made for her in the correct track order. She contacted Panasonic who could not figure out the problem and had her send it to them for repair. She got it back, and it still didn't play tracks in order. Then I discovered that for some odd reason, this player will only play MP3 tracks in the correct order if they are named properly, example, 001.mp3, 002.mp3, etc. Seems odd that Panasonic employees couldn't figure this out. I use Roxio to burn disks and I cannot name tracks in this way. I have owned a number of MP3 cd players and this is the only one I have owned which won't play tracks in order.I have purchased my mom a Sony MP3 cd player and I suggest that you do the same."
1,Not very accurate,"The mechanism inside the step counter is ""loose"" so any movement adds steps. Also, the counter is on the side, as opposed to the top, and is difficult to read when you're wearing it. For the money - it's not worth a second look."
5,Surprised to get so much from this book,"What a fantastic book! I don't know what I was expecting, but not such a rich compendium of resources and ideas for aspiring travellers. It has an attractive mix of formal and informal (personal) information from the author's experience. And it's good read too! I've been dipping in at various points and forming a picture that way. It works. I can see the busy reader who doesn't want a novel, and only wants to find the best way to the metaphorical departure lounge. The reader will be informed, encouraged, enabled by this book, as I was!I'm putting this on my Christmas list for all teenage people I know, who could use an exotic, creative experience."
5,Inspirational Book!,"This book is wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone! The author writes on a personal level like she is talking to you and it is also written from a emotional level so it is easy to understand. This book gets you excited about all the possibilities and the author explains any fears you may have and how you can get over them and overall she gets the word across to never give up! She also gives e-mail adresses from other people who have experience travel. This is a great book, everyone can benefit from this."
5,60's Eclectic Collection,"I've been looking for Sopwith Camel's ""Hello, Hello"", everywhere. I figured it was too obsure to find. Not so. Once I saw that, along with Ketty Lester's terrific ""Love Letters, ""The End of the World"", and the only song I know with a verb conjugation, "" Grazing in the Grass"", this collection sounded like a good bet. Some different selections,like Floyd Kramer's piano piece, ""Last Date"", "" Moon River"" by Henry Mancini, along with the usual rock staples like the Guess who and the Lovin' Spoonful. All original recordings by the original artists. Highly recommended, especially at this price."
3,50's are Better,Apparently not what I expected. It was okay but I think my cousin who was part of the 60's much more than I will enjoy it more.
3,Solid but unspectacular collection...,"There are a few hard-to-find hits here but, otherwise, you get ""common"" oldies. The sound is acceptable; the whole thing would have fit on one disc."
4,bought for a couple loved it all,I originally bought it because of a couple of hard to find songs. After I started listening to it I found I remembered a good number of the songs. Love the entire collection and would recommend it to any one who enjoys that period of music
2,NOT ALL Mac compatible!,"Be warned, despite the product description, not all the games included are Mac compatible. The Oregon Trail 5 and Liberty's Kids games work, which are okay games, nicely updated, maybe a little boring. However, ClueFinders and Where in the USA is Carmen Sandiego do NOT work. These are reasons I bought the pack."
2,Jumping Cursor,"I purchased this mouse to use with the computer I use everyday. It was easy enough to install and felt good in my hand. I don't know about the buttons, mostly because I've never really used them anyway - but really didn't use the mouse long enough to consider them. The first day of installation I noticed the cursor jumping. I put new batteries in (instead of the rechargeable batteries that come with it) and tried again - still jumped. So I decided to put the rechargeable batteries back in and let it charge for 24 hours. It still jumped!!! This caused many problems, as I play a multi-player game online and at one point the cursor jumped to the X before I realized it and I clicked myself out of the game completely - not a good thing. I sent it back."
4,Rechargeable Mouse,This rechargeable mouse is as good as any with the added plugin power supply i like it more than the ones that get power from the usb becouse it stays powered up to keep a charge on batterys when in cradle and don't stop the charge with computer off.NOTE: don't bang the mouse or drop it my last one stoped working after being droped this is true of any optical mouse.
4,Addictive,"I have had this mouse for a year now, and I am quite addicted to the forward and back buttons. I love the design...it fits perfectly in my hand and the two extra buttons are in exactly the right places.It is inconvenient to recharge the thing, but all cordless electronic devices have to be recharged, so I just deal with it."
3,Not too bad,"whichever you are right handed or left handed, you can use it.but i used to use a mouse for right handed. so this mouse is kind of annoying cuz of the shape. the forward button places on left side and the backward button is on right side. it's hard to click forward button with a ring finger... I mean,,, not too hard but not so easy.however, it's not a big problem. I dont wanna spend much money for a optical wireless mouse. so, i guess cost-performance is really good."
1,not so good,"does not automatic synchronize the signal; if it has been awhile since you last use the mouse, need to put the mouse back to its stand for it to resynchronize - this really bothers me. (actually, it's unbearable for me) Send it back after a few usages."
4,Its a battery,"what more can you say about a battery. It makes my ratchet go. Seriously though it has great battery life, i'm able to use my ratchet for hours on end without the need for a recharge. I have no complaints."
4,Not what you think,This is a new aussie band they're really good. Its a really catchy song and great to listen to. This song is the song that people remember the band by try it out you won't be dissapionted.Their 2nd single Life's a movie is just as good can't wait till they release a their album
5,Great books destined to become a classic,"This is a great book!!! It's written with irony and clearly displays the author's extensive knowledge in different areas. Being myself a scholar, I higly recommend this volume to whoever is interested in expanding his knowledge in European(but not only European) studies."
3,deficient straps and buckles,I went out snowshoeing but I spent more time rebuckling the straps than I did enjoying the snow. This size snowshoe is not for any snow deeper than 6 inches.
1,Dissapointed,Not at all what I expected.....I can't get the straps to stay tight....I would like to return them.
2,Very unuseful; do not buy,"I bought this book before going over to the Netherlands for a business trip. I found the book VERY confusing and VERY unusable. The pronunciation guide is very misleading. For example, it leads you to think that the ""n"" at the end of every word should be pronounced as ""u"" as in bus, which is totally untrue. The content is arranged in dictionary format, and is thus unhelpful at all for the beginner. I highly recommend AGAINST this book. BTW, most people in the Netherlands can understand and many can speak English, so if you go over there for a short stay, you don't need to learn Dutch at all."
3,I would rate it about 3 and a half stars,"I think only one of these shorts is really funny (GOIN' FISHIN', which is about a bus trip) but the rest aren't bad and have some good moments, especially THE BIG PREMIERE, which has the Gang making an amateur movie. UNEXPECTED RICHES has them digging for buried treasure and COME BACK MISS PIPPS is about their beloved, unjustly-fired teacher.There are a few moments of ethnic stereotyping - in RICHES, Buckwheat passes out free watermelon and fried chicken to a black neighborhood, and in PREMIERE he briefly plays Robinson Crusoe's Friday (although dressed like himself, as it's a sloppy production) in the home-movie, but they come across as mild, especially in the context of Our Gang, which in 1942 was providing almost (maybe not even almost) the only Hollywood films that portrayed black and white friends interacting as equals."
1,The Worst of Spanky,"This MGM compilation represents a pale shadow of the classic Hal Roach shorts. When Roach sold the Our Gang series to MGM in 1938, the creative decline became painfully evident. These one-reel travesties lack the charm and spontaneity of the Roach efforts - underscoring MGM's sledgehammer approach to slapstick comedy. Spanky, Alfalfa and company were badly served in these joyless endeavors."
4,hmmmm...???,"Just saw this group in SF, liked them and their energy so got the CD at the show. But, the CD was vastly different from what I saw on stage. Their stage show was definitely Stereolabish, especially with the two girls' vocal parts (on every song), but the CD doesn't have any vocals. Still, the CD is good, fresh, and I would highly recommend seeing them live!"
3,Meh...At least it is a hard cover.,I was pleased to find out it was a hard cover screen. But dismayed to find that only 1 panel was different from the VtR screen.
4,Useful for a beginner,"I bought this for my wife, as she was going to ST for the first time, and she has found it to be very useful. The information on it is very useful for those who have not memorized the rules yet, altough I have less use for it, as I have a firm grasp of the rules, and I know where to flip in the book to find the relevent passage. I will say, however, that even then it has sped up my own sessions some, if I can't remember, say, the bonus on a transformation or something like that."
5,Great way to give your audio equipment a workout....,The picture quality is great with all 3 movies with Tokyo Drift being the best looking. The audio is freaking outstanding on all 3 movies. I listen to these movies with my audio dial about half way of what I normally use for other movies and its louder than all of them.
4,Fast-Furious-Blu,"If you love fast, fixed up racing cars, then this trilogy is definitely for you. These movies just got so much better on blu-ray, worth every penny of my hard earned money. The third installment really surprised me, it so much better than I anticipated. Video/audio quality - EXCELLENT !!! Highly recommend it. Enjoy Folks!"
1,Great deal.....if you want part of the collection!,"Now as much as I ""love"" these crappy movies, when I buy a set on blu-ray, or dvd for that matter I expect for the whole thing to be there. I have back to the future... all 3 movies are there. I have robocop... all 3 of them. F&F... 3 of the 4. So now I can buy this and have ""some"" of the collection, or wait until they sell through these and make a 4 pack. I'll wait ;)"
1,sound is horrible,The sound quality of these blu-rays is HORRIBLE! It is absolutely aweful!!! Do not buy these!!! Every other blu-ray that I have plays fine with great audio quality.
4,GREAT DEAL,THE FAST & FURIOUS TRILOGY IS A GREAT DEAL ON BLU-RAY. I PRICED SEPARATELY AN DAT WALMART AND AMAZON.COM HAS BEST PRICE.
5,"Great quality, BD Live doesn't work","After buying several Blu-rays and being completely let down on picture quality (Gone in 60 Seconds!!!!), I was debating whether to even get this. I really only wanted the original F&F;, but obviously they don't want single sales.I got this from a B&M; store (instant gratification...) and was mildly surprised with the picture and sound quality (although my audio setup is not yet so great).I have the Sony BDP-S350 with the 2.0 firmware update (or so I thought) and the BD-Live does NOT work on any disc. I don't really care, but it would have been cool to see what the fuss is all about.Image quality: 8/10Audio quality: 7.5/10 (not a 7.1 setup though!)Packaging: 5/10 (didn't care for some parts of the packaging)"
3,No Digital Copy,"I brought this product on July 15th, 2010. All movies included a digital copy...Yeah right. The digital copy expired on 3/31/2010, after I purchased the item. I contacted Universal Digital copy support for the digital copy and they sent me an email stating ""Unfortunately this feature has officiall ben discontinued."" This is bogus!"
3,Digital Copys have expired,While I enjoy the movies thru my Blu-ray player part of the reason I got this set was to have digital copies to play on my ipad. All of the codes EXPIRED IN MARCH 2010. This info really needs to be put in the main product description
5,great,"nice! get all 3 movies and when i bought it, it was on sale which made it better. also a reviewer said the digital copes didn't work, i tried mine and they did. they say they expired in 2009 but they still worked so give them a try nice thing is they all have their own case so i don't have to use the box, and the cases have the original covers on them instead a smaller version in a little box on the front surrounded by a sold color. all in all a vary good buy"
3,Humdrum Compared to Others,"Alice in the Know was more of a filler novel than anything. Naylor couldn't very well skip an entire summer of Alice's life. Out of her obligation comes a mostly uneventful novel.However, the last chapter of the novel (""And Life Goes On"") was very touching and emotionally empathetic--some of Naylor's best writing. I found myself tearing up.In short, you can skip this novel, except for, again, the last chapter. Alice does two things in this book. She gets a job different from the one at the Melody Inn, and she goes to the beach. To keep up with the plot, you will need to know about what happens with Lester's most recent girlfriend, and who ends up having a worse summer than Alice. Other than that, you can skip to the much juicier Dangerously Alice, which proves to be a milestone in the series."
5,great book!!,My daughter loves this book. She needed to purchase it for a class report. She cant read it enough. Enjoy the reading.
3,"nice guitar, but not the 45's you remember","It is obvious listening to the sound samples thatthese are not the original recordings you may remember, but various covers, remakes, and live performances. That said, like any Ventures collection, it will provide listeners with a textbook for playing rock guitar."
4,Wallace,"The first thing that I noticed was that the pole trimmer that I received was labeled as Fiskars not a Wallace, same part number and I suspect that all the different trimmers are made by just a few companies. The blade trimmer worked very well cutting branches up to about one and a quarter inches, you really have to pull to cut them that big or larger but that's what kind of leverage you get with a 6"" lever arm, they're all like that. The saw blade is pretty flimsy and trying to cut a 3"" branch at full extension is nearly impossible. The tool locked to full extension easily and held well. The unit is lightweight but seems strong enough for home use."
3,Does the job but,"This product does what it was made to do. For myself, I couldn't handle anything with more weight but if you could, you'd be better off with it. When stretched to it's full length, it get's a bit flimsy and hard to manage. I will say it cuts. My arm strength is apparently limited because I'm unable to pull the rope(which is a bit short) hard enough to use that feature but the saw works well. A decent buy for the price."
1,junk,"Used it once on a single tree, fell apart before I was done pruning.The long saw blade is thin and flexes a lot, making sawing difficult. The cutting portion of it snapped in half during use (the metal hook broke in two pieces!),and finally when bringing it back in the collapse/expand locks broke.Total junk"
3,it is okay,"The saw is good, however the made was not that impressive. The side screw was not tight enough to hold the extension piece and then it broke. I couldn't extend it anymore until I bought a bigger screw and put it in to be able to hold the two pieces then it started working better. I like how sharp the saw is but having to deal with that right after I received it was a bummer."
4,Just what I needed,"I have a fence line that's lined with small trees and I needed something to prune the tops and high branches. This pruner did the job and did it well. I had read some negative reviews on this product, but the truth is this is a $32 tree pruner. You are not going to be able to take it out with you everyday to make a living or to cut down a 5"" diameter limb. But if you need something a couple times a year just to keep your property looking good, it's worth every penny of the $32.The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the lock on the extension clamp. The clamp works great but you need a screw driver or pocket knife to pull the lock lever over a raised notch to loosen the clamp. I just don't like having to have a tool to operate another tool. Other than that it works great."
5,tree trimmmer,works great and meets my needs perfectly! great price and good quality replaces an old pruner. will not hesitate to use seller in future
5,Intriguing insights to our governmental operations,"Behan explains in fascinating detail many of the quirks -- mostly intentional -- that make our government behave today the way it does. The convoluted process that got George Bush elected is only a glimpse of the deep issues. He explains how it is virtually impossible, and has been since our foundation, to say we have rule by majority in our government. This is all explored from a foundation of federal land policy, but applies equally to the rest of our governmental operations. It was eye opening, and angering, to learn how we got where we are."
4,motivation that works,a great book. a must read for anyone that wants to improve their quality of life. i enjoyed the use of quotes. this book has inspired me to be more pro-active in life and business. Zev has put it all in one place.
5,Wonderful chair.,Purchased this chair for my grandson. We saw it originally in a park attached to a picnic table and thought WOW What a good idea!! Searched on Amazon and there it was. This chair puts little people right up to the table with everyone else. It's also a great space saver instead of the big high chairs!!! They have used it now for a year and a half and love it.
4,Really love this stuff!,"This is one of those products that is a very nice surprise when you use it. The clothes just smell wonderful (really scents the air outside too while they're drying!) and it helps with color retention. I've used this Downy for about 4 years now, along with a couple other scents and it doesn't clog my dispenser cup in my washer as much as other products do. Had a terrible time with Snuggle doing that so I longer use that product. Wish this would help more with static in the winter but if you use it with a dryer cloth, that helps a ton. Highly recommend!"
3,Made to accompany the liquid Tide,"This product has a light fragrance that does not irritate my allergies. Many scents, whether added fragrances or just the smell of the product's ingredients reek havoc with my sinuses and skin. This one, fortunately, does not.If I could, I would give it three and a half stars, because some clothes have static when I take them out of the dryer. Also, if it gets on dark fabric, it can stain.I almost forgot, the laundry does come out of the dryer soft."
4,"Skill required, but worth it.","I am a product engineer, used to tiny screws, but the Palm Tungsten T3 is not designed for service by the average user. The new battery restored life to my Palm, but there were many things that I could have done wrong in the reinstallation. I am happy to have done it, but others may end up with a basket of parts."
4,This is going to be a great one!!,"This is very different from most step tapes, but I'm a pretty experienced stepper and it took me a lot of stopping and rewinding to get some of the routines down. Once you get it down though, you're in for a lot of fun. Hugo is great!"
3,A decent realistic book,A good book on an economically wise spacecraft made from old junkyard parts and walmart parts. It is a reusable spacecraft called the SSTO. Single Stage To Orbit
3,Does the job,"Purchased for my SS3L3 compressor, this kit was convenient for extending my warranty on the compressor. I've sense upgraded from the minuscule intake filter setup that comes on the compressor from the factory (and I recommend you do the same!) so the filters included with the service kit are no longer of use to me.Also, I've found there are places to buy the same ingersoll genuine oil in full 1qt jugs for about 1/2 the price of this kit, so thats the route im taking now.In a nutshell, the kit services your compressor if its all factory and extends warranty. If its not all factory and you're still buying this 'service kit', you're wasting money so look elsewhere."
3,Not as Pictured. Probably the Same,"Seems to work fine, but im not really sure what i received...I did not receive the item shown in the picture. What I received was ""Tuf-Line Micro Coated Ice Line"". I am confident that they are from the same manufacturer. I assume that they are the same actual product with a different label but have no proof of this. I contacted the seller and they apologized and quickly sent me an identical wrong item that is not as shown in the picture. Then I gave up."
2,too small,The bathing cap seems to be made okay but it is much smaller than I expected and I can't use it. It was a mistake buying it.
1,It slides off my head,"I would expect a bathing cap to stay put when I stretch it over my head, but it doesn't. It just shrinks itself back to its original shape and becomes a loose object on top of my head."
1,Lycra bathing cap,I thought this was a waterproof bathing cap and when I received it I was gravely disappointed. I did not return the item as it would have been too much trouble for what it was worth.
3,Smaller than I expected.,"This cap was smaller than I expected. I'm hoping it stretches in the water, because it can barely keep on my hair in (I have medium-long hair). It does serve it's purpose, though. I use lycra because it feels less constricting in the water than silicon, and I get headaches less often while using it. My head also never overheats when using lycra.Color-wise, since I got the black one, it was... well, black, so no false advertising on the color on my part.All in all, it serves its purpose."
4,Does the job,"I have a big Irish head, which means that when something like a sweatband or a swimming cap is too tight, my head hurts big, too. For some reason, things that are tight on my ears give me a headache in a fairly short amount of time. Having tried latex caps and found them too tight to swim for a solid hour, I decided to swim without a cap, but it didn't take long to realize that hair in front of my goggles was nearly as irritating as a headache. I decided to try a lycra cap, and I've been pleased with the result. If you're considering this cap, remember that it does not keep your hair dry. It does, however, keep it out of your eyes. Although it isn't waterproof, it also keeps water from gushing into whichever ear(s) you tilt upward when you're doing the classic crawl stroke. I'm pleased with this purchase because of the lycra's ability to stretch comfortably over my head and its functions of keeping my hair out of my eyes and water out of my left ear."
1,great if you're a pin head,"These things will give you a headache in 2 minutes. SO SMALL. Great for a kid but not for an adult with a normal head, and I don't have any hair."
2,cheaply made arrived torn,It feels like polyester and is badly made. It arrived with one of the seams partly open a couple of inches.
3,Wet Hair,If you don't want wet hair this is not the cap for you. I was disappointed after using it in my swimming class.
2,Wet Head,The product stayed firmly on my head but didn't keep my hair dry in the pool. I wanted something that would protect my hair from the drying effects of chlorine. I gave it to a friend who said she needed something she could use as a shower cap.
1,Lycra Bathing Cap,"I purchased this in hope of keeping my long hair dry while attending swim exercise classes at the Y. I do not go underwater in these classes, just barely ""touch"" the water during exercises. There is some splashing also but overall no dunking, etc. While very comfortable this cap does NOT keep my hair dry. I am very disappointed in this purchase."
3,Quality and Color problems,"The quality is a little low - I guess you get what you pay for, that's why these are so inexpensive. What I received was a regular green cap. Nothing neon about it. I feel misled about the color. Otherwise it was just what I was expecting - I like lycra swim caps because they allow water to flow through and my head doesn't get overheated and it doesn't pull my (long) hair."
3,"Works as promised, but not for bedroom use","It does a good job as a humidifier, and does pull large dust particles from the air (definitely not a hepa filter by any means). Easy to clean, which should be done often. Interesting and simple design, but the inverted water bottle is a bit awkward to fill and load. One major downside is that every few hours the water bottle refills the water dish. It is a loud bubbling sound like the water cooler at work. It wakes me up at least once every night. Also the continuous noise from the unit is not the soothing ""white noise"" of a traditional humidifier. It is more mechanical, especially when the water level gets low."
4,DO NOT PUT IN DISHWASHER!,"The description lists that the discs are dishwasher-safe. I ASSURE YOU THEY ARE NOT! My discs look more like abstract art than function now. Until then I think this worked well, as the air and my nose and throat did not seem dry in the morning when I woke up. I think it's worth the money, just be careful with it. Be prepared to add water daily to it, however (which is possibly a good sign if your air is as dry as mine). The resevoir isn't very big. I haven't used any other similar machines, so I honestly don't know how it compares to others in water resevoir size. WIsh it was a little bigger though."
4,Efficient humidifier,"This humidifier works quietly and well. Advantages: never have to replace filters, plastic discs dissipate the water while the fan spreads the mist. Discs are machine washable. Disadvantage: the thing is huge so make sure you check the dimensions to ensure that you have enough space."
3,Trashy--But Worth A Look,"This is an erotic film starring the beautiful Sonia Braga, a.k.a. the Brazilian Marilyn Monroe.The dialogue is horrible and the plot is asinine. Braga plays a nymphomaniac who hits on guys while riding a public bus. Braga and her studs wind up ""doing it"" everywhere--under an open sewer pipe, in the backs of cars, various assorted public areas, etc.The dialogue is so bad it provokes uproarious (yet unintended) laughter. However, Braga is very beautiful. The bad dialogue and the opportunity to see Braga in various states of undress make this movie worth a look.Those who wish to see Braga in a much better role should check out ""Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands."" As Dona Flor, Braga is able to display both her beauty and acting ability in a much more satisfactory way."
2,"Great Idea, Poor Execution","My 3 year old got this for his birthday and though it is quite impressive, it just wouldn't stay together. Perhaps it is more suitable for older children that are using it more for ""model"" purposes. It's a beautiful set, just not sturdy enough for true, castle play!"
2,"Beautiful pieces, poor construction","The individual pieces of this castle are lovely - solid wood, with handpainted stonework. Unfortunately, the fit between pieces is so poor, my kit cannot hold together solidly, and is very wobbly. One innocent knight trying to see over the wall could bring the whole thing down!My castle is going back."
5,Excellent presentation,The best presentation of classical art I have seen in a long time. I suggest to produce more of this high quality video. DVD version is highly appreciated as soon as possible.
4,Nice book,"Nice EP book with a very practical approach. Very useful when begining in EP lab, nicely illustrated and realy pleasant to read !"

5,"Good, clean, pop-psychedelic fun","I tend to think of the FA's as a one-hit wonder -- which they were -- though I always liked that one hit: ""Western Union"" was a fine, fine pop song. This disc, however, brings to light the other, surprisingly enjoyable music that followed, as the band struggled to build on their commercial momentum. They shamelessly repeated the riffs and motifs of that song in follow-up singles (""Zip Code,"" for example), but they also delved into a rich lode of melodic pop, and this generously programmed, 25-song retrospective gives a nice, balanced view of their work from 1965-69. Of course they eventually shed their clean-cut image and got all druggie and psychedelic, and that's certainly half the fun. Recommended!"
4,Bread and milk.,"Just finished Penguin's Sverre Lyngstad translation of Hunger which includes extensive notes and a thorough bio. Interesting to read from one of the other reviewers some concerns about the authenticity of the bio (See ""Just a comment. from May 8, 2003).More importantly, this is a tremendous read from over 100 years ago that feels surprisingly contemporary and is magnificent in its exploration of pride and deprivation."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"i'm puzzled as to how it has gone so unacknowledged that this book plagiarizes the opening portion of Dostoyevsky's Crime And Punishment before the titular crime. the impoverished writer narrating his wandering of the city, losing his grip on reality as he tries to reason his way out of his predicament. i find it ridiculous that this novella is considered a significant literary work when it's just a watered down rehash of a far more potent writer's ideas. there's no question that this book would not exist if Hamsum had not read Crime And Punishment."
2,Clever but poorly constructed,"This is a great and clever toy, however it is very poorly constructed and broke apart quickly, much to my son's dismay. Melissa and Doug toys are wonderful and classic in their design, but as a general rule, do not hold up well to regular wear and tear."
1,Stay away....,"I purchased this fire truck for my grandson's 3rd birthday. Within a week one of the axles broke off at the wheel. Not something easily fixed, if at all. I've purchased two other toys from Melissa and Doug and both of them have broken within a week also.I'm done with them."
1,"Great idea, poorly constructed.","I gave this firetruck to my son for Christmas.After about 6 weeks the first glued-on piece came off. Now after 10 weeks I am ready to throw this expensive toy out, as pieces are coming off faster than I can glue them back on.We have a lot of Melissa & Doug toys, but this is by far the most expensive however cheapest designed one. Would not buy this again."
2,Great idea,":( My 2 year old twins loved this toy out of the box. Kept them busy for quite awhile. Until it fell apart. The light bar snapped off within hours of play even though it wasn't rough play. Overall it is not a very sturdy item.Back to the drawing board with this one ! The latches are excellent learning tools, but the toy needs to be sturdily constructed in order to operate them.Cannot recommend this one."
1,Doesn't work for me,I own a small studio and wax men and women everyday. This product didn't work for me - it doesn't really remove anything.I use all GiGi products and love them but this one was really a waste of my money.
2,Not very good,"I felt this lotion was a waste of money. You have to use a lot and rub it in very hard to get it off. The wax rolls up and eventually comes off. Even then, you can feel the residue still there. Azulene Oil Aftercare By Parissa is much better."
3,Harsh on Sensitive Skin,"This product dissolves hair, but may irritate sensitive skin. Please use with caution as the stated instructions suggest."
1,Baby oil works just as well.,"This is a waste of money. It does smell good and has a pleasant lotion feel, but it is would be more cost effective to just use baby oil."
1,Waste of money,"It did not work at all for me. First time user. Loved other Gigi products, but this didn't remove the extra I missed. I had to use olive oil, which I saw on internet to use, and it worked much better. Save your money."
1,Bogus..does not work at all,"I don't know how this thing works for others, but for me this just does not work. I applied the lotion to an area which has residual wax and attempted to wipe it off with paper towel and it did nothing. I have attempted this several times but it does not work for me. I regularly wax and I am quite a pro at it now. I have always used Gigi products (wax, wax warmer, muslin strips n spatulas) but this one product is horrible :("
1,Does not work at all,I was very disappointed with this product. It does not remove any wax at all. Any standard body oil works better. I would not recommend this product. Be careful if you want to just try this out. You have to pay for return shipping costs.
3,The surgeon--try another of his works,This novel basically involves a woman doctor trying to find a procedure for dissolving blood clots. The problems she encounters politically in the hospital setting along with the villain pharmaceutical industry are the main thrust of the book. I did not find it very exciting and would recommend others of Roe's books more than this one.
2,A Disappointing Read from an Otherwise Talented Author,"Having read and thoroughly enjoyed ""Look to Winward"" and ""Consider Phlebas,"" I was looking for yet another brilliant ""Culture"" submission from Banks. Several hundred pages into it I realized that this was not a ""Culture"" novel per se (granted, I have only myself to blame for that)... Only when I finished the book did I have to admit that this simply pales in comparison to his other works. The premise and characters were so much more simplistic than what I had come to expect from Banks. The characters plod along between adventures, occasionally dying, without contributing much to a theme or overall mood..."
5,Stunning,"Banks, once again, has written a beautiful, poetic, dark, thrilling adventure story that trancends the genre. The difference between Banks and most SF authors is that Banks can actually write: I found myself rereading a few paragraphs two or three times, the writing is just that good. He's like Ray Bradbury on steroids and acid. Banks can create a stunningly detailed and exotic breathing universe without burning up page after page doing it like lesser writers. Lots of good action, dialogue, gadgets, cultures, personal motivation and interpersonal conflicts, twists...hard to believe all this came out of just one guy's imagination. The only problem with this book is that now I can't read 90% of the SF out there without realizing how pale and shallow it is. If you like SF and good writing, this is the Rosetta Stone people. Order it from AmazonUK."
2,"Good start, depressing end.","First the positive things: If you like sci-fi with a chaotic dark future setting, you'll like this book. And if you're into RPGing, you'll discover typical situations which Sharrow's 'team' encounters in this sci-fi road movie/novel.But in the end, the book left me kinda hollow, if not depressed. Almost all the major characters are dead, quite some questions are left open, and if you pay close attention, there are more than a few events/developments which are at best questionable (i.e. if I didnt miss something, Girmeyn cant be older than 15(!) if he really is what Geis claimed him to be).Of course, Banks had to make his point, how the Lazy Gun and his main character are linked together (I dont wanna tell too much for those ppl who havent read this book yet), but I'm repeating myself - too many deaths dont leave much room to cheer about."
1,just don't get it,"i've red some reviews, including William Gibbons, all favorable, to the point of fake orgasm. after making my way through the first 500 pages (fighting tears of boredom and bouts of deja vu) my only honest assesment is: unless you've red every other sf book and would positively die if you don't read another one, just don't do it!"
1,Befuddling,"Very confusing storylines that never go anywhere and characters that never come to life made this a very difficult read. Mr. Banks never sincerly attempts to clue us in to what drives his characters, the result being that everyone in the story appears to be nothing more than a childish thrillseeker with a deathwish.Lame, shine it on."
4,jacket summary,"from the back cover of the August 1993 Bantam Spectra paperback editioncover art by Paul YoullThey had government permission to hunt down and assassinate her. What the religious Huhsz cult wanted was simple - the most deadly and enigmatic weapon constructed, the Lazy Gun, lost among the planets of the Thrial star system. Whoever controls the Gun controls all the worlds of humankind. And Lady Sharrow, former antiquities thief and soldier, is the key. On the run, betrayed at every turn, Sharrow sets out to accomplish the impossible and exact revenge - even as she delves into the evil at the very heart of humanity."
2,80% Well Written,"Iain can not escape the fact that he writes well. This is a very dark book. Some novel ideas. Then it crashes and burns. End seems to have been tacked on, edited after audience feedback, rushed, oh and did I say completely predictable? If you are a fan of his, you'll probably want to read it. If not a disciple, then pick a different work. Use of Weapons also somewhat predictable, yet compelling never-the-less. I will read more of his, but can not recommend this one."
2,Long. Boring. Dark. Vaguely incestuous.,"Subject line says it all, really.WHAT A TRUDDDDDDGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!Fot the first 90% of the book it's a bit of a pursuit. In the last 10%, after the fjords, well, it's a bit predictable, except that cousin shows up. Then it gets to feeling incestuous.90% boring and predictable. Not redeemed by the rest.My God! I wasted hours of my life on this! Aaaarrrrrggghhhhhh!!!!!!!!11Eleventy!!!!!!!!!!1I really did not enjoy this book."
2,M'eh,"I am a huge Iain M Banks fan. I've read almost all of his Culture books... Look to Windward is my favourite.As for Against a Dark Background, (which is not part of his Culture novels) I would have to rate it as one of Mr. Bank's lesser efforts. The characters aren't particularly sympathetic nor are they engaging. The plot itself is quest after quest after quest. There are some decent scenes and some imaginative locales. However, the whole overall effort just doesn't meet the high standards of his previous works.Go for it, if you are a die hard Banks fan, otherwise I would skip it.Having said that, I have his latest Culture novel, Hydrogen Sonata in my Kindle and I am looking forward to devouring that in short order."
4,One Of The Best From One Of The Best,"Despite the questionable ending, this is one of the best novels from one of sci-fi's best novelists."
5,Does what is says on the cover,"This is truly a story set against a Dark Background - a world where corporations act like nations, where cults dependent upon on material wealth and private armies and where war and profits mix. Bank's does a typically great job of drawing you in with strong anti-heroic characters and wild bursts of invention - the Lazy Guns will have to go down in sci-fi legend as one of the strangest, powerful and disturbing inventive devices around.The only minor criticism you could make is that Sharrow is very similar in her motivations and world-outlook as some Bank's other chief protagonists such as Zakalwe and Horza in other Bank's books (Use of Weapons and Consider Phlebas respectively)/ If you got confused reading this....what can one really say apart from try a bit harder?"
1,contains cancer-causing chemicals,"The Alvin Professional translucent self-healing cutting mat comes with a cautionary label affixed to the shrink wrap that reads: ""This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects, and or other reproductive harm. Wash your hands after use.""This information was not in the Amazon listing or I would not have purchased the product and had to go to the trouble of returning it.California requires companies to notify customers when products contain cancer-causing chemicals. Perhaps the product can be shipped without the label to customers in states that don't require that the public be informed. Perhaps that's why the information isn't mentioned in the Amazon listing. Who knows. Who cares. Oh, I do. That's why I'm writing this review.A Google search on self-healing cutting mats and cancer leaves little to recommend in their stead except good old recyclable cardboard."
2,A thinly veiled advertisement,Don't bother with this one...The writing is poorly organized and extremely repetitive. Remember when you were in high school and were trying to stretch an essay out to a certain number of pages by repeating things?...reminds me of that. Plus much of the text is a thinly veiled advertisement for various guide services and stores. You can do way better by simply Googling for good web pages on the subject.
2,Kayakfishing: The Revolution,"There is some basic useful imformation in this book, but it is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. Often he will circle around with two or three, even four sentences, saying essentially the same content. You would have to believe that no editor was employed in writing this book, because the pros are so bad. If you can wade through the flawed writing that seems like its from gradeschool level, then I guess you can benefit from some of the information. I have no doubt that he is an accomplished kayak fisherman, and I appreciate how he gave credit to others who are also promoting this sport. Just wish he could write as well as he can fish!"
3,Where's the editor when you really need him?,"The information in this book is good. There is no question that subtitling it ""The Revolution"" is accurate and likewise there is no question that anyone wanting to begin fishing from a kayak ought to read and refer back regularly to this book. However . . . and this is a BIG however . . . from a textual standpoint it's a mess. Daubert's wordprocessing program must not have a spellcheck in it because there are a number of repeated howlers. The same information is presented in more than one chapter without referring back to make sure the reader knows that the repetition is deliberate. This is the sort of book that gives self-publishing a bad name because someone really, really needed to look it over before it went to print.Still, if you want to start kayak fishing get it and read it several times . . . probably with your teeth clenched."
5,Great Fishing Tool,I recently read Capt. Kens book and found it to be a great source of info on Kayak fishing. I have never fished out of a yak yet but I know when I do I know I will be prepared with the help of this book. The technical side on how to rig the kayk is the best part.
2,Bar Harbor Newburg sauce,Did not care for the taste of this product. Would not recommend to friends or foes. Perhaps because I make a gourmet version hich exceeds the canned flavor.
1,Ugh!,"This is the most tasteless sauce I have ever tried! The taste, texture and consistency of a paste of flour and water."
2,This is the Study Guide,"The presentation of this book is confusing. The book presented is the study guide to Mankiw's ""Priciple of Economics"" prepared by David Hakes, not a paperback Edition of the Hardcover Testbook. Caveat Emptor!"
3,good song,"My husband and I love the one song from this band unforntunetly it seems to be the one song that stands by itself in all of this bands cd's. I dont get it. The rest of there songs, on other cd's as well has a completly differant sound. But we sure love the I still need you song!!"
1,Horrible! Totally embarassed to present as a gift!!,"I purchased this item as a gift for a baby shower. What an embarassment!!! First of all it wasn't what I expected as being 'chenille'. She washed the blanket and IT LOOKS HORRIBLE!!! The 'chenille' that wasn't really there to begin with is TOTALLY GONE, and when you hold it up you can see bare spots throughout the fabric. I'm not only out on the price but also shipping and will definitely not pay to return the item. She can just use it as a rag, but then it probably won't even hold water!"
2,Christy H.,"I received this blanket as a gift after registering for it. I washed it once (following wash instructions) to prepare for our upcoming new addition and it is already off grain, not perfectly square as it was to begin with. I can see that the chenille is not going to hold up well either."
1,Eh?,"I just finished this book and I'd say only part of it was interesting. It jumped around too much and was hard to follow - plus there wasn't any closure to it. Books need real endings. I wouldn't recommend it, but that's just my opinion."
2,Nothing out of the ordinary,"It is evident that the author has some very worthwhile and interesting thoughts, but she did not adequately expand upon them, and instead created a fairly meaningless, vaguely realistic plot. Read it if you're stuck on a plane from Los Angeles to New York, but it's not worth any more time than that."
4,"Insightful, interesting and subtly quite funny.",Bean's character resembled my inner self. I found myself wanting to not put the book down to find out how she would handle her next emotional dilemma. Towards the end I was cheering her on hoping for her to combat society's enforced rules and influences that so many of us deal with silently. Bean's thoughts are secret thoughts that we want to hide from others. Ms. Goodwin has the insight and courage to bring out those thoughts in her first novel. I am looking forward to her second novel with much anticipation.
1,Don't waste your money!,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read! Karin Goodwin is a Bret Easton Ellis wannabe, yet Bean is even less endearing and likable than all of his characters combined. The writing is shoddy, the plot thin and rambling at best and there is not a single likable person in the entire novel. I want the 2 hours I spent reading this BACK!"
2,Read something else,"The book looks intriguing, but keep going. I couldn't even finish the book. Time is too precious to waste on this title."
1,Don't waste your Time,This was hands-down the worst book I have ever read. The characters transparent and no attempt was made at defining motivations...
3,Vaguely entertaining,"This book was funny at times and I could certainly relate to some of the main character's perspectives. However, I take issue with the depiction of a gay character who ends up married to a straight woman. The author does not adequately explain how this could have happened. The book's ending is also troublesome in this respect, i.e. the relationships of gay characters."
4,Self Review,"Ok, I am the author and I am reviewing my own book. Is that weird or narcissistic or both? Well, I gave myself 4 stars rather than 5, because I was a bit disappointed about how the ""author"" failed to offer a biblical exegesis of the passages quoted in Appendices A and B. Nonetheless, the reader will hopefully find in this work a good, concise summary of the issues at stake during the Semipelagian controversy, coming away with a greater historical appreciation of it. I wrote this book as a way of thinking outloud some lingering questions and nagging doubts. As a result, I have come to appreciate belief in predestination (exemplified by Orange II's moderate Augustinian version of it) and to reject the Semipelagian legacy of my Catholic upbringing and graduate education. Thank God for the monastics I have encountered in my life, who pointed me to the direction of the primacy of divine grace, otherwise I would still be stuck at a superficial ""activism"" and emphasis on human will/works!"
5,A simply outstanding debut by a brilliant historian,"Henry Steele Commager, Arthur Schlesinger, Daniel Boorstin, Edmund Morris - and now Richard Gamble. People who know Richard always knew he was a genius, but now that he has made this steller debut, we now all have the proof that Richard Gamble has just joined the ranks of America's most significant and distinguished historians. I am not exaggerating when I say this! Buy this magnificent tour de force and you will quickly be captivated by the truly outstanding analysis, the genuinely scintillating insights and the sheer breadth of vision that has gone into producing so fabulous a book. Read it and enjoy."
2,"Starts off well, drags on endlessly and then ends with a wimper","I read his other book, LOVE JUNKIE, which I loved and thought was hysterical.So I was glad to come across a copy of MY SEARCH FOR... however, maybe it just shows how much the author has grown from his first book because this one just didn't work for me.Part of the problem is that it is stuffed with colorful characters that really don't advance the plot and all of their asides and sub-plots (and sub-sub plots and adventures) leave you a little confused and bored.The climax is a real disappointment. The ""goal"" of the book is the get the trunk with the letters...but we spend 200 pages getting nowhere near the trunk. Then we do and....well, it just all ends a bit abruptly.I'm going to have to re-read LOVE JUNKIE--maybe it wasn't as funny as I thought it was years ago...."
1,Surpirsed to find so much hate filled language,"I had been looking forward to reading this book for several years. I did laugh once, when the police found a pornographic magazine in the narrator's garbage. Then I was shocked that a character was repeatedly referred to as ""The Faggot"", as if that were his name. There is also an obese main character in the book, Jonica, that although he finds her disgusting, is willing to sleep with her and pretend to love her so he can get close to the secrets of Warren Harding. . . . ooooooh boy. Thirty pages away from the end of the book, and I no longer care about the secrets of Warren Harding. As I begin to read another of Mr. Plunketts unrelated ponderings, I just fall asleep."
2,Poor Reproduction of a Great Film,"This review is for the MK2/Warner release, ""The Circus (Two Disc Special Edition)""Trying to watch this DVD was very frustrating and ultimately disappointing. I spent the entire viewing time trying to find some way to adjust the screen. The image has way, way, way too much contrast, and the details are often completely lost in the dark areas. The night scene toward the end of the movie was particularly difficult to watch, as the characters' face and hands were sometimes the only parts visible. The picture is also very soft focus or out of focus, especially disturbing for viewing faces. When a character turns his head, there is digital smearing upon the movement. It is also cropped a little too close on the top and bottom of the frame. We are lucky that the contract between the Chaplin family and MK2 has expired. I suggest waiting to buy this until a better print shows up. Certainly you should not pay any premium price for this; it really is not worth it."
3,silent movie buff,I liked the movie but was'nt as good as some others chaplin had done but still a decent movie.
3,The Circus,"The Circus is like many of Chaplin's comedies they start off hilarious but once they get towards the middle they get boring. He just does the same thing over and over again. I suggest you dont buy a Chaplin movie, just wait until his movies are on a classic film channel, like TCM."
3,Problematic Chaplin,"""The Circus"" (1928) is a decidedly strange effort from Charlie Chaplin. His last silent film focuses on the aspect of a clown's success and failure - a theme that worked to better advantage in ""Limelight"" (1952). There are several highlights, particularly the classic funhouse chase, yet the overall movie seems forced and a bit too melodramatic. No wonder Chaplin kept ""The Circus"" out of circulation for more than 40 years - he knew it was lacking. However, the DVD ""special edition"" includes some terrific extras, such as a deleted sequence originally shown in Kevin Brownlow and David Gill's ""Unknown Chaplin"" documentary."
3,One of Chaplin's last silents.,"Well, THE CIRCUS lacks the inventive hilarity of THE GOLD RUSH and the poignant finale of CITY LIGHTS, but it has so many moments of captivating lunacy, with everything from inspired originals that has been copied by everyone including THE THREE STOOGES."
3,Not for video iPod,This will not work with video iPod. The video iPod does not have the power source next to the audio out like all the other iPods. The video iPod only has the audio out (headphone jack).
2,"nice looking, but disappointed","ordered size XXL for my brother for christmas, he said it fit great overall but it was too short! he's 6'5"" and ussually an XXL sweatshirt fits just fine all over, including length. He loved the sweatshirt, so was disappointed that he had to return it!"
4,Excellent Presentation,This book is a great presentation on almost all the Tropheus available from the Tanganikan Lake. Free Poster!
1,Missed the target,"This book did not have the basics for data warehousing. The conecpts were not clear, transition was very poor. Overall, I got nothing from that book."
2,Dmitri Tiomkin gave us a haunting melody.,"The memorable theme song earned an OSCAR some 50 years' ago! But the movie itself deserves to rest in peace.When the crew said they might fly as high as 9,000 feet (!) I knew that this historical restoration would be mostly sound and little substance, as proved in world premiere 7.17.05 on AMC.Thanks for the memory."
1,Watch this dud BEFORE you waste your money on it !!!!!,"AMC will be broadcasting THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY just at the same time it hits DVD.No one has been able to see this film for years, as the Wayne family surpressed it.Now, it is surfacing, and since no one has seen it in 25 years, they probably think it's a great, if not good film.THINK AGAIN!It's AWFUL!But don't let me be the judge, watch it on cable before you plunk down your hard-earned money and decide if you really want to own this piece of garbage."
5,My favorite movie of all time!,"I first saw The High and the Mighty in 1953 when I was only 12 years old. I decided then that I wanted to be an ""airline stewardess"". I never did achieve that goal. I have desparately tried to find the movie for years. It left such a wonderful memory and THAT MUSIC! I would also love to have the soundtrack from the movie. In the late 50's, I lived in Carmel and went to high school with two of Ernest K. Gann's kids. Had I only known then, I probably could have gotten a copy of the movie, very easily. I didn't know at the time that movie would always haunt me. I join all of you in waiting until the estate of John Wayne allows it to be released. Why they are focusing on witholding that particular movie of Mr. Wayne's, I find very interesting. PLEASE, PLEASE, ALLOW THE RELEASE! Does anyone out there know how we, as a group, could write and plead with the family!"
5,John Wayne's Epitaph,"I first saw this movie as a boy, and was captivated by the opening dialog, in which Wayne's character was described as ""The only man I ever knew who was brave enough not to commit suicide!""I have never understood why it was not released on video. (I last saw it in 1973 on local TV in Chicago.)When The Duke died, I accurately predicted that the networks would select the closing scenes of The High and The Mighty as his epitaph--not She Wore A Yellow Ribbon, not Fort Appache, not Stagecoach, not even True Grit. And I was right--he went out with a loving ""So long, you ancient pelican.""The grand daddy of the disaster flicks, it is probably hackneyed today (the airplane has propellers for goodness sakes), but the story is first rate and Wayne is marvelous.Don't miss it if you ever get the chance to see it--you will never forget it."
5,Predecessor of the 'Airport' movies,"The High and the Mighty was ahead of its time in 1954. John Wayne was well cast as 'an ancient pelican' whose leadership is tested in making the right decisions to land a troubled aircraft safely. Diminti Tionkin's haunting theme masterfully scores the drama. This is my all-time favorite movie, I can't watch it enough!"
3,The birth of a cliche,"Every cliche starts life as a novel, captivating thought, remarkable in its time as pithy and pertinent. This innovative idea goes blithely out to world to attract notice and admiration. But as familiarity breeds comtempt, the exceptional idea repeated too often becomes dry and hackneyed, and few of us remember its youth and winsome freshness. Thus with The High and the Mighty. Whereas my husband remembered it as a riveting thriller, as he watches it now, he comments only on the stereotyped characters and the predictable course of the plot. Newly-weds incredible in their naivete, spoiled actors secure in their egos, aging glamour girls unaware of the value of their hard-won experience inhabit this film. Wayne's understated hero alone looks as good as the day he was captured on film.See it, but don't project your nostalgia for Hollywood drama. Just remember how many movies since then have tried to duplicate it, and enjoy the original with a little charity."
5,The High and the Mighty (2 Disc Collector's Edition,I saw this movie when it first came out and have always wanted to see it again. This edition is excellent and I love the music. It is not like the movies of today that leave nothing to the imagination and sometimes show you too much. Give me the old movies that DID leave it to your own imagination. Certainly can recommend this movie.
3,High & Mighty,"Slow moving in the beginning. I am an avid Duke fan, but I had to force myself to sit for nearly an hour till the movie picked up"
1,Horrid Hollywood Hokum,"And you thought ""Airplane!"" was hilarious...""The High and the Mighty"" is just as funny. Unfortunately, the laughs are wholly unintentional. When Leonard Maltin prompts the audience (in his introduction) to watch the film with its historic and cultural context in mind, you know you're in for a stinker. (And it's a long stinker at that.) The screenplay piles on so many remarkably misguided cliches (which must have been hoary even then) you begin to think that somebody somewhere (probably Wellman) must have had his tongue planted firmly in his cheek. And for a suspense film, it's remarkably boring. What Wayne is doing in this nothing part is beyond me. Almost as mysterious is how Jan Sterling and Claire Trevor ended up with Academy Award nominations. Come on, folks, they were making great films in the 50s -- this just isn't one of them."
1,A disaster of a movie,"This is a disaster movie. The production was a disaster. The script was a disaster. The jealous husband tries to shoot somebody to his right. How does the bullet end up taking out the motor on the end of the left wing? Did it circumnavigate the earth that fast? Then the shooter sits back down as if nothing happened. No restraints, no reaction from the crew. Then he walks free at the end of the movie, right past the police. Sorry folks, assault with a deadly weapon was a violent crime even in the 1950s. Wayne plays a character who began flying in World War One, but he looks remarkably well preserved for a character who must be pushing 60. Not one gray hair? And after losing his wife and son in another plane crash? The only good line was the very last one. The rest was stilted and trite, stock characters mumbling stereotypical lines. Stick with Airplane if you want an entertaining airplane disaster movie."
1,Stinker provided raw material for the Airplane movie,So bad I couldn't get through the first half hour. A true stinker of a movie. Nothing but pathetically written dialogue filled with cliches. Wooden acting is a compliment. John Wayne at his usual worst. Save your money. There are much better films made during the same time that won't make you gag.
5,They have to get this movie out again,"I have been thinking about this movie for years and have been trying to find it for as long. Aviation has been my life for the last 25 years. If you love Planes and you haven't seen this, you have too!!! I haven't seen it in at least 30 years. Come on get it out!! PLEASE!"
2,The High and The Mighty...Not so much.,"The High and the Mighty circa 1954, a classic...great film-score - academy award 1955 - and The Duke, at his coolest. other than that, not much here. 2Stars. bookend watching this dinosaur with Airplane. a can't miss twin billing...Bob Stack in both."
3,Old-fashioned Hollywood film set the template for disaster film genre,"The ""High and the Mighty"" is one of those old-fashioned Hollywood films that you will either love or hate. One of the original disaster movies focussing on a diverse range of characters unexpectedly facing probable death (in this case on a crippled aircraft). The performances are excellent although it's hard to fathom why Claire Trevor was nominated for an Oscar - she's OK but nothing special.The film features a fine, romantic score by Dmitri Tiomkin and looks great in it restored, widescreen format."
2,Crashing Bore,"Incredibly dated and corny--and even back in the day, some of this stuff must have been a laff riot. Wayne is what, maybe 10 years older than the other pilots, and they're making cracks about him flying with the Wright Bros.? The airport check-in scene at the beginning is strictly from Love Boat and the sequence where the passengers toss their luggage out of the plane is funnier than anything in Airplane! (Claire Trevor: ""What a great way to get a new wardrobe!"") Geronimo!"
3,You don't have to be a John Wayne fan to like this movie.,"The High and Mighty is a very good character study of a group of people flying from Hawaii to San Francisco. Each one has their own story to tell many of which are quite intriguing. There is a mechanical failure shortly after half way through the flight and all the passengers and crew cope in their own style. John Wayne plays an ""old timer"" pilot who lost his family in an accident of a plane he was flying. While he gets top billing it is not the typical star roll as he is just a person on board the flight with so many other stories. Wayne does come to the rescue but in a rather subdued fashion for him. The movie is a little dated due to the advancment of technology and the obvious rank of the ""stewardess"" within the airline but in all it is easy to forget those things and engrossed in the film."
5,"Welcome back, you old pelican!","Anyone under 40 just won't get it. For the rest of us it's a terrific piece of 50's nostalgia. Oh, those good ol' days when people got ""dressed"" to travel, airplanes were half full at best and, you could even bring your pistol on board. Not a bad bit of acting by The Duke either. And where the Hell is the kid that sleeps for 14 hours when I fly?"
5,Release of the DVD,"I originally saw this movie when I was 14 and it had a big effect on me, both the story and the music. When I checked last year for the release (2004) of the DVD, I read that May of 2005 was the date. Is this still true? It seems with May only two weeks away, there is no prepublicity yet. I have an old VHS tape that is poor quality, yet I watch it when I yearn for that look into the past of a classic John Wayne movie, a movie where he is at his best. Looking forward to the DVD.SL"
2,THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY,"the package arrived on time, in good condition.i have not been able to view this movie because it would not work on my television because it had american region zone number.because i live in perth western australia, i would have thought the region would have been set as a general zone."
5,The High & the Mighty with John Wayne,I personally liked this movie. I've seen reviews that show it as a comedy but I saw nothing funny about it. I thought it was a very serious good movie. Well written & a very good plot. Being a John Wayne fan I thought that he did very well in bringing this movie across. I only keep good movies for my DVD closet collection & you can believe this one is on the shelf in the John Wayne row
5,One of John Wayne's Best,"Only John Wayne can make a movie like this work so wonderfully, especially with all the co stars. I only wish he could make other movies for us."
3,The High and the Mighty,"I watched this movie because I saw it when I was about 8 years old and loved it. However, movies made it the 50's and movies today are so different. I still liked the story and the movie was good, I just had a hard time getting past the background ta da's when there was any drama. I probably wouldn't watch it again but I did enjoy seeing it this time."
4,CHIC's last enterprise,"Of course it's not the last CHIC record. But probably it is the last attempt by the 2 (Bernard and Nile) to create something credible (¿Believer?) before going into memory-space as musicians (we know that Nile had some incredible successes as a producer afterwards).So, on Believer, we have the delight to listen to some outstanding work: Believer, You Are Beautiful, You Got Some Love, and last, but not least, Party Everybody (the latter being the blueprint for oo so many rapping outlets).In comparison to Take It Off, Believer sounds dated (the claps are so 80's!), and a tad bit sleepy.Still, it's the sound of those times, and can create a reasonably danceable ambience.Only for the ""Believers""."
4,Surprising Sound!,"The Creative Labs TravelSound MP3 has surprisingly good sound for such a little unit. It's a ""palm-sized)"" one-piece stereo speaker system, little larger than an eyeglass case (WxHxD 6"" x 2"" x 2.5"") but the sound is nearly as good as a small boombox. This unit does a great job in smaller rooms but you'll be disappointed if you try to fill a large room with sound. You do lose most of the low end so the bass is a little anemic. But the mid-range and the high end are crisp and clean.You can hook up your portable electronic audio equipment like your CD/MP3 player, portable DVD player, even your laptop computer but being able to download MP3/WMA files directly to the unit is a definite PLUS.It is a little $$$ but it is still a good value. I recommend it to anyone who travels a lot but likes to have decent tunes in their hotel room."
4,Great Deal!!!,"Length:: 2:22 MinsThese speakers are the best value for the money, I mean 11 dollars for sound quality that rivals much larger speakers is a steal. These speakers have great sound quality (loaded with bass, treble and highs) they almost sound as if they have a sub woofer built in (you can hear deep bass even with rap). The speakers also get loud enough to entertain a small group of people and they have a surround sound button that you can activate to create virtual surround sound.Pros: Cost, quality, sound,Cons: weight, size, 32mb memory, smart card only expansion slot and batteries were not included.For more of these speakers and other portable devices, visit my youtube page at http://www.youtube.com/sirmasterpimp"
2,Not what I thought I was getting,"I got this particular unit because of the embedded recorder and media reader. I have a voice recorder that I'm not crazy about because I dont love its proprietary file transfer software. With the TravelSound I thought, hey cool, I can stick in a memory card and have as much recording capacity as I want.Not true -- you can't record to the card. Only to the 32meg of memory. So now instead of being able to pop the card and take my notes with me to some device that can generically read them, I have yet another device that I have to cable directly to my PC. I'd much rather leave the unit itself in my laptop bag and just stick the card in my pocket. The unit may be fairly small (though well over double the size of an ipod), but once you factor in the cables and such it's just a big inconvenience.My sounds are apparently not going to be travelling with me the way I thought they would."
1,Last copyright 2003? No Windows 7 driver? You must be kidding,"I decided to go with a dual monitor system and selected this Video card. Resolution was poor and couldn't ajust for my high resolution monitor. I was suprised to find no Windows 7 drivers. Upon inspection of the box in VERY fine print showed the last copyright date 2003, almost 10 years ago! Needless to say I returned the product."
4,Review,"Based on the journal kept by Christopher Columbus, tells the story of how Columbus and the crew of the Santa Maria celebrated Christmas in 1492."
2,Porky Pig vs. Daffy Duck,"I've watched Porky against Daffy in ""Baby Bottlneck"" (with a guest appearance by Tweety) and ""My Favorite Duck""."
5,It was a great work of art!,"Poop,Paw and Hoof - Outdoor adventure for Kids was exciting every single minute. It was like you turn on your VCR and insert the tape and all of a sudden............ OIP, this is one helluva movie. So if I was you and you wish I was, I'd spend the money to purchase this movie!"
2,"The Collece Short Stories of Louis L'Amour, Volu 7","I ordered this as a used copy. In the mail i received the short stories VOLUME 4. If you take time to read the reviews you will see most are writing about VOLUME 4. Be certain you ask the seller if you will be receiving VOLUME 7 if you should order second hand. i was upset that I received the wrong volume and was told that I could return it. I was more upset that no one took any notice when I told them, Amazon and the seller, that the 4th Volume was being sold under the used heading of the volume I actually wanted---VOLUME 7!!I see that the problem has not been altered since I wrote my letters to them both. My advice: contact the seller to be certain you will be receiving what you order."
1,disappointed,"this is not one of his western type books ,, i don't know what you would call it. so if you are expecting a western you'll be disappointed. though a couple of the books in here are ok he should have stuck with westerns. if you can preview this book before buying."
3,good service,The problem with requesting this review is the time lapse between ordering/receiving the item and your request for a review. At the time I ordered this book I ordered several from various other places so was receiving several books during the same period. I didn't realize Amazon required a review on their deliveries or I would have submitted one as soon as the book was received. At this late date I can't give other than a three-star since I don't remember how quickly I received the book. Sorry.
3,"short stories l'amour, vol 4",not as good as the vol 1 thru 3like western short stories better than seamen stories
5,"Great Product, Works Perfectly","My dog had a few staples after a minor surgery to remove a benign lesion. Rather than pay for a $40 follow-up office visit to have the staples removed, I purchased this product and it worked perfectly. The surgical staples popped right out with no problem or pain to my dog. I have it in my first aid kit in case I ever need to use it again."
2,Not well written but an interesting subject.,"The material in this book is generally interesting - to sum it up, the government in Vichy France during the Holocaust were as bad or worse than the Nazis and created their own anti-Jewish laws, sending many French Jews to their death.Unfortunately, despite the interesting topic, the writing and organization are so poor I wonder how it was published. At points, the writing is so incomprehensible that I cannot follow the author's train of thought. Of course, there are not a lot of books on Vichy France during the Holocaust, so you may be stuck with this one regardless."
3,"Could've been better,","I didn't have any expectations regarding this film. Plot is basically about a group of kids with bad attitudes who encounter an old creepy guy in the woods. There's plenty to work with but I think this movie fell short because of what didn't happen plot-wise. I still managed to enjoy it though,"
5,This is a must-read for understanding your relationships,"Fishing by Moonlight is a delightfully evocative title to a book about understanding and potentially fixing relationships in your life. Since we are social animals this is profoundly important. Dr. Sawyer writes clearly and convincingly about how to get to know yourself and improve your life. Her book comes with many recommendations from highly regarded, even well-known, experts. I am not one of those readers. Instead I literally `wrote a book' about what not to do in a relationship. After reading `Fishing by Moonlight' I have a much better understanding of my past romantic misadventures. I wish I'd discovered the book earlier in my life! I hope you'll discover it now."
1,"Aretha CD with Patti's Labelle Picture on the Cover, How Dare y ou",I refuse to own this CD. To think who ever compiled this complication of songs by Aretha and put Patti Labelle on the cover needs to get out of the business. Find something else to do either sell underwears or new paper. How could a big mistake of this kind happen anyway. Some one is not on the job.
4,"Not for the seasoned (non-technical) eBayer, but not bad","As a seasoned eBayer that is not interested in setting up eBay search robots or other similar hacks, I found most of the advanced tips offered in this book a bit useless. Yet, having experienced a lot of things as a buyer or as a seller, I can see this book being a very useful guide for people who are new to eBay to avoid pitfalls that are quite common and become a more knowledgeable eBayer with time. Overall, quite good, but more geared toward the beginner to intermediate eBayer audience. If you have bought or sold more than 20-30 items using eBay, who knows: you might find it useful. I know I didn't, for myself."
2,More of a sermon than a comedy,"I have watched several of Chonda's comedy concerts, and this one disappointed me. It was one of the earlier shows, and Chonda improved her program so much in ensuing years that I recommend skipping this one entirely."
5,High quality litter pan liner!,"This is one of the highest quality litter box liner's that I've been able to find.It's very easy to bundle up the cat droppings, tie them up in #7 where they belong and carry them out to the trash.Good stuff! :)"
1,$70 bucks??!,People should be selling Vick jerseys for next to nothing now... they should PAY people to take them off their hands... not charge for them! Slash the price more than half and I'll consider buy one or two... so I can burn them!!!
4,A child's displacement opens a window into ethnic diversity in Iran,"The story of a little boy from southern Iran whose parents are killed in the Iran-Iraq war, and who eventually ends up in the north where people are ethnically and linguistically different from the area he comes from. The film deals with the ethnic differences inside Iran, racism, and prejudice, as the woman who takes the boy in confronts the hostility of her husband and other villagers. It has the universal theme of how we confront those who are different from us, but in a totally unfamiliar setting which is fascinating in itself. Iran is a multicultural nation with a variety of geographies, languages, and cultures little known to the outside world, and this movie provides a touching glimpse inside as well as sharp social criticism by the director."
3,pretty old news,"the book is quite old, so if you have a problem with your foot and you went to a podiatrist, you probably already know everything.however, for a ""complete beginner"" in feet problems it has some useful information."
2,BRILLIANT LOW BUDGET SATIRE,"In this sequel, we find our heroes--an all-girl band called The Love Dolls--reforming and becoming even more popular than ""Brews"" Springsteen, an accomplishment managed by having Springsteen killed by a member of Redd Kross disguised as Gene Simmons of Kiss. And if that doesn't give you the idea that this movie doesn't take itself too seriously, imagine Jello Biafra of The Dead Kennedys playing the president of the United States. Or Annette Zilinskas of Blood On The Saddle playing a biker chick (who also contributes a great cover version of Sonny & Cher's ""Baby Don't Go""). Or Vicki Peterson of The Bangles leading a hippie commune in a sing-a-long of ""Give Peace A Chance.""Don't expect great production standards but, if you're looking for a hilarious attack on the pompous side of rock'n'roll, look no further. ""Love Dolls Superstar"" delivers that in spades!"
4,Great Job!,"This was a very interesting story to read. The author actually places you right in the middle of the action. I felt like I could ""see"" everything she was writing about. I really enjoyed taking that journey with the author and I look forward to her next work!"
2,Poorly written and confusing,This was crap. It just didn't unravel right. One minute Diamond was a straight A student then the next a street gangster. I couldn't relate to her character at all or to the book for that matter. Don't waste your money.
4,"Colle Bookclub( New Paltz,NY)",From a Hard rock to a Gem is an interesting read. Many of the reviews are calling it crap because they have not stuck it out. In the first couple of chapters its obvious that Pamela is just starting out as she needed time to get comfortable with street dialougue but your a true fan of urban fiction you will enjoy the read. The book is worth the money just keep reading. This is the beginning of the trilogy the next 2 books get much better with interesting twist.
4,Hmmmmm.....the sixties style homage to a sea shanty....,"I really like Dreaming of You. I think it's even better than last year's Legal Man by Belle and Sebastian for bringing up that feel-good mod mood. Give the kids a break and they'll go far, just wait and see. They just have to get over this sea-shanty phase and they're golden."
2,Book Written in a Very Old Fashioned Style,"This book is written in a very old fashioned style -- it was originally published in 1957. A little too wordy and not enough pictures to help understand the material. There are many other books, such as Munkres, that are a whole lot better."
4,"Good for the money, but not perfect.","The chains are supposed to be galvanized, but they appear to be just nickel-coated and rusted after a couple weeks outside. I'm not sure if it's the number of chains or the weight or what, but I also get a whole lot more bounce-outs than I do with a DGA basket.All that said and I own 3 of these and will probably buy more as I expand my course. They break down easily and are pretty stable. I will probably replace the chains eventually with heavier, rust-proof ones. In the end I'll still save hundreds of dollars building a 9-hole course by going with this instead of a DGA, Innova or Discraft target."
4,Definately worth the money,"This goal is worth the money all day long. It is well constructed, easy set up, easy tear down, and is easy to take along. Would also work well as a stationary goal. The discs you might as well throw in the garbage, they are crap, but thats not why you are buying this. I am planning on buying at least 3 moew over the next year to help build my own course i have been working on....i have the land now all i need are the baskets."
4,Great Practice Basket!,"My wife bought this basket for me for my birthday this year. I have used it a few times for quick short games with family and friends, and some short game practice in the back yard.This hole seems very druable, easy to set up, and very portable. I don't think you can get a better deal for the price. Some reviews have said that the light weight chains are prone to blow through shots, but we havn't seemed to have that problem with this basket. Great buy."
5,GREAT,This item is GREAT! It only was shipped in the selling box rather than a shipping box and that kind a sucked.
3,didn't line up,I have ordered this prouct before - this time the holes to fit it together did not line up - the company has sent me two different items hoping to fix this problem.
4,needs more chains,"the disc catcher is awesome, the only thing is it needs added chains to it cause the disc will blow through it, but it works perfectly fine for back yard putting and the assembly was so easy i think my 7 year old kid could of put it together by himself!!!"
4,Great goal for home use,The instep disc golf goal is a great goal for home use. It stands sturdy without wobbling and is made with good materials. The quick connect pins make it easy to assemble and disassemble. An inner set of chains would help keep a few more shots in the basket (maybe 2 in 10 slip through). Also the top post section could be improved by adding a pin to secure it to the lower post instead of just fitting over it.Overall this is a great basket and I plan on purchasing another one soon.
3,Fun gift,"This product was a gift to my husband from his daughters. He loves the fact that they can go out back and play around. It is heavy, so not really something you want to move around a lot. The chains do seem a bit far apart compared to regular courses, but that does not seem to be an issue for the players at our house. We wish we had more of these to set up a course, but for now it does the job. Hoping it does not rust as said."
4,great for the price,This is a great product for the price. We added a few extra chains for a little more weight but it is a good quality product for someone looking to practice at home. Not very portable but good for home practice.
3,Valiant Effort.. but...,"This product has two settings, junior, and senior. The Junior setting has the basket about 5 inches closer to the ground, and leaves a larger target area between the top edge of the basket and the bottom of the upper rim (where the chains attach). The senior setting is higher off the ground and leaves a smaller target area. While this might seem like a nice feature I have to mention that neither of these settings falls within the PDGA specifications for targets. On top of this, when its on the senior setting the chains are too long, and from the look of them there is no convenient way to adjust this without buying some extra hardware.In an effort to make this product more versatile than it really needed to be they reduced its overall value to anyone who's interested in accuracy and precision (2 things of great importance in disc golf)."
1,"Sadly, my star is broken","I received these earrings as a gift, and I was really excited because I love stars, and these small earrings are adorable. I don't have long hair so I never had a problem with the earrings popping off as other reviewers experienced, but I did find that they sat kind of oddly on my earlobes. It could just be the placement of my piercings, but I would just turn them upside down and found that they looked better that way. Sadly, after just a few wears, the stud broke off of my earring as well.I gave them one star because that's all I have left. :("
2,Tiny product with BIG shipping Cost,"This was the perfect size for my 12 y.o. grand-daughter's newly pierced ears. You would have to use the Hubble telescope to see them on an adult. Shipping costs would normally prohibit their purchase (as it as much as the earrings) but it was a 'crunch time' gift. I don't know if they fell apart as she lost one the next day. Oh, well...."
5,I am amazed...,"I purchased these because I was looking for something different to the normal silver stud. I was afraid they were going to be to small, but they are just the right size. I haven't had any problems with my long hair and the earrings coming loose, as the previous reviewer experienced. I just know that I will be ordering from Sabrina Silver again in the near future. Thanks!"
3,Tiny Sterling Silver Star Stud Earrings,These earrings are very nice. The photo of them does not show exactly how small they are. They are actually smaller. I would like to have had some kind of description or measurement to show the actual size.
3,Not so much,"Very inexpensive. They were cute when they arrived, however after wearing them once, the post broke. I had to email for a return request and then wait for a reply. I was told I could send them back and receive a new pair this one time only. So we're talking almost four weeks for a $10 pair of earrings?"
4,Good Music,"I've been a fan of the strokes for a while now. I even saw them in a festival in stuttgart, Germany. Hammond is a great guitarrist, especially live, where he sound's just like in the studio. I did'nt knew what to expect of his solo effort without his bandmates, and without his partner in crime from the strokes in the guitar Valensi, but his guitar work is mellow and flawless in this album. Hope to see him live, come to puerto rico, lots of fans here. Peace"
3,Mediocre but still better than most of the new stuff going on.,"This album is good but it's unfortunate that it comes from a Stroke in the sense that there have been many a band that do this sort of thing way better and the best of the lot (The Realistics, Supergrass, etc.) have sadly slipped under the radar. This album does have a number of ""cringe"" moments like the ""Sugar Ray"" part at the end of ""Bright Young Thing"" but they get evened out with a couple of solid numbers. Not bad for Mr. Fro. and his crew of socialites."
4,Sneaky Little Ole Albert. Who Knew?,"I have got to seriously hand it to Albert on this one. I went into this with luke warm expectations of a strokes retread album. Instead I was left with a sense of optimism and genuine elation from this album. These are fantastically crafted songs. Catchy, well written, harmonious, and emotional. This albums does sound like the strokes a bit however. The trademark itchy guitar prevails but works nicely with Alberts monotone but surprisingly refined voice. There are several tracks that are fantastic on this one. This album seems best suited for listening to straight through while drinking a Papst Blue Ribbon and smoking a spliff with good friends on a breezy summer day. I'm sure that is what Albert and guest stars Julian Casablanca and Sean Lennon were doing while recording this splendid piece of work that will most likely be overlooked this year but will be revisited in the future by future hipsters."
5,Quick resource,"This is a very good book for those that have limited time to master APA style. However, it still managed to be very comprehensive. A very good resource to have with you in graduate school."
5,A Pocket Style Manual for a Pocket Style Price,"I received my order only 5 days after I purchased it, which was quicker than expected. I also received emails letting me know that my purchase was made and when my order was shipped. It came in the best quality, wrapped and in perfect condition. I wouldn't have chosen anyone else to buy from."
4,Helpful,"Needed it for college. Helpful, but most times you can look some of it up online. Cute book though."
5,Pocket style manual by Hacker.,"The book was delivered in time and in great shape. The content of the book is good and I would recommend it for graduate students who intend to write a thesis. It has quick references of Chicago Manual of styles,APA and MLA plus practical examples."
4,Full of helpful information,"I am a college student and find this manual incredibly helpful. I found some of the descriptions in the grammar sections to be a little confusing with the way they were explained, but usually the examples helped to make things clearer. The section on the paper formatting is incredibly helpful, especially when it comes to explaining the different ways to cite sources in the works cited section of a paper. I will hold onto this book and use it to help me write papers for the rest of my college career."
1,not what i expected,i purchased this last semester for school and it did not specify which edition it was. it is so old that it doesn't even have internet sources in it. it was no use to me.
4,Pocket Style Manual,"The book was in great condition, it did take around 10 days to come, and I was hoping for it to come more quickly."
5,A pocket style manual,its an excently book to have handy. its very helpful for every class thats consists of writting.
5,Pockter book,Good book for reference need for school. there is no dislike for the book yes i would recommend this book for anyone who in school
2,Good,"Didn`t end up using it because I didn`t need it. I skimmed through some pages,good book for English majors. Cool"
5,Excellent,"The product came when I expected and it was exactly what I wanted. No flaws with the product, but excellent on all ends."
5,Great Vendor,. This guide is extremely helpful in being able to sucessfully write a college level mla format paper. It has been 9 years since i have written an essay and this guide really came in handy.
4,I was looking for a very specific database,"If you are looking for general business listings (non geography or industry specific) then this CD-ROM is great. I was looking for a very specific database, and in hindsight, I would have been better off buying from their custom data service. I did find a nice amount of listings for what I was looking for, but I have since spoken to their customer service department who confirmed I would have gotten more records matching my needs had I spent my money on a custom list."
3,Those nature sounds have to go,"The nature sounds added to DeBussy's works are a horrible mistake. But if you like hearing unnatural splashing during Clair de lune, then by all means go for it. If you want my advice, get his piano works without the fakey additions."
4,Rainy Day Fun,"This is one of those movies I put on during the rainy days. I just sit back and enjoy the simple and fun 15 chapters.It is a rare serial to find so if you collect I suggest you grab this one now. The transfer is not the best and I would say that no restoration was even attempted.But do not let that deter you from checking this out.All of the leads are good and take thier roles seriously. Ray Crash Corrigan steals the serial as the ape. It is obvious that he was having a ball and adding little bits in every scene the ape is in.The movie has all the trappings typical of serials. Hidden panels,captured heroines,special needed ingredients,villans in disguise and square jawed hero who seems to get beat up every chapter.What more could you ask for? Great rainy day fun!"
3,Uhm...the Ape doesn't fight crime.,"This is a fun serial. Not a great one like ""Daredevils of the Red Circle"" or ""Spy Smasher"" (or many others), but a fun one--and kinda goofy. While I haven't seen this particular release yet, I'm hoping it really is a new transfer of the film--'cause I'll definitely buy it if it is. BUT! If it's just a burned copy of one of the fan-quality copy-of-a-copy-of-a-copy videos floating around the 'trading' network, then it's way, way, waaaaay over priced and you'd be better off buying one of the bootlegs offered on that auction site. And the cover blurb is willfully mis-leading: The ape is NOT the robot's companion and it does NOT fight crime."
4,Fun Chair for kids,"My son (8 yrs) received this chair and the matching inflatable bed as a gift. He loves the chair and his older sister loves it too. I have to find one for her now. He sits on it, beats it up, walks around wearing it, etc. It is quite durable. I add air periodically to keep it fun. He is trying out the inflatable bed today. I laid on it and it was comfy. The set came from Target for $25 including a foot pump."
4,This book will inspire you!,"This book is a quick and exciting read, and I got more and more inspired as I went along. It outlines practical steps to help young actors, at any level of experience, transform their thoughts, dreams, concerns and ideas into exciting theater. It does assume some knowledge of stagecraft, warm-up and improvisational exercises, but there are other books for that. This book focuses on creating original works through a group process, which should be part of every high-school curriculum!And although it's aimed at educators working with teens, the techniques described would be useful for groups with any range of ages, from pre-teens to seniors. Get this book, it will give you great ideas!"
1,Worthless,Save your time and money and do not buy this it doesn work at all I used it for about a month and its probly just a placebo I just lost weight the old fashion way diet and exercise if your look for a boost or some type of short cut do not go with this product
1,Did not work,"This product did not work for me at all. I was just as hungry as I normally was, and did not loose a pound... Not only did I not loose any weight, I gained two pounds while I was on it. I'm not saying it doesnt work for ANYONE, but it definitely didnt work for me."
4,"So Far, this is a good scanner","I'm having a few problems scanning ""xeroxed"" pages (paper not feeding properly), but most of the time, the feeder works great. Paperport is great. Also the abbyy OCR that comes with the scanner is better than the OCRs from most of the big name companies. I would buy this scanner again (I've had 3 previously). With age, I'm hoping the sheet feed hangup will go away. It may also be the humidity."
5,Finally Be Your Fabulous SELF at Fifty or Older!,"This is a terrific guide written by a ""Power-Granny"" (--my term for and outrageous older woman of any age--)!Ruth Harriet Jacobs has faced the boogeymen of age with courage and humor, and she generously shares her wisdom in this book.It's a guide that covers everything from turning your ""rage"" (at becoming invisible as you age, etc.), into your own brand ofout-rage-eousness.If you're feeling depressed about any aspect of growing older, this book will help lift your spirits and give you new ideas on ways to get the most out of this stage of life.Reviewer: Linda Painchaud"
1,commit felonies?,I opened this book to a section in which the author recommended that readers commit felonies. I hope she is ready to pay for their attorneys. I do not recommend this book for anyone.
1,be an outrageous older woman is the worst book I ever wasted money on!,With a title like that I was sure it would be a winner...but just the opposite.Nothing new that any older woman doesn't already know or hasn't already done...Read it through in a very short time and threw it in the trash...waste of money...!
5,Interesting Techniques for Conservation Professionals,"As a conservation finance professional, I navigate and package financing options for land and water protection interests on a daily basis.This book has stretched my thinking and added many techniques to the list of possibilities - it also focuses on the private market - the business - of land conservation.Population growth and development further drive efforts to hold on to our natural and cultural identity. This book goes a long way in strengthening those efforts.In addition, the editor blends history and financing techniques in an interesting and insightful manner."
4,Insight into DR baseball,Very interesting. I had interviewed Sano a couple of years ago when he first signed with the Twins. I write a sports column for two Florida newspapers. Book gave a great insight into the DR baseball world.
4,"Great product, bought a set plus this one but one was defective","I had no issues replacing the defective one, except the hassle of having to replace it. Kids loved the installation in our RV. And we loved or having to listen to the movies they were watching!"
1,Beyond bad,"Not really very funny, and I love Troma stuff like Mother's Day, Toxic Avenger etc. This one just misses the mark in virtually every scene with corny humor."
4,THE FUNNIEST MOVIE EVER BY TROMA FILM CO. FROM NEW JERESY.,ORIGINALLY FILMED FOR JAPENESE RELEASE BUT IT FLOPED 10 TIMES OVER.THEN IT WAS RE-RELEASED IN THE U.S. ALL THE DIOLOG REDUBBED WITH NEW PAINFULLY FUNNY SCRIPT.THIS IS A MUST FOR ANY ONE WHO LOVES TO HURT THEIR SIDES LAUGHING.
3,Travels in Maine,"This book contains roughly two dozen articles the author wrote for the DownEast Magazine. Half of these articles deal with typical Maine things to do, the other half deal with places in Maine to go (although this differentation gets mixed a lot). In particular the articles about places sometimes are nicely written and interesting, some other essays are rather not that thrilling.The book was edited in 2002, some articles were written in the early 90'ies (although there are e few updates), so some information is rather dated.Although the book certainly is no must-have, if you plan to visit Maine (or just have visited it) it may be of interest to get an impression about the place."
3,At Least Gargamel Showed Up,I do not understand why the release of Smurf episdodes is so tedious. Boomerang Network showed better episodes than this DVD during the week before the Smurf Movie premeried.. I still want to know what happened to the epsidoes where Baby Smurf was brought by Stork. I do recall Gargamel in at least one of the episodeas. Placing 10 episodes on two disks should be against the law. However the DVD producers do not care because the Smurf cartoons will sell no matter what episodes are presented.
3,"Love the Episodes, but the Video Quality Could Have Been Better","It seems that Warner Bros. is getting lazy in releasing the full seasons of the Smurfs to DVD, as the video quality is not the best. In A Magical Smurf Adventure, we only get ten episodes on two discs, running about 190 minutes. The back of the DVD box says it is the Second Season, but it is actually mixed episodes from the entire series. Talk about false advertisement! Why doesn't Warner Bros. just release a full season for us fans? I'm hoping with the new Smurf movie sequel being released next year, that maybe there will a new Smurf full season DVD out.Disc 1:Smurf Van WinkleRevenge of the SmurfsThe Magic FountainSmurf Me No FlowersThe Cursed CountryDisc 2:The Blue PlagueThe Ring of CostellacA Mere TruffleGormandizing GreedySister SmurfSPECIAL FEATURES:Smurf Speak; Express Yourself the Smurf WaySmurftastic Moments: 10 Top Moments from the Smurfs' Second Season"
3,nice but very warm,"really like the sleepsacks for ease of use as well as not having to use a blanket but for infants who like to be swaddled, it doesn't work because it is so loose. Also, having a baby too warm has been linked to SIDS as well, so I would suggest the cotton ones more than the fleece ones and keeping your room at a more comfortable temp instead."
2,"Great Concept, Questionable Quality","The sack is an essential for babies and I love everything about this product except the inverted zipper. They break easily. I have two Halo sleep sacks, both with broken zippers. Buy a sack instead of a blanket! Just not this one..."
5,No baby should be without this,"My youngest could NOT sleep without this sleepsack. We bought the very biggest ones available (XL) so she wouldn't outgrow them and she used them most of her first year. A fantastic shower gift, too!"
5,One of our best purchases,"This is one of the best things we bought for our little guy. Like a lot of new parents, we're terrified of letting him sleep with a blanket while he's under 6 months because of the increased risk of SIDS. I don't know how substantial the risk actually is, but no matter how small, we'd probably sleep a little less because of it. This keeps him warm, and works great."
5,great item and baby loves it,I love these sleep sacks. They keep my baby snuggly warm and I don't have to worry about a blanket which might fall over and cover his mouth. Highly recommend.
1,"cute idea, AWFUL zipper","The Sleepsack is a great idea for babies - keeps them warm with their arms free and no blanket to kick over their heads, but the zipper on this brand is just awful. Unfortunately Halo seems to be sold everywhere - we ended up with 3 of these in different weights and sizes and the zippers on all of them are cheap and hard to zip up. Trying to get this on a sleepy baby is next to impossible because you end up wrestling with the zipper and waking the baby every time. I thought it was maybe just a fluke bad zipper with the first one we tried out, but all 3 of our sleep sacks have the same problem."
2,no sleeves=cold arms,"We keep our house pretty cold at night in the winter, and I always worry that my son's arms will get cold. I found Carter's sleeping bag outfits with long sleeves to be much more useful. They are the same basic ideas as the Halo, but they have long sleeves and the zipper zips up instead of down. I use the Halo with terry or fleece pajamas and/or with a long-sleeved bodysuit, but then my son's trunk tends to get too warm, aggravating a rash on his chest and belly. Now that he sleeps on his tummy much of the time (once they start turning over there's nothing we can do about it!), the rash is a real problem."
5,Great for cold weather!,"Love this product. Fits my 29 lb, 17 month old toddler perfectly with room to stand in his crib and move around, but prevents him from trying to climb out. Don't know what I will do when he grows out of it, as he will not sleep with a blanket on. I may just have to buy two of them and sew a giant one of my own!"
3,I had bad luck with the zippers,"I had problems with the zippers on two micro-fleece Halo sacks. One was gently used for 3 mos by my best friend and the other was brand new. On both, the zippers stick all the time, which is a real nuisance with a squirmy baby. I actually just broke the zipper on the used one trying to un-stick it last night. (I'm not a violent (un)dresser.) And last complaint: if I failed to line up the zippers properly (surprisingly easy with a squirmer), I might ""think"" it was zipped and discover he unzipped it from the top later... The fleece was okay, nothing special. I'm here looking for another brand because I love the idea of the sleep sacks. I'm just not a fan of this brand."
1,WILL NOT PREVENT SIDS,"It is important to note, that nothing can prevent sudden infant death. This is a good invention to remove blankets altogether, but I would recommend one made of 100% cotton rather than fleece."
5,very happy with the sleepsack,"Love the sleepsacks. My daughter is 10 months old, and will not a keep a blanket on her. This keeps her plenty warm on these cold nights. Very pleased with the SleepSack."
5,"Fantastic sleep sack, dries quickly after laundering!","This is a great product, nice and warm for winter. The fleece ensures it dries fairly quickly after laundering. The X-Large and large are not vastly different in size. The X-large worked out well for our child. I wouldn't recommend it in spring/fall as the fleece makes it very warm, but it is perfect for winter. I don't know what we would have done without this, it was the only way to ensure our little guy stayed warm at night because he would just kick off ordinary blankets. Plus the sleep-sack ensures they don't get blankets on their face, etc, so their breathing is OK.A huge plus is that unlike many other brands it unzips from the bottom - making it easy to do night-time diaper changes."
5,Great sleep sack!,"This is a nice, cozy fleece sleep sack for the winter months. My son sleeps well in these esp. since we can't use blankets in the cribs these days. I love the puppy dog print on this one:). Very cute!"
2,Great except for the zipper,"This is a great product, but the zipper is frustratingly a failure. It constantly fails to catch and comes apart in the night."
4,Why didn't I buy one sooner?,"Excellent product. She can't kick it off like a normal blanket. Love how the zipper zips up from the bottom, making night time diaper changes a breeze. The fleece is soft and warm, sometimes too warm. If you buy one, it wouldn't hurt to buy the fleece one AND a cotton one for warmer nights."
1,Disappointed,"I like that this garment is flame resistant, that it is spacious and sleeveless, but that's about it. The fabric has an unpleasant feel and the zipper began to break after only one use. It continually splits from the wrong end, so every time the baby wakes up, she's come out of it. I regret this purchase."
5,No chemical flame retardants,"I was relieved to find the Halo wearable blanket was not treated with chemical flame retardant, as are most fleece PJs for infants and toddlers. I confirmed this with the company (which kindly replied to my query). My son can wear regular cotton PJs under this sleepsack and stay warm for the winter. And I can rest easier knowing it's not treated with harmful chemicals. The XL fits just right for him at 20 months."
4,glad I got the large size,"This was a very good alternative to using blankets for my baby in the winter. Very glad I got the large size instead of medium when I purchased it. My baby really grew quickly into it. Love the zipper going from top to bottom, give easy access to checking and even changing her diaper in the middle of the night."
5,Best blanket ever,"Love these sleep sacks! Keeps my little guy warm even though he moves a lot in his sleep. Also, he can't climb out of his crib in the sleep sack. Cute pattern!"
4,LOVE Halo Sleepsacks!,"I absolutely love this product. We have several of them and use them every night. My only negative is the price. I bought two of these and then found them in new condition for $3.50 at our local kid's clothing resale shop. Needless to say, I will be checking there first from now on."
5,love it!,"This is the perfect sleepsack for my baby-- he's too long for the 0-9 month ones, and this is exactly what we needed to make it through the winter!"
5,A Must Have!,"It's simple: the SleepSacks help prevent SIDS, keep baby warm, and provide a signal to your baby at night (or for each nap) that it is time to go to bed. For those concerned that it is too constricting... such is not the case. My oldest (20 months) can walk around in her crib in her sleep sack! My little one (5 months) rolls around with no problem. As for the pilling others have mentioned, try washing it inside out. I have found that it helps considerably."
4,Warm and practical,"I love this product, my child have been use it since he was born, he's 16 months now. It's a safe way to keep him warm all nigth long. Good quality."
5,AWESOME!!,Sometimes at night it gets chilly and in just a sleeper my little girl's toes would be cold. Once I started using these her tootsies were always warm. She also started sleeping better through the night too.We get to cuddle up with a comforter at night but blankets aren't advised for infants... These are better than a blanket anyway!
3,"Great product, but......","This may seem a bit nit-picky, especially since the concept of the SleepSack is wonderful. I received several fleece sleepsacks as shower gifts, and they did not hold up well to washings. Despite following the label instructions, they were pilling after the FIRST wash. Of course, I will continue to use them, but I did notice that the fleecy fabric does not hold up as well as the cotton or the quilted fabric."
5,AWESOME- I LOVE THESE!!!,"I am admittedly overly protective of my daughter (now 20 months.) We've had her in these since she was 4 months old. They are great. You can get ones for summer, ones for winter, ones with no feet, ones with feet, different colors and patterns. Rather than her kicking off her blanket and be cold and/or bury her face in the blanket (which I cannot take), she loves these and they keep her warm and her parents calm. I saw that HALO started making them for 2-3 year olds--THANK YOU HALO!"
5,snuggly warm,The sleep sack is wonderful ~ what a great idea to put babies in these instead of trying to keep blankets on them! And safer too! great product.
5,Warm and cute,"My 18 month daughter has been sleeping in the Halo sleep sacks since she was just a few months old. This one is great for the winter, keeps her warm and cozy. In the summer, we use the cotton ones. The large size is HUGE on her, but it is not a problem since she can actually shuffle around in it, looking like Casper the Ghost."
5,Love it,Our son started sleeping thru the night once we started using the sleep sack. We swaddled him for the first 3 months but once he became a little stronger he was able to break out in the middle of the night. He would kick covers off and get cold in the middle of the night causeing him to wake up. Once we started using the sleep sack he started sleeping all night.
5,Too Big!! But We Love It Anyway...,"This is a great product, really. I actually tried to make one of these myself recently since it is such a genius idea. The sizing however, is WAY too big. I bought the XL for my son (who usually wears size 24m in clothing) and it is truly Extra-Large. Even so, he wears it at bedtime and is able to stand in his crib without tripping over himself in the morning. I suppose I should be happy that it is big and he will grow into it.... But if you want a nice comfortable fit (still with room to move around) , you should probably order a size down.The product itself looks exactly how it appears on amazon. It has really given me peace of mind at bedtime, since my son loves to roll around and uncover himself all night... I think this is a necessity for babies 3+ months (particularly if you live somewhere not so warm)..."
2,Tight armholes,"My LO hates his sleep sack. The arm holes are extremely tight on him and he fights me each time I tried to use it (I stopped). The couple nights we put him in this he didn't sleep well at all. If your baby has ""chunky"" arms at all, I do not recommend buying it. It did keep him warm, but again he didn't like it."
3,X-Large is too large,"I love the Halo sleepsacks in general, but the extra large is just enormous. My child is one year, and I thought the X-Large would be good for 1 year to 18 months. Intsead, it looks better suited to a 2-year-old. I returned it and got a large, which is great."
5,I LOVE sleep sacks,"I never have to worry if they're warm enough, or if the covers are being kicked off (or for the real young ones, having blankets in there at all)."
5,Must have for fall and winter babies!,I bought this for my son who was born in November. What a difference in his sleeping after we began using it! I did not have to worry about him pulling it over his face and he was very snug all night. I tried the other wrapping blankets but he always kicked his feet out. I bought about 4-5 of these so he always had one even for naps!
5,Comfortable blanket and can be used for several months,Loved this blanket. I wished it had sleeves too. It can be used for several months as its very long.
5,So Warm and Cute!,"I bought this to fit my son who is 6 months old, but a super chunk a dunk. He's over 20 pounds. He literally squealed with delight when he saw this sleep sack and was so excited to put it on. It's soft, gives him plenty of room to kick and move, and has been keeping him toasty for these cold Winter nights."
4,Good product,The sleep sack is nice and warm for my baby. The color and applique is cute. Great option for blankets.
5,A breath of fresh air,"In a breath of fresh air, the talented Bonnie McKee has blazed into the musical world with truthful lyrics that almost all teenagers can relate to--the ups and downs of years of misery and joy, of hopelessness and faith. I especially liked ""Trouble"", ""Somebody"", and ""January"". There is no denying her talent, and I strongly recommend everyone to buy this CD, the first of many more great albums to come from this young but strong artist."
5,Bonnie Mckee is Awesome!,"Bonnie Mckee is one of the best new musical artists these days. With her flame-red hair and cool style, she has a spicy attitude that stands out. Her songs (all written by Bonnie) demonstrate her beautiful vocal range and her lyrics have a special quality to them that are rare these days. Her talent is outstanding and you shouldn't miss these fantastic tracks. This is a perfect gift for the holidays that nobody will be able to stop listening to."
5,UGHMAZING,"This cd is UGHMAZING...i had heard a few of the songs on a special player on the website and liked them, bought the cd, and i cannot stop listening to it. it is SO good. she is THE BEST new musician out right now. and i was thrilled! to hear see in the insert that she writes all the lyrics and music which we don't see much of from artist now adays. really good you should definatlely check this artist out."
3,A Blah attempt at pop music,"So I think Bonnie McKee has a phenomenal voice, but I swear listening to her cd is tolerable for about 30 seconds / 1 minute and then I want to skip ahead the song, and then I'm doing it for almost every song on there..I dunno.. that one song ""Somewhere"" is good. Which is I guess why it was put on the ""win a date with tad hamilton"" soundtrack. But I could easily listen to that one song and none of the others and not miss out on anything. So I can't really say it's worth it to buy this cd. I mean, it's not that she doesn't have talent when it comes to her voice. It's just that she doesn't have any talent when it comes to song writing or being interesting. Which somewhat defeats the purpose of making a cd I think. I dunno. When grammy winning people start writing songs for her to sing, and then mixing the tracks for her, maybe then I'd pick her up again. Until then pass on this cd."
4,Indeed a collection off the beaten track,"This valuable collection is not only comprehensive, but also off the beaten track. It contains an amazing variety of short stories, including some of the well-known masterpieces. My favorites in this collection are ""The swimmer"" (an outstanding example of the grotesque), as well as the thrilling story about ""The baby in the ice-box"" (sheer captivating story-telling). Rarely had so much fun reading a short story. There are many less funny stories here as well, if you prefer. And you meet many famous writers in little-known stories, which are quite characteristic. Even O Henry is present with a true masterpiece."
3,Worth some very selective viewing,I bought this for the first 3 episodes which show Galactica finally finding Earth and the last episode to find out about Starbuck's fate. Everything else in this is an embarrassment to the sci-fi community.
4,Good cabinet for the price,"Ordered two of these for the girls' room. Assembly is time consuming but not particularly difficult, about on par with expectations for a piece of furniture that comes in a box. Both had issues with cosmetic damage on panels (busted corners and scratched veneer) but had been taken care of by calling the manufacturer. They just needed the part number and lot number from the owner's manual and shipped replacement parts free of charge. The replacement parts arrived in massive protective packaging (several layers of foam and cardboard). Even so, the need to get extra parts meant about a week delay in completing the assembly, which is why I'm deducting one star. At this price the cabinet should be packaged to arrive in 100% condition. The finished product is nice, good quality both in terms of fit and function, as well as appearance. Overall I recommend it and would purchase again."
4,Good file cabinet,"I am really glad my husband is handy! Lots of pieces to put together, took him several hours. I do like the cabinet now that it has been assembled."
4,looks good,The cabinet arrived quickly. Assembly was alright. The difficult part being aligning the drawers and making sure they opened smoothly. All in all I would buy the cabinets again.
5,One of the Greats!,"Just as Frank Wootton was a significant inspiration to him, he too (Keith Ferris) is mine! Keith's works are so exact that it's no wonder he wasn't an Industrial Designer.My father introduced me to his art for the first time from this book ""THE AVIATION ART OF KEITH FERRIS"" and right off the bat I was amazed. I am beginning to collect his books and learn from his techniques and someday would like to meet him."
5,Great Suburban Philadelphia Ghost Story,"A well written book featuring the haunting of a real house on Rose Tree Road in Media, PA. It is spellbinding, painting a picture of life in a house where you never know what will happen next. The Cameron family went through hell! The cover picture shows the house as it looked before a fire in the 1980's. Unfortunately the focal point of the initial tragedy, the huge 175 yr old Copper Beach beside the house, was cut down just a few years ago. The house was restored in the mid 1990s when a new development was built on the surronding land. Unfortunately for us locals most of the identifying characteristics of the house are now gone. This book is a great read, especially if you're familiar with Suburban Philadelphia"
1,Worst repair manual ever,"I own a 2000 Ford Windstar, and I purchased this book to help me with minor repairs. After attempting to use this book to make several different repairs, it appears that the only part of this book that is accurate is the photograph of the Windstar on the cover.My 2000 Windstar was built way differently than the way it is depicted in this manual. If I were to have followed the instructions and illustrations in this book, I would have destroyed my van trying to disassemble it in the manner in which this book describes. The parts shown in this book are completely different than those on my van, and the way my van was assembled is completely different also. Ford must have really changed the assembly of the Windstar during the 9-years that this book covers.Chilton manuals aren't what they used to be."
2,Not good for the 2002,This didn't match the 2002 Ford Windstar at all. Basically it was useless for me. Ford changed so many things on the 2002 that I had to resort to looking for hours online on the ford forums to find someone who was able to figure out how to force the Serpentine belt off so we could access the power steering pump. The schemantics are 100% different than in the book.
3,Windstar Manual just OK,The manual was not detailed enough for the work I had to do. Don't recommend it for transmission issues.
2,a pretty sad excuse for a maiden tribute,"There are some obvious flaws on the piano tribute to iron maiden CD. First is the price. This is a horrible tribute and it costs way too much. the only reason i'd buy this is if your grandmother wanted to hear some of your favorite music and if it was in the bargain bin for 3 bucks. The second problem is...well....when are you even going to listen to this? The grand piano sounds great and everything but a little too loud to sleep. But this is no rock album either. The guitars, bass. and drums that we all love are gone. I admit it. The song selection is great. But whats the point when they sound this bad? The point is, don't buy this album. waste of money and your music listening time. As for me, i'm going back to the store to sell this piece of crap."
3,Drummer needed: Apply within,"I realize this is supposed to be a ""piano"" tribute to the Irons, but the thing just sounds waaay tooo plain. It needs a rhythm for godsake... I had HOPED it wouldn't have vocals, and I got my wish, sadly it doesn't have anything else BESIDES PIANO! I have to agree the piano sounds a bit ""cheap"" but it could sound a lot worse.The cover art is a crack-up and really attracted me to this. The song selection is also VERY good:) Sadly, all this needed was a drummer or a drum machine to help w/ the timing. If you can find this for $10 it's worth it, if not, pass."
3,Maiden Tributes,Anyone looking for a Maiden tribute album that doesn't suck? Haha! Get Worlds Only Female Tribute to Iron Maiden by the Iron Maidens... these chicks can rock!!!
3,"Entertaining, but...","I like the concept behind this album and the similar albumAnatomy of Evil, but the piano really does sound pretty cheap. It just sounds like an electric keyboard. I think a fuller, richer sound would really evoke the proper feel of Iron Maiden. This just comes off as the kind of thing someone would record and distribute freely, not something that should be sold for $17. I mean, it's enjoyable, until you give it a closer listen. But yeah, it's great for when I've got my grandmother in the car. ;)"
2,Cheap Sounding,"I'm not sure if it's the production or if this was actually recorded on a cheap electric piano, either way it's not a very impressive sounding collection of covers.It was mildly depressing to listen to some of my favorite Maiden tracks become trivialized into a sort of background music. None of the original power, and sometimes not even the correct music - a couple of the songs sound slightly off, as though the key is incorrect or the pianist just strikes a few keys wrong.If you're a collector it might be worth getting, but if you're a collector you'd already have it. Everyone else should probably skip it."
1,terrible,"this is an awful idea translated into an awful album...think about it, Iron Maiden and piano music go together like cookies and ass. It just doesn't work."
1,Eeeeewwwwwww!!,"The only ""coffee experience"" connected with this product is that it makes a hot, coffee-colored beverage. It smells and tastes nasty. I could detect NO coffee flavor, nor any hazlenut flavor. Only by adding chocolate and cinnamon am I able to drink this awful stuff, and I'll do that only so that I won't totally waste my money. Please don't waste your money on this! I gave it one star only because I couldn't give it a negative rating."
4,The first Russian pop contribution for the world's music,This single became the first serious Russian contribution for the world's pop music scene. This song won the second prize on the last year's Eurovision song contest. Alsou is 18 and very popular in Russia for her voice and mostly russian-language songs. Check out her new single 'Before You Loved Me' and her new english-language album soon.
1,NO ONE LIKE ME....I WANT MY MONEY BACK,"I bought this book, as a non-traditional student, with great hopes of hearing stories of people who have had the same anxieties as myself. Unforunately, what I found was a poorly put together group of people who almost all came from some kind of health-care background or medical legacy. The only thing that made these people non-traditional was the fact that they were older. I was hoping for a book full of artists and business people who decided to switch paths, but all I found were stories of phamaceutical reps and EMTs. Aside from subject matter, there isn't a wide range of questions or answers. Basically, if you read one interview, you've read them all. There are so many other books that give an eclectic view of the non-traditional student. Save your money. You'll need it in med-school."
1,Definitely not worth the money!,"After reading the five star review that is on this site, I couldn't wait to read this book. As an already accomplished professional contemplating a return to medical school, I thought that this book would give me the information I needed in order to start off on the right foot. Unfortunately, this was not the case.This book is nothing more than a series of interviews with non-traditional students who have matriculated at Northwestern. I found the information included to be confusing and quite often contradictory. To be honest, I have found more useful information in the general information guides which are written for your standard college student."
1,horrible and not worth purchase,I put this on my phone after my other phone cover (silicone) got a small tear after 3 months of service protecting my phone. The crystal hard case broke within the first day of putting it on. The pins that hold the cover onto the top of the phone have all broken and it is hanging on by a thread (which will break very soon). I would not ever purchase this product again as it has no ability to protect my phone...
3,FUNCIONAN PERO LA VERDAD SI POR LO MENOS TUVIERAN ALGO QUE PARECIERA UN SENSOR DE CAMARA EN VEZ DE PLASTICO .,WORK BUT THE TRUTH IS AT LEAST have what looks like a camera sensor instead of plastic.
5,Vivid book about cavities,"This is an entertaining book to help kids understand why it is so important to brush and eat well, told through the eyes and lives of Karius and Baktus who live in the mouth of a boy who eats only sweets and doesn't brush. My kids (now 12, 7 and 5) all love it."
1,A waste of time and money.,"This book is written in a lowbrow amateur manner that had me nearly giving up reading it by the second chapter. However, I did find some laughs in it, although I doubt the author had intended them. For example:""I leaned back and let go with a heavy sigh, which hung in the air like a choking fog."" - Mothermelters. pg 9One would gather that the author was stating that he had bad breath.It seemed as though Kunzman, the author, had a grudge against a few former co-workers and spent an inordinate amount of time in character assassination of them. The writer tries to paint himself as a gallant knight on a white steed, but only comes across as a Don Quixote chasing windmills. There is very little substance, and no entertaining value in the pages of this book. Save your money and do not buy it."
4,very interesting,"I have heard about the Ted Williams thing at Alcor, but this was an eye-opener. The folks at Alcor have a ton of explaining to do if even half of this book is true. Contrary to other reviews, I found the book to be well written and entertaining, as well as informative. The subject matter is extremely controversial, so I expect that most reviewers on Amazon will have a bias one way or the other (so read the reviews, including this one, with a grain of salt). All in all, a very good read."
5,My favorite L&M Album,"I had the honor of working on this album. It was the first L&M; album recorded at Jimmy's ranch in Ojai, CA with the Haji remote truck and the first of their albums for which I was the technical adviser.From the very beginning you could tell this was going to be a special project. The first vocal we recorded was ""Brighter Days"" which we started recording about midnight. It was an amazing evening and when I listen to this album today I am still taken with the superb audio quality we achieved recording in Jimmy's house and the incredible quality of the music we captured.Working with Jimmy and Kenny will always be one of the highlights of my life."
5,L & M's Masterpiece,"What Hotel California was to the Eagles or Dark Side of the Moon was to Pink Floyd or Tapestry to Carole King - Mother Lode was to Loggins & Messina. This is the career defining album. This is one of those ""if I only had x number of albums to listen to . . . ."" Jimmy Messina was never better as a songwriter or producer, and Kenny Loggins ""Brighter Days"" is (IMHO) the best song he ever wrote, and he's written some good ones.Buy this album."
5,No hits -Just perfection,"Great harmonies, melodies, arrangements, production, lyrics, variety, cohesiveness - What more can I say?Best album ever?"
5,Genius Record,"I love it, again. Years and years ago I bought the album - and thought it was a brilliantly engineered. This album has elements of rock, pop, classical and baroque; makes it complex, which I love. In my opinion makes the whole listening session satisfying."
5,Totally loaded,"This set of songs from L & M whether on lp or cd is without doubt some of the best country /rock music I have ever had the pleasure to sit down and be invovled in. From the first time I heard this music I knew I was listening to something very special, something that would stand tall against the decades since it was produced. In deed the production of this music is superb and I use it still as a measuring stick when comparing it's richness to what has come and gone since it's release. The musicianship is first class and the song writing only adds depth to it's beauty. This music makes me cry with joy when I play it and that is often. A true motherlode more valuable than gold."
4,Made my sister very happy!,My sister had been looking for the cd FOREVER and found it for $30. I found it on here for something like $8.95 and made her Christmas. They still rock her world....!
2,Ineffective,"Regarding the Leukotape, my son's physical therapist recommended this product for his bilateral patellar tendon tears. Unfortunately, the tape he received was not sticky enough to do the job. During workouts it would come lose and become ineffective. He ended up purchasing more tape (which works fine)from the PT -- same exact product but maybe the one he received from Medical Department Stores was old (?). The cover roll works fine."
5,Just what I ordered.,"Great price. Quality product, exactly what you would find in an athletic trainers toolbox or in a physical therapy clinic. It does the job I needed, offering guidance/support with protection. The price point was great, shipping was on time. If I need more products I will check this company out again."
1,not the same as the PT used,"The white cover roll did not stick to my skin as well as the kind used by my physical therapist. I even tried cleansing the skin with alcohol first. When I would perspire under the tape it would slide and make the Leukotape useless. A waste of my money. The box is identical to what the PT used, but is obviously not the same quality."
3,Leukotape Combo,Received item very quickly. Does not stay on well when playing sports. Moisture looses the tape after a period of time.
5,Shin Splint Savior,"I had debilitating shin splints and was in the middle of my training sessions for 10 races in 10 weeks. A physical therapist used this pre-tape and tape to tape my shins and what a difference!!!!!!!!!! This tape is as close to a miracle as anything can be. I have a tape allergy, but this tape doesn't seem to bother me. I think the recommendation is to leave it on for 5 days, but I leave it on about 2 1/2-3 days since I'm super sensitive to the adhesive. I've never had a problem. The tape has allowed my shins to recover and I can return to my training pain free!! Have someone qualified to show you how to use this tape and then enjoy the benefits of doing it yourself at home!"
1,not strong,For some reason it didn't feel as strong as the tape that the physical therapist used on me. It didn't hold add strong our as long. Feel like i wasted money. Sticks well just doesn't hold well
4,Great Stability,I have an unstable back and use the cover stretch tape with the Leukotape over it to stablized my back. I would recommend using the 4 inch coverstretch tape instead of the 2 inch tape for backs. It works great although I have to have someone else apply it.
1,"Dont order, never received this product",This supplier does not seem to be in existance. I ordered for this product in May 2010. Never received this product nor received any response from them
1,Item pictured is not the one I received.,I wanted to save time and get the tape for a sports injury. I was disappointed when I received the wrong product. Now I have to order the other tape. :(
4,great training trunk,Good trunk for training. The tiny holes and the slight bagginess of the trunk allows for a slight drag that creates resistance to strengthen your strokes. Plus it has the hadded bonus of discretion. You guys know what I'm talking about....
3,Close but not quite...,"I got this suit both for training as well as to wear to the beach or recreational swimming. The mesh isn't see thru due to a solid fabric layer underneath. The material also looks pretty good.However the cut of the suit leaves something to be desired. I thought that since it's considered a square leg suit, the legs would extend a bit below the crotch of the suit. Big negative; in reality its cut more like brief underwear. And since the suit is meant to be baggy for training, it looks like baggy brief underwear. I think it looks like a diaper to be honest.And despite the legs being tight to keep everything inside this looser suit, it will not keep you covered if your legs are spread 45 degrees or so apart.It should hold up to regular use in chlorinated water tho. I would use this ONLY as a training suit. Had this suit utilized this mesh material and the square leg cut that is used on suits made of stretchy material, it coulda been worn anywear you wear a swimsuit to."
4,Too tight around upper thighs,"I am a size 30 in jeans so I thought it would be fine if I ordered a size 30 in these. I had seen other posts recommending to order a sizer bigger but I though: ""Nah, that can't be my case.""I got a size 30 and everything fit nicely except for the part above the thighs. It felt really tight, as if it was going to cut off blood flow. I am super fit, swimmer build but I guess my thighs are above average thickness.I've ordered a size 32 and it was a little tight still but better fit.You might have to order 1 to 2 sizes bigger depending on the thickness of your legs.Otherwise, they seem to be a great product. I've tried them out in the pool, no complaints. I feel more comfortable wearing them because they have a looser look due to the mesh. They look great."
4,Great,"this is a great speedo. i ordered size 34, but wear a 32 pant. the speedo fits perfectly. when purchasing, i chose the sapphire/white color, but received the sapphire/black. i didnt mind the color, but be warned if you plan on purchasing the sapphire/white color. thats why i gave 4/5."
5,Very satisfied,"After discarding two previously purchased swim trunks due to poor fit and fading color, I purchased these to great satisfaction. They fit well, the color does not fade, and they dry quickly. I highly recommend them."
2,Weird Suit,Unless you like your thighs to feel like they have a tourniquet on them - don't buy this suit. I have pretty thin legs being primarily a runner and not so much a swimmer and I feel like the circulation is being cut off in my thighs although they are plenty big in the waist and butt. These are going directly back to Amazon. Very strange cut in my opinion. I've been doing triathlons for 22 years off and on and never had a suit fit so strangely. I will try again to find the Speedo suit I had previously.
4,Great suit for lap swimming,"Fits well in the waist, crotch and butt. It's a little snug in the leg bands, but not uncomfortable. It's made out of 100% long-lasting polyester for lots of laps in the pool."
3,Too tight,This swim suit was just too uncomfortable for me. It looks nice but it was just too tight around the legs. I have muscular legs due to biking but they're not that big. Had to return this one.
4,you need some real balls to wear this,I bought this for my grandad because he likes to wear speedos! but no complaints they last for years. The last one I got him was 5 years ago and he swims everyday. He wanted a new one because he wanted a change.
3,get them a size smaller,I liked the picture so I grabbed them. for me should have got a couple sizes smaller because when I got them they looked like old lady underwear. I'm a 30 waist and should have got about a 28 or so. they still look nice. trying to shrink them in the dryer.
4,great suit,"the suit is tight around the legs, takes some getting used too. Other than that it is a great product. I highly recommend it."
5,Good for training,"We purchased this suit for my son to be used as a drag suit for training. He had always used jammers or briefs while training as says that he can feel the additional resistance when he swims, which is exactly what he was looking for."
2,Living Landscapes HD Rocky Mountains,"Overal, not really what we were looking for, it is such a struggle to HD DVD's in Australia and at the time we thought it was for a HD DVD. Dissapointed when we received it and saw that it was actually for PC's with Windows Media.However, not your mistake, more a case of ""look better"" before you purcahse next time.Will appreaciate it if you can let me know if this DVD is available as a HD DVD?RegardsPieter"
4,Fun,"its fun however not played as much as DDR. it would be a lot better if they would make more home version. its too bad arcades around seattle dont have pump it up so there really not much of an arcade comunity.i can past most songs up to 13, it just involves paterns and mashing arrows. not so much beat with the large timing window. its was worth playing arcade endlessly just for canon d and dignity."
5,Played it since middle school and still loving it in colllege,I absolutely love this game but the description was quite misleading. It sounds as if they send you two mats but instead they only give one. That was my biggest issue. Aside from that there was a song that was suppose to be on this game but isn't here. Regardless I still love this game much more than DDR :)
4,Family fun,Great to bring your wife to PS2 world. It's fun but it's kind of complicated to learn how to beat the game/machine.Song tracks could be more interesting- doesn't need to be todays Bilboard Top 100. It could be a sample ot Bilboard TOP 300 for the last ten years.
4,a different side of john belushi,"I saw this movie the other night and I was captivated. I only thought that John Belushi was a comedic actor. I watched and watched as I saw that there was more to John Belushi than meets the eye. The film shows the Animal House John Belushi in the beginning but later shows a different actor. The movie shows that he is a compassionate person. In short, I loved this movie I think that John Belushi is an extremely talented actor. I think it is ashame that he passed away at such an early age. I think thatn he could have made an important contribution to the film industry."
5,Excellent movie!,This movie is a great story of 2 people living 2 very different lifestyles. It's funny and very real. I absolutely enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone. Thank you Amazon for the speedy delivery!
4,One of my favorite movies,"Lawrence Kasdan script, Blair Brown, Steven Spielberg as EP. What more could you ask for in a cute 80s romantic comedy?"
5,For a fun time this is it~Continental Divide,Now this is a nice good clean comedy suitable for the entire family.I loved it. It has a few surprises tucked inside it to keep you amused. Good all around fun movie.
4,Continental Divide,"Purchased this for a friends birthday. She wore out the VHS tape, glad to have found it on DVD for her continued enjoyment."
3,"Charming, though thin romantic comedy","A highly unlikely, though heartwarming romance between two very different individuals, CONTINENTAL DIVIDE features a trying-much-too-hard John Belushi, and a lusterlack Blair Brown. The background info about the making of the movie is much more interesting than the film itself (Belushi lost 30 pounds for the part). However, I watch this idealistic romantic comedy often because it reminds me that if you really want something, there is a way to make it happen!"
2,A little disappointed,"I was expecting it to be as funny as ""The Great Outdoors"". Although it was okay, was a little dissapointed."
5,One of my all time favorite movies,If you love John Belushi - you will love this movie! I was so happy to see that I could get it from Amazon - I have it at my house in two days! Love that movie - Love Amazon
5,Continental Divide,"This is John Belushi's finest moments, I could watch this movie over many times, I highly recommend this movie will be a great addition to anyones collection."
3,dryer review,"We have space concerns like most people and this fits in nicely. Runs completely silent. Doesn't dry as quickly as we would like, especially when using it for gloves. Don't really notice any warmth as product claims it drys and warms."
1,Melted in the first 30 minutes!,I bought this boot dryer for my hunny who is a hunter. He turned it on for an hour this morning to dry his boots and gloves and the plastic around the vents melted and morphed. So now it is useless. Would not recommend!
2,Not Working after 6 Uses,"I ordered this 12 Jan 2011--received and starting using around 21 Jan 2011. It broke 1 May 2011. Used maybe 6 times. I called Pacific Outdoors and they tell me it was a discontinued item and Amazon purchased all they had. I had to go to Amazon for resolution. Amazon warranty ended 24 Feb 2011. Product did work well the 6 times I used it, but it would cost more to mail back to Amazon than the partial payment Amazon's offers. Off to the dump with this one. No more Pacific Outdoor products for me"
3,Not exceptional,Rather disappointing ... perhaps my fault for not reading the description carefully. Spanish language thrillers are not my cup of tea.
4,nice stuff,"Light, nice fragrance, good for dry skin...but watch out for your slippery bathtub afterwards, or the next bather might take a header."
1,NOT AVAILABLE,"ITEM ON BACK ORDER FOR 3 WEEKS, THEN TOLD ME THEY JUST CAN'T GET IT. UNFORTUNATELY I WAS HOPING TO GET THIS FOR A GIFT FOR MY WIFE."
5,JAZZ WOLF IS THE GREATEST,"Jazz Wolf is the greatest release ever. It has inspired me to do great things through the soothing sounds of mellow saxaphone along with the howling of wolves. I let the comforting melody of Jazz Wolf woo me to sleep every night. Sleeping to this album gives me the feeling that I am in a mystical secluded cave surrounded by friendly, cuddly wolves that are shredding on the sax. YO JAZZ WOLF. KEEP ON PLAYING THAT SAX."
1,One of the funniest recordings I've ever heard,What better comment on this music could there be than a bunch of howling canines?Music: 1 starBest unintentional comedy recording: 5 stars.
1,Dear God.,"I couldn't help but notice that people who have purchased this ""music"" have also purchased titles by Enya. Seems about right.What is this? Wolf noises over smooth jazz? This is a good idea? Has everyone lost the premise that art respresents life...it isn't actually life? If I were to paint a tree, I wouldn't staple an elm to a canvas...I guess there's an audience for almost anything, and the Monte Carlo SS-crowd needs something to listen to while dusting their Precious Moments figurines...but...this is just so nasty.The first track is really just David Benoit-sounding icky smooth jazz laid over the sound of a wolf howling. It's really bad.Later tracks apply this same ""magic formula"" to other ""natural"" sounds.If this ever seemed like a good idea to anyone, I assure you that concept fell apart on the road to final product.So icky."
4,Only in the 80's...,"What a great soundtrack and memory from my youth. Saw this movie when I was about 11 or so. The film is a loose take on the opera The Pirates Of Penzance, 80's style. Some very catchy songs on here. The two leads Christopher Atkins and Kristy McNichol make the movie, and do a great job singing on their songs. Some people might call this all cheese and I'd understand it, but it's the good kind you've just got to eat up! I highly recommend both film and soundtrack. You may have found that there is no CD of this anymore, if there ever was. The record or cassette are usually quite high-priced used on the net. However if you're lucky you might find the vinyl at a Salvation Army or Goodwill store for 99 cents, like I did a few hours ago."
2,Waste of Time,"After reading this book (well, reading the first half and skimming the second half), I was curious to see what other reviewers have written. Honestly, I can't believe how many good reviews she received! I've read all of Judith McNaught's and most of Andrea Kane's historical romances - and they blow this book away! In a nutshell, Adrian was a jerk and Lilliana was stupid. Adrian's friends, the two other Rakes, could have potenitally added some much needed humor, but they were only allowed in a few brief scenes. I repeat, a complete waste of time."
3,One more book with a promising start and disappointing ending,"This was one more book with a promising beginning where we could watch the hero and heroine slowly and reluctantly fall in love. However, it wasn't so. Lilliana was wonderful - caring, patient, determined. However, Adrian was one annoying, stubborn idiot. No matter what Lilliana did, he never trusted her and preferred to believe his brother, who already betrayed him. Except for the time when he was blind, he was totally unlikable. That and Lilliana are the reasons I gave this book three stars.This was the first London's book I read and it is probably also the last."
3,The misunderstandings get very old,"Otherwise, the book was an enjoyable read. But as the misunderstandings continue and the lead couple seem not only unable but unwilling to trust, this reader began to wish for the book to end. And it ended very, very well, It just took too long. It almost seemed that London nearly finished the book, realized it was too short, and picked up another (and ultimately disheartening) series of misunderstandings and distrust. 3.5 stars for wearing me out with the lack of trust and heavy doses of psychology. Otherwise I'd have given it 4 stars. I cried a lot, and I liked it well enough to read the rest of the series."
3,Pretty Good,"Julia London is generally a good storyteller, and there are parts of this book that are extremely well-written and humorous, especially those where the heroine attempts to shake the hero's disinterest; these are amusing enough in themselves to justify reading the book.However, I do not consider this book on par with some of her other novels. I really didn't like the hero that much, nor did I find all of his psychological problems particularly interesting. I find it implausible when 18th century characters spout 20th century college psychology. And I find one of the basic premises, that he would kill his best friend, to lack credibility.With that disclaimer, this isn't a bad read, just not as good as some of her other books."
2,I now know what I want,"I suppose a thank you is inorder to Ms. London because this novel has made it clear what I like in the romance genre. And it is not this book. I should have placed higher value on mrsgiggles review. I, too, don't appreciate a juvenile, petty, abusive, self pitying hero. Unfortunately the heroine in this book didn't have much to choose from in the hero category. In most cases give me Amanda Quick aka Jayne Krentz, Julie Garwood, Catherine Coulter and Nora Roberts. Their heroes and heroines may have problems but they are also entertaining and not constantly sniveling about their lot in life. A man can be rough around the edges, that's character, but forever misunderstanding and wallowing in it and then taking it out on the woman who stands by him...well no thanks. Even when Adrian ""acknowledges"" his love his first thought is how Lillie can ""save"" him...so much for his love, it's still all about him not them."
3,Julia London Has Written Better,"I gave this story three stars because it was good in some areas. I could not put it down until I finished it. I gave it three stars because I could not understand why the characters did some of the things they did. I could not understand why Adrian married the heroine for revenge. I felt horrible for the things he went through, but marrying someone to hurt his brother was so cruel and vicious. It was mean to his brother and downright cruel to use a woman that way who did absolutely nothing to deserve it. I like strength in a character and marrying the woman his brother wanted to hurt him is so cruel and juvenile I could not find respect for him. The way he told Lilliana his motives after they married to hurt her was even worse. Adrian struck out at his wife constantly when he was hurt or his ego was struck. He was hurt and he lashed out to hurt other people. I felt so sorry for his wife because at the end of the story I did get the feeling that he changed."
2,Tediously Dull,"Sorry as an avid romance reader I must say I hate books that I have to force my self to finish, Because I actually finished this book is the only reason I am even giving it 2 stars. As another reviewer said the bickering gets old the same old argument for at least %75 of the book, and a dull one at that, however I am a stickler of reading an entire series and so I have learned the the 2nd book is marginally better, only buy this book if you truly feel like boring your self to sleep."
2,An disappointment,"I bought this book for the favourable reviews of other readers but I was disappointed. The relatively more entertaining part of this book was the outrageous things that Liliana did to get Adrian's attention. However, it went all the way downhill from there. I couldn't understand why Adrian considered his father's estate was his 'rightful inheritance' when he thought himself the bastard son of his mother. It is alright to have a brooding hero but not a petty one. What was there in that man for any woman to fall in love with ?"
3,Predicatable if you read a lot . . .,"Pleasing characters and well thought out plot-lines burdened by predicatable stubborness, tantrums and unique-for-the-era skills by our heroine,,, A pleasant time-filler of a tale."
1,"Better than Judith McNaught, YOU MUST BE JOKING","I have to agree whole heartedly with mrsgiggles review of this book. Too bad I bought the book anyway. I made it to page 95 before I just couldn't stand it anymore. I almost put it down when on page 61 he called her a ""bumpkin"". The final straw was when he had almost forgotten his bride the morning after his wedding because hs was preoccupied with finding a packet he had misplaced after a night of ""whor..."" with his friends Julian and Phillip. Adrian is a complete jerk; too bad the outcome of the duel was not reversed - but I have a feeling it wouldn't have been much better of a story. Lilliana got on my nerves from the moment she met Adrian. As you can probably tell, I won't be picking up any more Julia London's books."
5,WOW!!,"Video quality: Excellent - 10/10 . Camera work is great, with beautiful close-ups where you get to see ASM fingers playing the violin, BPO members playing their instruments and SJ's expressive conducting.Audio quality: Excellent - 10/10Performances: Excellent - 10/10I've viewed this BD several times in the past year and I enjoy it more amnd more with each new viewing! What more could one ask for? I'm so glad to have bought this BD. It's a MUST have for all fans and anyone with even a minimal interest in classical music."
5,Lively and beautiful performance.,"The collaboration between Maestro Ozawa and Violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter, with the members of the Vienna Philharmonic gave a very refreshing and energetic lively and beautiful performance of the Beethoven Violin Concerto. There were often seems of joyful and mischievous merry making that gave a fitting tribute to the late Maestro Von Karajan. The Stearneness of the more seriousness demands of the piece, came into their own, as if Beethoven would have demanded himself. The performance of Tchaikovsky's Sixth was a fitting tribute to both the composer and to the memory of the late Maestro Von Karajan. The exciting and somber scenes were very meticulously blended without seemingly great effort."
4,Great picture and performance,"This is my first blu-ray classical music disc and the picture is stunning.The performance (Orchestra, soloist and conductor) is also of the highest quality. I have two issues with this disc1- The sound (in stereo) is good but not in the same league with the picture and performance2- the bonus material about Karajan cannot be approached (as the other reviewer said)"
2,Wonderful concert- defective disc,"This concert is everything the first reviewer said!! However, I have received 2 defective copies. Neither disc will allow me to play the Karajan bonus material which of course is essential to the disc. I have tried both discs on 2 Sony Blue Ray players- the 350 and the 550. I can only hope the manufacturer corrects the problem."
3,Mediocre production values spoil,"Disappointing disc - flat sound stage, poor channel separation, annoying camerawork with frequent poorly composed shots. Unfortunate because I'm sure the concert was fantastic live but these failings make the blu ray experiencce of it somewhat ordinary."
1,"ozawa ""conducting"" for von karajan??",Talk about an insult. Ozawa was ok with Boston but to have him attemting to conduct a memorial concert for one of tghe greatest conductors of the 2oth century!!?? What idiot conceived this? Give it an honourable burial. But don't bother listening. It's horrible start to finish.
5,With One Puff of the Chron,"...this album is HOT!!!! 17 Original tracks with one hidden track (...). This is one of the best compilation of talent seen in awhile, and all from the NJ/NY area so it's even more phenemenal. Volcanik Entertainment has really produced a quality product that makes DJ's who just make remixes look like untalented ego driven POP type artists. Let me just leave you folks with this.......Buy this album and be amazed with the original beats, original rhymes and original artists and producers who hit you with some ill Tracks."
5,Adorable children's book,"This book is adorable. My son had received the other Karma Wilson, ""Bear snores On"" for Christmas and he loves it, so I thought I'd purchase another in the series of books. This book is fun, has a great story, beautiful illustrations, and I love how it parallels all the friends Bear has in this book with the other. I would highly recommend this book!"
4,"Nothing Ground-Breaking, But Should Please Toddler Fans of Bear","My two-year-old son is a big fan of the Bear stories (starting with the classic, ""Bear Snores On"") and enjoyed this latest adventure. The art was lovely (the same as the other Bear stories) and all of the familiar characters are there. The rhyme seemed more labored and less lyrical to my adult ear, but my son didn't seem to mind. It didn't become an instant favorite for him, but he's pulled it out several times for re-reads and paged through out on his own, as well.It's a sturdy, chunky board book (same form factor/style as other Bear board stories) that should hold up well to my son's often less-than-careful little hands."
5,Sweet story of new friends,"This is one of the 3-year-old daughter's current favorites. She asks for it at least once a day, usually wanting it to be read several times each time.Like most board books, the story is simple. Bear and his friends hear an odd noise in the forest and are wondering who is making it. Eventually they find a shy, small owl and make friends with him.This might be a cute book for a painfully shy preschooler since it shows how the people you are afraid of may actually be good friends in the end."
3,Bear asks who?,"This 4th book in the series in pleasing and entertaining with a dash of suspense.The illustrations are beautiful and the story is good, however bear's persistent question ""who?"" is a little jarring and makes for a slightly annoying read. Doesn't quite go with the tone of the book. The author could have thought up a better word or phrase to keep the story moving."
5,My littles love it,"I'm a mother of five children, ages 7 down to 1 year old. The three ""littles"" as I call them, immediately opened up the book and began oohing and ahhing over the animals and the pictures. I've now read this to them at least a dozen times. The pictures are bright and engaging, and even allow the little ones to make up their own stories and ""read"" to one another.It's sturdy, slick, and an easy, quick read. Very very pleased.Sra. GoseMother of Five, Spanish Teacher, AuthorFlip Flop Spanish Series"
4,Such a cute book...,"This book is adorable! My sons and I have all of the bear series and this one is their new favorite. We've almost got it memorized (the rhyming makes that very easy) and have a lot of fun doing voices and actions along with the story. I wasn't AS impressed with the rhyme in this one as compared to her other bear stories, but it is still an awesome book :)Get it, your kids will thank you."
4,Cute Story,"This was a very nice book to read to my son, with great pictures for him to look at. It was a nice story about meeting someone new and becoming there friend. My only slight issue is that many points in rhymes and then all of a sudden it doesn't which can feel a little odd when reading it out loud. However I would still say it is a good book for your little kids."
2,Colossal mistake,My dogs are each about 75lbs and the one dog had this rope ripped to shreds in a matter of a couple of hours and in the garbage it went the day it arrived
1,POOR QUALITY,I LOVE THE MOVIE VERY MUCH BUT THE QUALITY OF THIS VIDEO IS VERY BAD.... I HOPE THEY WILL HAVE THIS ON BLU RAY
3,Ok General Overview,"I agree with what another reviewer said--where is Eleanor? In the chapters dealing with her marriage to Henry, which covers about one-third of the book (or more), there are several pages and even a whole chapter or two were Eleanor isn't even mentioned, the majority of that part of her life isn't about her, it's about her husband and sons. Which was rather disappointing seeing as how that was almost half her life. Other than her disappearance in a lot of places, the book is alright."
3,Where is Eleanor ?,"I expected to learn more about the person when I read ""this is a biography of Eleanor of Aquitaine."" Although Eleanor is mentioned in every chapter,this is a history of Henry II and his conquests in war and lust. Eleanor and her children become peripheral characters in the tale of Henry,Beckett,Louis,Rosamund, and war,battles and conquest.In this book, Eleanor of Aquitaine is lost among the far too many other characters. Ms. Weir writes well researched and utterly dull history books. The kind of reading required in high school and responsible for so many students losing interest in medieval history.I am plodding through her books because I enjoy English history and in between the page after page of detail, I occasionally find an interesting fact."
5,Inspiring and exciting true story told by a compelling writer,"This book is incredible. I have read several books and articles about Eleanor of Aquitaine, and this book is the most well-written and interesting of them. I think Weir tried to make the work more accessible than previous works, and she succeeded. Yet the scholarship is still impeccable. Like other reviewers, I was introduced to Eleanor through Kate Hepburn's portrayal in the movie A Lion in Winter. That set high expectations for the real person as well as the character of Eleanor. Weir does not disappoint even then. Weir's book was one inspiration for my first novel."
3,Informative in a roundabout way,"By reading the other reviews I thought that was going to be a very interesting book about an interesting woman in history; however, I am about half way through and am a little disappointed because there seems to be little talk about Eleanor and more about the surroundings and her husbands. Understandably if there is little information there is not much that you can say, but I would be more interested if it presupposed a little bit more and not cited so many other sources. I guess I wish it would have read more like a story instead of an academic book."
4,Interesting book.,"I'm not a history buff and I knew nothing about Eleanor of Aquitaine before reading this and am glad I purchased the book. It was very interesting and I feel I learned a great deal about not just her, but the politics of that time."
3,Colorful and lively. But where's Eleanor?,"Alison Weir doesn't disappoint with another lively, colorful biography. It's a refreshing human portrait of a complicated and not always likeable woman who was neither the Rosamund-murdering shrew nor the romantic bare-breasted Amazon Crusader of myth. It's a shame that Weir had so little information in the contemporary chronicles to go on, and the book suffers from it. Eleanor disappears for great gaps in the historical record, and as a result, Weir must pad the book with the minutiae of medieval life and the political wranglings of her husbands: so much so that the book often reads like a bio of Henry II. Still, it's highly readable and told with Weir's usual verve."
3,Well written but a little light on Eleanor,"This was a very well written book about the early Angevin family, with Eleanor of Aquitaine as perhaps the common thread uniting Henry II, Richard and John. To call it a biography of Eleanor of Aquitaine is inaccurate: she is absent (or only speculated about) for large portions of the book. I'd recommend it for anyone interested in European history."
2,Alison Weir has never met a fact she didn't like,"So much so that she crams every single one of them into this book without the editing that one expects from a serious historian and/or author. As a result, the reader is bombarded with a barrage of trivia which serve to obscure the truly relevant facts.As Ms. Weir points out early in the book, Eleanor lived in an age of illiteracy, so there are relatively few written sources to rely upon. Fair enough, so say that and try to write a coherent narrative based upon the relevant available facts. Don't just empty a dump truck of facts, leaving it to the reader to determine what's relevant.Oddly enough, there are some chapters, generally those relating to the society of the time, that are very well written. But they are not the key chapters.Since writing the foregoing, I have discovered that Ms. Weir subsequently wrote an historical novel about EleanorCaptive Queen: A Novel of Eleanor of Aquitainethat received scathing reviews from amazon readers."
2,Not much about Eleanor,"While I know there's not much surviving info out there about Eleanor specifically, this mostly details the history that surrounded her during the era, and the goings-on of her husbands. Not much about Eleanor herself. I like Weir's books, and trust her research, but this one was hard to get through, with mundane details and not much life."
3,Interesting but limited,"I enjoyed this immensely, despite the very little information actually provided about Eleanor. I am conscious of the fact that very little information is available about her life, and what is available is mostly from a male perspective, or something along the lines of ""and Eleanor the King's Wife was also there"", but I do still think that there should have been more of a focus on what she could have been doing whilst husband X and Y were busy reigning. Still, an enjoyable part of Alison Weir's extensive work."
3,Who is Eleanor?,"It was disappointing, after having invested myself in Alison Weir's Eleanor of Aquitaine, not to have a better feel for who the queen was. Unlike Ms Weir's other books, Life of Elizabeth I, War of the Roses, and The Children of Henry VIII which vividly brough to life the main characters and period, Eleanor seemed to be missing. After having read several historic novels about her I was anticipating finding out the 'real' story. I now know that I know less about Eleanor than when I read the book ;)"
2,If you want a textbook style book this is for you,"I read 32 pages of this book on what should be an exciting topic and was bored to the point that I counted the number of pages listing references and stuff (just shy of 100). When it takes five days to read 32 pages, it is a sign that there's a problem. It's a text book style where the subject is lost among tons of facts that are repeated and referenced rather than stating them and moving on. I found another book on the the same subject that flows and moves and keeps my interest and is literally a page turner. It is Queen Eleanor: Independent Spirit of the Medieval World by Polly Schoyer Brooks. It's more of novel than boring facts with an academic vocabulary. In 7 pages, I've found out more and care more about the people being written about than in Weirs tome. I don't HATE Weirs book, but will steer clear of any others written by her. Thirtytwo pages was more than enough."
3,Not Her Best Book,"I usually enjoy Alison Weir's books, and find them an interesting and relaxing read. Not so this one. I had to force myself to finish this, and I'm a little disappointed by some factual errors I've run across. It is one of those books that you have to make yourself read because it is so plodding."
2,Boring book of most fascinating woman ever,"Ever since I read ""A Proud Taste for Scarlet and Miniver"" when I was about 11, Eleanor of Aquitaine has been my most favoritest historical figure. So I was intrigued when I heard about this book. But it was the MOST BORING history book I have read. I don't know how Allison Weir managed to write such a boring book about such a fascinating person, but she did. I realize that there is not much historical documentation about Eleanor, but this book did nothing for me. What a disappointment!"
4,A Great Overview of Medieval Europe,"Alison Weir has the ability to bring the Angevin Empire of the Plantagenets alive to those readers who have no foundation in Medieval European history! That is truly a remarkable feat when you think about it. History should be approachable. Even though I am fortunate enough to have a BA in History, I am grateful to writers like Weir who use a style that is so enjoyable. I hope that folks who think history dry and boring happen upon Weirs treatments somewhere along the line. They'll be pleasantly surprised!"
5,What a book!,"This is not an easy read, but something that is well worth the effort! Parts of the text have changed my life already. I highly recommend this book for anyone wishing to draw closer to our Lord."
3,Okay,"Quality of these items is very high, but in the end I find wooden food a bit static, for lack of a better term. I purchased these mainly as a starter play food kit - it was one of the few that included meat in addition to the fruit & veggies. In the end my toddler and I have been happier with the fabric foods like Haba's Biofino brand. I guess it's a subjective choice."
5,lots of food for the $$,"A whole lot of food for the $$, I couldn't beleive how many pieces are in this set. Nice enough quality. My 18-month-old daughter isn't so into them, she cooks her regular old blocks more than these right now but they're a nice starter play food set and she'll grow into them. I think they make a great gift along with the M&D wooden cookware set."
3,paint comes off!,"wow, i got this for my almost-2-yr-old.just now, she was licking it for a few minutes and the paint came off!!MADE IN CHINA i would guess!? the paint better NOT have any lead in it!!!"
2,Food Group Let Down,Purchased this product for my 3 year old daughter b/c I thought it would be a fun way to introduce the idea of food groups to her. She absolutely loves it and it is a great accompaniment to her Waldorf inspired all natural wood kitchen. The product however is not very durable and seems to be destroying very easily. We were a little disappointed when one of the crates broke and the paint began to chip off the food items within the first 3 weeks of receiving.
2,Paint Chips Off!,"I got this set for my son for Christmas and by January half of the food was chipped. It chips off a little every time he plays with it. It's play FOOD, of all the painted wooden toys play food should not chip! It's really too bad because they're so cute."
2,"Nice toy, poor quality","We purchased this set for my two-year old daughter last Christmas. She loves it. However, we've had to throw out roughly half the food as the paint started flaking off after about six months of use."
2,Should have purchased plastic,"This set does not live up to the Melissa and Doug name. I bought this set for his second birthday along with the step 2 kitchen. My son likes to 'mouth', still even at 3, and pretend play with these wooden food pieces. The paint chipped off each piece and so I've had to throw most of the set in the trash. Maybe this is common with wooden toy food, but if so then maybe it should say so on the packaging."
3,Small pieces...,"I purchased this play food for my son who is 18 months old. I guess it's probably my fault for not reading more about the actual sizes of the pieces. I just took out the pieces I felt were too small for my son right now. Aside from the small pieces, it is all actually really cute. I do feel like plastic play food might be a better deal. This is probably the only Melissa and Doug product I have ever gotten that I feel was not up to my liking."
2,These don't look like real food!,"I bought this because I wanted a safer product than plastic food. Well, the problem is that most of this food you cannot even tell what kind of food it is. The detail is almost non-existent. The most identifiable food is the banana and even that isn't great. I am disappointed in these because I feel like my 18 month old can't identify most of the items. (I even struggle trying to figure some of them out!) I also wished they included foods more common to a child . . . like instead of a tomato (how many kids eat tomatoes) there should be an APPLE! Anyway, I think these are poorly designed and poorly executed. WASTE of my money. I went off and bought the plastic more realistic looking food instead. One last thing, I hate that these are made in China . . . I just don't trust the toxicity of the paint used."
4,My girls love it,Excellent product. My girls love it. Each piece is so real. The dog mistakenly tried to chew one piece. This is a great educational toy for your little angel
4,perfect for small hands,"I bought this set for my 2-year-old daughter for Christmas along with an Educo kitchen and Educo cookware set. The food is not life size but it is perfect for small hands and for the small cookware that she has with her kitchen. The pieces are relatively heavy nad appear to be good quality. Not great quality, however. I have already noticed at least one piece that has been stained with paint from another piece. I read the reviews and expect some paint chipping as time goes on. That is my only problem with this set. But I believe that for the price, the pieces are very nice."
4,Cute food,I bought this food set after seeing it at a friends house to go with our new kidcraft kitchen. I really like it. So do the kids. The only one I really don't understand is the orange. It just looks like an orange ball. It would be nice if it had a little dimple or a green stem painted on it. Like another reviewer my kid just likes to throw it like a ball. We took that one away.
2,disappointing and broken,"The wooden food was sturdy enough but the crates that they were in were all broken. This is what divided them into ""food groups"" We did glue all back together but was very cheap and thin wood."
1,"Nice idea, poor quality","My wife and I are very pro Montessori and felt that the wooden toy products were the way to go for our two toddlers. However, after having purchased a number of the M&D pieces, we were very disappointed to see the paint chipping off within only a couple weeks of our kids using them. For the cost, we expected these would survive at least a year of some wear and tear, but that won't be the case. Will look for another brand in the future that's worth more for our buck."
2,Small and Not Realistic,Just got it today and am unimpressed with how small and obviously fake the play food is. The pieces are unrealistically small. Doesn't come close to the other food that Melissa & Doug makes. Pretty disappointed. The fish is so small that I think it should have been thrown back into the river.
5,Melissa & Doug Food Groups,I bought this for my granddaughter to have in her play kitchen. It is educational teaching them the food groups as well as fun to play with! I would definitely recommend this.
4,Great toys,"These wooden foods are great quality and I can tell will last, got these to go along with my daughters play kitchen, arrived as expected and fast"
3,Surprised At Poor Quality,"I have always been a fan of Melissa and Doug products, believing that they are of higher quality than a lot of the plastic toys out there. However, I purchased the food group set for my daughter for Christmas 2010, and am shocked to see that in under a month, lots of the paint is chipping off. My daughter is 16 months old and tiny. She plays with these toys daily but she is not hard on them. Within a couple of weeks I noticed that the paint was chipping off of the egg. I thought maybe it was a fluke, but inspecting them again today, I've noticed several pieces with chips. I worry, because who wants their child ingesting paint? If it wasn't for the chipping, I would give this product 5 stars, but this problem may keep me from purchasing Melissa and Doug products in the future."
5,Great quality play food,"This is quality play food. It is just the right size - not too big to fit in most play pots and pans and not so small that it gets lost in the mess. My almost 3-year old daughter loves this set and plays with it all the time. It appears to be made of solid wood and is covered with a very durable and colorful coat of paint. I wish that all toys were made like this. The price was right, too - I got it on sale at 50% off."
4,Great value,"Great value, good mix of products, and great for kid play. Some items (orange, lemon) could be made to look more realistic."
3,Very nice,"I wanted good wooden pretend food (hate plastic toys) and I wanted a nice starter selection for a good price without having to buy, say, a separate veggie or fruit set. This is a basic food groups set so you get (4) little wooden crates filled with meats, veggies-n-fruits, dairy, and grains.That said, after receiving the product, I can confirm that buying separate sets would have yielded superior pretend food, but would have quadrupled the investment. Besides, the kids love it and engage in all the rich, imaginative and independent play parents love to peripherally watch while reading the newspaper or something.In summary,Pros:-All wood, nice all-in-one selection-Kids like it a lotCons:-Made in China-All the produce is smaller than life-size -- even the egg and lemon (whereas the individual sets include many life-size items)-Paint from some of the produce arrived scuffed onto other produce (enough to induce a mildly annoyed ""come-on"" but not enough to initiate a return or obsess over)"
5,Great!,"This set is great. I like the storage crates, it keeps things tidy after play is complete. Good value, good gift."
4,Good Mixture of Play Food,"We purchased this set of wooden play food for my 2 year old son for Christmas, since he was also getting a play kitchen. He seems to like these and they seem pretty durable, too."
4,we love this toy,"My 18 month old twins love ""cutting"" with the wooden knives. As fast as I can put the items back together, they are cutting them up. I bought the sandwich making set too so they could each have their own knife, and these toy sets are even more fun together. Keeps them busy, and comes with it's own storage container to keep all the pieces from getting lost. Love it."
4,Pretty good book.,"I took a long time to even pick up this book because I was biased. Also because I read the above review I just thought it was going to be awful. I was wrong. Jackie Callas is telling the story as SHE sees it. We have to remember that we'll never know the real truth behind the Callas family saga. Everyone (Evangelia, George, Jackie, Maria and of course all her associates and friends) has different views. The book is very easy reading and the only fault I found with it is that it moved really fast through their lives. One page Onassis marries Jacqueline Kennedy, two pages later he's dead. Oh well, maybe that's how Jackie saw it and he was insignificant in her life so why not pass through it quickly? Overall the book is not as terrible as I thought and if you love M. Callas read it if not anything but for kicks."
1,Poor lady wrote poor life view,"I bought this book somewhere in Thailand library years ago for shortening my long lasting travelling. At that time my English was so poor I could not understand most of the book so I let it rest at home for long years. I found it this January and as I love everything about Maria I have eventually read it through. But from the begining I felt the only reason for reading it was my English practising.I think the only Jackie`s problem was her absolute lack of aim in life. She had excuse for all her failure, she gave up a piano player career for unknown reason, it seemed as she had the only life plan - to get married.The editorial reviews from Publishers Weekly is completely right.Boring and poor reading."
1,Jealous sister wants her 15 minutes,"This book is an outragous display of blantant jealousy. The book has 3 parts - Sisters, The Sister (Maria), and Me (Jackie). But all 3 sections are filled with just as much self-gloating, self-pitying arrogance as the next. Jackie seemed to live out her dream of upstaging Maria Callas through her mother (since she was no longer alive to defend herself). I do not recommend this book, for it seems far too inaccurate and bias towards the fact that Jackie thought the world was prasing the wrong sister. It should have been been her up there."
4,Combination of Mana,"Something not too many people seem to have noticed is that this game is actually a remake of Final Fantasy Adventure, which was released years and years ago for the original Game Boy (which was also a ... of Mana title of sorts.) For this new remake Square Enix seems to have decided to combine FFA with Legend of Mana, a slightly confusing move since I was under the impression that Legend of Mana was not a very popular game. The result is fairly good, though the storyline's triteness displays its age, and the controls feel like they were made with the original Game Boy in mind. My biggest beef with the game was that it took me only 15 hours or so to complete (granted that I didn't find all the treasures or do all the intricate and frustrating side-quests.) That said, it was still fun."
1,A disappointing entry in the Mana series... skip it.,"Well, it's not Secret of Mana. It's not even Children of Mana. It's a totally different beast of a game. I tried on two separate occasions to get into this game, but one single thing turned me off: time actually passes during the day.Remember The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask? Remember how time passed during the day, and people might or might not be where they're supposed to be since they could be away from their house at that time? Yeah, I HATE that. And since Sword of Mana revolves around the same time based system, I HATE this game too.So in reality, I can't give you a true game review. I can only tell you that I couldn't even play it due to being utterly frustrated at having to walk back and forth through areas to wait for the time of day to change to get something done. If you can handle that, however, this may be the game for you.Not recommended for anyone. Epic fail."
1,played for 3 days and then got bored!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If i had to put this game into a few words then i would say: truley horrible.where do i start. well, the graphics are a little less then supbar. and the gameplay is just downright boring. This is mainly because the bad guys are stupid little blobs and bats. The whole game is one bad cliche after another. you can either be a gladiator (sword fighting is extremely frustrating because of air units and land units) or a girl that uses magic (magic particularly sucks because you have to summon a spell and then cast it and it seems to be not even worth the while because it does little damage and wastes huge magic points) I got bored after 2 days and would hugely not recommend it.graphics: 1fun factor: 0.5frustration: 5!!!!!!!!!!!!plot:0!!!!!!!!good for killing time (yes or no): heck no!!!!!cliche factor: 4worth your money? absolutely not"
2,Dissapointing,"This game was short and unsatisfying. The storyline and dialog attempted to become more and more ""philisophical"" as the game went on and became ridiculous by the end. The dynamics of the game were possibly even more flawed than the 1991 counterpart, which was in some ways more fun than this failure of a remake."
2,Way to overated insults good RPG fans everywhere.,This game is overated. The story is confusing. The characthers arn't introduced properly. The story will have you running around the same place for hours. You get killed to easy. The bosses are waaaaaaaaaaaay to easy. Half the stuff in the menus/items you don't even use. All the custimizable features arn't used that much. It's a long game but to easy. For the conclusion this game is not recommended for Good RPG players.
3,I remember when....,"My sister and I wanted this game so badly way back in 2004.You see, we were under the impression that this game was 2-player, that we could play it together. . . .We bought a link cable and everything, and in the end.... you can summon a friend to your screen with a whistle, but they have no control over their actions and it's really not very fun.We were so disappointed.This game still ended up being an interesting entry for the GBA, but it didn't see much playtime from me.My sister liked it more, however.It's an okay game.I like the Legend of Mana a lot more, but I'll give this entry in the series another try sometime.It's also worth noting that I first played this game (and sort of /only/ played this game) on the original GBA, and it was somewhat difficult to enjoy without a backlit screen. I might like it more now on my DS lite.Just saying."
1,...,"Ther'es one specifc reason I don't like this game. Once you get to the final dungeon (the game is kind of like the legend of zelda) it locks you out and you can never go back!! If there's ever a game without any replay value, no matter how good, I would never get it...That's why I'm always cautious when buying my games, unless, of course, it's a puzzle game, etc. not being able to play those again would be like locking you away from the game. The last thing I have to say about this game is I got my hopes up that it would be like paper mario the thousand year door (read my review) but instead it doesent save at all once you're done beating the game! You're still in that damn final DUNGEON!!! Sadly, I might give this game a good rating IF it had replay value...Get this game if you don't care about replay value... ):"
3,weak translation,"*Final Fantasy Adventure,* for the original Game Boy system, is one of my all time favorite video games, with a compelling story and characters and some gnarly monsters and tricky mazes. I was excited to see it had been updated for GBA, but the flashy graphics and pretty colors take away a lot of the charm of the original. The dialogue sequences are WAY too long, and really annoying. It's a fun game, but it makes me sad."
2,shoot the piano player!,"Who decided it would be a good idea to replace the classic ""Dragnet"" theme music with some horrible piano riff? This comes close to ruining this DVD for me. But thankfully Jack Webb and co. cannot be stopped by stupid video company that messes with classic TV shows. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD"
1,Do not buy,"Do not buy any digiview products...I bought 4 DVDs from them, and they all have the same sound problem. The sound is jumping and it makes them impossible to watch...Very dissapointing"
4,Must Own,"If you are searching for that singular classic sound from a compilation that oozes the artistic beauty that only Chopin can deliver, look no further. A must own. Brilliant."
2,Not as satisfied as I usually am by my purchase,"This item was advertised as new. It arrived in a scratched jewel case, and had all of the marks of being previously owned and used. I was disappointed by the quality of the item and the time it took to arrive."
1,Not The Same Weird Science as first one.,It says on the box that the original music is included but after watching they changed and added music. I didn't like it and i would recommend buy the VHS version not any of the redone ones.
3,"Love the movie, but the soundtrack is mucked up","Who's the cheapskate at Universal Pictures/MCA who wouldn't shell out for the soundtrack music of the John Hughes movies of the 80s? SIXTEEN CANDLES is missing lots of tracks (including David Bowie's ""Young Americans"" and the Sinatra version of ""New York, New York""), and WEIRD SCIENCE suffers the excisions of Roy Orbison's ""Pretty Woman"" as well as ""Gonna Fly Now (Theme from ""Rocky"")."" Since Hughes usually selected these songs for the sake of humor, their absence (both are substituted with yet another reprise of Oingo Boingo's nifty theme song) is annoying.That aside, however, WEIRD SCIENCE is an underrated little gem. It has its share of silliness, but there are many memorable lines, and it's arguably Anthony Michael Hall's finest hour as an adolescent schtick-master.Maltin may not get this movie, but look up Roger Ebert's review on the web, he's one of this flick's few defenders. And once you see it, perhaps you will be too."
1,The movie skips,I bought the movie as a gift for my husband. We just tried to watch it a few days ago and the movie skips. We tried to skip it forward and it still didn't work. :(
2,Weird movie,"This is a 1980s classic in the sense that it is filled with high school stereotypes, geeky old school computers, and corny jokes.Weird Science (High School Reunion Collection)is fun to watch, but is somewhat lackluster as a movie. While Kelly LeBrock was great, the rest of the actors were only passable, at best. The movie doesn't even try to be realistic and goes way, way over the top (including turning somebody into a piece of turd, mutant motorcycle gangs, nuclear missiles in the living room ...). This movie is just an excuse to be goofy - nothing more, nothing less."
2,"eh, not as great as you think it is.","first let me start by saying, i own this movie. i hadn't seen it in years. YEARS. but i remembered it being so funny when i was younger. so i went and bought it. i must be getting older, though, because this movie is just not as great as i remembered. although, one of my favorite lines of all time is, ""i don't know what the hell you're talking about and i wish you'd shut up."" now that is classic."
4,The Dreams Of Geeky Teenage Boys!,I saw this as a child and then again as an adult. I think I enjoyed it more as an adult. It is an amusing story of two teenage boys. This is another cheesy 80s movie that I watch over and over again because it is entertaining. It is potentially better than anything released in recent years. The story line is more possible today than it was back then. I will be interested to see how the story line holds up when this is actually possible.
4,"What Can I Say? She Likes Malakas, Dino!","At last, at last!!! Why did it take so long to reissue this gem?!! Just bursting with great lines all the way through, this is a first rate comedy from John Hughes...and Kelly Le Brock in the role she was born to play. I haven't bought it yet (probably will today!), and I don't give a fig about the lack of extras; I just want to relive those great moments in this completely unrealistic geek fantasy film:""The next thing you know you'll be wearing a bra on your head.""""How 'bout a nice, greasy pork sandwich served in a dirty ashtray?""""MA! I NEVER toss off!!!""""Don't threaten ME, Al! YOU'RE out of shape, I'll kick your ARSE!""""You can't go around hitting people with your Rex Harrison hat!""""So whaddya say I...butter your muffin?""Buy this. Right now."
3,Weird science and bizarre plot elements,"This is not as strong an 80s comedy as some of John Hughes' other work is, but it is all right for a brief comedic diversion. The acting is just okay, Kelly LeBrock is cute but not all that energetic, the music is mostly synth, and the wacko science that disrupts the household does not make a lot of sense, especially during the party scene, when a missile shows up along with some crazed bikers. These distract from the basic storyline.Otherwise, it is amusing enough for a cheap rental, but I would recommend Hughes' other work instead."
3,Odd,"Gary and Wyatt make a virtual girl on their computer, but they way they've set it up means she accidentally comes to life, along with some weird side effects around the house. She can get anything she wants for them, do anything they want for them, and so she does, showing them the sorts of things they'd only imagined, parties, popularity, bars, mutant street gangs, nuclear missles, girlfriends...It's pretty crude, and all over the place. I used to be a fan of the TV series, which was a little tighter than this film is too. I like the theme song though."
4,Weird Science or strange biology??,"2 guys named Gary and Wyatt aren't popular with chicks. They can only have dreams.....but do they really need dreams? They got a computer to create a woman. Her name is Lisa and she is the whole world to these guys. They believe it will solve all their problems, too....they will only find out."
3,Well-intentioned but not great,"The Bottom Line:One of those 80s teen films that was never really that good in the first place but people all pretend is a classic, Weird Science is a film designed for 12 year old boys (and I don't mean that pejoratively) who will no doubt find its wish-fulfillment-loaded plot interesting instead of rather juvenile; parts of the movie are cute and made me fondly remember the days where seeing the naked female form and impressing kids in school were numbers 1 and 2 on my priority list, but nostalgia aside the film is rather mediocre.2.5/4"
3,Don't fret !!!!!!!,This has got to be one of the funniest movies that came out in the 80s!! Even though the DVD is discontinued I was recently watching a talk show where Bill Paxton stated that he just layed down a commentary track for a special edition of Weird Science so let's all wait for what will have to be one of the best releases on DVD!!!!!
3,"Good Movie, but lousy DVD","I searched forever for this movie. After paying $30 to a lousy vendor, a vendor that took over 3 weeks to send my order, my patience was worn thin.No special features!When I see Weird Science on network TV at least they can show the cut scenes and enhanced soundtrack. This DVD didn't have neither.The important thing that matters is the reason I bought it.My VHS tape was worn out and I thought DVD could be the answer. This is a great movie and I had to have it after I threw out my tape.My advice to movie lovers, get the old movies quickly cause they are hard to find!"
5,loved it,i love watching it was a kid and now it is even better as an adult. haven't saw in years and still a great movie.
4,Fun adolscent romp,It was one of my children's favorite movies. It is somewhat juvenile in outlook but it is fun.
5,Greatest Guy Movie Ever,"What male wouldn't like to conjure up KELLY Le BROCK for love lessons! Nerd gets the girl, and bullying is repaid in a most interesting manner"
4,Enjoyable look back....,"Totally silly, of course. Still I enjoyed spending 90 minutes withthis mid 80s flashback. Working with computers, seeing theold technology was especially amusing.Some reviews have noted that later editions of this film havebeen edited. I thank those reviewers for pointing that out.The WS AC3 version may have no bells and whistles, but atleast it is true to the director's vision."
5,LOVED IT THEN! LOVE IT NOW!,"I was a big fan of this movie back when it first came out! It was my favorite! Now, I'm a mom, with a son who bears a striking resemblence to the behavior of Chet! It's about time HE sees this movie!It's full of good humor and fun for the young and young at heart. A classic in my book for sure. I still ask people, ""Did you spit in this?"" :o)"
3,"Ridiculous, but a classic for teens in the 80's","One of the most quoted of movies by anyone who came of age in the 80's, alongside another Hughes/Anthony Michael Hall classic, Sixteen Candles. This may be its only redeeming quality, but that's all it needs. Perhaps only surpassed in quotable lines by Caddyshack."
5,"Very classic, VERY sexy.",watch the pianist during the big party. she is playing the piano when suddely the fireplace becomes a vacuum and she grabs on to a bar only to have her clothing SUCKED OFF!
5,Rare Laserdiscs - dvds Movies Collector.,"Weird Science's one of my Favorite 80s movies,a very great movie,I enjoyed watchin' this movie,IF You're Anthony Michael Hall's Fan,give this movie a try :)"
2,Fav Film with Bad Letterbox,"I have been waiting for this movie to be released on dvd for a while and I am totally thrilled with it...well...maybe not totally. The letterbox is botched. I experienced this same problem with the second ""Back to the Future"" film and the studio offered a mail in replacement with the correct aspect ratio. To be more specific, the bottom portion of the film is cut off. I noticed this in the kitchen/omelette scene first. I then compared it to my vhs copy and sure enough, the bottom of the film is missing. I returned my copy and got another one and it also has the same problem. Anyway, I contacted Universal and am waiting to hear back if they have a solution for this. You might want to wait if you are as big a fan of this movie as I am. OTHER than that...it is an excellent transfer and still fun to watch (just wish i could see the whole thing)."
2,Not bad,"I enjoy watching the 80's movies. My husband bought Weird Science for me. He thought I would be excited to own this dvd, like I am with many other dvd movies. But I never felt crazy about this movie. I think Anthony Hall does a great job in a lot of the 80's movies, but this isn't one of them. He's done better acting."
2,Disappointed,"Though the dvd was in new and working order, I did not appreciate the fact that the case appeared rewrapped and clear plastic on dvd casing that contains the graphic movie art was deliberately cut."
1,Bonus MP3s EXPIRED!,"I purchased the movie with the impression I would get the 3 bonus MP3's, otherwise I would have purchased from another source. Only to find out that this offer expired 6 months ago. Buy this movie from someone else at a cheaper price."
5,Brennan,"I am a Bernard Knight fan so I may be a bit prejudiced. However, the story scenario is a possible one and it is interesting to see how Knight treats various characters and their unique personalties. My one regret is that there is some degree of ""God blaming"" which places philosophy above theology and that those with any Christian faith are not treated all that well. It is the problem of ""a good god wouldn't do that"" faulty logic argument or an argument to emotion. Despite that, it is an interesting read."
3,"Average for a Simak story, but excellent compared to others","I am giving this book 3 stars and not four, because CF himself has raised the bar very high with some his other books.Still, this is a great book with great insights about human nature at its zenith and nadir. There is only one problem: it takes a good part of the book for its main theme and essence to become apparent; but, once they kick in, watch out. It is high quality science fiction with mucles and brains.Do not let my giving the book 3 stars detter you."
4,Another great one by Simak,"This is a typically good Simak book; the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that he has many that are better. The ""parapsychological"" concept is also explored in his story ""A Choice of Gods""."
2,Too Many Problems,"We purchased washer and dryer four years ago. The Dryer has been problem free. The Washer has had a problem once a year. The latest problem is a bad spin bearing and replacing it costs more than a new washer. We had hoped to get more than four years use of the machine, GE work on your design and product quality."
4,"Like all West's Nutshells, you really can't go wrong","I purchased this book to give me a refresher to take a certification exam as a paralegal. It gave me all that and then some. I highly recommend this to any law school or paralegal school student who needs a good, thorough overview of the legal research process and resources."
5,Arguably The Best Classical Album Of All Time,"Gorgeous recording. Haunting and inspiring melodies. As compelling today as when I first heard it in the early 70's. A must have for fans of ""The Philadelphia Sound""."
5,Can a Christian Have a Demon,"Yes we can, BUT we need not let them inhabit as they are easily evicted from the house.Authority has been given to serve the eviction notice on them. !!!"
5,Everything I love,"It's difficult to explain this album without getting too gushy, but somehow, Manitoba brings to mind the last 2 Flaming Lips albums, ""8 Miles High"" by the Byrds, My Bloody Valentine, Spiritualized, Pet Sounds by the Beach Boys, early Mercury Rev, Aphex Twin, and Four Tet.All at the same time. That could easily be a recipe for disaster, but somehow and improbably, it all works. Give it a few listens - it takes a while to soak it all in but right now, this is my favorite album of the year."
4,An interesting creation,I was a little dissapointed to see manitoba move away from their soft-beat-melody style. There are a few great tracks on this album. -Crayon and -Jacknuggeted are my two favorites. I would definately recommend you buy -Come on break my heart- (Manitoba's previous album) first. It is one of my favorites and definately rates a 5++.
2,Minimal variation on the Stone Roses,"The people who have mentioned Aphex Twin and Four Tet have clearly never listened to either of these artists. If you liked the Stone Roses you will like this. It's not an 'electronic' album at all. I've ordered Manitoba's earlier cd after listening to the samples (the reason for purchasing both these albums) and I certainly hope it sounds nothing like 'Up in Flames'. It's funny, I promised myself I would never buy an album again without listening to it and yet it seems that samples on the net can be misleading, either that or Dan Snaith has had a serious identity crisis in the last few years!"
5,Just Beautiful Stuff Inside,"If you are trying to figure out what this music is, all I can say is that it is as close to essential that you will find. Rainer's music speaks volumes even when alone and quiet...When people ask what kind of music I like, I usually reply ""Soul Music""...and the next line is 'oh, like Aretha Franklin'...oh no..not that stuff...just music with tons of soul in it...that you can feel what they are playing or speaking about..That is Rainer music..pure soul and deep lengths of feelings....true and moving..so give it a turn and let him sing you something that will stick...his slide work is smooth and working its way to Duane's level....his own style, which is the true move of music of any worth.."
4,"Great, but...","Fits great, but How do I change the lens to the clear one. Can't figure it out. Can anyone help??? :P"
2,Just a wee bit small for my purpose,"Product appears to be well made. However, I wear glasses & I have a difficult time putting it on with my glasses. Consequently, after the 1st use, I've tossed it aside. My glasses frame is on the small side, so I can imagine that it will be very difficult for someone with a large frame. Once I got it on over the glasses, the fit was just tolerable. I know that I won't purchase this product again in the future. If I didn't wear glasses, I would have given it 4 stars."
2,"Check the ""copper"" with a magnet.","Beware,I bought one of these exact (I mean EXACT, same dimensions, same exact baked on finish, same Casa Percussion head) drums from a local vendor of hand drums here in Florida. The one I have is made of steel. Magnets stick right to the body,which would not happen with copper. The head popped because the little rim of the synthetic drum head was badly oxidized, so I had to remove the head. While I was doing this, I started wondering why this ""copper drum"" had so much more of ""coffee can"" style ring to it than my little cheapy aluminum one. Tonight I decided to put a magnet to it to double check.... Well, you know the result. I don't blame any of this on my local vendor because he probably bought the drum using the same information posted here and figured to be truly made of copper. If you're okay with steel and like the price, go for it, but if you want copper this is not the one for you."
4,More academic than practical,"""Photography: A Critical Introduction"" offers decent insight into some ideas and theories surrounding the new instrument of art, the camera. It should be noted that very few photos or examples are used in the book, and this absence definitely accounts for the book's partly dry flavor. ""Photography"" is probably less appropriate for hobbyists and more so for academics, but none the less remains a worthwhile read for those ready to sit down and study."
3,A highly academic book,"The other reviewers have hit the high points. This book is dry, lacks illustration, is academic and difficult to read. The writing style is highly academic with major points all but hidden in convoluted sentences. To complicate matters the chapters are written by different authors so the writing styles vary. There is much to be learned from this book but as the other reviewers have pointed out, it will be a painful process."
3,Be aware,"I bought this tool as part of a backup plan and have not been able to use it but I wanted to share some info... the tool has a fixed guide that must fit tightly inside the pipe you intend to remove. The inside dimensions of PVC pipe are not tightly controlled and do vary. I tried the tool on 3 pieces of 2"" pVC pipe that I happened to have. It would not fit into 2 of the 3 and thus would have been useless with those pieces. It is inexpensive and if you are lookin for this kind of tool you are probably desperate so it might be worth a try. There is a similiar tool that come with 3 replaceable guodes (for drain, sch 40, and sch 80) that costs more but probably has a better chance of success"
3,"Reasonably interesting stories, but over-romanticised","Sky Masterson is obviously in love with flying and all things related to it and it shows in his detailing of events and panoramas. But unfortunately the stories lack real aviation substance, and the potential for literary substance is let down by his writing that is often too flowery and weak in narrative.Never the less, many of the subjects of these articles/short stories are compelling.Just about ok reading - possibly a 'recommendation' for hard core aviation enthusiasts."
3,Less interesting than expected,"I was somewhat disappointed in this book, as it is something of a disconnected series of yarns with no discernable unifying theme other than aviation generally. Not what I had expected."
5,Soar above the rest,"I am not sure if you need to have the passion for flight embedded in your veins to fully engulf yourself in this mans words but I, who have that passion well in me, have found very few books that bring the reader into such a magnificent world in such a magnificent manner. I am at the beginning of the long road to an airliner, but this book takes your imagination and thoughts to where few men have had the privilege to go to. Expect to experience laughter, fear, a tear or two and above all, passion for flight!"
5,Come fly with Sky,"I loved reading this book and feel that Sky Masterson has really hit a winner with his first novel. He's an extremely talented writer with the ability to bring the reader into the cockpit through words. He enabled me to visualize, to feel and to hear the events as they were happening. His great love affair with flying is evident in every story.This book is a great read. With Masterson's talented use of words, this is just the beginning!"
2,Recaptures my youth,"Actually, I meant 5 stars, but I can't seem to edit it.My rating is very personal, because I love it because it's part of my past.I slice of the 80's that gets no play now, ""Heaven"" and ""Another Day in the Big World"" were the two songs that got some, but not much, airplay. The video for ""Heaven"" was also seen a little.Sure, it's interchangeable with many other 80's albums. Sure, it's kind of like an album Animotion could have made. But it's 80's purity is its charm. If you listened to songs with basic synthesizers at the time, this will take you back to a point where you'll even smell that mousse that was always in your hair. 80's musical historians, this is one to explore."
3,It's still pretty average,"Otaru, Hanagata, Lime, Cherry, and Bloodberry have all arrived in Xian for vacation. Otaru is poisoned by a extremist faction that is trying to take over the government. After finding a cure, the Marionettes disappear and Otaru is framed for trying to assassinate the Emperor. As a fugitive, Otaru and Hanagata must go on a quest to find the Marionettes. The bad thing is that they have lost their memories.Season 2nd isn't bad. The story is pretty good, and it's as fun as season 1. My complaints with this season are the terrible animation, and voice acting. Cherry is the only character that doesn't look deformed and have an awful voice actor. I was expecting way more. Especially since the OVA had such great animation. With a 5 star story and 1 star production quality, this anime is pretty darn average. I recommend renting or watching season 2 online instead of buying it. If you're not as disappointed as I am you may decide to buy it later."
3,Can only use for a short time,"My classroom is perpetually cold, even in the spring and last summer. I have used this heater off and on for two years and my number one problem with it is that it blows the fuses in my classroom.It heats what it needs to but must be turned off and on to rest for short periods of time.Natalie S."
1,not so hot,This heater worked great the first day then that was it. It is off more than on. Not worth the price or the effort. What a mistake!
3,this product is okay,"THIS HEATER IS MUCH SMALLER THAN IT APPEARS. ALTHOUGH IT IS SMALL, IT DOES THE JOB. THE HEAT BLOWS OUT AT FULL BLAST! THE NEAGATIVE WITH THIS HEATER IS THAT IT HAS NO OFF BUTTON. YOU CAN TURN IT ON BY TURNING THE KNOB AND THE HIGHER IT'S TURNED DETERMINES HOW OFTEN IT WILL GO ON AND OFF. IT CUTS ON AND OFF, BECAUSE IF IT DIDN'T THEN IT WOULD MAKE A ROOM EXTREMELY WARM. BUT OVERALL IT'S A NICE HEATER."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought FIVE of the Honeywell HZ-315 Quick Heat Ceramic Heaters at the beginning of the 2008-2009 winter season, from different merchants. (1 from amazon). Of the five, THREE are no longer working. One chugs on and off, and one never heated, right out of the box (the amazon one). The third worked for a few days and then just stopped. Don't waste your money on this model."
2,worst of the three...,i recently bought three heaters for 20 bucks a piece... this one was the worst of the three...as others have said... the thermostat doesn't work at all... all this heater is good for is heating a smallroom that was cold... after that it either runs for a few seconds or all the time... depending how far you turn the dial... there are better out there for the money...
4,AWESOME small heater!,"This heater is great! I use it to heat the area by my computer so I don't have to turn on the whole heating system for my loft, and it works great! It makes very little noise, has a handy temperature gauge, and doesn't blow a breaker with it and my computer on the same outlet! In fact I like it so much i'm buying a second one for my bathroom, which i'll put on a timer plug so the bathroom is warm when I wake up in the morning! The one downside to this product (why 4 stars instead of 5) is that for some reason, the designers forgot to include an on/off switch! it needs to be unplugged after every use!"
4,DANDY LITTLE HEATER,"Truly, a dandy little heater. The only negative comment is that there is no handle with which to move it."
2,ceramic heater,"it heats but there's not much way to regulate it, no thermostat or temp guide and compared to other ceramic heaters i own, it's a loser. Better to buy one slightly more expensive and be able to control it better. Also doesn't throw as much heat as I had expected without running at full blast and sucking down electricity."
1,disappointment,This item led me to believe it could be used in a bathroomOnly after i purchased item and called Honeywll was i told DO NOT USE INBATHROOM
2,Chose another brand,1. When I open the box. Found there is a loose screw in the heater.Meaning the product quality control has problem.2. There is no handle to hold the heater.3. There is no second heat temperature selection.
3,Powerful... Maybe too powerful for your outlet,"I read the product reviews and bought this because the majority of the customer ratings were 4-5's, with the biggest problem for people being the lack of an on/off switch. However, within 2 days of using this little heater I have blown my bathroom outlet (which won't reset for some reason) and then when I plugged it into a power strip and it tripped that as well. It works pretty good as far as giving off heat but, I must say, I am a little scared to plug it in again. I also live in an older house so purchase at your own risk:)"
2,Erratic heater,"This heater is unpredictable and works only 1/3 of the time. It was fine in the beginning, but the honeymoon lasted for less than 2 months. I would not recommend this heater."
1,Call the fire department!,"I bought my Honeywell heater to use in my office in the winter. It worked okay for the first season, but I had it plugged into a power strip and you had to keep checking the strip to make sure it wasn't getting too hot. Even so, one power strip started smoking and burned. A colleague borrowed the heater and plugged it directly into the wall, and later, smoke and sparks started to pour out of the outlet! The electrician said the entire outlet had melted and burned inside the wall. Needless to say, I have now thrown the heater away. I wouldn't recommend this product unless you live next door to the fire station."
1,This heater overheats?!,"This heater simply doesn't work. I bought this heater to keep me warm at work and while it ran fine for the first couple of months, lately, it will run for a short period of time and then it shuts itself off and doesn't come back on. I'm assuming the heating coil is overheating and it is doing so for safety reasons, but when the heater hasn't been running for that long (less than 5 minutes and at a relatively low heat setting), it shouldn't be happening at all. With all the choices out there, I would recommend finding something more reliable."
5,Greatest Little Heater!,"I have used this for a couple of seasons, and it is great! It is very small, but puts out a lot of heat for its size. Very convenient to take to different rooms as needed."
4,Little heater.,"The heater is much smaller than what I expected, but it really heat the room efficiently. And it has a good price which is easy to see. However, it causes a little bit noise and electricity unstable (1500W) while working."
3,Loud,"This small yet effective space heater does the job of heating a small room, but is loud. I don't know the reason for the poor design that ultimately results in such a loud appliance, but it is certainly annoying. This heater is probably not suited for use when trying to sleep; instead, use it while awake and while working in the basement or garage. I don't recommend this heater for a cozy environment, though it heats very well. Avoid this loud rattling clunker."
4,Nice little Heater,"I bought one of these heaters for work under my desk and it works nice, heats fast, right after you shut it off you can touch it and it doesn't get hot so it burns you, very safe. I bought 2 more of these heaters one for home and I gave one to my daughter to use in her apartment. I live in San Diego so it's a good heater for the winter and cooler days here. It is a little noisy when it's running I cannot hear it at work but I can hear it running at home when it's quiet at night time. For the money I like this heat, I gave it a 4 because it is a mite bit noisy and that just might bother someone other than myself, I'm so darn hard a hearing I'm ok with it. I got it running now at work and all I hear is Jimi Hendrix whaling on the guitar. Can't go wrong with this little heater I bought this last year and it's still pumping out the heat, it is good for a small space heater."
2,Works great until it quits,Worked great for a couple months. I use it in my office (10'x10')to take the morning chill out. But now it will run for a few minutes and then the internal thermostat or circuit breaker trips after a few minutes. It will not turn back on unless I unplug it and let it sit. I can hear and audible click and then I can plub it back in - for a few minutes and the process starts all over again. It is CLEAN too so no issues there. I hate things that only work for a short time.
1,Worked for ONE week,I ordered this heater in late January (got it in early February). This heater worked all of one week. I would not recommend it to anyone. It is throwing your money
1,Broke after 2 weeks,This heater stopped working after about 2 or 3 weeks of owning it. It was cheap but is a piece of junk.
2,Had it and returned it - serious design flaw,"Being so small and light-weight most times its undetected almost. The issue is the front grill and upon starting up, the heater very, very fast heats up and the grill is really, really hot. Consequently, I have had the following issues:a) My son (3 years old) suffered burns in calf (extreme red bruising) when he accidentally touched it.b) My guest had a small dog which cried for 2 hrs after the thing was switched off but fell on her furry backc) Although manual says xx in by yy in to be kept etc., etc. in reality not always possible. I had some small shreads of rug near the thing and detected burn smell.My advice is it's unsuitable for those who have considerable instances where toddlers/children/pets run around."
1,Not a good or even a safe product,The first time we used the space heater it lasted for maybe an hour before something blew and some sparks flew out and blackened the front of it. I would NEVER order this product again.
4,fast warming heater,"It's quick to heat up and heat is intense, perfect for small room/office. However, the temperature control doesn't work very well so it can get very hot and dry."
4,"Good, efficient heater, but a little noisy","I bought this heater for my office, which being in an old turn-of-the-century building tends to have a hard time staying warm in Winter. I've got a few Honeywell air purifiers at home working, so I stuck with this manufacturer for this purchase. I'm glad I did. PROS: it heats my office (10x15) quickly and maintains the desired temperature; controls are easy to use; it's small and easily placed out of the way. CONS: the fan is a little noisy; wish it came in black like most of the other appliances and items in my office. I'd recommend this little space heater for anyone with similiar needs."
5,Great little heater,I have owned this model in the past and they are great. I have used the newer model ones and this is better. I wouldn't buy anything else.
5,Great heater,"Good value for money spent. Works very well, happy with it. Not very noisy and puts a lot of heat"
3,"Great heater, but does not last long.","Heats up a cold bathroom quickly and enough so that when you get out of the shower, it's not freezing. Broke after 3-4 months. The thermostat works like it should. Great heater, but if it lasted 1+ year, it would be a perfect heater."
2,junk,"Once again, you get what you pay for. I'm here today to replace this little piece of junk, which I've tried to use to heat our bathroom for the past two winters. Closing the door to the bedroom and the walk-in closet doesn't help; this thing, after running for half an hour or so, can only add a few degrees to the temperature in the bathroom, which leaves us shivering despite the roaring of the heater. This thing might work to warm a closet or a small office; asking it to heat a room is a waste of time. Two thumbs down."
4,IBM N-Charge Adapter,The product works well with the battery pack. I did have an issue with the connector to the charger. Depending on the T40 or a 600 both IBM products the connectors were different. The total T40 worked perfectly.
5,This book was awesome!!!,"This book was awesome and definitely just as good as all the other ones in this series. I've read the first twelve so far, so I don't want to say anything that will give away anything for those of you who haven't read it, but I recommend the whole series!!!"
5,She's terrified to love........,"Nina won't tell that she is in love with Ben. That's true she won't tell until she is sure of Ben's love! But Nina has a shocking secret, which is why she has been so scared to love.It all starts when she finds out that her uncle is paying a visit. Nina is terrified, the memories of the last time she saw her uncle still haunts her.....and when people ask Nina won't tell what he did to her.That is, until she gets totally out of character and confesses her secret to her best friend Zoey. Zoey tells Ben and soon Nina finds herself confronting her uncle and her worst fears!Will Nina survive and will she be believed or is Nina's dreams going to haunt her for the rest of her life?Out of this series this is my fave book! It is excellent, Nina is a bright witty character but over emotional. The thought of being alone and facing rejection scares her.She's my fave character and she gets Ben, but it doesn't last forever and Nina's crushed!"
5,MAKING OUT is such a hot series!!!!!,"I've also read #1 and #2, and they are both excellent. You gotta start from #1, otherwise, you'll get totally mixed-up. My favorite character is Zoey, and I think she and Lucas are DEFINITELY meant to be together. I'm DEFINITELY gonna buy the other series in the series once they come out. Q.L."
5,What's Nina been hiding all these years?,"Nina's in love with her sister's ex-boyfriend. She can't tell anyone because she thinks he won't love her back. Also, when the past becomes reality, Nina has to face her abusive uncle and let her secret out. Nina is my absolute fave character in the series and her 'three-part comic tautology rule' is sooo cool! But underneath the witty exterior she's very sensitive and the most troubled of all the island kids. This is one of my most favourite books in the series because it deals with something really serious."
3,"Bad, ugly covers! Blech! Change them before I barf!!!",Okay this is kind of confusing don't you think? It's actually an OK book though. But I hate these new covers! Blech! All the people on these covers look like they're on drugs or something. I know I know never judge a book by the cover but I mean these covers stink man! I would give the book 5 stars if the cover was any better!
3,no-noise,"Ella is the greatest and this jsp set is wonderful, consisting of tracks from her long neglected Decca period. Unfortunately however the remastering is flat and muffled. Many of the tracks sound Cedar/No-Noised to death. Sure there's no surface noise but there's no sizzle either. Gone for instance are the growl of Louis's voice and soft shimmer of the drummer's brushes (which can be heard on some other releases). Five stars for the material, Two stars for the sound."
5,great band,"This is a very, very, good sounding band. If you have'nt had the pleasure of hearing them, do so. They have a real, real, crisp sound, and not over produced. If you like double drive, or korn, or stone sour, then you will like this one as well. so listen to the samples, it will give an idea of this cd sorta. I bought this the day it came out and I am not sorry that I did."
3,Its O.K. but not Slacker jesus...,"Thats pretty much the jist of it .Def not bad ,but at the same time not Slacker Jesus,which is a great album.In other wrds buy it but be careful what ur payin."
4,panasonic batteries,"I had been replacing my panasonic phone batteries w/ generic batteries from an electronics store and finding that after a couple of months, I had little to no battery life left. I ordered these batteries online and have been very happy with them, absolutely no battery life problems yet!"
4,no worries,"The replacement battery fits into the Panasonic handset without fuss. I let it charge up (unconnected) for eight hours, plugged the phone into the wall-jack, and all was well."
4,Phone's working again,I bought this to replace a low battery in one of my cordless phones. So far it's working great.
4,"So far, so good.","It's hard to review a product like this after receiving it because much of my opinion will be based on the test of time. However, it was sufficiently charged when I recieved it to use the handset, it fit into the battery chamber without any difficulty, and it appears to last for at least the time of my typical phone call (up to an hour and a half for conference calls) without losing a single bar. I've seen other batteries reviewed that did not easily fit the handset, if it fit at all without using a hammer, and others that needed several recharge cycles before reaching a usable capacity. So far, none of the negative for me, but as I said, only time will tell on this one."
3,no changer battery good,very good product I recommend it to everyone I came perfectly and has no sign of damage apart is very good product!
4,Better than the knock offs.,"I have discovered that these last longer than the Chinese Knock-offs if you don't pay too much. Amazon has the best deal on these, especially if you get the Super-Saver Shipping."
4,Good battery,"I bought this for my Panasonic KX 2730 model . It works as advertised and seems to be good. THough I just bought it a month back, cant really say about its life."
2,Battery petered out...,"This battery didn't last very long. I used to be able to get 3 days off the cradle; now, it seems after one night, I have to recharge."
5,A good book,I really liked this book. in fact I was looking for such a book that discusses mystics for my children. Mysticism is the ultimate form of religion where there is direct connection between the creation and its Creator. It helps one respect all religions.I would love to read more of such books.
4,Excellent Product,"It's easy to use and doesn't taste bad. Careful, it will stain just like grass or other intense greens will."
3,Trying stage...,"I got the Alcohol Free ChlorOxygen because a friend referred it, I am in the trying stage at the moment."
3,Undecided,"After 2 months of use, am still undecided. Maybe it's the application? We've hung in a cat-box closet in a tiny NYC apartment. Seemed to mitigate odors? But then, we've also been experimented with different litter formulations. Sorry, insufficient info so far."
4,Seven Days DVD,"Since your not going to find much on Poison DVD I say get it(If you love Poison). When I first watched the show I thought it sucked. The quality is low but over time you get use to it. I like CC and I'm glad he's been working on getting clean. You get to see the other side of him on Surreal Life and he is a cool guy but he is not on this DVD. Kotzen tried to fill CC's part but that didn't last long for many reasons. Richie is very good in this show but his ego is very apparent. I love Stand,Until you suffer and 7 days over you. Because of Kotzen and these songs I have ordered Native Tongue. Just got the 20 years of rock CD/DVD because I need more Poison on DVD. The new song American Band is good but I wish they had put Lay your body down on there too. That song rocks. Under $20.00 so get the DVD."
3,all the classics!... just a little dull,"If you were like me and were too young to see poison live, then of course you have dreamt of it! now maybe my expectations were too high but there were no crazy stage moves, and no spandex, which is what I had really wanted to see. and also a shocking lack of CC De'ville and the guy taking over is just a little weird and not charismatic.But on the upside... the songs were spot on Brett's voice is still amazing the chemistry is still there and they still rock they still make you wanna get up and dance or ones like ""every rose"" makes you wanna break down and cry..I have watched it 3 times already and taken to my dad's for him to enjoy also, so although not quite what I had expected it is still a high quality DVD that I am glad is in my collection."
1,Are you people DEAF???,"This sounds AWFUL. The sound is extremely distorted, the levels are all screwed up. It sounds like when your TV is turned up too loud and the sound just rattles, oHHHM!!!! But this sounds this way all the time. It is impossible to hear the guitars or Bret when he hits a high note. I know with Bret and his 1/3 octive range high note don't happen often. And who is that really fat guy on base...oh it it a very bloated Bobby Dahl. On the upside, Brets hairpiece never falls off, it never sweats either. It does not help that the song selection is heavy on the worst songs from an album that no one cares about."
4,Le hace falta 3 canciones... por eso 4 estrellas!!,"Por alguna razon, los discos españoles editados en los Estados Unidos siempre vienen incompletos. Este es el caso con ""Ciudades de Paso"" que la version Euro contiene 12 canciones mas un track escondido. Que paso con esas 3 canciones? Aunque esta version solo contiene 10 tracks, Mikel Erentxun parece estar en el auge de su carrera aunque el dueto con Beto Cuevas me parece que distorciono el disco. Habiendo tanto musico talentoso dentro España, la cancion hubiera sonado mucho mejor. Por ejemplo, con David Summers o un reencuentro con Diego Vasallo. Ponganle atencion a todo el disco, especialmente ""La respueta esta en el tiempo"" y ""Grandes Exitos"". Por cierto, Mikel Erentxun canta el eterno clasico de Hombres G ""Te Necesito"" en el disco tributo de esta gran agrupacion de los 80... ""Voy a Pasarmelo Bien"". Compren la version de DRO East West, porque como es de esperarse la version Warner Music Latina esta incompleta."
2,Decent Compilation - Not a Studio Album,"Don't be fooled with this one. This is not Strong Arm Steady's first studio release. Its a mixtape with songs from each of the artists that comprise Strong Arm Steady, X to tha Z - Xzibit, Phil da Agony, Krondon and Mitchy Slick. there are very few songs that actually have all the members of SAS rappin on it, with thier own verses. Still a good album, but i dont think it is a apt representation of what their finished, first studio album will be."
3,Making New Caind of Sounds,Start to do things that can be more productivity to the new way to find the exprecion of music.The voices are looking to have a melody and a personal sound that can make in the future things that can have more exprecion.For a star its a good work but they need to work more to have new sounds and not be a common way .. so there is a light for them.
2,Boring,"I had to read this for a terrorism class, and this was one of the most boring books I've had to read yet. I'm sure there is some good information in it somewhere, but because it was so boring, I couldn't stay awake to read that good information."
3,Required reading,I bought this book for a class in terrorism.It's a well made paperback.It was very informative.Many views on terrorism from different leaders in the field have been compiled.A great idea.But I feel the book is WAY too wordy.I literally had to read it with a dictionary in the other hand.Not bad for people who want to train for a spelling bee or learn new words to dazzle their friends but it really does add a lot of extra time to a reading assignment that you may not have.I would like to say I learned new words from the book but they are really obscure words I will never ever use in day to day conversation and will likely forget...actually I can't even remember them right now.
1,Bad Reflections,This handlebar mount mirror was most disappointing. The adjustable mirror shaft has next to no memory and creeps into a position which is totally unusable. Don't risk your safety or your dollars on this product. It's simply not worth the inexpensive price.
4,This game is really cool! I have it on my computer!,"This is a really cool game! I've played it on my computer! If you like bowling, then this is the game for you!The graphics are good too! I think they did a really good job on the computer one!Cya"
4,"Faded, but Not Forgotten","Faded Glory will appeal to aviation enthusiasts looking for pictures of airliners in schemes of the 1970s and 1980s. What makes this book worthwhile is that the author has included numerous pictures of small and obscure airlines, such as Simbair, Air Caribbean, and Arista International. Also noteworthy is that practically all of the airlines depicted have either folded or were merged with larger carriers. Had this book been published a few years later, I am sure Pan Am and Eastern would have been included as well.Most of the pictures are of decent quality, though a few do spread onto two pages. For each picture, Mr. Morton also includes an annotation of the history of the airline, though only basic information on the aircraft itself.All in all, as an airliner buff, I enjoy looking at the pictures and find the book to be highly worthwhile."
2,very spicy!,The packaging fooled me! I thought I was buying the mixed miso. It is convenient and edible but quite spicy!! Check the words on the package mixed or spicy!

5,Case of the Space Shuttle Mystery,I thought this was one of their best adventures The song: We're Gonna Leave Our Footprints on the Moon is one of my favorite.
4,Out of this world video!,"This adventure ain't my favorite Olsen-adventure video, but it's certainly among the best! The Trenchcoat Twins travel to Space Camp to figure out who or what makes holes in space shuttle Columbia! Cool video, based on actual events and guest-starring the 4th man on the moon!... oh, and the karate teacher Barney Blackbelt RULES!"

5,"I love Clinique Stay-True Makeup and have used it for 20 years, BUT at $199.50 a bottle that is highway robbery!","I have used Clinique Stay-Ture Makepu Oil Free Formula 03 Stay Beige for 20 years.BUT at $199.50 that is really taking advantage of customers! A couple of weeks ago I bought it at $22.00 a bottle on Amazon. Clinique has discontinued this product, so I hope no one buys it from you."
1,OUTDATED - NOT for anyone after the year 2005,"This book, has a lot of Information, however, It is not a wise choice for Pharmacy technicians planning on PASSING their Student Pharm Tech REquired Licensing exam after the year 2005.Material is outdated. Thanks"
4,float valve works well,"This is doing the job in my reservoir for a fountain/birdbath. Be aware that the flow rate is fairly low (it might be 1 GPM), but this was not a problem for me as I don't have to replenish much of the water once everything is full. A somewhat lightweight product, thus 4 stars."
4,Dr Browns WILL fit...,"I bought this sterilizer because it was significantly cheaper than the Avent brand, and should do the same job. I've used the Avent one many years ago, but am now using Dr Brown's bottles and worried that they wouldn't fit.I've been using the new sterilizer for a month now and am very happy with it. In response to previous reviewers' concerns:* Yes, there is a brown scum sometimes builds up, but like all appliances, it should be cleaned regularly and I think it says more about the quality of the water than the unit...I use boiled water to minimize build up.* The 8oz Dr Brown's bottle WILL fit with a little ingenuity. I don't use the top level but balance the teats etc on the bottle divider instead, and place the straws upside down in the middle bottle holder, caps on the lowest level. I sterilize less bottles so all the other bits & pieces will fit in - usually just do 4 bottles at a time."
1,Broke after a month,The sterilizer worked pretty well for about a month. Then (as others have also noted) the on/off switch stopped working. My guess is poor quality control.
3,mixed feelings,"As far as 'doing its job' goes, I find that the sterilizer is just fine. However, we are using the Dr. Brown's bottles and have found that the 8 oz. bottles are too tall for the unit! (A very frustrating situation). The 4 oz. bottles are just fine. When we sterilize a load containing the 8 oz bottles, we cannot use the top rack where you are supposed to place all of the other bottle parts. We have to just place the cover on and do the parts in a separate load. If the sterilizer was only about 1/4 inch taller there would be no problem at all.I've seen a few people writing about getting brown deposits on the hot plate.....As far as brown deposits go- this may be caused by iron in your water supply. You might want to check with your town if you have public drinking water to see what the iron content is. Could be coming from iron pipes/ water mains as well. Not a health hazard, just a NUISANCE!"
3,Wish I had read the reviews first,"I have to agree with the other parent, the Dr.Brown 8oz bottles don't fit. I can't return mine because I have had it for 2 months & can't find the box or instructions. Very poor design. I have to boil my 8oz bottles on the stove to sanitize. I may just go buy a differnt sterilizer after reading reviews on other brands. Wish I had read reviews before registering for this."
1,I hate it,I bought this sterilizer 5 months ago and past 2 weeks there has been a solid white layer of deposition which is making the water leak terribly. I end up getting my kitchen counter messy with water running in all corners. In turn I have to boil the bottles on gas. Whats the point of wasting so much money if it couldnt last for an year. I am terribly dissapointed :((
2,Great when it works!,I've had this item for about two months and it worked great. It's very simple to clean and operate. But it's only two months old and doesn't do anything anymore it just died.
1,Stopped working after 4 months,Especially for Baby Steam SterilizerTerrible quality. This stopped working after 4 months.
2,Novel needed more editing,"Davidson is definitely not a Jodie Thomas or Maggie Osborne. Pick up one of their novels instead if you'd like to read well-written American historicals. Davidson's dialog needs help. The characters' conversations were strange. They jump from subject to subject, read each other's minds, and never finish thoughts - very frustrating to read. The story drags on an extra 100 pages, not interesting enough to keep you wanting to go on. The idea of a wheel-chair bound hero was provocative, but his transformation wasn't done well. I lost interest in him half way through. Only read Redemption if you are completely out of reading material. In fact, reread an old Thomas or Osborne novel instead."
3,The Picture color is wrong,"I like the shoe style but when I recieved the shoes they were way green (sage) Not at all white and blue like the picture, very heavy also."
1,Not worth the money,"It doesn't land, it crashes. The wings are so thin they crack and about 4 days after Christmas, it has become a bad memory.Tower Hobbies sells almost the same thing for about $35.00 and looks to be a much better product."
3,hmmm,"i guess it's sorta coolcool turning, although the engine speed variating turning is not satisfactory, it flew well!"
5,Great Movie,"I would get so excited whenever Sixteen Candles came on cable. This is such a cool movie. I love the 80's and all of the big famous movies. Like Sixteen Candles, Breakfast Club, Pretty In Pink. I've never enjoyed a movie so much. At less not that I could remember. I am happy that I can now say I own all three of those movies."
4,If you grew up in the 80's you already know this movie,"Take yourself back a couple of decades by buying this movie. Who can resist the now innocent seeming depiction of high-school life in this movie. If only things were still as simple, then the world would be a better place :) For John and Joan Cusack lovers, its always fun to see them in their younger years as well. Nearly everyone else in these 80's high school movies has disappeared (though Anthony Michael Hall was in Caveman's Valentine), but that doesn't reduce their appeal.Buy it now, watch it at least once a year so you don't forget how much simpler things seemed ""back then."""
2,What happened to the music???,"Be careful when you buy this video. The soundtrack has been redubbed with different music! The story is still good, though I miss the Kajagoogoo song at the beginning."
3,This movie makes a lovely light!,"Sixteen Candles is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I love this movie. This movie is the shhh! If you haven't seen it, you must, because you are doing yourself a disservice if you don't see it. I think The Breakfast Club is better than this movie, but I still think that 16 Candles is still on top. Hey! I'm 16! It's the perfect age, and this is the perfect movie.I gave this movie 3 stars because the DVD ....... The picture quality ...... and the sound was horrible, but I loved the movie."
2,More like R than PG IMO.,"So I sat down to watch this with my son. It's PG after all. Well, like so many movies I watched when I was younger, I've forgotten how inappropriate (language, nudity, etc.) the movies could be. So we didn't get into this film more than a few minutes before the F-bomb was dropped and there was close-to-full nudity. My son was out of the room at the moment, so I was able to halt the showing.The point is that PG is a crap shoot. Don't assume that it's good for your pre-teens or teens to watch.It's a very funny movie, but not something for typical PG age groups.That's our sensibility for our kids."
2,Dont bother blowing these candles out,"Dont get me wrong this a good movie, but this movie is just to typical. I mean how unoriginal can you get. A girl looking for her love. She trys to find it in the most popular guy at school. Then what do you know, he calls her out of no where and bobs your uncle.The Movie is mostly about Molly Rigwalds sister getting married and everyone forgetting her birthday and some of the silly events that happen on her birthday and the day after.Molly Ringwald should have stuck to movies with the other brat pack members. Breakfast Club is undoubtably her best, and since she isn't the greatest actor I'm sorry to say this is her second best. She has so much potential, or I should say 'Had!'"
1,This movie wasted two hours of my life.,"I generally really like movies from the 80's, especially teen movies and I enjoyed other John Hughes films such as The Breakfast Club and Some Kind of Wonderful. But this piece of garbage was so cheesy, unfunny and pointless. The acting was terrible and I ended up having to fast forward bits of it so it would hurry up and finish. If you're the kind of person who finds stereotypical Asian characters funny and will laugh hysterically at the words Long Duk Dong, then buy this movie. If you actually have a brain, however, give this one a miss."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Yet another overrated teen comedy from the 80s (which people for some reason fetishize), Sixteen Candles has nothing really wrong with it aside from the fact that it's a not-particularly good movie which has acquired the reputation of a classic."
2,Some pretty off color teen stuff here,"In contrast toThe Breakfast Clubthis Molly Ringwald movie is pretty tasteless at times:1) one dollar to see her panties in the boy's bathroom2) sister getting high on muscle relaxants at her wedding3) house trashing seniors party4) sex with a drunken girl by a strangerAll in the name of humor I guess, but this is not a family movie.I really didn't like it and I usually do like good teen movies."
5,GREAT CLASSIC MOVIE,"An essential teen comedy. Funny, romantic, silly, and charming. The slapstick is never forced. A chick flick that can be enjoyed by anybody."
2,Where are the extras??,"Come on John Hughes. Yes, this is one of the best 80's movies, but give us some extras already!!! Commentary? Deleted scenes? Something??"
3,"Why does my VHS say ""PG"" and amazon say ""R""?","Truthfully this should probably be rated PG-13. Anyway, this is kind of your typical 80's teenage angst movie. The main character, Samantha, is your typical over-dramatic teenager. The guy she has a crush on, Jake, is a total babe. Michael Anthony Hall, the geek, is pretty hysterical. All in all a decent flick with some pretty good laughs. Joan and John Cusack provide some pretty random chuckles in one of their first films."
5,A Great Coming of Age Movie,This movie was great. I loved it! One of the best movies from the 80's!!
2,Great Movie But Ridiculous Price,"""16 Candles"" is a classic 80's teen movie. In the days before teen movies became formulaic gross-out clones of one another, this film invented more quotable lines than can be listed in a single review. The disappointing thing about this DVD, aside from the inexplicably high price, is the fact that it offers no extras whatsoever, unless you count widescreen. I would pay more for this DVD than many films out there simply because I consider it a classic, but without even a couple of interviews thrown in (how hard would it be to get The Donger to sit down for fifteen minutes?), I wouldn't front the cash for this one."
1,Sixteen Candles,I really love this movie and ordered but I have not yet received this item. I have been waiting for several weeks.
5,16 Candles revisited,This movie is still as good if not better when it first premiered. It brings back fun memories of being 16 all over again. John Hughes has a knack for capturing the angst of young people. I will always be a big fan of his movies. Molly Ringwald is perfect in the role of Sam and Anthony Michael Hall as the geek. Great movie!! Two Thumbs Up!!
3,"Great movie, disappointing DVD....","This wonderful comedy is as much a slice of the 1980s as ""Saturday Night Fever"" is of the 1970s. It is still laugh-out-loud funny, especially for those of us who lived through that time period. Unfortunately, the DVD offers no special features that could really enhance the experience. A scene selection menu is hardly worth it! What about some of the music videos from the soundtrack or a commentary track from someone involved in the production? What a waste! Plus, there is also an inescapable commercial stuck on to the beginning, which stinks!"
3,Disappointing DVD version of Funny Flick,"After countless viewings, this John Hughes modern classic is still laugh-out-loud hilarious. It's also a great time capsule for the styles of the 1980s. Unfortunately, the producers of the DVD version didn't capitalize on any of that and the almost non-existent Special Features are a serious disappointment. At least you will enjoy seeing the movie uncut!"
1,What happened to the soundtrack?!!,"This is one of my all time favorite movies, and I bought this video because my old copy had worn out. After watching 10 minutes of the new copy, I felt physically ill. The entire soundtrack's been changed! No ""Love of the Common People"", no ""Happy Birthday"". I couldn't watch any further. Some moron has butchered this film, and I'd return this copy if I could. If you've never seen the original version of this film then go ahead and buy it because the actual film is great and you won't notice the difference in the music. But to anyone who has seen it before, find an original copy. Watching this version will make you sick."
2,DVD's Music is not the same...,"During the 80s, many of us had seen this movie about a hundred times. Either on cable or renting it. So we KNOW the music, we know which songs come when.Unfortunately this DVD does not have the same music..some of it has even been removed entirely (like the scene where everyone is getting into their cars to get to the wedding).Until a special edition comes out with all the original music, I'd definitely skip this one!"
2,"Unbelieveably, the VHS version is better!","Boy, did Universal Home Video drop the ball on this one...""Sixteen Candles"" may not be the most disappointing DVD release ever (that would be, hands down, National Lampoon's Vacation) but it's close! The only thing that saves it is the widescreen format. What's up with the mono soundtrack? It sounds like it's coming from a 1950 am radio! Even the VHS version was mastered in stereo. And c'mon, there must have been some deleted scenes or extra footage they could've thrown into the mix!Of course, this excellent '80s teen comedy stands up very well on its own, but it's still insulting that it gets such shoddy treatment. Even Universal's similarly no-frills ""Weird Science"" DVD was at least mastered in surround sound.Unless you're a complete nut for the film, I recommend you wait for the inevitable special edition to come out. In the meantime, turn on your TV...it's on cable constantly!"
3,movie ratings,"Great movie, very funny but when it was out in theaters it was rated R now it is rented with a pg13 rating. I was unaware pg13 ratings allowed a fully nude women to be seen from the front. Seems they should keep the r rating."
4,Ah the 80's,Fun movie. If you loved the 80's you'll probably really like this show. I wish the guy she ends up with was a little more intelligent though. Some really funny moments in the movie that had me laughing. And the music... well I like a lot of 80's music so that kind of goes without saying.
3,A Rememberable Teen Flick.,"This is definately the rebound film. It is hard to live up to a movie like The Breakfast Club. This film is your average, average, teen movie. It does boost some new things to the screen, but it is mostly predictable, however, it is enjoyable. It has enough great moments to outweigh the cheesy parts, which makes it good in my book. If you are in the mood for a ""no surprise"" movie, this is the film for you. I reccomend it."
2,5 stars if tape quality was better!,"I love this movie and if it was soley on the movie this would get 5+ stars, but after watching this only three times my tape is crappy and the sound sucks. It's not my VCR either because all other tapes are fine. I hope that the DVD version comes back as I'd like to have a better quality version of this great 80's film that can make me laughe when I need it."
1,Don't expect to get your movie,I am still waiting for my movie. I have emailed the seller and have gotten nothing back. Don't use them.
1,Movie review,"The movie contains an inappropriate language. Too many filthy and dirty words.If the Hollywood had skipped those bad words, it would have been a good movie."
3,Sixteen Candles: Nostalgic Comedy,"Sixteen Candles is kind of cheesy, but in a good way. What is a girl to do when she can't seem to catch the eye of her true love, has parents that forget her birthday and a sister that is completely self-absorbed? The plot line exaggerates the strifes of the teenage years in a way that is extremely funny. I enjoyed the film mostly for its nostalgia and humor. If you're a fan of the brat pack and 80's teenaged comedy, this is one film you won't want to miss. It's not one of my favorites, but it was certainly worth a viewing."
4,Very Enjoyable,"I really enjoyed this movie. At first I was reluctant to watch it, generally disliking teen movies, but then I remembered it was an 80's film. For some reason, though 'Sixteen Candels' is pretty crude, it doesn't seem to be as blatant or unrealistic as the modern day teen-flicks.The story is about a girl, Samantha (not Sam), who has her ""sweet"" sixteen. Unfortunately, not even her visiting Grandparents remember it, her crush seems to be completely unaware of her, and all she can console herself with is some freeky freshmen who thinks he is God's gift to women. (Frighteningly, I know a few guys just like that kid.)The acting and everything is fine, but I didn't really think too much about it. I just watched the movie."
3,Buy..... Only to See MOLLY RINGWALD,"They really did a substandard job of transferring this terrific movie to DVD. I couldn't believe this was done by professionals. The picure is oversaturated with color & the sound is awful. The only reason to buy it is to see the delightful teenage MOLLY RINGWALD. I say buy the VHS version at Best Buy...it's about the same quality.I used to own the LaserDisc version & it was by far superior. Sorry I disposed of most of my LaserDiscs. I sure hope someone reissues a serious DVD of ""Sixteen Candles"". I'd buy it."
4,We Forgot Your Birthday!,"My sister got me this movie for my sixteenth birthday. She knows how much I love actress Molly Ringwald and all eighties movies. It was perfect because that year my mom forgot my birthday, which is how the movie starts... and then continues, creating the worst sixteenth birthday that a girl could imagine. It reminded me of how bad my birthday could have been."
3,Do children in large families get ignored?,"With Molly Ringwald's first major film role proving such a success, it's plain to see why John Hughes used her so extensively in the next few years. Anthony Hall plays a more interesting variation of the caricature geek who so often populate these teenage movies. It's clear why Hughes asked him back to play a similar role in he Breakfast Club the following year. There are quite a few similarities with the family in Home Alone, with the large family having more than two children, and so ignoring the star of the film. There's some enjoyable moments - the geek getting the girl in a Rolls Royce Convertible (which is as vulgar as it sounds), and Ringwald's character's realisation of which guy she _really_ loves. A top pop soundtrack complements the action perfectly."
3,I've actually never seen it....,"I ordered this movie for a relative, yet I've never seen it. When I was growing up, I saw parts of it, but never completely through. I still have yet to see the whole thing. I've heard everybody who has seen this movie loves it. Anybody growing up in the late eighties and early nineties and who loves cult-classics or whether or not you've seen it, has to own or have seen most John Hughes movies."
2,Should Be Rated R,"Like most thirty-something females, this film is a cult classic - Or should I say was. This particular DVD release is not the same edit they released in the theaters or to TV. Beware, within the first 15 min, you hear an f-bomb, s-bomb, a few other mild swears, and frontal female nudity for more than a few seconds. I only wish we would have known this before we'd hyped it up to our 12 and 13 year old daughter and son for family movie night...A little embarrassed to say the least. As read in previous reviews, most of the music that became popular with the film originally, got canned due to outrageous licensing fees on this version and is not present on this product. Steer clear. Look for the Theatrical release, if one exists. Shame on Universal for squeaking this one by. Consumers remember things like this."
1,Sixteen candles,"DVD was so scratched up....couldn't watch it. I tried to clean it, but the DVD would not play the entire way through"
4,My absolute favorite teen movie,"This was John Hughes at his best. ""Sixteen Candles"" is a classic teen movie and it set the precedent for numerous imitators and copy-kats. Yet, this movie is absolutely untouchable. I don't think I know anyone who hasn't seen it and doesn't love it. I highly recommend this movie as a must for your collection. I would have given it 5 stars because the movie in itself is excellent, but I was highly disappointed with the quality of the DVD. There aren't any special features and the sound is horrible. I would have liked to see an interview with the cast and the director. Maybe a couple of deleted scenes. Something! I don't even think there was a trailer. I was also disappointed because there is another version of the movie made for the numerous runs on television. There aren't any huge glaring differences, but there are a few additional scenes. I hope they eventually put out special editions of all the Hughes teen classics."
1,some music rescored! -(original music not in this copy),"ripoff-- score helped make the movie-- the original soundtrack not on copy i purchased and the rescored music stupid-- initial school scene- going to the church in cars, one ex., and beware it makes a difference--and audio bad and some addit. dialogue added,i think- !buy a used copy! with the original soundtrack-- i got ripped off, very disappointed! -- says on box rescored! it should be noted when reviewing movie at site!"
3,Still pretty good,"This movie has some politically-incorrect jokes based on nationalities and sexual preference - but I'm not politically correct and don't care.Molly's character Samantha turns 16 and her family does not remember it because they are busy with her sister's impending wedding. The sister gets zonked on Midol or equivalent before and during the wedding.Anthony Michael Hall is perhaps the funniest character, and because he is basically the same in all his films, this was probably his best role.A few notable small parts for John and Joan Cusak, and Jamie Gertz.Apparently an earlier DVD release had music, sound and picture-quality issues, but this one boasts having the original music mix, and sounded and looked fine.Odd thing is that Amazon has it rated as ""R"", while the cover and opening of the movie have it as ""PG"". There is a fair amount of four-letter words, body-part references, and a bit of shower nudity.No extras to speak of, so you are buying it for the movie only."
4,Great movie - BAD DVD,"This was a fun movie. It does not take itself seriously and pokes fun at its characters. Some of the pokig fun is not politically correct (to wit - Long Duk Dong, and some of the BoHunk comments)) but that was a bit of the 80's.This DVD has the original soundtrack, previously unavailable on VHS or the old DVD, and it still holds up.THE BAD PARTWhere to start - the packaging is cheap cheap CHEAP! They did not even put in a little card to tell you the chapter names. There is no commentary, no extras, NOTHING!PLUS when you put it in, it goes through ads for other movies and DISABLES THE MENU BUTTON!Again, this is a fun, 80's movie, but the DVD is so cheap and so obnoxious to the fans/owners that I hate to recommend it becuse the people who put it together were such jerks.But I do recommend it. Enjoy."
2,High School Reunion Collection,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE QUALITY OF THESE 5 STARFILMS!!!I'm a HUGE fan of John Hughes. Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club and Wierd Science are totally essential forany 80's Teen Film fan. Here are my gripes about these releases. First the picture quality is grainy and fuzzy onSixteen Candles and not much better on the others.Next the sound is horrible! DTS? How could they considerthis to be 5.1 surround when I didn't hear a peep out ofmy back speakers? I thought I would be hearing the brilliantNew Wave soundtrack in DTS surround. It's not! I thought the DTS logo on the back of the box assured a degree of quality. I'll certainly be careful on my next purchases. LastlyThere were no inserts in the box. I don't need a booklet, buta chapter listing would've been nice. I wonder how John Hughes feels about these crappy re-issues? Ugh!"
4,A blast from the past,I ordered this movie for a girls' night in. Sixteen Candles definitely represents an era of teen angst that many can relate to.
5,Timeless,Cannot get any better than the last song in the movie when he pulls up in his red sports car and they make eye contact!
3,Love this movie,"I was so excited to own this movie, not easy to find in local stores. Couple disappoints, first time watching movie, brand new out of wrapping and it has a scratch. Next, it comes with a sticker saying digital copy included but no code to download digital copy. Digital copy code missing."
5,Sixteen Candles,Awesome movie my teen daughter and I enjoyed it. Definitely brings the 80's in your home.
5,A CLASSIC 80S MOVIE,"I think i have seen this movie about fifty times now. It is one of the best comedies from the 80s, and reminds me of my own high school days. I totatlly identify with samantha baker, as being so geekily in love with some guy that doesn't know i exist. Alot of great classic lines, that myself and other people i know love to quote to this day, and a total laughfest. even today this movie is still great. It's got a totally awesome 80s' soundtrack and a great cast of colorful characters. if you are 30ish, and have never seen this movie, see it! it will give you memories of those old glory days' of high school."
4,:),"Good movie - I really enjoyed it! I've seen it many times, and still enjoy watching it! I recommend it!"
5,DVD,This is my favorite movie of all times. I watched it most Saturdays as a teenager. The DVD was shipped quick and I am happy to ad it to my 80's DVD collection.
5,classic comming of age movie,"My husband from Ireland had never seen this movie, so we rented it and he loved it as much as I always have. Hilarious. Reminds me of all the same ""characters"" from my high school years. The ""perfect"" girls and the desperately nerdy girls who were more fun than all of them put together. Every kid should see this movie and have hope."
2,Not this version,"I love this movie, but not this version. Buy a different edition than this. It's okay if you just want to watch the movie. I don't like the extra features at all. People who had nothing to do with the movie were talking about it. The features were not special. Buy this movie, but not this edition."
4,80's High School At It's Best!,"This is one of my all time fav. movies. It's high school at it's best. The idea that the ""POPULAR"" guy could actually be interested in the younger and not as popular girl, is the stuff of dreams. :) Anthony Michael Hall brings the comic relief and the sisters wedding is down right ""fall on the floor"" laughter. A great movie..and, an all time classic!"
2,"Dude, where's my commentary?","For a movie that was an 80's staple and one that is in constant, popular rotation, the lack of detail given to this DVD is staggering. Many of us grown and raised in the 80's would have paid a pretty penny for a well-done, packed collector's edition of this movie. No trailer or featurettes either? Ugh.That said and written, Molly Ringwald is the queen of 80's teen comedy. In this sad age of ""Fast and Furious"" and other atrocious sequels, it's nice to look back and hail the glory of John Hughes and the glory that was Shermerr, Illinois. Where have you gone, Jake Ryan - our nation turns it's lonely eyes to you"
1,BROKEN in Mac OS X Lion - BEWARE,"I have both this video dictionary as well as the one from NTID/RIT. Upon getting a new Mac that has Lion, both were broken due to the discontinuation of support for PowerPC binaries in Lion. I wrote NTID and Gallaudet both, and NTID supplied the newest version free and it worked. Gallaudet responded that they have no plans to update the dictionary. I reminded them that their campus is FULL of Macs...One star for it being broken in Lion as a warning for others. The book and the dictionary are both wonderful otherwise, and are a great addition to your collection! I just hope they issue a new version that is Mac-compatible."
4,Good dictionary,"This is a nice basic sign language dictionary. The DVD is helpful as well, especially for some of the more complex signs. DVD plays only on the computer."
3,could be a lot better,"I'm learning ASL and enjoy watching ASL videos. This book is good but the DVD is even better. But then why am I giving it three stars? They list the 3000 words but you can't scroll up and down using your mouse scroll. You have to press up or down on their screen and it doesn't have a page up or page down. I end up dragging it but it is hard to grab it because it is so small, like a bold line. You can't have it play continuous or random.They took all this time putting together a great visual signing and then the program that runs it is poorly made. The signing is great but its hard to get to it.I also wish Gallaudet would put out some more. So they haven't lost me. Just asking it to be better."
3,Wish I'd known that the DVD doesn't work in Mac OS Lion,"The dictionary is nice, but I really wanted to be able to use the DVD along with it. However, it will not work in Mac OL Lion. Very unfortunate!"
2,Another book is better.,"Another book is better than the Gallaudet Dictionary of American Sign Language. The better book is the Random House Webster's American Sign Language Dictionary, Unabridged. It contains dictionary definitions for the words you are looking up, an explanation of the reason why the sign is the way it is, and a written explanaition of how to make the sign. None of these features are in the Gallaudet Dictionary.At first I did not understand the value of the dictionary definitions in the Random House Dictionary. But then I realized that some English words have very different meanings which are represented by completely different signs. For Example, the word ""country"" can mean a foreign state or a rural location. Those two meanings have are represented by two different signs."
4,Great reference with DVD of signs,"This dictionary comes with a DVD of people performing the signs - incredibly helpful as sometimes it is hard to figure out how a sign looks by simply looking at a drawing in a book. Be aware that a lot of the signs are East Coast signs (naturally, as Gallaudet is in Washington DC) so you may see some diversity in a lot of the signs if you are not on the East Coast. Overall, a great investment."
1,Beware the DVD,"We purchased a copy of this title for our library and were disappointed to learn that the DVD cannot be played in a standard DVD player (connected to a television set), but must be played in a computer DVD drive."
3,Good for Advanced Signers,"This is a great book for advanced signers. Not a lot of words for kids. Some of my special education students are non-verbal and we teach them simple signs. We are now working on Halloween signs, of which I could only find a few in this book. I had to go back to my SEE sign book."
2,"very simple, not a lot of words","I am learning to sign and have purchased several books. This one is by far the worse. There are no directions for the movement of the signs, not any description or definitions of the signs. The pictures and words are simple. There is not a lot of complexity to this book. I believe it is overpriced and could be used by a child learning to sign words without knowing the definitions or history of the sign animation. (I admit that I have not tried the DVD yet, it might be useful.)"
4,Good buy,One of the better dictionaries for people learning ASL because it includes a DVD demonstrating all of the signs listed.
4,For the real Dead Head,"The more I listen to this CD, the more I like it. I enjoy this CD because I've never heard most of these tracks. It's like I've found a golden nugget. I'm currently reading Mcnally's book, ""A Long Strange Trip: The Inside History of the Grateful Dead"" and I find myself purchasing all of the dead's officially released albums as the story unfolds - because I want to! Wake of the Flood is as well produced as the other remastered releases I've gotten so far but it has no major hits. It's a record that was made while the band was trying to find it's way after Pigpen's death. It's truely for the serious Dead Head. So, if you are a serious Dead Head, get it and complete your collection of the Dead's back catalog. DTM."
4,"GOOD, NOT GREAT","Good studio album for the Dead, but could be better. Not as good as Blues for Allah, In The Dark, American Beauty, and probably Workingmans Dead...BUT a solid effort. I would get the Dicks Picks from 1974, and the Road Trips 1974 first though from [...]. ESPECIALLY DP 31 and DP 12, and DP14--They are among the best DP's and have most of the songs on this album as they are from the same time period."
2,Not the best!,This bible is not one I would highly recommend for women it jumps all over the place and is not interesting!
2,Jack off Jill meets Garbage,This is alright. I say the vocals are a mix between Garbage and Jack off jill. It has a very teenage feel to it.
3,"Good, but not great",Stick with Lacuna Coil or Nightwish. This CD is good but there's not much creative departure from the various tracks. There are better CDs out there for this type of music.
4,It's infectious!,"I was a fan of their first CD, but thought it had some cheese to it (i.e. the cover). They found an even better singer and the songs are just as catchy as the first one. It took me 2-3 listens before I really started digging this one, but I really like it now."
2,Aerosoles are usually soooo comfortable!,"I was dissapointed in these shoes, I love Aerosoles and these didn't meet their usual standard. They are cute, but not as comfortable as I have found in this brand in the past."
3,Not so comfy,"I like those well- called ""ugly cute"" shoes BUT I think they're not so comfy than others Aerosoles. Also,the rubber sole looks "" dirty""."
3,Brenda,"I like these. They may look a little juvenile with the thick soles, but they don't when they're on. Very comfortable and look especially well with dress pants or jeans."
1,Poor Quality + No Direct USB Adapter,"Bad quality: people complained that they couldn't hear me well. Also, I don't like the fact that this requires a mini to micro uSB adapter. Why couldn't they just run with the standard USB adapter, like the H700. I am very disappointed in this product."
5,(5/5) Slappin' tha Bass Mannn!,"Wonderful 2.1 speaker system with a really strong bass giving sub-woofer! Could possibly be the best 2.1 speaker system on the market for it's price. When watching media and gaming on my desktop, the audio was very responsive; it immerses you into the virtual world. The sub-woofer can hit very low pitches and the tweeter can hit very high notes.Pros:- Inexpensive- Medium-sized satellite speakers with powerful sound- Powerful Sub-woofer for a small to medium size area (YEEE!!!)- Direct/physical controls for the speakers (volume) and sub-woofer (bass level)- Very easy to set up (perfect if you don't want to get 5.1 speakers and mess with the wiring)Cons:- NoneRecommendation(s)/Suggestion(s):- NoneEnjoy this sound system in a small to medium sized room!"
5,Excellent PC speakers,I'm very happy I finally broke down and got these to replace an older set that just didn't sound good. These are by far the best sounding computer speakers I've ever heard. I actually like listening to music from my PC now. The only complaint would be that the subwoofer is rather large for a PC speaker system; it takes up quite a bit of room under the desk. I highly recommend these for anyone who would rather hear sound from their computer instead of noise.
5,Excellent system; excellent price.,"Without question, the best 2.1 speaker system on the market. Great for music and gaming. The speakers have a very balanced sound. The amp is a bit on the large side, though."
4,good for the price,"I upgraded my 4 year old speaker system with these. These ones get louder, with great base. Only thing I think they are missing is mid-range quality. Other than that, I think they are a great buy. I like them alot."
5,Excellent System,"Big bang for the buck. This system rocks, sounds terrific, and looks nice too. Good quality and great price."
5,Much better than the 2.0 Bose,"I had recently purchased a pair of the Bose 2.0 Companion series 2 speakers (no subwoofer with these) to replace an aging set of Altec Lansing 2.1's. The Bose speakers are good, but only at lower volumes in my opinion. The base is sorely lacking as is the volume. Again, the Bose have no subwoofer and they do produce decent sound at lower volumes, I was just expecting more from Bose speakers. The Logitec's do NOT have these problems. They are ridiculously loud (can't turn them up over halfway without things falling off the walls!) and the base is equally strong, maybe a bit too strong. This is correctable by equalizer settings if you don't like base all that much. The sub is a bit large and heavy but it's not a big deal. All in all, a superior buy compared to the Bose especially if you enjoy your music a bit on the loud side...like me!"
2,Speakers where good for a little under two years.,"I got these speakers two years ago for about $75, they worked great for the time that they worked. I used them for just listening to music in my room, watching a movie on my laptop or even for parties. They deliver the bass I wanted for a reasonable price. The PROBLEM is that after a little under two years they just stopped working, couldn't find a reason for it. This was a problem that some people had written about in other reviews online.All in all, I would buy these speakers for no more that $75, which you can find good deals if you spend a little time looking, and if you don't mind if they only will last you around two years."
3,Not bad ... not great,"Like many people who are looking at this product I first looked at the Logitech Z - 2300 speaker system because after looking over countless online reviews this was the set that often came out at the top of the list of speaker systems within my price range. While I can't say I am exactly disappointed I am a little underwhelmed with its performance. After comparing the sound of this system with that of my old Harmon Kardon 395 speakers I feel that while both are good speakers I do miss the richer treble tones coming from the old HK speakers. In my opinion the Logitech speakers tend to be either too bass heavy or too hollow. I often have trouble finding a good ""middle sound"". All in all they are not bad speakers but perhaps not as good as the ""THX-certified"" label would imply. I would definitely only purchase when they are on sale."
2,one of the speakers is broken,"The Logitech logo of one of the speakers is broken. When I shook the speakers, i heard some weird sound coming from the inside... I have not tested it yet. The speakers are apparently fragile, however there is no packaging material inside the box to protect the speakers."
3,"Very loud, but weak midrange performance","Yes, they are very loud. They are inexpensive. But the midrange (where voices are) sounds muddy and underpowered compared to the overwhelming bass and high frequencies. I'm finding songs lack definition and punch in the right places, while the loud volume just sort of slaps my ears around. I suggest finding something with less power and better frequency response."
2,Great until it breaks,"I had an under monitor mounted speaker and decided to get an upgrade. Bought this Z2300 system. It was like night and day. The bass filled out the sound great and the two smaller speakers worked good. After 6 months, I started noticing a lack of bass. I unplugged the two desktop speakers and hardly nothing was coming out of the bass box, just a super muddy muffled sound. Maybe I blew the speaker, but I don't crank it up often. Looks like I now have a 20 pound slightly vibrating paper weight. This sucks."
5,Chest Thumping,"This has been a cnet.com editor's choice since 2004, and that speaks for itself. Of course, the proof of the pudding is in your home. I loved it. What I did not love was that two weeks after I bought it, amazon.com ran a special that knocked $25 off the already excellent price. Bummer! The system's sound is room-filling, can be chest thumping and is a world apart from the usual computer speakers one has come to expect."
5,You will hear things you never heard before.,"You know the feeling you get when your in the movie theater, its the last 15 minutes of the movie, the plot is climaxing and the music is doing the same with rich bass rolling over the audience in actual waves that you can feel in your chest, and rattle the seats? Do yourself a favor, take this feeling home with you to every video game and hd movie you own. Turn the volume and bass up and make your neighbors despise you. Im no audio person, Im much more a visual artist, but that doesn't mean that I don't recognize amazing speakers when I see them, and I cannot wait to watch inception on these bad boys. The bass rattles each of the doors in my apartment. Thank goodness Im sitting 2 feet away."
1,Chunky cheap plastic.,"When theLogitech Z-2300 THX-Certified 2.1 Speaker System with Subwooferarrived, the FedEx guy looked a little ticked off. I signed for the package... then strained to pick the box up. That's when he smiled and wished me a nice day. I lugged the box to my office (at the far end of my house). I carefully opened the box and removed some of the plastic bags. This was my second attempt with Logitech speakers. I put everything together on my worktable before committing the behemoth base unit's final destination. I was troubled by the old school 9-pin connector (from the remote to the base unit). 9-pin connectors are notoriously noisy. Guess what! The 9-pin connector failed."
5,Grandson gift,"My grandson suggested this gift as a Graduation, from High School, gift. He plans to take it to college for use while there. I purchased, and have given it to him. He was excited."
5,Rip-off,"I was unable to cancel the second order for this item. It was mistakenly ordered. I wound up paying shipping charges I did not recover trying to return the second item. Website was confusing and I was not able to talk to anyone by phone to straighten this out.Will not use Amazon Ordering unless absoultly necessary.Customer,R. Davis"
5,Disappointing Service,Subwoofer for this unit did not work. Requested a return and a new unit. Was told this would be done. Returned item and full amount paid was refunded. When I checked Amazon's website it said this item was not available. Had to order from another source. Would have been nice if someone at Amazon had told me that.
3,OK for the price but add stuffing to the sub,"I enjoy good audio and have Paradigm and B&W speakers with Rotel equipment. This 2.1 setup is OK but the subwoofer booms badly. I removed the amplifier plate and put in about a gallon of speaker dampening, Acust-Stuf Polyfill. I left space around the transformer and the amplifier for cooling. Slightly packed the Polyfill around the speaker and loosley around the port tube opening, huge improvement. The 2 other speakers do lack midrange so I replaced them with some small paradigm speakers. Oh yes they sound great now. Do you really think you can get a good 2.1 for $100? well you can not, but with a few changs you will get great sound with the stuffed sub and 2 pretty good regular speakers. The described setup is prety darn good."
5,Fantastic,It definately pays to read all the reviews on a product before buying. All the reviews on this speaker system were right on. It is the best for the money that anyone could purchase in my opinion. It sure brings my laptop to life with it's rich sounds. The subwoofer is rather large but the overall sound is amazing. I am extremely happy my new Logitech Z-2300.
3,For the price I like them,"Could use some more mid range but overall, they get the job done. I use the system to listen to Pandora while I work as well as for listening to tracks I create with GarageBand. I think they get the job done for their price range, no regrets."
4,Still a Contender for your Speaker needs,"I just picked this model up a couple of weeks ago and I'm quite satisfied I did.It's really quite amazing that this model keeps popping up on forums and in reviews after six years on the market. And now after using them, I'm a believer.Yeah, they're not perfect. The sub's huge, maybe too big, but it's got a lot of power. The satellites are hardwired, etc. But the sound they produce is quite good. I'm not an audiophile but I dig this model for its fidelity and also its price range.These speakers and sub are a great deal."
2,bad speakers,"I bought these speakers And they where pretty amazing the best speakers i ever had, but i have to give it 1 star because they broke in a month and i never moved them or dropped them, never even damaged them........."
5,Unbelievable!!!!!,My friend had the same one and told me to try them. I never thought they were going to give such a good bang with the bass and how loud they are. I never play it past half way volume and i love loud music. I thought logitech wasnt like that big of a brand. I dont know if they are but this product is no joke. If you really want a ridiculous speaker system for a great price these are the ones. Trust me u think they wont be that good but you will be surprised im in college and in my dorm i play it half way and the people in the study lounge downstairs complained ahaha. GET THESE!
2,No mids,"I'm really disappointed with this system. It is no good for music. The mids to low-mids are really weak and the high-mids to highs are over saturated. It gives a metallic/shrill quality to the sound. I couldn't stand it. Also, there is an awful hum coming from the amplifier even with the power off. It's not loud but just loud enough to make me unplug the system. I also have a 3 year old Logitec z-5300 and an 11 year old Panasonic SAAK29; both way better. They have a full, warm sound to them and the bass is much tighter (especially on the Panasonic.) I guess I should not have expected so much out of such a cheap system; my other 2 systems each cost more than twice as much. This was not what I expected, so I'm giving the Z-2300 to my little sister. I'll use my old Panasonic SAAK29 for now and maybe I'll pick up the new Corsair SP2500."
4,"Great Sound, Great System",Sounds awesome. It is too bad I didn't have room for the 5 speaker system. But this three piece set works great. Plenty of power and works like it should. I kind of wish it had a wireless remote but really isn't a big deal.
3,These speakers are great !!!,"The upgrade was perfect however if they only had a treble adjuster that would be great. Many reviewers complained about the size of subwoofer and they are right cause the size is a little extreme. i still managed to accommodate considering the size of room and desk location.the Bass is awesome and the overal sound is clear. Amazon had the best price, however it took about 9 days to get them. Good thing it wasn't critical. I would recommend this set."
5,Fantastic Speakers,"I have these speakers in the den,and I recently bought the same speakers for the computer in my dinning room, and the sound quality just cannot be beat in this price range."
5,I love bass!,"pros-yeah, this product is pretty sweet, very crisp and clear at any volume. And with the adjustable bass you can hear all the pretty music you want or drowned out every thought in your brain. This product makes it feel like your there in person.cons-only one complaint, the speakers do not mount to anything. so they just have to sit on your desk."
4,Logitech Z-2300 Speakers,I have had these speakers for awhile now. Long enough to put them to some good use. I wanted to buy the Bose Companion 3 speakers [...]. Save alot of money and quite happy with this purchade and the money I saved. These speakers do not match up to the Bose but is still a great choise if you want to spend the money you save on something else. Lots of volume and LOTS of bass. I think easily adjusted with the equalizer in the computer.
5,Awesome 2.1 system,"Words cannot do this system justice. The highs are crystal clear, the mids are beautiful, and the bass is mind blowing. The bass will literally shake the walls but it is not overpowering towards the rest of the sound. It all blends seamlessly for an amazing audio experience the likes of which you will not soon forget. The system delivers on its promise of distortion proof bass. This is a system that will go to 11 and remain amzing in its audio quality. This system is an absolute steal for the price. Do not hesitate to buy this system you will not be disapointed. I am in love with this system and you will be too. Works great for music and movies. This is a system that will not fail to impress."
4,Great...except for the midrage,"These speakers were ideal for what I bought them for: to supplement a 42"" flat screen TV in a 12 X 11 foot home office. The speakers of the TV supply the exact amount of mid range that these unfortunately lack. Great value."
4,Good but not Great,I received the speakers earlier today. I'm listening to them now. The bad news is that the cymbals don't sizzle. I read the other reviews about missing mid range. The mid range is there. Just not much presence on the high end. No bells. You won't hear any frets on the strings. On the other hand... these speakers could fill a stadium with music. The bass is effortless... and loud. You will spend more time turning down the volume than turning it up.
2,"short life, sounds okay","good product, but...it died in a year.the wires from the PC connect to one of the small speakers. It controls volume and power. [the subwoofer plugs into a 120 V ac power supply, also.]the control switch is loosely wired. the cords [1 from pc, 1 to the other speaker and 1 to the subwoofer] began stretching immediately. I looped them and taped them to the body of the speaker. it only slowed the process.bare wire was visible, after a few months. Finally, the sound buzzed and was intermittent.the speaker bodies don't open easily, so rewiring and soldering would be a bear."
5,Quality!,"This system is quite amazing. I was pleasantly surprised when I turned it on the first time. The subwoofer and the speakers have such great frequency response. The little wired remote it comes with is very handy. It has volume and bass level controls on it so you don't have to fumble around with the controls on the computer. Overall, this product is great. If you're thinking about buying it, please do because you will not be disappointed."
5,Great 2.1 Speaker System,I have the Logitech Z-2300 THX system on my computer. My stepson listened to it and requested one for this Christmas.The system sounds great when watching videos or listening to music on the computer. The right and left speakers are very clear and crisp sounding. The floor mounted subwoofer has the power to shake items on the computer desk.I like the convenient system control located on the desk. Very easy to plug in my headphones.
3,Great when it was new!,"This speaker system sounds great when it is playing. Unfortunately after a year it has developed a hum at idle that is louder than the other two computers in the room,"
3,All bass,"Warning: the subwoofer is massive. It takes up more space than a mini desktop computer. It's so heavy that I'm tempted to sell it when I move. I can't imagine using the sub at above 25% volume, my neighbors would kill me.On the plus side, the set sounds great when you keep the sub at the lowest setting."
3,Not as clear,"The Bass is there, the mid-range is there, however, I was expecting a lot more clarity out of these."
4,Great quality at a reasonable price!,"Picked up these THX-Certified Z-2300 speakers for a toshiba notebook. It was very easy to connect and I have been very happy with the sound enhancement. The base is very strong although the satellite speakers can a bit more crisp. But all-in-all, not bad for the price. They look great and there is more than enough volume reserve to elicit severe complaints of noise pollution from your neighbors."
2,Fantastic... until they break,"The z2300's sound fantastic for the price. If I were writing the review two weeks ago, it would be a five star review. Unfortunately, the wired remote recently failed (it only outputs audio on the left channel now), and my speakers are out of warranty. I contacted Logitech asking about purchasing a replacement remote, and was told that my only option was to buy an entirely new set of speakers - they will not make replacement parts available. While I hate to pan an otherwise great product for a single issue, this policy is wasteful and unfriendly to customers, and has ensure that I will not only not replace my z2300s with another set of Logitech speakers, but I'll be avoiding all Logitech products going forward."
5,Too Too Good,Excellent sub woofer for affordable price.Damm Damn decent sound quality & price.Tweeters produce sound with high fidelity.Pros : Blast ur appartment ...Cons : cant go upto the max volume !!!..
5,best speakers best price,"These speakers sound so nice. I have a system in my car and these sounds just as good minus all the loose parts in my car that rattle. The sub sounds nice a bassy the way I like it. Amazon has the best price I've found and I've been looking for a while. They sound good with every kind of music, and the free shipping said they would be here in at least 5 days and they got here in 2 days! I love these speakers and i love the price."
5,Awesome!,"I bought these for a friend for Christmas whose music is very important to her, she has been in music heaven since she got them. I saw these in Circuit City, but the demo there did it NO justice! I bought these based on the reviews on this site, and couldn't be happier! She is using the standard sound card that comes equipped in a HP pavilion computer. The sound is clear and crisp with awesome bass! There is no better deal for the price. Excellent product, thank you!"
3,Speaker meant for Hip-Hop songs only (High Bass),"I returned these speakers since the bass is very high (since the speakers is 200 watts and just the woofer is 120 watts).There's a bass adjustment button on the remote. But even if you keep it at the minimum, you'll still hear a high bass.Conclusion - These speakers are great if all you listen to is Hip-Hop songs. But if you like and listen to all types of music (love songs, melody, etc...) get a speaker with less watts woofer."
4,"BANG BANG BANG , watch the floor SHAKE",PROSBASSLOUDClarityLook GreatGreat PRICECONSSIZE OF SUB!YOU CAN Hear it down the StreetMy Right sat speaker just stopped working ?????Jubrilwww.jubril.com
3,It serves it's purpose,"Look, it serves it's purpose. The base is great, but the speakers themselves can't really handle the 200 watt pressure. My left speaker blew out, absolutely no sound is coming out of it, and I don't even blast the music I listen to. It's cool if you're looking for something cheap and affordable, but don't think this is a ""bose"" type speaker system that delivers amazing sound."
5,Best Sound System for the money,"For those who are only interested in getting a really good movie sound (sparkling highs and a fantastic rumbling bass) without the hassle of having to nail or hide 6 or more wires (for a 5.1 system), this THX certified Z-2300 is simply the best.I had it hooked up to my dvd player in seconds, put a satellite left and right next to the tv, and the boom box underneath, and movies came to life as never before with more then enough power to spare.The only improvement for this system would be a wireless remote."
5,Good bass,If your looking for bass these are the speakers to get. Great for gaming and movies and almost every type of music. Lacks a good clear treble at times but well worth the money.
4,Great Speakers,"I have had these for about a month now, and they are amazing for a 2.1. I am not an audiophile by any means, but they sound good, and are clear even at high volumes. The only gripes that I have, and the reason that I can only give them four stars, is that they only have one audio input, which means that if I want to use them for my computer, and my X Box, and my mp3 player, then I have to unplug from one and replug into another. Also, the cord on the volume/bass control is not very long. Other than that, I could not be more pleased."
5,Best Speaker for the price!!,"Perfect for music, watching video, etc. Sound is excellent!! I bought 2, one after another... because of the quality of the sound and look. Seperate adjustable volume control makes placing the speaker easily."
5,Bigger than i thought they'd be,"I bought these to replace some radioshack quality speakers i had for my computer and was shocked when i opened the package. the subwoofer included is HUGE and definitely not lacking in any power for the everyday user. had it for quite some time now, and have never once regretted this purchase. i mainly listen to dubstep, where quality/bass are very important."
5,sound,"I was looking for speakers for my t.v. in a small den and didn't need the 5 speaker surround sound stuff. this works well. I've found myself using it more with my i-pod. I think the sound is more than i expected. The volume is much more than i needed, but every once in a while i wind it up and the sound quality is good"
4,Awesome sound!,"Really good sound for a computer speaker system, for a moderate price. And the sub-woofer is awesome! As it should be, since it weighs about 25 lbs. Also very nice is the desktop control volume for speakers & sub-woofer, and onff/on. Very handy."
3,wheres the mid?!,"initially i thought this was great, even though it lacks mid range. about 3 weeks into it, the sub started making a popping sound, kind of like there is interference or something. havent been able to correct the problem. popping comes and goes. also bass cannot be turned off completely. i tried adjusting with my EQ to try and bring up the mid range, unfortunately, the speakers just dont have the capability to create certain frequencies. it does however, have very crisp/clean bass and treble when working right. maybe i got a bad one? i still like it, it was cheap and is hands down better than the crappy speakers that come with computers. i reccomend this if you are on a budget, otherwise, get something else."
2,Not worth it,"I spent hours and hours researching 2.1 systems on the market and was eventually convinced by Cnet's extremely high rating on this pair of speakers. I read some negative comments that it lacked midrange, but didn't think much about it....that is, until I had it sitting on my desk. The midrange problem was a serious issue. Really. There was heavy bass, but the midrange was so murky that it felt like as if my speakers were in the next room. Unless you are going to use this only for rock and gaming, I highly recommend you get Klipsch or Soundsticks II."
5,Love it,"Love the sound for a computer speaker system. Its pretty loud , the bass is thumping and sounds quite nice."
5,Great Speakers!,"I needed some punchier speakers with an upfront headphone port. My generic speakers were not cutting it. I reasearched 2.1 speakers a lot and found these speakers to be the best around for approx. $100. Sound coming through them has better clarity and just sounds better. I hear things in songs that I hadn't before. The remote is really useful, and the power button itself is great. On my old speakers, the volume knob was also the power switch, so every time you initially turned it on, you had to tweak the volume. Not with these speakers! Something as simple as a power button makes a huge difference. The bass is amazing, and can be tweaked if is is too much. The mids and highs are crisp as should be. And don't forget the blue led when the speakers are on. It just looks plain cool. These speakers are great! Another quality product from Logitech!"
3,Not bad,"I had the klipsch Pro media 2.1 system, and like many others, the amp blew out, mine were 2 months out of warranty. I bought these due to raving reviews from everyone on multiple sites.I have a Creative X-FI extreme gamer fatality pro sound card on my PC, plugged in these speakers and have to say, I was a bit dissapointed in the overall sound.Comparing to my dead klipsch's, the sound is not as full, highs are a bit tinny, bass is muddy, the klipsch were a better all around speaker, except for the amp issue, unfortunately.I will try and tweak the sound on my machine and see if I can improve the sound, but as for a final grade I give the speakers a C+. Anyone who says these speakers sound better than a typical home theater system are incorrect. Should not even be mentioned in these types of reviews, Ill put my home theater against any speaker you can buy from Logitech."
2,This is hip-hop-only speakers. Avoid if you're going to listen to something different.,"Just want to say that the bass is extremely good, soft, clear, and strong... too strong.The problem is that although the sub woofer is great, the other two small-sized speakers cannot cope with high frequencies with the same level of success. However, if you try to bring these high-freqs up, your bass will become a disaster. And there is no easy way to balance your bass and your high freqs, even with the external bass regulator.There is no middle-frequencies at all. I didn't hear anything and, as in the case of high-freqs, if I try to bring them up nothing happens. Looks like there is no real hardware to output anything except bass.I don't really understand how this kind of speakers happened to be so high in the rating. How can people listen to them at all. They just change the output so much.P.S.: I was using EMU 0202 audio interface and Sony MDR-EX71 headphones as reference, so this is not a sound card problem."
4,what it says,This product is exactly as described. Bass is great for a small compact speaker system. Not quite Studio Monitor level but close for the low price.
5,AMAZING,"These things are EXTREMELY crisp and LOUD. I was comapring them to the bose 2.1 and after factoring in the prise, there is no comaprison. These blow the Bose out in every way!"
2,NOT FOR THOSE WHO LIKE IT CLEAR AND LOUD,"I bought these speakers about three weeks ago and eventually returned them. While these speakers do sound decent at lower listening levels they loose their clarity when the volume is turned passed 50%. To be honest, I have never heard so much distortion from any speakers in this price range. I honestly can't recommend these for any reason due to that fact alone.Save up your money and buy some Klipsch speakers or the old Altec Lansings with the wooden sub enclosure. Even Bose are better than these........"
5,Absolute Greatness,"This is a great set of speakers. Do not listen to other reviews about a lack of mid levels, they are there and they boom just like the bass. These speakers are loud, I keep mine at less then a quarter volume and that is perfect music listening to loudness. Its great that the wire is a 1/8"" which is the size of headphones so its easy to listen to your ipod through the speakers or just plug it right into your computer. Overall these are great and deffinatly a steal. I would highly reccomend these to anyone."
5,Super..,"I bought it one month ago...I am very happy with sound quality, performance ...really enjoying it.....however only things bother me is remote system which is not of good quality.. still i would recommend it for music lovers"
4,"speaker good ,reward offered BAD!!!!!!!","speaker work good, reward offered by logitech it is not good, I sent all information to get reward including UPC# and they said I did not sent."
4,"not for music, but for movie and game","I got it for $90 (dented box) after tax from logitech. The look is brilliant. The bass is huge both physically and in performance. On certain types of music, the sound is not crystal, but muddy. I watched dark knight blu-ray with it. I was like sitting in a cinema. The bass is rocking my apartment. I would add it to part of my home theater and gaming, but not music."
4,Good value for a PC sound system,This is my second system of this make and model. The first one was damaged during a move. The quality is the same and the price came down. It's a good system for someone that just needs a PC-based system and isn't looking for a lot of exotic technology.
4,Great Quality,"I purchased these speakers for my mothers computer, so she could play music throughout her house. they sound great and i'd definitely buy them again."
4,Good System,Installed this system on teenagers computer system. They like it for the type of music they listen too. Easy to setup.
4,Not bad...,"I purchased the Z-2300 system about 6 months ago and up until now have been very pleased. While I find that the mid-range is a bit weak, the design and the delivery have been very impressive. However, just the other day the right speaker stopped working. I don't know if this type of failure is common, but I hate to think that it is. Other than that I have had no qualms."
5,Pound 4 Pound,An A+ buy! Get your ears ready for an audio baptism! The THX Certified is certifiably good quality sound.
5,Great sound for great price!,"After reading reviews for a couple of weeks, it seems that for this price range, these speakers are definitely worth it. The immense power that they have is astounding. Despite the fact that there is very little mid range, the sheer depth of the sound (accentuated by the bass levels) makes up for the lacking. They handle all sorts of music very well and have impressed me with how they handle cinema sound. They are - of course - THX-certified, and it does come through with the variable sounds in watching films. They look great, sound great, and are the best desktop speakers for the price. I recommend the Z-2300 to other customers."
3,"Good sound, bad parts",Love the sound quality. Great base. Went through 5 fuses in 2 weeks before I got it warrantied. Hoping I don't have the same problem now.
3,"Good, but get the AV-40s instead","I bought these a couple of years ago for my home office and I've enjoyed them. I never felt like the mid ranges were crisp and clear enough, but by and large I thought they were very competent speakers for the money. And I still do.but I decided to move these to my business office where I didn't have external speakers and occasionally (but less frequently) wish I did, so I wanted to buy speakers to replace these at home. I researched and ended up getting the M-Audio AV-40s.The AV-40s are MUCH better speakers than these Z-2300s. Plain and simple. Cleaner bass, much fuller mid ranges, tight highs. For the money these AV-40s are great speakers and are FAR superior to the Z-2300s.You can get the Logitech's for less than $100 at some places and if that's your price point, get them and you'll enjoy them. But if you can afford just a little more, get the AV-40s. Your ears will thank you."
1,Great until they break,"What people say on here is true... Very nice speakers for the value, unless they break on you. I've had to return two of these so far; on the first set, the left channel stopped working, on the second set, the same thing happened... except this time it was the actual satellite speaker. I never overdrive my speakers... I bought this for casual listening to substitute my studio set-up. Always unplugged when not in use, never sat/put stuff on the sub, never plugged it into something when it was on, never turned it up past 100W, never tugged on the cables... the fuse is still in tact.Like I said, it's great when it works, just hope you don't run into problems. Returning it is easy hassle free if you do... but I'm still unhappy with the product."
1,DOA Logitech x-2300,My Logitech Z-2300 arrived DOA. There was no power going out from the sub woofer to the controls or speakers. I don't know were they are assembled but their quality control leaves a lot to be desired. I have reordered a another and we'll see if it works. Until then.
2,"EMPTY Sound Almost ""Muted""","I purchased these based on the reviews here and around the web. I can say on the positive side that they are loud with strong base. However, the sound has very little clarity. It's like when you hear a song the sounds (voices etc) are distant and not sharp and clear. That must be what the people who say the Mid-range isn't there because they are right.I have a pair of older Altec Lansing speakers with an accompanying sub attached. I paid $69 for them. The clarity and sharpness is MUCH better on those and they cost half the price. If you want loud banging sound these Logitechs Z-2300's will do the job but if you want better sounding better experience I would go with another pair of speakers. I assume the Kilipsh competing brand mentioned in some of these reviews here will sound much better.If my older Altec Lansing speakers can beat these on sound then I'm sure the Kilipsh set will do much better than these Logitechs."
4,Almost too much bass!,Easy and intuitive hookup. Sub is a little tall compared to my old one and it does have black heat radiating fins on the backside but it looks clean. The remote controller is such a nice feature to have because now I have my speakers behind my monitors I don't need to leave them in view to always plug in headphones or change volume or bend down to change the bass it's all right there. Fired it up in my two bedroom condo and was quickly adjusting the equalizer to try and bring the bass down some because I don't want to rattle the neighbors paintings off their walls LOL. Just out of the box but so far so good.
5,MY REVIEW ON THIS PRODUCT,"THESE ARE AWESOME ,GREAT SOUND , LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS SET UP .WOULD RECOMEND THEM TO ANYONE. AND FOR THE PRICE , YOU JUST CAN'T BEAT IT. A++++++++++++++++ ALL THE WAY."
2,I don't really like the sound,"It's very heavy and the sound is very heavy too. Personally, I don't like the sound"
5,This speaker system is the bomb,"THIS SPEAKER SYSTEM IS THE BOMB, THE MUSIC IS LOUD AND CLEAR I RECCOMEND THIS ITEM TO ANY BUYER LOOKING FOR A SPEAKER SET FOR THEIR COMPUTER SYSTEM."
2,No volume control for satellite speakers,"If you turn up volume, the satellite speakers get fried so fast if you dont watch out.. There needs to be two separate volume control knobs each for subwoofer and the satellite speakers.. Those satellite speakers just cant handle the big watts (up to 40 watts each) coming at them without any separate volume control . I am a loud nutcase, cant you understand that? The subwoofer just goes on and on like a workhorse!! minus my fried satellites, boo hoo!"
5,Great Speakers,"These are great speakers for the value. I spent several hours doing research on good speakers and the Logitec Z-2300 were always getting great reviews. I've had them for a couple months now and they are the best speakers I've ever owned for a pc. The sound is amazing. The subwoofer is very powerful and I actually turn it down to around 40% when I'm playing low volume.The only down side is once you get them up past 50% volume, you can hear static in the satellite speakers. Once you turn the volume back down, the sound is great."
2,It sounds OK when it works,"I had a problem with this unit right out of the box. The wire that connects the volume and bass control had a short in it, which caused a terribly loud hum. If the wire was positioned ""just right"" the hum disappeared and the speakers sounded good. Unfortunately, when the wire moved, the terribly loud hum would return, whether or not the system was actually in use.My initial report to Logitech was handled very quickly. However, it has been two weeks since I forwarded them the purchase documentation they requested. In spite of repeated queries, I have not heard anything more from Logitech."
2,really disappointed,"Bass is vague and very loud even at the lowest setting - (it overpowers the satellites)Mid-range response of the satellite speakers is really poorHigh range response of the satellite speakers is ""tinny""Both the sub-woofer and the speakers look and feel cheapOverall the sound isn't balanced, and is poor for TV/Movies and even worse for music - In fact the satellite speakers are so poor, I'll have to replace them with something better -Based on the reviews and ratings I was expecting A LOT MORE -In my opinion, not worth the money(and I really am not that picky)"
5,one loud son of a gun,"One loud son of a gun. I bought this product when it was on sale (~$80). I have this for over two years now and I literally abused it. As a drummer, I love the loud music and this thing is powerful. Before this, only speakers that I own was Harman kardon but it was getting bit pricy.I would recommend this to anyone."
3,Klipsch Pro Media sound better,"I recently purchased these speakers through Amazon and while I think at $79 they are a great deal, for a little more money you can get the Klipsch Pro Media 2.1 system which sounds quite a bit better (I have both). People that have mentioned the Z-2300's sounding tinny are right on the money. Even with an Audigy 2 sound card and EQ tuning, the Logitechs just don't sound as rich and accurate as the Klipsch speakers. However if you can't afford the extra $50 dollars or so for the Pro Media 2.1's, the Z-2300's will serve you well....the Logitechs aren't bad speakers by any means, they are just ok."
2,Overrated,"I bought these speakers to replace my aging Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 set, and it was a mistake.There are certain things about these speakers I love such as the wired remote, smaller satellites, and better location of the headphone jack, but they fall short in the most basic aspect you want from any speaker: the audio.These speakers have no midrange. The bass is outstanding which is to be expected as the subwoofer is huge, and the highs are very crisp, and clear, but there is no midrange. This makes the audio sound hollow if you are listening to any music with a lot of midrange, ie rock and roll. They sound great for hip hop, or techno, but anything guitar heavy will suffer.I'm not an audiophile with a stereo system that costs thousands of dollars. I'm just a gamer, and music lover who isn't fooled by speakers that have a lot of bass, and power, but lack actual audio quality.I'm keeping my Klipschs."
5,Best in its class,I was debating to get some Bose speakers but ended up getting these thinking they would do the job 'ok'. Once I plugged them in I was blown away at the high quality sound...I am so glad I made this decision. You will never raise the bass more than halfway unless you want your neighbors to complain. No regrets getting this system...been almost 3 months and I still love em like my first day.
5,Real Nice Speakers At A Really Good Price,"I first became aware ot the Logitech Z-2300 speakers while searching the [...].Almost everyone who review these speaker gave them really good praise.To my dismay the speakers was being no longer sold at [...],so I went to [...] and was able to get the speakers.[...].When sold at Best Buy these speakers was over $[...]!My speakers came in a few quick days,and was soon hook to my computer.The Dell entry level computer(still nice)had the Jukebox music hardware install already,so now I have almost 2500 songs on it.I hope to have almost all the Billboard Top 40 Rock/Pop/Soulsongs from 1955-1980 on there in due time.Back to the Logitech Z-2300 speakers-they are really good.Even with the low end computer they still put out great sound and lots of power!the only downside is as noted by some is the mid range is not to good,but these are still really good speakers.Highly recommended!"
5,logitec z-2300,"This system rocks, it is loud, the bass is clear and the mid-tones don't crackle. Really sounds good for a 2.1 system, but don't expect 5.1 sound from this... its 2.1. It is just as loud as most any 5.1 system just the sound comes from 3 speakers. This system was exactly what I hoped for. The only downfall... if you want to call it that. Is that the powered sub is a bit large, but if size don't matter the bass makes up for it. Great system, I have had other logitech speaker systems as well as the harman kardon sound sticks, this system blows them away."
4,Best 2.1 System for Music and Movies too,"I usually do a lot of research before buying any product, especially an electronic.I had Altec Lansing 2.1 speakers before this.Though they were small and not that expensive, they were really good. Now when I thought to buy a new set, I opted for these primarily due to the THX certification at a decent price.Here are the pros and cons:Pros: Excellent Sound Quality- Both for music and moviesSuperb BaseGreat LookingDecent length wires(Some people complain about that but I feel its enough for the type of speaker system-its not a home theatre after all...though it does that job pretty well too !! )Great remote-very convenientCons: The only thing which would make it unbeatable, if it had another control for Treble. Not that its treble is not great, but just for some poor quality songs for which you feel you could have enjoyed more with extra treble.Conclusion: Great buy for the value."
4,Great product for the price I bought at,"This logitech system works great with my computer. It turned it into a nice home theater which is great because I love watching movies at home. I bought this system on black Friday in 2010, so I got a great deal I(think I bought it for about 100 to 120$) Right now (October 2011) the price is $450.The Bass is amazing and the satellite speakers work great, the only problem is that doesn't come with a remote control."
5,Good Stuff,"not to be funny, I use this speaker in my university's dorm and it caused the school security came visited me for at least 3 times in 2months..the voice is clear and the bass is powerful. i like to put something on top of the bass and later on i couldnt find them right there anymore.. 70% Bass is sufficient enough to blow off my dorm's floor even i can hear it in the shower room 150ft away LOL.. my friends love to borrow this speaker for house party even events on campus~ =)"
5,Unbelievable speakers especially for the price!,These speakers are great! I bought them for my dorm room and they are awesome! The bass is deep and clean and the high and midrange tones sound awesome too. I would buy them again if they were twice as much.
5,Logictech z-2300,"Excellent speakers! Easy listening with good definition. Great bass! Color matches my new black HP quad desktop and 24"" HP monitor perfectly. I am an audio guy with high end 2 channel and 7.1 channel systems for comparison."
5,"the amazing z-2300, bose companion II vs z-2300",I spent around a month trying to decide between bose companion II series II speakers and logitech z-2300 beacuse they were abt the same price. Finally bought Bose but was very much disappointed. The sound started fluctuating when the volume was increased more than half. So i returned bose and bought z-2300 instead. Omg wat a difference.. Now this is what i call speakers. :) Huge Sub and awesome output. Am calling eveyone home tonight and partying.. :)cons: the sub weighs a ton.
4,firefighter,The only thing I found could be better are the hookups in the rear. They need more hookups on the subwoofer so you could add other speakers or just some headphones. but the sound is better than good.
3,Sound quality is mediocre,"I purchased this item and promptly sent it back. I bought it because of the high ratings here, and at CNET but the high accolades aren't justified in my opinion. The sound quality was mediocre at best. The subwoofer did an adequate job but the satellites were terrible, very thin and tinny. I purchased the Klipsch Promedia 2.1 and, for me, they sounded much better. Deeper and richer sound. For you audiophiles, I don't think any of these will make you happy, but the Klipsch unit is pretty good for the price. For gaming and maybe as a tv sound system these units are fine. I guess for mp3 music they're not too bad either, but, In the end I went back to a Carver integrated amp, Boston Acoustics VR M60 reference monitors with a powered sub .... if you really want quality sound for music, you gotta go with more expensive components. I was hoping for an inexpensive way out with a lot less cable interconnects, but it didn't work out."
4,Great speakers for the price!,"I received these speakers about a month ago and have been using them as computer speakers at my desk in an apartment. They're definitely loud enough to function as entertainment center speakers, but my reason for purchasing them was for power and clarity. I use them 95% of the time for music, from ambient/classical to hard rock. The subwoofer packs a punch (though I suggest keeping the sub setting below 12 o clock if you're EQ'ing through your music player). The satellites are a bit on the treble-y side, but a little EQ'ing takes care of that. As with any speaker, they sounded a little harsh for the first 2 weeks of break in, but now are sweet and distinct. Great pair of speakers from a great company."
4,good speakers,"This thing is very powerful and a great setup. At 3/4 power I was able to shake my entire dorm room and get the attention of people two floors down. This thing meets your needs.One thing I didn't like was that I was unable to leave the power on and just set it to stand-by when I wasn't around. After a week of this I noticed an annoying and increasingly powerful buzzing from the speakers. I didn't use it for two days, and now turn it off when I'm not using it and have no problems at all.The system was incredibly easy to set up, and I just pointed the speakers so they converge on where I sit at my desk. The subwoofer is two feet away, on top of the desk, and the sound is perfect. It can lay down a base beat like nobody's business, and the refresh time is fast enough to keep up with 16 beats a measure (as fast as I've tried running it)."
3,It is a great system but it broke,"I bought this speakers and i hooked them up,,, they sounded great,, more than enough to fill a large living room, the bass its really awesome it shakes the windows at full blast!!! I used at at couple of small parties and they worked like a charm,,,,,, but out of nothing the small speakers stopped working and i would had to move the cable,, but after some time it got worst and worst :/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, they were awesome but unfortunately they dont work well."
4,Good speakers,"When I received the speakers, they did not work; there was a problem with the control unit. I called Logitech and they were very willing to send out new speakers once I sent these back. I received the new speakers within a couple of weeks & they worked quite well. I am overall happy with the purchase."
4,Speaker placement is key.,"The speakers are great for the price. If you know a thing about speaker placement, you can make these things harmonize really well. The sub is amazing, and can be adjusted. The speakers, like I said, are good for the money. If you play around with the EQ, you can get them to sound like Bose speakers. haha"
4,a great value,"these speakers are loud, clear and very balanced for the pricetag. i recently replaced my 400 watt band-pass subwoofer stereo that i used for home entertainment purposes with these speakers, and am very satisfied with them.I notice some low-frequency hum with certain devices, but that is probably due to the fact that i have a four-way audio splitter hooked up to it and more length of cable than is required in most cases. not to mention the fact that some connections are 1/8th inch split to stereo rca, which is unavoidable if u wish to use these for uses other than just computer. furthermore, im no audio expert and may have had my input volume too low or something.All in all, a great price (i paid 125-135 between shipping and tax, i forget exactly) for a small, loud, great quality sound system."
3,Died after 6 months,"I liked the sound produced whilst this set was working. I purchased in June 2010 and the right speaker stopped working last November 2010. Luckily it was in the warranty period and Logitech sent me the revised model. I was actually about to purchase the z-5500's, because they were on sale, for my parents but seeing how fast these speakers bust, I decided not to.Recently I saw these went on sale again for even less than I paid on the June sale. I would have purchased another set to complement my current set but I thought I may not be so lucky this time around.I hope these z623s last longer."
4,Center channel would have been nice,"I, like some of the others here went from a 5.1 to a 2.1 system. I never used the surround sound speakers so I didn't consider it a loss. The one thing I do miss is the center channel. The sound is crystal clear. I went from a 6 inch bass speaker to this 8"" inch one. For me the 6"" is plenty and the 8"" takes up an extra amount of space. The bass however is deeper if thats what your after. If I had to do it again, I would find a 3.1 system."
3,"lots of power, but missing mid-range","I was stoked to plug my new speakers in but was immediately disappointed with the quality of sound that came from the speakers. I tested the speakers with different types of music: they are definitely awesome for hiphop and rap - they're a alot of power and the sub is pretty responsive. As for other types of music, not so awesome. The mid-range is almost completely lacking so music that is expansive or meant to be really pretty comes out a a little flat. I would definitely recommend this system for those of you who listen primarily to hiphop, but if your taste is more eclectic than mine, find yourself another system. I wish i had."
2,Broke after a few months of light use,"First of all, do not buy this if you live in an apartment. Your neighbors will hate you if you turn the bass nob slightly above the minimum. If you turn it to the maximum I imagine they will call the police (and you will lose your hearing). The sub-woofer is just obnoxious, that's the best word I have for it. It weighs about 30 lbs and comes with its own heat sink.There is a buzzing sound when no music is playing. It's annoying enough that I turn it off when I'm not playing anything.One satellite speaker broke after a few months of light usage. I'm currently working with Logitech warranty and thankfully, this model is discontinued so they might send me a different model as replacement.The only redeeming feature is the sound quality. Even with the bass turned all the way down, the sound coming out is great, but expected from a >$100 set."
2,"Terribly Disappointed - And No, I Don't Work For A Competitor","I bought these because of what seemed like good reviews and very good pricing. What a mistake. They offer muffled, muddy, boomy sound. All they do well is that they are loud. I got rid of them within a week, giving them away, and simply taking a loss. Their replacement, the Bose Companion 3, Series II, cost $249, but was worth every penny. If you want good, clean, crisp sound, don't buy these speakers."
3,A bit dissapointed,This speaker system is certainly powerful but it is really lacking the midrange. Also the sub/bass is a bit sloppy even for being ported. Might sound better if you swap out the satalites for something more capable of playing midrange.
1,Not worth it,"These speakers have decent mid range sound. The bass is flat and boomy, not tight at all. I previously had klipsch pro-media and they were many many times better. I wish the klipsch's lasted longer than 8 years..I would have never made the mistake of buying these."
5,Insane,"I normally do not write reviews of products; however, this set of 2.1 speakers is absolutely astonishing. The bass is so strong and clear that you would be scared to turn all the settings to the maximum. Unlike most 2.1 speakers the sound is extremely vibrant when turned up very loud."
3,Not a bad set of speakers for the price!,"These are a good set of speakers with a heavy bass! Clarity is 'fair' at most - Ok for music, Better for movies."
2,"Average Speakers , Over Priced and Over Rated !","I am not sure why this speakers so highly rated on Amazon or on CNET. I purchased them, thinking sound will be clear and crisp but I am very disappointed with these expensive and average speakers. I regret this purchase.There is no midrange and all you hear is big boomy bass from subwoofer. If you lower the subwoofer, you will realize that you paid too much for these speakers. I tried all the Settings with my Creative Platinum Sound card but nothing impressed me.This is my last logitech purchase, I guess. I have altec lansing speakers on other PC and clearly you hear the difference as how crisp and clean sound those have."
4,All You Need to Rock Your Office !,"I'm not an audiophile, but built-in speakers or low-end computer speakers leave me feeling ""meh"". After much online research, the Z-2300 seemed to be a good value, and I've not been disappointed. If you have an office desk with a return attached, you'll easily find a home for the subwoofer underneath. The controller is easy to hide on your desk and other speakers look great. Note: make sure you check the specs on the lengths of the cords.This setup is probably more than you really need to achieve high-quality music in your office, but it's particularly fun when you're the only one in and feel like cranking your favorite tunes. This system isn't the latest, smallest or least expensive option, but it's a good value and works well in the right environment."
4,Price gone way up!!,I know these speakers are good but does anyone know why they have shot up in price!! Ive seen them in the low $100.s just a few months ago!! Im trying to make more space and move from a 5.1 to 2.1 setup but wow not for $400.
4,Excellent Speakers for the Price,"If you have the room for the large sub-woofer, these speakers compare favorably to Bose and the HK Soundsticks (w/o the alien blue glo). Add to that the great price and these speakers are a great value.Give it a couple of hours of play time to get the bass on the subwoofer fully broken in."
3,Logitech Z-2300,"I enjoyed these speakers for a while until they broke. The bass is the best part of the system and I was blown away by how it performs. I've had a lot of problems with the satellite speakers, the first ones I got broke. The store I purchased these from were very good in the way they handled my concern for the speakers. They sent me two new speakers free of charge and they were great. The thing is that the speakers are following the route of my first ones and one of them is already losing sound. I plan on calling them back just to let them know that these speakers are not long lasting in any way. The store I bought them from were great but the product was not too good."
2,Quality Control Issues,"The system was awesome for the first 5 minutes, and then the right speaker stopped working. Very disappointed with the quality of the product. Will be contacting Logitech support, hopefully they can replace the speaker/system."
5,Great Buy,I orignially planned on spending a lot more money on Bose speakers but my boyfriend suggested this speaker system; same components for a lot less money. The sound quality is great and the sub works out awsome at parties. I've had them for about a month and I have no complaints!
1,Poor Reliability,The reliability of these speakers is poor. The left speaker failed after 6 months and the right after 10 months. The left replacement speaker failed after 5 months. I have soured on logitech.
1,Sounds great.......if your'e deaf.,"Sorry, 40 watts per channel at 10% THD just doesn't cut it for a quality audio product. Too bad they don't tell you about the 10% THD part until you BUY THEM and read the specifications. I listened to these for about an hour, playing a variety of music CD's and just couldn't take it anymore. I should have known better to expect quality sound from speakers at this price. Sorry Logitech, if this is the best you can do, it's not good enough. Kudos to Amazon! They took them back and refunded my money quickly. I'll gladly buy more stuff in the future, just not these speakers."
1,Too Bass,"As my previous Logitech Z5300e, this Z2300e has the same problem.The bass is too loud and it bothers too much.I controlled the sound card, the equalizer and even that it was too loud.No clear voices.I returned the Z5300e speakers.And this Z2300e speaker I will change for Bose companion 2. I tested it and I can appreciate the difference.If you like a deafening bass you can buy this Z2300e Speakers."
1,The sub looked USED,"I purchased these Logitechs for a relative of mine. When we opened the box to set them up I immediately noticed a large scuff mark on top of the sub. It appeared to be used. I don't know if it was a refurb or a return, but it sure looked used. I am very disappointed with this. I recently purchased a Linksys router for the same relative and it had scratches on the top of it. The ""install the software first warning sticker"" that normally is covering the ports was off and stuck to the inside of the product literature. Someone also had scribbled on the product literature with a black permanent marker. I am not happy about this. I expect more from Amazon. A new item does not look like this. This is the second time in a few months this has happened to me with a purchase coming directly from Amazon."
1,blown in 2 wks,"Logitech Z-2300 THX-Certified 200-Watt 2.1 Speaker System (Silver)left speaker worked poorly and shortly stopped working. return process complicated and lengthy. i am not a metalhead but like indy rock played loudly. even at [...] and free ship, this was a waste"
1,Garbage,"I bought these speakers a few days ago from Newegg, they arrived DOA. I plugged in the remote to the sub-woofer, plugged the sub into the outlet, and nothing came on. I flipped the switch on the sub and the remote multiple times and nothing would come on, I even tried plugging them into different outlets. I called Newegg for a refund RMA, packed the speakers up and sent them back. I since then researched the problem with these speakers and found out the wired remote is very cheap and breaks easily, Logitech does not sell replacements. Avoid these speakers at all costs.I am now looking at the M-Audio AV30 speakers, which sound far superior to the Z-2300, and for that matter any PC speakers on the market."
5,Daughter loves them,"These speakers are awesome sounding. My daughter has them in her room so she can play music from her computer , and ipod.You could use these in a home theater setup also."
5,Superb,"Arguably the BEST 2.1 speakers I have heard (and I have heard a lot). Bought my self one of the Creative Labs I-Trigue L3800 2.1 PC Speaker System for less than half the price but returned it the next day - the Creative ones look stunning but are almost mute compared to the Z-2300!The Z-2300 may be a bit to ""bassy"" for some but then there is a bass control rigt there on the remote console! so whats the fuss all about!I definitely am an audiophile and these speakers handle anything that you throw at them - Karsh Kale, Nitin Sawhney, Metallica, Floyd ... no problem.Yes - sub-woofer is quite large - but hey - if you want good sound then the sub-woofer WILL be large! Unless you're more of a ""looks"" person and don't care much for sound!If you want a GOOD 2.1 and don't mind spending 75-100 bucks ... BUY THESE!"
5,Awesome Speakers,I have bought these speakers through amazon and I 200% satisfied with the speakers. I got the best set of speakers for the best price. Its really worth it to have such a damn good speakers for 60$...The sound quality is really awesome. Also the BASS is excellant. The sub woofer is extra-ordinary. I am afraid of increasing the volume to the peak level coz that would blast my apartment. I would suggest any one who wants to buy a speakers. This is the best deal
3,cosi-cosi,well to start things off they are good speakers if you are just learning about the speaker world and the things that go on. but basically if you want something with rich sound and has relatively good quality pick these. they are actually pretty loud. if you get an audigy 4 soundcard like i did it increases the quality greatly. but if you want something with a little more bang for your buck i would choose the logitech -5500. trust me they are well worth the money i just bought them from amazon because i blew out my z2300's. i had them for about 6 months before they blew but most people dont listen to music as loud as i do for such long periods of time. so over all these are a good speaker choice
5,Excellent bass sound with very good mid range and highs,"I received the Logitech Z-2300 on a Friday afternoon. The shipment came from Dell in a brown box, and inside was the beast. It was not much inside except what I desired. I installed it as soon as I got opened the box.After installation, which was a breeze, I turned up the sound with some dance music with deep bass. The bedroom started to shake shook from the vibration of the subwoofer. I adjusted the sub to get the sound I wanted and it was crystal clear from that point. I found the speakers to have excellent deep bass, decent mid range, and great highs. The sound is actually pretty balanced to me, but then again I am not an expert. I just know what I like.Way to go Logitech."
5,awesome bass response for a small system,"possible the best 2.1 system you can buy for your computer. games come to life, and music sounds rich and full with a larger than average subwoofer."
2,These get old fast.,I had these speakers for three months and was tricking myself into believing the hype. There is no balance between the tweeters and the ridiculously large subwoofer (it weighs 30 pounds!) I found myself turning down the bass all the way and constantly fiddling with the equalizer. I could never get the sound to mesh and always had what sounded like tin cans on my desk and a monster somewhere in the room. The listening experience gets tiring because of the poor range and if you consider yourself interested in Music at all these speakers will disappoint. Try and find an alternative that is more balanced with regards to Treble and Bass. Good luck on the search because it should not stop here.
2,very disappointing,"Cant beat price. good sound quality. When the unit died and could not be repaired I was offered a replacement which was worth about 50% the cost of the original. I had bought ""square Deal"" warranty, got full refund."
3,"Decent, but far from the best","I bought this during Amazon's gold box deal for ~$80.I've bought Logitech accessories several times in the past and have not been disappointed.The design of these speakers are nice. I love the little volume controller design as well as the speakers and amp. The wiring is nice and sturdy as well.As far as sound quality goes, it's okay, but has some blemishes.The sound is great at high volumes with the power of the amp. However, my one BIG annoyance with this product is the fact that controlling volume at medium levels is really frustrating. I have hurt my ears on a couple of occasions trying to adjust the volume from low to medium. For a company as amazing as Logitech, I would think they would have seem this design flaw, but apparently they didn't.In terms of value, I would rather pay $150 for another brand of speakers. Only get these if you're on a budget and find a good deal."
4,bang for the buck,bass is little high which eats away the medium highs. But overall a great buy for just $80.Dont have any problems so far(>1 month) with the hardware .
3,If you don't like overwhelming bass these speakers are not for you,"If you don't like overpowering, sometimes overwhelming bass then these speakers are not for you. Other reviews are right - there is very little mid range. There is a bass knob on the remote but even if you turn it all the way down, the bass is overwhelming. I am using them for my computer monitor so I can get by with their performance. If I try to play music, I get annoyed. I should have sent them back but the restock charge for opened merchandise and shipping cost, I may as well keep them."
4,Just about roght!,"If you need as I did a top setup with a Velicity Micro desktop with a 26 Samsung monitor you do need top quality sound for anything you want to experience with full realism, go for it!"
5,I bought a second one for the house,I needed better computer speakers and was thinking of taking the computer with music and speakers to parties. This one has plenty of volume and sound quality! So now I bought a second set for the computer at the house. Nuff said.
3,Great with a few hickups,Not much to say.. we all know that these speakers are great. There are only two problems that I find:1. There are no grooves on the dials making turnng the dials on the volume/bass control a little irritating2. The Bass does not go completely mute unlike in the homologous Bose speakers. So if you want to listen to music without much base so as to not disturb people in adjacent rooms you'll have to simply turn down the volume. Something that could have been prevented had the provision to turn bass completely down been made.
4,Great Bass But Not If Are Tight On Space,"This was a gift purchase for my 19 year old son. It was a toss up between the Logitech Z-2300 and the JBL SoundSticks II. The Logitech were about $10 more than the JBL, but my son was looking for strong bass output - and believe me, the subwoofer on the Logitech delivers tons of bass. The downside is the subwoofer is big (about a 15"" cube) and heavy (maybe 30 pounds), so if you are tight on space or need to place it on a weak shelf, be forewarned. Overall, I personally prefer the sound of the JBL Soundsticks. They have a nice, crisp midrange, very good vocal reproduction and enough bass for my taste, but as I said the purchase was for a 19 year old so enough said. Manufacturing quality is very good and set up was a snap. The wired remote with volume and bass adjustment is a great feature, too."
5,Best Computer Speakers available!,I read tons of reviews before I purchased these to see if they were actullay as good as everyone was raving about. They are awesome and then some. These speakers come close to the loudness and quality of my home speaker set. Great to use on your computer and have your mp3's run through as a jukebox. Great purchase for the price.
4,...,"fast shipping. relatively cheap for new set of speakers. good sound + bass. big woofer. however, this is my first set of speakers. just alright on the game rtcw."
5,This system is impressive!!!!!!!!,"No sooner that I had gotten my new speakers than I fired them up and the sound that came out was just out of this world!!!! unlike other speaker systems I've had, at full volume and bass, there are no distortions and the sub woofer has a deep clean sound. I got a used one and up to this point don't believe that it had been used!!! i just love it...great buy to me!!!!!"
5,Great Sound,The speakers arrived safely and as advertised. Installation didn't take too long and we are rewarded by great sound!
5,Logitech Z-2300 2.1 Speaker System.........Fantastic!!!,"Wow!!! was I suprised at the quality and quantity of sound that comes from this system!!! The big subwoofer rattles the house but I was amazed that the seemingly small satelites fill the room with sound! And good, distortion free sound it is. The remote volume control is a wonderful extra feature that I wouldn't want to be without now. Installing the system was a breeze---painless wiring. And no big power converter things hanging on your surge protection strip. Definitely turns your PC into a music machine!!!....The BIG subwoofer could double as a lamp stand, I suppose."
3,Good sound quality,"Pro:I love the external design and convenience built into this system. The wired remote, that's included, has plenty of cord length so you don't have to lean over the top of your desk to access it. There are two knobs, one for volume and one for bass, and an on/off button with a tiny LED indicator light so you'll know at a glance if they're powered up or not. The remote also has a built in jack for headphones which is great. I doubt that any sane person would ever play these full press inside their house because they're just that loud. Very powerful.Cons:None"
5,Awsome!,Great sounding speakers. Volume control is very convenient. If you are looking for a great three piece speaker system this is what you want! I really wanted an easy/clean installing 3 speaker system because I didn't want to place 5 for more speakers and run wires over the place.
5,Amazing,"If you're looking for good speakers these are the ones to get. Compared them to my brothers Klipsch Promedia 2.1's and they sound just as good if not better. Amazing bass. If you're looking at the Z623 as well, get the Z2300. The Z2300 are made of much higher quality, I've read alot of bad reviews about the Z2623's saying that they in no way compare to the Z2300's. Totally worth the price. Might look into getting a speaker extension cable though. The satellites come with pretty short cables."
4,Good speakers for the price,"I have had these speakers for about one month and have been happy with them. The bass is very good, I usually put it on the lower setting. I dont know all that much about speakers but these sure sound good to me in our 12 x 12 office."
5,Just Buy Them,"I was blown away by how well such an inexpensive speaker system sounded! When I first hooked them up, I planned on taking a couple of minutes just to get a sense of their sound quality. An hour later I was still picking songs out of my library to hear them on these speakers. Video game play is taken to a higher level of pleasure as well! I have never ""test driven"" some of the more expensive speakers I came across, but I do not feel the need. I am very picky when it comes to sound quality and I am quite satisfied with this speaker system. Only draw back (not even a complaint) is the short speaker wires. Plan on a trip to Radio Shack for some extension cables (I think I got a couple of 6 footers for under $10) so you can position the satellite speakers for optimal listening...then sit back and enjoy!"
5,Good sound,"I bought these speakers to use with my computer and to plug my iPod into. I also use these speakers with my projector when showing movies. The speakers are loud and the sub actually puts out pretty good bass for such a small speaker. There could be an iPod dock, but overall I'm happy with my purchase."
5,Awesome,"After reading reviews and doing other research, I purchased this system for my son who is a freshman in college. He is absolutely thrilled with it. The sound is clean and loud! He can't really crank it up in his dorm room, but he brought it home over the holiday break and it is just plain awesome (his word). Great price, great sound, great system."
5,Wonderful,"It simply works! Logitech's website actually rates this higher than many of the higher-end more expensive 2.1 system set-ups, and I can see why customers love this. The perfect price for such an amazing woofer/speaker combo! Great sound quality, and the bass'll bring a tear to your eyes."
2,Perfect if you don't care about mid range.,"I gave these speakers the benefit of the doubt due to all the glowing five star reviews. The other reviewers were right, these speakers completey lack mid range. I am very particular with audio because I am a musician and somewhat of an audiophile, I figured these would be on the same level as lower priced studio monitors, was I wrong. In all fairness, the bass sounds pretty good but I need to be able to hear a balance of everything."
2,failed after 6 months,"Speakers sounded amazing at first.. I was very pleased with the sound quality . . But after about 6 Months the left speaker started to sound funny. Then after 7 months the left speaker totally stopped working.. So after messing around and plugging the left speaker into the right speaker input i realized that the speaker sounds fine. . It is the input on the back of the subwoofer, not the speaker that is the root of the problem. It just totally stopped sending sound. total crap."
2,AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THERE ARE NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE THE AMESOME MIGHT OF THESE SPEAKERS. EVERY SONG I LISTEN TO IS LIKE HEARING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME. THERE ARE SO MANY BEAUTIFUL DETAILS IN THE MUSIC WHICH I COULD NEVER HEAR UNTIL NOW. NOT TO MENTION, THESE SPEAKERS ARE LOUD ENOUGH TO FILL MY ENTIRE 3 BEDROOM APARTMENT WITH BEAUTIFUL SOUND, NOT TO MENTION SHAKE THE WALLS .Here's a tip: If the bass is too loud for you, turn the bass dial all the way down on the remote and turn the bass down a little on your computer equalizer. That should do the trick and also prevent your neighbor's from trying to kill you.UPDATE: I changed this review from 5 stars to 2 stars. About a year after purchase, one of the speakers started buzzed whenever I play loud music. It makes it annoying and distracting. It' still under 2 year warranty, but it's a pain to ship to them so I haven't gotten it fixed yet."
1,Spiral binding is NOT a good idea for little fingers...,"I'm giving this book 1 star with great sadness because my 13-month-old loves it. However, the spiral binding is a terrible idea. We have some of the other Priddy Bicknell books, and they've held up just fine. For 13 months, she's actually very careful. But even adults have some problems with spiral bindings (think of those photo albums with pages starting to tear out), so it was no great surprise when some of the pages ripped. And because of the binding, you can't tape them back in. If you want to read this with your child, fine, but what kid doesn't want to turn the pages herself?? Either plan to replace this---FREQUENTLY---or buy some of the other Priddy books instead."
4,big word book-1000 first words,"My 2 year old son really loves this book, there are A LOT of things to look at and it pretty much covers all the basic words and then some. He can use this book until he is 5 years old. I like this book because it has stuff in it that you actually see everyday. Other books have complicated words or show items that are not everyday things. The only complaint I have is that the pages tear easily since the book is wire bound, otherwise I would of given it 5 stars. Definitely a great book to teach your little one his/her first words!"
4,Great Book,"My son who is almost 2 loves this book. It is his absolute favorite. He loves all the pictures and people and animals in it. The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating was because it is spiral bound, my son rips the pages. I wish it would be hard cover like the other books in the series. I have only had the book for a couple of weeks and have had to tape it several times. Other than that, we LOVE this book!"
2,Not very tolerable...,"I really wanted to like this product, but La Roche-Posay has disappointed me over the last year (has there been an ingredient switch?) This lotion was drying on me, and it gives me a cyst for every couple of days of use. On the other hand, it is great for minimizing pores, so I think this would be a nice pre-foundation cream for anyone who can use this without breaking out."
4,"Like it, too expensive","I like this product. However, I have champagne skin care taste on a beer budget. It's too expensive for me to purchase on a regular basis. If you can afford the price, it's great stuff. Wears well under makeup, doesn't get greasy and you can wear it to bed at night. Pricey and worth it."
5,amazing product for very sensitive skin,"I bought this when i ran out of my normal moisturiser and i have no regrets.I have combination sensitive oily skin. It moisturises well but doesn't leave a shine or sit on top of the skin. The lotion is rich enough to properly hydrate my skin, especially my cheeks and eyes which are sometimes dry. I no longer need to buy an eye cream."
2,"Poor packaging, so wasteful","Great cream, love it, and would give 5 stars, but halfway through, it gets difficult to push out the product. It's true of all their products in this hard plastic tube--PLEASE change the packaging material to a softer one!"
1,Yawn,"This story was an incredible yawn. At it's best, it's a imaginative try at shoving religion down the reader's throat. ""Stephen King"" would enjoy? I think not. Save your 20 bucks and spend it on something more interesting, like a block of cheese. Also, I am fully aware by reading the newspaper when this book was first published, that Jim McLean is her husband. Nice try."
2,NOT a karaoke disc,I ordered this disc thinking that it was karaoke..... it is NOT. More like performance tracks. It comes with a paper insert with the words printed for you. The vocal tracks were pretty good. Be careful !!!
5,Review for Management of Organizational Behavior,"The seller of this book did an excellent job with packaging and sending the book promptly. It was in very good condition, just as I was told it would be.Thank you!"
4,"Good, inexpensive reference material","This book describes and displays the various uniforms of the German Heer -- but not Luftwaffe, Kriegsmarine, SS or any of the various paramiltary organizations -- from pre-war (1935) to the end of the Blitzkrieg (1940) in good detail. Be warned: The book is NOT a comprehensive catalog of uniforms and heraldry and will be of pretty limited use to the militaria collector. There are 40 b&w photos and eight color plates along with four tables describing orders of dress, ranks, and insignia. The photos are a mix of action shots and posed portraits. The 24 full-color uniforms depicted in the color plates are accompanied by text describing the uniform and the equipment worn by the soldiers. Many service branches are represented from infantry and engineers to Panzertruppen to signals and Feldgendarmert ... It's a good deal of information at a great price. I recommend it to beginning scale modelers looking for inexpensive and accurate reference materials."
3,"Nice Color Plates, but......","The color plates are great, but the editing and accuracy of the rank charts is horrible. You would think they would have corrected their errors a long time ago."
5,"More expensive than other translations, but priceless in material","What can I say? The 5 stars average reviews are true.Marcus Aurelius, the last of the ""good"" five emperors, left a work that has survived the centuries. The translations by the Hicks brothers relates his wisdom to the 21st century audience. I have read 5 other translations and this one is the most expensive, but the most easily understandable.It would be a good gift for all ages. Would serve as an excellent."
5,Stoicism for the 21st Century,"This is the fourth translation of Marcus Aurelius' guidebook I have bought, and by far the most accessible, understandable, and applicable to life as I find it.The 1945 Classics Club revision of George Long's earlier translation is more elaborate, but the brothers Hicks have made Marcus more relevant to our times.I have filled three index cards with quotes from ""The Emperors Handbook"" and propped them around my work computer. My favorite: ""I do what is expected of me and let nothing get in my way - neither the inanimate, nor the irrational, nor the hopelessly lost.""Buy two copies of this book: One for home, one for work, and thus ""have before you at all times the icon of an ancient who practiced virtue."""
5,THE BEST !,"I have read several translations of this great work..and without a doubt this is the finest available. What makes this the best is its ability to seem both classical and modern at the same time..in other words its not overly stuffy--nor is it distorted into ""New Age"" drivle. Don't think twice about buying this..you won't be dissapointed."
3,not for young children,"This Eyewitness video, like the couple others we have viewed with our preschoolers, is interesting for us adults, but not at all entertaining enough for young children. Too much talking! Not enough action! <G>The cover shows a wooly mammoth, but I don't remember seeing a mammoth in the video, unless I was distracted by one of the kids at just that moment. I guess when I think of prehistoric times I think of cave men and sabre tooth tigers and wooly mammoths, not the beginnings of the earth. This video covers the whole of prehistory, all 4.5 billion years of it, in 1/2 hour. So not much time is devoted to the subjects we are familiar with or that kids are interested in. A lot of time is spent on the ""primordial soup"" stage ...And the entire dinosaur age is covered in about 10 seconds, showing just 1 of the many species. But I do recommend the video to more mature audiences who are interested in a brief overview of the developments during those 4.5 billion years."
1,It was well written but....,"Clay Evans has a very well written tale here. Tale being the key word here. Although I can not account for all of his stories I can account for the ones that took place in my hometown. Some of the portrayals of people I know and have known my entire life are innacurate and down right offensive in many respects. His opinion of a lifestyle I was raised in and continue to be a part of is one of someone who totally missed the mark in his short lived experience with ""The Life."" It's not only offensive to the people it's writtewn about but to anyone who has chosen the lifestyle he so wrongly describes. But if you are looking for a well written book of tales, then read it, but if you are looking for an accurate representaion of a true way of life, pass this one by."
5,"Becoming a Cowboy --- Myths Explored, Truths Told","Clay's book really gives a good look at how a young man not born into the cowoby life becomes a cowboy through his own determination and hard work. I felt his exuberance over hard ranch work, learning the cowboy skills and the thrill of finally being recognized as a ""real"" cowboy because of his hard-earned skills and accomplishments. He painted a realistic look at modern ranching and cowboying and explores the myths and realities. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the cowboy life, ranching, horses and riding. For an in-depth look at ranching through the eyes of a 40-year old man who had the same cowboy dreams as Clay, I'd highly recommend The Cowboy Way by David McCumber."
5,"from Boulder, CO",I loved the book. It made me understand the struggles within a grown up boy who had everything and just wanted to experience life at its fullest and chose being a cowboy. Clay's talent is how he sees things a little different and is able to describe them on paper and make you say oh yeah!
4,Cowboy life as it really is,"This book begins slowly. As a matter of fact, my husbaand who knows how to rope and has been in a rodeo was so bored as he read the first 40 or so pages that he quit reading it. I kept on, and after Clay got on his first horse, everything (including him!) took off! By the time I finished the book, I was impressed with the depth of his feelings about himself, his cowboy experiences, and his future. I feel like a better person for having read Clay's story and am looking forward to more things by him. I was impressed that he learned to write quite by accident when he took a writing class in college to complete units for graduation. His teacher was one of those rare ones who encouraged him! We all need that kind of encouragement."
2,Garbage....,"Look at this guys album cover, its pretty obvious he dosnt take his music seriously. Musically his voice is terrible and his rhymes are decent but sometimes weak, being on Psychopathic he mentions hatchets like every other verse. Guest appearances are no different from anything else on Psy, Blaze Ya Dead Homie, Twiztid, Insane Clon Posse and believe it or not underground rapper Paris on the track ""Ghetto Neighbors"". Other Noteable Tracks are ""Sticky Icky Situations"" which sprise suprise is about smoking weed. Esham did a great job but Blaze and Violent J were weak. Then theres ""In The City"" which is an Eagles cover. Word to the wise, if you're trying to convince your fan base your a horrorcore gangster, dont cover The Eagles. So juggalos will say this review didn't help them but it dosnt matter because this is a real review. If your a juggalo youll like it, if you're an average rap fan, don't buy it, its terrible and is basically rock."
2,Esham is best thing about this album,"Esham is the best thing on this album. He shreds a nice long verse in Sticky Icky Situation. ABK has a really bad lisp. I don't think ABK has the skills to be a staying power on Psy. He will become a guest artist exlusively on Blaze's projects. It's nice to have a new Psy album, but they could have tightened up alot of the hooks."
1,"Typical ""Juggalo"" release","This, to me, is just another ... addition from another ICP protégé. Twiztid is the only other Psychopathic artist I have any respect for. At least their first release, Mostasteless, was uninfected by the ""juggalo"" sound. Artists like Blaze, Zug Izland, and the most current, ABK, just seem to be nothing more than protégés of ICP. Blaze's and ABK's raps are so simple and redundant they just insult the intelligence of the listener. Basically, about this album, all you need is to download one song and play it over and over again and you'll get the album. Here's an example that prooves ABK, like Blaze and Zug, is completely influenced by ICP. He has a song on this album called ""Your Neden's Haunted."" The word neden is a word ICP came up with. The artists on Psychopathic really need to get their own style. Personally, I think every album released by Psychopathic doesn't have anything to do with the particular artist, it's just shameless self promotion by ICP."
4,4.25 STARS,"This album is really good. It took me a while to get used to it, but once I did, i really liked this album. Some of my favourite songs are ""Kill Me"", ""Hated Me"", ""If You Don't Know"" & ""Gang Related"". I recommend this to all juggalos, but i recommend that you buy a Dark Lotus album before you buy an ABK solo album to get a bit of a taste of ABK's style, because alot of people seem to dislike ABK's style.MCL.Jono"
3,"Good movie, decent DVD","Maverick is a very funny update of the vintage western. Mel Gibson is a pleasure to watch as lucky-go-happy cardshark Brett Maverick, and his coupling with southern belle Jodie Foster is a very good one. James Garner, the original Maverick, is a hoot as a marshall. Look for funny parts by James Coburn, Graham Greene and a familiar face from Lethal Weapon. The DVD itself is decent. Picture and sound are good, extras are non existent (unless pan & scan counts as an extra). Well worth picking up if you like any of the players."
2,Western Light: Too Light,"I rented this film after being impressed by James Garner's portrayal of Woodrow F Call in Streets of Laredo. Most of the cast seem to be having a great time but too many jokes fall flat. Neither Gibson and Foster seem to have a clue playing Western characters. Like Billy Crystal in City Slickers with none of the irony. The film is lighthearted with chuck wagon loads of old TV western cliches. Guns being shot off peoples hands, Mel rescuing a run-away stagecoach, and a Royal Flush winning hand. Yawn. (Which shows how brilliant Spielberg was in Raiders of the Lost Ark, bringing a fresh variation to a tired action sequence.) Its all done by the numbers with no inspiration. If you're looking for a film about clever slight of hand and humourous double crosses you're better off watching The Sting with Newman and Redford.The movie was a great re-union of old TV western stars, country singers, and modern actors. I wish they remembered to make a movie worth renting."
2,The movie rocks but the DVD [doesn't]!!,"Now don't get me wrong, the movie was great. Good acting by all and great casting. The cast always appears to be genuinely having fun throughout the movie. The script was the backbone of the movie and made this one of the best comedy / westerns ever.However, the DVD real stinks. There are no extras except for a few production notes which are all written. I expected a lot more from such a wonderful movie.The 2 stars are for the DVD not the movie."
2,A stinker,"This is a two star stinker. We were promised hilarity, and all we got was smirking, a very thin story, and excessive length. Either a film is a put-on or not, and this movie could not quite make up its mind. The comedy bits fall extremely flat, and the violence is just plain nasty, as is some of the language. In short, a complete waste of time that does nothing for the reputation of Gibson and Foster."
5,maverick,"it is the funniest movie iv'e seen in a long time,it is just great,i watch it at least 2 or 3 times a day,i will recomened to any body."
5,Still funny,"I find this movie as funny now as when it first came out. Mel Gibson, James Garner and Jodie Foster are completely charming and wonderful to watch. It is simply a good time for a couple of hours. Not deep. Not thought provoking. Just a good time and a good chuckle."
5,Top Notch Entertainment,"This is an excellent movie. I bought it for my husband, but I have to admit I truly enjoy it too. This is one of the best comedic westerns around! It has a great plot that keeps you guessing right up until the end!"
5,"Good quality, arrived quickly.",No complaints. Good disk even thought it was used. Shipped fast. I would buy from you again.
4,Maverick,fun time in the old west. Gibson is fine as Maverick. Great to see James Garner in a western setting again.
3,A Western Comedy,"MAVERICK is based on the old television series of the same name, and follows Mel Gibson's character in an attempt to win a huge poker gambling prize. However, a lawman (played by James Garner) and a feisty femme (Jodie Foster) end up getting in his way.This is a fun comedy that has its tongue firmly in cheek. I didn't know of the series, so can't say how authentic it is. However, I did think that quite a few of the jokes were either stale or fell flat.The plot's interesting enough - particularly the twists and turns and plotting that goes on. However, this isn't sufficient to keep interest going and despite the high energy pacing of MAVERICK, it ultimately failed to keep me amused."
2,"""Maverick""--horrible DVD transfer","My review is limited to the picture and sound quality of the DVD transfer. The movie itself is fine--great cast, very funny--5 stars for the movie, 0 stars for the DVD quality. The transfer of this film to DVD is one of the worst that I have seen! The picture quality is quite poor, very grainy and almost out of focus. It seems that it was copied from a VHS version of the movie. The movie was made in 1994--it's not that old! This otherwise good movie deserves much better treatmenet than this."
4,"Funny movie, disappointing end...","The opening line of ""Maverick"" is sure to be one quoted in Movie Trivia games worldwide. I thought the movie was, mostly, outrageously funny, full of wit and on the whole a very entertaining movie. I was disappointed, and at first befuddled, by the constant double-crossing, right up to the last bath scene. One was reminded of the old movie ""The Sting"". And the ending was disappointing, almost leaving a call for a Maverick II. But so far, no results. Mel Gibson and Jodie Foster are great actors (remember Ransom and Silence of the Lambs?) and together made this a very entertaining movie - for most of the time. My opinion - almost there, but not there yet - 4 stars..."
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"I hate westerns and that's why I'd actually never seen this Richard Donner directed, western about a con man before. To be honest, it had everything you'd expect to see in a Richard Donner film, including a terrific cameo by Danny Glover. It was a little predictable at times, but the ending was classic. I also loved the scenery and costume design. Overall it was a pretty good movie. If I had one desire, it would be that the movie was a little more edgy, but other than that it was a great film. Mel Gibson was very likable, shame that's only the case on the big screen huh?"
3,Grainy PIX,"I bought this as a replacement because my Maverick DVD had a grainy picture.This one is grainy, also.I guess I can't improve on it."
4,Spectacular,"Maverick as Western based action comedy is simply excellent. Its starcast also adds to the success of the hollywood blockbuster. The movie is so realistically filmed that it at times doesn't seem like a 90's movie at all. It looks exactly like the movies The Good, the bad and the ugly and Fistfull of Dollars only even better. The animatronic rattle snakes used in the movie look completely realistic and life like. However, there are a few draw backs few of them can be noted. One is the make up for Alfred Molina. He does not look anything like himself. I agree that he is the bad guy but please not that bad. And Jodie Foster's making her escape with the money is completely inappropriate. Now that both of them play theives instead of outwitting each other their characters should team up."
4,"Ideal Family Film, especially for boys of all ages","I have two grandsons, 8 and 12. I wanted a family film we could all watch. Maverick filled the bill. In spite of a fairly complicated plot, there is no lull in the action, the comedy relaxes any tension and the surprise ending is priceless. A good choice for Movie Nite at home."
5,good movie,"good nice feel good movie and some good acting as well.it will keep you engaged , worth the money"
4,Fresh Fall air (and airs) in Eire,"Autmunal images (seared orange, pale yellow and green leaves), meditative paens to nature's harmonious beauty and God's love, musical notations on being a solitary human being in a large and sometimes difficult world, a rootsy and jaunty celtic instrumental. ""Pastoral and low key"" would be some of the surest adjectives to describe ""A Sense of Wonder;"" ""soulfully soothing and occassionally enthralling"" would be my humble critique. There is a wonderful and rare spiritual cohesiveness and harmony to this delightful, deceptively modest album that is rare to find or even stumble upon in any period. You can smell the leaves on the air.A Sense of Wonder qualifies"
4,Aptly named,"While not quite achieving the same pinnacle as (say) ""No Guru ..."", this is still a very fine album. Van is at the peak of his form vocally, and, as usual, his collaborators are superb musicians. The title tune is lovely, and ""What Would I Do Without You"" is heartfelt without being sentimental. And the version of ""Boffyflow and Spike"" on this album has a jazzy ""flow"" that's missing from the livelier (but still delightful) traditional-instruments version he does with the Chieftains on ""Irish Heartbeat."" I found ""Let The Slave"" rather weak, not because of the material or the melody, but because Morrison's diction isn't quite up to it at times. His ventures into mysticism (e.g., ""The Master's Eyes"") are well done but tend to be repetitious. And what's with that Zorro suit he wears on the cover? But, overall, I like the album a lot."
1,Avoid this,"Motorhead collectors should steer clear of this one. It is the 1982 Toronto Maple Leaf Gardens concert, I believe, purposefully mislabled as being a Canadian concert from 1988.Any idiot would know that Fast Eddie was long gone from the band by 1988. Yet, there he is playing guitar for them, but the year is 1982.This was a disappointment. The packaging is an outright lie."
5,the one and only,"For those of us who like to hang out in the severe cold--skiiers, snowshoe-ers, winter runners, ice fishermen, etc. You know who you are. And you know how the cold hurts your face. This is the one true face protector. It's heavy but not greasy, and it won't clog your pores."
1,same old same old,"I downloaded the audiable version of this book because it was listed under comedy. It is not a comedy. I didn't laugh at all. It is the same as most dateing books. Basically I can sum the entire book as this, Be your self don't fake who you are or lie, and honestly ask for what you want. That in my mind isn't a bitch that is assertive and honest."
3,"Sort of obvious advice, occasionally funny.","I thought this would be interesting to read - I'm a man - to see things from the woman's point of view. The advice seems to be obvious, often, and it's a bit superficial, but occasionally funny. I like the comment about ""fighting fair"" - don't be the ""Psycho Bitch from Hell,"" says the author."
4,David Hasselhoff,I've always liked Knight Rider and I bought this so my granddaughter could see it. She loves Kitt and sat to watch the whole set with me. I recommend.
2,Doesn't do justice to the life and science of Feynman,"I read a biography of Feynman a few years ago that was brilliant. This wasn't the one I was thinking of and I am disappointed I purchased it.I found James Gleiks writing style deadly dull, doing justice to neither Feynman as a man nor his brilliant science.Feynmans academic papers are a much better read, and 'Surely you're joking mr Feynman' is brilliant. Wish I could remember the title of the Feynman bio I loved ..."
3,Stale biography of a brilliant man.,"How do you understand a true genius ? This books' attempt left me a bit closer, but still rather unsatisfied. I read the book a couple of years ago, and found it enlightening on the beauty of maths, but picking it up again recently I found it less pleasing. I don't think the author captured the excitment of discovery well. The chapters on the Manhatten Project are excellent though."
3,"Light on life, heavy on science","The focus of the book is more on the science of Richard Feynman. Although I could follow the science, given my undergraduate studies in math and physics back in the 1970s, the detailed accounts make rather dry reading. I was hoping to see more about the life of Richard Feynman as a person."
4,Interesting biography,"Good biography. This book is about him not by him, but makes for an interesting read with a good description of how modern physics was shaping in US>"
1,One of the worst books I've ever seen.,"This book is so bad that I didn't make it past the first few pages. Another reviewer here agrees with me that this book gets off to a very bad start immediately when he says, ""I almost gave it up after the first couple chapters, but finally made it through it all.""The problem I have with this book is that the author describes events in Feynman's life in a way that could not possibly allow the reader to get a proper sense of the events. It is like he is combining different events into the same dissusion. Totally distroying the context of the events. Anyone who has read the other great Feynman books that are out there will cringe when they attempt to read this book. If you have never read a book about Feynman, do no start with this one. Start with ""Surly you're jokeing Mr. Feynman."" This book is legendary for a reason."
3,mediocre,"Gleick's biography of Feynman is certainly palatable for even non-techical readers... however, if you're interested in Feynman as a person, you're far better off reading it in Feynman's words: ""Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman""... not only was that book much funnier and an immense joy to read, but you get a much better feel for a lot of the anecdotes that are relayed again in Gleick's book.If you're interested in learning about the history of QED and Feynman's hand in its development, this book is a nice teaser, but it really doesn't go into much depth. It focuses too much on the shallow rivalries between the physicists of that time, without really making clear what the developments were or how they were developed."
5,One of my favorites,"When I was in graduate school, this book was an inspiration. It remains one of my favorite biographies. Those who criticize Gleick for not understanding the physics have not read his other books, and do not understand his unique approach to science journalism. Like an impressionist painter he gives the 'feeling' of the science, through metaphors and simple examples, and then lets those examples motivate the character and emotional life of his subject. This isn't a book about science, but about the interaction between science and scientist. It actually reaches a crescendo about halfway through, when Gleick offers his personal meditation on genius. Given his more recent biography on Newton, one can see this theme running throughout his works: what is it that elevates the scientific genius from the masses? A true masterpiece."
2,Nice Game,Game itself is good . The service to get it through Amazon was spectacular.... as always very pleased with both.
4,Racing MUST OWN,Great damage detailsGreat GameplayGreat Variety of Racing ClassesGreat explanation by pastrana (the master)Needs More vehicles (but it does have all the best ones)Mini-Games?
4,Good Game.. Attention to Detail!,"This game leaves Forza in the dust! I usually don't like racing games because they consist of the same old thing. However, this game brings more to the table. Simply the best racing game since Sega Rally! This is NOT another generic racer! You will love it! OMG = 1080p!!Geeze...so pretty..!"
2,Expected more out of this.,"I'm a big fan of Nascar, World of Outlaws, and Motocross so I'm always on the lookout for a good racing game. However, this game is mediocre at best and quickly becomes boring. The graphics are beautiful but that is about all this game has going for it. There just isn't enough head to head racing. Most of the game consists of point to point racing on empty dirt roads in time trial competitions. The truck races are my favorite but there just aren't enough of them in the game. If the game was all truck racing then I would probably like it much more. I played this game really heavy for about a week, but I quit pretty quickly after that. I just wasn't having fun. After all isn't the point of playing games having a good time? This game is boring. I'll take Mario Kart on the Super Nintendo over this any day of the week."
3,This is NOT a multi-player game,"My family is competitive and loves to play Xbox 360. It's important to me to get games with multi-player options so no-one is relegated to spectator.What a disappointment! If you own two or more joysticks or racing wheels (as I do) this game does NOT allow for side-by-side multi-player gaming.It's a great game, otherwise.. but unless you want to buy multiple Xboxes or scatter your family to the web, it's strictly one player per box."
3,THE GAME IS OK,LOOK THIS GAME IS OK I THOUGHT THAT THIS GAME WAS GOING TO BE A GREAT GAME WHEN I READ THE REVIEWS THEY MADE THIS GAME GAME SOUND GREAT BUT ITS OK I PLAY MOTOR STORM ON MY PLAY STATION 3 AND ITS A BIG DIFFERENCE BUT DIRT IS NOT THAT BAD OHH AND THAT GUY THAT TALKS IN THE GAME TALKS TOO MUCH WAY TO MUCH
1,Excellent Title-silly book,"This reminds me of a book report I turned in in 4th grade, and as I recall, I got a D-. And the ""First Report"" part of the title? Doesn't that sound like there will be at least a ""Part 2"" or ""Second Report""? Save your money...."
2,Project Blue Book: First report,"Without being too scathing, it is probably the worse book I have read. I gave up after section one because it was just like a narration of someone's work day."
3,Asteroids for Mac OS 9,"Only consider this product for your OS 8.1 - 9.2 Mac. It is not for OS X.x Macs unless you also installed the ""Classic"" version.Ignore the above ratings. Amazon wouldn't accept this ""review"" with ratings.I wasn't able to install the game as I hadn't installed the OS 9 components on my OS X Macs."
5,Amazing Jam,"This is an unusual and amazing tasting jam. I love the pear with vanilla overtones. Great on toast and my wife loves it for an unusual PB and J. The only issue is that the supplier doesn't have anymore and doesn't know when they will get more. If they had a case of it, I would buy it all- it's that great."
4,What went wrong,"THQ did a great job on the graphics and all,but hey this kind of side-scrolling games went out with the SNES."
3,Does not fit applications as Hurst says,"I bought this for a 1970 Chevrolet Pickup that I changed over to a Muncie 4-speed. Hurst lists this as a shift handle but it does not clear the seat. I will not be using, but now it's out of the vacuum sealed package so I guess I will resell and lose money."
2,Lack of content but cheap,"As someone that took both the gen chem I and II exams, I wouldn't recommend buying this because the content in the book is so condensed and what frustrated me the most was the practice questions had no explanations ...only the answers! I wish the authors would provide explanations for the practice problems. The book is relatively cheap (if you find a used copy rather than buying it off the publisher's website) so if you want some ""practice"" preparing for the ACS, buy the book but my warning is DO NOT rely on the book solely for your ACS exam"
5,Chemistry Exam Study Guide Helps!,I purchased this for my son in college and it arrived promptly and defintely helped him with the final exam.
3,fyi,"Maybe I'm missing something, but I'm not sure why this book is being sold here for $50 and up. Same thing appears to be available on the ACS website for $17."
4,Great Book! Totally Worth It!!!,"If your teacher uses the actual ACS test than you should definitely buy this book. It's totally worth it! I gave the product only four stars because of the price. The price is a bit expensive for a book but if your spending anywhere from $1000 to $1500 for your college class than heck, $40 or so is so worth it!!! And it's a very straight forward review.. helping you understand pretty much everything that'll be on the test - so long as your professor is using the actual ACS exam. Good luck everyone!!!"
4,DO YOU WANT TO PASS THE ACS FINAL?,The problems in the ACS guide here are difficult to an extent but a great review for the final. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND YOU GO THROUGH THIS BOOK AS YOU GO THROUGH THE COURSE.MADE THE ACS FINAL SEEM LIKE CAKE!
2,Not Worth It,"While this costume looks really cute, it is not made correctly. I expected more from Leg Avenue. The top will not sit right on you,and makes the whole costume look funny. The skirt is ok, just really flimsy. The only reason I even put 2 stars is because the thigh highs are really nice and sexy."
5,One of the best all-time Mac games,"I loved Doom and Doom 2 when they came out, but eventually grew tired of the 3D first-person shooter games. On a whim, I picked up Unreal Tournament, and I must say it is one of the best games I've played in years. The graphics are stunning. The single-player game is a lot of fun, with fairly-intelligent computer opponents and interesting variety of game types. Online play is a blast. Plus Mac users are able to go on the web and download all the custom made maps out there. As far as 3D shooters go, it's hard to top this. Gameplay-wise, it's a vast improvement over the original Unreal."
3,Not what I expected,"I was very disappointed with this game. Maybe this is because I had already played Half-life before I played this game. I'm always skeptical when a game is without a singleplayer mode and I doubted that it could beat the multi-player of Team Fortress classic for Half-life. While it is an ok multiplayer game it had already been far surrpassed by Half-life in single-player, multi-player, graphics, realism, as well as lasting appeal. I could not in good conscience rate this game any higher when it is obviously lacking in so many categories."
4,Unreal Problems,"I never got to play the game. I went to install it on my Mac and apparently the Classic Environment is no longer supported. I loved this game as a kid and I would love to play it again. If anyone can give me help on how i can make this game work, let me know. I have Snow Leopard as my operating system"
5,UNREAL TOURNAMENT ROX,This game is so awesome. Many weapons levels and game types. One of my fav games of all time i suggest u buy it because u can get many add-on levels from the internet so u can have countless hours of fun!
4,Good if you love this kind of street racing movie,"I've seen a lot of ""clones"" of the Fast & Furious, but this one is unique. It is way over the top and not very realistic, but still very enjoyable - almost in a parody sort of way. The premise of the movie - that a girl needs to overcome her fear of speeding, kind of lets you know how wild it is going to turn out.If I could fault anything, it would be that it seems a little cheap in places, and like a B-grade horror movie - but if it is a Horror movie, then it is like the Evil Dead...which is enjoyable in its own way."
5,Creative Zen Vision M AV TV Cable,Excellent product and quality. Connects Zen vision M to RCA inputs on TV and works flawlessly. The connector that goes into the zen snaps into place so it cannot be pulled out without pressing on each side. Highly recommended.
3,Works,"My Zen Vision:M is my baby, so I am especially wary of 'accessories' which I am not 100% sure will work with it properly and not damage it.So, I am ambilvalent about this product. I chose it because I liked the idea of not having to go through the dongle to get a video signal out to a television. But that also means that I am plugging an unknown entity into the very vital data port on my M.I will say this: It works. The fit is tight, tighter than I would like it to be, but at least it does fit, and it sends a clear signal out. Just be careful using it."
5,Worked like an antibiotic,My doctor recommended this instead of a prescription antibiotic. I took it the same length of time that I would have had to take the rx. And it worked.
3,"Charlie's good, but film quality is poor.","I always like Charlie Chaplin movies, and I've seen a few that were in decent condition. So I hoped this one would be as good. Thought maybe they re-mastered it or something when they put it on DVD. But they did not. It is scratchy and dark and hard to watch in many places. It's good be cause it IS Charlie Chaplin. But if you want some decent film quality, look around for something that's been cleaned up a little."
5,great camera,"this camera has tremendous results. all pictures have come out crystal clear... it is a bit outdated now with all digital stuff, but worked great when we bought it... now it is a cool training tool for the kids."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this, being familiar with the Travelsound 200, and was hoping I would be getting similar quality/sound with the difference being in the features. Well, I can say that the quality just isn't there. Sound distortion is evident at mid to high levels and it has some quirkiness about volume. The unit feels cheaply made too, which this whole thing is something of a surprise because the Travelsound 200 is a very nice unit, and doesn't feel cheap at all. It's like they were made in different countries or something."
4,would be very nice with AC adapter,"I bought this item for my mom because she had seen it at a friends house. She really likes it, but the lack of AC adapter is something she could live without. I looked into buying a Creative adapter, but the price I found was over twice what I paid for the actual speakers! So, needless to say, I didn't buy them.Good product overall, but it would be really nice if it came with the adapter."
4,Great Voice Quality for the Small Size,Great Voice Quality packed in a small bundle. Small Size makes it easy to carry while travelling. Would recommend to buy an universal power adaptor for home use.I have used this product for one month now...thumbs up from me. But Guys keep your expectations real based on price and size....do not expect highest voice quality at higher volumes.
2,Not their best product.,"Sound quality is ok at low volumes but speakers ""rattle"" as you turn up the volume. Bought them for both my notebook computer and cd player. Batteries go dead really fast when turned off. Very short speaker cable (3 ft). Not worth the price!"
1,Surprise!,"After reading the other reviews, I expected a serviceable product. I was not prepared for the relative richness of the sound emanating from such a compact product. Obviously, certain types of music, esp. w/heavy bass, will strain the system. If you purchase with reasonable expectations, you should be quite pleased. (I since have purchased 2 more as gifts.) Enjoy. (Incidentally, the one star should be FOUR.)"
1,UGH! These sound horrible!,"Maybe I just got a defective item, but the sound on these is almost unlistenable. I had to take them back. This surprised me, because I very much liked the low-priced computer speakers they make under the Cambridge Soundworks brand name.Go for the comparable speakers from Panasonic (RP-SPT70), which sound great and are exactly half the price! It was a choice between the Panasonics and the expensive Sony offering (which I still haven't heard), and I'm very glad I saved the money and went with the Panasonic.In any case, avoid these Creatives!"
4,rugged and good for hotel room background music,"I never watch TV at home. As soon as I get into a hotel room, however, I immediately switch the TV on. When I travel with these speakers and an MP3 player or laptop, however, I set up some background music and don't waste my life watching the Weather Channel. I've had mine on the road for more than 70 traveling days and in checked soft-ish airline bags for perhaps 10 flights. So far they are still working well.At this weight you can't expect an authentic reproduction of a 9' Steinway grand piano. But these are vastly better and louder than the speakers built into laptop computers."
3,Ok sound,The sound is pretty good. It is just a little bit better than Laptop speakers. I use it for my projector and it will be loud enough to fill a room with sound 35x35 feet. Don't expect much bass though unless you turn down the volume alot. It can run 35 hours on battery which I think is really good.
3,Mobile Air Cooler,"I am quite disappointed with the Windchaser Evaporative humidifier. I purchased it to cool a garage efficiency by at least 12 degrees, as stated in the product manual, and rather than cool the room, it just makes a lot of noise blowing air. I filled the ice chest for the first two weeks with ice consistently and then I just realized it was pointless. I puchased it to save money on a mobile air conditioner, but I have been unable to sleep without any cool air, so I had to go ahead and purchase a portable air conditioner."
5,how could i possibly try to rate this one ?,Rate is a wrong word when it comes to the best live rock album ever
5,The reason it's on 2 discs...,"The reason the material is on 2 discs is because hybrid SACDS hold more information (SACD material plus red book CD material) and thus cannot fit 80 minute of music on them. That is why this album is spread over 2 discs. It made more sense to split the album in half, just like the original LP, rather than put all but one song on the CD and then put the last song on the 2nd disc. The entire album would not have fit.The same thing happened with Elton John's Goodbye Yellow Bring Road SACD - while the redbook CD is on 1 disc, the SACD version wouldn't have fit.Don't think you're being ripped off. It's the price you pay for an audiophile listening experience."
3,Good,"Some of the recordings, I thought were long in length. I was expecting two disc instead of just one but, it a great CD"
3,Dated,"I'm not sorry I bought it, but this music is too dated for my ears. You might want 'Mountain Jam' but I would settle for the single disk version of this."
4,"Exellent - but ""The Fillmore Concerts"" 2 Disc is better","When originally released, this album was an absolute breakthrough, and there has been nothing quite like it since.I would nonetheless caution people about purchasing this release over the Two-disc ""The Fillmore Concerts"".The latter album contains tracks that are not availible on this version, including fantastic versions of ""Trouble No More"", ""Don't Keep Me Wonderin'"", ""Stormy Monday"" and ""Drunken Herted Boy"". While purists may scoff at the additional material and multiperformance splicing of ""The Fillmore Concerts"" (by the Allmans Engineer), my side by side comparisons have led me to determine that it is in fact, a better album than this one, and easily worth the additional $$$ despite the fact that there is some overlap with EAP.If you can't afford the two-disc, than by all means pick up this original classic. You may regret not forking out the extra cash however, as I have."
5,Hours of Jammin' Blues!!!,"This is a great investment! Duane starts out with a great slide guitar in ""Statesboro Blues"" You almost feel like you are at the concert. I also love the 20 minute ""You don't love me""....It just makes you want to get up and dance, especially during the guitar break.""Elizabeth Reed"" is a 10 minutes of jazz.... and what blues concert would be complete without T-Bone Walkers sexy ""Stormy Monday"" Gregg Allmans voice sounding smooth like melted butter."
2,Poor Surround Mix,"It was such a disappointment when I cued this disc. I looked forward to hearing a spacious recreation of the Fillmore and the ABB playing loud.The sound quality is great, but the mix is terrible. Duane is more behind you and there is no focused soundstage, more audio hocus-pocus than an audio document of one of the all time best live rock concerts.Do yourself a favor by choosing the SACD version of this disc. It is a different mix and it is very enjoyable. This statement is even more accurate if your system accommodates HDMI 1.3."
5,I'm in love with You Don't Love Me!,"I have been listening this song almost every day for quite a while this year and I just can't get tired of it. I think it's the strongest live jam I have ever heard. I love when talented musicians deconstruct old tunes and put them back together with their own interpretations. And the version of ""You Don't Love Me"" on this record is the greatest example of this I've come across. Joy to the world, the Allman Brothers play on!"
5,Wore out 2 copies in college and afterwards,"This is the only album (vinyl) that I ever bought (and wore out) 2 copies of. I bought THE FILLMORE CONCERTS 2CD set nearly four years ago. This was more than 15 years after I last played my vinyl copies. I could still recall the ""original"" well enough from the COUNTLESS times I played it to detect the differences, e.g., Hot 'Lanta. Maybe I will buy this one, too, so I can have both ""the old"" and ""the new."" Either way, the music is awesome and Elizabeth Reed still ""takes me away."" I saw the ABB in 1973 and 1974 (alas, post-Duane and post-Barry), and later saw Dicky Betts solo, too. I'm getting old, but this music/this set will never age!"
5,mind blowing,"this is the greatest rock album i have ever heard. period. this band was unreal. duane was the greatest guitar soloist ever, and behind his power was a band that played every note tight, clear, and with conviction. this band loved to play, and oh man, this album is magical."
5,A very live recording,"I think this is an album that represents a lot of an era that is very hard to come back again. Long solos, very well orchestrated, it's worth having this album and I recommed it to anyone with taste of rock/jazz, because in this early stages, the two types of music collided. The recording is somewhat clean (taking in count the available technology in the time) and in SACD, it sounds really live. My personal favorite is Whipping Post."
5,One Of The Allman Brothers Band's Best Albums,"AT FILLMORE EAST is one of the Allman Brothers Band's best albums ever. Although most of the songs are longer than five minutes, the band, especially vocalist Gregg Allman and guitarists Duane Allman and Dickey Betts, play with so much heart and soul that no motion is ever wasted. This album is one of the crucial live albums of the 70s, paving the way for fusion, progressive rock, and funk. Moreover, the surviving (past and present) members' advocacy of sanctions against countries that falsely convict foreign visitors for trumped-up crimes, as well as their support for efforts to free American journalists jailed in Iran and North Korea on false charges, and their endorsement of police use of deadly force to rescue two girls kidnapped in California in 2002, makes this album an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."
5,"The reviews shown above, are correct. This is the ONE !!","Buy the CD,find a quiet room,(no distractions), turn up the volume, (you'll know how loud),find a comfortable chair, maybe have a couple of cold ones on reserve, clear your mind, and look forward to listening to, without a doubt, the greatest live album ever. It never gets old !!"
3,Live Allman Brothers,"I bought this CD because it's the only one of their CD's that I know of that has ""Stormy Monday"" on it. Unfortunately, several of the other tracks sound to me like so much stoned out, mindless meandering on lead guitar; kind of boring and amateurish. ""Stormy Monday"" lives up to the Allman Brothers name, though."
3,If You Like Jams Then Pick This One Up,"No doubt about it. The Allman Brothers will live on as one of the Classic Jam Bands that ever recorded music. Duane Allman and Dickey Betts could solo like only a handful of others. Jamoe, Greg, Butch, and Berry are talents as well.This recording is loaded with Blues based jams delivered in a rock n roll setting. Where the tunes are pretty cool, after a while the length of the songs can grate on many listeners nerves. This collection would be more appropriate in video as one can see and feel the experience of an Allman Brothers Concert. Die hard fans should grab this collection right away but those who like a little more polish and focus with song length not exceding ten minutes can pass this one by."
5,Oh Lord it feels like I'm dying,"Allman Brothers at their peak, and by Allman Brothers I mean the original six cats that brought us this great music..Duane Allman was finger tapping while van halen was in diapers.. This whole cd is amazing from beginning to end..Duane pushing the whole band, them pushing back..showing their greatness track after track..Oh my I can't stress how important this is to have in your collection, not just for ABB fans but for anyone who is a fan of guitar, jazz, blues, rock, fusion and all inbetween. I will keep this short as others have already pretty much explained it, but to all.. REMEMBER DUANE ALLMAN"
5,We are not worthy !,"Words fail me,. . . almost. This is one of the ballsiest, bluseiest, rockingest albums ever. Duane Allman was a guitar GOD. At this point in his life Gregg Allman was the grittiest white blues singer I had ever heard. These tracks are pure gold and this maybe the BEST live album ever!Every cut is good but Stateboro Blues still blows me away and I had never heard anything like Whipping Post before or still to this day. This was the band at it's best and sadly it never came close again."
5,WOW! This CD sounds fantastic in DTS,This is one of the better DTS recordings out there. Not to mention a classic recording on its own. The sound is perfectly mixed and truly brings out the beauty of this recording. If you have a DTS decoder PICK THIS UP!
3,Not a great DTS recording,Don't get me wrong the band sounds great but the recording in DTS is kind of messed up. Too much sound coming from rear speakers makes it sound like the band is behind you.
1,Unoriginal southern rock.. stick with Kings of Leon,"I was at a bar wearing my Kings Of Leon t-shirt and a bunch of drunken buffoons in theirs 50s with heavy hick accents said that the Kings Of Leon sucked. Then I said, ""No way! They're getting a lot of airplay on the radio and even Miley Cyrus likes them... they're real southern rock!"" and they all started guffawing and ROFL'ing at me. This old hippie with a long white beard and ponytail told the bartender to play some Allman Brothers to show ""this kid what real southern rock is"". Needless to say I hated it! The guitar playing is boring, the songs are WAY too long and the singer sounds like a redneck.. for real southern rock check out Kings Of Leon, Kid Rock, Carrie Underwood, Garth Brooks and Taylor Swift!"
5,The One That Brought Success,"With two previous studio releases that failed to move on the charts, this is the record that put the Allman Brothers Band on the map. Gregg Allman said they went from living on $3 a day (before) to getting five digit weekly checks in the mail after ""At Filmore East"" was released. Part of the success is due to the death of Duane Allman. Why do artist get the recognition they deserve after they die. This is the first Allman Brothers record to display their creative improvisation skills with the long Whippin' Post cut at over 23 minutes. This album is a must have for every Rock, Blues, and Southern Rock fan."
5,PLAY ALL NIGHT!!!,"The Allman's performance at the peak of their greatness....I won't waste anyone's time trying to describe what an incredible band they were during the Duane Allman/Berry Oakley era. This remastered DTS recording....Listen for yourself. This has to be the definitive version of this five star classic live album. I've owned the Mobile Fidelity Orginial Master Recordings on both vinyl and the 14Ct Gold CD, (the vinyl still kicks). The Deluxe Edition (includes the bonus tracks ""Mountain Jam"" and ""Drunkin' Hearted Boy"") is very good. But the sound is no match for this DTS version. It simply doesn't get better than this.Take it from one who was at The Fillmore East on March 13, 1971. This is the Mother-Loade, The Grand Wazoo, The Holy Grail and more. Trust me...Toss this baby into your DVD player, get comfortable and turn down the lights. You'll soon be screemin' ""PLAY ALL NIGHT""!!! I know I did."
5,Lives up to its reputation,"Believe all the praise you've heard about this live set, because it's truly one of the best live albums ever. The Allman Brothers jam to perfection on blistering numbers that rival and surpass their studio counterparts. The highlights are Statesboro Blues, Hot'Lanta, and of course, the 20 minute plus rendition of Whipping Post. Blues rock has never sounded better live. Afficianados of live albums should find this gem worth every penny."
3,Nice but I prefer...,This product is nice enough but I much prefer the Solitudes recordings produced by Dan Gibson. The different tracks on this CD sound very similar to one another and don't do an adequate job of blending the true sounds of nature. Beautiful symphonic music however. I give it 3 stars out of 5. (there's better music out there)
1,offensive,"I understand that bluegrass is a beautiful form of music, but whoever covered ""Michael"" changed the object of Michael's affection from ""I"" to ""she."""
4,great reference,I got this book for free but it turned out that it had a few things in there that I never knew. Being an IT pro this book was a good refresher!
2,Symantec Promotional Book Home Internet Security,"I thought that it was a software, but was surprised to get a book. Who really has a time to go through the book."
3,Tarkington's First Work,"A prolix novel about a small town in Indiana called Plattsville. A stranger from out of town arrives and buys the failing (and laughable ) newspaper and turns it into something worth reading. In the process, the strange, Harkless, expels political scoundrels and angers the ""white-caps"" (ala, KKK ) in the suburb outside of town.This is also a characteristic and somewhat predictable love story that Tarkington delivers so easily, with a bit of a surprise ending for the reader. The book is wordy and contains mellifluous descriptions that drone on. However, despite it being slow, it picks up about 50% of the way through and delivers a solid story."
3,Not really that unforgettable (3.5),"Okay, I'll admit one thing: This album has some really great tracks. ""Pride"" in particular is totally classic, one of their greatest even now. Its arena rock stab works well with a really big sound and good message. Other highlights are in ""Wire"" and ""Indian Summer Sky."" The title track is actually kind of memorable and is well made musically. It is not really their most well-aged either. I prefer ""War"" and ""Actung Baby"" by miles, even the debut ""Boy"" to this. The songs aren't that bad but they just aren't that interesting. In spite having one of the greatest U2 songs ever, this is just an album to me, nothing more & nothing less."
5,The Unforgettable Album,"I certainly feel that this is one of the greatest albums recorded of all time. ""Unforgettable's"" breakthough and unique sound has made it a timeless masterpiece. Bono's vocals are by far his most passionate and powerful. Edge's guitar is nothing short of brilliant. Even after 15 years of listing to this record, I still get chills."
4,Very good and unforgettable songs,"""A sort of homecoming"", ""Pride"", the beautiful """"The unforgettable fire"", ""Bad"" and ""MLK"" are the highlight of the album.I like this cd very much, greatly done U2 !"
3,One of U2's finest albums,"With 'The Unforgettable Fire', here we witness a band in transition from it's indie roots on the verge of iconic status. Once again, central to any U2 album is the marriage of The Edge's colourful guitar-chimes, Bono's emotional cries, and profound lyrics/themes. Stand-out tracks include 'Pride (In The Name Of Love)' an inspiring yet haunting homage to Martin Luther King, the heart-warming string-ladened 'The Unforgettable Fire', the vitriolic power of 'Wire', and the epic ballad 'Bad'. The band continues to evolve, gradually straying away from it's raw-alternative sound and political credos, to a more polished and cleaner recording, much of the credit attributed to producer Daniel Lanois. This CD demonstrates a band finding it's identity, shaking the cult/underground status without losing it's musical edge and sharpness. On the cusp of global and mainstream success, 'The Unforgettable Fire' is a calling-card of the greatness that lies ahead."
4,Mostly excellent,"A quality record by virtue of a scattering of classic tracks that highlight U2's unique ability to blend the atmospherics of their War-style art rock with irrestible pop catchiness. The result is at least five superb songs mixed with a collection of ludicrous filler material, including the ""strange sounds"" of 4th of July and the bizarre Elvis Presley...(Maybe I just don't get it...) Excellent, even though you might have to habitually skip a few numbers."
5,The album that introduced me to U2.,"I gave The Unforgettable Fire five stars for more sentimental reasons than anything else. Sure, this is an excellent cd by an excellent group, but it was seeing the tour that promoted this album that instantly made me convert into U2ism. It was February 25, 1985 @ Reunion Arena, Dallas, a night I'll never forget, when I first saw four T-shirt-and-jeans clad boys from Dublin walk on stage who not only looked like me, but manged to be superstars while looking like me. At the time, I was intimidated by all the babes going for guys looking like Duran Duran. So I tried looking like a member from Duran Duran just to get girls, only to end up looking like a fool. the members of U2 and thier music taught me that by being ""cool"" means you're only comforming to a fashion club that may not accept you, and that your not being true to yourself in the process."
3,It has it moments,"But I can only name 5 classics on this album, A Sort of homecoming, Pride, Wire, Unforgettable Fire, and Bad.Though the rest is ok, it is hardly anything special. Still I think it's worth buying for those tracks alone because they are that good and you certainly don't feel cheated!!!P.S3 stars means good!!!5- Classic 4- Excellent 3- Good 2- Average 1- Poor"
3,Among my least favorite U2 CD's,"I'm primarily a rock guy, and don't care so much for U2's softer-sounding CD's. I'm speaking of this one and their latest, _All that you Can't Leave Behind_."
5,What happened to U2?,"This album was a work of art - no question. If only U2 could produce something that even closely resembles it today - instead of the absolute trash that followed with the release of Zooropa. This music invokes imagery like no other - except maybe for the Joshua Tree. ""Bad"" is one of the greatest songs of all time!"
5,Burning Black Flesh?,"For those saying thats the first line of ""Elives Presley and America""...Nonono! Bono's singing Black Flash. Don't listen to those giving a bad review of this...it's really a wonderful CD. Personally, I like it better then the Joshua Tree. It has one of my Top Five favorite U2 songs on it, ""Bad."" There isn't a single song on this disc that you have to skip. This CD is one of the rare ones, where every song is good, even if you listen to it all the time."
4,Lull before the storm,"This album was a departure from the first three and was a forebear of the U2 ""sound"" which has been their trademark ever since. It lacks the drive and energy of the first 3 albums, instead Eno and Lanois bring a different palette of sounds to U2. It isn't ""The Joshua Tree"" but it certainly shows how they got there. ""Bad"" is the highlight - used to wonderful effect at LiveAid. ""Pride"" and ""Wire"" have a fuller sound but reminiscent of their earlier works. Unfortunately the pace is let drop a couple of times giving an incomplete feel to the album. It isn't one of their classic albums but it is definitely worth checking out and should find its way in to any complete U2 collection."
5,"one word, Pride","this album kicks!the song Pride is my all time favorite song. Lyrically honoring, musically more than satisfying, I can't say enough.Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois have added a touch to this record that cannot be matched. the songs on it are terrific, and it is a must have for any u2 fan."
4,Muchs as I Love Lanois' Production....,"...It just doesn't ""pop""(pardon the pun)As brilliant as ""Achtung Baby"" is, (And LORD, is it a masterpiece...)UF is a nice, mellow, ""Get to know me"", album.And that's not a bad thing, it's just that Bono's voice starts to sound like a jackhammer during a hungover morning.Don't get me wrong, UF/AB/ and JT are the three best cd's that U2 will ever record, it's just important to pick your poison.All 3 are indispensable recordings, it's just that UF could use a little more work."
4,**my first review**,"I never did like JayZ; I am not too big a fan of rap (with a few exceptions). Linkin Park however, has been my #1 favorite band for a few years now. I await every album with extreme anticipation, and am NEVER let down by the delivery. Collision Course is an excelent blending of great sounds. I still don't like JayZ, but his sound works so well with LP in this Mash Up.. it's just incredible. While it definately is not one of LPs best at all, the fresh beats and JayZ lyrics offer a great new take on some of LPs best.Collision Course is a must-have for LP fans, as well as JayZ fans. Pay no attention to LP ""fans"" stating that LP and JayZ don't mix well because rock and rap don't mix well. A true Linkin Park fan would know and appreciate that all genres are worth a listen. It's all art, and that's what Linkin Park stands for.To all true openminded music lovers (not self-righteous genre biased losers): Pick up a copy of Collision Course. It's a excellent listen."
4,Depending on Your Taste of Music........,"This is a good album. When I first bought this album I was not really a Jay-Z fan and was a former Linkin Park fan. This is a great combination of both artist greatest hits. The mixing was done very well. I became more of a Jay-Z fan after listening to this album. I remembered exactly why I used to like LP (This album made me listen to Hybrid Theory after a good year and a half). I recommend this album to anyone who likes Hybrid Theory and likes Jay-Z's older hits (not from the Black Album). If you hate both of the artist's you will probably hate this album. But, if you like either of these artist's you will probably find yourself singing along to atleast one of the songs. I think you should buy this album or at the very least check it out from your library."
3,ALTHOUGH I HATE JAYZ I LOVED THIS CD,"ALL THE SONGS ARE OK I JUST THOUGHT THEY COULD MAKE A LITTLE MORE. EVEN W/ TH DCD I STILL THINK ITS A RIP OFF, DVD'S AREN'T THAT EXPENSIVE TO MAKE PLUS HAS LACK OF GOOD SPECIAL FETURES"
4,Great Mix,This album is a great mix for Jay-Z and LP. The blend of songs and lyrics make this album hit on both the rock and rap charts
3,"Not a huge fan of these artists, but good music",i enjoy the blending on this album. It sounds good and older rap and rock groups should collab like this more often
4,Stood the Test Of Time,"Yes,I know no one uses physical media anymore. Now is the time of streaming, or torrents or downloads of specific songs from one's local purveyor. The reason for this is simple. There just isn't enough content to justify buy the entirety of media. Why buy a cd, if there are only a few good songs? This is in my opinion one of the few cd's out there just justify the purchase. even if it is just to enjoy the fusion of teo unlike, but highly complementary artists from the last decade.The dvd is a great bonus that shows the studio process that brings these artists together and honestly, there is not one single weak track throughout."
1,More Crap,i didn't think i would ever see this day. two artist(at least that's what they think they are). get into the studio and take their best songs and make it one song. this i call crap. instead of buying the album just write a check or send a money order to the jay-z/ LP Beach House Fund. hahaha.
2,No. Terrible CD.,"Probably the worst thing from Linkin Park since Meteora. If you want a real Linkin Park album, go out and get Hybrid Theory or Reanimation. Those were their best albums. Anyway, I guess i'll individually rate each song. I didn't get the DVD with mine, which is very odd.1. Dirt Off Your Shoulder/Lying from You - (6 of 10)This one is okay. TI has Jay - Z's Dirt Off Your Shoulder as the background song, and Linkin Park sings 'Lying from You.' Dirt Off Your Shoulder makes a good background song. Jay - Z isn't cussing like a sailor on this one! I don't think he even sings on this one, he might add a few lyrics. I didn't really like this song though.2. Big Pimpin'/Papercut (8 out of 10)I remember back when I was like, eight-years-old dancing to this song. I thought I was a pimp. ;PThe background music is"
1,what is worst rap or mix both of this artists?,"The worst thing its to mix both of this artists ! Jay z suck ass and linkin park the most overrated band on the world, this cd its a perfect crap mixing songs so awful along with the sound they both produce. Do not waste your money on this crap."
5,great album,I dont know why all u mother f*ckers say dis was a bad album. dis was one of the greatest albums. i listen to dis all da time.
1,What is the point?!,"First we had reanimation fair enough that was average but now this!!!I'm all for merging genres of different music but this is Linkin Park. They have rehashed their old stuff way too many times for me to actually sit up and take notice. They have now become too mainstream and concerned about money and this has ultimately cost most of the public's respect both on this side and across the Atlantic.Songs like ""99 Problems/Points of Authority/One Step Closer"" are worth a listen but pretty soon you'll be craving for more of what they have become successful for. Does the likes of ""Hybrid Theory"" ring any bells to you?I was a fan of Linkin Park, now I'm yearning for the old days where they weren't so mainstream. I won't be holding my breath for their next offering it'll probably be just another album full of recycled old stuff from the good old days."
1,what?!?!?,"Let's get one thing out of the way...Linkin Park is the best rock band in existence and Jay-Z is some loser rapper who is just trying to steal someone else's talent to make more $$mula$$. These songs are HORRIBLE. I'd rather listen to elevator music or the crap they play when they put you on hold. i don't actually OWN the CD, but i heard some of it from my friend who likes rap. RAP IS CRAP...Jay-Z steals every song with little to no singing of Chester and Mike. The classic Linkin Park stuff is ruined by Jay-Z's annoying voice and low-talent lyrics. I just hope LP doesn't do something stupid like this again and that their next CD blows everything else away. Linkin Park...ROCK ON. Jay-Z...get a life."
2,It's ok,Look just buy Meteora and Hybrid Theory from Linkin Park. Now if you only listen to rap then you'll probably just buy to this album. The point is that this is pretty much the same thing as the normal songs except in the middle they'll cut and put in part of a Jay Z song or vice versa. It's better if just listen to Linkin Park album cuz it sounds better without Jay Z.Best: Numb/EncoreWorst: Big Pimpin'/Papercut - LP's best song totally ruined.
2,JUST STOP ALREADY!!!!,"Listen....I thought ""Jigga Man"" was retired. I hate when these so called ""RAPPERS"" retire then do like 10 more albums. Jay Z said that after THE BLACK ALBUM, which was ok, that he was done. But of course he had to do an album with R. Kelly and now sum crap with Linkin Park. Please if you do RETIRE STAY RETIRED it is soooo dumb, the only reason that he continues to do this crap is because he can't let the SPOTLIGHT go, not to mention the cash flow being cut off. The main excuse that these ""RAPPERS"" use is that ""I MEANT THAT THE BLACK ALBUM WAS GONNA BE MY LAST SOLO ALBUM"",The key word being SOLO so they go and do more crap with different people that way it is not a SOLO project! Whatever man. JUST QUIT!!!REASONABLE DOUBT 4 EVER!!!!"
1,Feed them garbage and let them feast,"Without a doubt many may think this travesty to be akin to the ""genius"" of the Public Enemy/Anthrax abortion that spawned the excrement that was to become so-called ""nu-metal,rap metal,metal core, whatever, etc. I for one am not among them. If I could rank this drivel with a negative number I would, but I gave it a 1 star review simply for the 'marketeers', PR people, managers, and especially the vanity of the playas themselves who have the b*lls and the audacity to once again pander to the lowest common denominator of music fan and think that they'd suck-cede. When such obvious and cynically marketed product such as this sells even a single CD it just proves again that if you feed them only garbage the masses will gladly eat! Now choke on it gangstas..."
2,"Regretful, I am.","I dont know what drives me in the first place to get this album, but I regret having it.I try to like it, but I can't. Linkin Park is -talentless- to say the least. After so many years, and no NEW tracks? They need to start working instead of depending on their meager past hits to stay alive and rich.All I can say is - This album is the biggest regret in the music industry. Agree, or disagree, I don't care. They just are. Add in Jay Z who majorly sucks.That's it. Take its review for what's its worth - some bucks you can use to buy other worthy albums."
2,Only Rock Please,I haven't even bought the C.D. and I think it's terrible! I mean most of it's rap which I hate! There's barely any rock in the whole C.D. I give it two stars.
1,Jay-Z worse than disco,"Unbelievable. I love Linkin Park and then they produce this trash. Jay-Z...who buys this stuff. I actually tried listening to his stuff, Can you say monotonous and boring. I cannot suggest purchasing this CD."
1,"Why God, Why???","Why did Linkin Park ruin perfect songs with a lot of of hard rock and put some crap into them with some [...] rapper's songs and people will love it because it's [...]. This jay-z guy gets woman just because he can rap! hey i can rap anyone can it is a talentless thing that anyone can do and why dont we all just rap because anyone can do it! But Linkin Parks rapper has a cool style of rapping and i like the way he raps, he's like the only rapper i dont dislike. This sucks!!! Linkin Park please stop being lazy and get another cd out soon, dont try to be greedy by getting more and more cds out!"
2,More Rap then rock,"This album is good for the casual music fan who listens to everything. But if your into Linkin Park and and other metal bands you probley won't like this one. I gave it 2 stars cause ""Numb/encore"" and ""points of authority/99problems/one step closer"" have there moments , but still not near LP's usuall stuff."
2,Not worth your money,I was really looking forward to listening to a great CD. Instead I was extremely disapointed. There are probably only 2 good songs on the CD. Not worth your money.
1,Total Garbage...,"In all my years of listening to music I have never heard such an abomination like Jay-Z and Linkin Park's ""Collision Course."" When did these 2 artists think ""hey, let's take all of our old s***, mix it together and make some new s***!?"" Seriously. Some of Linkin Park's most noteworthy songs are totally trashed on this album (forget Meteora, that album just sucked!). Hybrid Theory is rubbed in the dirt thanks to this album!Perhaps we should've seen this coming from ""Meteora."" Linkin Park would've been an amazing Nu-Metal band has they just grown a little, but all they've done is stagnated and frankly regressed as a group. I'm not even going to go on to Jay-Z because, well, I hate his stuff and rap in general.Let's pray that the gods of metal will cast a bolt of divining lightning down on Linkin Park and knock this stupid crap stuck inside of them, and maybe one day we'll see a return to form by a band that should've changed everything..."
1,WHAT WERE YOU THINKING???????????????????,"Well friends, my saying is ""long live rock n' roll"", but it seems our ""friends"" of linkin park have betrayed us. Why though? Even for semi-sellouts those guys used to be really cool. What went wrong? Were they not makeing enough money without that moron singing for them? Pardon my English but OPEN YOUR EYES DAMNIT!!!! Lets just hope Linkin Park can get their heads outta their hind ends in the future. All fans of TRUE rock/metal will be EXTREMELY disapointed."
1,horrible...if had three thumbs i'd put them all down,"i saw the stupid dvd to this at a friends house and i woundered whatwas going through their minds when they made this junk it's a wasteof money don't buy it, rap and rock don't belong and linkin park isjust horrible in it's own right"
1,Wow. Where should I begin?,"I borrowed this CD from a friend and can now safely say that if there was only one generation of teenagers who could truly be described as ""tasteless"" AND pathetic, it is the current one. My generation, im ashamed to say. Listen, i know this is what is popular right now, but that dosent make up for the fact that this stuff is absolute crap. STOP LETTING MTV THINK FOR YOU AND ACTUALLY THINK FOR YOURSELVES FOR ONCE!!!You know, There was once a time when I actually listened to Linkin Park (Jay-Z, on the other hand, has always been on my crap list), back when i was 14 and had a bad case of ADD and mtvitis (the gradual de-generation of the brain caused by MTV's brainwashing). Now days, i'm willing to hunt this band down to get my $40 back from Hybrid Theory and Meteora(I'll save my opinion on CD prices for another day)."
4,Excellent mesh,"First and foremost -- If you don't appreciate Jay-Z or rap in general, do not buy this album. If you're already a Linkin Park fan, you most likely have a slight acceptance of 'rap' music, since its naive to think that LP isn't heavily influenced by the genre. As someone who is a fan of both Rap & Rock music, this is an absolutely fantastic mesh of the respective artists top songs (well, 6 of them at least). This album is worth a try, I was lucky enough to hear one of the tracks on the radio and I was hooked."
5,Excellent,"While I am a hard-core Linkin Park fan, my exposure to hip/hop/rap was strictly from listening to my teenage son's CDs from another room or in the car.I must say I am VERY VERY impressed! Unique sound and concept. My only criticism is that the CD is too short...but on the other hand, listening to the songs over and over makes it easier to learn the Jay-Z lyrics.DVD was both interesting and fun. Highly, Highly recommended."
2,Bad.,"I Ordered A 2-Disc Set and it said ""like new"" when there was only one disc, and the case was extremely worn. I would not buy more from this seller."
5,This was great,I never heard Jay-Z before buying this CD. I only heard their song Numb/Encore. That was the main reason for buying this CD. But it was such an enjoyable experience as well as the DVD that came along with it. I enjoy how they meshed both Linkin Park and Jay-Z songs together. I don't what any of his songs were like before this but they sound really awesome combined with Linkin Parks songs.I really liked that it was more than just 1 song. Really worth the price.
4,No Idea Why,"You either like this album, or hate it. I do not like Linkin Park, nor Jay Z, but I love this album...I have no idea why. It's a bit short, but such a fun listen it's worth a buy."
1,stupid,"I think collaborations like this are stupid and pointless. It's just not right for a no talent rapper to be rapping with a very talented rock band. They just don't go together. I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone. This album is not worth buying, it definately doesn't live up to the hype."
1,has anyone mentioned that linkin park... sucks?,"Though a fan, I'm quite critical of Jay-Z. He has some tight songs, for sure... but Linkin Park is music for idiots. Why take a pretty good track like ""Big Pimpin"" and ruin it with LP? What do you expect when you take a song thats already half-crappy like ""Izzo"" and put the worst representation of modern rock behind it? Sure, an improvement for Linkin Park, but does Jay-Z really want his name attached to this piece of dung? Too late for second guesses, I suppose."
1,*barfs*,"Utterly HORRIBLE. This album sickens me. Jay-Z is among the worst rappers ever. Linkin Park is awesome, but that horrible rapper kills the CD. RAP SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Even worse is that on the radio, they play these tracks far more than the good, normal LP ones. >p"
1,this album is nothing special..,"I have three linkin park albums: hybrid theory, meteora, and reanimation.. I HAD this one. I gave it to my friend after I listened to it.I just don't understand why lp had to join with jay-z! my mom liked linkin park, because they could be cool and not curse. this album has nothing but 'nigger this, nigger that'.. I just don't understand any of this. why did they have to change? bring the old lp back!"
1,N-Sync Is better than this,"I agree with a lot of people on this: (...)! Glad I got that out. No I'll get this out a little more calmly. What the hell happened to Linkin Park? I mean, I know they were always mainstream, but none of their previous albums had any traces of what i like to call ""selloutism"". But this untalented work of earsplitting noise is saturated with ""selloutism"". Again, Linkin Park's previous albums (with the exception of Reanimation and Live in Texas) were actually worth listening to. Jay-Z was always crap so we can skip that. All in all, you'd be better off buying N-Sync or Hilary Duff or any other pop mainstream work of crap that only teenyboppers actually like."
5,Great stuff!!!,"I really enjoyed this album. Taking two diverse musical views and mashing them up seems like trouble. However, with this venture, both Jay Z and Linkin Park come out looking even better to me. I'm not a music critic, but I know what I like. I love the energy of this production. I liked both JayZ and Linkin Park before I heard this, but as I listen to the album again and again, I gain new respect for each of them."
3,good but just dont cut it,This cd is cool but its just is not LP. for one thing JAY Z raps to much wheres LP? the cd is to short if it were not for the dvd this would be the worst LP cd ever. BUT the dvd is not great if you have the clean verson the dvd is crap they cut more words than the cd does. ALL TOGETHER IT IS GOOD BUT NOT GREAT LACKS LP 2 STARS DVD MAKES 3 YES THATS HOW BAD THE DVD IS
2,Jay-Z just doesn't fit !,"When I first heard about this CD, I was really excited ( condisering that im a hege LP fan) but this CD was just a huge dissapointment.First of all, (I can't stress this enough)Jay-Z doesn't fit! Second the songs are so different from the other songs they sang without Jay-Z (even though they are just remixes) that it doesn't even seem like LP wrote them. Most of these song are basically remixes with Jay-Z singing most of the lyrics. If you are a LP fan then don't get this CD, it will change your mind anout LP , in a bad way, just wait for their next CD (hopefully without anyone else)."
2,Why Jay-Z? WHY?!?!?!,"Out of ANY band in the world, dumb MTV had to choose Jay-Z! ANY band would have been better! It would even be better if LP teamed up with AC/DC. (That wouldn't be bad actually) JZ is always singing he is a pimp... NO HE ISNT! He is loser rapper who THINKS all the ladies love him. Also, when they mashed up the songs, the songs lost all meening. These are some lyrics for One Step Closer and 99 problemsEverything you say to me, 99 problems and a bitch aint one.Do you understand those words? I don't... Unfortunitly, I own the CD, but do yourself a favor and don't buy it. (unless you like JZ, then you'll like it alot)"
4,I want more!!!!,"This is a good, if short album which leaves us wanting more. I don't know if that was there intention but after listening to this, it sounds like a sample for a complete album they could make which I will surely buy."
5,gotta love LP,"this cd is so awesome. i watched the show when it was on mtv! i was surprised to see these two matched together and thought it wouldn't work, but it does. i love LP and Jay-Z rocks!! this is my favorite cd, as for right now. the DVD is so great! it has a version of the show, interviews, and the mtv version of the show. if you care about cussing, this is not the cd for you, even if you love linkin park! there is no way you could appreciate this cd if you got the edited version. edited versions should be outlawed anyways, but thats a different story. if you love linkin park, or are part of the LP underground this is a must have cd."
5,This disc is hot!,"WOW! LP and Jigga really hit the jackpot on this disc. Being a huge linkin park fan got me to grab it, but Jay Z is the real star on this..his lyrics are crazy on Jigga What/Faint, he's so fast and you really get into it. Great disc for jammin in the car sittin in traffic on the 101! The DVD is phenomenal too, gettin a chance to see Shinoda, Hahn, and Shawn Carter kick it is a once and a lifetime experience. Pick it up!"
3,Die-Hards Only,"Essentially, Collision Course is just an album of remixes cleverly paraphrased as Mash-Ups. While the tracks in Reanimation more than justify the album title; the impression you get from listening to CC seems to suggest that the intended impact has missed its target by a huge margin. Although the studio mastery is excellent as usual, the songs fail to lift themselves from mediocrity despite being the collaborative result of two of the music industry's biggest names. Those who expect expletive-free music should well take note that this album marks a departure from Linkin Park's signature pissed-yet-polite delivery.At its best CC is a fun album, but nothing, except the addictive Numb/Encore, really warrants repeated listening after the novelty wears off."
3,[...],"[...] This album is all about mates having fun,numb and encore flow seemlessly into and out-of one and other, papercut and big pimping are solid enough along with the quality 99 problems mix. as i say its mates having fun, but maybe theres not enough music on the disc to warrente paying full normal price for it but then the dvd balances it out to an honest cd and not one to simply cash in.solid and class mixes thoughout maybe not enough tunes on it but the 2nd disc makes up for the price"
3,Superb remix CD,"Let's face it, reanimation kinda sucked, but this is off the freeken chains! It would be nice if it had atleast 10 and not 6 tracks.Seeing that Bone Thug's CD had 8 tracks [techinally 7 not including the instumental] but this is still good CD by LP and Jay-Z."
4,Better than expected,"Personally I'm not a fan of rap perfromers such as Jay-Z, still like LP's style. But mixed with LP's beats and lyrics this is worth listening. Some parts of this release are spectacular and both performers complement each other very nicely. However only there are only 6 tracks. Other parts with only rap-style beats and Jay-Z's voice alone don't sound so attractive.Overall: recommended if you either like LP or Jay-Z."
3,Never thought it was possible...,"I like Jay-Z. He is one of the most talented rappers in the world and trust me, if you listen to this album you will see why. He can adjust to the rock music and fast and slow beats.I dislike Linkin Park, but after hearing this album, they have grown on me. They do very well and can work around the rap beats with their own talents, the music. The music basically makes this album so musch better than the original songs.I also own Jay-Z the Black Album. I thought that it was good, but this album more or less wipes the floor with its sound and lyrical rythem.Overall, this album is a must for any Jay-Z or Linkin Park fans.PS: The DVD that comes with this is very entertaining and shows behind the scenes footage. This is worth the album price alone..."
3,it was pretty good,i have to say it wasn't the best album i've ever heard. i liked a few of the tracks and it's not a bad cd to rock out to when i'm driving. other than that though i probably won't be able to listen to this cd too many times and since i'm not a huge fan of rap anyway i didn't really like how some of the songs were mixed. creatively done great collaboration and i'm sure they worked hard at it but on a personal level it won't be one of my favorites
4,Collision Course by Jay Z/Linkin Park,"I picked up this album the day it came out, dropped it in my CD player in my car, and haven't taken it out since. Some people have seen this album as nothing more than a ""cash-grab"" by the corporate suits at MTV. But it's so much more than that. The tracks are all well mixed and produced. The only issue that I have with this album is that while this is a ""new album"" it would've added more if each had used an original score in the tracks rather than cutting and pasting from their own albums. Though it's still a great addition to anyone's collection."
4,Interesting concept - amazing execution,"Let me say this first, I am in no way a rap fan. I shudder when I hear Eminem or Tupac on radio....awful. Now Jay-Z I have really never heard of before this mash-up. I am definitely a Linkin' Park fan, and I had trepidations upon purchasing this DVD/CD in a digipack. But I was very surprised and pleasantly so, the combining of LP's rock with Jay-Z's rap is almost without hitches.The DVD is the winner of this item. It has the behind the scenes, the 6 song concert LIVE, as well as the MTV Mash-up. The two artists blended in well with each other and the two styles of music mixed well together and contributed to synthesis that will be remembered for a long time to come.I hope to see LP and Jay-Z join forces again real soon."
3,Mediocre,"This is a decent mash up, but moreso, it's the record companies seeing something amazing done online and trying to capitalize on it.DJ DangerMouse's Grey Album struck huge on the net. Mixing The Beatles White Album with Jay-Z's Black Album, which became The Grey Album. If you liked this, you'll be blown away by the Grey Album. You can still find it on the net if you look hard enough. And best of all, it's free. I'd recommend googling it and giving it a listen.Also, if you want a funny not-so-serious attempt at mash ups, google Jay-Zeezer. Jay-Z's Black Album mixed with Weezers Blue album. It gives for some amusing songs. Although the bonus track 99 Luft Problems is actually really neat, and sounds awesome. 99 problems mixed with 99 red balloons. Fun stuff."
1,How sad this Album is,This album is the worst Linkin Park Album ever. The sad attempt for Jay-z to try and mix his rap with Linkin Parks rock.Only Linkin Park should try rap-rock by theirselves not with a rapper who can't even sing. I gave this CD a star if Linkin Park did not do this album i would not give it any.
2,Linkin Park and Jay-Z don't mix.,"Linkin Park is one of my all-time favorite bands. To be honest, I only got this CD because it had the words ""Linkin Park"" on it. I put the CD in my player, and I was not impressed. Jay-Z ruined the whole thing with his horrible rapping. There were only six songs, and now this CD is left unlistened to inside my CD case. I do not reccomend this to LP fans. Instead, get Hybrid Theory or Meteora"
2,should not have been done,"I have sat and listened to this all the way through now at least 10 times as I drove from Sacramento, California to Vancouver, Washington. So I would say that I have given it a fair listen. What is the most interesting is the contrast in talent between Linkin Park and Jay-z. It wouldn't be anywhere near as noticeable if they weren't paired together like this. Every time Jay-z jumps in it's as if the music just trips over itself and dies. Linkin park is very good. It's strong, well written, emotional, rock n' roll with other genres thrown in here and there with little rap and a little electronica. But when it switches to just rap it's as if all the life was sucked out of the song. I do not understand why Jay-z is as popular as he is. He's just not very good. I will be returning this. Hopefully Linkin Park will be releasing a new cd soon."
1,People Call This Music?,"First time I heard this group, I checked the calendar to see whether the date was the 1st of April. People can actually stand this band. What affends me the most is this band is considered metal! Its a insult to bands like Iron Maiden, Megadeth, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin."
1,The Ghetto took over one of the best bands!,"Shame on Linkin Park for allowing this garbage sound!Have you no respect for yourselves?It is a no-no buy. Even better, it is available on E-Donkey. For full upload!Trash should not be rewarded!"
1,A Disappointment,"I loved Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory, Reanimation, and Meteora was okay. I was very excited to buy this CD; once I listened to it I was extremely disappointed. The songs have been shredded and turned into who can be the biggest pimp. I was saddened at the use of foul language; one of the reasons I kept buying Linkin Park CDs was that they expressed thimselves without explicit lyrics. Meteora was not one of my favorite CDs- I think I liked 3 songs on there. I ended up selling the LP/JayZ cd on here for cheap. I do not recommend spending your hard-earned money on such a pitiful CD."
1,Back To The Basics,"This album i think was just a ploy for Linkin Park to make some money. Personally i think this album is horrible because it went away from all of their style. I first herad the sone numb/encore on the radio and when i heard it i was astonished that linkin park would do something that horrible. they completely lowered their music to something horrible. I once respected the band because they were a rap-metal band, only they had more music then rap. I'm not a huge favorite of rap and any one who isn't a huge favorite of rap won't like this album."
1,NOT LP,"this CD is a dissapointment, its nothing like Linkin Park, its just a bunch of noise, now i am a rap fan, and same with my freinds, and when i bought the album i listened to it then the next day gave it to my freind, thats how GAY it is, oh and he hates it to, it just sucks, now if you want a REALLY awsome CD buy Reanimation, now that is Awsome, DONT BUY THIS CD"
4,An ironic experience,"What a game...great graphics, heart-pounding gameplay, excellent weapons, engrossing plot. It's really great! However, it has some problems. First of all, the other players are so stupid that I really need to be the only one DOING anything. I put all teams on hold and don't let them move unless I'm controlling them. I wish there were better team controls--it's unfortunate that you can only control the team leaders. In addition, this game crashes my computer SO MUCH. If they had tested the stinking PC port for about 10 hours they would have found some serious programming errors. What ever happened to SOLID programming! But I want to end this on a positive note, because I am addicted to it!"
5,apple cory,It works as stated it peels and slices and removes core all at one timeits easy to clean and i glad i got it
1,Piece of junk!,"This ""thing"" fell apart the first time I tried to use it. I followed the instructions to the letter, but the slicing blade fell off with the first apple! Save your money."
4,Apple Master Rocks!,"This handy little device will save you hours of work if you like to make apple pies! It is very easy to work, easy to clean, and you can get 10-12 apples peeled, cored, and sliced in less than five minutes. You can also use it to peel potatoes, although I use mine just for apples. Trust me, it is awesome. The only bummer is that big genetically modified apples do not work, so get the bagged little ones. It is also a learning curve as to how to position the apples. But if you love to make apple pies, you will LOVE this!"
3,Sliced too thin,"For my purposes, it would rate zero stars, but in fairness I gave it three. The trouble is: I am not interested in making apple sauce; I just want to eat a peeled and sliced apple. If the lead screw on the slicer creates a thick enough spiral, an apple-shaped spiral can be slid off the core, and one knife slice provides a neatly sliced apple. My two previous peelers did this. But this machine slices so thin that the spiral starts to turn inside out like a misbehaving coiled phone cord and then falls apart. So, I was forced to return the machine for a refund."
4,Not perfect but better then hand peeling,This peeler-- after fiddling with blade angle-- and making sure apple core is-- aligned level-- usually peels fairly well. It is not as good operating on mishaped apples or large sizes ones. Suction cup worked well on our thick glass table. Not perfect but saves a lot of time in the end.
5,cuts time in half and easy clean up,"we use the Apple master for coring, slicing, and pealing apples for pies and dehydrating apples with a little cinnamon. easy clean up cuts time in atleat half . easy to use, i put the apple on the fork thing and my 5 year old daughter does the restI would recomend this to a friend, infact i have"
2,apple peeler,I found this apple peeler difficult to use because it does not stay clamped or suctioned to the work surface and the apples are sliced differently. The apples also browned a lot faster for some reason.
2,Corer/peeler,"I was disappointed with this product.I bought it to peel & core apples in my restaurant and found out that in order to core the apple, you must also slice it in a thin, slinky type shape. This is not the way we need to slice the apple and we can not core it without doing so.It basically is back in the box and useless."
5,Totally useful amazing little invention,"This thing has made turning a bargain bag of 5lbs of apples into applesauce a 5 minute task. Slightly daunting instruction manual but it's not so complicated as it seems and once you get going it's totally brainless. Enjoy!TO make sugarless but perfectly sweet applesauce: peel, core and cut a pile of apples, stick em in a pot and steam in 1-1.5"" of water until they turn themselves into mush. 20-40 minutes. Freezes great too."
4,Easiest Method To Peel Those Apples,"My family loves all things apple,and in particular, apple pie. My apple pie takes at least 12 medium to large apples. It used to be a momentous task to peel all those apples. Talk about tired wrists!This peeler is so awesome. Easy to use and peeled the apple beautifully. I was actually surprised how easy it was to use. Sturdy and built well. Did not move while peeling apple. It could be one of the best kitchen gadgets! It saves so much time, and it works exactly like demonstrated. So wonderful if you have any hand issues and find peeling apples difficult. With arthritis, I was looking for something to help me with peeling apples. When this item arrived, I opened it, skeptically took everything out of the box. My daughter in law and daughter were watching as I placed an apple on the peeler and began to turn,,,,wow! We all cheered the results! So easy, so complete. The perfect apple peeler! Love it!""Highly Recommended. prisrob 01-17-13"
3,I really liked it until it broke..,"This apple peeler works quite well on big and small apples. Has a bit of trouble if you hit a mushy spot, but that's to be expected. The suction cup holds it to my counter quite well.That said, I used it for two months - maybe once or twice a week - and just the other day one of the prongs that holds the apple broke off. Haven't seen a way to fix it, but just keep an eye on this if you buy it!"
