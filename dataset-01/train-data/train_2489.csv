4,easy for beginners,"I like Denise Austin..I think she's cheesy, but I think the concept of targeting those ""female fat zones"" is great.I think it a good body workout minus the cardio. I don't think my heart rate got to a high point at all with this routine.I think it's more strengthening then anything. I like this workout..not to difficult, the pace was easy to keep up with and all in all great for when i was just starting out..I never felt overwhelmed with it.I thinks it's a great starter workout..not to easy where you get bored, good enough to feel like you have worked those muscles, and easy to follow."
3,Dissapointing,"I do like Denise Austin, but I also have her 10 Minute Target Toning DVD and within the first 5 minutes I was doing the same moves she does in the other DVD. I wanted a different workout, not more of the same. I didn't realize you need a stability ball for part of the exercises and I haven't gotten around to buying one yet. I think I will try the 2nd workout when I get my ball, but I was dissapointed with the other exercises."
3,comments from a lifelong excerciser,"Again, I have purchased a Denise Austin video only to turn around and sell it after a short period of time. Why? I keep buying them because Denise knows her stuff, and this is actually quite a good workout. I particularly enjoy the fit ball and feel it is one of the best additions to a daily workout. My only complaint with her workouts is the constant chatter. After a while I find I am unwilling to pop in one of her videos because I dont want to listen to her. This is really unfortunate as many will benefit from her expertise. My suggestion is to learn the routines, hit the mute button and put on some good music!"
4,Great Workout!!,"Ok, I'm not into the gym scene and I like to rotate my workouts. I've really enjoyed this workout because it's different. The stability ball is so much fun! I've been losing weight and staying fit with Denise's videos through three pregnancies and this is my favorite workout for toning. I've really noticed a change in my abs and my posture just after three weeks! This is an excellent workout!!"
2,"didn't help me shrink anything, ANNOYING","i just cannot seem to get lucky with any Denise Austin videos, she doens;t inspire me like a Leisa Hart does. This video was annoyingly bad, but I gave it 10 workouts and never felt like it was going to last. So, I tried it, tried again and again, and still do not like it. For those who like this woman, wow, i don;t get it, she is over the top and does some questionable stuff. I do not recommend this video at all."
2,unpleased,This was a boring workout. I was surprised for Denise Austin. Usually she is a pleasure to workout with but I just couldn't get into this one.
2,Squats Damaged My knees,The squatting exercises in this video caused one of my knees to have a lateral tracking patella (dislocated my kneecap). My orthopedic surgeon told me it was the squats with weights that probably caused the knee damage.The other exercises in this DVD are good but be careful.
1,Not impressed,I admire Denise Austin but can't say that I'm especially thrilled with any of her workouts. I bought this at the same time as buying 'Quick Fix' and much prefer that over this one. I need something fast paced yet that I'm able to follow and I need to feel like I'm doing something. I never feel like I'm getting anywhere doing Denise Austin. This is my 5th Denise Austin fitness dvd purchase and my 5th let down.
4,Nice DVD,"It's a good DVD, and doesn't overwhelm you like a lot of others. Good exercises for beginners. She is very chatty, and sometimes her voice is just plain creepy. But she does keep you motivated."
4,Very informative,Helps to know the areas that I need to work on to lose weight. It's very informative.
3,"Ok for beginners, but I'm not feeling the burn","This is an okay exercise if you're just starting out, but I work out (cardio and weights) 5 times a week and this video didn't help. It's great if you need an easy day if you're sore from an intense workout, but I wouldn't recommend it as your principle toning video.It does, however, get every area in 40 minutes. It's broken into 2 20-minute sessions. The first 20 is with just weights and the second 20 is with weights and a stability ball. In order to get the full effect I would recommend doing the entire 40 minutes. the first 20 doesn't hit every spot."
1,Poor Quality of Manufacturing,When I received this DVD I played it and there were only 2 chapters recorded on it. I sent it back and replaced it. When I received the second DVD the same thing happened. I love Denise Austin and her workout videos. I was looking forward to this one as it had two smaller time frame workouts on it. Needless to say I was disappointed. I have since received my refund.
1,Avoid this!,"To get right to the point, I hate this DVD. I've tried several different exercise DVDs, and this is definitely one I should have skipped. Denise has an incredibly annoying voice and I felt completely stupid trying to follow along with the motions. She moved very quickly, and I didn't feel like she held the stretches long enough to be effective. Also, I questioned the technique/form used in places. To be honest, I only got 5 minutes into the DVD before I stopped; maybe it picked up, but I consider it a bad sign that I couldn't stand it long enough to finish it even once. I have also used Leslie Sansone's Walk Away the Pounds DVDs - some reviewers felt that she was annoying, but Leslie is nothing compared to Denise."
4,Love this Workout!,"Denise definitely targets ""ALL"" of your female fat zones from your butt, thighs, front and back arms, love handles, upper tummy and lower tummy. If you use this video plus a cardio workout, you will definitely see the results of a slimmer you!"
3,good but not accurate,"The video is a good workout on its own. When I bought this with the book ""Shrink Your Female Fat Zones"", I assumed it would be a ""spot training"" video to actually go with the book; your own personal fat zone - IT DID NOT. It mixed them all up. On its own the workout is good, but DO NOT buy this video if you think it's going to go with the book in that sense."
1,"It wasn't the workout I was looking for, sadly","It wasn't Denise's perky attitude that made me not really enjoy this work out dvd, it was the exercises. I was looking for a work out that focuses more on 'old school' exercises like Bicep curls and what have you. If you're looking to really tone up your arms (especially the flab on the back of your arms, bleh) and everything else without any fru-fru workout plans, then I recommend ""The Science of Fitness with Tamilee - I Want That Body! by Tamilee Webb""."
4,Good workout but she is annoying,"This is a decent video and I work out a lot. I am definatly sore after the squats and lunges workout. Some of the exercises with the ball is uncomfortable and just difficult to gain balance but that could just be my issue. The one main problem is listening to her voice, she is really annoying and I think makes some inappropriate statements but not a huge ordeal..."
5,Give it a try!,"Had a baby 7 months ago and was completely discouraged when my once flat stomach became a flabby mess! I have lost all of the baby weight but the stomach remained so I decided to give this DVD a try. I tried it for the first time yesterday and I am completely sore today...a good thing! This DVD worked all the right areas. I did the full 40 minutes and am super excited to have found something that works the core and other ""fat zones"". As for Denise Austin, the negative reviews had me skeptical but after doing the DVD, I don't think she is that annoying. If she annoys you, use your mute button and crank up your iPod or stereo!I will update my review in 4 weeks or so with the results..."
4,Review,This is a great video. Good workouts especially since you can do them together or separately depending on how much time you have.
3,For Beginners!,"I love most of Denise Austin's videos, but this one is just not challenging. I would recommend this DVD to people who are just beginning to exercise of a regular basis or for people with ailments that prevent them from exploring full ranges of motion."
2,BORING!,"Oh she gets on my nerves. This dvd is so boring I only watched a couple of minutes of it and turned it off. If you want great sculpting moves with actual energy and fun,try Turbo Jam by Chalene Johnson. It's excellent."
5,for beginners and intermediates,"I think that this is great for beginners and intermediates. The moves are at a moderate pace, and things are explained well. I think it creates a great burn without over exerting, and you can feel it the next day. It is also low impact, so I can do this with my bad knee joints and all. I definetley have to alternate it with something else though. The tape also says it is 2 complete 20 min workouts, but they are actually two sections of a workout run together wiout a break in between."
3,One 40-minute workout in 2 sections,"I am annoyed that this dvd is advertized as ""two complete 20-minute workouts."" It is not two complete 20-minute workouts. It is one 40-minute workout with two 20-minute sections. If you only want to work out for 20 minutes you have to memorize where the chapter breaks are and keep reaching for your remote. Also, the cool-down is not its own chapter, so you have to fast forward to it. In my book, two complete workouts are two separate choices on the menu, each with their own warm-up and cool-down. That is not what this is. This is a 40-minute workout that you can cut up if you want to. As a 40-minute workout I am pleased with the dvd (see other positive reviews). It just isn't what it is advertised to be."
4,This is great!,"I just got this DVD along with a body ball which I've never used before. I'm a pretty new exerciser (trying to shed those pounds) and usually try to do some sort of cardio. Although this does not leave me breathless, it did get my heart rate up and made me sweat a little. I could definitely see myself doing this regularly. I have done other Denise Austin videos before. In my opinion she can be a little annoying if you don't like someone to talk all the way through while you workout (which she does), but she isn't as annoying as others I've seen. She doesn't do those ""woohoo""s and doesn't get all hyper. She's very soft spoken and encouraging to me. I especially liked the ab work which is my trouble zone. I could really feel the burn!! If you are an advanced exerciser, I wouldn't recommend this unless you're just wanting some good stretches and a little burn. But great for beginners/intermediates."
3,not for everyone,"Okay, let me just say upfront, Denise Austin is not for everyone. I thought she was too perky, too cheesy and she would talk incessantly. Seriously. Incessantly. The exercisers in the background didn't seem to have much personality either.The actual workout consists of two 20 minute workouts. The first part is pretty much a traditional workout with free weights. Nothing new there. Though I did like the butt blaster move. I liked the second workout with the stability ball better. Some transitions between exercises were a little fast, but still, not bad.Both parts focus on toning, cardio isn't really incorporated into the workouts. But if you can ignore Denise Austin's voice, the workout does work the areas you want to target. It's not the best workout video by any stretch of imagination, but it isn't bad for the price."
2,Good exercises. Had to turn off the sound.,"This is my first (and will be the last) Denise Austin's DVD. I read so many good reviews and have to try it. I had to turn off the sound and played my own music to do the workout. You gotta admit that her voice and non-stop talking could be really irritating. However, when you finally could focus on the TV screen, her image would be the next thing distracted you from the exercises. I personally felt that the way she bugged her eyes out all the time was scary to me.If you don't have strong feelings against the instructor and can follow through the whole sequence, the exercises can be very effective. They're the ones I also practice a lot in my gym classes. I think I'll just stick to my gym, since I don't wanna play this DVD again."
4,Good Workout,"Denise Austin provides a great workout. However, you need to have several pieces of equipment to make it happen: a mat, an exercise ball, and handweights. You can combine the 2 twenty-minute workouts into 1 forty-minute workout if you like. The only problem is that Denise talks too much and her voice becomes shrill after a while. If you can let that slide, this is a good workout."
3,Shrink your female fat zones,The exercises are good but she talks too much! Incessantly! She does not explain which muscles you should be working so you cannot be certain you are doing the exercises properly.
3,"A little psycho, but good workout","Denise Austin is a little creepy at times, but overall a good workout"
2,You have GOT to be kidding,"This might be a good work out, but I ended up laughing too much to do any of the actual exercises. Denise Austin is so completely distracting, you can't watch or listen to her at all. Which is really hard to do since she does NOT STOP TALKING for more than 2 seconds. Add that to the fact that she has an odd voice and bugs her eyes out. The whole thing reminded me way too much of something I would see on SNL or MadTV. I had too stop it halfway through and don't know if I could put up with her for the entire program! I wasn't sure if I should laugh at her or run in terror!"
5,Very fun and sexy!,"NBT is a like James Bond, only there's a really appealing female instead of an English man. Najica is a super spy for the government when she's not working as the President of the most successful perfume company in the world. The animation is very racy with gorgeous females in skimpy clothing in every scene and the action scenes are magnificant. This is a very ecchi anime with each episode like a rollercoaster ride. Najica's humanoid partner Lila is much like the character Chii from Chobits: ignorant at the beginning of the series, but she goes through a lot of character development until the end. This anime is pure eye candy. It's not meant to be a philisophical anime like Evangelion or .hack//sign. Instead, it's much like Cowboy Bebop in that Najica must find and retrieve a line of missing humanoids who are usually causing trouble in the world.Bottom line: This anime will keep you VERY happy for a few hours!!"
3,Nubidu's anime review,Same story throughout - bring the Hermits back alive (if you can). Story is repetative but enhanced by some good action sequences. Lots of undies fanfair for those who interested in that kinda thing (sometimes you wonder from which angle they were making this animation...)
3,I've seen better online games!,"I had much better expectations about this game. What frustrates me the most is the footspeed of the players. They move like snails. I couldn't stay in a rally for more than few seconds. This took away most of the enjoyment from the game The only way I could win points is by going to the net. Also, serving is simply ridiculous. Hard, well placed serves were the return winners for my opponent. Slow shots in the middle of the serving box were aces."
5,great banana hook,"If you're looking for a banana hook that is out of the way when not in use, this is the hook for you. Easily attaches to underside of upper cabinets and swings up or down depending on if in use or not. Will not last forever if you use it regularly. I purchased 2 so I have a back-up. Would definitely recommend!"
3,"Second Season, Little Promise",I'm not sure if I will purchase succeeding viewings because its looks like a reword of season one and it is heartbreaking to commercialize divorce of children like this.
4,Life After Wartime,"Harold and Barbara Rhodes visit France in 1948; a country coming to terms with the aftermath of war and occupation and an uncertain Europe.They stay at Beausmesnil Chateau. Misunderstandings arise. Is it cultural? Language barriers? Or a hostility towards the American couple and the country they are from which is dictating the peace with the USSR in a shattered Europe entering a new age....On face value, this seems a dull tale or travelogue with little action or plot,but it is the quality of Maxwell's writing that gives dimension;of human and international relations;how complex or sinister meanings are given to things that ultimately have no gravity or bearing at all.Maxwell keeps the readers interest throughout and the characters have real human depth. A fine book."
4,The Chateau,William Maxwell is a lovely writer and this was interesting. It concerned an American couple travelling in France soon after the end of the 2nd World War. I haven't seen another book set in France in this period so this made it fascinating. Most of the book was good but I felt that the last section lost the beauty of the earlier writing. It tended to become a bit of a travelog and I felt Maxwell wasn't sure how to finish the book. But he does write beautifully and is worth reading his prose for the joy of it and also for the period and people depicted.
3,This is NOT a gate,"This is not a gate, it's a fence. Gates open, this unit doesn't open once screwed together. It's a great little fence, but to me it's worthless as a gate."
5,I love Richell products,"This gate can be shortened or legthened and can be secured into a length. I keep mine non-secured, so I can move the pieces to open and close. I love it and it looks great, while keeping my dogs safe. LOVE Richell products and Amazon."
2,very fine appearance but not so sturdy,"I purchased this pet fence along with two different pet door gates from Richell. The door gates (not this fence) are perfect, very sturdy, easy to operate and all the Richell products are very nice looking and will fit right into any well furnished home but....this fence has 90 degree ends to stabilize the fence which is a great idea and worked fine until my wife scooted one of the ends against a wall at a slight angle. We heard a wood cracking sound and when we pulled the fence back away from the wall we saw that the top hinge that braces the stand had only about 3/16th of an inch of wood from the edge to where screws were inserted. Well, that 3/16"" wood sliver to which the top hinge was mounted had cracked away with only the slight pressure of my wife scooting the brace adjacent to a wall slightly off angle. Not well designed. The hinge should be twice the size that it is and have much more wood in between the edge and where the screws are drilled."
5,Met all expectations,"I ordered the taller version of this gate and am very glad I did. Our pet - a poodle - about 12-15 lbs, is well suited for this gate. She isn't trying to jump over it because visually it seems too high. Also, the gate is well made and heavy enough that she won't be able to shove it out of the way. The side panels allow her to see a larger area when we arrange the gate at an angle between two walls....like seeing around a corner. The ""feet"" of the gate are solid and there is no way the gate will tip over. Expensive, but worth it."
1,Broken and Shabby,"The area where the screws go into the woood was broken in two places, looks like when they disassembled the gate they had problems and just stuffed it in a box. This item shouldn't have cost more than $40 tops. Very disappointed."
5,Great price. Very versatile. Works well.,"My husband wanted a gate or some sort to block the entrance to our kitchen. Problem is we have an open concept kitchen / dining room area and the opening was really wide. We also have 3 50 pound dogs who could knock over a smaller gate.This gate solved the problem. It is completely free standing and separates into two pieces (you can permanently connect it but we opted not too). We can use one piece on one doorway, and the other piece on a different doorway. It has given us many options for keeping our dogs out of areas.The pieces are solid - and heavy. The dogs can't knock them over. We learned the first week that it is better to move them than try to step over them quickly. My husband caught the edge and the one piece fell over. He knocked the locking pin off but we were able to glue and screw it back on so that has nothing to do with the quality - just our clutziness.Overall, this is an exceptional product that I would recommend to anyone!"
5,Perfect,This gate is beautiful and is more like a piece of furniture than a doggy gate. It isadjustable for different openings but not easily...requires a screwdriver. I don't happen to need to adjust as my openings are all the same so it suits me well.
4,Love this gate,"I really love the Richell Wood Freestanding Pet Gate. I like that it is free standing and therefore does not mark up the walls and it looks nice - it isn't an eyesore. The only thing I don't like about it is that in order to adjust the width you need to get out the screw driver, but I can live with that. It is a little pricey, but it is good quality and it looks so much better than those crappy plastic gates. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a gate. In fact, I am considering buying another one."
5,Great gate for odd sized spaces.,"I have bought and returned three gates to use for our golden retriever puppy because they either didn't fit the door opening tightly or were a real pain to put together and operate. Even though this gate is expensive, it is heavy, tall and fits the odd sized openings that need blocking in our house. It would be nice if it had a swinging gate in it, but it's not that big of a deal to move it to get through. I squirted a non-staining, non-alcohol dog repellant on the top rail and so far the puppy (and our older dog) haven't tried to jump up on it or push on it. I like that it was so easy to put together and can be moved from one location to another without dismantling it or unhooking it from the doorway. And it's pretty."
1,Jumped it in two days,"We love the look of this gate (we got the tall one) and how easily it was assembled. However, our 11 lb pup got out within two days. She learned to put her feet on the crosswire and boost herself over. I called Richell - they were as nice as could be, but they could only suggest I return the item to Amazon. There is no present fix. They ARE designing a new gate that would help the problem. In the meantime, they have lovely crates that might do the job for you. I would suggest this gate only for dogs that are very small or are used to being confined. Good gate but way too clever dog!"
3,Well - It is OK,"I order this item Thursday and received it Monday, very quickly. Because I am not mechanically inclined, it took me a minute to figure out how to put it together. I was trying to have it assembled before my husband came home and I dit. I am changing my first review because, I have had this a few months and it is now a pain. The gate would be ok if you did not have to move it which becomes a chore. The side panel keep slipping loose and you have to reassemble it each time you move it."
4,Richell Freestanding Gate,Gate was easy to assemble and works fine. I use it to section off parts of my house from my dogs.
5,Review of large Richell Freestanding Gate,"This good-looking gate perfectly fits my needs. I was looking on-line for an elegant gate that was sturdy enough to prevent my dog from getting into the living room. It was easy to assemble, sturdy and matches the wood in the room. I bought the wide gate because I had a large opening and extra height just to make sure my dog couldn't jump over it. I am totally satisfied."
2,Disappointed,"When I purchase a book I look at all features offered with the book. E.g., if a book comes with a Learning CD I expect that cd to work with the product for which it was written. The CD that comes with this book requires QuickTime (Apple App) intead of MS Media player. This does'nt make sense.That is why I rate this pruchase with a lowly 2."
4,Almost real,"This cypress topiary is very close to looking real. The only thing I don't like is that instead of using real or simulated wood for the trunk of the tree it is a metal pipe. The spiral of the cypress does not cover enough of the pipe to conceal it. I tried painting the pipe with dark brown rustoleum but, it still shows enough to give away the fact that this tree is artificial. However, they look very nice in my outdoor entry & I've received compliments on them from passers-by who see them from a distance."
1,Not very helpful,Not sure why this book is getting such great reviews. I bought a ton of books before I entered law school and this was definitely one of the least helful. I'm perplexed by the ratings?!?@?
3,Pleasant uneventful house,Jori is quite a prolific producer of house. Unfortunately it sounds like it. The beat generators and bass effects use sounds from the late 80's and need to be updated. All in all the sound is pleasant but nothing ground breaking.
1,Disapointing,"Normally, if I get a book I don't like, I don't bother to write a review on it. However, I truely regret shelling out $ for the book and I want to make sure no one else makes the same mistake. It wasn't in the slight bit intresting. It had potential, the idea behind the story is good. However, the whole book seems very rushed. I'm not quite sure how to put it to words... it went too fast, in the bad way. Tathea, as a charrecter, is flat, and the supporting charrecters never stay long enough for you to get to know them.I would not spend any amount of money on this book."
2,Christian Propaganda Fails Despite Author's Skill and Talent,"Despite her genuine skill and talent, Anne Perry has hit a solid thud with ""Tathea,"" an obvious name in itself, 'Ta-Thea' indicating a connection with God (theo, thea being the Greek word for God, masculine and feminine). I am very sorry that this was my first Anne Perry book for it has put me off her work forever, I'm afraid. It is pure preachment and succeeds only as a work of Christian propaganda. It turned me off, even with its display of wan tolerance towards other religious viewpoints, as it assumes a superiority of origin. I believe it is revealing and that Perry has written what, for her, represents something deeply personal and genuine, but which, for me, and I'm sure for others, represents something despotically religious. Ultimately, it fails as literature because it has a clear agenda behind the story."
1,No feeling of 'world',"I was greatly disappointed with this book. Its the first book I have bought in a long time where I did not look at all the Amazon reviewers comments, and I regret that. It started well, but I only got 50 pages into it before I gave up. Character development is poor, you keep on feeling that you missed some important pages. Changing cultures on a daily basis gives it a cardboard feeling. I tried making excuses for it, but eventually I had to put it down. Not enjoyable at all. Unrealistic, trying to go through all the worlds religeons and philosophies in one story. A novel idea, but not a good read."
2,Hard to finish,"The story in the first part of the book was interesting. However, I found the remainder of the book repetitive, and I had to force myself to finish. I kept thinking there would be more to the story and that it would take a different turn. The message the book gives, however, is important."
2,disappointing,"I have always loved books written by Mrs. Perry but Thatea was a disappointment... I agree with previous reviewers that it comes out as a big christian propaganda.I was expecting a work of fictionnal fantasy not a tormented spiritual journey,using a relativelly tortuous story line for endoctrinement. I will still read Mrs. Perry and will even ""give a shot""to her next fantasy book. She is really a great writer!"
3,Overall I was disappointed in what could have been great.,"I applaud the author's attempt to combine science fiction (sort of) with a quest for spiritual meaning for our lives. The first third of the book was very slow and repetitive. The latter part of the book improved, yet the story lacked depth and didn't hold my interest. I cannot believe people have the audacity to compare it to C.S.Lewis or Tolkien--that is a put-down to 2 great authors. I would compare it more to The Alchemist by Paulo Cohelo."
1,Awful book,"If I had known this would be a contemporary version of Pilgrim's Progress instead of a fantasy, I wouldn't have tried to read it. I didn't like the first Pilgrim's Progress and this book is worse. It is a grueling read and if you don't agree with the author's view of God and life before openingthis book, I doubt the ""novel"" will bring you around. This book is tedious and didactic -- not spiritual."
2,I love Christan fiction but this was something else,"I had to start this book twice it was just difficult. The theology wasn't hidden but that in itself doesn't bother me a great deal. I love Christian fiction, it gets me thinking about what I believe and why. Tathea however, was actually uncomfortable to read. I wanted to stop several times and plowed on. It had me thinking that maybe I just was uncomfortable because of some truth it had, like when I read difficult sections of the Bible. That is not why. The theology made me uncomfortable, I would rather read then Bible than this book. If I want Christian fiction I will read it, but this felt more like subtle brainwashing. Eh, the story resonated with me but the detractors are too great for me to read it again."
1,Tathea by Anne Perry,"I'm normally not motivated to write book reviews, but this book was so bad I decided to say something. Like other naive buyers, I was seduced by the glowing reviews on the cover and the fact that I like Anne Perry's mysteries. Believe me, this book was nothing at all like her mysteries.The book is so much quasi-spiritual pap written in flowery language. There is no story. There is no plot to speak of. There are flat inhuman characters. There is, however, a great deal of lofty sermonizing.If you have converted to Mormonism like Anne Perry, you might like this book. Otherwise steer clear of it and spend your money on something else."
2,Please--Back To Victorian England,"Ms. Perry should stick with her novels set in Victorian England. I have read all of them, so when I saw a new book by Anne Perry, I immediately purchased it. What a disappointment! Boring. The characters were so unlifelike. I love fantasy, but this was too far out for me."
2,Disappointment,"There was an article about this book in the local paper and I became intrigued by the underlying religious tones and focus. I soon put this book on hold at the library. While I waited for this book, I read another one of Anne Perry's novels, which was actually entertaining and worth reading. However, when I finally began to read ""Tathea"", I soon found disappointment, no matter how hard I tried to like the novel (I did really want to like the novel). I must admit, I was unable to complete the novel. The beginning jumps around way too much and the author seems to be in some sort of hurry. She lost me."
2,What a guise!,"I bought this book because I wanted to break into the fantasy novel genre with something that wasn't ultra famous. In all reality, it is a fantasy novel for the Christian book genre readers, but it was disguised as a regular fantasy book novel. I didn't appreciate that very much. The strong religious undertones took away from the novel (I actually completed it) but the discriptions and the writing were terrible. Perry is too wordy with the language and almost nothing had a physical discription beyond the clothes one wore or the kind of stone at the locale.It is a good book for youths or people looking to buy different kinds of Christian novels, but it is not a fantasy book for fans of that genre."
2,Too religious,"Tathea was not what I expected from a book billed as a fantasy novel. I bought it thinking that it would be a nice escape from reality not realizing that it is fact not a fantasy book so much as it a religious novel. For those of you who enjoy religious works, you may very well enjoy this book. However, if you do not, I strongly suggest finding another book. I have read one-half of the book and do not plan on completing it. I am disappointed that the back of the book was not more forthcoming on the nature of the work."
1,Long Long Journey,"I wish I had read the other reviews before trying to plow my way through this book. I like fantasy, I like Anne Perry. But, I just could not finish this book. By the first fourth I really did not care what happened to Tathea (or anyone else for that matter). Very one deminsional. Not up to her usual standard."
3,A journey of the mind and soul,"I found Tathea a very interesting book to read. The author is very descriptive in her detail of suroundings and layout of the world in which the story takes place in. I could easily imagine myself caught up in the scenes taking place.Tathea brings to the world a Book containing the words of God with His plan in it. She attempts to share it with the people, but, along with bringing the truth it contains, she also brings evil. She eventually must make decisions to remove to book from the populace so that the truth will not be fully distorted.I do wish Tathea was not totally left alone in her quest to accomplish all that she must do. Every time she makes a friend, he or she dies for the cause of truth so Tathea can succeed with the next step of her destiny.There is another book, and I anxiously await it. Maybe in the sequel Tathea will find the happiness and peace that she deserves in this life, without having to wait for the one to come."
4,I liked it,"I thought Tathea was quite an interesting book. It was different from the Historical Fiction I usually love to read, but I liked it. I had a harder time near the beginning through Tathea's spiritual journey because the settings were changing so fast, but I really enjoyed the second half. Through the story line and characters there were many good points made symbolically about good vs.evil, and about growth through experience and knowlege. I also could relate to her little glimpses of her spiritual journey she couldn't quite remember. I'm sure it's a book I'll reflect back on often."
1,A cure for insomnia,"I'll be brief. I love Anne Perry's work. Although I'm a huge fan of William Monk and Hester and I love the Thomas and Charlotte Pitt myteries, this book was sleep inducing. There are 522 pages of religious ramblings that could have been condensed into 200. I'm sorry to say, reading this was a waste of time."
2,Beautiful but bequiling,"As an enthusiastic Anne Perry fan, I jerked this book up as fast as I could when I saw it in the ""New Books"" section of the library. It was a little difficult to get into but the beautiful descriptive language and fantasy lands snagged me. The imagery is easily seen as an aligory of Judaeo-Christian themes. However, I must caution readers that there are very definite doctrinal themes that are definitely those of the Mormon Church or the Church of Jesus Christ of Later Day Saints. These differences are what distances it from orthodox Biblical Christianity and the reader should be aware of this before reading this book. I will not be reading the sequels."
5,Cary Grant....enough said!,"Little known, but one of the BEST Cary Grant movies around. The characters are delightful and the story wonderful! Get this one for your collection!!"
4,Good movie,"The movie is pure sentimentalism, but it has it's fun moments and some good lines. I'm sure it made a strong statement in the era during which it was produced. A different kind of film for Cary Grant, but if you like him, it's worth watching."
1,Cary Grant - Male Gynecologist,"Honestly? P.U.despite being a huge Cary Grant fan, I can't buy him in this role. both the character (selfless gynecologist to the down-trodden, amateur orchestra conductor, sensitive soul, all 'round renaissance man) and grant's performance (all over the map) are far too precious to be taken seriously. or even comically. which may be the problem w/ the film: the odd mixture of satire, moralizing, and cautionary anti-mccarthy tale just doesn't hang together well.I'd write this off as yet another retread of hollywood's ham-handed self-congratulatory liberalism. if you're looking for vintage mank, stick w/ ""all about eve;"" for classic cary, ""north by northwest."""
1,Lame movie,"Insipid, uninspired and Cary Grant is wasted in the role; not Jeanne Crain, though...you expect this kind of tripe with her in it."
1,Ghastly,"Among the worst movies I've ever seen, ""People Will Talk"" is a confused, pontificating, gassy mess. The direction is non-existent and the acting (with Hume Cronyn the only notable exception) awful. Avoid."
1,Can this bomb really be from Joseph L. Mankiewicz,"I love Cary Grant films, and I love Makiewicz, but this film is a significant disappointment in both of their careers. Far from engaging, this is one of the low-points in both of their careers.Not recommended!"
3,not very realistic,"This was okay, as movies go, but kind of unbelievable as reality goes. But, I prefer the old movies over most of what is offered today, so I would watch it again!"
5,Another Great Cary Grant Movie I Never Knew About!,"The asbolute best scenes of the movie are at the end, when Mr. Shunderson (Finlay Currie) tells the story of his past and then tells Professor Rodney Elwell (Hume Cronyn) off with some of the best lines ever...Short and to the point! I never knew of this movie and happened upon it late one night on AMC. See the film, it's one of those C.G. movies that sneak up on you, grab your attention and leave you smilling at the end, glad that you stuck with it."
1,Worst experience EVER! NO STARS!!!,"I normally do not write reviews. I look to see what other people have said before I buy, but when everything goes well, I just move on. Not this time! I have been buying from Amazon for years now. This is the first time that I have not received my product. I ordered it on 5/3 and supposedly it was shipped on 5/5, however when I still did not have it on 5/29 I tried to contact the seller. I did not get a response. I am now working with Amazon to try and get my money back. I felt this seller had good feedback, but now I would not trust them at all. I would give NO STARS if it would let me!!!!!"
5,People Will Talk,"Yet another sparkling, witty comedy by writer-director Mankiewicz (who was coming off a double Oscar win for ""All About Eve"" and ""A Letter to Three Wives""), ""Talk"" lives up to its billing. Sophisticated and daring, the film coasts along on ceaselessly smart dialogue adapted from the play by Curt Goetz. Grant's Praetorius is a progressive who believes the mind can be an instrument of healing, and the actor gratefully chews up his scenes, especially when he's required to lecture his peers. Cronyn's perfect as the spiteful sourpuss, while Finlay Currie (as a mysterious helpmate) and Walter Slezak (playing a model-train-loving scientist) round out an excellent supporting cast. ""Talk"" puts a quirky human face on academics you're going to love."
4,One of my all time favorites.,"People Will Talk is one of my favorite movies of all time. I may be a little biased because I love Cary Grant but this is definately on of his better works, and the film is sweet and sentimental. The dialogue is very well written, though its delivery is a little dry at times. The use of the Acedemic Festival Overature by Brahms is great. All together, People Will Talk is a cheery, entertaining movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a light watch."
4,Nice collection,"Hours of great viewing. Brings me back to when my family would all gather in the livingroom to watch the show back in the 1970's. One very annoying feature however is the packaging of almost each season is different. Some are in book form other in individual jackets within the season case. Season 2 is the worst package design. If you want to view disk 3 you must remove disk 2 as well.....same goes for disk 4 and 5.Getting back to the show...takes place in the 1930's during the depression years...given the tough economic situation of today, it can demonstrate to us all how a family can manage to cope and make do with what they got."
3,"I ""Say YES!""...","...to this vendor! I am thankful, both for the overall product, although, as I'm sure most bargain hunters would feel, there is still a part of me that wishes, considering the age of the album (and the fact that it is a cassette), the price might've been a bit lower. Still, I'm glad you guys found it for me!"
3,Not bad but...,The reading part is two spots at the bottom of the lense. I thought I was getting bi-focals. Once I got used to them they are fine but not what I thought.
2,To Say the Least,Went fishing and these were very irritating to wear. Bifocal bubbles were glued on both inside and outside and up too high on lens. Tried to push frame down lower on nose but that was too uncomfortable. Polarization was very good but had to take these off to fish.
5,Great Fishing Glasses,My distance vision is still good but I have trouble baiting a hook. These were the perfect solution at a fraction of the cost of prescription sunglasses. Polorized too.
2,Oasis Optics Fishing Bifocal,"The Oasis Optics fishing Bifocal Sunglasses Reader Polarized are fine for the purpose that i will be using them. The Bifocal part could be just a little larger for a bigger field of view. I am satisfied with my purchase, I got what I paid for with this purchase."
1,"Distracting, and odd-looking","Looks like a good idea, but I found that the bifocal portion was distracting when not looking through the small lower magnified portions of the lens. They also have a bug-eye appearance to them. For an all around better alternative, try the Dewalt bifocal safety glassesDewalt DPG59-220C Reinforcer Rx-Bifocal 2.0 Smoke Lens High Performance Protective Safety Glasses with Rubber Temples and Protective Eyeglass SleeveLess money, better quality, better looking and impact-safety protection as well. I now own several pair of the DeWalts (car, shop, truck, etc) and am very satisfied."
1,Poor quality,"Poor quality! I bought these sunglasses for my fishing expeditions. They worked fine during a few trips, but after six months of occasional use one of the temples broke spontaneously, while I was wearing the glasses, right in the little hole where the hangers are tied. Three days later the other side broke exactly the same way."
1,Ear piece broke after three months,I'm glad I waited to give these glasses a review. The ear pieces have rubber inserts that make this part of the glasses fragile. Mine broke after about three months of occasional use. I was disappointed as these glasses were quite handy for reading my GPS while on my motorcycle. The reader lenses are lighter in tinting. The position of the readers worked well for me.I paid about 12$ for a cheap pair of polarized sunglasses that have lasted for years so I know other sunglasses companies can make durable products.
2,A Note on Notes From Madoo,"He's a much better garden designer than author, I'm afraid. The book was dry and pretentious, and I felt it was a waste of money. Photos I've seen of his garden were, on the other hand, exciting and inspirational! Bummer."
4,steady and educational,"This 1925 work is an educational adventure. Christopher is a young man who is out of school for some time to let his ""eye's rest"" by order of the doctor. He is not allowed to read, so to pass the time he goes to work with his father, who owns a jewelry store. While there he befriends an elderly clock repair man, and gets an education about the history of clocks. The sub plot, is a theft by slight of hand, Christopher witnesses, and is involved in catching the thief's.The educational pieces are well balanced through the story, and include dialog between Christopher and his mentor. The adventure never really grabbed me, but it did make an interesting addition to the story."
5,Vivicam 4000,"This has been such a wonderful camera. I purchased it for $199 in May 2005. The sharpness cannot be beat. However, I recently needed to get a replacement because my toddler got a hold of it and somehow jammed the lens (it won't go back in or back out all the way and just won't work anymore ""ERROR 2"").At Christmas, I ended up getting my hubby a Canon Powershot S2 IS - which is just too bulky to tote around and doesn't take such sharp photos! I was disappointed because I thought it would be at least close to the Vivitar quality.The replacement camera I chose for myself was the Vivitar 6320. It is a very nice camera too, but the DELAY seems even longer. Plus, I was so spoiled with the long-lasting rechargable battery of the 4000, that I'm not sure I can get over it. The 6320 takes AA batteries which need to be changed after a dozen or so photos (I haven't tested them shooting video yet.) So, if you have the Vivitar 4000 camera...take good care of it. It's the best!!!"
4,This camera is the same as the Traveler DC6300 from Aldi,"Which is where I bought mine.It is a great value little digital camera, and competes really favourably with the Canons et al of this world.Prints are fine and crisp.The blurriness mentioned in a comment above is a complete non issue, since it is a phenomenon common to ALL other cameras. When taking pictures at low light without flash, even a trustly SLR will give you a blurry image if you can't hold it steady while the shutter is open for longer.However, beware of battery problems. Mine stopped being able to hold any charge after 1 year of ownership and I was forced to buy replacements.My father bought the same camera at the same time and had exactly the same battery problem as well.But for that it would have been 5 stars."
3,Cute Cover,It doesn't really provide much information about nude photography but is entertaining enough for the price. The 'Nude in Nature' title had me expecting some nudist style photography but this is more of the typical mild erotic style adult photography. If you find Family Naturism photography or videography a fun escape then the real Naturist DVDs on Amazon from RussianBare are really the best but they do cost more. If your looking for some fun posed shots this DVD will deliver.
1,A waste of time,"Watching this was a waste of time. Making it was a bigger waste of time. This DVD involves a photographer taking pics of several nude models. It's all pretty boring, there is nothing noteworthy going on. Afterwards they do an interview of the model, but she is clothed (a nude in ""nature"" but clothed, come on!) This was a big disappointment and I cannot recommend it."
1,"Don't buy, Don't rent, Don't see","I purchased this movie as part of a ""package deal"". I sent it back to Amazon and received about half the purchase price back. I consider myself lucky! This is a very poorly made movie that has no value or purpose. Basically, buyers are paying for the producer's trip to other countries. These are not the models that one would expect based on the title. I'm certain that they must be nice people, but I wouldn't consider them to be models. Buy a Play Boy dvd instead. You'll be much more satisfied. If you are an ammature photographer seeking professional tips on how to take better photos, you won't get them from this dvd."
2,Nudes in Nature - Innocent and Naked,"This was not a good DVD for learning how to take photos of models. In fact, it didn't give anything at all about how to take photos. I learn nothing at all from this DVD. This DVD is nothing more than a soft core porn DVD, not that there is anything wrong with that. However, this DVD should have been teaching people about how to take photos."
3,Another fine-otopia,"Survive! was exciting the whole way. Kurt gets himself into plenty of trouble, and I liked the way his family and dinosaur friends pulled together to help. As usual, the friendly, talking dinosaurs of Dinotopia are hard to accept. Things seem a little too lovey dovey. Among newer dino novels, Dinosaur Wars by Hopp has - how shall I put it? - a little more bite. Still, Survive was a fun, rather light read."
2,Boring,"The game plays as an action RPG, and while there is some strategy in how you level your character the game basically comes off as a button masher. There is only one town and you don't even have to talk to anybody to advance in the game. There is a bit of replay value with four different types of charactes to choose, but I was really too bored to even bother with it."
2,Disappointing New Shining Release,"For those who don't know this is one of many in the series of Shining Force games from the Sega platforms. If you were a fan of those games, this one will probably come as a disappointment to you. I bought this game and was so excited that finally US fans had a new ""Shining"" game. I started playing, and the gameplay had been changed sooo much that it was nothing like it predecessors. Instead of controling a whole army of people with various attacks, it was more like a crappy Zelda game. You take control of one character and just hit away at the enemies in real time, taking away the best part of the Shining series, the battle system. If you are a die hard Shining Force fan you may like this game, but probably not."
4,Good camera for the money,"This camera is good enough, I bought a 128MB SD wich made it even better. The pictures I take with it are nice, one just have to be aware of the resolution range, the one resolution you'll need for a specific shot, if you learn to go on with this, pictures are gonna come out fine. I would like that this camera had audio for video recording, but I think can't ask too much. For you folks who are scared about this camera eating batteries just buy rechargeable."
5,LUV dis one,"Yes it is a battery eater but the good news is that it only needs 2 AA's. I also wish the lens door had a little more tension on the closing clik. All this talk about battery cnsumption baffles me. It's only a fraction of FILM CONSUMPTION! For a simple cheap camera the quality is superb. I wish the video mode had audio though, You can do depth of field adjustment on it which is great on a point and shoot. The LCD is a bit small but it holds up well outdoors in bright light. It comes with a nifty pouch too. The 2 x digital zoom actually WORKS! Of course I use Kodak Ofoto for all my prints so that may be why I love it so.Spanky Camera"
3,Decent Low-End Point and Shoot with a defect,"I purchased this camera used several years ago.Seems to take OK pictures for a 4 MP when you want to grab a shot quickly.For some reason the camera will not retain the date and time setting that go away every time the camera is shut off. It will go back to 2004, this caused a lot of incorrect time stamps to be put on a series of photos. I don't know if that is normal for this model as it is the first time I have seem this with a digial camera.With much higher MP cameras now available for under $100.00 this is not worth more than $50.00 even in the best of conditions."
1,Had this a few years ago...,"I was given this camera a few years ago as a starter camera. It was a total piece of junk. All the pictures were blurry, the flash only occasionaly worked, and the front part that slides open would get stuck all the time. I only used it for a few months before I bought myself a camera that was worth a darn."
1,Cheap,"I bought this from walmart, and have since gotten another camera. This camera was complete crap. All the pictures came out blurry!! My new camera is much better, same MP, pictures come out much better, and much more options. Get a Nikon Coolpix! Best cameras ever made. Trust Nikon."
4,"If your kids are Super Mario Bros obsessed like mine, thiey'll love it!","The eyes on this toy are just sticker stuff and they start to come off and at times little seams come open and I have to sew them up, but my boys love love love to live out their video games with these dolls."
3,Doesn't look much better in person,I was hoping that when he arrived he would look better then his picture did. He doesn't really. I don't think they really captured Wario's nose very well. It really hides his eyes.
2,TEKKEON ET3000 ezTalker Digital Bluetooth Headset,"I liked the product; it was easy to pair and the sound was clear but, when the headset was on my ear comfortably, the microphone was pointed up, not toward my mouth. To get the microphone even part way pointed toward my mouth, I had to rotate the headset on my ear in such a way that was not only not comfortable but it did not stay in position. Ultimately I returned the item and got a Plantronics Voyager 510."
4,Best ending in the world!,"This book keeps you on the edge of your seat. Not only is the protagonist the most awesome (and likable!)tough gal, but the ending of the story is one of the most satisfying ever!!"
2,One Hit Wonders: K-Tel couldn't locate the originals?,"These are remakes-not the original versions. I bought the album strictly because it is the only listing for the Original Caste's ""One Tin Soldier"", the first and superior hit version. I was disappointed to find it was a remake. However, the remake is still preferable to Coven's cover a year later, and that is why I gave the CD 2 stars instead of 1. Original versions of the other songs are readily available, so keep looking instead of wasting your money on this CD. Of course, if you are the type who buys an album to get 4 or 5 outtakes of a song, it's your money."
1,Remakes - Not Originals,"As a previous reviewer has indicated, all selections except ""Precious And Few"" by Climax are remakes. If you want the original versions, go elsewhere."
1,All Re-Records,DON'T BUY THIS! This is an album of re-records. They are not the original hit versions!
1,CAUTION - REMAKES!!!,"I should know better by now than to buy before checking reviews first. Like others have already said - REMAKES!!! If you don't mind the stale sound usually associated with hit remakes, go ahead and order it. If you like the true sound of the originals, look elsewhere."
1,"Garbage, they're all garbage","Listen carefully to the samples, most of these ""oldies"" collections are NEW VERSIONS. Some by the original artists and some not, none that I have heard are the ones you remember...I can't find ANY actual anthologies here or in stores. Look for the line ""new stereo recordings by the original artists"" or some such comment, these collections are ripoffs!"
2,Beware of re-recordings,"Whenever you see an artist listed as, for example, ""Jerry Corbetta formerly of Sugarloaf"" instead of just ""Sugarloaf,"" you know it's a re-recording. I don't always mind hearing an alternate version of a song, but I want to know that up front. The cover art should display such a disclaimer prominently. Sorry, I don't think two lines of fine print across the bottom is prominent enough."
1,Captain Past,"Had it not been for a personal decision to read all the Hugo winners and nominees, I don't think I would ever come across Danger Planet, the 18th adventure of Captain Future, the ultimate space gunslinger, and his benevolent gang. Now, I wouldn't start to point out Captain Future's plot holes, improbabilities and campness, because this would mean I should have to write a very long review, which would be pointless.However, what really bothers me is the retro Hugo nomination. I mean, seriously? There was nothing better back in 1946 to get shortlisted? This is very much like including Borat in the Best Picture Oscar nomination list.Having said that, Danger Planet would be fantastic, if you were 10 years old back in 1945. Unfortunately, today's 10 year olds are way too sophisticated. Captain Future, you may forever rest in peace."
3,Swinging on only 3 stars,"Little known musical with many well known tunes; however, the performers don't measure up to the usual Broadway caliber. Their renditions are serviceable and entertaining bus miss on spirit and delivery. In several tunes the male lead can be heard sliding onto the proper pitch. It is worth price to expand your Broadway show collection and for the Johnny Burke tunes. Not a must have but definitely a nice to have for the Broadway Shows collector. I have listened through 3 times and doubt that I will listen to it much more than once per year in the future."
4,good project for 3 year old,Gave this to my 3 year old grandaughter for her birthday and she worked very hard to paint it. It was fun and is now a nice keepsake for her. she is crazy about elephants.
2,Full of holes,"Not only is the plot full of holes, the situations are highly unlikely and the end leaves you wondering if someone cut off the back of the book. To add to that, the setting is primarily the U.S. but it is full of British spellings and phrasing. Surely by now the Brits know we spell things differently."
5,Happy fan,This is our second rug. First one lasted in a teenager boy's bathroom for 5 years. Time to refresh and it looks great.
2,Poorly made,"I bought this rug for my husband's ""man cave"" but once we received the rug we noticed it's really poorly made so he doesn't even use it. The colors look slightly off, and the circle isn't exactly a circle. If you're not too picky the rug's good enough, but if you want all your Yankees stuff to look perfect like my husband don't bother buying it. I thought about returning it but didn't want to pay the shipping so we just gave it to a friend who isn't picky like my husband."
5,works well with windows 7 media center but...,"this TV Tuner is great with windows 7 media center, however, if you want to use its remote(the remote rather sucks so it isn't a big loss, not to mention the remote refuses to acknowledge windows media center at all and there are no fixes for that) you are stuck with the TotalMedia 3 Software, which for some reason will lock out a lot of channels on cable....don't get me wrong the TotalMedia 3 Software is nice other than that, but the tuner just works better with windows 7 media centerfor the price listed here however I suggest a different tuner, this one is definitely not worth more than $40 USD tops and that is pushing it"
4,Still relevant today,"Very in depth and detailed book. You can tell two things from reading this.1. That Konrad Lorenz loved what he did and did it with a passion unlikely to be exceeded by anyone.2. That he didn't miss much of anything.This is not my field so keep in mind this review is for the amateur like me. The book bogs down a little in places due to the detail the author emphasizes. This attention to detail is, of course, also what makes the book so good. It is the little details and observing every little movement and action then using the information gathered through those thousands of hours of close scrutiny to form conclusions as to why animals behave the way they do that makes this work a time tested masterpiece. My warning would be to be ready for this level of detail and you will be rewarded with a deeper understanding of the world around you and our own nature. The difficulty of the book is far exceeded by the rewards gained."
5,This is a must-have!,"My favorite tracks are ""My Silent Love"" ""An Old Piano Plays the Blues"" and ""What Do You Know about Love"". However, the entire CD is super. Freddy really understands what he is singing about and is able to touch your soul. Whether on disk or in person, you always feel he is singing to you personally. The up-tempo numbers truly show off his ""swingin style"". Try this one, you'll love it."
3,Powerpoint 2007 for Dummies,I found this book a little confusing. I've purchased books for Dummies in the past and found them all extremely easy to understand. I'm still at sea regarding understanding PowerPoint 2007.
2,I am a Powerpoint Dummy!,I was desperate for PowerPoint help for an upcoming presentation. I must be really bad because this book got me nowhere. Sigh. I ended-up hiring someone to put my presentation into PowerPoint.
4,Power Point 2007 For Dummies,I have read many differnt areas of this book and have found the author to be both entertaining and simple to understand. This book is not one you read from front to back it is designed to be used to look up certain areas of interest in using PowerPoint. I find this book covers the program very well and helps give pointers on how to use your PowerPoints with Microsoft Producer for creating Videos for the Web. I would recomment this book for those who want to go deeper into the program.
4,"Powerpoint, one of Microsoft's Better Products.","I recently purchased Microsoft Office Standard 2007 from one of Amazon's venders. I purchased this book because I love the ""Dummies Series"" of books because they are written with the every day person in mind. I would recommend this book for anyone who wnts to learn more about the particular program..Powerpoint."
5,16 of her best jazzy and soulful ballads on one CD.,"This superb compilation focuses on slow-tempo ballads which Phyllis recorded from 1985-95. ""Walk Away"", ""Old Friend"", ""Give Me One Good Reason To Stay"", ""Why Not Me?"", ""Living All Alone"", ""Souveneirs"" and ""First Time Together"" are among her most gorgeous and heartwarming ballads. Phyllis is truly missed by all her fans but her music remains timeless."
3,"Good CD! But, it is almost an identical to the original from 1997! It just has a different title!","i have never seen anything like this by any artist. howe has 2 cd's on here, one is ""Tangled in Blue"", his solo project from 1997, and this one is almost identical, except for one additonal song (the last one), just with a different title. i suggest buying the 97 cent ""Tangled in Blue"" and download the bonus track on this one (""How It Could Have Been."")"
2,Great Voice Forgot To Rock,"First thing that I thought was what a great song but after 5 tracks I was beginning to wonder how come Brian forgot to bring the rock and roll... The albums produced to the max and his voice is stellar. The album is dull to a degree because of the sameness from track to track. Not a rocker in the bunch until the tenth track which is only somewhat upbeat. I can't bash the album because the songs again are good songs just simular. I would have loved to hear him blast something in the vien of ""Tied Up In Love"" from Penetrator or even a poppy ""How About That"". He sounds as if he can still sing the hell out of a song but he went the way Cheap Tricks, Robin Zander did on his painfully slow/boring over produced self titled album. But atleast the ballads here are well crafted and sang with Brian undeniable soft rasp. Could have been a much better album."
1,Received wrong item,"philosophy the supernatural airbrush canvas spf 15 - beigeI was sent the wrong color of this product, received on 5/9/08, quickly after order, I immediately returned the product on 5/10/08, per instructions from customer service. I was told they do not replace the product, but make a refund. On 5/19/08, I called to see if they had received the returned item, and was told that it had been received and they were in the process of making the refund. It is now May 31, and I still do not have the refund debited to my account. I will call again on Monday June 2 to followup. I will not purchase from this company again."
1,Wrong Color...,When I go back and look at my order it says that I have order beige not medium beige. I absolutely love this product but this is the wrong color from what I order
3,Sheer make-up,"The foundation is very sheer/powder form. I like it, but it hardly provides coverage and also, you have to clean the puff yourself, you can't buy replacements. When you clean the puff, it takes awhile to dry - about a day and a half. So then you can't use it or have to put it on with your hands or a throw-away sponge. I have sensitive skin, so this works well for my skin, but because I don't want to use the same used puff daily and it takes too long to dry and it's difficult to get the powder on the sponge to put on your face, I give it a 3."
3,dirt,I loved the feel and ease of this makeup but the color looked like dirt on my face. i was told that if you have any tan at all to order the bronze. i get very dark in the summer and this was still too dark for me.
3,Not as much coverage as I hoped,"I was so excited to receive this makeup as I read so many excellent reviews. However, I am a bit diappinted, as I usually am with powdered makeup. I don't feel I get enough coverage, and I also feel the color is a bit off. It is quick an easy to apply, though. I also wish I could find refill sponges for the applicator."
2,Not what I expected,"Color was off too orange, not great coverage. Getting to powder was a pain container/applicator useless. The powder was clumpy as well"
5,This is great!!,"I love this product, it covers very well and also protects never oily! love it! I have rosacea and it covers up the redness well without irritating, goes on easily too!"
2,Doesn't seem like the same product,"Used to buy from Sephora until Philosophy discontinued. I want to love this, but it just doesn't look the same on my face as the exact same shade when I used to get it at Sephora. Coverage is not as good and it looks cakier. So disappointed."
3,"Great product, poor applicator","I love the product, but the applicator is dreadful. I use a kabuki brush to apply it. There are a lot of reviews that say the product arrives with a used sponge. I think what is happening here is that the seal between the power and the applicator comes loose and some of the product is transferred through the sponge in transit. I honestly don't know why Philosophy doesn't sell this like any other loose powder, without the horribly designed applicator. I would give it 4 stars if they sold it like that.The powder itself gives excellent coverage. It does have a sheen to it; if you are looking for a matte powder you should look elsewhere. I also wish the would offer a translucent or 1 shade lighter. Their lightest color only works for me during summer months.Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision."
3,suspicious,"I automatically order this item so that it is sent to me every two months. I love LOVE love the product and the service, however the last one shipped to me seemed to only be half full??? I'm going to have to put in an order in now for another one and I have not had this one a month yet. ??? I paid for a full product, didn't get the full product?????"
4,Really helpful,"I'm very bad in history and to top it off I had the worst U.S History teacher my freshman year. She was the worst history teacher ever. No one ever did her work and she gave out easy grades. She barley taught anything and I was really worried that I was going to fail the regents. So a week before the regents I went and bought this book. I studied a lot of the questions and reviewed the ones that I didn't understand too well. One week wasn't enough for me to learn everything, but I learned a lot. I ended up getting an 80 on the regents. Although it is the lowest out of all the regents I've taken, I was very happy I passed! Definatly recommend this book."
4,mixed review,"There are a lot of things that I like about this one-hour workout. For example, she takes you through a great shoulder flexibility routine and also does a lot of rapid sun salutations that are great for core strength and really work the arms with a lot of plank/chatarongas. However, it starts out strangely and doesn't set the tone by simply breathing or doing a simple meditation. Also, there is no music which is a little weird. I also found myself wishing I could hold some of the poses, like down-dog, for an extended period. I felt that a focus on flexibility was really lacking in this program. All in all, I think it's a great program for developing core strength, and you can really work up a sweat, but I would definitely want to complement it with a program that focuses on holding poses for increased flexibility."
5,Terrific,"This is a great yoga practice. Very careful teaching, spiritual as well as physical exploration. The only criticism I have is that she should talk a lot less during savashana. I love her work and will buy more of her DVDs, and would seek her out for lessons in person."
1,Waste of Money,"I found this dvd to be lousy. First of all, Ana Forrest has a hard, unloving energy. She demonstrates a few postures and that's it. Nothing extraordinary, no great new ideas. There is a special features section where she is doing yoga/gymnastic tricks with her husband and I felt like I shouldn't have been there watching. Don't waste your money on this dvd! I enjoyed the following much more: Power Yoga with Bryan Kest, Ashtanga Yoga with Nicki Doane, and Baron Baptiste's Power Yoga series."
3,Difficult to place batteries in slots correctly,"I am surprised I am the only one honest enough to comment on the difficulty in placing the batteries!Eventually you get the hang of it, but it's not a simple pop in and forget.You have to place them at the correct angle then push them in hard to make sure they 'click' into place.They can pop out if not clicked into place.otherwise the thing works ok so far..Could be easier to read status on the lcd, tiny tiny words..."
1,You've got to be kidding me!!!,Not worth the money... Not at all worth the money... If it was $15 maybe. Display needs a brighter light. The display needs to be larger. The unit is slow to charge.
1,Dangerous,I came home to find the power transformer case in 2 pieces and a bunch of blackened and swollen electronics components inside - it had overheated and exploded during the second use. Probably lucky the house hadn't burned down as well.
1,Do not buy this product,"Good seller serviceBut the product becomes very hot, the product ruined at least eight brand new battery of Sanyo,And stopped charging, the charger is dangerousI recommend not to buy this product, waste of money, it is better to buy two of the four regular Chargers BatteriesIf in any case you decided to buy this product, do not use batteries over 2000MAHThat would certainly burn the device"
1,Cords are too short.,"This charger uses a power supply brick. The cord from the brick to the cahrger is 24"". The cord from the brick to AC is 36"". The brick is so heavy it pulls the charger off of my desk.I called the manufacturer about this. They say the cables use to be MUCH longer but somebody in China decided to shorten them.This is just plain stupid!!!"
5,Should have bought this sooner,"Always heard that Maha made excellent products.Now, I too am a believer. It basically takes old batteries and rejuvenates them.If your batteries are new, it will insure the longest life possible.Lots of helpful features and it does 8 batteries at a time. Great product."
1,"Ran hot, melted & destroyed batteries","Well I got this because I heard good things about it as well as I wanted the flexibility to charge 8 batteries at once.Unfortunately I got a defective one as after a couple of months it ran hot one day while charging 4 eneloope batteries and destroyed them. Luckily I never charge batteries while not being around, so I was able to avoid a fire.If you own one, keep any eye on it."
2,worked OK for a few weeks...,"I was fairly happy with this charger for a few weeks, although the user interface (and yes, it has one) is not intuitive - I had to read the manual to understand what its modes are and what the display is trying to say.Unfortunately, it died for no obvious reason after a few weeks. Called Maha tech support - they were helpful and sympathetic. Once we ran some diagnostics and they concluded it was really dead, they took my name & address and promised me a replacement unit.No replacement unit ever arrived - it's been > 1 month. Given that I can do other profitable things with my time, all I accomplished by calling them was to double the cost of a dead gadget.I think it is a decently-designed product, kudos for trying to innovate, cost-reduced to the point of being too delicate for its job, and backed by a flakey support system."
1,"second charger from Maha in 2 years, NO MORE.","This is my second charger in less than 2 years, Last one was purchased november 2011 and right now does't charge anymore and every time I try to charge a battery only see flashings on the lCD and start to get a smell.No more chargers form Maha, very poor construction"
1,Melted,"I've had two of these units for a few years now. Yesterday I found one of the units sizzling and popping and melting the covers off of the batteries it was charging, which were expressing foul fumes and noxious liquid. Not sure why these units don't have some kind of fail-safe on board. Thermometer technology is fairly well understood these days.f"
5,Best charger ever,This is one of my best buys. I am using this charger every day since over a year and all batteries love it. I call this a long term investment.
3,Mostly good,"Well, I found reviews about this product awhile back when looking to find an easy way to charge more than 76 batteries every two weeks (lots of programmable candles). I ordered 1 to test, then three more. At this point, many months later, I'm down to two. One just stopped working. Not sure why, but it wouldn't charge anymore. The other one melted this weekend. It was being used as usual and I came in to see if they were done and smelled something electrical. The side was melted and hot as hell. Not sure about the batteries. I looked on Amazon's reviews and found a few that said the same thing. Not a lot but a few. Now, should they overheat and melt when used according to instructions...um...NO. I'm just happy I was watching the progress so closely or it could have ended badly. Now, am I overworking them...perhaps...but one would hope for the price, they would be able to handle it. So I will be looking for an alternative replacement to get back up to four."
5,This is a hidden gem!,"I bought this after my eneloop battery charger told me that I needed 14 hours to charge the batteries. This is a smart charger, and it let's you know the charge of each battery individually, and won't fry your batteries like the 15-minute ones. You can even recondition old rechargeable batteries with it. Awesome. So worth the price!"
5,Easy to use soft charge feature,"One button to press between fast charge and soft charge. Soft charge being the better charge. Wish it was a switch instead of pressing every time but its not that hard. Also, the individual monitor and charge per battery puts this charger as one of the best out there."
2,bargain book,"as a photographer, had hoped for more coverage of light and composition. this is a book you will find on the clearance bin at any bookstore for 5.99."
5,A whole new perspective on art!,"I recieved this book as a gift, and since that time, I have become an avid art-lover. The painting selections are very tasteful, and the reproductions are fabulous! But the best part by far are the annotations. I never fail to be interested by them, no matter which painting I am looking at. This book keeps me engaged for hours, just reading the notes about the paintings. A supurb work."
3,Not as good as I expected,"I found this book interesting but too much information was given about the author and his own personal life. I thought this book was supposed to be about Miles Davis. Wrong. The author throws in his own biography while talking about Miles and Murphy'sis not interesting. Quite frankly, I could have done without hearing about this."

5,Priceless jewel!,"Tough to find (in the U.S.) even at its original release during the mid 70's, this gem, (along with the several other Alan Price albums of the same period), have been long overdue for CD issue.Cut for cut, ""Metropolitan Man"" is the most satisfying Price set, after the excellent (and much easier to find!) ""O Lucky Man"" movie soundtrack. Price shows a surprising amount of diversity on this collection, from the rousing power pop of ""Papers"", to the bouncing calypso of ""Mama Divine"" and the haunting balladry of ""Fool's Gold"" (which features a memorable organ intro reminiscent of Price's own classic keyboard stylings on the Animals' ""House of The Rising Sun""). Also not to be overlooked are Price's clever and sometimes droll way with a lyric. He is sorely missed by many music fans...kudos to Edsel Records for making his legacy available again!"
3,"Sorry to be negative, but...","I am kind of disappointed w/this sponge, and this is why - the sponge has only one side w/the scrubbing surface, which I know is just like all other scrubbing sponges, but the backside of this sponge seems to be useless for wiping up spills, etc. I wouldn't even really care about these two issues except that when the back of the sponge is wet and soapy, it is very slippery, making it very difficult to hold onto when you're trying to scrub something w/the scrubbing side. For me, this is just way too annoying and a deal breaker. The vender was great though - fast and free shipping. No complaints there. One more thing that personally I don't like is that the sponge feels tacky to the touch, kind of like a roughed up piece of synthetic plastic material. Like I said, sorry to be negative, but just my opinion..."
5,Simply an excellent sponge,"It may sound crazy, but these sponges are really fantastic, both the rectangular and circular ones. They scrub and clean great, never seem to gather any odors, and they last forever. It seems silly to spend the time to write a review of a kitchen sponge, but in today's world of cheap, crappy products I think that an outstanding product should get the praise it deserves, and these Magic Jetz Scrubs are excellent."
3,Cleans great but rips really fast.,I read reviews that this was a great item and it is. But it did not last long for me.
1,Overpriced,"I was searching for a sponge to scrub my pots and pans. I read the reviews and decided to try this sponge out. First, the sponge is very small. It does not scrub any better. I could get a pack of 3M scotch pads for less money and working just as well. I still don't understand the great reviews."
5,scrubber,This scrubber works great on the glass top stoves. You can add some glass top cleanser to get those hard to remove stains.
4,It's a review about a sponge...,"I don't review sponges, but after reading all the reviews and seeing it's way more than you'd expect from a sponge I had to try it out. It's not...it's just a sponge. It lasted a week longer than a normal sponge for me when looking for wear, but once it started to wear it was useless to me, and it is very hard to use for anything now that it is wearing (the wear is by the logo on the ""smoother"" side). I live in a house with no dishwasher (except myself) and we are a family of four, we go through sponges pretty quick. 4 stars because it gave me an extra week and it never started to smell! I wouldn't order another though, I'd rather just go through the other sponges at the price."
2,Lasted only 4 months,"I was hoping to be able to support this USA company for a long time, but I'm not going to spend this much money to replace a scrubber every 4 months when I can buy a 3 pack of scrubber/sponges locally for 99 cents. This Magic Jetz lasted only 4 months (very light use) and then it ripped open and shredded.The only thing this Magic Jetz did well was getting my Teflon pans gently clean. But any scrubber can do that. I didn't even use this scrubber on a daily basis as I have a dishwasher. The 3 pack of scrubbers for 99 cents does a 100% better job on crusty cooked on food on my stainless steel cookware."
2,it;s so so,"i expected better product, it's already falling apart it's been a month and it's was not used excessively."
1,Weak,"Only used it for average home dish scrubbing prep before the dishwasher. Started coming apart at the edges a couple months after purchase, but not completely. So much for the good reviews."
3,Falls apart in a few months,"As a few others have mentioned, this sponge does not last as long as I had hoped. My biggest problem is really just cleaning knives and forks. They seem to grab onto the sponge and pull it apart, to the point where I was pulling off pieces of the sponge from my dishes. I've tried two sponges at this point, knowing that the first sponge had been ruined by some sharp knives, but even with trying to be more careful with the second sponge I'm finding the same results."
4,"Descent sponge, works well, gets the job done.","I bought this because it was touted to be one of the better sponges out there and I was looking for something to easily take out the tough stains in my kitchen sink. This gets the job done BUT the reason I gave it four stars is because I was expecting it to be like the magic eraser and work wonders but it's not on that level. I like that it can be washed in the dishwasher, re-usable, does not scratch easily and is double sided. Overall it's a solid sponge but not the miracle worker I was hoping for."
3,Decent sponge but a little over priced,"I bought both the round and the rectangular with the intention of cleaning cookware. Although it did preform well, I feel that it wasn't any better than what you find in the grocery store."
3,affordable quality,"Neiko is a great cheap air die grinder. I got exactly what I paid for. A small automotive project day one was great. Day two the grinder literally fell apart in my hands. The head came lose right after i was forced to tighten just below the arbor. I'm glad I didn't pay more for this tool. Maybe I'll be able to get everything tightened back up and useable again. Maybe mine was just a fluke, but there is no pucker factor in a garage when the tool falls apart while grinding."
3,stripped gears,"Customer service was right on time. The tool itself only lasted a few months before the gears stripped out. This is typical for these angle grinders. In my line of work these tools are used for most of a 9 hour shift. They are not designed for this kind of heavy duty use. I just have to keep buying untill I find one that is more durable,which will likely cost a lot more to purchase."
1,Hardly Heavy Duty,Used the Neiko Angle Die Grinder on and off for a few weeks and the had trouble with the head loosening upcausing it to swivel out of alignment. Since I have a smallish 5.2 scfm at 90PSI compressor I could only operatethis tool for a minute or two which was what I expected. After 6 weeks of light use it totally fell apart. You get what you pay for!
4,Eragon the game,"This is a great game. If you like games with sword fighting and magic then this is for you. It can be challenging at times (the Urgals are a real pain to fight and they are very frustrating), but if you like a challenge then get it."
3,good and bad,"The first thing you notice when you start playing the game is the stone age graphics :). They are very cartoonish, and actually kind of make the story look dumb. The fighting sequences are cool, but they can get old, because there are same fighting moves throughout game. The best part about the game is the use of magic. You gain more ways to use it throughout the story. It isn't really like the book, so if you were expecting like the game to exactly follow the book, you shouldn't....I enjoy playing it, but I am definently not aching if I am not playing it."
1,Complete Disappointment,"The game was a complete disappointment. Story line does not hold true to the movie it is supposed to be about. A waste of money. Game can be completed in 12 hours or less. A game is supposed to get more difficult as the game progresses, the final level was the easiest level of all. The game was rushed through the production and shouldn't have been produced if the game designers weren't willing to create a product worth buying. Because of the violence, it isn't appropriate for young children, yet only a young child could enjoy playing this shoddily produced game."
2,Eragon relies entirely on unenthusiastic gameplay that's way too shallow to sustain interest for more than a few minutes.,"Both as an action adventure game, and a licensed work, Eragon comes across as substandard in just about every way imaginable. It feels like an unfinished game that was rushed through to release in time for the movie to appear in theaters. The combat is repetitive, the presentation is dull and lifeless, and the entire game suffers from an apparent lack of effort."
5,BEST GAME EVER,"This game is the best ever. It is so cool. It has a lot of action. It is a very hard game. The hardest part is when you fight the razac. A secret to the game is to collect all the secret eggs, and fight Durza's soldiers endlessly."
2,The Innovators,"The first and last chapter dragged as the author argued all around any points he was attempting to make. The middle of the book told a good story about technical advancement if you could get past the first chapter. The begining and end were disjointed, rambling, and seemed contrived to impress the reader with the author's mastery of the subject matter more than making any particular points."
5,The Road of Souls,Nick does a great job in this book telling about his canoe trip down the whole Mississippi with great flashbacks on the history of the people who lived on the river and some of the things they did during early contact with the Eroupeans. It appears that the author grew a lot from this trip and possibly changed his life in a good way. A must read for folks interested in what a man can do if he wants to really try to overcome obstacles and find inner peace
3,"good toy, but too delicate for boys","This is a great looking little toy and the figure itself is hardy; however, the lightsaber keeps breaking and I have had to superglue it already 3 times. My son feels like he can't really play with it for fear of breaking the lightsaber again. Also, the arms don't move and only has one stance. Other than that, it's ok to collect but not to really play with. Too bad, my son loved the looks of it, but too delicate."
2,THIS IS NO TOY,"This toy does not look like the character, Qui-Gon Jinn!! This toys has no poseability and his light saber baem broke off so did his arm!!!! And his legs can not move at all and somthing that looks stupid is that his armpits show as if he ripped his cloak........DO NOT BUY THIS THING oh and DO NOT BUY THIS THING!"
1,Don't waste your money on this cd,"I heard him down in Miami a few months ago and was really impressed. I read some online reviews saying this was his best cd, so I picked it up. I was sorely disappointed. The cd sounded like some of the really bad amateurish mixes from the late 90s, that try to impress with the use of only a few cool sounds. He mixed well, but the actual music was boring and flat. I'm going straight to a used cd store to try to trade in for a better cd."
4,Psychic TV - 'Live In Three Mean Fiddler' (Temple Records),"Sound quality of this limited edition - 1,000 copy archive CD is better than I had expected - probably because awhile back, I heard a friend's copy of a similar release from the live bunch of Psychic TV releases they'd put out and THAT show sucked, if I remember correctly. However, 'Live In Three Mean Fiddler' serves as a good live documented performance from Psychic TV in their prime. Tunes here that gives you that 'like-you-are-there' vibe are ""Mu-Sick Non Stop!"", ""Your Body"", the effectively-weird ""SticK Insecticide"" and the eight-minute ""I Can Hear Thee Voice Of Unclean Spirit"". Personnel: Genesis P-Orridge - guitar, noise & vocals, Fred Giannelli - lead guitar, Daniel Black - keyboards and Mathew Best - drums. Definitely recommended."
3,Sabbat Information,This book is very helpful in learning about the Sabbats and different rituals that can be performed.
3,"This is a HOME RECORDING, it is AMERICANA to a T","With every new artist coming out today with there crystal clean sounds and studio tricks, many people long for ""their old stuff"". Their old stuff was made when they didn't have quite the same sheen and radio friendliness as they have now, but much more emotion and rawness. Jim Croce's old stuff is what it says it is. OLD STUFF. Old as in scratchy covers recorded on an old recorder in an old home in Pennsylvania, before Jim was an established radio friendly studio artist. You're not going to here Bad Bad Leroy Brown, or Time in A Bottle, but you will hear and feel the heart of a man who recorded such songs in a time before he was produced, remastered, and thrown to the public. Many may say this stuff never should have left the house, and that someone should have remastered, or cleaned it up, but I think if that were the case, it would have lost it's appeal. Although it isn't really new Jim Croce, it is new to us."
2,Only for the Croce fanatic,"Most of the songs are only 1:30 to 2:00 long and the quality, as stated in other reviews, is not too good. I thought it could have been remastered better. I'll listen to this now and then but it will most likely sit on my shelf and collect dust. I'm a HUGE Jim Croce fan but I have to give this a thumbs down. 15 songs totaling 31 minutes isn't worth releasing. Should have had them available for download instead."
2,Demos are Usually Left Unreleased for a Reason,"Fanatics of Jim Croce - you've hopefully already bought this, any new material warrants immediate attention. However, if you are a new or casual fan you'll do best to steer clear. Jim sings a collection of traditional roots americana songs giving the hardcore fan a glimpse of developing skill and talent, but for the non-Croce obsessive the sound is poor (home recordings - as the title implies) and the set lacks the confidence and quality that his recordings 4 years later are now famous for."
2,They do NOT sell replacement glass shades!,"It has been infuriating trying to find a replacement glass shade. They are not sold anywhere. ProTrack is not a stand-alone company that you can contact either...you can't find any information on the company, you can only find their products. Not helpful when no one sells replacement shades. Apparently you have to buy a completely new light fixture if you happen to break one of the glass shades. I wish we had a Tech Lighting fixture instead. At least they sell replacement shades."
4,"Excellent comp, however...","The upside is that these are the ORIGINAL versions of Webb's hits, not the awful remakes he made later. However, there's one thing you should know: the version of ""Slowly"" included here is NOT the hit version, but rather an earlier one. While it's nice to have this alternate take (as it isn't available anywhere else other than the Bear Family box, I'm sure), it seems odd that the more familiar version of ""Slowly"" wasn't used. I say this because of its historical significance -- Bud Issacs' pedal steel intro was really the genesis of pedal steel in country music; it was hugely influential, and it seems odd to hear ""Slowly"" without it. This quibble aside, the whole CD is worth it for the chance to hear ""The New Raunchy."" One wonders what them boys was drinkin' in the studio that night!"
2,salted cod fish,I was expecting fillets but there were lots of very tiny pieces of fish. Very hard to fry and did not taste good.
5,Great value,"I bought three of these copper plated tankards; aka ""mugs"", last year to use for my visit to the local Renaissance Faire.These are the most economical copper plated tankards I have found on the web."
1,Avoid this one!,"This violinist had seen better days... Some of her previous albums were worth listening. She fooled me to believe she is serious about good music, and about Bach. This album, however, is a rude awakening. Really corny, new age fluff, with simple violin melodies any bad violinist could play. I guess she sold her soul for good cash..."
1,Cheap?,"I bought this cd new, sealed, on ebay, for $2.26! I thought it was a great deal. Until I heard it. It's so bad! It's just so tacky!!! It sounds so much like cheap, fake, plastic music. This musician must know it's total crap... I mean, she is considered to be quite a talented serious violinist. She certainly could fool me with this one. This has to be one of the worst cds I have ever owned. Save your time and money for artists like Yo-yo Ma, Joshua Bell, Boris Belkin and others who have minimal standards they don't go below. (Not even for money.)"
2,Too much over the top,"When I heard the first tunes of the CD, I thought there must have been a mistake and they put the wrong CD in the wrong cover... Then I checked: Yes, I its still reads ""Bach"" on the CD itself... It was anwakening, if not necessarily rude as a fellow reviewer has sugessted, but certainly a very suprising one.Well, even if you like crossovers, this one is way over the top. I would not have recognized a single track as being from JSB. Look at other, more laudable crossover-experiments. Maybe the Kronos-quarttet, or recently Pierre Laurant Aimard in his Ligeti-Pygmae music approach. Risk taking, and interesting.This one here is just lush entertainment, a far too easy listening. No risk taking at all. It's interesting, yes sad, what otherwise serious classical music artists will do for money nowadays..."
1,Lost it.,"Selling classical music with sex has never been something I cared for. And St. John always had very questionable CD covers. Nevertheless, I always had to admit that when it came to the music itself, it sounded like she had real integrity. The playing was always first class, with lots of personality and quite unique. Now, she just shattered all this. This CD has no integrity and no music, lowering herself to the level of corny artists like Linda Brava or what have you. Would she soon be posing for Playboy as well? ... Thank god there are still violinists like Hilary Hahn and Sarah Chang around to save the classical grace."
1,"A GIRL GONE WILD, AND DOWNWARD...","This album is about a girl gone wild and certainly the reflection of a career gone wrong. If it were something irresponsible done to this girl then it could be said that it was tragic. But rather, in this case it appears the artist was very much a part of the process of the album and not a victim at all. This kind of a pathetic path downward is quite rare, even nowdays. Without a doubt, a product of a musician brought up without wholesome, solid musical values and traditions."
1,Not a serious musician.....,"I stumbled across St John's website, and read the big letter title: ""The Curse of Beauty for Serious Musicians"". This is apparently how her agents would like the general public to look upon her musical career. Some beauty I can see, but a serious musician? Never. This ""re: Bach"" album could not have been made by anyone who is a serious or even just an honest musician. It is an album that tries to lure the listeners with superficial effects like funky percussion, sexy female whispers, slick bass guitar and other elements that have no place together with anything that has Bach's name written on it. It is obvious that the artist thinks nobody out there can tell the difference between a good, honest musical expression and third rate commercial junk. It is also quite apparent that the artist has little respect for her audience's intelligence. (Maybe she knows something I don't.) But she did not fool me. This has to be one of the worst albums of all time."
1,Poor Lara!,"Poor Lara! For years, she tried everything to get noticed. First it was the nude cover of her first album, then the tough girl image of the second, afterwards the sexy ""bad girl"" cover of the third. Still, some people thought she was also a worthwhile violinist and some even liked her fresh attitude.In this last cd, however, she exposes not her body, for a change, but her lack of musical integrity or depth. It's no wonder this cd is already widely considered a big flop. There's little good to say about it.Although some ignorant, or self-proclaimed ""progressive thinkers"" get lured by it's silly effects, I highly advise to skip this one. Ever since 'Switch on Bach' was made, over 30 years ago, countless albums with variations on the subject of Bach were produced. We've already heard it all. There's nothing new here.There are so many better albums out there that will ""expand your horizons"" without insulting your intelligence or your sound musical taste."
1,non intimate new age music with a big ego,"With all the wonderful cross over that exists around today, this album seems a total waste of time and money. The cover says ""please buy me 'cause I'm sexy"". But the cover is the best thing about this album. Musically, it is flat as a surfing board. Some melodies are more familiar than other ones, but what does it matter, anyway? They could have used Telemann or Chopin or Debussy, it would not make a slight little difference. the violin sound is really irritating at some sections. If I had to define the style of the music, I'd call it a non intimate new age. Not good enough to listen to and not pleasent or relaxing enough to hear in the background during dinner. Clearly, the artists' egos was bigger than their understanding of how to connect with their listeners."
1,cheap can become offensive,"At a certain point, 'cheap' becomes offensive. This album offends because of it cheapens the greatness of Bach. I'm not talking about a snobby reaction to something that tries to popularize classical music. The pop versions here are so transparently dull and without soul that I feel it is necessary to post a reaction. This album is soulless. But aside from that: I just read an interview with this violinist where she complains she is not taken seriously enough, because of her good looks and her provocative record covers. I find this complaint totally absurd in light of such tasteless, soulless cheap album. A real serious musician would have never made this album."
3,"Lighten up people, please","I'm a Bach fan. I like my Bach played straight up in the traditional manner. I also love Bach turned upside down, hair let out, green spandex tights, guitar solos, acapella scat singing, goldbergs transcribed for string trio, toccata and fugue on a steel drum, etc..Here we have Lara St. John giving us a not bad at all rendition of what would be required to make Bach work at a club or a rave. A lot of Bach's music was based on dances but I'm guessing most of the reviewers don't dance. Since only an SCA freak still dances minuets, maybe this is as close as most of us will get to hearing Bach's music with dance in mind.Sure some of the tracks are a little cheesy but some of them work well enough. Relax, enjoy yourself, there is no it."
1,Worse than anything I've heard in years...,"Sony should not have made this album... But then, a big company can afford to make mistakes from time to time. This album, however, is just about Lara and her musical choices. It is not about music, certainly not Bach's. I also doubt Lara really wanted to promote ""Muzak"" or pop beats of any kind. She night have wanted to show herself as a a ""forward thinking"" young lady, who ""moves with the times"". A person who is willing to step on the most ""holly"" musical icons for no clear reason or logic. This album could never helped her sagging career, anyway. I bought it for $2.39 and now I see it's available for as little as 0.89. It is not often that one makes such an obvious mistake in choosing what to record. This artist was recognized by some to be fairly serious about her craft. Many others thought differently. But this pathetic album is the clearest proof that behind the pretty face was nothing of substance, ever."
5,Very Good,"Now there may be those of you who are knew to the world of Warcaft. This plot was a cornerstone of the oldest Warcraft of them all, Warcaft One. I think it an excellent book rendition of those events and it also ansewers many questions that I thought would never be ansewered. If you liked the last two, go ahead and buy this book."
4,"Great story, just a bit rushed","I recently read this one and I must say, while the story is good it felt so incredibly rushed. You get a good idea of the main character Khadgar early on, but only learn a little bit of Medivh. A lot of time is spent on Khadgar's first few days as Medivh's ""assistant"" but then it quickly moves to what I assume to be a month or so ahead, and the rest is just as quick. Another main character, Garona, is introduced and unlike the initial relationship between Khadgar and Medivh, you don't learn much about Garona's relationship with either other than they trust each other. The story itself is good, don't get me wrong but I feel so much more could've been explored and explained in this book that seemed to be glossed over."
3,Good read for what it is,"This book was pretty good, for what it is - if you are expecting high blown literature you won't get it here....but you won't get it from any WOW book, or from most Sci-Fi, for that matter. It was an entertaining story, and it was interesting to understand the background to the Karazhan raid. It certainly portrayed Medivh in a different light, and gave me a much greater understanding than I had from in-game. It was not as good as some of the other WOW books (although I am just getting started), but definitely worth the quick read (it is very short). Khadgar and Medivh were well developed, although some of the other characters could have used a bit more character development (I would have liked some more background on Garona, for example, especially given her pivotal role later in the series). All in all a good background story, and worth reading."
3,Decent,"This book would've been much better if it had been revised after WoW came out. There are a lot of little details that changed when when WoW was released. It was worth reading just to get the back story, but I was annoyed that this book wasn't updated, especially since I bought the Kindle version. If you're a longtime WoW player, prepare to be annoyed by things that dont match up. If you haven't played WoW, and you're reading this book for some odd reason, you'll probably enjoy it."
5,Wonderful Read,"I read this story thinking it would be a nice prelude to WoW's first expansion. Little did I realize how blown away I'd be.The author gives such personality not only to the characters, but the environments and settings as well. Karazhan is depicted in such detail that I found the in game version lacking to the story's. The lore characters present are compelling and given personalities that match with the older games which they are present in. And most of all, the story made me fall in love with the complexity and internal turmoil that Medivh faces daily. This is a must read for any Warcraft fans and those looking to get into the lore."
5,Good Book,"Good book, received it quickly and it was in great condition. I've read most of the Warcraft books, this one was definitely my favorite. Great story, great writing, perfect for a Warcraft fan."
2,will never buy one of his books again,"i have bought 5 of Jeffs books and all of them are substandard. like with Stephan king i do not see how this guy has followers. but enough bashing him. so far as the book goes it self, i was very disappointed with its take of ""the last guardian"". but it did provide some new insight in to war craft lore which is nice."
4,The way they should've started,"An excellent addition to the WarCraft series of books. In fact this is where I wanted to see the books start when I picked up the first one and read it. There is so much rich history in the WarCraft games I don't understand why they wanted to start them off at beginning of the WarCraft 3 storyline.Anyway, this was a well written book and really expands up on the WarCraft history. The characters are addictive and the story pushes you on from page to page. About 4 days to read this book if that.I give this book 4 out of 5 stars. Very well written."
5,Another face of Pergolesi,"Pergolesi was famous by his comic opera in classic music history, and succeed this music trend to spread more popular, especial later had a big influence of opera development, argued the styles of Italy or France.From this CD, we could find Pergolesi had a colorful instrumental composition, and serve as a pioneer of transaction from late baroque to classic period.I am a fans of pergolesi, sometimes when I listenned his music, I thought if he lived longer, that would been great for music lovers."
1,must have interest in the subject matter,This book was a gift. There are a few very nice pictures but I think to really enjoy it you need to have an interest in the subject of Indians. If not it just seems to go on and on. As a gift or for yourself I would not buy it unless you or your friend has a real interest in the subject matter.
1,interest in subject ?,"After looking at the book and reading the reviews I agree most with the reader who said you must have interest in the subject matter. In the last review the reader rated the book as very good but in his own words he had stayed on a reservation and had a great interest in and a super knowledge of the subject. I can see how someone with interest would enjoy it but for me,as someone without the above after 30 or so pages this book became a chore to get through."
1,boring and dreary,In this book the were a few nice pictures but I found most of them dark and dreary and depressing.All in all it was boring.
2,"If you have your Windows 98 manual, you won't need this book","I bought the quick reference looking for short-cuts or tips, and there aren't any in this book. There isn't anything in ""Windows 98 For Dummies Quick Reference"" that isn't already in your Windows 98 manual. Save your money, or better yet, buy a magazine subscription to a PC magazine instead."
2,"global spirit,Karunesh",Not the music I liked before from Karunesh.Just to much chanting for. The music it self was good.
2,Karunesh disappoints in global spirit(GS)!,"I read a lot of great reviews on karunesh and bought this so-called ""platinum best seller"" but it really SUCKS!! I'd great opinion on this osho disciple and his fusion music, however this album is in a totally different and dull league compared to his gems-zen breakfast and nirvana cafe!GS is too oriental, synthetic and clearly lacks harmony. Only solitude and earth song does well and the other ones are very indian with incoherent african beats.Overall it's only slightly better than a dumb Bollywood/Hindi movie!!!"
3,Genie (Import),"Up until 2007, I had never even heard of the ""Brooklyn, Bronx and Queens"" Band. Well, I had heard several of their songs over the years, but never knew the band/group that performed them, well, that's my loss!This album, 'Genie' is a good effort from the band. My favorite, of course is the Title Track, 'Genie.' I can listen to this song (which captures 80's (slightly) up tempo, ballads), over and over again. To me, Genie rates a 'five-star' rating, but the rest of the tracks fall a little short. Not bad, but not great either (but that's just my opinion - you may think differently!).I rate this album, three stars!"
5,Finally!,I accidentally found them on Youtube. I remember this group while growing up and remember listening to these jams. I had to purchase them.
1,Riddled with typos,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. However, the sheer volume of typos and other writing errors really distracted from the narrative. Also, as another reviewer pointed out, the imagined dialogue throughout the book feels second-rate at best."
2,Not Very Good,"This is apparently a re-telling of a lot of other stories about the ""Bell Witch."" I've heard the author state on the air, for instance, that he doesn't believe the part of the story about Andrew Jackson occurred, but he uses it in his book; go figure. Didn't learn anything at all about the original story I didn't already know, but there are some of the writer's own theories in the second half. Bought it second-hand and, overall, feel like I paid too much"
1,Not worth yor time,"This book was not a good one. I even gave it to someone else and they had the exact same opinion. If you want a good Bell Witch book, pass this one by."
2,Maybe I shouldn't be reviewing this...,"...because I just don't get it. This is so boring I can't even begin to listen to the whole thing. Maybe after smoking opium or something some of these soft, slow, endless passages would be stimulating, but still an unlikely notion."
5,Excelent translator,This translator is an excelent one. Lost of words and inteligent way to find for words.
1,bad LCD after 2 years,LCD broke after 2 years of minimal use. ECTACO would not fix it. When I look at competitors models I see that they have similar features for MUCH less money and usually include verb conjugations. This does not. I really do not know why ECTACO is sooo much more expensive than other brands. I will take my chance with a $29 Franklin or other brand before buying any ECTACO again.
1,Don't buy this one,"Not the quality I expected. Touchy keypad repeated letters frequently. Many words I tried to look up just were not there. And worst of all, now that the warranty is expired, after having it less than two years, it no longer works in battery mode. I will have to buy a new one to take to Mexico, but not this brand."
1,Sony Playstation 2 Remote,I purchased this remote control to make watching DVD's on the PS2 easier. I had problems getting it to work consistantly right out of the box. I had to press most of the buttons very hard to get them to work. I hoped it would get better but it only got worse. I am now back to using the game controler and threw the remote control away.I would NEVER recommend this product.
4,The Miracle No One Believed,"It Happened Tomorrow is like the pre-decessor for the TV show Early Edition. It is about a newspaperman (Dick Powell) who tells an old man in the records department that he'd give ten years of his life to see tomorrow's newspaper. In fact, he does, for three days, and what he sees isn't necessarily great news. There are plenty of twists and turns in this film, telling us and Powell that what appears to be the case might not always be the truth.Powell is wonderful in this movie (with a moustache!). Not only is he great in the leading man spot, he's very funny too. He is the perfect blend of the guy next door and the hero-type, making him easy to relate to and interesting enough to want to watch.Costarring Linda Darnell as Powell's love interest and Jack Oakie as her protective uncle, this is a fun example of a lesser known gem of Hollywood."
4,Who would have known?,"The reviews below do a fine job giving you an idea of the movie itself. I initially picked it up as I am a big fan of the TV show Early Edition. The movie does not disappoint with it's great writing, acting, and now infamous plot. Regardless of the show, the movie stands well on it's own.What I wanted to make sure intrerested consumers were aware of was the DVD itself. The quality of the print is fantastic with very few artifacts. The audio is excellent with no noticeable drop outs or clipping. Sadly, there are no extras. I only gave 4 stars for this reason..."
2,It's no good to know the future,"A silly story of a newspaperman (Dick Powell) who is miraculously given tomorrow's newspaper for a few consecutive days and, ultimately, has to prove that the report of his death is greatly exaggerated. IT HAPPENED TOMORROW is a comedy that isn't all that funny and a work of speculation that isn't all that compelling. Powell proves that he can't grow a moustache and looks bad in circa 1905 clothing. Fans of Jack Oakie can expect a couple of chuckles, Linda Darnell is beautiful. Would have given it another star if Powell had broken out into song, any song."
2,A stinker,"One wonders why UCLA spent time and money to refurbish this clunker. Young Linda Darnell, however gorgeous, can barely act. Jack Oakie plays...well, Jack Oakie. Edgar Buchanan is wasted as a cop. Dick Powell, now shedding his dumb tenor roles in those Busby Berkeley films, is competent and does his best to make this unfunny movie at least palatable.If you're into amateur theatre, you might like this. Otherwise, save your money."
4,A fine selection,Andrew has made a fine selection here. He gives proper weight to Wilfred Owen who is by far the best first world war poet and the best war poet of all time. Ivor Gurney is also given his due. I would rate Ivor as the second best war poet or at least equal to Sigfried Sassoon.
1,Shoddy product - Massive defect rate,"If there is a good review for this product, it is either:a.) A shill from Interact employees.b.) 1 of 10 people who actually managed to get one of these that worked.c.) Someone who has used the card for 15 minutes and has not encountered one of the many problems.Don't buy it. I returned mine from circuit city after it erased my Madden 03 season. If it is too good to be true, it probably is. Interact has permanently stained it's reputation with this piece of garbage."
1,Two Words...................No Good!!!,"I got this card and it erased my entire football team which took hours to create and my Bond game which took me a week to beat. When I returned it to Toys'R'Us the Video Games sales clerk nerd told me that 99% of the people that bought this memory card from their store returned it with numerous complaints. What else is there to say? If you buy it, it might work but if it doesn't! Everything is gone. One friend of mine even got one of his games broken from this memory card! PLEASE DO NOT MAKE the same mistake I made and get this Memory Card! Interact is a SHAME!"
1,Not STABLE!!,"I two lost game saves on this card. Uniquely enough it was only my Pikmin game that was causing problems. My other game saves still worked. But I didn't keep it around long to figure if the other game saves would get corrupt.I sold ...[it]back to Electronics Boutique and bought the Nintendo Puny 59 memory card, which has not ever failed. Now that Nintendo has a larger memory card, do yourself a favor and buy the Nintendo card."
1,corrupt data,"I didn't believe that this card could really be as bad as everyone said on here, but boy was I wrong, it will let me save a file maybe 1 or 2 times, but if i go to overwrite it it would say corrupt data, and force me to format all my saves..luckily i kept backups on my nintendo brand memory card 59 though. i no longer trust interact."
1,From a 5 Star to a 1 Star,This product is no longer worth buying. I bought it exclusively because Madden 2002 takes up a full memory card so I figured I would wait for this 16x and be all set. The problem is the season I saved (after just the first time) was corrupt the next time I tried to load it. I was upset but I thought it was a one time thing. After saving a new season and having the same thing happen the next time I tried to load it 100% DO NOT recommend this product.Why buy a memory card that doesn't save? It's like buying a car that doesn't drive.
2,Loved it....until 15 minutes ago,"To make things clear, I bought this almost a year ago, inserted it into my gamecube and have NOT removed it since. I love it, it held everything without worries. Now that I'm playing Madden 2003 I have been saving my franchise which has taken some time to build and kept it on this card...until tonight. I just loaded up Madden and this is what I get: The Madden 2003 file on Memory Card in Slot A is corrupted and must be deleted. Great, thanks. There are two other franchises on the card and both load fine. It's only the one that matters that is the problem. Makes me feel much better. My total happiness has been replaced by sheer disappointment. Consider this (and ANY other advice) when thinking about what to buy."
1,Fasle sense of security - read on...,"This is my first review of well anything but a sorry tale it is. I have had a cube for four years and this card for 18 months. It has been out of the machine perhaps twice. A couple of weeks ago I got the 'data corrupt, format card' note - damn. That's perhaps 100 game datas gone. Mario Sunshine, Wind Waker, Majora's Mask, Eternal Darkness, Resident Evil 4 and MANY others - you get the gist, adventure games with hundreds, perhaps thousands (yes I mean it) of hours of gameplay gone. Am I likely to want to try again, can I ever play them in the same way? Sure great card, fantastic save capability, until it all goes pop. Not funny. Not funny at all. I now have an imported official 1019 block Nintendo card (www.lik-sang.com), I wish i'd read this sooner."
2,do not buy this,"Do not buy this! I didn't listen to all the other reviews that said it corrupts. I ended up losing my Super Smash Brother""s Melee,tony hawk 3,cel damage, and a bunch of other game data. Buy the memory card 251 from nintendo which still has a lot of blocks."
1,Complete Garbage Do not buy,"...This card has given me nothing but problems. I have used it with many different games and it always corrupts the data immedietly after saving. Madden, wrestlemania, smash bros, blitz, rouge leader, all have the same result.It has never worked properly from the moment i ordered it through amazon when it first came out. I have no problem with the company Interact. I have had other products made by them that work fine. There are just compatiblity issues with this card and the gamecube.I have had no problems with the nintendo brand card which was about the same price.Do not buy it it will just be a headache."
2,Do not buy!,Do not buy the mega memory 16x. My neighbors got one thinking it would save a lot of space. It did hold a lot. It can hold up to 944 blocks of memory. Well anyway we were playing Super Smash Bros. Melee when all of a sudden the memory card corrupted! I had heard stories of that happening and it did. I have a memory card 251 which is smaller but won't corrupt. When their card coruppted they lost all their secret charecters and trophies.That stinks. Buy a 251!
1,What! The file is CORRUPT!,I am extremely dissappointed with the quality of this memory card. It erased all of my files unexpectedly. How could InterAct approve of such a lousy piece of junk!
1,It's too light for a paper weight,"I purchased this card fo my son, twice. The first one didn't work from day one so I returned it. The second one appeared to work for a short time, (just past the 30 day warranty period) then it worked intermittently then it stopped working completely...""NEVER AGAIN""..."
1,Used to work great,"I used to think this card was great, until it corrupted every data file I had. Fortunately I had my old memory cards, and was able to retrieve some of it. But that didn't help too much, I was missing anything I had done in the past 3 months. So I emailed the company, they claim its merely a defective product, and I try again. But alas, my files become corrupt again. Unless you are desperate for something now, there is no excuse to buy this product. Sure it can hold a lot of files, but they are useless when you never know when they will be lost. You need to purchase other cards just to back things up to, and since those are reliable, why bother? What a waste! I will never buy InterAct again!"
1,Stay Away,"Just bought NCAA 2003 and the InterAct memory card. Played eight games, saved my dynasty and went to bed. Next day, my files were corrupt.I then tried to re-save other dynasties and all of them were corrupt.I'm bummed, I'd love to have the 1000 blocks but if it's not reliable, it ain't worth it.Don't buy this card, unfortunately. You can't trust it."
4,"GC Extreme was right, munedog9 was way off!","All I really have to say is that this memory card is the best you can get. Right now I have had it for over seven months and not a thing has corrupted. And people, don't bash this card just because you bought a Memory Card 59 and it is full. I assume that you are jealous of the people who bought this card. And after all it's your decision...but trust me, this memory card is the best made to date. Don't believe people like munedog9 who bash this Product. And please...this is not a one star item..."
1,Very Unhappy,"I bought this card to save my Franchise mode in ASB 2003.After spending almost an hour to get my team set up and create a player, I got 4 games into the season and it said I had corrupt files. The only thing it would let you do is to delete the entire file. One other time when I tried to load a file,a message would come up saying ""no memory card found"" when in fact it was in the memory slot. After losing all my data,I'm afraid to start another season with this card and I'm currently looking into getting a different company's memory card.Don't waste your money or time with this card!"
3,Don't be fooled,"This memory card sounds to good to be true and it is. I saved many of my games on this card but after a few weeks of playing it said that the memiry had become currupt. I could not use the data and lost imformation for some games. If you play your Gamecube a lot, like me, you do not want to risk losing your data with this memory card. Nintendo's memory cards work the best and they and making new ones with more space."
4,Get a another memory card,"This memory cards messed up real bad. I got it for Christmas and I had to ""format"" (erase everything) Three times by March. so if you get this memory card propare to beat comes over and over and over again."
1,I lost my season!,"I bought this exclusively to use on NCAA Football 2003 to save my Dynasty. After a couple seasons using a regular college, it got corrupt and I lost everything. I tried again with a new college and it was corrupt after 3 games. Now it will only go a couple of games before it gets corrupt again and I have to trash everything. It was the greatest for the couple weeks while it worked because it holds everything, but it is terrible when all of your hard work (ha!) goes down the tubs because of a bad product."
1,UNSTABLE!,"Card seemed to work great for days at a time. However data would become corrupt and we would be prompted to delete the file every few days. Initially when my 10 year old lost his data on Sonic Adventure 2 Battle I convinced him it would be fun to ""do it all again."" The second time I agree that this is not what we paid for. Very unstable and has been returned. Not typical of the quality I am used to purchasing at Amazon."
1,Memory Loss!,"Don't buy this ... If you're just trying to use it for a few days to beat a game it is fine, but after using it for more than a week it begins to lose your files. You'll go to load up your game and it will just say ""File Corrupted, do you wish to delete it?"" Just wait for Nintendo's Memory Card 259 or whatever it's called to come out."
1,Quality Over Quantity,"Many people felt that this memory card was too good to be true because of the massive amount of memory it could store. Well, this card really IS too good to be true. While, in theory, it is capable of storing a large amount of memory, the card is unreliable and even though it can store a lot, it is really not worth the risk of losing all of your game data. Do not trust InterAct. Every product I've purchased from them (memory cards, controllers, etc.) have ultimately been defective or shoddy. Because of the initial reviews on IGN I thought that perhaps this memory card actually functioned properly, but unfortunately that was not the case."
1,Waste of Money,"I bought this memory card a week ago thinking that I could save seasons and profiles on Madden 2003 and NCAA 2003 but I was mistaken. I have had nothing but problems with this piece of garbage. If I could I would give it negative stars for this complete waste of money. The 16x will save fine with appartentley no problems, but when its time to retrieve data off the 16x it displays corrupt files or doesn't verify that a memory card is even present. At first I thought that I got a faulty 16x, BUT my 219 memory and my several 59 memory cards all save the same information just fine. My advice is save [the money] and buy the 219 memory card"
1,Simply Doesn't Work,"Does InterAct have any quality control standards whatsoever? Have they any scruples??This thing is purely, absolutely, 100% non-functional. I attempted a single Game Save from All-Star Baseball 2003, and it immediately corrupted my data. All subsequent attempts have met with similar failure. I will be returning my memory card. What a piece of junk."
2,To be or not to be,"The question is do you feel lucky. When buying this card you will either get a perfect one or piece of [crud]. My first one was corrupt and needed to be formated (which erases everything) every time i would save something. Then i returned it and got a new one which worked for a month until it had to be formatted one day for no reason. If you feel lucky you should by it, but if you don't you should wait for the Nintendo 251 memory card which is going to work perfectly 99.9999% of the time. You just cant trust cards not made buy nintendo."
1,ITS JUNK,"just wanted to add that all these people are right. I have had 3 of these cards replaced by circuit city (who are really living up to their easy return policy) and all of them were junk. They dump data regularly. Its a memory card, if it doesn't save data its JUNK."
1,"Lots of white space, not many ideas...","I purchased this book with about 6 others to investigate new ways to recognize employees. This book is only 106 small pages long, but even at that length, the author and publisher padded almost every page with big fonts, ... clip art, and LOTS of white space. I could look past this if only the few remaining ideas were valuable, but the book is full of ideas like ""Give your employee... (a candy bar) to recognize them for a good idea"" or ""Make everyone a big mug of hot chocolate""..."
4,Not as weird as you might think.,"Arthur Brown seems to be more normal than he wants you to think he is. Compared to Ween's ""The Pod"" or Zappa's ""Lumpy Gravy"", this guy's record seems almost mellow. It's still appealing, though: His versions of ""I've Got Money"" and ""I put a Spell on You"" are legit--that is, if you like lots of yelling and screaming."
3,"January 1, 2010? might as well be Jan 1, 90125!","2010??This isn't even released for 5 years? What's the point in listing it now?Holy heck, it's a terrific concert, so why does it take so long to put out something that a lot of us are clammoring for?What a terrible disservice to long time Yes fans."
2,There are better YES concerts.,"The only thing interesting about this video now is that it gives you the opportunity to see something directed by Steven Soderbergh before his first film, SEX, LIES & VIDEOTAPE.The creative cuts and edits are traditionally NOT what you want in a concert video. It tries so hard to be a real movie, that you don't get the feeling of the concert experience, like really being there.Then there is the set list. While they're good songs, there is no variety. Only two YES albums are covered here, ""The Yes Album"" and ""90125"". You don't get to hear any other classics like ""And You And I"" or ""Roundabout"", which I'm sure the band must have performed during their 1984 tour.For a better YES tour, check out the ""Keys To Ascention"" or ""Live From the House of Yes"" DVDs."
3,Mistake,"I'm pretty sure the 2010 designation is a mistake. CD Universe lists it as April 1 2006. It's slipped a few times, but I bet we will see this during Hillary's first term."
3,"Great Video, Audio is Painful in 2.0","I still have this on VHS and the audio is much better on VHS. I'm not a fan of watching DVD concerts in 5.1 since concerts are not 5.1 when you're there live. They could've done better on the audio.Aside from that, I am still happy they finally released this on DVD as my VHS is getn thin.I sill like the Trvor Rabin era of yes better as it is so much more progressive."
3,Good Gig No Stereo Track,"I have the VHS of this show,the stereo track is superb,but the DVD 2.0 audiotrack is MONO!! BAHH,you can use the 5,1 thru normal stereo system (ie not using the optical input) to get a similar effect though.Nice show pity about the audio."
2,Tepid,"Perfectly acceptable at the price, but not the classic Mantovani collections many will remember from the 1950s and '60s. Caveat emptor."
3,Hillbilly Meth Music,Kid Rock-ish with a generous dose of love for methamphetamine and Dirty South Rap music.Good stuff to play in your Pontiac Trans-Am or IROC-Z.
3,The Usual Confusion,"I bought a new desktop, already programmed for Windows Vista and Word 2007, so I needed help. The book answers some obvious questions, but also assumes excellent prior knowledge of XP."
5,Black White Polka Dot Scarf,"I love it, goes great around your neck if you are in your 60's to 70's covers up the neck if wrapped properly."
5,Exceptionally clear and easy to understand guide to Sanskrit,"Sacred Sanskrit Words is the perfect book for yoga teachers like myself who want to learn the meaning of the most often used Sanskrit words. The writing is exceptionally clear and easy to understand, and encourages and inspires the reader to go forward and learn more! As I read this book I began to understand that through Sanskrit we have the opportunity to come into the realm of a sacred language that is timeless and eternal. I highly recommend this thoughtful and illuminating book to all students of yoga as well as philosophers, theologians, scientists, health practitioners, musicians, historians and anyone else interested in exploring the cosmos and workings of the mind and soul.Suza Francina, Author, The New Yoga For People Over 50 and Yoga and the Wisdom of Menopause."
5,very informative,"this is a very well crafted book. it is 200 plus pages length. it contains many of the basic sanskrit words, written in both sanskrit and english translations. this is an outstanding general text for especially those with an interest in yoga or spiritual traditions. this is not a scholarly text. for the price, i found it a delightful read and useful as a book for periodic review."
1,It didn't play at all.,They died with their boots on. ..died at the start...fisrt the in troduction would come on....and then it would just stop...not play at all...is this enough words...Now that I can rate this product?
3,"Entertaining Movie, Poor Colorization","My husband, sons and myself enjoyed this movie, although I'm a bit embarrassed to say that I found myself saying ""Wow--I didn't know it happened that way!"" (it didn't). My only complaint is that, whereas I usually enjoy colorized movies, I found the colorization of this movie to be a bit distracting. Colors often bled into areas where they didn't belong. In one main character the face was skin colored, but the facial scruffiness was in black and white (although not completely consistently). I understand why this version of the movie has not been made into a DVD. The colorization quality is too poor."
5,this movie is a timeless masterpiece,"Although this movie plays fast and loose with some historical facts, many similarities exist between Flynn's portrayal with the actual life of GAC. One reviewer wrote that Custer finished last in horsemanship. The fact is that Custer was an excellent horseman and was acknowldged as such at West Point. Civil War scenes accurately depict Custer charging with his men. Oliva is terrific as ""Libby""."
5,They Died with Their Boots On,"Great movie, one of the all time Errol Flynn/Olivia de Havilland classicss. Not accurate hitorically, but a classic nevertheless. Worth watching over & over again..."
4,The Last of Errol Flynn and Olivia deHavilland,"They Died With Their Boots On features one of Errol Flynn's greatest performances as the flamboyant General Custer, and he plays him with humour and bravado. He's well matched by his best leading lady, Olivia deHavilland, who's given more of a character to work with than usual in the Flynn films, and she brings humour and decency to the role of Mrs. Custer. This was Flynn and deHavilland's final film together, and it showcases their chemistry better than their other films, especially in their farewell scene. I don't think the history behind the screenplay is very accurate, but then again, how many historical films from Hollywood are? The action scenes are well directed by Raoul Walsh (especially Custer's last stand), and it's a good balance of drama, spectacle, action, and humour. Although the film runs for nearly two and a half hours, it never seems long."
4,Movie purchase,"As advertised, came on time, my husband loved it! I am very happy with this service and will continue to use it."
4,Another American General Glorified,"So many times has Hollywood made films about life/career stories of American Generals. Take Patton for instance. Need I say more? A wonderful film in itself but, not completely accurate. Hollywood, in the 40's, could not make a movie like Saving Private Ryan. I applaud this movie for the horror and ugliness of war that it portrays. A movie like that made in the 40's would have killed morale and faith in the American war machine. That is why history needs a boost per say and a little inaccuracy for spice. This an example of just that. This is a fine story of one of America's heroes of the Civil War and the Wild West. Hollywood's rendition of his life was fairly true and the history involved in the battle was not. This film, however, was a great couple of hours of action and a little romance. Another fine classic for all Errol Flynn fans to own. He was made for this role."
5,A romantic pastiche that stands the test of time,"If one is looking for an accurate history of Custers life this is not the movie for you. However it it a wonderful film that totally stands the test of time. When ever I see it it makes me laugh one minute, and move me to tears the next. It is very powerful. Raoul Walsh as director is excellent.It is a movie full of action,comedy, drama, pathos and romance, only in the way the golden age of Hollywood could have portrade it.Especially is the unforgettable last scene of De Havilland and Flynn. It was the last time they would ever work together. These two people though never personally involved truly adored each other. The electricity of their performance is proof to that, and one of the most heart rendering scenes ever made on film.Buy it, Just seeing Errol Flynn and Olivia De Havilland together is worth the price of the DVD"
4,How to make a Dakota warrior cry,"It took me years to finally decide to watch this movie, since I'm part Dakota, and an historian, but never mind history. Watch this one for the interaction between Flynn and Olivia. They are incredible together; the onscreen chemistry that began to bubble in ""Captain Blood"" comes full circle as these two actors who adored each other on and off screen give one last amazing performance together. As Laddie5 comments,their final scene is intensely moving, because you can almost hear Errol Flynn's heart breaking, and as he delivers the ""...most gracious thing..."" line -well, if you're a Flynn-DeHavilland fan, it's tough."
2,Kindle version has problems,"As is so often the case with books that were originally physical, this Kindle version has a lot of little problems. Bad editing is less upsetting when eBooks are offered for bargain prices, but this book is not. For the price they are asking, a human should have read this cover to cover and fixed the problems.There are minor OCR problems in every chapter, but the most egregious occur where genetic crosses are explained. For example, in Chapter 9, everywhere that an F2 cross is described, you'll see something like this:""(1/4AA + '/2Aa + 114aa)""That should read (1/4AA + 1/2Aa + 1/4aa).Sure, I can puzzle it out without any struggle, but I shouldn't have to. Once you add in many other common OCR errors, like ""F,"" for ""F1"", ""Fz"" for ""F2"", and ""as"" for ""aa"", some sections become a real pain to read.The content of this book is great, but I tire of getting ripped off by publishers that won't edit their Kindle editions with the same care that they would give to a physical book."
4,Must have,"This book is really a must have even if you don't breed new varieties and only safe your own seeds. It contains a whole lot of information and is very thorough and that is what I liked as well in her other book ""The resilient gardener"".The only critique I have is that the autor seems to dislike pictures graphics and tables. That makes the chapters on genetics a real difficult read. Now it is three decades that I left high-school and even back we had pictures of tulips and DNA spirals. This here is the contrary of the modern gardening books with great pictures but no content, but some concessions to modern reading habits wouldn't have done any harm to this otherwise great book!"
5,I really like this book,I really enjoyed reading this. She gives a lot of information but she does in a way that is really interesting to read. I wanted specific information on a few things and I found it easily but it was so interesting I had to read the entire chapter. This writer is very knowledgable in seeds. I don't think I could ever be as good as the author is in garden growing but this book is going to be a great help while I try.
2,advanced,A lot more information than I was expecting. I thought it was going to be easier. I am just look at that level y.et
1,"It's made by Rockford Fosgate, need I say more?","But, don't take my word for it, read the bad reviews here:(...)I was thinking about getting this because of the price but then after googling for reviews, I found the link above and just thought I'd share it."
3,Good book,"Nice book for amatures, but I wanted a book with more photographic effects and more detailed or pro. I quickly went through this book."
3,Photo education,"There are a few useful recipes for recreating particular photographic styles, however, most of these wouldn't pass muster for even rapid comping purposes. Use what you can, discard or ignore the rest."
2,If you know photoshop...you know most of this stuff in the book,Just a pretty rehash of photoshop filters and effects.Skip it if you know photoshopIf you don't and like big picture learning this will teach you effects...but it won't teach you photoshop.
4,Complete Photoshop CS3 for Digital Photographers (Graphics Series) by Colin Smith,This is a good book however; I do miss the step by step instructions to create an photo. CS3 do is a heavy professional program and do have very much possibilities. A beginner does not know all the tools and gadgets what are build inn. The most simply case like: how to cut that part from your picture to create a better look a like photo is one of these delays. Not everybody does know how to use specific tools. This is a missing point for a really good written book.
4,Photoshop Photo Effects Cookbook,This is a truly inspiring collection of effects and devices for improving and sometimes saving disaterous pictures.A bargain at twice the price
3,Quick and to the point,"This book is great if you aren't looking for too much explanation into what you are doing. I began to read this book at my local super book store, and wrote down the information. I like this book because it gives me the information I want to do what I need to, without all the fluff and stuff of other books."
5,A book written from personal experience in the 16c by the oppressed follower of Christ- Martin Luther,"I have read this first hand experience book by 16c Christian Dr. Martin Luther, it was his last book he ever wrote, he wrote it in his late 40's early 50's. ""The Jews And Their Lies""Its a short book with fast hitting historical truths from first hand accounts...It is credible, and forward moving.It is so insightful, so invigorating, so refreshing!It's as relevant today as it ever was back then.It's a must read for anyone interested in understanding Khazars -( also known as Ashkenazim Jews, ) not to be mixed up with Hebrews -( better known today as Sephardim Jews )This book go's over the motives and aims of Khazars over the last 1200 years..."
4,Perspective,"I am a Lutheran Deacon who is part Jew by ethnicity. I have always understood that Luther's anger was over the jewish rejection of the Gospel. This book makes that clear. Some other reviewers are ""knee Jerk"" in their reaction to the work of Luther. The ironic thing is it was Luther's love for the jewish people that made him so long for their redemption. I don't agree with everything Luther said, but he was not motivated by race. He simply railed against things which he saw as an affront to the Gospel."
1,Interesting read....,How can a religion based on a series of pathetic and ridiculous lies accuse another religion of lying?
1,No Excuses,"No excuses. Martin Luther advocated the burning down of synagogues, burning Jew's homes, and the destruction of these ""blasphemers."" Hitler used these statements of Martin Luther. Many anti-Semites have. The Scriptures advocate kindness to the Jewish people, not this insane diatribe. Those of you that excuse this hateful book deserve no tolerance for yourself.Minus 5 stars."
4,Jews and their lies,"I thought that I knew a lot about Martin Luther, but this book is an interesting read."
2,2 Funny,"at first I didnt want too believe it......but the title is funnylol how credible only god knows. it dosnt make me hate anyone more ...I just broke out in laughter.......try too examine and understand individual souls regardless of race. by walking thru life that way. Everybody has a unique story too tell. yeah most lawyers are crooks......but its 2012 and they come in all shapes and sizes. I do think the the creditors are evil and thier minions they were suppose too be(finance majors) they knew what they are doing. Its a power struggle, thats why y you see alot of anti-christian stuff......bible fully exposes the creditor and tax collector as a godless soul.......what being jewish has oo do with it doesnt mean a thing cause there are jewish people who would agree with me. it is what is.....a grain of salt."
1,what a pity works like this are now so accessible,"i understand that in one way this is a genuine rant against a religion rather than a race. but it reads badly and to all those plonkers who positively review it, they abuse it to serve their own ends. so its a pity they can by being able to access it at all. take it down and all the other hate."
3,Maybe...it's true?,"Maybe, I should jump on the PC bandwagon like everyone else and yell: RACISM! ANTI-SEMITIC! HATER!However, I won't. I agree with Martin Luther and other ""evil"" men like Ben Franklin, George Washington, Robert Lewis Stevenson, Mark Twain, Winston Churchill, and Henry Ford in agreeing that the jews are liars and inherently evil. They started Bolshevism (Lenin, Marx, Trotsky) and they rule America thru the media, federal reserve, and Hollywood."
1,It's no wonder....,"Besides the expose in Constantine's Sword of what Christians have done to the Jews throughout the ages, we have Luther's infamous paper called ""The Jews and Their Lies"" I guess gentiles need someone to blame for their horrible behavior throughout the ages .... the Crusades ... the Inquisition ... the wars and massacres, etc. Luther did a good job of giving them even more ideas. I hope the Lutheran Church is proud of their author."
3,I like the rectangular one better,"I just recently bought this and the rectangular one. For some reason the rectangular one does a much better job in my opinion. I don't know if it is because it is bigger or what, but I will stick with the other one. I do love this product, but just in the other size."
2,"this is foam, not a sponge","nice shape, good design, but this is foam, not a sponge, no thank youthanks, but this is foam, not a sponge, not interested"
2,Fell apart and doesn't have scrubbing power,"These are way overpriced. If you're looking for a scrubber sponge worth it's salt, try the A & H Brande S-927 2PK Microfiber 2 in 1 Tuff Scrub. These I love."
2,Much Smaller Than Billed,"I need a man-sized kitchen sponge, but contrary to the listing, this sponge is not 7.5 inches by 9 inches; it is 4.5 inches in diameter. The product description is absolutely wrong. Similarly, the rectangular Jetz Scrubz must not be 9.2 inches by 9 inches if, as the side-by-side photo shows, it is no longer than a Scotch-Brite, so that description is also false. I will give it a try, but why are kitchen sponges all so small that they force you to wipe a counter four times instead of two, etc?"
2,i don't have yet the product,Since the 25th april today is the 27 may I haven't the product. What happend?
3,Stilted performances,"Lambert's jazz-inspired piano concerto is a fascinating work, but this performance is not one of the best."
5,Excellent,"What a great blade, I use it on my 18"" jet BS and its a godsend for re sawing and general ripping. your in no way going to do fancy scroll work or tighter ""S"" curves with this blade cause its huge but if you want to cut straight lines and resaw with little drift, this is the blade!!!"
1,supplement for old software,"I was disappointed to receive this software; it is actually an upgrade for an old version of National Geographics Topo software, not an expansion pack for the software generally. I bought the current version at the same time so I didn't need this because these features are built in to the current software. If you have an old version of the Topo software, it would probably be useful."
3,Good enough for the price,I own a high quality Eisenstat of the same magnification. I wanted something inexpensive that I could have with me without the fear of losing it. This one does the job though the fall off by astignation around the perimeter is very noticeable.
3,Suffers from distortion,"The size and shape are good, the LED light is helpful, but the lack of aspheric optics reduces the usable area considerably. Peripheral distortions are troublesome and limit its use."
3,Rectangular magnifier,I liked the shape of this magnifier for reading the newspaper. It is lightweight and folds to fit into a pocket. The on/off switch is difficult to use and we are hoping it will loosen up with use. I am not sure my elderly father will be able to turn it on and off.
4,Magnification is not high.,"The magnification is only 2x, not the stated 3x. The switch is somewhat hard to turn on but the light makes it easy to read."
5,Mom's Favorite,"Have purchased several magnifiers for my 89 year old Mom with macular degeneration, she has put all the others aside and uses this one exclusively."
2,Not good for reading,"Unlike many similar magnifiers, this one comes with a bright LED light and a switch that works well. For reading purposes, however, I found this magnifier not ideal because its circular-shaped lens focuses on only one word at a time while distorting the adjacent words. This type of lens focuses to a point such that it can concentrate sunlight to start a fire. For reading, the ""Carson Optical Lighted Magnifold Magnifier"" sold at Amazon works better."
3,Close to the print,"This is a well constructed, elegantly designed magnifier. For reading print, one must keep the glass very close to the print."
1,Disappointing,The only part of the glass that isn't distorted is a tiny circle right in the middle. You have to close one eye to look through it. This item is way overpriced for such dismal quality.
1,a waste of time and money,an unsatisfactory magnifier possibly because of it's being 3x I don't know. Have to hold it just so and very close for it to magnify.
2,disapointed,please can sum 1 email me the full list of the songs in honey n the 1 wher her dance moves are inspired by the skippers and the basketball playas please help i need d songs for my bday on sat! email me dunn328@hotmail.com thanx
3,"Yes, there are songs missing.","I'm glad they included Blaque's I'm Good on here, but I did notice there were a lot of omissions made. I have some advice to everyone-why don't you watch the ending of the movie and get all the titles to the songs, then try downloading them? It's probably a lot easier that way."
2,help plz,hey my review is pretty much the same as everyones the good songs are all on the movie but arent included in the soundtrack ur better off downloadin the songs from the movie. does neone have the movie song playlist plz email to steph_thomson87@hotmail.com ta!!
2,where is my song at?,Did anyone pay close enough attention to the music to know what song was playing while they were working at the music store? It was a slower song...I've heard it before but don't know what it is. It sounds like girls singing the chorus and some guy singing the song. I know it's a long shot but I thought someone might have recognized it...email me at boss8760@aol.com if anyone knows.
1,COME ON!!!!!!!!!!!!,oh man i am so PO'ed I was hoping that it wuld be jsut like the movie and it's not!!!!! If anyone has so good songs that I should look at like the ones from the movie PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! e-mail me A.S.A.P!!!!! thanks a lot-:)p.s the movie was AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!
3,What is THIS?!,"You know i went to go see that movie cuz of the dancing and the music and i was psyched when i saw it. I was expecting a bomb soundtrack but instead we get this, and this music wasn't even the tight stuff off the movie! What happened to that Tweet song and the one with Shawn Desman? What about Nas's version of ""Everybody wants to rule the world?"" And what about Ginuwine's tight lil number with the kids?! Man...pretty much the only good songs on this album are Missy Elliot's ""Hurt Sumthin'"", ""Thugman"", ""React"", and Tamia's ""It's a party"". I was pretty disappointed that they didn't include the others i mentioned. Hope there's a Honey Soundtrack 2 or somethin cuz it seems that i'm not the only one dissin the soundtrack..."
5,LIst of some songs from the movie - not in a soundtrack!,"Shawn Desman ""Sexy""Tweet ""Hypnotic"" (you can have it from some programas p2p, I have it from Ares)Tamia ""Into You""Lil' Mo ""4ever""Wu tang clan ""Y'all been warned""3rd store ft Clipse ""HOney""Nas ""Rule""Knocturnal ""The way I am""Mary J blige ""No more drama""Yerba Buena ""Guajira (I love u 2 much)"""
2,very disappointed,I was very disappointed to see that this soundtrack duped the movie goers. There were a lot of good songs on the movie that are missing from the soundtrack. I must say don't buy this CD. Why pay full price for the whole soundtrack when we only got half of the songs. BOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRIIIIINNNNNNGGGGG
3,Shouldn't they have music from the movie?,"I saw the movie and immediately bought the soundtrack, but what happened to all the music? I agree with the other reviews - they left off some songs that were featured in the film, and that's annoying. I wonder if they're planning a ""More songs from Honey?"" soundtrack as well?The one song I'm trying to track down is slower, and I think it had the theme from Young and the Restless looped in...It was something about a break up and moving on. If anyone can help me out with the name or artist, I would appreciate it - I can't find the full song credits for the movie anywhere."
2,Honey is an AWESOME movie... the soundtrack sucks!,"Honey was one of the hottest movies ive seen....all the songs throughout the movie were tight, but they didnt put any of the good ones on there!! If anyones wondering, the song by Tweet where she is shooting her video is called ""Hypnotic""....i noticed a lot of people wanted to know the name of it. I downloaded this song and ""Sexy"" by Shawn Desman using Piolet, but I really cant find that Ginuwine song where they are making the video for it with all the kids...i know its called ""Hot"" but i cant find it anywhere!! that song is tight and if anyone has this song or knows where to get it PLEASE email it to me at xoLaur231ox@comcast.net !!!"
2,ALL THE SONGS AREN HERE!!!!!!!!!!!,"Why have the soundtrack if all the songs in the movie aren't all there.Where is Shawns Desman's ""sexy"" at?"
2,Not bad,"Not as good as I had hoped, but I'm not a big rap/hiphop fan either. The last song made it worthwhile."
2,the song where she puts the bball and jump rope moves in,"the soundtracks just ok, but what i REALLY wanna know is either the name of the song or the artists name of the song where she adds the basketball and jump roping moves into it? ive looked all over for the song but absolutely cannot find it!! and what is the name of the shawn desman song? those 2 songs i cant find! if you happen to know any info about the songs, email me at bluebug99@comcast.net please!!! thanks!!"
3,Decent,"The soundtrack is alright nut it's missing some of the best songs and the best songs that actually MADE it to the CD are on other CD's (like the atrist's own CD). And to answer the last reviewer's question, the song with the Love & the Restless loop is Mary J Blige. The song is No More Drama and that is also the name of the CD."
2,where'd all the songs go?,yeah... where did shawn desman's song go? that was the song where everyone's dancing while he's sitting on the chair with jessica alba dancing around him... that was one song that really caught my attention from the whole movie... and not hearing it on the soundtrack bites...
3,song title?,"hey, does anybody know the name of the first song that honey danced to. it is when benny and his gang come into the class and tries to learn the dance.you can email me at krisma_creek@hotmail.comthanx"
3,the song dj scratch ?,"hi, i am looking for the song that honey brings into the center where she said something that's the remix from dj scratch and overdrive.please email me at shijialeee @ yahoo.com , many thanks!"
4,"good soundtrack, but whis part of it edited","This is good soundtrack with some good beats and 2 great tracks from missy, actaully these two tracks are better then anything on This is not a test. I also love the Tamia's joint, didnot know she is good as she is probbelly will have to buy her cds now. My only beef with this is while some of the songs are not edied, other are and the cd certianly should a have label becuase of these songs, but why give censored version of the others. This cd should have come in expicat and clean versions. Other then that pick this one up. Cant' wait for the movie it will be the bomb, were actaully maybe that's the wrong thing to say."
2,where did all the songs go?,"Where are all the songs that were in the movie like the Tweet song, Ginuwine's songs with the kids and the other songs where she was dancing the movie with the guy sitting. If anyone knows where I can get these songs to download because it is missing on the soundtrack plz email me at malika898@yahoo.com"
2,tweet song,"Hey all,I'm hoping someone can tell me the name of the song that Tweet sings in the music video...i don't think it was thugman. Email me at sleeker82@yahoo.com if you can help THANKS!!"
3,Reguarding HONEY Soundtrack,"Hey all,I have recently listened to the Honey Soundtrack, I am indifferent to it. I was wondering if anyone had a complete list of all the songs that we're played throughout the movie. I admit they didnt put a majority of the songs on the cd, and that makes me mad when they do that. If anyone has all the songs please email me at luvdmb167@hotmail.com thanks!!!!"
3,"okay, but like others say, missing too many songs","Missing too many songs, but does anyone know if it includes the song where some of the tune was the Young and the Restless theme? thanks"
2,ohh....,"I was going to go out and buy this cd, but i decided to look on here first to see what was on it and what people said about it....everyone has said it isn't that good and all the hot songs are missin', so I said forget buy this cd, maybe something else that is actually good will come out. If you find a hot cd let me know!"
5,BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!,"""Honey"" is one of da best movies I've ever seen....Jessica Alba did such a good job and the rest of the cast......the whole of idea of kids dancing and stuff was excellent.....I LOVED the music too...being a hip hop and R&B fan and all......yeah anyway in the soundtrack it doesn't have ALL the songs...like ""Hypnotic""..by Tweet....and ""Sexy"" by Shawn Desman....and yeah.....they should of put those songs on the soundtrack.....I LOVED the song ""I Believe""....its really inspirational to people wit dreams.....lol...anyway thats all folks..."
5,Does any 1 no da name of dis trak???,safe dis is meeshai am desperate 4 dat tune on honey dat comes on near da begining. she says its da new trak frm dj scratch but i cant seen to find it. it s da trak she plays wen da girl trips on water. if you know what it is or you got it plz mail me at meesha_kashb@hotmail.com. honey and the film is siickkk. i think its a great album because i love hip hop.sfe tk care
2,"where ""soar""?",i thought this cd had a xtina song's SOAR just because i saw the preview of this movie is SOAR!!!!!! i don't know........f..k
1,Don't waste your money.,The charger worked GREAT for the first 2 or 3 days.. then it just literally fell apart. It's cheaper to just buy a different brand of this charger from a store.
2,Poorly made,You get what you pay for. It is poorly made. The rim keeps coming loose and we always have re-adjust it and tighten it.
5,QUALITY NOT QUANTITY,"At this low price I can give this 5 stars although it is only 45 minutes of music. What I bought it for was to improve my knowledge of Mendelssohn which was limited to the better known works, and it is a record that has grown on me. These 2 string symphonies were written when he was about 14, and they are good and attractive music, not just accomplished apprentice-work. I don't hear in them the fully individual voice that I hear in the Midsummer Night's Dream overture or the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso or the Octet that came not much later, but these string symphonies need no condescension, and I imagine they would be established in the standard repertory if we thought they were by Schubert. The performances are excellent -- robust and lyrical as required without exaggeration or idiosyncrasies. The string tone is quite outstandingly good."
4,Great Game,"The movie this game is based on is probably my favorite movie of all time. The game does a pretty good job following the story with futuristic twists. At times the hordes of enemys get a little old but its a good time to practice moves. As far as saving goes, I am pretty sure the game saves your place every time it goes to a load screen, even though it does not advertise this it does. Who wants to quit in the middle of a chapter anyway? I found the game to be much like the movie once it was over I really wished it wasn't.As far as game play goes I wish I had more control over the camera. That's about my only complaint.I highly recommend this game, for its story line and game play. Its not an extremely hard game but after you beat normal you get a hard option.If i had to do it again I wouldn't change anything . Defiantly buy."
1,Terrible instructions and no driver for Vista,"The instruction book leaves something to be desired... it basically comes without them.The manufacturer site says it is Vista supported which is why I bought it. I installed it and Vista installs it as an 'unknown device'. I went to their site and all the downloads are for XP or earlier so I contacted support. They don't even have a Vista driver. I've never actually had a hardware company trick me into buying something when they don't even have a driver for it. Their response was ""I'm forwarding this to engineering"" and then nothing else; ever.It's a pain to hook up and it doesn't work if you use Vista so I would stay away if you plan to upgrade or already have it."
4,Brought back memories...,"I first read this book about thirty years ago when I bought the ""special"" Doubleday Book Club edition. Over the years, I lost it. My brother and I were discussing books we'd read as kids that we enjoyed, and I remembered this one. I had to order it ;)It's probably not a book that today's science fiction readers would enjoy. It's more of a space opera, with completely fantastic worlds and situations that will never come to be. It is not supposed to be reality; therein lies the meaning of ""fiction"". It's a means of escape, and I enjoyed it as much as a mature adult as I did as a young man."
2,"Confusing, stiffly written, and decidedly unpleasant","Brother to Demons Brother to Gods is a sci-fi/fantasy about a frightening future where human cloning and genetic modification have resulted in a reality populated by four phases of creation: Premen, Trumen, Mumen, and Gods. And maybe some things called Demons. Plus a legend about a creation called the Multiman, or possibly Ultiman. Confusing? You bet, not to mention stiff and unpleasant. The so-called Gods have little use for humanity as we understand it, and are wholly self-centered and contemptible, cartoon-ish, really. If Williamson's point is that genetic manipulation is just a bad idea, he's made it, but he's written a very distasteful book in the process. The choice of suffering children as protagonists is just one of Williamson's bad artistic decisions. Not recommended."
2,cool cover - weak inside,"The cover looked so promising, but once i opened this boook up and took a good look inside I was very dissappointed.It really looked like it was going to be the coolest B-boy hip hop style from back in the days book ever, but fell short in a big way in my opinion. That's too bad."
5,Awesome female etherial music,"Few bands are essential to a music collection but LSD is perhaps the flagship of the ""Heavenly Voices"" genre.Like much on the Projekt label, they are under appreciated, but if you like excellent etherial ""heavenly voices"" or ""angelic"" music, buy all three of their CD's. You won't regret it."
5,Ethereal,"I saw Love Spirals Downward play in Chicago over ten years ago. This album was their current release at the time. This is a gorgeous slice of dreamy acoustic pop backed with touches of electronic percussion and keyboard affects. Ryan Lum is a fantastic musician, weaving many textures together into a rich tapestry to back the delicate vocals of Suzanne Perry. Sometimes her voice seems little more than a whisper, very dreamlike. In fact, the whole album has the feel of a peaceful dream, beautiful and pure. This is still one of the most lush, pretty recordings in my collection."
1,Swiss Army Watch,"The reason I give this watch 1 star, is b/c one of the hands on the watch broke after one month of normal wear. Now unfortunately, I have to send the watch away and who really knows when I will receive another one."
1,Great book - binding broke upon first reading,"This was a wonderful book. HOWEVER, I am extremely disappointed in that the binding broke during the first reading. Unfortunately, it was a gift that was given just a day after the return window closed, so we are out of luck with a broken book."
3,Factual but fun,"I thought this book was neat. It told how lobstermen take care of their equipment and how they catch lobsters. It was neat how the boy caught the biggest lobster. I wouldn't say this book is for everybody, but it tells you about a different way of life."
5,Very interesting and well-written,"This is a great magazine whether you live in Maine or have just visited and are fond of the state. It looks at life along the coastwith a focus on boats but it's not JUST about boating. Food, houses, nature, fine art are all covered--some good recipes! The writing is really good and kind of timeless. We keep it at our summer place and guests pick up old issues and read them cover to cover--heck, we do too!"
1,CD does not work well. Many mistakes,CD does not work well with windows XP. Many questions are empty. Answer explanation is not comprehensive.
1,bad job,"I'm mother-tongue french and this DVD is so bad done. First of all they mostly speak in English, then the scenes are poorly done. I don't suggest to anybody to buy this DVD."
4,As good as Volume 1,"My little dauther loves it. We are not native English speakers. We are native Spanish speakers learning French as a second language, so I would prefer less English speaking on the DVD."
2,Pezi has the most annoying voice EVER!,"I bought this for my three year old. The idea was that I would watch it with her to guide her in her french learning. But Pezi's voice is so terrible I can hardly stand it. I can't believe no one else mentions this in their reviews?! My daughter doesn't seem to mind as she seems entranced by the ""big kids"" - but she gets frustrated by the ""game"" which doesn't work on our DVD player and can't be skipped, forcing us back to the main menu to pick the next chapter. Even though it was relatively inexpensive, I don't recommend it. For a non educational video, but nice exposure to french - we both enjoy the Barbapapa cartoons but you can't get them on amazon.com"
4,They saved the best for last,"This dvd is the last medabots dvd I know about, but the best one.These episode are about the world tornament its a 3 on 3 match witch I think is pretty cool.Plus Ikki teams up with Koji its like naruto and sasuke you always seen Ikki and Koji fighting but this time they will have to work togather.On the good side its Ikki,Koji and a new comer the space metafighter its some girl in a mask.On the bad Side its Victor the champ and his 2 partners and let me tell you that They dont call him the champ for nothing.His medabot Warbandit is really strong it can take on 3 medabots at the same time and this is only have the dvd."
3,Flowery Family Folly,"In this second book of a series, Bretta Soloman has moved from the home she shared with late husband Carl (see Roots of Murder) and undertaken the renovation of a neglected mansion. Set during the busy Christmas season, Bretta is a busy and ambitious florist, hoping to cash in on the season of spending. However, the tale takes more of a Halloween turn when the former owner of the mansion is strangled with the cord of some Christmas lights. Fast paced, the timing seems off in this book, and too many different components come into play. The widowed Bretta has fallen off her diet, her long lost father has made contact, and the former owner of her new home has made some interesting demands, and Bretta has issues with the sheriff. A few red herrings are to be expected in a cozy mystery, but this one meandered past the point of plausibility on many counts. A baffling ""flower"" arrangement, with too many design elements?"
4,Mistletoe is a Parasite,"The second in the ""Gardening Mysteries"". This time Bretta Solomon is trying in vain to enjoy her new home - the renovated Mansion of the Beauchamp family of women. She encounters death during a holiday viewing of the new home. Thus, begins the search for the murderer."
3,a movie,A good controversial movie about a run away growing living on the streets. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
2,Bad,"Bad movie, more like an after school made for tv special. Don't waste your money on this one. I threw it away after watching it."
4,a small gem,"It is well directed, and it has a surprise over the story is not as flat as others, nad it keep You minf on the film, I liked the script, and also it was well acted."
3,Jet Boy,The movie does not have closed-captioned for hearing impaired people. The movie plot is difficult to understand and have to guess what the actors are saying in the movie plot of Jet Boy. The movie is okay but hard for hearing impaired people to know what is happening in the movie story.
2,Overhyped!,"I read 4 pages of positively glowing reviews before deciding to purchase this item. It would seem that would make it a sure sign of its' product quality. Although, brave in its concept and the young actor who plays the wronged victim of systemic child abuse, it is a weak effort overall. Goes to show how different cinematic tastes can be from person-to-person."
4,good movie.,"A movie about sex, prostitution, drugs, and incest. A bit more gay scenes and a little less happiness, defiantly at the end. kind of ruined it."
4,Good,I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. It surpassed my expectations. It's been a long time since I enjoyed a movie so much.
4,An excellent and unusual film,"This is a remarkably good film about an unusual subject. If I said that it is the story of a very young rent boy, you might easily be put off. Happily, it is much more than that. It is about bravery and persistence against the odds. It is also a feel-good mystery story in which nothing is what it seems. The boy is superbly well played by Dylan Walsh, a remarkable young actor who holds your attention all the time he is on the screen. One mystery is, is the boy naturally homosexual, or simply 'gay-for-pay'? It is a sobering and often uncomfortable story about what some people have to do in order to survive. Full marks to the Canadians for this first class film.However, I would love to know in what way the directors cut differs from the original which I already have. Are there any significant differences, or is this just another marketing 'come on'?"
5,Her #1 Fan,I absolutely love this item. Beyonce' is the best there is so I knew I would love it no matter what. She gives her all and I know that her other fans appreciate it as much as I do. I love Beyonce'
1,Blu-ray???? :-(,So Disappointed not to get a Blu-Ray release of this performance.How is it possible? All of her previous releases were released on Blu as well!
3,Must See DVD,This great dvd. Beyonce opens up about her beginnings in the industry to where she is now. She is very inspiring. The performances are entertaining and the behind the scenes are nice to see her off the stage in different stages of times.
3,"Not Bad, but Not the best","I love Beyonce and think she is one of the best talents out there. The begining of this concert, is very similar I Am.... Yours (which is wayyyyyyyyyy better). She does alot of Destiny Child songs and the songs that she does perform from her past 3 albums, are too brief. I would like it, at least at this point in her career, for her to stick to her solo albums. She has always been a great performer and she is in this concert, but the format and songs choosen dont leave much of an impression. Most of Beyonce's concert DVD's are awesome, but this one I would skip."
3,Not the best Beyonce concert DVD,"This DVD is nothing special, and this is coming from a Beyonce fan. It's nice to hear the 4 tracks, but it just starts off too slow. This might as well be the I Am... Yours DVD with the same ""story telling"" part. It's like she thinks nobody has seen her concert DVD's. A plus, there's brand new footage from Bey's personal home videos, but they come in small clips. If this is your first time buying a Beyonce concert DVD, check out the other ones. This one won't impress you."
1,Too Heavy On Destiny's Child Songs,"Granted that Beyonce is a great entertainer with a gift for singing songs with incendiary rhythms and beats. Clearly, her voice is in fine form with its new gospel-inspired stylings. But this video does not do anything to inform the viewer about the film's subject, Beyonce. It feels very over-polished, slick, and completely forgettable.It's too heavy on material from her DC period, and the story-telling aspect of the show wears on the viewer after a while cuz you never get hear full versions of the songs. The video clips interspersed between performances does nothing to create the sense of intimacy with the entertainer as most concert footage should do.In the end, the viewer is left feeling unsatisfied and wonderding if the purchase of this DVD was worth the money. It isn't. Watch one of her other performance DVDs if you want to experience her live performances without braving the elements, astronomical parking fees, and suffocating/overexuberant crowds."
3,Better than nothing. But WHY not on Blu-ray??!,"I really don't understand these Sony people! What's wrong with them? Why not a Blu-ray release too? On Youtube there are 2 offficial fragments in 1080P, so it must've been recorded in HD. Why then only release an inferior DVD??!"
5,Highley Recommended for Beyonce fans,"I enjoy all of Beyonce movies, music, and so on...I was glad to find her live performance at Roseland on DVD, I absolutely love the Elements of 4 and the home video clips that ""B"" added in from her childhood years and other leisure. This was a great addition to my Beyonce collection, I am looking forward to more :) from 1 Beyonce fan to another."
5,Wish I was there!,"Best performance from her wish it was blu-ray,loved it anyway love all of her songs the only thing I wish it was longer!"
4,Outstanding Performance..!!!,I have been a great fan of Beyonce... this DVD is simply outstanding... Can't wait to have it in Blu-ray...
2,Pass...,"The concert DVD is identical to everything Beyonce has already done. Time after time, she is repeating the same routines... I for one am tired of it. Most of the show is devoted to Destiny's Child's music. Beyonce has enough music of her own to finally stop performing the songs of her former group. I think it's tacky. On top of that, there is a little too much video footage being thrown in while the focus should be on what's happening on the stage. I hope Beyonce has her child, takes a few years and returns with a BRAND NEW act/show leaving Destiny's Child melodies and the same things she's been doing for years now."
3,"Solid and enjoyable, suited for those long car rides..","I really tried to find another way to describe this, but sometimes you gotta call a spade a spade. This an album of bona-fide tech house. Feels like disco, without the loops but with mechanically rhythmic pacing, but more organic and soulful than straight-up techno, but without the girly vocals...you get the point.Peak time digital disco then? Sensibly energetic cuts that don't really beg for a rewind, yet worth playing start to end. A few are a notch above: Alexi Delano (ADNY) and Jesper Dahlback's crunchy `Neuva York' and Dano's own thickly textured `Downpressman,' while the now-overplayed `Free at Last' and Stevie Wonder's `Higher Ground' tribute `Something Wonderful' are a bit below the curve.Need to eat up miles of highway for a long car trip? This's the soundtrack to keep you bopping along."
5,Love it,"I love everything about this book. I love that it's cloth, I love the story, I love the pictures, and I love the ""pedals."" My 2 year old is finally figuring out how to squeak the 2 pedals that squeak, other than that she was never interested in the pedals. But she does like the story and likes me to read it to her."
4,This book has been quite helpful,"When I got a new laptop for Christmas, it came with Vista, instead of the XP that I was used to. I found that I had quite a few questions and and started shopping for a book. This one has proven to be very useful and layman friendly for the most part."
5,Vista Home Basic,"Have begun reading this book, and have found it to be just what I need to learn what I don't know about the computer I bought 2 years ago!Being able to purchase this book through Amazon was extremely helpful since I didn't want to spend a lot of money for a book that I had not seen before. But it was inexpensive and shipped promptly to my home."
3,hmmm......,"Not one of their best but ""Edward the Mad Shirt Grinder"" will make you jump out of your skin. That one song alone is worth the price of the album. I had no idea a piano(s) could do things like that."
2,Difficult to use,"I bought this stand to use with a dual-purpose motorcycle, a Suzuki DRZ-400SM. The SM is lower to the ground than a dirt bike and required an inordinate amount of effort to lift. I weigh about 180 lbs and could not lift the ~300lb bike by standing on the lever.It requires assembly (about 30 minutes) and appears to be well-made, but may be suited only for very light dirt bikes with more than 12"" ground clearance."
4,Sweet and fanciful,I read this book to some kids I was babysitting and I was so pleased I took a picture of the cover so I could remember it. This book was cute. I loved the art and the different characters the dragon went to. I thought it was so sweet that it ended with the dragon finding his mother.
3,They also composed for the organ,"This CD is an important contribution to this series of CDs on different national schools of organ music. We associate composers like Glinka, Taneyev, Lyapunov, Glazunov, Khachaturian and Shostakovich with orchestral music and not with organ music. So it is very interesting to hear what these composers did when composing for the organ. A second aspect of the CD (as with the others in the series) is that the works are in chronological order of birthdates of the composers, so one can hear how the styles have changed over a period of more than a hundred years. Thirdly, the recordings were not all made on the same organ, and it is interesting to hear the different organ sounds. Fourthly, it comes at a reasonable price. Having said all that, this is really an esoteric CD for musicologists and fundis of the organ. There is not much that will readily appeal to the lay listener, not much of a 'Wow! Listen to that!' response. Bear that in mind before you order."
5,More than just a football book,"I bought this book as a long-time college football fan and found it to be one of the best sports books I have read. Much more than just football, this book tells the stories of the players and coaches and is a wonderful look at life and sports in the 1930's. All of this makes this a great read for sports fans or just those who remember what life was like in 1934. A truly inspirational story of one team's refusal lose against incredible odds."
5,Great,Just bought the book because my Grandfather Stan Fuller was one of the eleven iron men of Yale..Thanks for writing the story of the Yale players-
3,Return,"The item was returned because son had already had one, however no credit for the refund has been received. Mgroncall@msn.com"
1,Poor Quality/impractical,"The net is very poorly made, it is not portable and it takes two people to set up. I've actually knocked down the net with a couple shots. Not worth the money!"
1,Poor Quality Net,After a few times of using this net the balls go right through it.Made of thin material that streches very fast.
4,3 in 1 Golf Practice Set Mat Driving Net Chipping Net and Bag,"Rubber tee broke quickly. Doesn't hold up will in stronger breezes. Spikes are short so they don't hold well in softer ground. Otherwise, it works fine!"
1,Poor net!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The product looks great in the picture but when I got it I set it up and the second time I used it I blasted two golf balls through the net this is a very poor product it will not stop your golf balls so just a heads up out there to anyone thinking of buying this product I hope you dont have close neighbors because more than likely your golf balls is gonna be in their yard or throw their window!!!!! Im returning it
3,okay,it is a little flimsy and doesnt stay in place...It is not a bad product I just expected more I guess
2,Didn't hold up,"This product works great, though it was a challenge for 3 of us to put together. The illustrated instructions (with very few words) are not very helpful. Once together, the product worked great. However, the stakes used bent easily. We had some wind come through and one of the fiberglass poles snapped just below a connection point. My husband is in the process of trying to fix it. In all, we've had it less than one month and only been able to use it a few times. If I thought we could return it, I would."
1,Unhappy golfer,"To start with the Practice net and chipping net were delivered quickly and the packaging was excellent. Although I have read it takes two to assemble, I was able to do it by myself with little problems. It does work as described. I have been putting it up and taking it down before and after each use but today I decided to leave it up while I went to work out. Imagine my surprise to find in laying on the ground when I returned one and one half hours later. I attempted to put it back up but due to a broken pole I was unable to get it reassembled. I have read reviews where some have left it up all the time. With my experience I'd advise everyone to take it down after each use. My hope is, a new pole or even two are shipped to me as a way to say sorry and we appreciate you as a customer. I have not had contact with the manufacture so this chapter has not been closed."
1,Bad net,Key issue for any hitting net: net stops balls. This net fails that test. I've had the net four weeks and have blasted two holes (i.e. tears) in the netting already. Weak and flimsy net. I'm ditching it and buying Izzo or Callaway.
3,Works great for beginners,"For people trying to get their wedges better and aim their trajectory, taking a 1/2 or quarter swing, or for taking a light drive into it to work on ball contact it works great. When I took a half swing with a 5 iron, I blew right through the net taking out a tree and couple of houses. Beginners need to stick with this item, advanced golfers look elsewhere."
1,Be warned! Can drive holes,"The set up was fairly easy although it takes a lot of space. The first time I used it I broke the rubber part of the small mat they give you. The second time I used it, I sent a 4 wood through the net and into the neighborhood somewhere (lucky, no broken windows). I am returning it. If a net doesn't stop the ball, it is unsafe to use. I don't hit the ball particularly hard (driver usually in the 250 yard range), so be forewarned."
4,Good for the price,"Shipping time : ok, product: complete...quality: good for the price...Not safe with real golf balls... Use practice balls....(callaway practice balls are ok)"
1,Junk,"This product was cheap, so I guess u get what you pay for. Net failed and the whole thing would knock over"
5,Songs from old soundtrack still get an A!,This album is great! I rented the film the Devil and Max Devilin and Julie Budd sang two terrific songs and so I bought the album and I love it. The songs are great pop of the early eighties. I dont know why Julie was not more popular. Her voice along with the great song writing and music make these timely and entertaining.
5,Pure Imagination - In Every Sense of the Word,"Of all the Julie Budd albums released in the past decade, this is my personal favorite. From Julie's sweet flowing-like-honey vocals to the magical orchestral arrangements, it's clear that this album was recorded and produced with nothing less than spellbinding ""pure imagination"". Put this CD in your player and play it - it's bound to take you away.- John Wellborn"
5,GReat Read!!,I actually bought this book for a friend as I already owned a copy myself. Its a very inspiring read and I would suggest it to others.
5,This book changed my life.,This book gave me a different way of looking at illness and lack of funds in my life. It showed me there are many possibilities in life that I had never before seen. It is a New Thought way of looking at God and ourselves and the relationship between the two. Our church spent 8 weeks doing a chapter or so a week to discuss it. We all agreed it was life-stimulating and life-changing.
1,Don't waste your money,"This book starts off a little strange, but then becomes decidedly weird. Basically, this guy's thought is that you and the universe (higher power, knowledge, whatever) are one and that you have all knowledge and ability in you already. You just have to realize that you are your own savior. Once I got that message, I knew I didn't need to read the rest."
5,Create the power to self-heal,"If you want to explore the power of self-healing, this is the book to read. Lolette Kuby experienced a instantaneous healing of breast cancer and shows how this ability is available to anyone. As a cancer survivor myself i found this book to be very inspiring and supportive. It helped me find faith in my own healing ability.David Elliot, author of ""You Don't Have to Die When Your Doctor Says"""
3,For Fans Only,"This book is for die hard fans only. Lets face it, Magical Mystery Tour has some great songs, but the film plays like a bad acid trip. And maybe it was! Brian Epstein had recently died and the Beatles were managing themselves. Tony Barrow takes you ""behind the scenes"" of this disjointed film. True fans of the group will enjoy the book."
1,Scamed,"This is a waist of money even if it was 5 bucks it still does a lossy job and doesn't do the double flare correctly, It give a very thin double flare the dye's suck who ever machine them should be shot hung dragged behind a speeding Locomotive for 500 miles Bottom line buy a tool that works even if you have to spend the money. It cost more in the long run if you have to keep doing the job over and over"
5,FANTASTIC BOOK!!!!!,"Fantastic Book! I read this book in 2 days! Pictures are great! It's not like those yucky fiction books, but instead it's non-fiction, it's how it really happened! I read this and thought it was great, and I gave it to my friend to read and he thought it was great to! I highly reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys history or Titanic!"
1,Don't buy this version.,"My son and I were reading this book together. We were on the edge of our seat! When we got to page 58 the ship was beginning to sink, then the book skipped to page 91. There was a whole section missing. This was a new book and there was nothing missing from the spine of the book. I would recommend ording a different version if you don't want to be left hanging......."
4,Titanic sinks,Amazon book reviewTitanic sinkThis incredible book has all the good including details and it has many different topics. Also this book includes highlighted well-behaved main ideas in this story. Certainly this book can break many peoples heart and want to make them cry. Mainly this book is a true event I think you should read this attractive book. Although I didn't know all this interesting facts am learning how to be safe on ships if I ever go on a ship trip I think you should read this book because you will get very interesting. If you read this book you will get shocked like this never happened. Although you have to read this amazing book.
5,Perfect Music for Practicing Tai Chi,"My instructor used this music in our Tai Chi class, so I wanted to have one for practice at home. It makes practice more entertaining and is calming and easy to listen to. There are different lengths of music for the short form and the long form."
3,Music for sport?,"The CD was upbeat and easy to listen to. However, it was kind of repetative. And I don't anyone who practices Tai Chi at that tempo. Good for background music though."
4,Great O/S for its time,Ubuntu's Latest versions are currently in the 8's but if you want a great intro to Linux {Thats the complete operating system Windows DOESN'T want you to know about ;)} Then this is a great place to start. I've run Linux in my home for 8 years now and have wanted for nothing. Matter of fact a few of my Windows pals want to know how they can get some of MY features as even the new Vista still doesnt have what years old Linux versions came with standard.
4,"Very enjoyable, well written business book","I found this book to be extremely well written, easy to read and full of fresh ideas. Being a business owner rather than a marketing executive, I found it to be very enjoyable and interesting reading. It certainly has helped me in my business strategic planning, marketing, and general business practices."
1,What a bunch of crap,Just rehash the same old stuff that basic branding has been teaching us all for years. A bunch a crap.
3,I wanted to have a breakthrough in this book....didn't happen,"I have read many leadership books the last few years and I decided to read to this book because my company is transitioning to using the ""challenger"" marketing system. All I can say is that I hope the marketing changes my company makes are better than this book. This is one of the most disjointed and difficult leadership books I have read. So many examples of success stories yet I felt the author never clearly states how to implement an effective marketing campaign. Just reviewing this book and not judging the success of the companies that use it, it took me a week to slog through the 300 pages and it felt like a chore just finishing the pages. This may be one of those books that have to be read a couple of times (I hope not) to really get to the core meaning. In summary, not recommended for the casual reader of leadership books."
4,Great Insight!,Really enjoyed how the author encourages you to look at other businesses unrelated to your field then bring back lessons learned to your situation. Our business will be using these lessons in a strategy review for a relaunch. Highly recommend for sales and marketing people to gain a fresh perspective.
2,Eat the big fish or jump the big shark?,"I know there are some good strategic ideas here but I was incredibly put off by the misinformation right up front about people's media habits and media consumption patterns across media. the data is incredibly wrong, such as the relative time on the internet vs watching TV (as a media industry expert I know what is considered to be gold standard measures) so the book is a bit of a house of cards. anyone can contact me at joel@rubinsonpartners.com for more specifics."
4,Review,"Love this game. Wished I'd bought it sooner. For those who ever wished for a little more comedy in a game, this is one for you. Has multiple difficulty modes, the only one NOT there is ""Easy"". Interesting story that can keep you confused or wanting to hurry up and find out more. Anything you didn't quite before, you can go to some of the in-game libraries and look for a slightly detailed (or simpler) explanation (i.e., a description of what a fonon was). Only until I looked in an in-game book did I really get what was going on at the start of the game. Either way, it was a significant buy."
5,Tales of the Abyss,The game has excellent graphics. Lots of adventures. 6 playable characters makes the game more challenging. It is a 4 player game so your friends can play also.
4,so far....,i like this game. my only complaint is that the main character has an annoying voice. doesn't fit the image of him at all. will update soon when i beat the game.*boof* Fire XD
2,not the best tales game,I bought this because I enjoy the tales series and i wanted to play an rpg because I only have a wii and a ps2. The main character is not very likeable and his blonde haired boyfriend isn't either. The story is not good at all and I played a good 15 hours into this game. It was also annoying when I got to this particular dungeon and ran out of gels.............. after that I felt it wasn't worth it. I am playing tales of symphonia: dawn of the new world now and love it! I would recommend this game to anyone! Go get that game instead it is for the wii! Also that stupid blue rat gets annoying and isnt even funny.
2,"Starts OK, gets better, then gets worse","I don't ask much from a game, but button mashing is one thing that drives me nuts. The game seems to stop for scenes all the time. What is the point in giving me control over the character to take two steps to start a movie, then get control and take three steps to start a movie. That is how this game starts (and many others) and then that is how this game ends. The middle is pretty good but about 30 hours into it I could not wait for it to end and even skipping anything extra it still took another 15 hours to finish. It was not bad enough to just give up but darn close."
1,Throw this game into the abyss! LOL,"What is this piece of crap? Terrible cartoonish graphics, horrendous voice acting, especially compared to Chaos Wars, a simple fighting system that'll make you snore, and a boring, unoriginal storyline. Seriosuly, my wet dreams have better stories than this.For a good PS2 RPG, play Chaos Wars or Final Fantasy X2.Update: Well, there IS one good thing about this game. Me and Pedobear agree that Anise is nice loli."
5,Do not underestimate the vacuum,"I loved this book so much that I bought a half dozen copies to give to my dog-loving friends. The way that Terry Bain twists the everyday world from a dog's point of view is both brilliant and hillarious. I highly recommend this book to anyone that has a dog and ever has wondered what she was thinking.Signed,The One Who Sneaks Me Food From The Table."
1,Worst Dog Book I've Ever Read,"I collect dog books ... all kinds of dog books. Also, I have a good education - BA in English & MS in Psychology, so I don't consider myself stupid, just average. This book was terrible. Poorly written. Did not grab me & make me want to know this dog. Bain was trying to be funny, but failed miserably. There are really much better dog books out there that will move the reader to laughter, to tears, to musing, & then when you're done, want to make you just hug your dog for forever. Bain doesn't even come close. Anyone want to buy a book --- cheap?"
5,Another Dog Author Tells it Like it Is,"My dog Goody Beagle loved this book. Here's what she said (sort of): ""I was delighted to find another dog author smart enough to conquer the nearly impenetrable thicket of human language, and generous enough to educate humans on who we dogs really are. You the Dog, I wish we lived close enough to do sniff-butt; I have a feeling I'd really like you. Of course you would like me too, and we could meet up at the dog park and smell in all the corners. Love, Goody Beagle."""
1,"I didn't like it in college, and it has gotten outdated.","We used this book in college, but it was unpopular.I just checked the table of contents of the new edition, and it's gotten out-of-date. Itignores the great developments in the subject that have occurred since the mid-1990s.I would recommend downloading John Preskill's physics 219 course notes fromCaltech if you want to see what I'm talking about."
1,not a great book...,"I'm using this book for a graduate sequence in quantum physics and quite frankly the book does a great deal of ""hand waving"" when it really should be going into great depth on some of these topics. For instance, the author ""includes"" topics on wiley's website that really should remain in the book. The book is OK, not great, and not my choice for studying advanced quantum mechanics.Cheers."
3,Look Elsewhere,"First, in defense of the text, there is a focus on the physically interesting material, while extraneous mathematical stuff has been skipped. However, the text is too hard for an introduction, but skips too much material to be a comprehensive guide. Perhaps as the second or third quantum mechanics book on your shelf, this book will do, but not as the first. For the mathematically inclined look to Sakurai (Modern Quantum Mechanics (Revised Edition)). For a very readable if non-standard approach see Feynman (volume 3 ofThe Feynman Lectures on Physics (3 volume set) (Set v)). Or, for a lighter intro see Griffiths (Introduction to Electrodynamics (3rd Edition))."
1,Read somthing else.,"This book is by far the worst treatment of quantum mechanics I have ever laid eyes on. If you really want to learn, check out the book by ""Introduction to Quantum Mechanics"" David Grifiths or ""Principles of Quantum Mechanics"" R. Shankar(my favorite). Oddly enough, there are far more mistakes in the third edition of Gasiorowicz than the second.... it is garbage."
2,Save it for later,"To call this an introductory text is ridiculous. We used it in my first quantum course and everyone hated it. I got another text from the library and stuck to that. This book is better suited as a reference for someone who is already familiar with quantum theory. If you use it to learn QM for the first time, it will leave you thinking that physics has nothing to do with physical reality at all, but rather with mathematical tricks. He almost never mentions the physical meaning of whats going on with the math. Very discouraging for the novice. If you want people to think you're smarter than you are, buy this book. Just don't tell them that you don't understand it either when they're flipping through it."
2,Seriously lacking in detail,"The author glosses over things without even hinting that there may be details missing. While the book does offer decent explanations on certain topics, it downright ignores important details that will leave anyone new to the material completely lost. The section on wave packets was the nail in the coffin for me. The author jumps from the initial Gaussian form to the solution without even mentioning that a fourier transform had taken place or why extra terms had suddenly appeared. Trying to use this book as an introductory text is brutal and completely ineffective."
2,Not Good,"The book is not well written and rather disorganized. I read each chapter carefully. However, I am always very confused after I finished reading. The book did not show all the important steps in the derivation of formula. The examples are usually not relevant to the homework problems. Neither the examples nor the problems improve your understanding of the theory developed in the chapter. If you are forced to use this book in a class and find it not suitable for you, I recommend you to use Griffith(2nd ed.) as a supplement."
1,"Do not buy this book, it is not worth [the money]","This book is so worthless it even fails as a door-stop (barely 500 pages). His absolutely poor mathematical treatment is only outshadowed by his the innumberable amount of typos. He attempts to cram all of quantum mechanics into a book that fits in your pocket and the only thing that happens when you pick it up, is you gain five pounds. Change your major, drop out, or find a new interest before buying this book. I recommend R. Liboff's ""Introductory Quantum Mechanics"" either 3rd or 4th edition."
1,bad textbook,"This textbook was terrible. Not only is it full of errors and typos in the equations (despite being in the second edition), but the notation is also confusing and inconsistent. There are almost no examples, and very little coherence in the explanatory text. I bought it because it was required for the course, but Shankar's standard Intro Quantum text is much better."
4,Quantum Mechanics As simple as it gets,This is a simple as it gets. Good historical overview and intro.
2,Weakest book on quantum mechanics,"I had to use Gasiorowicz for 8.04 at MIT which another reviewer metioned to imply that this book is a good text choice. 8.05 uses Griffith's book which is a much better introduction to QM. Gasiorowicz contains weak explanations and attempts to be terse but fails miserably. Use Libboff or Cohen and Tannouji or any other QM text youll learn much more conceptually with much less reading. The only reason somebody would use this book would be if they had read and understood another QM textbook and wanted to needlessly read a bad book on a subject they know. If I wanted to do that I would read ""Cartoon Guide to Physics""."
1,"Worst for Introduction, Good for review","I Have read both Liboff, Griffiths, mcGervey and a few others and I have still not found as bad a book for introducing quantum. Besides the number of typos, the author skips mathematical steps like crazy without giving the slightest reason. In addition he just sites principles which you will not know the slightest bit about from reading this book. Most students in my class appear to have turned to Liboff at this point in time and I do not know of a single admirer of Gasiorowicz in my class, AND the semester is almost over!!!I suggest a combination Liboff for a rough idea of quantum and then Griffiths for an excellent and beautiful grasp of the concepts (introductory level of course.)P.S. - You just have to get over Griffiths placing the Schrodinger equation on the first page and then you're off."
2,"Complete but lacks motivation, examples, and pedagogy","This is a complete and comprehensive review of Quantum Mechanics. Unfortunately, the text is best suited for someone with previous knowledge of the field and superior skills in mathematics of physics at a higher level than the book is actually used in (Upper-Division Undergraduate Physics). The book lacks cohesiveness required to tackle an abstract subject like quantum mechanics and skips many steps which are non trivial to the untrained reader. The book has essentailly no examples. It is good book for someone who has already done the subject but has forgotten it and wishes to relearn some of the concepts but is very confusing and shocking as a first book in this subject."
2,No organization,"There is one and only one thing wrong with this book - it does not teach QM conceptually by building on Mechanics. Instead it just states stuff, giving no reason for why things are done as they are. Overall, this book is terrible - bad for undergrads who will learn little, and horrible for grads who won't learn principles. Wiley has compounded the problem by moving large portions of the book online - WTF is up with that? Am I paying for a paper copy of the book or for internet access to a PDF? The sooner this book goes out of print, the better. The sooner Wiley goes out of business, the (even) better."
5,How whoud you like to be in a desert full of monsters?,"Lief, Barda and Jasmine left the city of rats in flames, they have to go to the Shifting Sands. I liked it because the gradian is with them at all times. The Gery Guards fellow them in to The Shfiting Sands. Lief most be brave to risk his life for Del."
3,The imposing sands,"After leaving the dreaded city of the rats, Lief, Barda and Jasmine cross barren wastelands to obtain supplies and food for their next destination.They find a busy town Rithmere and enter a fighting contest which they win.But even though they come out with jewels and riches they are kidnapped by the evil grey guards and taken to a secret hide-out, the hide-out of the adventuring Doom, and his resistence.There they are taken prisoner, will they ever be able to reach their next destination, the invincible and rather evil sands, the shifting sands?This book is a little dull and is losing the context the pre books had.It's still good!"
5,the best live band currently out there,"The Mars Volta are simply the most exciting, energetic, and awe inspiring live band out there. Seeing them twice, I can tell you from experience that those two shows were the best shows I have ever seen. With their improv jamming and extended songs, listening to them live is an experience that is quite different from their studio work. This EP is an excellent showcase of a few of their live songs. Recorded wonderfully, this four song EP clocks in at just over 40 minutes (yes, the songs are that long! I once watched them play 6 songs in over 2 hours!).There are a couple times where Cedric messes up on the lines, or Omar might play a wrong note, but it adds to the beauty of the album; it shows that they are not perfect and that they are willing to throw in some mistakes to make it seem more live, which many bands do not do with their live albums. If you are a Volta fan and do not own this EP, buy it...now."
1,Disappointing effort from former king of improv.,"Outpatients is a mediocre effort from the former champion of improf and off the wall humour. This is a studio effort with Gary Owens (the voice in Crank Calls). Winters no longer has the panache and madness fans have always known him for. When a new cd has a track featuring an imitation of Johnny Carson, Jimmy Stewart, or John Wane (tracks 6, 3, and 13) (voiced by Rich Little) you know somebody's out of touch and out of date.If you really really want a Jonathan Winters cd to add to your collection, then this might fit the bill. Otherwise, this is nort worth it.I am a Jonathan Winters fan and keep hoping someone somewhere will release the old material. I bought this because I am a fan, I am probably going to return it."
4,A Good Start,"Alternative rock that doesn't show a lot of range is found here. Moments like ""To Fly"" - a roaring anthem - are rare. Josh's voice sounds a bit restrained here too."
5,God even saves rock stars,"What an amazing story of josh brown. I used to listen to Full devil jacket before I got saved and wondered what happend to them then one day I received my Bmg music club book and this was in there and i found out were Josh brown had got to. I am so glad he did make A decision for Christ. God loves all and I hope to see more rock stars get saved. I like rain song, corner stone the best but the whole album rocks. I here there New one comes out in june cant wait. May God bless all who reads this review"
4,Great Debut!,"I saw these guys live and was blown away by their energy and driving sound. I bought their cd and was not disappointed! This disc is simple, straightforward rock. No frills, no complex lyrics, no complex music for that matter. Just rock....and it works. A great cd which speaks volumes about one man's faith and a life changed. My favorites are ""I Am The Door"", ""To Fly"", and ""Jacob's Dream"". The riffs on that song are what power rock is about. I can't wait for their sophmore cd."
5,GODS BAND,"I think this band is,gods words each and evrey song is so powerfull and just will move you like no band has ever,like if u feel like your life is over thow this cd on and u will see theres more for u in life and that god loves you."
3,Eh...this CDs okay I guess...,"I got this CD based on hearing the first song, but i got more and more dissapointed as the Cd went on. All the songs sound the same and the tunes arent really that catchy. But hopefully they will improve on their next CD..."
2,Repetitive and uncreative,"Yup..those are two of the biggest problems with Day of fire. They have an overused hard rock/grunge sound to begin with, and all the songs on the album sound exactly the same. Cornerstone, Through the fire and Time stand out on their on, whereas the rest of the songs sound too formulated. Hopefully there next release will be a bit more creative."
3,"Same Sound, Too Many Bands","I like the D-tuned sound, the raspy vocals, the driving guitar...but does EVERY song have to sound so similar? Too many of the newer ""modern rock"" bands don't have a uniqueness about them, and this seems to be another one. I do like the message in their lyrics though and am glad to see another Christian rock band come on the scene, but mix it up a bit fellas!"
5,Moving Messages Set to Awesome Music,"This c.d. has moving messages set to awesome music!This music has both a rock and inspirational feel.I was slightly shocked, actually, to walk into a clothing store where I usually hear mostly alternative rock and pop music, but heard the song, ""Fade Away"".I thought, ""Wow, a Christian song is being played in a place where Christian music is not typically found!"" I was excited!A five star rating, in my opinion, does not fully do this c.d. justice."
5,Wonderful soothing music!,"My whole family (including 9 and 10-year old children) loves this delicate, soothing music. It is perfect when we arrive from a tiring day, or to settle everyone down before bed. There are many interesting chimes and instruments within the songs. It would also be great to meditate to."
5,Tortoise - Chinese Feng Shui Music,"You can believe this music releases the energy associated with the element of water because it just flows from your player. From tinkling brooks to hidden mysterious streams to rushing torrents, what ever knots you have formed in your muscles during the day, dissolve in it's eglaic tones. At one point I felt convinced I was hearing the patter of rain outside , got up to check and realized it was still the CD. I practice Chen man Ching's yang style of Tai ji to this and the pacing and mood is excellent. It's wonderful for Qi Quong, for meditation, not intrusive and a definite aid to focusing your awareness, and you'll also think it's a soundtrack to a film you saw long ago..and always remembered."
4,First one didn't work - Second one did,"I bought this to add XM to my wife's stock GM radio. The first one didn't work, but the replacement works fine."
5,Pantine Green round salad plates,"I ordered these plates from Amazon to add to an existing set that was no longer available where I made the original purchase. The product was exactly as shown by Amazon. I liked the antiquing around the edges and that was the main reason for choosing this set. I purchased square dinner plates, round salad plates, and a combination of square and round soup/cereal bowls to make an interesting set. One of the salad plates was damaged when I received it and the replacement actually reached my home before I mailed the damaged pieces back. There was no charge to me by Amazon to mail it back since it arrived damaged. I simply printed out the return label and sent it off. I also ordered 12 coffee mugs to match, 3 of which arrived broken. The replacement process was painless and no charge to me. I had the new pieces in a few days and since they were prepackaged at the factory, I was sent 4 plates instead of 1 at no charge and 4 coffee mugs instead of 3."
2,Great idea...but come on! Ten minutes???,"I bought this $15 video as I LOVED Lucca, Italy. Truly one of the nicest places on Earth...but only found out as I started watching it....that it is only 10 MINUTES long! What a disappointment. The quality of the show is not that good and doesn't show the true beauty of Lucca. I would not recommend this video and plan on returning it....but come on, TEN MINUTES? What a joke!"
5,Waterlily,"I heard this record for the first time while getting acupuncture for very severe back-pain. I found this the most beautiful, relaxing music."
5,I really love this record,I was hanging out with a friend at a tavern in NYC and saw Chris perform live. I had never heard his music before and I was instantly hooked. The only way I can explain it is that his songs touch me. They make me feel warm. I wish there was more music like this on the radio.
4,Pleasantly Surprised,Got this from a friend.Knew he wrote songs.Strong album...Good material....GOOD BUY!
5,Buy this CD; it's a gem.,"Peter Maag - although not very well known - may well be the finest Mozart conductor living today. His performances of the ""Haffner"" (No. 35) and ""Linz"" (No. 36) Symphonies are superb. However, I have a special fondness for the delightful little Symphony No. 32. Although it lasts only about 13 minutes, it is a real gem - and you won't find a better performance of it than this one by Maag. If you like Mozart, you'll love this CD."
3,Elementary but good,Elementary but good . . . and older. Elementary but good . . . and older. Elementary but good . . . and older. Elementary but good . . . and older. How many more words do I have to add?
5,Outstanding Powerpoint reference,"Great book! Covers all the stuff about PowerPoint 2007 you could possibly want to know, and then some. I make professional presentations with PowerPoint for the photography classes I teach, and it was quite a challenge untill I got my copy of this great book. I use many sophisticated graphics and transitions in my presentations and I was able to quickly learn how using this reference book. I also synchronize slide shows to music using PowerPoint and the material in this book was invaluable in that endeavor. Highly reccomend it!"
5,Power Point for Dummies,"Excellent book, though does not discuss use of ctrl and alt shift, etc keys to center, move and orient text. Otherwise, I am amazed at how well it is written and what I am learning as a novice."
3,B Dickson memories,"This CD was ok, but in comparison to the Best of Barbara Dickson, was shorter and not really showcasing her talent."
2,Penny Wise and Pound Foolish.,"I was surprised that the unit was so fundamentally basic, in its design and use. This is ""bare-bones"", and ""no frills"" done to perfection. The coffee maker is made of very thin plastic, and the pins that hold the lid on are about 1/8"" thick. I do not think they would break unless they were twisted. The coffee maker failed to work after the 1st pot of coffee and I sent it back. I wouldn't even recommend it to send with your kid to college, because it's lack of a auto-shut off feature makes it a safety hazard. I really believe that Consumer Reports got it wrong by rating this so highly.Unless your after a ""no-frills"" coffeemaker, I would not recommend this pot. I have since purchased a 12 cup Cuisinart DCC-1200, which has more features, and is a quality product. It is worth the extra money."
4,Great Little Inexpensive Brewer,"I bought this coffeemaker a year and a half ago as a temporary solution before I invested $179 in the one I really wanted at the time. I needed it to last 6 mos, and after using this little gem for 18 mos, I wouldn't trade it now. It's so basic, no frills or bells/whistles, but it makes really great coffee - and this is coming from a coffee-snob. If you're looking for a simple and very inexpensive solution, this is it. It takes up little space on your counter, and is surprisingly stylish for the price. I paid $17.00, and would pay it again to buy another one of these when/if it stops working. I would have given it 5 stars if it were more sturdy - the parts are pretty flimsy - but it's still working great after 18 mos!"
5,Great for relaxation.,"As a Tai Chi student, I find this CD to be wonderful even though it's intended for the Chi Gong exerciser. It helps me to relax and meditate. There is only one track on the CD and it's almost 46 minutes long. You just can't jump from one song to the next but that's OK because once you start listening to this music you won't want to stop. The soothing melody relaxes you much like a Mozart or Brahms arrangement."
4,Meditation assistance,"This cd is wonderful. I am new to meditation and find the sounds/music relaxing and stress relieving by the second. I highly recommend this cd to others who, like me, are newbie's to the art."
4,Bought As a Gift,"I bought this for my girlfriends son, who loves toy cars/trucks and Superman. The toy is just what you would expect. It is simply your standard Hot Wheels truck, but slightly larger because it is a MONSTER TRUCK. Hot Wheels also makes this particular truck in different sizes (this is the small version), but from what I can tell it is an accurate replica of the real life Superman monster truck."
5,Works great!,I love that this stuff is non-toxic and I've used it for years! Its fantastic! And the seller was super fast on the shipping and the price was great. I was very pleased.
3,Works well but oily,"I bought this specifically to keep bees away. It does seem successful at that part for sure. It is only spf 30 so it's not amazing for sunscreen but again, as long as the bees and yellow jackets stay away, it's fine. It is particularly oily though. I put it on my face (again to keep the bees away) and I find that it feels greasy and i break out from it."
1,Not the correct product,"This product ended up being a $15 camera case. The seller, BestPriceCenter does not sell food. Make sure you order from a correct listing. The seller did agree to refund after I ship the product back."
3,An old friend!,"Back in the 60's when I was in college the receiving tube manual was almost required reference material. Tubes occupy a niche market now, but this reference is still relevant if you are interested in Guitar or HI-Fi tube amplifiers."
3,"Probably Great for Discus, but a Little Weak for Shot","This is one of the least expensive carriers out there and is probably fine for the discus and shots of 6 lbs or so. My son, however, bought one of these carriers last season and used it to carry an 8 and a 12 pound shot. By the end of the season, one of the pockets had ripped at the seam. In spite of this, I bought another one this season on account of the low cost and Prime shipping. I've asked him to be a little more careful with it."
2,Love Doris's books but these were not great.....,"I love Doris's books, really I do! That's why I was so disappointed to get this book and find most of the recipes are mediocre, at best. There isn't anything in this book that tastes like real, good, Mexican cooking. You can find better in many other books. I just cringe having to say this when I'm such a fan of Doris's other books, but her Mexican book and her Italian book just...rather suck. I've had so much better in other books. Save your money and maybe check this one out of the library to try a few recipes first, and see if I'm wrong. If you agree with me, then you aren't out any money. Sorry....this one just flat misses the boat on flavor and excitement. Bleh."
5,Good shirt for one use,"I actually use this now as an ""around the house"" shirt - comfy and holding up well."
3,Not what I thought..,"Don't get me wrong, I'll support Esham no matter what have since I heard him way back when. I was expecting it to me something like Tounges, I think it fell a little short.Where the heck was Mastamind on this? I just wish he'd go back to the older Esham or something simliar to Tounges. Hate to give it a 3 out of 5..."
2,"Green Book, Shangri-La, and Repentance","During the time of this LPs release... we all know what Psychopathic was up to. It was more personal music than anything. You can feel that when you listen to the LPs that came out during that era. Twiztid made Green Book. ICP made Shangri-La. Esham made Repentance.Esham goes off, but c'mon now it isn't ""Unholy"".So just know that this takes it in that direction if you are a new Juggalo.Don't get me wrong his oldschool stuff is scary. It has a lot of bass to it. So you can drive around really slow listening to it."
1,His Worst Album,"Esham has made a living off being an evil, explicit rapper that was 10x more controversial than anything eminem ever released. The extreme and often twisted philosophy on life was well represented in his previous albums. Now, however, he is not as aggressive on the mic anymore, the underground sound of the icp label sounds cheap in a bad way, not like the minimal beats and synthesizers found in Natas's ""Godlike."" He seems to take himself to seriously on this album, rapping about anti-war, and his true love relationship with his girlfriend. No longer is he a creative, funny, disturbing rapper like kool keith or edan. He has lost his edge and has delivered an album like any other mainstream rapper but not as well produced."
5,$42.51,Repentance by ESham (Audio CD - 2003) $42.51$42.51 really? Really?This another great album from Esham. I think $42.51 seems really low priced for this product. It should sell more around $420.
5,STILL THE BEST ARTIST TO COME OUT OF MICHIGAN,This album is the answer that so many fans were waiting for. They said he couldnt do it again but he did. Great album you'll love it. (look for his new album A 1 YOLA coming on feb 22).
1,thefunkhunter,"Esham has made a living off being an evil, explicit rapper that was 10x more controversial than anything eminem ever released.

5,Love these jellies,I love these jellies. I received flavors that I normally could not buy in a grocery store. Delicious!
5,Nothing Better,"We were dismayed to find that we couldn't get Trappist Preserves at the local grocery store. No problem, Amazon has it!!! If you've never had it, try it and you will love it. If you've had it, you know what I mean!! Great flavor selection too. Alot of other flavors are available (28 total), just do a ""Google"" on ""trappist preserve""."
1,"The secret word is ""dire""",I'm a big Pee-Wee Herman fan but this hits a particularly low nadir in his career. Its particularly dragged down by its cast of z-list has-beens and never weres giving dreadful cameos along with a significantly lower standard of production and a script guaranteed to squeeze out the last painful grimace you are capable of. Quite painful to watch really!
4,Magically ridiculous,"It's not typical TV jokes that make this video so funny. It's just how ridiculous the whole thing is. You don't have time to stop and think as Pee-Wee welcomes a bizarre array of guests from Magic Johnson to k.d. lang, as well as all the Playhouse regulars. Who knew Little Richard could skate? Why was someone mailing Grace Jones to the White House? (Ronald Reagan was celebrating his final Christmas in office when this came out.) Why is Frankie Avalon making Christmas cards with a potato?When Pee-Wee stops to point out the real meaning of Christmas, I was expecting a watered-down ""time for giving and sharing"" message, but he actually acknowledges the religious meaning. Talk about unexpected! So just forget about Pee-Wee's offscreen trouble, and enjoy the show."
4,Grandson into dinosaurs,Grandson in the dinosaur phase and enjoys watching these dvds. Better than watching cartoons and other questionable garbage on TV
4,Authentic and gripping,"The best part of this book comes not from the letters of Daniel Chisholm, but from Sgt. Samuel Clear, who was in the same Company as the Chisholm brothers were. His day to day entries during 1864-65 are the real deal. Pragmatic, prosaic and utterly without pretension, Sgt. Clear comes across as a decent and likable soldier.Think of this book as a 19th-century weblog followed by 19th-century emails and you'll see how life as a soldier hasn't changed much emotionally. Modern-day soldiers will nod their heads sympathetically reading these flashes from history."
1,Toshiba laptop battery,"The battery arrived OK. The battery was installed is it could get a full charge. There seemed to be a faint, warm plastic smell that was hard to pinpoint. A day later I was checking for warm spots on the laptop. Smoke started to come from the battery so I unplugged the laptop and took it out of the house. The battery started on fire. I managed to get it out of the laptop and put out the plastic fire. I decided to stop buying Toshiba laptop batteries. I will stop using the laptop as well. I'm thankful it didn't start on fire when I wasn't here."
3,not sure if im happy with the product or not.,it is hard to say if i am happy with the product or not. i am always hesitant to purchase certain things on the internet and a battery is an iffy thing. how do i know if it is a good or brand new one. as of right now if i unplug my laptop the battery only holds power for about three hours or so on battery so it seems to me that it does not have the juice my last battery had. I think that a new battery should have more hours on it than that. i can only hope that it is a fluke and i did receive a new battery and that is all of the time that it has. for now i will givaa mediocre review on the purchase.
4,Cordless Telephone Handset,"I tried to puchase this item from Pnasonic but it was no longer manufactured. I tried many other sites to in clude e-bay however [...] had it in stock. It is a refurbished unit but works just like new and performs like the original.[...] is highly recommeded if you are looking for very good quality, excellent service and reasonable prices."
1,Not Usable,"I purchased this unit assuming it would work with my base unit. The new handset doesn't work when the phone rings; must be a different frequency. In any case, it doesn't work."
4,Nice phone,"I've had this phone, set of four, for several years with no problem. Unfortunately one of them broke so I replaced it with this unit. The only problem I had is that took me a while that the base recognized the new unit, but nothing mayor. Now all four units work great."
1,DISATISFIED,"THE SITE SAID THE ITEM WAS IN STOCK, I ORDERED IT, THEN 6 OR 7 DAYS LATER, RECEIVE AN EMAIL ADVISING THE ITEM WAS NOT IN STOCK. MY CARD WAS CHARGED ON THE DAY I ORDERED THE ITEM, AND A WEEK LATER I AM TOLD I WILL BE ISSUED A CREDIT. I AM DISAPPOINTED IN THIS TYPE OF REPRESENTATION WHICH I DID NOT EXPECT FROM AN AMAZON REFERENCED SITE. IT MAKES ME QUESTION WHY AMAZON WOULD LET SUCH A FIRM SELL ON AMAZON. AS OF TODAY, I STILL AM NOT CREDITED THE MONEY ON MY CREDIT ACCOUNT. I WILL FIGHT THE CHARGES WHEN I GET MY STATEMENT IF IT IS NOT CLEARED UP BY THEN."
4,Good value,I recently added this handset as a third extension to my base unit. It was very easy to program and I am happy with the reception and clarity. Panasonic comes through with this one.
4,Good phone,"I have had no problems with our phones which I've had for about a year. They sound good, and we have expanded to 4 handsets. I made the right choice in selecting this system."
3,"Not Great, Not Bad","This is not a bad debut, over all. Certainly I've read better, but it holds its own all right. Unfortunately, the third book was a brave plunge that mostly failed. It takes a lot of balls to kill off a character who suddenly becomes likable, and I give Ms. Canavan credit for having the guts. But in execution it didn't work so hot.Perhaps because it was so sudden, or because you kind of saw it coming. Or because this newly likable character was involved with Sonea, the only really mildly likable heroine. Oh, she's far from the worst heroine I've read about, but far from the best, too.Actually, this series' ending reminded me of the ending of the anime Ceres: Celestial Legend, except not quite as poignant and moving.But it was a promising debut overall and hopefully Ms. Canavan will only go up from here."
4,Good book,"A good read but the follow up books seemed very expensive. Still, a good read. Very entertaining. Keeps moving. Not excessively detailed."
4,Entertaining Book,Pretty good book. I really like this series overall - the Black Magician Trilogy is a simple and fast read but entertaining.
5,Wow. what a trip into a fantasy world!,"I was hooked on the story almost from the first sentence and I thouroughly enjoyed this book.(Actually, this applies to all three books in the Trilogy.) Trudi kept the action moving and kept adding surprise twists to the plot throughout..including the Epilogue!All of the varied major characters were well introduced and their individual stories wove well into a complex and complicated plot. I found myself quickly involved emotionally with almost all of them, both the heroes and the villans. I loved it! It's a good thing I purchased the entire trilogy at the same time as waiting for the second and third books to arrive via second order would have felt like forever! An excellent author and I look forward to seeing more of her work soon."
3,"Hey, where did the end go!",I liked the book but the ending was a disepointment. The good guys won but what happend next? Didn't the auther bother to wright more. I actually think this book as incomplete. The book has some other flaws but not as anying as the end. It's a thrilling read and the whole trilogy is very good.I recommend this triogy to all my friends but warn them of some booring sideplots and the end is cut to short.
4,Great adventure!!,"I have to say, I adored this series. The world created by Trudi is believed and full of life and death. You can't help but fall for the characters and cheer them on at every turn. The magic system she has in place is both believed and vivid. I know I have enjoyed this series immensely and plan to keep on reading whatever she releases."
4,The High Lord,I really enjoyed the book and it arrived quickly and in excellent condition. I was really happy with this provider and would definately buy from them again.
2,Horrid ending - don't kill off the hero!!,"I loved this book up until the ending chapters, and then when the hero was killed, I hated it. What a disappointment, and so unnecessary if the author had used a bit more writing skill. What a pathetic conclusion to a promising trilogy. I will never read any other books by this author again."
2,Ick,"I can't imagine what is possessing people to say they love this book. It's really very amateurishly written and clunking. The prose is silly and the plot thunks along, unlike better written fantasy, which sings. I will not choose a book from Amazon reviews again; all I can imainge is that the reviewers all have bad taste or they are all the author's friends."
3,Ended like the middle of a series.,"As many other reviews have stated, this final book ended leaving far far too many loose ends. It feels as if it is book three in what should be a 5 or 6 book series instead of trilogy."
2,Too slow,"The plot of this book wasn't too bad-- it wasn't unique but it wasn't bad. However, the plot moved so slowly it wasn't until the last two or three chapters of each book that things finally started to happen. There was a book's worth of preparation for a few page's worth of hasty plot. There were many times I just wanted to quit reading. This three-book trilogy could have easily (and probably for the better) been condensed to one book."
2,blah!,"***If you didn't read the book yet DON'T READ THIS***Ok I like the first two books. The main character was strong and cool, but this book was the awful. It gets annoyingly boring around the middle so the author thought to liven things up with a relationship...big mistake. Now that she has a boyfriend forget being strong and smart, he does all the work.The ending was the worst disappointment, I'm not angry he died but its how he died. And at the very end she's so happy like ""oh its ok he's dead, I'm pregnant with his child."" That quote is not from the book in case you didn't notice but that's the general feeling. That's messed up!"
3,The High King got a Low Ending,"I finished this book a couple of months ago and just never got around to writing a review for it.I thought that the trilogy as a whole was great. Good action, riveting suspense, romance (but not too much romance) and some really great character development throughout the entire series.But I did find this final book a bit anti-climactic. I was hoping for a big Magic battle at the end with Magicians doing things that had never been done before and showing their power, but it just didn't happen. I still liked it, though.I would recommend the series, it just didn't finish like a bang, as I was hoping."
3,A Trilogy With Just Three Books,"While Ms Canavan's Black Magician Trilogy is not, by any means, a highly original or even a very well developed work, it does hold a few rewards for its readers. Action does not end in this series, it is just paused for a snack and restroom break, then the characters are back at it again, slinging magic at each other like four year olds in a mud fight. If nothing else this series would make good airplane or hotel room reading, and you can rest easy in the knowledge that this trilogy, unlike some that have been released in recent history, actually ends with the third book. It culminates. It brings itself to a conclusion. This is truly a phenomenon in this age of Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind, and I think Ms Canavan should be commended for staying true to her purpose and completing the story she started in the advertised number of volumes."
3,Disappointing ending,"The Trilogy was certianly good, the story kept me engrossed until the end. But thats where the trouble started, there was so much build up and history yet the final fight is incredibly brief and uninteresting. The ending ties up very few things with the exception of Ambassador Dannyl, they all left on annoying hangings that left you unsure of even what state the country and guild were in or where they were headed."
5,This series of books is very good.,I really like this series of books. It was interesting and original. The characters have depth and their was an interesting story line with one or two plot twist. I highly recommend this series
3,Ne!,"""Ne Mosquitos Pass"", ""Most at Home at Motels"" (sounds like parts of the Gap are on this tune) , ""My Cause is Noble and Just"" and ""What if We Aren't After All, All Destined For Greatness"" are solid. The tracks aren't as cool as songs from the other albums except for ""Ne"" or ""Greatness"". Otherwise...it's kind of meh after one listen. The kid singing songs is a little too biazarre, I agree. It must be a tape Tim found at a rummage sale or thrift store. Ha. A good juxtaposition nevertheless. Or the kid could be Tim's son like another reviewer said.Don't let the classic song titles fool you! I'll Show You, I'll Show You All!"
4,A sonic bubble bath on a cold lonely night,"For a low budget indy release I enjoy this soothing, soulful music. This is a nice little gem to listen to when you want to dim down the lights, lay down on the couch to get away from the korean eat dog world, and seep out the stress in your life through relaxing & positive music. Mark Redding is no Bret Michaels on vocals but he makes up for it with poetic lyrics and feeling. I also think Amazon.com hit the nail on the head when stating ""customers interested in HEAL may also be interested in 70% off London hotels"" Wow....I never thought of it like that.............NoahComic Book Store owner & incoherent rambler"
1,Not one of the best...,"I dissapointed in quality of album, songs too modern, not tradition enough. For real fan of chinese classical, sound not enough Chinese!!! Much song too westernized. You should like to try album of the title ""Rain Dropping On The Banana Tree"". It has the old songs actually record in old time, not much western influence, is more traditional opera and chamber music. Earliest date for song recorded on that album is 1903!!!!..."
4,good Chinese music,"very traditional chinese music. If not a fan of the genre, maybe hard to listen to. I am a fan and enjoy this album when trying to relax or don't want to listen to my ""typical"" music."
2,Not relaxing at all,"I was looking for relaxing, soothing Chinese music and this was not it. Maybe one or two songs were but the rest were not. There were drum rolls, screeching and annoyingly increasing crescendo.Now I am not a music expert (certainly not Chinese music), and this CD may well be traditional music. Then it was not what I was looking for. I was looking for relaxing music that I have heard in the background of Tai Chi and Chi Gong DVD's. I love the sound of the Chinese violin (erdu or huquin??). I should have looked to those sources and purchased their soundtracks. This music reminded too much of a street show with dragons or a 1920 operatic performance. The only missing element was the unusually unique singing.In summary, this is not for relaxation. This is possibly the first time that I was fooled by other reviewers on Amazon as well. However, this music might actually be traditional music."
4,Excellent compilation,"I ordered this album to play while practicing TaiChi and QiGong, and found it quite appropriate for the moment. It is rather accessible, as some know it is not always easy to relate to the eastern culture. I felt transported to another world and time. I would definitely recommend it."
5,Good Product,"I am in my mid 40's and I have waist length, thick, naturally curly hair that usually frizzes instead of curls. It usually takes over an hour to tame my hair into something manageable. I purchased this product with the knowledge that a 2"" barrel will not curl as much as it smooths. It worked beautifully for this. I was able to smooth my hair in less than half the time of a flat iron (and without burning myself) and curling iron combination. What this product gave me was soft, smooth, shiny waves that that feel so touchable soft. I hope this review helps you make your decision."
5,Great product,"This is great for long, thick hair. I have thick, asian hair and it is a pain to blow dry. So, i blow dry somewhat carelessly and then I use this curling iron and it looks like a salon blow out. it takes much less time. not real curl, just a nice bend and a nice shine. get it, but dont expect curl"
5,Love it!,"When it arrived, I was shocked at how big around it was but after using it, I have fallen in love! It straightens as it curls. The curl is very subtle. I like being able to adjust the temperature. I would definitely recommend this curling iron."
2,It Depends What You Need.,"If you want curl, please do not buy this item. If you want a straight kind of styled look, this might be for you. This ""curling"" iron is really a monster. I was hoping for some bigger volume curls but it didn't turn out so well. I really would suggest going smaller. You can use it to get a pretty cool straight look but that's not personally what I needed. So it really does depend what you are looking for."
2,Hot Tools - Return,"The Supertool 2"" curling iron arrived timely, a quality product, but the barrel was too large for my daughter's shorter hair style. I had to figure out how to make a return and the vendor Lamerchendise was very accommodating. Lamerchendise replied to my emails promptly with specific directions and waived a portion of their restocking fee. As long as I receive the refund through Amazon appropriately I would purchase again in the future."
4,happy,"This works just like I want. It does all that is expected... burned once though, not sure I can blame product... =s"
5,Perfect for a round brush effect,I love the way my hair looks when it's been blown out with a round brush but it's so much work to do. This curling iron gives me the soft bend at the ends and takes so little effort. I love this curling iron!
3,Too big and not dual voltage,"The 2"" diameter is also too large for the length of my hair. Although it is well past the shoulders, it does not reach the bra strap line at my back. The result is the ends are curled but my hair is just not long enough to spiral or curl more than once. I have used the highest setting and the curl only lasts about an hour or 2 despite hairspray, perhaps due to humidity.Not good for travel since this only works on 110v sockets."
5,Quick and HOT,"I really liked this product after I returned a curling iron with no clamp for my hair (beware I didn't know they made irons with no clamp). I have long, thick, wavy layered hair and need the heat and the clamp, and I love the huge barrell it really softens of the look and takes the frizz out."
2,"great look, but doesn't last, especially for thick hair","after i use it on my hair, it looks amazing, but i have naturally straight and very thick hair, so after about an hour, it goes flat. i use hair spray so it's not that. if you have the same problem, get a ceramic iron , not this one"
2,Love hot tools curling irons...until....,I have 2 other hot tools curling irons and use them at least 3 days a week. I love them because my fine straight hair actually holds a curl with these irons. Unfortunately the first time I turned this curling iron on to use it the gold started PEELING OFF! I didn't even know that this was possible! I'm not really sure if the major chunks of metal showing through will damage my hair or not...but I'm just completely shocked that the gold peeled off. Maybe I just got a defective one...never had these problems with hot tools before.
5,prof!,"i got it , i tried it, i loved it !honestly girls, it will do beautiful waves and curls for your (long) hair.Don't order this if your hair is short or medium becoz it will curl the very ends of your hair only.I love it and i appreciate my long hair even more and more now ."
3,Great while it lasted,"First thing: this iron does not have an auto-off switch! I assumed it did since all of my other ones do and it got so hot through the day when I forgot to turn it off that it burned through its own wire and the countertop. Technically that was my fault, but almost all other brands have the shutoff, it's bad that this one doesn't.After about one year of great use, the hinge and clamp were no longer tightly closing anyway. It made curling so frustrating. The look it gives when working is great, but check out other 2-inch irons first. Most of my other tools last a few years."
4,HUGE curling iron,This thing is huge. I love the heat settings on this . For people with thick hair I feel it works really well.
1,not pleased.,"When I ordered this, I knew that it would not create curls, but I did expect it to put curl or volume in my hair none the less. When I first tried to curl my hair, it came out straight and looking as though I had not done anything to it. I spend about an hour curling my hair in different ways hoping to see some sort of curl to it, but I saw nothing. I, who is usually pleased with anything done to my hair, was completely unsatisfied and I will be returning the curling iron. If you are hoping to see big curls, or any curls in that matter, do not get this iron."
1,Disappointed with Hot Tools Curling Iron,"""Hot Tools"" was recommended to me by my hair stylist, however it stopped working after one use!"
3,Not seeing curls yet...,"I've tried this 2'' iron a couple times now, and I'm still not seeing curls. Maybe the barrel is too wide? I have long hair so I thought the 2'' would work well...maybe not? I have the 1 1/4'' one, and I love that one. I gave it 3 stars because I still like Hot Tool Professional products.I will give this 2'' iron another shot. There's a GOOD chance I don't know the correct way to curl hair haha so I will see if I can get this to work another time ;)"
1,Doesn't curl my hair...,I tried using this curling iron several times and it didn't curl my hair at all... I have thick hair so I even tried taking it in really small sections and nothing... Maybe I'm doing something wrong but I got zero results with this.
2,It should be called a straightener.,"I have long, curly hair all the way to my waist and I was looking for something to give me beachy waves that a 1"" curler does not. I guess I can't say that it is a bad curler but it definitely does not make curls, it simply straightens hair and makes it curl out or in at the bottom. I switched to the 1.5 inch, however, and it worked exactly how I wanted to. This one was just TOO big!"
2,"Curls fine, but falls apart","When this curling iron came with extra springs, I should have known what was coming. I used it twice and the spring tweaked and wouldn't roll correctly, I have replaced both springs it came with and it did the same thing, so now I have to push on the thing to get it to close around my hair everytime I use it. I would not recommend this product to anyone and am now buying a new iron from a different manufacturer."
2,Not the biggest fan,"I tried it out for the first time, cranking it to its highest heat setting and allowing it to heat up for 10 mins before use. I have decently thick hair and its long as well, i sectioned my hair into smaller portions and began curling, it did nothing for my hair except flipped the ends slightly. I washed my hair the day before so it couldnt have been that. im very disappointed"
1,Short lifespan ...,"I have been a fan of Hot Tools products for many years because of their durability. Hot Tools curling irons typically give me 5+ years of use. But this 2"" Curling Iron stopped working after 13 months! I bought this from Amazon seller, Housewares. I am completely disappointed and will not purchase any future products from this seller."
2,"Sadly, it broke","I was really disapointed with the quality. It worked absolutely fantastic for about 3 months. Then, all of a sudden, it stopped heating,, and became completely useless!"
5,Happy customer and child!,"I was so excited to get this book shortly after ordering it. This was a childhood book of mine and I couldn't wait to read it to my son! It was worn, but from 1975 in really great condition."
1,If it doesn't have Yes's logo don't buy it,Be warned this is not a band endorced release it is merely a condensed version of the live House of Yes double CD
4,Great Kids Movie,"This is a great movie about triumph over almost impossible odds, and loyalty.I loved watching this when I was young, and was so glad to see it out on video!"
3,A good Movie,This was a good movie with a fair cast. The plot was well done and the effects were excellent. See it for your self
2,Beneath the Glotz,"The story, or rather the spirit beneath the schlocky presentation of SOLARBABIES is rather wonderful. It must be veiwed in terms of its symbolism. The kids are not following a glowing ball, they are following an ideal, a higher consciousness that we all possess if we can only find it. The water represents a sacred nourishment that comes from the depths of the cosmos. Most of us have forgotten how to access that nourishment, most of us have lost sight of that 'sphere of light'. It's unfortunate that even the movie's director did not understand these meanings, nor did the producers nor the more famous, and over-paid of the two writers. Consequently they all worked too hard to create another B-science fiction movie. This movie could have been a classic."
2,Solarbabies - The Good and the Bad,Good news about Solarbabies - it has its points!Bad news about Solarbabies - so does a rabid porcupine!
1,"Can I get a ""what the?!""",Let me explain the situation. We have here young orphan kids who roller blade around trying to bring down a corporation with the help of a glowing ball. Sound familiar? Probably not. I would say that nothing in the galaxy compares to the sheer stupidity of such a concept. Recomendation? I have none. I have decided that slamming one's head into a brick wall would be more logical then this film.
2,Don't bother,"The premise has seen better days, and lots of them. It's a post-apocalyptic world, a Mad Maxian place that trades in water rather than fuel, with a giant evil corporation thrown in for fun. The major dramatice tension comes from two teen gangs, one (the bad guys) associated with EvilCorp. And, when not pressed into near-slavery, they seem to get around on roller skates with headlights. Why there are skatable roads back and forth across the desert, so conveniently paved, cleared, and maintained, is beyond me, but there it is. Including that one straight into the secret domain of the goodguy Eco-whoozis. Oh, and the evil scientist - can't forget the evil scientist.Utterly forgettable. In fact, you could save yourself the effort of having to forget it by simply missing it in the first place. I should have.-- wiredweird"
5,Flash back to the 80's with a good fammily flick,"This is a classic 80's flick with all the ""new"" specia effects of those days. it was a wounderful story of friendship, hope, and determination.it takes place in the future , when the rains have stopped and water is scares. the army rules and homeless and parentless children are sent to camps more like prisons.through in your usual bad guys, vs good guys, add an alien and boom, an instant cult classic. if this is your first time seeing it you may think its an over done story with the save the water thing, but this is probably the one that started all the others since then. its still a most enjoyable flick and safe for the hole family."
5,Great 80s Movie!,One of the great movies of the 80s ... how could you beat a action packed feel good movies from the 80s!!!!
3,Not So Much...,"I bought this movie without ever seeing it thinking that i would love it because i am a huge fan of silly 80's movies, however i was sadly dissapointed. The plot sounded cute but in the end nothing really happened. I was left confused and frustrated. And i just couldnt get over the fact that there were roads you could roller skate on throughout the entire desert... I mean seriously people... So even for a silly 80's flick this was dissapointing...Woe is me..."
3,CAMPY AND REALLY FUN TO WATCH EIGHTIES MOVIE,"DON'T BOTHER TO TAKE SERIOUSLY THIS ATTEMPT OF BROOKSFILMS OF DOING SOMETHING COMMERCIAL. I HAVE TO SAY THAT BACK IN THE 80'S I DIDN'T LIKE SO MUCH THE MOVIE COMPARED TO OTHER TITLES OF THAT TIME LIKE -THE LOST BOYS, ETC- BUT WITH THE PAST OF TIME, I'VE REALIZED THAT THIS LITTLE TOY IS VERY ENTERTAINING AND DESSERVES A SECOND REVISION. NOT TO MENTION THE VERY TALENTED AND BEAUTIFUL CAST OF UPCOMING YOUNG STARS THAT CONTAINS.FRANKLY, LOTS OF TODAY MOVIES ARE MUCH MORE ABSURD AND RIDICULOUS THAN YOU CAN THINK THAT THIS ONE IS."
3,"Pleasant, but not very exciting","I have to start out by saying that I am a huge Barbra fan and have been all of my life. Having acknowleged that, I have to say that I was disappointed with this CD. I wasn't in love with ""A Love Like Ours"" or the newer Chrismas CD at first listen, but got to really like them. But this CD seems to be full of really dull, over-orchestrated material. I have to say that I do like ""Smile"" and I think that ""Calling You"" is really haunting and interesting and I was glad to see her try something different like that. I think she sounds GREAT, but overall the material is a snooze."
5,Miss Streisand Just Keeps Getting Better!!!,"I have all of Barbra's albums, cassettes and CD's. The woman is obviously THE BEST FEMALE SINGER of all time. She has had this idea for an album for a while and I am so glad it finally came out. Only she can do what she wants and still get away with it. She doesn't have to put out an album just because it is commercially correct. And those of you who are looking for the ""old Barbra"" (which is getting ""old"") need to appreciate her previous albums and respect her for moving on into the future and let her do what she does best. I get irritated when ANYONE could have the audacity to criticize her talent. It makes me wanna take Prozac and swim in a vat of honey....Barbra Streisand proves once again that....""Nothing's Improssible!!!"" Thanks!"
2,Oy! Give it a rest!,"If you worship Babs, you'll love this album. For the rest of us, Streisand is in better voice than usual but this disc is like buttah: bland. Every note that comes out of her mouth is self-concious and overwrought. Tempos are taken at dirge pace. Things are so tasteful they are boring. Hopes for an album comprable (or even close) to the Broadway Album are dashed. It's a shame because pre-Jon Peters Streisand was a mighty force. And a great singer."
1,what is she thinking?,"As a big fan of Streisands early work,I become more and more irritated with the direction she seems to have chosen to take of late.This album was a gift from a friend who knows of my early passion...God..What a mistake!Of all the songs available to her , why on earth did she choose such obscure and mostly DULL songs?...Perhaps she ,in her increasing self idulgence,felt that she alone could ellevate them into something better....WRONG.!Her determination to offer virtually nothing in variety or entertainment value leaves me with the feeling I,ve overdosed on prozac and I,m swimming in a vat of honey."
4,Calling you...,"Coming in a package that most certainly proofs to young artists how to sell a CD nowadays, one is already excited to stick ""The Movie Album"" - CD of Barbra Streisand in the player... and with the first notes rising from your speakers you just know it: Something extraordinary is about to happen. And while the excitement grows with every note, you just don't want this CD to end. And when it does end after more than 50 minutes of pure joy ... you just can't help it - you have to listen to it all over again... and again... and again."
1,Bland album,"Barbra shows how much of an old hag she has become on this album. It's worth buying just to complete the collection I suppose, but what a sad chronicle of the deterioration of a once great singer. This album is a big old yawn. Only buy it if you have no taste or have blue hair or both."
3,Not quite,There aren't as many screws as shown in the picture and they are all pretty much the same size. I needed smaller screws and they weren't there.
2,"housewife,mother, retired RN","I was very happy with the product. It's very expensive , though. I ended up finding the same thing for about $2 at Wal-Mart."
3,expecting a DVD,"I think it may have been my own fault, maybe I didn't look at the description close enough. But was dissappointed when I saw a VHS in the box."
5,"solid, eclectic, and elegant","this is a wonderfully wide-ranging collection that I find myself listening to again and again. you needn't be a chicagoan, or an ex-chicagoan (like myself) to appreciate the gems on the disc. this is hands down one of the strongest jazz compilations that i've heard."
1,"not good, disappointing","This one, well, I love jazz, but this one isn't good. I gave it as a present and was embarrassed about how it sounded. I went into it blindly and won't do that again."
1,This Product Does Not Work!,This rug tape does not work at all. It barely sticks to the back of a small area rug and doesn't stick to the floor at all. The rug slips and skids around just as much as it did without it!
3,The Bad Guys,Decent book about stage coach and train robbers...Not super academic...Has some good stories....Has some cool pictures...
5,Amazing and relaxing,I just stumbled on to this CD being a big Ozric Tentacles fan.This is amazing if you like spacey layered synthesizer music. Most tracks have a soothing feeling to them. I turn this on at work if I'm stressed out. It has the compositional flair and complexity that the Ozrics have without the intense guitar.
4,This is the way forward.,"After a few releases of great analog-wrecked noise madness and harsh reality, Black Dice have uncorked something incredibly fresh and welcome.This is where Morton Subotnick gets to hash it out with Boards of Canada.Really astonishing record, this. Timeless. And new. One of the 2-3 best things to happen in music this year if not the decade. It's a giant leap ahead of their peers into a new genre. Beaches and Canyons is endlessly more fascinating to listen to than any electroclash triphop drum'n'bass glitch postrock trance jungle techno you've heard. Plus it rocks more and surprises more than anything from those genres I am aware of. Too excellent. Wait no longer.As highly recommended: Creature Comforts."
4,cloud comforts for pleasing creatures,"WithBeaches & Canyons, the Black Dice unfold and explore strange, expansive psycho-acoustic territories, assembling an expedition into absorbing, multi-dimensional soundscapes. Creature Comforts isn't so sweeping, and establishes atmospheres on a different scale. It's almost as if, having charted a wide sonic wilderness, the Black Dice now seek to survey it's inhabitants...Creature Comforts suggests the speakers-static of curious arcades and carnivals after hours, after everyone has gone home and the batteries begin to die, the lights flicker and fade, the trash stirs in the vacant paveways, and the creatures come out: forgotten notes, looping truncated melodies, lazy leftover rhythms, gremlin glitches and meandering dissonances. Their peculiar prowling creates something like an incidental music, happenstance yet almost orchestrated, unassuming yet engulfing..."
3,Noise rock in a childrens workshop,"Black Dice must've taken cues from Japanese noise-rock bands, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. There's no denying what you'll get with 'Creature Comforts', noise, and alot of it, everything from quirky, analog, thrashing and everything in between. Generally much in the same vein as their Samurai peers Melt Banana, Merzbow and The Boredoms. Throw in a bit of the erratic experimentalism of Faust, Autechre's futuristic techno blasts, and Gastr Del Sol's post-rock noodlings, and you'll have Black Dice's brand of instrumental sonic meandering. This type of thing is an acquired taste, and to the uninitiated ear, this might sound as foreign as the alien-soundscapes this CD could be a backdrop to. But to fans of noise-rock, a challenge to listen to, a satisfying listen."
2,not that useful for shopping,"Has some interesting background information about anime/manga but it is simply not that useful for shopping.First, any guide to Japan NEEDS to have the Japanese name of the store.It is simply impossible to match up anything without this as the English equivalent is often not found, especially if you're going to ask someone about where a store is.Second, there are quite a few places missing, especially of interest to any female anime fans out there. There is no mention of Ikebukuro at all, which is known as somewhat of the female equivalent to Akihabara.And the NHK Studio Park is also missing which would be of interest to fans of Domo-kun and other NHK shows."
1,Don't waste your money,The book is useless. All illustrations in black and white.Buy Photoshop Elements Solutions instead.
5,Excellent BEGINNERS book!,"Best of the bunch coverage of basic photo techniques, computer and device color management, and cool stuff in Elements!!!"
2,Save Your Money,The first third of thid book covers capturing digital images. The last 2 thirds mimic the manual that comes with the software. This is a typical computer users manual full of fluff and not much substance. Sorry but I took the book back to the store. So I would suggest looking around for a better book then this one.
3,Wasted Money,"Wasted money ( Chuck Peterson - retired Professional Photographer 10/25/01 )I was very disappointed with this book. I was hopping for something more than the ""USER GUIDE'"" supplied with Adobe Photpshop Elements software. Why buy something you get for free only written with slightly different words and with black and white illustrations ( 8 pages of color inserted between pages 180 and 181). I should have waited for a book written by a photographer not a R&D engineer. I totally agree with the books rating on the back cover - user level ""Beginners"""
2,"Some good info, but poorly organized, and written.","It is difficult to find a well-written, well-organized book on computer software. To many of the writers well, can't write-- both on the macro level (they can't organize a book in a way that matches how people learn and use software) or the micro level (poorly constructed sentences, pointless paragraphs, bizarre ""cute"" asides). Lisa Lee is not the worst offender, but this book doesn't exactly escape the stereotype either. The book is not written in a user friendly way (i.e. starting with the most basic, important uses of photo editing and moving on to weirder stuff). Instead, it goes feature by feature (with little sense of priority) through the software, like a manual. I'm hoping other Elements books are better.(...)"
1,This isn't hip hop music,"I don't understand why reggaeton artists think their music is profound and true hip hop. Reggaeton music is not a culture. Reggae and true dancehall music is a culture and those artist make music for everyone to listen to. If artists like Tego Calderon and Daddy Yankee want to put out music for everyone to hear. At least put out material in english y'all. Also, I've been labled a ""Reggaeton Hater"" just because I'm voicing my opinion on the genre of music. All I got to say to those people is, you guys don't know what the hell you're talking about."
4,Aguanta Que LLego Grandpa,"The most underated artist in the genre--the black horse of the movement. But behind the scenes everyone knows who the godfather is--a REAL hip hop artist making great music. With all the real Puerto Rican flava and some lyrics that you wouldn't understand unless you lived on the island. 100 % Criollo ---el Abayarde reminds us of what being Boricua means--It won't be easy for him to crossvoer like DY, and most people outside of PR may not understand what the hell he's talking about. But he is reaching the people he is targeting. Not for everyone but true boricuas will enjoy it."
3,COMPRALO SI TE GUSTAN LAS CAFRERIAS...,"EN VERDAD EL DISCO NO ES TAN MALO, PERO TAN POCO ES TAN BUENO, TODAS LAS CANCIONES SON IGUALES Y LLEGA EL MOMENTO QUE TE ABURRES."
2,It's not that good as everyone says,"This album was k, defenetly not one of the best. Everybody seems to be recommend it, I defenetly do not. I am a big fan of reggaeton, this album did not provide me with the beats and the lyrics I was looking for. It is more for the spanish hip hop goers. Out of all my latin reggaeton CD's, this is the one I least listen to. The only one true song i like is Al Natural with Yandel."
4,"Liked it.......but then, I like all of His books.","Actually,the book was a compilation of articles that have appeared in Sucessfull Farming magazine over the years. His books are always funny to those who understand life on the farm and tractor restoration."
5,Gummy Grand Champion!,"Best darn gummies on the planet! No goofy colors/flavors.The Japanese gummies by Kasugai are a close second, but they're also crazy expensive (~3-4 times as much as Dare's!). Don't even get me started on the chemically tasting, filling destroying, relationship wrecking Haribo junk. ;)EP"
5,Excellent Discovery Guide Book,A wonderful guide to places to see & things to do when you want to hop to a nearby area but aren't familiar with it. Takes you off the beaten path to discover interesting-curious-historical places not mentioned on the chamber websites. Offers succinct descriptions to evaluate the fit such a visit is for you and your family.
3,not riot by candlelight,"like the title says,this is not riot by candlelight but it's understandable.he even explains why he switched up his subject matter in the album's intro.this album took a few listens to get use to,but it grew on me.the production isn't as good as riot but it does has its moments.plus you kinda get the feelin' that sleep was trying suntin' different.all in all,it's a solid release.i give it 3.5 stars just cause i like sleep's style.stand out track is ""so tired""."
5,BEWARE!,"Please be aware that there are two versions of this CD--both contain different songs. One CD has a blue-purple color and a cartoonish image of Ella on the cover. There is also a version with a picture of the real Ella on it.Both of these CDs have the same title, but different track listings. For example, the ""Gold"" with the real Ella on it does not include songs such as ""Manhattan"" or ""Bewitched"". I was really disappointed when I received my CD and it didn't have these songs on it, because they were the main reason I bought it.The songs are still 5-star material, though...just not what the product description states, nor other reviews on this page."
3,Sorbee Sugar-Free Strawberry Syrup,"My daughter drinks a lot of strawberry milk and none of the stores in our area carry Hershey's Strawberry Sugar Free Syrup, which we used/purchased in South Carolina. It tastes okay when mixed with milk, but not so good over ice cream or as a dip for apples."
1,Terrible,I bought this for my Ihop pancakes. This did not taste anything like strawberry. You are better of getting some smuckers sugarfree ice cream topping that is great.
5,Do you have sore joints/muscles?,I have injured both of my knees. This is the only product that really helps. It is wonderful. I have shared it with my family. We are all hooked.
3,Simple Book,I thought this book was a little too simple for what I was looking for. Narcissism is more complex than this book reviews and can take non-overt forms.I wanted a more in depth eval but this is a good start for someone wanting the basic information.
2,Who's The Dummy?,These books are not written for dummies. I got more information from the 'help' in the Access program. CoMpLeTe waste of $$ and time. Let me help write the next book that the common person can understand.
3,This Works,"So much to understand, so few neurons to work with. With persistence and continuous reference, you can get it done."
2,Steeleye Span meets the loudness war,"Yes, they did it again. Besides pushing every frequency range to the limits, they managed to actually cripple the songs with over 200 clipped samples on disc 1 and over 900 on disc 2. This happens when the sound levels go beyond the limits of the audio CD specifications and parts of the sound wave are ""cut off"" - or, in other words, the waveform literally flatlines and any sound at those points is simply lost. Even in the parts where clipping does not occur, the absurd raising of the sound levels results in some very uncomfortable listening. All instruments and vocals have had their volumes raised to the same high levels, resulting in a complete loss of the dynamics of the songs, with instruments that were originally very quiet now sounding as loud as everything else. Why can't these audio ""engineers"" go work in some other field more adequate to their abilities like dog walking or whatever, thus avoiding criminally maiming classic, essential music like this?"
2,Not worth it if you already have the older CDs,"If you happen to like the way recordings are ""remastered"" these days, rendering them loud messes of sound that obscure the subtleties of the music, then you'll love these remasters. But if you think that louder does not equal better, and if you have the older CD issues, then just stick with them. I ended up keeping my old CDs of these albums and giving this set to a friend (who loved it, by the way, so what do I know?)."
2,"Easy, kid friendly fair","This cookbook does contain some fun, easy recipes. It is very kid friendly! We were disappointed to discover how many blank pages there are in it. It has pages for you to copy recipes to give to friends - which is a fun idea. We felt that with as many pages as there are in the book it would have more recipes and more photographes...not blank pages. It does come with a stencil to create a cute Westie of your own. The cookbook does feature nice photographs and few recipes for healthy fair."
5,"Mozart's letters, Mozart's Life",a great book for all lovers of Mozart's music and those who have an interest in his amazing life. It's well written and easy to read.
3,Didn't Get Excited,"This cookie has a thin graham crust with a slim layer of raspberry topped with a lot of marshmallow and covered entirely in dark chocolate. If these ingredients work well for you, you will love this cookie. I was hoping it would have more raspberry and less marshmallow but that wasn't the case...I could only give it a 3 star."
4,very addictive,"I recently disovered the wonders of Accuradio and, in particular, the station TWANG. It is awesome. There are a few CD's that are in heavy rotation other than Johnny Cash or Willie Nelson. This is one of them, and for good reason. It sounds new and old, and Wayne's voice does have an uncanny resemblance to a certain Hank Williams. The music has this quality that you rarely hear of being familiar and completely unique at the same time. Hat's off to the band for making it sound oh so easy. It's toe tapping heaven."
2,Not worth the price,"This was a cute video but not worth the price. The exercises are moved through too fast to feel effective, especially the neurolymphatic massage portion. For over $20, there is less than 5 minutes of daily routine, and just a few minutes on other tracks explaining some of the routines. I wanted something that would keep me from meandering through the 5 minute energy routine that takes me longer than 5 minutes--but this was just too fast.If the price were lower, it would be worth it. But I expected more for over 20 dollars."
5,Laughed Out Loud,"A wonderful, witty story of a single mother facing and conquering numerous challenges. Muller proves that a woman can have a successful career and a successful family life. It's been a long time since I laughed out loud like I did when I read this book. Bravo!"
1,SUCKS.,"After using this on my newborn for no more than 3 times (no joke), the metal pin popped out and the top part flew off. The metal pin is somewhere buried in my couch and i'm left with a non-functioning nail clipper. Maybe it was meant to be....my baby hates getting her nails cut! But, i expected a lot more from Tweezerman products.Still looking for a good pair of baby clippers to deal with her claws."
2,Cut poorly and more difficult to hold than other baby nail clippers,"I'm a big fan of other Tweezerman products, but these clippers left me disappointed. My pair cuts poorly -- leaving a sharp, somewhat crushed nail edge. The smooth plastic handles that have been added are more difficult to grip than other baby nail clippers I've tried, and the metal clipper often slides out as I'm trying to maneuver them. For those who care, there is a large label on the bottom that reads ""CHINA."" I thought perhaps that all baby nail clippers were the same, until I tried the Summer Infant ""Dr Mom Nail Clipper Set"" (I can't find it on Amazon, but one of the major big-box baby stores carries it). That one has a large, easy-to grip loop handle and nice rubber accents that allow for a reassuringly stable grip, and it clips the nails cleanly and easily."
5,Perfect Nail Clippers,Perfect size to clip little bitty fingernails. Sharp enough so you can do what you need to do in one clip. Highly recommend.
2,sharp but...,"The nail cutter is sharper than other kinds I bought before & it's cuter too. However, I might be unlucky as right on the first use, the cutter was broken! I returned it & got full refund from Amazon. I'm happy though!"
1,Cute but didn't do a good job,"This nail clipper is very cute, easy to hold, and the included nail filer is very useful, too. However it does not do a good job to cut my newborn's thin finger nails. Many times I have to pull a little get the unfinished part off after making one cut! Plus it's kind of pricey comparing the job done. Not worth the money. I ended up paid more and get the one by Piegon, that one works so much better."
1,Didn't make it easier,I bought these to help trim my newborn's nails. I found the clippers hard to grasp and didn't make cutting my baby's nails any easier.
4,Great for my baby,"We bought this item hoping it would be a great product like all the other Tweezerman products I have. It's great. My son has strong, fast-growing nails and we have to use this all the time. I haven't used the file too much but the little nail clipper is perfect for my little one."
2,wisdom mired in guck,"This unfortunately seems to be the only English edition of this classic that is available. ""Unfortunately"", because the translator has indulged in putting sections of the text into a horrible singsong archaic rhyme form. Here's a random selection: ""How eluding and vague/ All types including!/How vague and eluding,/All beings including!/How deep and how obscure./ It harbors the spirit pure,/Whose truth is ever sure,/ Whose faith abides for aye/ From of yore until to-day."" If you can tolerate this, there are some stunning thoughts here - but that's a big if."
2,Leg holder?,"This is my second Camp Chef stove. The last one was a 2-30K BTU burner unit. It did a decent job but the burners didn't last as long as I thought they should.The Outdoorsman has 2-60K BTU burners and that enticed me to try another stove. What struck me right off was that the hardware to secure the legs and windscreen to the stove are no longer included with the stove and I don't find them even available to buy as an accessory. I'm guessing that's because they would rather sell us the carrying case? Without the case I'll have to figure out how to transport the stove, 4 legs, windscreen, and regulator and keep them from bouncing around in the back of my truck and later do my best to ensure all these loose pieces don't fall out of the mule packs along the trail.I'm an outdoor cook and I'll be taking this stove on a short 10-day hunting trip and give it a test. I may amend my review after that."
5,Those who love home canning will love this!,"This outdoor burner is the best I've seen. It allows for two pots to cook and water to boil in no time flat. No more messy water bath on your stove inside! You can process twice as many canning jars in the water bath or cook corn and your clams all at the same time for you next big party! This is sturdy, easy to store and no more black bottom on your pots because of the regulator it has! There is an optional griddle to purchase so you can cook on it too! A+"
3,But be warned,"I fully agree with other reviewers that this is an excellent purchase if you are canning, brewing etc. However, be warned this stove is extremely hot. Perhaps I should have understood this from the BTU but I didn't (and nor does the Camp Chef website have any clear warning about this). I cracked two grill plates and two heavy cast iron pots within a couple of minutes on this stove (including a cast iron pot on top of the grill plate!). I do not think you could use this stove for anything other than high volume liquids. Personally I think the novices out there, like me, need a warning of some type to make that perfectly clear."
4,Todo un descubrimiento este autor.,"Me gusta mucho el piano, y buscando autores poco conocidos (al menos por mi), encontre este disco,segundo volumen del autor."
5,"Hot, not just your lap top","I began reading this book and did not stop until the last page. The story was so well told my lap top heated up. From the first page you empathize w/ Clarissa and her lostness. It's predictable that Mick is her man, but how that will happen is fun to read and suppose. The twist and turns of the story keep you reading. In fact, I'm turned on and tuned in for a second run through."
2,Hiccupy Rhythm,"Rhythm is the lifeblood of music: if you ain't got rhythm, you ain't got nuthin. And I'm sorry to have to say, this dude doesn't have it. Or rather, he has it, but it's fatally flawed: uneven, hiccupy, distorted, offputting. It ranges from subtle to blatant; for just one good example of the latter (there are plenty more), listen to No. 9 from the 34 Valse Sentimentales. What can he be thinking of? Makes you scratch your head, that someone could put in all that effort and yet remain oblivious to something so vital."
3,Monkeys Wrote this?,"Great read, but as others have said, not a reference book. Vince Staten and I share a love of a writer I won't mention ('cause it's a bit of a surprise), and his style is similar.I've actually been _in_ one drugstore he mentions in another book, and spent some time near his hometown.Biased? Yeah....My only real complaint - some of the stranger tools mentioned might have benefited by pictures or sketches. While I only found a few things that I didn't at least know something about, I'm sure not every reader is going to have seen some of this stuff."
3,monkey business,"Mr Staten might have worked in a hardware store but he still lacks some basic knowledge like what the difference is between a stillson wrench, a pipe wrench, or a crescent wrench."
2,Doesn't Crimp Well,I have wasted many expensive Zenith connectors learning how to use this tool. Some connections separate too easily. There must be a better product that does not use a proprietary system setup like Zenith.
2,Doesn't work on all connectors,I'm sure it works fine for the connectors that match it but it doesn't fully compress PPC EX6 fittings. Occasionally the fitting can be easily pulled off.
5,One of my top 10 favorite CDs,"I was introduced to this CD some six years back. I thought at first that it was beautiful, but somewhat depressing. I did NOT think that it was boring. Tired old cliched music doesn't cut it for me anymore.I kept listening to it. After listening to it 4 or so times, I realized it wasn't depressing. It was just beautiful. It IS beautiful. When I want to just listen and feel and visualize what I'm hearing, and just thoroughly enjoy what I'm listening to, this is the CD for me. Some music I listen to when I'm angry (Metallica or Alice in Chains -- Dirt), some music I listen to for dancing (Beastie Boys or Arrested Development), some I listen to just for listening, for the skill and intricacy (Pink Floyd). Some I listen to for the skill and the beauty. That would be The Doors, Passage -- Wellspring, Black Sabbath -- Paranoid, Alice In Chains -- Jar of Flies.Buy it. There aren't that many good ones around."
5,"Nice practice ""put""",I purchased this for my daughter to practice with. Perfect for home and practice. Great value. Perfect for junior high and high school athletes.
3,Not Gospel,"I have not read this specific book Amazon is trying to sell. I found a free PDF version of this apocryphal book online, just search for it. This in no way should be taken as fact. It is not in the New Testament canon nor is there any historical relevance to this book. This is more like fan fiction than anything that resembles truth. I rated this at three stars because as a work of fiction it may appeal to some readers."
1,Sorry... Final Draft is better... NOT Buggy,"I tried this and Final Draft side by side while evaluating what to buy. Final Draft is just less buggy and more professional.Movie Magic pops the cursor around the screen after an operation. It also has these windows 3.1 looking interface windows. The speech system is too dependent on windows and not self contained like Final Draft.True, there is more customization with Movie Magic... but I like Final Draft MUCH better. Run them next to each other and u will see.Mike"
3,not as easy as they make it sound!,"I am just getting started using the program so I can not yet judge the overall product. I can tell you that the product description said: just load the software and you will be writing scripts in minutes regardless if you are a first timer or a pro.That is a stretch. I had to get a tech guy to load the program and then it really is not walking me through the ""how to"" part of script writing.Just be prepared to spend some time at the beginning."
2,Lots of problems,"I've read a lot of good reviews for this program, and it came highly recommended. But I've had so many problems with the software, (I'm PC based), and have had no response from Technical Support, email or otherwise. The links on their site mainly are dead. I am planning to buy the competitor product. Screenwriter has been a frustrating program, and a waste of my money.Some of the recurring problems:- Generates roughly a third of the script's breakdown, then stops.- ""Print to PDF"" function consistently creates a blank PDF file."
4,Movie Magic Screenwriter reviewed at Microfilmmaker.com,"""...The best thing about Movie Magic Screenwriter is that is seems to have something for everyone - from the beginner to the professional, everything is covered. And because it's not limited to screenwriting, there's such a wide variety of things that one can do - who knows, you may accidentally discover that you have a knack for writing video games!If you have dreams of writing an Oscar-winning screenplay, or even being a TV writer, Movie Magic is definitely the way to go - the features are amazing, and it's not really all that expensive, considering what you get. But if you're not used to screenwriting software or are new to the whole screenwriting process, better download the free demo first and get acquainted with it before you shell out the big bucks.But really, I don't blame any of you for drooling. I still am..."" -Monica Deleeuw-Taylor, Microfilmmaker.com"
5,Maarvis Staples: Only For The Lonely,"This is a great album to listen to while traveling, at work, sitting around with friends or just working around my home."
1,not so great clip,"decent pouch but very very bad clip. The clip loosens over time, that means does not stay in place - i.e., your pocket or belt. Not recommended."
1,Disgruntled groupie looking for attention,"I completely agree with the other 1 star review: Ms. Meskunas is obviously a frustrated, disgruntled groupie looking for any type of attention she can get. I thought this book was a collection of derogatory jabs aimed at a man she supposedly admires. Grow up, Brenda!"
1,How to influence friends to write reviews,"It appears that the only people who REALLY REALLY LOVE this book are friends of Ms. Meskunas (which is a surprise, because I didn't think she had that many friends)."
5,LOVED this book!,"I laughed out loud so many times while reading this book that I was waiting for the neighbors to come knocking on the door with a BIG net!! I lost myself in the trials and tribulations of fandom - having been there a few times myself. It takes a brave soul to be able to laugh at oneself - way to go, Brenda! And, for those that think Barry would be insulted - how sad to think that HE isn't able to laugh at himself. I highly recommend this lighthearted, stress reducing read!"
1,Not Precision,The smallest wrenches do not fit the hex-head screws I need to turn. They are not even proper hexagons. The larger ones may be OK. Not worth the shipping to return it.
2,Meh.... spend money on some good stuff,"If you need wrenches that actually fit, spend money on a better set. Also, the case is a total piece of junk. Every time you open it wrenches fall all over the place. Not happy with this purchase, but it's not Amazons fault."
2,Not great,"Many of the keys have a slight bend to them. Some of the keys seem to be sized slightly too small (can cause stripping). The case, although an excellent layout organizationally, is low quality and the tools sometimes pop out of place. Overall, the set feels cheapy and I don't like it."
3,"2.5, 2.0. 1.5, 1.3, .9. .7... what kind of sequence is that?","I had a 1.5mm hex and knew that was too big. Saw that this one had smaller and hoped one would fit. The smallest wrenches go from 2.5 to 2.0 to 1.5 then to 1.3 to .9 and finally .7. It seems to me the logical progression down would have included a 1mm size which what I suspect I need. Oh well. seems like this set may be useful to me someday, but not right now. I'm not sure what the popular metric sizes would be, but based on the sequence down it seems to go haywire lower than 1.5mm."
1,don't bother,"I can't comment yet on the usability of the ""tools"" but the case is so cheap that on that point alone you should not bother. I wish I woud have read the reviews before I ordered but I was in a hurry. Just spent my evening trying to glue back all the broken plastic clamps in the case that are supposed to hold them in place. I think they count on people like me that are just too busy and tired to make it to the post office to send them back. Not sure if they counted on me writing a review telling everyone else to go buy elsewhere."
3,"Decent Tools, Horrible Case","The tools arrived and seem to be a mid range quality product, which was to be expected for the price. The case is cheap plastic and was broke when it arrived and no longer securely holds the wrenches. The only reason I'm not returning it is I'm not using the OEM case for storage."
4,I am Happy,For nine dollars i am happy with the product. Maybe their not precision but there is always a wrench that seems to fit. For the price they do the job. If some of these reviews want precision then go buy a set of snap on Allen wrenches and see what you will pay.
5,Perfect Description Rapid Delivery,"This tool is perfect for any job, sizes vary from very small to big.Its perfect"
4,A decent set for the price,I guess for the price I paid for these one cannot really complain. Bought them to use for guitar setup and repair which they seem to be good for. One thing that sold me on these was that the set includes a great varity of sizes including a few hard to find sizes. One thing that bugs me though is the fact that the standard sizes are longer than the metric sizes. Makes no sense to me. But hey for less than 7.00 I guess I really can't complain!!!!!!
1,Cheap quality product !!,"very cheap quality,China Steel ..the allen bit rounds off and unable to use.poor fit !! Dont buy this Product !!"
5,"Great example of the ""St. Louis Sound"" in Blues","This is an outstanding CD...get it while you can. The grooves found on this CD, especially ""Jack and Coke"" are what typifies the ""St. Louis Sound"" in blues music today. In addition to Erskine Oglesby, one of the top ""honkin' and Shoutin' style sax players today, you've got a killer all-star-all-St. Louis session crew, featuring Kenny Lawrence on drums, former Little Milton/James Brown sideman Charles ""Nephew"" Davis on bass, Chuck Berry/Arthur Williams piano groovemeister Bob Lohr, and Brian ""Pennsylvania Slim"" Melching on guitar. One of the best blues CD's released in the past several years."
4,Would Be perfect but...,worth the money just for the amount of figures as well as the awesome box display and dont even get me started with the Fett. The figures included are not the most detailed or articulated but is great to leave this one in the box because it displays rather well with the included Skiff and Sarlaac cardboard cutouts.
3,Mr. A meets freeform jazz!,"Angelo Moore is great, but he should stick with fishbone. I have never been dissappointed by fishbone, but this is not fishbone. Maybe it's me, but I think it's pretty weak.I did like 'nate porcrasto', but stick with Fishbone. Sorry"
2,"Does okay 320x240 @ 15 fps, but that's not much","I have used mine for both biking and skiing. The video is jerky for biking and very jerky for skiing. It's difficult to watch the skiing, but the biking video can be a fun reminder. The built-in laser for alignment is too dim to be useful outdoors. The cam on the mounting pad clicks into different positions, and is a bit tricky to align, but will stay when set. The included (very thick) rubber band made for a good mount on both a bike helmet and a ski helmet. Field of view also seems a bit limited. Single button operation plus confirmation sound made it possible to operate with a mitten while on a helmet (on my head). As a novelty gimmick, it's fun to capture video you cannot get any other way, but don't expect much."
1,Save your money,"If you want to get dark and grainy videos with unsynchronized sound, then by all means go ahead and buy this camera. Even on a bright sunny day the captured footage leaves a lot to be desired. The angle of view is tiny. The resolution is tiny and the frame rate is extremely low. If you are doing any activity that involves a lot of movement (why else would you buy this camera?) you will end up with a very jumpy and confusing video.This camera is promoted as a great bargain, but unfortunately in this case you get exactly what you paid for - a novelty store item that will end up collecting dust in the back of the same drawer that you dump your obsolete cell phones in.If you really want to get decent quality first person videos, you will have to shell out upwards of $100-$150 for an Oregon Scientific or Tachyon XC. If you try to do it on the cheap with this camera, you will still end up with an Oregon Scientific or Tachyon XC except it will cost you an extra $30 plush shipping."
4,Worth the Money,"You have to remember you're only spending $[...] or so on this product so you can't expect some awesome quality videos. For the money I paid I was actually suprised how well it works. I used it for horse back riding, videoing on the flat and over fences. It's easy to work and the quality is pretty comparable to the video on my 5mp HP camera. It does only record for 15 minutes at a time but I put a 512MD SD card in there and got three 15 minute clips. For fun this camera is a good buy."
4,"Incompetent, or constant complainer?????","I don't understand why people gave this cam only 1 & 2 stars??? The video is very good and it only takes a few footage takes to get the cam set perfectly for motocross riding. It just takes a little patience (very little) and know how to set up......in other words if you can open a gift wrapped box then you can figure this thing out. When it's played on a computer the picture is very good and scrolls perfectly, and the sound is really good also. I was skeptical about this thing based on some reviews but man, my buddy and I were pleasantly surprised at how good the video and sound actually were. Our motocross video footage looked exactly like it does in real time. Bottom line is this thing is perfect for what it's made for and what it cost, and what it is........a good cheap way to archive your fun times or for some of us our painful times. Buy it! You'll be glad you did. A good way to spend 50 bucks.............."
1,worthless is you have VISTA,"I bought one of these at a toys r us going out of business sale 3 or 4 years ago and thought it was a great cheap helmet cam. I suggested it to my girlfriend recently as its great for the money. She picked it up and its not compatible with VISTA! You need an older windows OS for the hardware, not the software, to be compatible! I emailed Digital Blue, the cheap company that makes the camera, and they say the camera's are too old for them to care about developing a driver for them to work with Vista! If you do not have an older OS this is a WASTE OF MONEY! If anyone reading this knows a way around this problem please comment this review so we can get our $50 worth!"
3,Needs a little more!!,For $50.00 USD its really not a good buy.I did not like this item because if it is bumped it will freeze up and stop working and you will loose all the video you just recorded. Also when I got it I could not put the data card in because there was a little piece of plastic crammed down in side the slot.If it was shock resistant to small bumps then it would be a good buy but every time its bumped there goes all my filming. Pain in the butt.
2,no good,"The second time i used this, the motor burnt out on me. I took it back to the store and got a new one and made another batch of ice cream, which came out alright, but too runny for my taste. I attempted to make another batch but it never froze. After 3 hours of trying to figure it out and make the mixture thicken, I gave up. I would not reccomend this to anyone. I might have been doing it wrong the whole time, but I'd like a product thats easier to use."
2,Some major problems with this coffee maker. Our second one just died this week.,"Love the taste of the coffee, and the convenience of ""cup on demand"", but there are some serious design flaws with these units, and similar Cuisinart coffee makers using the same electrical circuitry. Our second unit failed this week, with intermittent switch function, then total failure, where nothing will power up. Seems I'm not the only person that has had this same problem.I'm giving them a call today to see what they will do. We love this unit, Cuisinart COD-4000SA, when it works, but they need to get this fixed. It's a coffee maker, not the friggin space shuttle.Had to get out the old peculator and I'm a bit owly this morning. They seem to last a year or two, then bam.....no power."
3,Great while it lasted,I loved this coffee pot and it has lasted me about 2 years but over the weekend it just quit on me. The power comes on but it wont brew the coffee. I had loved this machine and had been hoping that it would last longer than it did.
4,COFFEE BY THE CUP WITHOUT PODS A MASTERPIECE!,"IF you think you need pods for coffee by the cup surprise you no longer need to be a slave to a selection of average coffee pods with proprietary interests that do not work universally on all machines. I am tired of pods that work on one machine but not another and none tasting fresh or full bodied. Here is the solution...Use the coffee you choose and load up the machine and make yourself coffee by the cup on your own terms. No pods, no fear of your pod system becoming obsolete if the machine maker goes out of business, no stale coffee. If you want average cooffee with plastic cups go ahead...but if you simply want single serve coffee without having to make a whole pot and no clean up issues but your cup ...welcome to the Cuisinart Demand."
2,"Great Idea, Does Not Last","I have used this coffee maker for 2 years. It just stopped working, you turn the brewer on and it will not brew. My friend also had the same issue after 1 year with this product. I am going to have to go back to a carafe. I was dissapointed for the $$$"
1,COD 400P,Purchased my COD 4000pc a little over a year ago.. Liked the features..no pot. hot good tasting coffee.. Unforunatley it failed and is now in the trash. So much for quality construction.
2,Good coffee but poor quality,I have had $10.00 makers more durable than this coffee maker. Have used about two years. Every so often it would quit working. I would finagle with it 10 or 15 minute and it would work for a few more months. This time it quit for good. Heater works but it won't pump water up to the coffee grounds and filter. Very dissapointed with product. It will be a long time before I buy another cuisinart product.
2,Lasted 18 months have to pay shipping both ways to get a new one.,"Noticed last night that there was no power in my Coffee on Demand coffee maker. Moved it to another outlet but still no luck. Plugged and unplugged a number of times and magically, the clock came on. 2 hours later it was off. Fidgeted with it a number of times and it once again came on. Set the programmer for this morning. Yep, you guessed it right, no coffee. Fiddled with it again and was able to manually brew it, or so I thought. Came back about 10 minutes later, it had power, but had made no coffee. After getting a Pepsi from the fridge for my daily caffeine fix, I looked at the coffee maker and it was moving the gas gauge. Finally got my coffee. When I returned from Church, the power once again was not on.Don't think I will send it back when I have to pay shipping both ways. Don't know how long it will last. Searched the internet and I am not the only experiencing this.No more Cuisinart for this family."
3,COD-4000 vs DCC-2000,"There is a difference between the COD 4000 without a water filter and the newer model DCC 2000 with a filtration system AND the gold basket. Also, previous reviewers complain about filling travel sized mugs. I slide out the catch tray and move the unit so that its at the edge of the counter and dispense. Problem solved. For me it fills a six inch cup WITHOUT having to move it out."
1,Cuisinart cod 4000 series,"MY Cuisinart cod 4000 series got me yesterday morning. I unplugged the unit while it was still on and keeping my coffee hot to move it away from electrical outlet. My GFI outlet in the kitchen short circuited and I suspect my coffee maker had a bad on/off knob. Either way the thing now turns on, has power, I can adjust all time settings but the thing just wont brew the coffee. I pulled out an older cheaper model cuisinart maker just to brew a cup today. It did the job even after sitting in my closest for 2 1/2 years. Thankfully, this fancy model was a christmas gift that i didnt spend my money on. High priced piece of junk. Called Cuisinart about the 3 year limited warranty and she told me because i unplugged the unit they could not help as it was not considered ""normal household use"". I'll have my wife call tomorrow to tell them it just stopped working on it's own...we'll see what they say about that..."
5,"Excellent coffee, excellent machine","I am sorry that so many others have has such problems! We registered for this and have been using it for about a year and a half now with no problems. Coffee brews quickly and can even be accessed while it is still brewing if you need a cup fast (late for work?). easy to fill, use, program, etc. and leaving it heated for a few hours does not burn the coffee. Excellent product so far.Combined with the Cuisinart DBM-8 Supreme Grind Automatic Burr Mill (CCM-16PC1) our coffee lives are fulfilled."
1,Cusinart Coffee on Demand,"Excellent Coffee Maker for a few months, then just quit pumping, light and heater is on but nothing comes out. too bad worked good for almost 1 year. This is the second Cusinart went bad way too soon. Maybe they have a problem."
3,Cuisinart COD-4000,"Love the concept of ""coffee-on-demand,"" but it's back to the drawing boards for Cuisinart - the unit DOES NOT last! If you don't mind kicking out $90 per year, O.K. Ours died just after a year of use - thought it was going to catch on fire."
1,not good,"it started leaking and then just quit working after about 6 months, I did love it while it worked now it is hard to get used to another pot but 6 months use just is not worth it."
5,A GREAT RECORD,"The more I listen to this, the more I like it. It's the work of a grown-up who can still rock when he wants to, but who now picks and chooses those moments when he wants to pump it up. ""Where Home Used to Be"" is beautiful and haunting, ""The Spell is Broken"" is a vintage Marshall hook on a tricky frame with really interesting production. In fact, the production on the whole thing is MC's best work yet producing himself. One of the only things I'm listening to these days."
3,Two In A Row,"Another laid-back, rather unfocused affair. Very mellow. Definitely not bad, but not particularly memorable either. I miss the old days..."
2,Not worth the money,"Took the risk even though I was aware of the negative reviews. Ordered the product and was excited to get it. For the price tag I was hoping to get my monies worth. It turned out that the product is not as good as ECTACO makes you believe. ECTACO claims that it can translate sentences. Clearly this is not the case; it only translates the words in the sentences from English to Spanish word to word as a result you get a sentence that doesn't make sense when translated into Spanish. It can't even translate the most basic sentences in English to a understandable form of Spanish. I was quite disappointed and I knew that after 2 days of using it was clearly not worth its hefty price tag. I ended buying the Franklin BES-1850 its better and more affordable.Pros: Color screen, talks clearly, and multiple phrases you can learnCons: 2 expensive, bulky/heavy, doesn't translate sentences correctly, poor return policy"
1,Shoddy meter,A poor quality item that malfunctioned within 60 days (and only a few uses) since purchase. It is probably of Chinese origin. I will now look for a quality US made product that will be more expensive but last much longer.
3,The Thin Man Out of His Element,"The sophisticated Charleses go to funky Sycamore Springs, the town where Nick grew up. Frankly, I like him better in a big city setting. But anyway.He thinks he's just come for a vacation and to visit his parents, but everyone assumes he's working on a case. He's a famous detective, after all. But he's resisting the implications pretty successfully until a young artist falls dead at his doorstep. And of course there are plenty of suspects, perhaps one could say the entire town. Everyone is acting suspicious for one reason or another, although most of that has nothing to do with the murder.But just as Nick is apparently getting a handle on the first murder, Crazy Mary is found dead in her reclusive cabin with its ""Keep Out"" sign on the door. Oddly enough, this second murder provides Nick with a vital clue to the first one.Good movie, but not as good as the earlier ones."
4,Sobering.....and Fun,"This is a very pleasant entry into ""The Thin Man"" series. I found it much less aggravating than the other stories simply because of the drinking and smoking factor, which was always overdone in this series despite the great writing and acting talents of the two leads, William Powell and Myrna Low.Unbelievably, Powell and Loy don't have a drop of alcohol to drink in the entire film. In this film it's just ""Nick"" and ""Nora"" solving a crime on their own and then - in Charlie Chan-type style - rounding up all the suspects in one room and exposing the criminal while explaining the case.Generally, it's a fun movie with interesting characters. Don't look for a lot of action but you'll get a lot of laughs."
4,thin man,I love the old thin man movies and this is one of the best!! William Powell was a great actor and so was Myrna Loy. This is a good movie to curl up to on a cold night. Loved It!!!!
4,"Me and my 45, 6 inch","If you you don't like western movies, you don't care for gun's. My truck lic. plate reads, Only 3 set's me free. Guns,Guts, and God.. I like my gun you made for me it is well balance, has a good grip to it when I draw. Although it does not fire and my toes really thank me for that after my practice. But, it is handsome looking. In the very near future I intend to order 2 more. Another 45, and a 44 6-inch. thank you again...."
5,"THAT'S A PLENTY, AND THEN SOME!","Someone at Amazon has gone to a lot of trouble to set out all 100 titles but without adding the artists, which renders the exercise fairly meaningless. The set embraces New Orleans, New York, Chicago, Kansas City and territory bands, not to mention the blues. Some of the best-known names of the time are represented, together with some of the most obscure. If you're on a budget, but want an audio crash course in classic jazz, without the lecture notes, then you can't go wrong with this set."
5,Dixieland Jazz: This was the Jazz age.,"Muito esta coletnea de Dixieland Jazz, so vários artistas e compositores, dá para saber o que foi o estilo. Este produto vale à pena estar na lista para ser ouvido, seja músico ou apreciador, amante de música."
1,a seriously inaccurate measuring instrument,"this hygrometer when placed beside two other hygrometers of different manufacture and of known accuracy, proved to be consistently off in its measurment by 20%. After disassembling and recalibrating it, it improved to 10% off of actual values, but then was no longer consistent in the degree of error. In other words, get back to the drawing board you designers of this mistake!"
2,Uncalibrated,"I bought a set of 5 of these; each one gives a different reading, even if I leave them next to each other for hours."
5,Cuban legend,"Do yourself a favour and buy this brilliant overview of a Cuban great before it is deleted. If Spanish held as much sway as English in the music world of the 40's, 50's and 60's, Benny would be as big as Frank. Great tunes, great recordings and a lot of fun. A good booklet with biographical details and some nice photos of Benny and the bands rounds out a well presented package."
1,I never recieved the product!,I have been waiting many weeks and still have not received this product. I paid for it in full... where is my lip gloss???
3,Mex ganster rap.,Rap is not really my thing but Hispanic rap is unique in it's approach to the sounds used and the vocal phrasing seems to sit tighter with the music than most other rap albums.This guys voice is weird in a sort of funky way and so is the music so just for a change I will jump into my low rider bounce the front end hydraulics up and downat the traffic lights(as you do)and groove to the Maestro.See you downtown Homes!
1,"Racist Cover, Portada Racista","This supposed to be a Romantic song collection, I am very disappointing with Amazon to allowed this racist caricature on the cover.No compres este disco racista, la caricatura de un supuesto hombre hispano en la portada del disco es una verdadera groceria para toda la comunidad latina.Amazon no deveria permitir esto, Por lo menos otras minorias no lo permitirian o serian sensible a esto."
3,A Good Story - but it isn't HARDBOUND.. it is a BOARD BOOK,"The is a nice christmas story. A story to read with family and friends during the season... and brings a spirit of remembrance towards the life & gifts of Christ.But be forwarned - this book is not what I expected as a ""HARDCOVER"" book (ie a hardbound hardback book). It is a BOARDBOOK (a book where each page is made of thick cardstock).If you want a book in this format... this is a good story to have in your childrens library."
5,Fun with a message,"The Legend of Spookley the Square Pumpkin. The DVD animation is full of songs and action that our 5 year old loves. Although it can be enjoyed as a simple adventure, there are several themes interwoven within the story that explore selfishness, intolerance of differences and bullying as well as believing in yourself, unselfishness and valuing diversity.The video version differs significantly from the book. Both are good but the differences are important. So, it is particularly nice that the video animation is followed by an excellent reading of the book accompanied by still pictures of the actual pages of the book including the text. The words are highlighted in sync with the vocalization which makes this part an excellent tool for teaching reading.I strongly recommend both this DVD version and the book (with CD)."
4,A favorite among children and adults in the household,"It not only get's a thumbs up from my nearly two year old nephew who loves this movie and ask for it by name, ""Spookey"" but from his adult mother who loves the songs."
5,Rudolph for Halloween...,"Instant classic - very cute and entertaining, pleasing to watch. It's like the Rudolph story, but for Halloween - teaches acceptance of differences and kids love it. My 4 kids (9, 5, 4, and 1) all watch it and love it. Cute songs, great graphics, and I just hope this company produces some more holiday shows!"
4,Scarily fun,"Looking for a family movie off of Unbox? This one is fine for everyone. While there are bats, spiders, and itty bitty ghosts, they are not scary at all for any child. This is a cute movie and is perfect for discussing:- how being different is important- how to deal with teasing- why you shouldn't eat bugs (one of the bats is trying to stop eating bugs)- the definition of love (one of the spiders is in love with a bat)Overall, funny and a good little rental for the kids!"
4,good product,i was very pleased with this dvd.. the condition was very good and even the case was in good standing... shipping was pretty quick also
1,It just takes saving someone's life for acceptance,"I bought this on a whim for my 17 month old son and we are never watching it again. Yes, as the other reviewers said, there is an element of acceptance in here, but he had to save their lives for them to stop bullying him and see his value. Not exactly the message I want to teach my son."
5,Sp;ookley the square pumpkin,Great movie for kids. Teaching how if you are different it is okay. Would highly reccommend for children to see
1,Great!.... for 4 months......,"It worked great for the first 4 months but then it went dead... I was really carefull with this battery, even taking it out of the bay while connected to the outlet and the use of that laptop is at most 3 times a week... there is simple no reason for this. Now it barely last 4 mins (I have to run with it to take the laptop from one room to the next and plug it back)."
2,very annoying,"Everything on my Stokke Xplory is so well thought through and so well designed, with the exception of this umbrella. Despite it's adjustability , I can't seem to position it so that it blocks the sun, but not my view. When I use it, as I must in the sunny summer months, I feel like i am walking blind. I can't see ahead of me to say nothing of the fact that I can't see my son. Would it have killed them to include a little window? Or better yet, perhaps they could simply design an extension to the hood so that it effectively blocked the sun and eliminate the need for the umbrella altogether."
5,the king of kings,This an excellent CD the king of flow is truly the king of flow excellent vocals and tracks the remakes of marvin gayes sexual healing is awesome and the salsa track is cheerful and fresh.
5,it's awesome,"i think this album is killer! if i had any money right now i would definetly buy it. i haven't seen them live but judging by the cd, i would make my way to the front of the stage in a hurry. great job guys and good luck!"
4,A great-sounding CD with lots of beautiful ballads.,"I've seen Azure perform live and know how good they are, but I didn't expect so many great ballads. ""Stick Around"" is an instant classic, and ""Kissy!Kissy!"" is a fun song that my daughter really loves. I wish there were more music on the CD, but other than that, I love it. My husband and I play the first six songs when we want to have a romantic evening together! Great job, guys."
2,A whiny and self-absorbed memoir,"It may have been therapeutic for the author to revisit the emotional insecurites of her childhood, but it's no fun for the reader. I read this book to learn about her experiences as a white girl growing up in Africa, but this is not a book about Africa. It is a book about a whiny and self-absorbed person who is STILL agonizing over not being elected the princess of the Valentine's Dance in middle school. The person I feel sorriest for is her mother, who comes in for criticism for her emotional distance, when all the evidence offered by the author suggests that her mother was a loving and caring parent, albeit with a career of her own.The same week I read this I also read Zenzele. Read that one and give this a miss."
2,I am glad I borrowed this from the library instead of buying.,"I am an MK and thus expected to feel a connection with this book just as I have experienced when reading other TCK/MK oriented books. Maybe I would have felt a connection if I would have kept reading. Yet, after forcing myself on for a few chapters I finally asked myself, why should I continue?The book reads like a free-association transcript. Grasshopper-like chronological jumps back and forth and around again with thoughts, concepts, and feelings equally scattered make it seem this way.This is the type of book I would write if attempting to process the issues in my life. It is not the type of book I would write when attempting to share my life with others."
3,tool sucks,the tol sucks it clamed you dont need anyother tool to install . FALSE.... i had to get cutters nad it did not hold up for the real test dong all four cables i did . I had to buy one for less money. the conectors are the best and i would never buy this product ever again .
4,Yellow?,"It's a good tool, but I wish I'd got one before Stanley put the yellow paint on them. Saw them in the store when they were unpainted, hesitated not sure if I needed it. Decided a couple of months later to go get it at Lowe's and they were yellow. Every one hanging there had the yellow and it was already chipping off and they hadn't been used. Flakes of yellow on the display shelf below. I know color shouldn't matter, it's a prybar and you'll beat the hell out of it... So maybe I'm weird but I didn't buy a tool that looked that bad new. Came to Amazon hoping to order the older model. I'll probably buy the yellow one, just thought I would comment in case anyone else cares about the finish/appearance of a tool. Buying a new tool that already looks worn just bugs me."
4,Rolls-Royce of pry bars,"Excellent design - highly functional - but more quality than needed. Consequently, tool is overpriced except for those who find gratification in owning ""the best""."
4,stanley fubar,"great tool for destruction, especially ripping out drywall. I'm not that strong so it's not too heavy to use for a couple of hours, but not too light to swing with force... mighty destroyer!"
5,Amazing Tool,"I saw this demonstrated on a DIY show, I checked on it locally but was very happy to get it here at such a great price. Love it and it does everything it says it will. This is a lifetime tool."
3,"Power non-redundant, long bootup time, constant firmware updates...","Server runs well, but unless you are on a 220-volt power outlet the 2 power supplies are NOT redundant (stupid). Bootup time is horrific, at least 5 minutes before it even looks for a bootable OS. Requires constant firmware updates (which includes seperate updates for BIOS, preboot diagnostics, BMC, CPLD, Raid BIOS, Raid firmware, disks, etc)."
4,Time to Let go by lurlene Mcdaniel,"The book Time to Let go is a good suspence and romance novel. It is about a girl named erin, who i feel is a well rounded and realistic character. She lost her sister Amy in a car accident a year ago. Ever since her sister died she has been getting really bad headaches. The doctors cannot find a physical reason why they come and what causes them. She begins to see a theripist and at first they cannot find a reasion why they come when they do, and what keeps causing them. eventually they start to come less and less and they find out what is causing them. They begin to work on making them stop completly. To find out why her headaches come you have to read the book."
4,Time to Let Go,"If you like problems with life stories you must read Lurlene McDaniel's ""Time to Let Go"". the main characters are Erin, David, a guy from Erin's school,and Erin's parents.It took place in a therpist office and at school. What happen was Erin is a girl who happens to get headaches. She started to get this because her younger sister, Amy, died a year ago. There is a guy from school that gives her headaches. Her parents suggested that she would see a thrapist to talk to her. the conflict is that Erin is having bad headaches and bad nightmares. The major theme is telling your parents what is happening to you and your life.I kind of like this book. There was one thing I couldn't understand. The book is perfect.It's like what might happen in real life. Erin's life gets settled. I chose this book becaues I love Lurlene McDaniels' book. But this book was sort of borning. My friend Kelly loves her books. She would actually read this book."
2,Maag did it better 35 years ago,"This recording isn't bad. But Maag's best outing with thePrague Symphony was that classic London Blueback from the mid-1960s with the London Symphony. It is still the best Prague I've ever heard, and I wish to GOD someone would re-release it. It's fantastic. This current outing doesn't compare, alas.If you want a great Prague, try Charles Mackerras on Telarc. For stylish, unmannered modern-instrument performance, it's hard to beat. Until that classic Maag recording comes back."
5,Maag and Mozart,"This is as fine a Mozart release as you're ever likely to find. Coming late in his career, Peter Maag's work with the orchestra of Padua and Venice resulted in a truly great Beethoven symphony cycle as well as four cds devoted to Mozart's later symphonies, all available on the Arts label. Expert direction (highly musical and well-informed historically), a very fine, classically balanced orchestra and excellent digital recording add up to a cd which every Mozart lover should investigate. Peter Maag was one of the more important conductors of his day and he has left us a fine and unexpected legacy of recordings. His Mozart is unbeatable. Hear it for yourself. Strongly recommended."
3,Recommended For Lovers of Historical Romance,"Mary Luke has created a very interesting and creative story. She has a remarkable knack for folding vast amounts of historical information into the narrative in a seemingly casual way, this alone was impressive.I liked much of this unique and creative story and enjoyed the history woven throughout, but overall it was just a little bit too romantic for my tastes.I almost hate to leave a three star rating because there was so much that was interesting and clever but I have to be honest and say this just wasn't one of my favorites.If you are thinking of reading this I would say go ahead and give it a try, you might just love it. I can certainly see how people would really love it. Especially if this were your first introduction to historical fiction.This could be a 'gateway book' that would lead a reader to more historical fiction.I recommend it for fans of Historical Romance."
1,Total garbage ... this is not dance music at all,"It is a collection of urban hip hop - not dance music at all. Perhaps this is what is being played in Toronto's urban scene, and the videos on the pathetically slanted Much Music Canada (our MTV) - then name it something else.If you want 'dance' that this series 'used to put on these releases' by music collections from SPG Music - www.spgmusic.comThen, you'll hear 'dance music' - not this trashy attempt to brainwash people into thinking urban is dance music today.Maybe to some it is, but not to anyone who bought this series in the last many years.You can also find music by searching amazon.ca using 'SPG' as the search word.J.D. / Toronto Canada"
4,Just what I've needed,"You could call me a retard with a passion. I've had 3ds for quite a while, and have only just begun to REALLY understand how the program makes sense since reading this book. The organization is excellent, and concise. Unlike video tutorials (at least those from VTC which are really lousy and expensive), just the fact that its a book makes it better for addressing multiple scenarios. The experienced, not-idiot user however may feel a little insulted by the REALLY specific points, however they may still like it as a reference book that it is also great for.The only thing is that I don't believe (I'm about a third through it) that it has anything about rigging and other advanced operations but at an inch thick, for getting down fundimantals down, I consider this book invaluable."
3,un clear,says it will fit xl model Ford Ranger but it does not specify which engine I went to checkK&N; website and it says 4.0L SOHC only not 2.3L or 3.0L.
1,Throw away,I ordered this item because the picture and description looked like what I needed but far from it....so I had to throw them away and it was a waste of money....Bullet obviously does not make replacement parts that are easily gotten.
4,Are we not men?,"This Japanese import takes their cue from Devo, and sustains a punkish energy full of synth warbles and squeaks, as well as smartly-styled pop that always stays on the upbeat. While some of these songs will appear in later releases, the marerial is both inventive and energetic. In fact, it's probably unfair to lump this in the ""Devo"" category; they've long since made strides to make their sound more frenetic and exciting."
4,"Japanese for ""*&^%$#@!!!""","Polysics are an odd Japanese hybrid of new wave/synth pop, punk, electro and all-out noise warfare. Supposedly they're heavily influenced by Devo but it's kind of hard to tell by this release, unless the lyrics take a similar absurdist slant. Again, hard to tell since the lyrics are indecipherable--they could be in English, Japanese, Swahili or Esperanto for all I know. Of course, like most Japanese bands that make it Stateside, the lyrics are the last things one would notice. On ""Hey! Bob! My Friend!"" they come off like a totally bonkers bio-mechanical experiment using the recombinant DNA of Melt Banana, Brainiac and classic Atari video games. If you understood any of that then give yourself some hipster brownie points. Or maybe you're just a total nerd. Guess which one I am? Oh, hell, just buy the CD already."
2,"Too much noise, anyway!","The Polysics from Japan refer to Devo when it comes to describe main influences . . . well, compared to the japanese people even the wonderful Devo where more sort of a pop band. I mean, they also made some kind of unusual noise, as we all know. But that noise made sense, it made people go mad on the dancefloor. The Polysics, compared to Devo, are awful and terribly bad. They make too much noise which is very boring after some few of their attacks. It's not Punk, it's not New Wave, it's not Devo. Sorry my friends, you have failed. And then forget about the singer. He cannot sing at all, maybe that's why you can barely hear him at all. His screams are hidden behind the noise wall of the musicians. When I heard that a mutated band from Japan who is even dressing a bit Devo-ish has come up, I was pleased and very curious. Now i must say, that Devo fans better listen to The Network. That's a great band. And they know how to keep the inheritance of Devo properly!"
2,The Three Evangelists,It wasn't Commissaire Jean Baptise Adamsberg and just dull. It didn't have the usual historical info that Vargas possesses. I missed the crew of police who work with JBA.
5,One of our favorite authors,Fred is our favorite mystery author. Her character development is not to be out done. We highly recommend her series to anyone looking for a good read.
5,Her Best,I thoroughly enjoyed and highly recommend this mystery - such a wonderfully entertaining group of sleuths. I really like the way the author mixes a bit of history into her plots and I think this is her best book yet.
2,good enough,"it is not that perfect book ,but it is so good to guid you through the important topics..it is so good only with the help of real text book..the first chapter is full of mistakes..but the other chapters are good specailly the last chapters ..they are perfect..really great help..for DAT.."
3,Not your Traditional Christmas CD,"I thought these CD's were ok....there were a lot of songs I didn't really know, and a lot that were strictly instrumental. Beautiful music, just don't expect a lot of traditional Christmas music. The green CD (first) is better than the red."
4,More than card-ART,"I have been waiting since April to get my hands on Mary Jo McGraw's new book. Of the three, this one is the best. Just when you think there is nothing new to the rubber stamping world, up comes some exciting techniques. Mary Jo gives step by step instructions with photos to match. The illustrations are beautiful, clear, and detailed. Any greeting card made with these techniques will surely be difficult to give away! This book is a must for the rubber stamper's library."
2,not really worth the money,I was really disappointed after I got this book. The only good thing is that the author did teach some new techniques. The samples offered are mediocre and not very inspirational. A lot of them look just like collages...not really rubber stamped art that I can learn from. Maria Nerius' book on rubberstamping was much better!
5,Stax Celebration,"It is a terrific experience to be able to hear so many familiar, classic hits--and a few tunes we may have forgotten--all in one place. Detroit gets a lot of well deserved attention, but there was a lot of good stuff going on in Memphis, not to mention Nashville, during the same period."
4,"Great, but 45 edits again?","If you don't care one way or another, ""The Stax 50th Anniversary Celebration"" will be a quite welcome addition to your collection. I hold back one star for the business end of things, because yet again on a fine compilation, we are given the 45 edits instead of the complete versions of songs. The ONLY time in the past this was not so was on a 1986 JAPANESE Stax comp, which being that it was mastered in the age of CD's infancy, means that it is inferior sonically to what they could do today. I probabbly wouldn't have bought this had I known ahead of time that it contained edits, but like I said before, if you don't care, what is here certainly is worth it as an introduction or as an addition to one's collection. I just wish record companies would stop being scumbags instead of revering the music as it was recorded and meant to be heard, rather than holding up versions of songs snipped to get more airplay."
5,Great collection,The more I listen the more I like this collection. Most of these songs I'm familiar with but there were a few I hadn't heard. It seems to be popular with my friends too.
5,Excellent,This CD is outstanding because it has so many old songs on it and for the price it is well worth it if you are into old soul songs. It will really bring back the memories!!!!!!!!!
3,An uneven compilation,"I suppose this is what happens when the decision is made to cover all of the Stax catalog. You get some great songs, and some very forgettable tunes along with it. It helps to know the label's history. You're not getting songs that Atlantic owns, although for awhile the relationship between Stax and Atlantic was close. There are some gems, though, especially from Otis Redding, Sam and Dave and Eddie Floyd, as well as some songs that never made it big, but should have."
4,STAX,"What a fantastic recording. If you are a true soul/motown fan, this is a set not to be missed! It is a double CD, in a cardboard display box with a great 50 page colour booklet about the Story of Stax, interesting reading too. Disc 1 28 tracks, and Disc 2 22 tracks. So many great tracks it's hard to write a comprehansive review! Otis Redding, Carla Thomas, Eddie Floyd,Sam and Dave, Albert King, Booker T, it's impossible to name them all. Check out the full track list and see for yourselves! I don't think this needs a review - if you like Soul, you must have this in your collection! What a fantastic 50th Anniversary Celebration"
4,Before and After,"In 1968 there was a changing of the guard at Stax and the results were dramatic. The whole approach to making music so changed (along with so much else in the world at the time) that you hear two almost seperate catalogues. For me, the earlier period just defined ""soul"" and that music and those musicians hold a very special place in my world. Stax most likely sold a lot more records in the latter period.It is still a very worthwhile collection as it makes the transition really clear musically and the booklet in the box does a decent job of lending insight into the inner workings of Stax and the folks involved.I also found it interesting that the best known songs and artists still stood out from the more obscure ones. The public got it right in this reviewer's opinion. The downside to that is that I didn't find many hidden gems."
5,Just purchased this here on Amazon.com and my daughter loves it!,"I read one of the reviews here on Amazon.com, purchased the DVD, and my daughter loves it! This is another one to add to her collection of DVDs (disney princess, fairies, barbie)."
5,Great Family Movie,"My family is a big fan of all the Tinkerbell movies. This one is one of the best - it is funny, sweet, and refreshingly clean. I highly recommend it."
4,Rent HD for Your HDTV,I accidentally rented the SD version. For $1 extra it's worth the upgrade. Now if u don't have a HDTV it would be a waste of a dollar.
5,"2nd only to ""Rise of the Guardians"": best animation to date!","Can't believe this never made it to the theaters. Story is good. And $10 is a ""just right"" price for this DVD. It's, for sure, a keeper & well worth that price."
5,Wonderful story,"Like always, this Fairy adventure delivers entertainment for all ages. My girls absolutely love the Tinker Bell series of movies because they offer a great story but there is nothing ""scary"" lurking in the shadows. Just fun and enjoyable."
3,"Cute Tink Movie, but the 2nd Tbell Movie is stil the best","Cute movie, little kids will love this, but from the adult watching this movie, not the most endearing one you will see."
5,All time Fav,"The only thing my daughter loves more than Disney's Rapunzel is Disney's Fairies. Watching this movie with my daughter has and will continue to create some magical memories for us. Right now, it is her all time Fav movie."
4,Sweetness.,I am a fan of clean family fun. This movie is a good example of a film that can watched a few times without encouraging negative behavior/vocabulary or sassy attitude. I love the clever innocence of it. Yea for Tinkerbelle!
3,good but not like the others,"This is a good movie...but if you were looking at all the Tinkerbell movies lined up, this is our least favorite....just not as exciting as the others. Glad we have it...but if you are trying to choose, go with one of the others first."
5,Kids loved it!,Kids loved the movie and it makes a great addition to our collection. Now we have all of the tinker bell movies.
3,If you love Tinkerbell...,"As an adult, this movie is pretty silly. For small children who love Tinkerbell (like my nieces) they will probably like this movie a lot. Lots of animals and the snow/winter fairies are an interesting differentiation from the ""warm weather"" faries (They reminded my of the frost faries from Fantasia). Probably a good movie to watch during the winter given the snow faries."
3,Good for 9 year olds,My nine year old enjoyed this movie. It didn't seem to deep but the themes were appropriate for her age group and she was captivated by it
4,Daughter loved it.,Nice story and animation. Daughter enjoyed and Disney does a great job with the characters. Waiting for the next movie.
4,Perfect for the Family,"My family watched this movie together. . . We are all Believers in Fairies. But it had action, comedy and all the fairy characters that my daughter loves. I even enjoyed the movie. Definatly worth watching."
3,Good to rent not own (unless you love the Fairies' stories),"My daughter isn't that interested the Disney fairies to warrant buying it so the 48-hour online rental was cool. Movie was better than the other Fairy movies (in my opinion). I don't think my 4-yr old likes the Fairy stories enough to care which is better but she did watch the whole movie.I do stream some free Prime videos and rarely pay but wanted to watch this (I'm a big Disney fan). Not related to this movie but I would be prefer some kind of ""2 time"" deal instead of 48-hours. I think it'd be more useful for us to watch it again (with another kid) later in the week than watching it again in same 48-hour span. I like to preview some movies before I let her watch and also she often doesn't feel like finishing it so we don't always get back to TV within 48 hours to finish."
4,I guess my grandaughter likes it,This was purchased for my Grandaughter and she watches it all the time.She is 6 years old and loves anything like this movie.
4,Tinkerbell Lives!,"I liked this movie. I only have one son, and he hated it. Too bad. He had to sufffer through it ;)"
5,Tinker bell movies,"i love disney movies, I saw the entire line-up of Tinker-bell this one was great my nieces hate me for seeing it first"
5,Love it,This is a great movie. I will b adding this to my collection of Tinkerbell movies. This is my favorite one yet.
4,Very cute children's movie,"I'm an adult but I did enjoy this movie. Little girls would love it. However, it perpetuates the myth that all little girls should look perfect and beautiful at all times."
4,good movie,"Kids loved it. Better than the past couple Tinkerbell movies. The story is decent, but could have been a bit better."
2,fair,"A visually beautiful movie, but story line less entertaining. Not much 3D depth effect. Overall very fair, not very worth it."
5,Great Movie,I got this movie for my daughters fourth birthday. She absolutely adores this flick. She owns the previous three tinkerbell movies and has for a long time. Her interest has waned over the past two years and I can't even remember the last time she asked me to put on a tinkerbell movie for her but since she got this movie it is what she wants to watch everyday. IMO it is the best of the four tinkerbell movies so far.
3,Movie,"I purchased 2 of these movies thinking I was getting a good deal, but if I had waited a while longer I found them in the stores for $3 cheaper."
5,Awesome.,Disney did it again. This new Tinkerbell DVD is great. My daughter loves every one of them. This one is not the exception.
4,Not bad,"I have always been a Disney fan but I was pretty reserved about whether or not I'd like this movie. Well, I thought it was really adorable and the story was decent. it was no Beauty and the Beast, but it was enjoyable."
5,Best of the bunch!,I bought this for my daughters last night (via Amazon digital) and they both absolutely loved it! I have to admit that my wife and I both ended up watching it with them and we really enjoyed it too. We are now watching it for the 3rd time!
3,Missing Piece,"Didn't come with the cover over the bluray case. Was expecting that due to the description, so was disappointed when it didn't have it."
4,My favorite of the Pixie Hollow movies,My daughter loved watching this movie! It was so touching and sweet. It really was a great movie about sisterhood and those unbreakable bonds of family. I would recommend it.
2,3d wont play,"I got this for my daughter for Christmas and we were so disappointed. The 3D won't play. I have not had problems with any other 3D Blu-Ray. The movie itself was cute and my 7 year old daughter loved it, but I paid to get 3D and it doesn't work."
4,Cute movie,"My wife and daughters really like Tink. I really enjoyed this movie too, it is fun and very cute. Stunning graphics."
5,Cute movie,"Keeping in the same spirit as previous movies, this one doesn't disappoint. My daughter loved the adventure and innocent story."
4,Another good one,"Our whole family enjoys this series. Crisp, beautiful, animation paired with good story and consistent voice acting. Never condescending or preachy, just quality entertainment. Recommended."
4,Another cute Tinker belle movie,I liked all the Tinker belle movies. My tween aged daughter and I always watch these together and it's always a joy. Definitely worth renting!
5,WE ALL LOVED THIS MOVIE,"IT IS A GOOD FAMILY MOVIE GREAT FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY, I T HAD ME IN TEARS FOR THE SAD PART AND IT WAS REALLY FUNNY"
2,Poor packaging!,I ordered this DVD and the case was shattered when I received the package. I haven't yet played the DVD- I am hoping that the disk is not scratched.
4,Cute Disney Movie,"This movie was really cute and my 9 year old daughter enjoyed it, she just wanted it to have a little bit longer."
4,Emotional and triuphant,"as my 5 year old daughter tells me ""I hope I dont start crying"" at witch time my eyes are watering. The movie had a lot of obsticals and alot of overcoming. My daughter watches it every night."
3,Daughter enjoyed it,"My daughter enjoyed the movie. She has seen most of the Disney producedTinkerbell movies. The movie kept her attention until it was over. If the movie can hold her attention for 90 mins, I take that as a good sign."
1,Broke,Very disappointed for a daughter opening on Christmas Day and it not to work! I will never order again for this person.
5,ONE OF DISNEY'S BEST SECRET OF WINGS IS ADORABLE FUN FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY FOUR STARS,FABULOUS MOVIE VERY CUTE.THE FAIRIES MADE ME LAUGH. CUTE STORY.MY NEPHEW WILL REALLY ENJOY THIS MOVIE FOUR STARS.
4,Great movie,Loved this and so did my niece. I may have liked it more than her. She wanted to watch it again and I was all for it!
5,Best yet,"Watched this with my 9 year old, 7 year old, and husband. We all really enjoyed it and plan on purchasing it"
5,Nice addition to the fairy tradition,"For those little people enthused with Tink in her other movies, this new movie will be a great addition to your collection. My 4 y.o. granddaughter watches it over and over."
3,The girls loved it,"My granddaughters (4&7) loved it because they are really into Tinkerbell. For adults, it is cute and amusing. 3D was good."
3,"Not as good as the first two, but okay","The first two tinkerbell movies were phenomenal in showing little girls how to be industrious, strong, and true to themselves and not perfect pink princesses, blecch. Unfortunately, the writing on this movie could have been so much better. I felt as though the story did not develop fully and could have been best served over a series of movies than just one."
5,excellent movie,"the movie is excellent, and adorable...i would definitely buy the movie if i had to buy it all over again for my daughter..."
4,not exactly what was advertised... but still good,"I can't give it 5 stars because the previews for this movie release in the disney channel nonetheless depicted snowball fights and other scenes that does not at all exist in this movie. None of the previews that I physically saw were in the movie at all.Maybe it is because I got the DVD version?? not sure, but regardless, the movie itself was still good.I don't want to summarize what it is about incase there are those who hate spoilers. What I will say is that although it had none of the previews actually in the movie, my girls still enjoyed it and I don't regret buying it for my girls to add to their tinkerbell collection."
1,a big disappointment,"Brought this for my daughters birthday. Packing is awful, two of disc came in scratched because the are set one on top of the other. Story is not good for younger audience because of love story within it and the stoner fairy was not necessary at all. Very disappointed because of all of that but the animation was very good on a hi-def TV."
2,The Saccharine of the Wings,"This is not the best of the Tink series (that would be the Great Fairy Rescue). The story in outline is sweet, but it's grounded by inflated melodrama and the really awful songs that are poured over every montage like syrup. Does every preteen singer sound the same, regardless of gender? The McClain sisters could have been manufactured in the Disney factory; there is nothing original, personal or distinctive about the songs or their performances: it's an assembly of pre-fab parts and it drags the movie down."
2,So So Disney Fairies Movie,"First, my daughter who loves all things fairies (and princesses) watched the whole movie. However unlike the other Tinkerbell movies, she hasn't had an interest in watching ""Secret of the Wings"" again."
5,Love it.,You can never go wrong with Tinkerbell in our house and there was no way Santa was passing this year without dropping this one my our daughter's stocking.
4,Fast Ship,"Got the video in-time to watch with our grandaughter fo our visit, we enjoyed the movie and all had a great time"
4,Another good Tinkerbell movie,"If you're considering buying Secret of the Wings, there's a good chance you have already seen the first three Tinkerbell movies. This one is a very good entry and fits right in with the others in terms of quality (the second movie, Lost Treasure, is the only dud in the series). The film features fun new characters and big revelations. Megan Hilty (of Broadway and ""Smash"") has replaced Kristen Chenoweth (of ""Pushing Daisies"" and general awesomeness) as Rosetta, which is not very noticeable even if it is a step down. Angelica Houston as Queen Clarion is more featured in this entry, which is nice.I have the DVD/Blu Ray combo pack. The TV special ""Pixie Hollow Games"" is included on both my DVD and Blu-Ray disc special features, so I'd assume you'd get it if you bought just the DVD edition. Pixie Hollow Games is 22 minutes and features Rosetta, though Tinkerbell also has a small role. I don't have a 3D player and don't know if it's on the 3D disc."
4,Who doesn't love Tink,Shipped quickly. Was packaged well as usual. Can't ever give Tink a bad review. Everyone at our house loves her.
5,Great movie for kids.,I rented the movie for my kids to watch. I watched it with them and I enjoyed it myself. It is a movie I would not mind buying at some point for my children.
4,It was cute,"It was cute, i expected a lil more, but over all a good movie. My grandkids seemed to love it."
4,Good for 4 year old,"Things I liked- more realistic bodies (spring ferry has fecund, plush thighs), no ""bad guys"", good for sensitive children. Music was a bit bland. Not a very good plot but fine for kids."
4,Great Fairy Movie,"My daughter loves the Disney Fairies and thoroughly enjoyed this one! The whole family sat and watched it together, and it was nice to watch a good Disney movie we all could enjoy!"
5,My daughter enjoyed the movie,"The story line was great! Being able to find a sister that you didn't know about coupled with a tragedy. My wife thought that it was a little dark for my daughter (being 4 years old); however, I ended up watching it with my wife from the beginning and felt that the story line was appropriate. This isn't as dark as the Treasure Hunt -- which my daughter did get a little scared at one point.I'd recommend watching this during the day just to be safe. My daughter tends to dream about the last thing that she saw. So, we had her watch a fun uplifting show that she is use to. Otherwise, I'd definitely recommend it!"
5,Good movie,I bought this movie for granddaughter. She loves all the Tinkerbell movies and always asks for the newest one. She really enjoyed it.
2,Did it really need to have a love story?,I would have given it 3.5 if the movie didn't have the love story of the queen. Why can't a movie made for little girls without romance. It has nice graphics and emphasis on sisterhood.
4,secret of the wings,the grandkids of course love it as all the movies like these they can't wait till the next one they watch it over and over
3,Another Fairy story,"The littles like it. I don't see much of educational, moral, intellectual, etc value...but eye candy is fun once in a while, I suppose."
5,Daughter loves it,My daughter loves anything fairy related so they could have animated snakes in a fairy costume and my daughter would love it.
3,Cute sequel,"I must note that the story has a more grown up feel compared to the previous ones (especially the very first). A friend responded that it is appropriate, given the children who viewed the first tinker bell movie should now be in their ""tweens"" or even teens. Graphics are incredible and colors are vibrant as expected from the tinkerbell series. (No backstage featurettes though)"
5,Nice movie,I watched this on my new Kindle fire HD and it was amazing! A very good family film. I would recommend it!
5,More Adventures for Tinkerbell,"As a 60 year young lover of cartoons, I was pleased with Tinkerbell's new adventure. The movie has good pacing, and I surmise would keep the younger viewer entertained. I remain glad that Disney decided to present this icon with her own starring role and adventures."
5,Visually Stunning,"My granddaughter and I watched this movie together. It is beautifully done, with an appealing cast of characters. I absolutely loved this movie!"
4,Good for my girls,"My girls, ages 3 and 4.5 both did this movie. they asked to watch it almost daily for the first few weeks after they opened it from Christmas. As a dad, I found it mildly entertaining. I dont think it was the strongest movie of the Fairy franchise, but over all it had a good plot, some emotionally pulling moments, and lacked the typical Disney kill off of a mom.I would recommend this movie to other parents of fairly loving girls."
3,Not as good as Lost Treasure,"While cute, and in some odd way about climate change, I was a little disappointed that magic solved all the problems in this movie. I LOVED Tinkerbell and the Lost Treasure for it's messages of a) bad things can happen when you lose your temper and b) your brain and not magic can solve your problems. This movie, however, is mostly magic. I think there was a real missed opportunity at the end to have Tinkerbell live with the results of her decision and thus be able to go live with her sister. Would have made a powerful ending but it's a Disney movie so magic rules. And it could have had a little more about fairy activities and climate change and jet streams - through a little science in with the movie and they wouldn't even notice. So, not my favorite Tinkerbell, but not bad.( I loved the way Dewey channeled that old SNL character of Father Guido Sarducci - made us old folks laugh.)"
4,Tinkerbell - Secret of the Wings,My children and their friends loved this movie. Tinkerbell wanted to visit the Winter World...and have her sparkly wings again. Cute story
4,I liked it.,You have to love Tink. She reminds me of my daughter. Sometimes nosey but always means well when she gets into trouble.
5,Cute movie,I would watch this movie again. I watched it with my son and he told me not to tell anyone.
2,"Cute Movie, but DVD skips out of the box","First off, my kids and I loved this movie. We now have all four Tink movies, and we will probably buy the next one as well. No violence, easy to relate to, beautiful imagery, and enough little things for both children and adults to enjoy.Unfortunately, the quality of the discs is sub-par. I can't speak for the Blu-Ray discs, as we don't actually own a blu-ray player, but the DVD skipped seven times right out of the box. Luckily, the digital copy is perfectly fine, and the skipping itself was slight instead of jarring. But for a brand new movie to do this is completely unacceptable."
3,Secret of the Wings,"I got it for my 3year old granddaughter and she seemed to like it. So guess it was okay. I have seen other children's shows that I have thought were better, though."
5,Fascinada,"A mi hija le encanto esta película desde que la vio en el cine, ha sido hasta el momento la unica que la ha mantenido interesada por ello decidi adquirirla en BR para que la disfurte las veces que quiera. Se las recomiendo ampliamente"
3,1 out of 3 of us would watch it again...,"My youngest (9) would watch it again. My older child said: It was kind of depressing that Disney made a book series about these fairies and then totally messed up the movies.It wasn't terrible, didn't have violent scenes or images, or any scenes that were scary like some other Disney movies."
4,Beautiful,"The movie is great, the story is sweet and the visual is awesome. If you like any of the other Tinker Bell movies, you'll love this one too."
5,Good movie,I would recommend it specially for little girl. She has three movie elated to this one and my grandchild watch them over and over again.
5,Great movie,"This is a great little movie for the young and old alike. I am the old, and very much enjoyed it. A little kid in everyone!"
5,Another Disney movie for adults,Beautiful graphics and effects. Just worth watching it for that. But this one is deep layered with hidden meaning-- great for adults to watch too.
5,Granddaughter Loved it,"A fun happy movie for girls. Grandsons could care less, but girls like this one. Remember this at Christmas! Nice!"
5,Arrived in fast excellent condition,Although this is for my daughter for Christmas and haven't opened it yet. It came speedy and with slip cover for the 3D version. I cannot complain.
5,fun movie,"My two BOYS, 7 and 3, really liked this movie. We love all the Tinkerbell movies, they are well done with great stories and genuinely funny moments."
3,Painfull to sit through,"Sacherine and annoying just what every little girl loves. My 13 y/o daughter is a fan still and was glued to it, as an adult I found it difficult to stomach but then it was not made for me was it? if your kid is a fan thay will love it."
1,secret of the wings,"never read it or seen the movie, it must be good though as most Disney movies are pretty good and worth watching."
3,Ending???,"what did I miss??? where is the ending?? Did they all die , frozen in the tree forever...... anyone let me know........ bad ending"
4,Secret Of The Wings,"Great story line for young children. I bought this for my grabddaughter who is 4 yrs. old, she loved it."
4,Good family movie,My family and I really liked it. It kept my son entertained which is usually hard to do. Movie was a little short though.
4,Pixie Hollow Games isn't included...,"At least at the 19.96 dollars dvd version, the 'Pixie Hollow Games' movie isn't included. Only the two music clips from the main songs on the movie. Besides that, the movie is great and highly recommended to everyone. I mean this one:Secret of the Wings"
4,Overall good movie,"This movie is typical of most Disney series in that it contradicts previous titles (as per this movie Winter fairies are forbidden from entering the ""warm"" side, but in the original TinkerBell there are clearly Winter fairies in attendance at her arrival and a snowflake is placed as a talent item... Also the Minister of Winter makes an appearance or two and she doesn't exist in this movie, being replaced by the Lord of Winter...). This is enough to bother me, but not my daughter (4 years old) yet. She was upset by the missing scenes, the pictures on the cover of the movie are misleading as some of the 'screenshots' never happen.But this is still a good movie and has entertained us and my daughter loves it :)"
4,Perfect Gift for Girls,Ordered this for my 9-year-old grandaughter. She and her 6-year-old sister totally enjoy it. A perfect gift for little girls!
5,Great entertainment for all,The whole family really enjoy it. We didn't have high expectations and we ended up very really liking it. Same characters from other tinker bell movies . Well done.
4,Fun Movie,"I ""dad"" watched them movie with my two daughters and found myself enjoying the movie. Fun movie, great for some family time together"
4,Cute Movie,"This Tinkerbelle movie is a hit with my daughters, they love it. As with all Tinkerbelle movies, they aren't smash hits, just cute movies for kids to enjoy."
4,"Disney, Secret of the Wings","Disney, Secret of the WingsMae WhitmanHow do I rate this product?Like itDisney, Secret of the WingsMae WhitmanHow do I rate this product?Like it"
4,"A very interesting and fun read, especially for WoW nerds","I played WoW a lot a few years ago . I always wanted to know more about the story line, although this doesn't affect WoW a huge amount , it is a good starting place. The kindle version would often combine 2-3 words , which would make you double take what you have read. One thing I really didn't like about the book was the way in which the characters would ""forget"" very key items. I feel as though the author should have made a more creative way for the items to out of the characters grasp. Other than those very small errors I have to say it was one of my favorite books that I have read. I strongly recommend this book for any fantasy lovers"
3,First fantacy book,"I haven't yet finished the book. But as an avid reader I find it mediocre. It has a simplistic plot. Character relationships are predictable. I felt more descriptive detail could have been utilized considering, from the gaming aspect, I found the varying regions quite enjoyable as I traveled through on my quests. The scenery and animals encountered made the game a colorful and inviting place to stay. The book, is blah."
2,"Good as backstory for WoW, that's it.","This book is useful if you are looking to see some important events and characters from the Warcraft universe. Also if you are a fan of typical, overdone, fantasy stories you may also enjoy this.I found that I was bored of it by about halfway through, but I continued because I wanted to see what happened to the Demon Soul.After reading this book and the War of the Ancients series I can honestly say, I don't like Richard A. Knaak's writing. I know he is well respected author, but his style is just not my cup of tea."
4,Not bad. I enjoyed it.,"I have read all of the WoW books I could get my hands on... and I have enjoyed almost all of them. This one was fun and a nice brainless read. I think I liked most WoW books so much because I spent 5 years of my life playing the game. Now, I'd rather read the lore than play so I find the novels a fun break from some of the more serious reading I do.I highly recommend reading this book in the correct order in the series to really know what the heck is going on... there's a lot of time jumping around..."
3,Light Reading,"An okay book. I would recommend it to people looking for more background into the World of Warcraft, but not to people looking for a great fantasy novel."
3,Conflictions and Two-Dimensional,"This story wasn't bad, but it was far from good. Lore is directly conflicted as Deathwing is said to be in Outlands at the time in history, but appears on Azeroth in the story. You can't tell when this story takes place in the timeline either. Some parts have a setting placed before the Second War, while other parts have it noted as during. And the final straw for me was the inclusion of Knaak's own original character, Rhonin. His name alone is a dead giveaway to the type of character he is - aside for being two dimensional, shallow, and overly powerful for his own good. Its not a bad read, but far from compelling, thoughtful, and action packed."
4,Dang this is a addicting book,This book is super addicting i spent like 6 hours a day reading this book. Richard A. Knaak makes the plot so suspenseful like when Rohnin (the main character) enters the dragonqueens prison and ends up getting himself a prisoner as well when he gets caught caught by Nekros the commander of the orcs. Also another suspenful moment was when the Rhonin and two other of his allies got stuck when the golem hit the roof and everything colapsed but i won't tell you how Rohnin saved him and his allies. So you have to read the book to see what its really about.
5,Fantastic Anime!,"I was ecstatic when I discovered this series had been licensed, since it's my favorite anime of all time. It's a magical girl series, but it's better than any other magical girl anime I've seen -- for one thing, there's no filler in the series! The plot is also fantastic, and the characters gripping and likable. The art style is nice, the series is filled with wonderful costumes and gorgeous bishounen, and the soundtrack is great, especially the opening song. The story is both touching and humorous, and it draws your attention and keeps it. I highly recommend buying this anime. :)"
5,Looking for a great anime look no further!!!,"OMG..this series was an awesome one. It is about these seven leafe knights that took an oath to protect the leafe of earth. But now the Princess of Disaster has escaped they must find the Pretear to stop her. Once they find her there are up and downs and even an unexpected surprise in the middle of the series that you would have not thought to happen. If you want an anime that has laughter, saddness, betrayal, and more look no further. This is one of my all time fav."
3,Not that it's pretentious or anything...,"Just wanted to say that I think this book is great, a pretty in depth look into the genre, specifically when you consider it's only 130 pages. I like that the author address the socio-political influences of the genre, in particular bring up comparisons to Karl Marx's Communist Manifesto and Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection. What I didn't care for is the author's verbose use of language. It reads very slowly, as one practically needs a dictionary to decipher what the author is saying. Just be warned that this is far from light reading on the horror genre."
4,The Ar of Calligraphy,"An excellent reference as well as a ""How to"" manual. I can and will recommend this book to beginners and to people who have been practicing the art for a long time.FKA Heidelberg, Germany"
3,Beautiful but......,"As with all Dorling Kindersley products the book is beautifully produced and laid out. However it does has some flaws. The style of the text is somewhat 'strained' and reads like a text book which doesn't not seem,in my mind to fit in with the usual user-friendly DK style. Secondly there appears to be a section of the book missing, in that the book leaps from a rather cursory look at what is required straight to the different styles, without discussing any basic techniquesof penmanship(penpersonship?) Further more I use the word 'cursory' since there is no mention of INK! How can a book about calligraphy not discuss types and colours of ink, gouache etc! I would suggest that the revised version of this 'practical guide' (sic) ought to consider this major oversight!"
5,WOW!!!!,"So many artist in one complete set. Plus a video to go with it. If you love gospel music, it's a must have for a great price. 3 Thumbs up."
3,Adequate but outdated review of medical imagining,"The second page of my copy of this book states:Reprinted 1995, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2003This is pretty much the same text published in 1988 (after corrections)So:Fuzzy 80's CT scan illustrationsNothing on fat suppression, or more modern image acquisition sequences in the ""Nuclear Magnetic Imaging"" chapterDefinitely no mention of harmonic ultrasoundMany anachronistic references to 'future technological improvements'I am not sure whether the publisher's reluctance to update this book represents apathy or avarice, but the failure to more frequently revise a textbook in such a rapidly changing area relegates this book from serious consideration as a primary textbook.Some chapters are quite clear and complete (for example X-ray) but overall the writng style is a little obtuse.In summary- some good chapters but outdated, stylistically hum-drum and superceded by the numerous other texts in this area."
1,Unacceptable radio static,"I bought the Young Micro 5-in-1 Universal iPod player multifunction, so that I could listed to my iPod nano, over my car's speakers. It has a charger, from the cigarette lighter, and an FM radio transmitter, for transmitting to the radio, which then plays the iPod music, to the speakers. Unfortunately, the radio static, from the 5-in-1 transmitter, is so bad, that, even over road noise, the music quality is unacceptable. My advice: don't buy this product!"
5,Very good!,"I like this dvd a lot. You can easliy pick and chose the routines you want to do. There are 6-ten minute routines. 2 for abs, 2 for legs/butt, 2 for arms. If you love Tracy Anderson's workouts-you will love this as well. Very complimentary moves. James cues in voice-over style. My only complaint is that he almost cues too much. The moves are great and so is his form-so I can overlook this! The music and production value and scenery are top-notch!"
1,For uncritical Yes groupies only,"As several reviewers have astutely noted, the sound is emasculated, the performances tame and Jon Anderson is so much up front and more annoying than usual. I agree with his sentiments, but his smug goody-two-shoes guru of PEACE! LOVE! HAPPINESS! demeanor is purely peurile. It's excusable when not excessive and the band is crankin' -- but here it seems Messrs. Wakeman, Howe, Squire & White are mainly window dressing for the highly enlightened, inspiring, mercurial Jon Anderson. I've seen Yes at least a half dozen times from '75 on. This represents the band at a nadir; perhaps they're just too old and creaky to blast off like they used to."
1,delayed until August,"According to Image Entertainment, who is producing this DVD, the release has been delayed *again* to August 9th."
1,Bull****,"Great show, but if they keep delaying they deserve poor reviews. There is no legitimate reason to wait until less than a week before the already delayed release date to announce yet another delay. This is very very poor irresponsible management."
2,NO WORK < NO PLAY,"Was a different REGION < and did not play in USA machine . So , I didnt hear it . I returned it ."
3,Sadly beautiful...,"Yeah, I thought maybe I had the wrong audio setting, but as I see from other reviews, this DVD is poorly mixed and/or recorded. Beautiful cinematography, and them balloons, although commented upon poorly in forums elsewhere, don't look bad with modern lighting techniques. Other than that, it is unfortunate to see such slowed down and arthritic performances, dulled I guess by time or fatigue (Yessongs, although poorly recorded and subject to the technical vagaries of the day, has real balls to the wall performances). Many signature parts in songs are either flubbed or just dumbed down (re:Squire in ""yours is no disgrace""). Acoustic set, which I was sure I'd hate, was actually pleasant. Very nice to have a full show over two discs."
2,what were they thinking.,"OK ,ever since Bruford,squire ,anderson etc blew me away with ""america"" on a K-TEL compilation I have welcomed anything by the band.This half hearted attempt..first half was enjoyable,but I guess they were so worn out by the end of the half they had to move to an accoustic set.What a let down.Take a tip guys and watch other bands ie TOTO do an anniversary concert ala Amsterdam live."
2,TERRIBLE MIX,"Don't understand how folks can say this is so good. Besides Anderson being mixed way to high (which can be annoying - always looked at his voice as another instrument - to be blended in with everything else) - the rest of the mix is very mushy. One of those 'you can hear everything - but you can't hear anything' mixes. Drums almost non-existant.The performance is good. But if you want a really great sounding live performance of YES - the live at Montreaux DVD is it. Other than the fact that the for the first half of the show the camera never focuses on Squire (weird) the sound is almost flawless. The drums sound particularly good in Montreaux - and overall, it's all good - way better than Tsongas."
4,Please Keep the Camera Still for Just a Moment or Two,"Simply, hands-down, one of the greatest bands ever and this was a truly terrific show. Having said that, this video could have been great but is absolutely horrible in one key area; the picture editing. The video's picture jumps from view, to view, to view rarely spending more than two or three seconds on any one camera. I get dizzy watching it. Good grief, I want to watch these incredible musicians play their instruments. It's as though the editor was either overzealous or had a very short attention span."
5,WOW! Incredible!,"For those that are complaining about the sound, you need to learn how to adjust the sound settings on the DVD. This is one of the best sounding and best produced concert DVD's I have seen to date. Simply incredible!"
5,Return To Hear Your Wonderous Story,"Yes can still enlighten us with their idealistic nature while electrifying fans and listeners alike with their musical craft. The first half of this show has the band rocking out with power jams, especially on great classics like ""South Side Of The Sky,"" and ""Your Is No Disgrace."" The second half contains some extended plays too, and Wakeman's keyboard craft is still very distinguished, but the band offers a different spin on some of their classics with a slower, acoustic-like play on ""Roundabout,"" and ""Owner Of A Lonely Heart,"" and they pull it off. As a major musical force that helped to exemplify progressive rock back in the 70's, Yes are a classic but everlasting presence as they celebrate their love and ritual of music within the 21st century."
3,Abbreviated version of the DVD,"It still gets 3 stars for the choice of material to be included, however be warned that picking this up as Amazon Unbox, it's only 70 minutes long. The DVD is 170 minutes! I'm glad I used my Amazon $15 credit for Unbox, otherwise I'd be extremely unhappy.As for Yes themselves, one of the interesting thing with this band as they age is how they hone the material. You rarely see them play a song the same way twice, which is a good thing.Let's all hope they can get their act together to actually record & tour again in the next year or two. In the meantime, check out the new Yes-related band Circa, featuring Billy Sherwood, Alan White, Tony Kaye, & Jimmy Iovine!"
3,Nice video but what's up with the sound?,"I saw YES twice during this tour. The first time in San Jose (the second night of the tour) and the other time in LA (last night of the tour)so I was keen on getting a DVD of the show. Early in the year bootleg DVD's began appearing all over Ebay, so I got one. And while the video wasn't the best, the sound quality was ""very good"". I DO know that this DVD was delayed and delayed again. And now I know why. The sound is messed up - defective. The video shots are all the best. But the sound is flat and dull - a disappointment - Find a bootleg on Ebay instead - I know that ""Classic Rock"", the people who produced this DVD, had to release the thing to recoup their investment but it's a dud."
1,Not The Sound Man's Fault,"After reading some of these reviews about the bad audio on this dvd, please note that the tracks recorded live from the show are then re-mixed and mastered in a studio. Therefore, the studio producer and or the band itself is really to blame. After listening to a clip on the band's website, I tend to agree with your complaints."
3,"Great show, audio good most of time, bad at others.","The acoustic set is worth the the DVD. Most of the rest of the show is great but at time's Jon's vocals are so loud you can't hear the rest of the group. ""And You and I"" sounds the worst. At one point it sounds like the entire mix, except the vocals, are run through some type of limiter/compression. The whole mix of the DVD set is kind of small sounding. Sounds like it was taken from a board mix that they just couldn't get right."
3,We waited all this time for this bad audio mix!?!,"I saw this 2004 tour twice (Ft. Laud. and MSG) and both shows were plaged by a weak and underpowered sound system. Jon's voice was way louder than the rest of the instrumentation and the drums were barely audible most of the times. And this DVD sounds the same. There is a terrible imbalance in the sound mix. When Jon sings I have to turn the audio down, and then turn it back up for the instrumental sections. And you still can't barely hear drummer Alan White. Most of the times the instruments sound tiny. Even the much maligned House of Blues DVD had a BIG SOUND.It is a good, but not great, show but it simply pales next to the Symphonic DVD."
4,VERY GOOD DVD,"There some excellent performances on this dvd and the atomsphere of it is is very positve. I think the best performance on the dvd is rythem of love...others are going for the one, show me, bluesy version of roundabout, awaken although all are good to very good. I suppose Starship Trooper could have been better but it's still ok. Mind Drive is another high light but it is split into two different parts the second half played after south side of the sky...it is an outstanding performance of it but I don't know why it is split up because the ritual isn't split up despite it's length."
4,I loved it (like all others),I think this book is another one of Spring Song's excellent book. It demonstrates family relations (how Erica relates to her Mom). I think that any young person should read this book. Even my sister loved it!
5,Tracy Kidder is a great writer,Anyone who is thinking of building a house on their own should read this book.
2,Dated and cumbersome,"I remember when this came out and was a big hit. Gave it to a friend who was building a house, and now it seems a bit dated and cumbersome."
2,Disappointed,"I have enjoyed all the other Tracy Kidder books I've read (Among Schoolchildren, Old Friends, Home Town, My Detachment, Mountains Beyond Mountains), so it was with a heavy heart that I bailed out on this one after 70 pages. Kidder does a good job in some respects (particularly with his character sketches), but I just couldn't get behind the story. After a period in which I've been reading book after book dealing with serious and wrenching issues -- anti-intellectualism in America, child abuse, destructive religious zealotry, etc. -- I just couldn't see the drama in waiting to see whether a yuppie couple gets the window treatments they want on their huge, custom-built house in the country. Maybe it's just me, or my current mood."
3,"Like its subject, Kidder's story evolves, but w/ problems.","As an architecture student, I found Kidder's story to be both informative and depressing. It should be required reading for anybody interested in pursuing a career in designing or building (or, for that matter, having a new house built). However, as a student, it was a real eye opener to see what it takes to actually have a house built. Kidder spends a major portion of the book explaining the project's design, materials, time involved, and above all, costs. That's the informative part! All the personalities and egos constitute the depressing part! Is this really the American Dream?"
2,"Worth skimming, not reading","From the very beginning, it is clear that the house project is a project doomed to difficulty--the builders were breaking ground without having a clear design, a price point, and a contract.What I took away from this book was the absolute necessity of having *EVERYTHING* in writing. If Bill (the architect) had provided completed drawings early in the process, the estimating would have been more accurate, there would have been fewer confrontations, and some of the change orders could have happened before the building started, meaning when it's still cheap and easy to make changes. Of course, that would have taken away from the drama of the story.Any project manager would have cringed all the way through this book--it was bound to be a train wreck from the very beginning."
2,i'd rather have a root canal,"This is obviously well written, but oh, what a bore! I HATE having to deal with contractors in real life. I don't want to read about the trials and tribulations of building a house. I appreciate the character development, but if this had been framed under a different topic, I would have finished it."
5,It's not just a nice story about building a house,"I read this book when it came out thirteen years ago and I enjoyed every minute.In this book, Tracy Kidder describes the process and personalities involved with building a new home, but it's more than that. Like his ""Soul of a New Machine"", it chronicles what it's really like to be caught in the middle of a major project. Even someone who hasn't built a home from scratch or developed a new computer system will gain an basic knowledge of the topic and an appreciation for what it takes to do something really big."
5,A HIDDEN GEM,"I HAD THIS ON VINYL WAY BACK IN 1973. I THOUGHT FOR THE HECK OF IT I WOULD CHECK IF THIS WAS AVAILABLE ON CD. IT WAS!!! THIS WAS THEN MADE TOP PRIORITY TO ORDER THIS RATHER OBSCURE, WHO ARE THESE GUYS?, KIND OF BANDS. THE SOUND QUALITY IS AWESOME & I AM VERY PROUD THAT THEY COME FROM CANADA. IF YOU ARE LIKE MYSELF & ENJOY GEE-TAR THEN YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. THE OTHER REVIEWER FROM FLORIDA IS 100% CORRECT IN HIS ASSESSMENT. BY THE WAY WALTER ROSSI WENT SOLO AFTERWARDS & DOES HAVE A FEW ALBUMS AVAILABLE THRU AMAZON. CHECK IT OUT!!!!"
1,"It is big, I'll admit that...","A massive work. I appreciate the amount of work and research that went into compiling this stuff. But it is organized in an almost completely useless way. Unless you know exactly what you're looking for, you will be very unlikely to find anything in this rambling 900 plus page doorstop. I was doing research for a script I'm working on. Well the book's index is arranged alphabetically. Almost completely useless.Want to know about specific folklore? Forget it. Unless you know the title of the book, movie or person, you're screwed.There are much better ways to learn about Vampires. This is a reference book for someone who already knows exactly what to look for. And once you know that, you don't need this book at all.Waste of money and time."
3,"Excellent reference, if a bit sloppy.","This book is definitely worth having for any vampire afficionado, but it has its flaws: notably, that the quality of the writing is spotty. Some of the entries are extremely well-written, others look as if the writers were not native English speakers (and they may well not have been, but that's what EDITORS are for!) Mostly, if there are any flaws in the information, they are beyond my poor ability to spot (I seem to remember noticing one or two, but can't remember any specifics at this point.)The book is useful, but could certainly use a bit of polishing."
4,Encyclopedia of the Undead,"A friend of mine had borrowed this book from our public library and was on the verge of refusing to return it she loved it so much! I went cheap when purchasing it as a gift, and chose a well used version, but it was still a great purchase all the same! I wish they had been a little more detailed in the damages of the book (as I did purchase it new), but luckily the book wasn't as worn as we had expected."
3,Thorough,"Well this book has quite a bit on vampires.. but mostly it has information related to vampires, like what actor played ""Blackula"", information on Batman, Actors of all kinds that have played vampires in movies, TOO MUCH on Bram Stoker's Dracula, Vlad, Elizabeth Bathory, etc.. But considering how much is in here, you'll probably still find lot's of interesting stuff and since it's an encyclopedia format, you can find things with ease."
5,Great even if you don't know much about the subject.,"I loved this book a lot. It is one fo those books you can just pick up and flip to any random page and find something fun to read. I don't know anything about Vamipres but this book is still interesting. Overall, a buy, and a great gift for those strage relatives you have to buy something for. :)"
1,Wow,"I was looking for something different and just checked out the back cover to see what it was all about. Seemed intresting and saw that Angel of the Buffyverse lore was featured. I decided to stop and read it real quick.I cannot recommend a book that could easily fix it's faults, of which there are apparently many. I got about a paragraph into the book. I stopped when it said the character of Angel was from Greece. Not only wrong, but for some reason this word, Greece, was in bold. I decided that I would not continue reading to see what other screw ups lie within the pages, not when apparently the fact checkers of the book cannot be bothered to call at least and entry level Angel fan, who would know the correct information.I wouldn't but much stoke in this book, it's filled with information, but like wikipedia, how much of it is actually credible?"
2,Kind of a bit crap,"This is not a book for anyone with a college education. Although there is a lot of trivia, the book is quickly outdated, as it depends most on its account of media.The book also does not produce what I would call an Objective view of anything. It is distinctly Western-biased and dumbed down for its thought-readership.Everything is also somewhat parrotted, if you understand my meaning."
1,A mess,"I'm sorry, but I can't give any more than one star to a book where the first WORD is misspelled."
3,Not as good or as complete as I had hoped,"While the photos and drawings are great, the organization is good, and a strong attempt has been made to be inclusive and correct, I found several errors in the book, oddly about television more than anything else. Also, while I am, in fact, a storyteller for a Vampire: the Masquerade game each summer for a great group of players/actors, I found it odd just how much information from this gaming system was in the book (and also with errors) compared to other entries. Yes, the game is popular but it is just a game. Also I was disappointed that the movie guide is not a separate book. The other ""lists"" were great however. It isn't really a book you can enjoy reading straight through, is any encyclopedia? But if you know a term or an actor or director or writer, you can easily look them up here."
2,A noble effort that failed.,"This second edition was Melton's chance to correct the many factual errors in the first edition. Not only are most of those mistakes still intake, but the new edition contains plenty of new ones! Again, this would be a great book, but if you can't rely on the information in one entry, then ALL of them must be suspect, rendering the book useless as a reference on vampires in popular culture and folklore!"
3,Lots of Mistakes,I received this book as a gift and was excited to read it. The first page I flipped to had a mistake...a pretty big one at that (crediting Anna Paquin in a photo when it wasn't her at all - it was of another character from True Blood). It just made me wonder how many other mistakes are in there. Most of them were related to TV shows - which are very easy to reasearch. I'm sure it will be an interesting read regardless. It just annoyed me.
5,Great Text Great Photos,"This book contains everything you need to know about vampires and ""the living dead"". It was quite a tome. I especially enjoyed the many, many photographs which were reproduced very well It's a shame that this master work is out of print. All I can say is, in the words of Nesfaratu Olaf, Oing!"
5,"A ""must read""","This book is a real contribution to existing knowledge of ""unconventional flying objects"". Mr. Hill in this book, removes a lot of the mystery behind the technology of the ufos reported in the past. He takes each aspect of the characteristics of these flying craft and provides a thorough scientific analysis/breakdown of what is seen or reported. You needn't have a great knowledge of math in order to follow the explanations he provides and he acknowledges that many readers don't. Then, he provides a Summary and Conclusions that wraps it all up. With the technology laid out as Mr. Hill as done in this book, we shouldn't be that far off from creating this technology ourselves - it's all there! We should all be grateful to Mr. Hill's daughter for making sure that this work was published after his death - Mr. Hill would be proud, as we are grateful."
5,No giggle factor here.,If you have any interest in this subject I give this book my highest possible recommendation. Author makes an extremely compelling case case for further study.
5,Outstanding book on this subject,After having read dozen of books related to this topic i found P. Hill's analysis very accurate and well-documented.This expert explains with great details the physics behind this phenomenon.Unconventional Flying Objects: A Scientific Analysis is in my opinion a reference book.
3,okay,This movie was purchased as a gift for my father. This movie really brings back old memories and highly recommends it.
2,Sound is So Bad Almost Inaudible!,"Ok now I am afraid to try any other Our Gang DVDs! No one mentions how poor the sound is, so that it it almost impossible to understand what is being said! This made this DVD worthless in my opinion."
3,Not bad for the money,"The service from the seller was great, but the battery is mediocre at best. It works fine at first, but it dies off in only a few months."
3,Meh,I love Baroque music (other than Bach). This disc is a little dry. I find it to be a slapped together collection of Telemann works and not a coherent collection. Still looking for a good Telemann disc.
1,Info About Shockwave For Dummies,Ihis all poopy and smelly! It is dum. I didit lern atything frum iit
3,bootleg,"my comments refer to the bootleg copy i have had for years; it is mostly performance and very little interviews if any; however, the performances are in color and black and white and the sound quality is vintage 1968-1974. I hope the release next week has better sound and video; otherwise, i'll keep the bootleg and sit this one out"
1,complete waste of time,"I detest misleading titles and this is certainly one of them. ""Mick Taylor Years"" yeah, right. Nothing in this dvd is worth watching or listening to, at all."
4,"Very good, but a bit short.",The good thing about this CD is that it really helps sleep! Both my wife and I sleep very fitfully. In an act of desperation we ordered this CD. The fantastic news is that now we actually sleep better! We have it on repeat the whole night. The music is very calming. We have it on when we read and let us relax us gently. The only negative thing I have on it is that it is a bit short.
2,Not good for continuous play,"The music is very nice. Unfortunately, however, I wanted to use it during my daughter's naptime to block street noise, and the CD starts out with a loud percussion sound, so she would wake up every time the CD started at the beginning again."
2,Sleeping too long,"The sound is nice, but I prefer many tracks on a CD rather than one long sound. I find it gets monotonous...not sleepy, but tedious....too long."
4,It Takes Awhile,"Mike Park has consitently made great records for as far back as I can remember. This album took awhile to hit me. It's not as instantly catchy as ""The Chinkees Are Coming"" but it's every bit as good. I belive that this one is well worth your investment and give it a couple listens."
5,run away,run away deserves 5 stars...that song rules and i have only listend to the demo of it...its comin in the mail and i cant wait..their other albums rule..also check out skankin pickle and the bruce lee band...also mike park stuff.... peace
4,Prompt delivery for World Languages (Como Se Dice?),My daughter needed this audio CD quickly because it did not come with another purchase that we made online as expected. The price was good and it was timely in its arrival. I would recommend this vendor
5,Spanish Book,The book came in very good condition and with all material included. A few scratches on cover but overall great buy!
5,Still Groovin,"Jimmy Cliff is an international reggae star. His forty year career has seen world tours, hits upon hits, and Grammy's. Amongst all of this its' surprising this record slipped throught the cracks when it was released in the early 90's. Well, now it is receiving the notice it should be receiving. This record is bold and diverse and includes such artists like the OK Jazz Band. Another excellent record bu one of the Reggae masters."
5,A Truly Original Detective Story,"From the very first page I knew I had found an intriguing book. Nothing is as it seems in the world Ms. Carton has created. It is a wild ride through a tangle lies and intrigue with a detective who is unstoppable in his quest for the truth. It is a tale of a loyal friend who is also a detective with an investigative style all his own. A violent killer, Florida's sultry summer, drugs and conspiracy all combine to make this a page-turner that leaves you anxiously awaiting Ms. Carton's next book."
3,"Great Sinmon & Garfunkel songs, poor remastering","Great songs and plenty of them, but why couldn't they sound as good as my old recordings of same. They would have been ESSENTIAL, but not for me. I expected great sound. Are the other Sony/Columbia ESSENTIALS so poor in sound? The CD was bought from Amazon"
2,"Jeez, what a big let-down","Look at all this live crap. Why would they do this? I agree with some of the other reviews that state that ""The Best of Simon and Garfunkel"" is by far, a better collection. It may not have ""Keep The Customer Satisfied"" and ""Baby Driver"" but, if you were a true Simon and Garfunkel fan, you would have the ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" CD, anyway. And to me, those are the only two great tracks missing from their single CD of ""The Best of Simon and Garfunkel""I have their box set anyway, but ""The Best of Simon and Garfunkel"" is a great CD to have in your carousel CD player to shuffle with other 60's folk artists.To have ""The Best of Simon and Garfunkel"" and Paul Simon's ""Greatest Hits, etc."" on CD is a very tight collection of the absolute best of Simon and Garfunkel. Art Garfunkel's ""All I Know"" is easy to get as a cheap MP3."
4,The Essential Simon & Garfunkle,Very nice to hear them again on CD format. Nice mellow tunes. I wished I had ordered it on the Essential 3.0 CD. Thank You!
4,"Overall, a very good collection","This collection contains more than 35 songs which include just about all of the best known ones and quite a few lesser known but good ones, like el Condor Pasa. Most of them are the studio recordings, especially the better known ones like Sounds of Silence, and they sound very good. I think overall it is very good, especially for the price.A few minor areas of concern: First, there are some live tracks which sound better in their studio versions. I am not sure why they include live cuts when the studio ones are certainly available. Second, the packaging is cheap - I had to break the case to get at CD Number 2. I had this problem with another of the ""Essential"" sets, so I think they could do a better job here. Finally, I am not sure why they included a few songs; for example, I find ""Old Friends"" and ""A Most Peculiar Man"" depressing. Overall, howerer, I think this a very good collection and is certainly worth the money!"
4,Almost perfect...,"Although the CD arrived on time, the jewel case had 2 cracks in it...one on front, one on back. The CD was not affected, but stiffer packaging needs to be applied when mailing."
4,Terrific CD,"I received this CD in a timely manner, and have enjoyed it very much. It brings back alot of nice memories for people who are in my age group."
1,Hippies are gonna love this one,"Great, just what we need. A 2-album disc set that features the overrated, introspective music of two of the most annoying hippies alive. Didn't these guys break up because one was jealous that the other guy had hair? In any case, I've heard almost all these songs and they're about as boring as all get-out. The only tune worth anything is ""Bridge Over Troubled Water,"" and even that got overplayed to death by commercial radio.I'm telling you, if you want to discover true hippie music, check out Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Grateful Dead or Bon Jovi. At least all those hippies managed to rock out at times!! These guys just strum their acoustic guitars like stoned losers - which they are!!What can I say? If you're a hippie, run, don't walk, to discover these ""masterful"" songs. Hey, you might ""dig"" it, man. Otherwise, steer far clear from this travesty on wheels.By the way, is Halen coming back with Roth this December? That's the rumor, I'm told.LaTeR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"A new collection from ""Old Friends"".","Well, the ""Greatest Hits"" was recently improved upon by the ""Best of Simon and Garfunkel"", and now that gets the big upgrade here. A great 2-disc collection that these two deserve as much as anyone. It includes every single song that was on both previous ""hits"" albums, and at least 13 more. The biggest songs are here like ""The Sound of Silence"", ""The Boxer"", and ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"", as well as ""I Am A Rock"", ""Homeward Bound"", and ""El Condor Pasa (If I Could)"". I'm really happy to see both ""Bleecker Street"" and ""Sparrow"" from their debut finally on a collection. Both are great. A handful of songs are live, but most are the originals, and all sound good. If this 2-disc set is not in your budget, I would surely go with the 20 track ""Best of"". Either way, you've got to have ""Mrs. Robinson""."
1,Sony's practical joke,"First of all, don't be fooled by the ""live"" recordings that the back cover shows: they are no prev. unreleased material, they're songs from the ""Live from New York City, 1967"" CD (Sony, 2002).So why would Sony release yet another Greatest hits album with material from just 8 months ago? Simply because S&G are on tour. So if you want a good S&G hits album, buy the one with the 2 guys walking on the beach at dusk. If you want an average live recording album, buy the one from last year. And if you want some really good material, then get The Columbia Studio Recordings 1964-1970 [BOX SET]. Of course you can always buy some unofficial wonderful records elsewhere... But that's another story."
4,Best Yet,"This is my first Simon & Garfunkel CD though I am somewhat familiar with their music. I've been enjoying this set for a few weeks now. My only complaint are the 8 live tracks included. I hate it when live tracks are included in a greatest hits collection. I'd much prefer the original versions. Aside from that minor complain, I'd highly recommend this set. i think it's their only 2 disc greatest hits set. That alone makes it a great purchase for new fans like me.As a bonus the booklet includes original recording and release dates, states the album the track is from and the tracks Billboard ranking."
5,sweet streets hotel,This is one of the nicest things I have ordered on Ebay. It was exactly as described and brand new. My granddaughter is going to love it. Thank-you for making it so easy
4,Super Reader,"Conan's reputation as a thief in Shadizar has grown so much it is starting to cause him problems.As such, he takes a job that offers the possibility of a big score, and ends up saving Karela the Red Hawk a couple of times, and mixed up with sorcerers, necromancers, soldiers, lizard men and more.For a pastiche, a pretty good one."
2,Fun but slight,"Of all the eighties Conan writers, Jordan has the most fun with the character and approaches Howard's style the closest. This first of his Conan novels reads quickly and enjoyable, but it still can't compare to Howard's powerful originals."
2,pretty painful,"ancient demon godwizardway too much personal boring stuff about wizardplodding use of kings army troopsnot ""realistic"" according to self imposed rules of fantasy world---like disjointed parts that explode you suspension of disbeliefcouldn't finish itthe unconquered and fearless are best 2 of these res tare mostly muckpart with demon minion dwarf if totally barfo"
5,jordan-conan books,"I have read the (wot) books and the conan books are what started me on them. This book holds the true meaning of conan and is how they were ment to be written. I think I have read all of his books on conan and this one being longer than the usual short story format still keeps you reading. thanks Robert,,,keep the (wot) books rolling till you wanna finish not cause people rush ya to an ending....lol"
2,Good but song selection needs to be better,Initially heard of Laura Pausini singing with Michael Buble. This album is easy listening but it's as if the people handling her english songs don't quite know which ones are best for her
3,She's been better...,"First of all, Laura is soooo much better in Italian and Spanish!!! Although I do like a few tracks on this cd: Without You, Surrender, I Need Love, If That's Love, and It's Not Goodbye, you can really tell that Laura did not write these songs--especially in ""Love Comes from the Inside""--it just doesn't make any sense!! Everyday is a Monday has the same tune as Il Mio Sbaglio Piu Grande/Un Error de Los Grandes, but the lyrics are completely different and it's better in italian/spanish. It's Not Goodbye also has the same tune as En Ausencia de Ti/In assenza di Te, but I like it about the same in English.My favorite tracks are I Need Love and Without You. I Need Love is just great all over, and Without You is so beautiful you just melt into Laura's voice.If you're thinking about getting this CD, go for it because despite some bad spots it is a good cd, but she is a much stronger singer in Italian/Spanish. Try out some of her other cds, you won't be disappointed!"
3,a little disappointed,"Like other female singers who have tried to make it in the English music market and had some nominal success, Laura shows a slight accent, and doesn't have the power and passion she exhibits when singing in her native language. The two songs here that I enjoyed also happened to be originally released in Italian. I bought this CD to complete my Laura Pausini collection, but I won't be listening to it as much as I will continue listening to her Italian language CDs."
4,Laura Pausini is great - even in English,"I'm partial to Laura's Italian stuff and didn't realize that this particular album is all in English - but she still has a great voice. Even though it is not in her native language, I would encourage any fan of Laura Puasini to not let this album pass by."
5,Surrender!!... simply no other choice!!,"Laura Pausini is one of those rarely performers (not singers) who do everything they commit themselves to do with supreme excellence. She is now beyong the singing scene, she is an absolute performer. All the stars for her and this new and wonderful album... You would never regret buying it."
3,Not as sticky as I hoped,"These were not as sticky as I thought they would be. I post magazine scraps in my sketchbooks and the pages keep coming loose. I thought these were supposed to be stronger than the kids glue, hence the higher price?"
3,Too big and bulky for my needs,"The interior fabric is nylon allowing things to slide around more than I like. This might be a great large backpack for hiking but I was looking for something a little bigger than the Micro-Trekker to carry all of my gear and it is too much. Not a bad product, just too big for me."
4,Excellent Harmonies by two gifted young women.,"It's nice to see this album available on CD after many years unavailability. The harmonies of Lucy and Carly Simon are really pleasant to listen to again. The mastering of the album is very well done.As they grew older, Lucy and Carly went in somewhat different directions but both of their talents are unquestionable.I'm just throwing out a small idea here, and that is to say that a companion piece to this early CD of the Simon Sisters would be interesting to hear with perhaps songs chosen by Carly and Lucy as they sound today.Meantime, enjoy the ""early days"" of the Simon Sisters."
4,Two gals and they're guitars,"Long before she became an award winning singer, Carly and her sister Lucy were a duo named the Simon sisters. Folk was they're genre and children's songs were they're bread and butter. They both sing great and played their guitars well. Nothing extraordinary, it's like I said in the title it's two gals and they're guitars and thats it, no bells and whistles, no drums nothing fancy it's simple Simon.The disc has a large selection of songs to listen to and it's mastered well so that nothing sounds out of place or distorted. For Carly's fans out there it's an easy enough recommendation, but it's nothing that will knock your socks off."
1,Do not buy!,"I have purchased many things on Amazon and this is the only one star I have ever given.The very first use I cooked on medium high and it produced the worse smell I have ever smelled while cooking. The non stick cooked right off and a three inch chunk peeled off. It made my whole first story smokey and ruined the meal. Needless to say,i won't be using that pan again.Do not buy this product!"
1,Not a fan,"I am pretty handy and consider myself a good cook, but didn't like how the poached eggs turned out. Very hard to use and smells like plastic is burning when I use it."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"When they came up, with the word's ""Cheaply Made"", they were thinking of this product. Burned my eggs, on the first try. Really, Don't Waste Your Money"
1,Very unusual film,"The acting was not that great. Maybe they filmed it in a week or two. It was unusual to switch from black and white scenes, then to color, and then back and forth. I found it hard to follow. Very chaotic. I wouldn't really call it science fiction, I am not sure how I would classify it.It is a bit violent. I was disappointed, and could barely watch it."
4,Good Operating System,I find this a pretty good operating system. I find microsoft is getting to expensive. I have been learning kubuntu. It works fine. A few things it lacks but most work just fine. I like the Open Office org a great equal to microsoft office and Free.
3,"i'd like to give this one another .5, but whatever","i have just recently become an enormous steve earle fan...but i don't much care about the material from his early years cavorting around nashville. nashville is exactly what is wrong with this album...considering earle's gravelly, chevy-truck-commercial vocal style, glossy production is the LAST thing he needs. but that's what this is. and while it's hard to keep a good song down (""guitar town,"" for instance, and ""someday""), i have a hard time listening. just doesn't feel right, doesn't feel genuine. that's ok, though, because with my next earle purchase--el corazon--i hit much closer to the mark. i bought this one because, a) it's his debut album, and generally quite highly regarded, and b) one of my wife's favorite songs in the world is ""guitar town"" and the only copy of it she had was on a live album. that live recording, in fact, the only SE album she owned. and i just couldn't in good conscience let that pass."
4,Country with a little rock: good lyrics and nice sound.,"Either heard the title track on the radio or connected to ITunes--I liked the tone of the guitar. Bought the CD and ripped it to AIFF, loseless, and put on my IPod. The sound is good, the lyrics are above average in content--particularly like ""Good 'Ol Boy""--and its just good quality all around."
3,A few good songs,"At the risk of being flamed, I really can't say that this is a 5 star recording. The title track, ""Guitar Town,"" has a lot of verve and crunch to it, and is eminently likeable. Much of the rest is musically interesting and diverse (definitely a ""plus""); however, the lyrics are pretty sophomoric and, at times, really lame (e.g., ""Hillbilly Highway"" and ""Down The Road"").This is not to say it's bad (in which case, I would have rated it much lower). It's just that it's not ""great."" The songs are certainly personal, and sung with emotion and power, but I'd much rather spend an evening with Bob Dylan or John Prine."
3,Gustavo Cires Bodyboarder for hobbie,"The product is fine, but if you want to put on your fins in the water and not before to get in, are difficult to put the leash on, when the waves are coming. But once you can get this obstacle they work fine."
1,"Can't review it, don't have the right ones yet","I received the product only to find that they sent 2 different leash sizes in the pair. One was smaller than the other, so I sent them back to have it replaced...over a week or so ago and have not received any follow up emails or the actual replacement product. Not too good on their quality control for sure, they should make sure that the correct & matching sizes are packaged in their assembly line. Anyway, hope it comes soon.R"
5,Tanystropheus Dinosaur,This is a very cool toy for my son who is now 11 years old and who loves his Tanystropheus. Tanystropheus Carnegie Museum Dinosaur is a very bendable and durable toy and it is very educational to children who loves the prehistoric times. I would highly recommend this toy to all who have an interest in dinosaurs of all kinds.
1,I did not like this CD,"I read the first person's review and was like ok, maybe that person had a bad exsperience with that cd but maybe I will buy it and check it out for my self. I am listening to it right now and I wish that I did not waste my money on this CD. This CD does not have ""My Boo"" on it. Its just have beats on it, barly any words, so basically its just a DJ just making beats through out the whole CD..I wish it had words maybe it would have been better, but it does not. Im giving you great detail because I wish someone before me gave me great detail so I would have not bought this product. I am not knocking their review. But if you are reading this review and you are like me, that love music exspecially 90's early 2000's R&B and Hip Hop now and then..you would not like it. This is my review and I hope this helps you. Because I believe in the truth."
5,AWESOME!,"Now, who's this new kid? I love this CD! Very refreshing. Good music. Wonderful voice. Great for partying. Great for chilling with the ballads. A classic for sure!"
2,was a wonderful gazebo,We loved it. The only problem is the canvas ripped after 2 seasons and the product or replacement is no longer available. Can't find a new canvas to fit
2,My salon must get a higher quality bottle...,"My hairstylist uses this on my hair every time I see her, and it smells great and makes my hair feel great. However, I bought this bottle for my home use and it made my hair feel like straw. Maybe it's the quality of my water, but no other shampoo I've used at home has dried my hair out like this one does. It smells great though. : P"
5,Meditation and creativity,"Sensitive, inspirational and clear about seeing and transforming nature and self through process of conscious observation and contemplation of object and subject."
1,Zen Can't Dance,"While this book is much more personal and revealing, a refreshing change from Loori's other ponderous books, American Zen takes itself too seriously -- at Loori's monastery one feels the ""creative"" has been deleted from their rigidly dense rule book. Case in point, many of the stories contained in the book derive from the period prior to Loori's zen training thirty years earlier . The message: If you want to dance with life, avoid becoming a ""zen master"" -- bad for the soul , and deeply damaging to any kind of authentic artistic experience."
5,The Zen of Creativity,"This book takes you on a gentle and insightful journey. Whether you're a practicing Zen Buddhist or not, John Daido Loori expands your mind and opens new ways of tapping into our creative spirit. The Zen of Creativity is the first of many books I've read that explains Buddhist concepts in everyday, American language and thought. It also provides a very clear explanation of how creativity and human nature mysteriously blend together to create our natural being."
4,ok introduction to stick and dagger,"this book is alright...besides the Old skool Flashdance bandanas and x-tra small t-shirts, black and white photos, it's okey doky. for the price and info I recommend it for those who wanna see the author's take on stick and dagger. I still personally like the Presas style or Rey Galang style or better yet Gaje style...but if you wanna ok primer this is it...just don't expect too much.The only real advantage I saw in this book is the author is really small and he always talks about size advantage and disadvantage...being of short height myself, I can see where these weapons are to my advantage and also he talks about strategy and encountering larger opponents.My Verdict: Great for beginners, ok for intermediate, and for the pros...good material to teach to students. Good for short people like me. heheIF you really wanna good book on ESPADA Y DAGA check out Rey Galang's Classic Arnis...I just got my copy and I'd have to say it's the best Arnis book in my possesion."
3,"A good work, sometimes a bit boring...","The sound is always a pleasure and Kenny G is always a masterpiece. Some songs are well done (""Careless wisper"" for example), but sometimes can appear a bit boring. I think that another Kenny's job (""Silhouette"") was better than this."
1,endless and meaningless,"I am a hardcore jazz fan and i heard a lot of friends of mine(non-musicians) saying they liked Kenny G, so i had to know what it was all about.I find that he plays very relaxing ""music"" with a pop sound(he sometimes sounds like the music of an x-rated movie), but he has no inspiration , no sense of intensity , no drive , a very poor rhythmic sense , and ridiculous harmonic choices .In fact he is just ""filling the blanks"" , and he is totally unable to interest anyone who has played music for more than a month.The challenge with smooth music is that even though you are smooth you need to communicate rather than to repeat endlessly those little cliches that Kenny like so much.If you like him i urge you to try to find a music that really ""says something"" , not necessairly jazz , because music is about communication , not background noise(and I really mean NOISE)."
2,Songs Are Not The Same,"I was very disappointed when I purchased my Kenny G ""At Last"" CD and found that the songs are all turned around and one in particular, ""Careless Whisper"" by Brian Mcknight is totally missing from the CD. Instead, there is a musical rendition of Norah Jones' ""I Don't Know Why""....what happened here??????"
4,"Not a big fan of Kenny G, but like guest musicians","""Pick up the Pieces"" with David Sanborn was the only reason I bought this album. Over all the album is well produced loaded with talent, but is just not my style of music."
3,A slide,"I've been following this mans music for quite a while. I have to honestly say, this last CD is not all its cracked up to be. He CD's always make you want to move in someway. With this I'm ready to go to sleep. Theres really nothing to it. Its just blah. Its kind've depressing is what it is. Still on the other had, the sound quality of the instrument makes up for the combo songs."
3,A little disappointing,"This is the first Kenny G album that I've regretted purchasing. It's adequate, but the pop remakes (e.g. Everything I Do, Careless Whisper, Baby Come to Me, Don't Know Why) don't do anything for me. This CD is just a little bit boring. Thank goodness for Picking Up the Pieces and The Way You Move, or I'd have to rate this one even lower.I have to say that I probably wouldn't buy this album if I had it to do over again."
1,"It is OK ! Next time,team up with Anita Baker and Regina Belle !","Most of the tracks lack emotion and inspiration.Try next time,with less hype and more substance."
1,Kenny G is a horrible saxophonist,"Please noone buy this cd. It is a waste of your time, and the fact that so many people buy this cd goes along with how humans are getting more idiotic as we destroy the planet and continue to rise conflicts in other countries that could amount to a bigger picture. Kenny G is a horrible saxophonist, and all he plays are simplistic lines that people can wrap their heads around easily. If you want to listen to a great saxophonist, listen to Kenny Garret. Or Cannonball Adderly, John Coltrane, Joshua Redman, Wayne Shorter. If you like smooth jazz, Gerald Albright is an excellent saxophonist to listen to."
4,Smooth !,"I've loved listennigng to Kenny G. for ages ... This CD is new to me, but it has the KG touch !"
4,Nice change,"You know it's sad when someone has to put down another person just to make them feel bigger. I found this album was a fresh change to doing cover songs - face it, everyone in the industry is doing covers, but I really liked the different feel to them. There are some not so great Duet albums out there, unfortunately I have even bought a few, but I feel this one is a good buy..."
3,Good quality. Overpriced,Works OK. Should not have had ugly slotted screws at this price. Required cutting the lugs off the company's EGT gage to get it to fit.
3,Good Diet Plan,"I found the diet plan very good. In the back of the book are l4 day calorie counted menu plans that work well if you cook a lot. The only down side is it is expensive to get started. You need a lot of spices, fish, and other lean meats. Lots of veges. and fruits. My first grocery bill to get started ran over 200.00. If you don't like fish, than I wouldn't recommend this book. The first l4 day plan has 9 menu's for fish. The recepies are good, though."
2,not for me,"Buy the book and make your own recipes, do not order the program. The customer service is rude and you're better off using the recipes in the book. You can add a little flavor and do much better by yourself."
3,Distracted by the humor,"If the idea of sacred sex is totally foreign to you, you need this book. I bought one based on the previous reviews (see below) and was looking to improve my overall relationship with my husband of 27 years for Christ's glory. I give my husband, a bible teacher, credit for teaching me on many levels how our marriage is a priceless picture of Jesus and His bride. Regarding this book, the humor was a distraction and undermined an otherwise holy message. Quoting W.C. Fields, Marilyn Monroe, Billy Crystal and the like seemed contrary to the reverence the title suggests. The author was *not* crude or vulgar. I just recommend you read the excerpts Amazon offers on this book before purchasing. If the humor you see there works for you, I came away appreciating: 1) Mrs. Gardner's brief contributions and 2) the author's comment of how desecrated sex has become. You might trySacred Marriage."
2,not that bad,this book can not satisfy you ..you must go to the text books to understand..but give you an idea about the topics neaded for DAT
3,Plant,I followed the planting and care instructions but my plant went to plant heaven. Bought seeds too and they will not germinate.
2,flowers,when i got the plants half the leaves were broken . i emailed the company and the returned my money even though they really didn't have to because the plants are still alive .there honest .
3,Himalayan blue poppy,2nd year now and still pampering. I am not confident it will come up again next spring. Keeping my fingers crossed. Of course it hasn't bloomed yet. If it doesn't bloom next spring I may stop pampering so much.
2,"Too small, too fake, too much shipping",I just wanted to get my boyfriend a decent anniversary gift. I was probably silly for expecting something to be a little more sturdy for only 20 dollars but the least they could of done is gave it an adjustable chain or something. I will admit though it shipped quickly but that's about it.
4,Perfect.,I loved this pendant. I wore it 24/7 for months and the chain broke. Kinda to be expected from so much wear and tear. Very nice for the money though.
5,Top Teen Pick in Youth Group,Finally a scientific look at God's awesome creations without putting down God's power and omnipotence! This book gives teens an inside look at an entire gamut of deep scientific wonders with their incredible patterns and systems. It is a treasure to me as a Christian who believes God is the pattern setter who began the evolutionary process and continues to be in charge of it today through millions of fascinating creations in space and on earth! A must read for young minds looking at accepting God's place in the evolution of this amazing universe!
5,Day four the sun and the moon.,It amazes me the amount of Christians that read Genesis and know the sun and moon came on the fourth day and the creation of the Earth before the sun. Big Bang clearly needs the sun to come before the Earth. Big Bang has no place in Genesis. It also amazes me how Christians miss the six days of creation and the resting on the seventh day as our daily pattern in life with our work week. How unique is this? This book is stunning and very accurate. Too many Christians believe in Jesus but not Genesis. After reading these two Absolutely Awesome books to my family I rest securely in my Christian faith and rejoice that the Bible is infallible from Genesis to Revelations. God's Creation is all around us and there are still so many that cannot see it. Absolutely Awesome devotions!!!!!!!!!
5,Simply Amazing,"I grew up in the Appalachians in the 60's and 70's going to a Bluegrass bar called The Northshore Boathouse on Swartzwood Lake, NJ. Lots of Flatt and Scruggs, Bill Monroe, and ""hippie bluegrass"".I also listened to the media from NYC - WNEW, WLIR and other great radio stations in the late 70's who were playing the likes of Television, Patti Smith, Sex Pistols, Iggy Pop, Devo, The Clash and Talking Heads.Blanche seems to take the raw power and sound of all of my favorite genres and combines these with great lyrics to create one of my favorite albums ever."
4,A nice shot of locally grown Americana creepiness,"I heard one of their tracks through my local univirsity radio stations (CJAM 91.5) and immediately fell in love with their sound. Old-timey rhythms mixed with acoustic and electric instruments, all uniting in a gothic country sound. Banjo's seem to be incredibly popular with the indie set these days, and being a sucker for a good roll I completely dug their work. The songs are mainly sung by the male lead, but a good portion of them are duets between him and the female lead, and works well. The songs are all good and unique (with an exception of the tried and trite 'Wayfaring Stranger') and are instantly hummable. A good band to give a chance for those Handsome Family fans."
5,Trust ME! The album is great.,"""If We Can't Trust the Doctors..."" is a heart-felt, geniusly-crafted journey into heartache, melancholy and hope. Expert songwriting and pedal steel work from this Detroit quintet. Fans of alt-country, bluegrass, indie, pop, and rock; join hands and unite! This is your gateway to cross-platform music genres. I recommend this whole-heartedly, with contempt or ill-intention, to ANYONE who enjoys great music."
2,"Best of times, worst of times","Like a Dickens novel, this album contains a couple of really great tunes, ala ""Who's to Say"" or ""Jack on Fire"". But there are some real stinkers as well, ""The Hopeless Waltz"" among them. At times, Blanche creates serenity out of chaos, but all too often their attempt at bridling disharmony results in a lot of white noise. If you're a fan of Blanche, then you might try this CD. If you haven't already acquired the ""taste"", spend your money more wisely elsewhere."
1,seller: Band Box 2,"purchased an item that was advertised. received different book, returned book with promise of the right book ordered,book was never shipped, refund to account, still advertising the book that is no longer in print will never by from bandbox 2 again!!!!Suzuki Piano School, Vol. 3Took almost 30 day to find out not in print after I was told they have it."
4,Pretty Useful,"Overall, a good purchase. The assembly instructions were easy to follow. The hex key and nut wrench provided were usable. All of the parts were present. The tire-holding frames are not ""D"" shaped. They resemble a ""B"" with the long, flat side down. Despite the fact that this product doesn't match the illustration provided at Amazon, this stand supports 26"" mountain bike tires well. I recommend this inexpensive stand for mountain bike use."
3,"OK, but easy to tip over","This rack is ok, but you have to be careful not to tip your bike over. I like that you can move it around easily, but it gets tipped over whenever the bike gets bumped (kids)."
5,"nice stand, works great","I bought this to help hold up my heavy beach cruiser with a large basket. This stand works great for my purpose and keeps my bike with a large basket from falling when used on the front wheel with the kick stand down in back. I only wish the wheels were rubber instead of hard plastic as they can scratch my wood floors if I'm not careful, not a problem in the garage."
1,Ruins bicycle wheel,My sister got this for her bike and the weight of the bike leaning on it caused the rear wheel to touch the brake pad. The wheel's truing is off.
1,Don't trust it. Don't like it,"It was the only bike stand I initially found at REI, San Francisco. There weren't any set up in the store which made me a bit suspicious but I bought it anyway.Why the hell is it on wheels? It slides all over the place and falls over! It's like put putting wheels on an extension ladder, or giving a fish a bike!When used ""correctly"", it holds my full size men's hybrid bike by wedging between the tire and the middle of the spokes. I'm sure if I had continued to to use it, it would put my wheel out of true! I don't like it and I don't trust it.The plastic parts have that noxious cheap Chinese plastic smell.I returned it immediately."
1,Not for a large mountain bike.,This is a light weight stand.I put in togther easily but it wouldn't hold up my bike. Front wheel would twist with the wheeled stand then tip. Back tire would tip over with stand. Couldn't get fat tires out of stand easily.Sent it back.
3,solid build... but rollers?,"I was surprised how well it was built. The rollers will be problematic for using it for repairs but if you take them off bolts will dig into the ground. I don't think very wide tires will fit in this. The space only measured about 2.125"". It would have been nice if this space could be adjusted from road to mountain bike more quickly as it is fastened with bolts. For the price though it should do the job."
4,Baracuda,"I purchased this stand even after reading some negative reviews. It is well built, fit and finish very good. It did however tip over, so common sense will prevent this. I like this stand very much and the price was right"
2,Won't Hold a Mountain Bike,"Bought this to store my chrome mountain bike. It tips over on a perfectly flat surface. I'm sure it works for a light bike, but don't even think of buying it if you have a heavy bike. Assembly was easy."
4,Works fine but a fastener was missing,"The Delta Rothko bike stand is easy to assemble and move around, lightweight, and holds the bicycle well as long as the surface is level. The only complaint I have is that the parts package was missing a nut. Emailing the company only garnered a automated reply to visit their parts store on the web."
1,Terrible design!,"Whoever thought of putting wheels on this thing should be fired. When I put my mountain bike into it, it just slides around on any flat surface... you know, like a garage or hardwood floor? Where people store bicycles. Maybe I should keep it in my carpeted living room!So, I thought, maybe I should take the wheels off? Then it just tips right over.Oh, and when it does manage to stay up (2 minutes, max)... the stand puts pressure on the spokes of the wheel. This is a terribly bad design. Don't waste your money. Look elsewhere..."
5,Follow your intuition and obtain this cd,"An easy five stars for the singers beautiful voice and very beautiful, heavenly, and uplifting music. I only wished that I had purchased the cd sooner but needless to say was ecstatic when I did. Every track on this cd is strong, upbeat, and fun to where you can honestly play this whole cd through and through. The duo have good musical chemistry together on this cd. I honestly listen to this cd the whole way through when I play it but some of the songs that I really like are ""I see right through to you"", ""Intuition"", ""Walking in the Sky"", and ""High on Life"". This is another classic eurodance album that will definitely be remembered as one of the tops. All in all a very joyful and fun album that I would recommend easily."
5,ALL HITS FROM BEGINNING TO END!!,"Super CD in every way. Unique interesting songs, beautiful singing. Good trance takes good song selection, good playing, good vocals and inovative mixing and THIS IS GOOD TRANCE--FIVE STARS!!"
5,"Cool,Dazzly, and Fun","This album is Cool. The music puts trance and pop the lyrics are also great. I can groove to this album all night long. If you like trance, rave, jungle, or dance. This is a got to get cd. The hot tracks that i really like are High On Life and I See Right Through You..Thank you for reading"
1,"I give this 0 stars, You can't call this a dance album","This is so a waste of money, It's a chick singing love songs to a bunch of repetitive trance songs. The only reason I bought this CD was for the song "" I See Right Through to You"" Which is probably the only good song on here, which is completly played out. To much fluff, not enough dance."
5,"WHOA, the last time I heard a voice this beautiful was......","This is DEFINITELY AND I MEAN IT, DEFINITELY THE BEST CD I'VE BOUGHT SINCE ACE OF BASE'S ""FLOWERS"" which I called my favourite CD since 1998, the last time I heard a voice anywhere near as beautiful as Engelina's was either Ace of Base's Linn Berggren, or Celine Dion, but Engelina has by far passed both of them up. Just when I didn't think it was possible, she did it. Her voice is like an angel, its beautiful, but somehow so indescribable. Engelina has definitely been blessed with a special talent and hopefully we'll hear more from her in the years to come. The best song on the cd is for sure track 7 ""You've got a way"", its beautiful, I just can't say anything else about it, it takes my breath away, you need to experience this, its like nothing I ever could imagine. Heres to hoping DJ Encore and Engelina's MAJOR TALENT is one day heard cause it deserves it."
5,Great!!,"Awesome CD. I love it. Shipping was fast, It came sooner than i was expecting. I would buy from you guys again."
