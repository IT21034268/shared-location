4,Great Cd,This is a CD that has been out since 2003 and I just found out about it 8/22/09. This wonderful man of God who God is doing great things in his life and you can tell by this CD press my way. This is an awesome cd that really make you realize that you are blessed and a wonderful praise cd also. I would recommend this Cd to all that like press my way and like to get there praise on for God.
4,GREAT HOLSTER,"I finally broke down and bought an ankle holster. I almost didn't buy one because I've heard so many horror stories about guns falling out or the whole rig falling off.But if you need an ankle holster, you can't beat this Bianchi Triad holster. It's comfortable, it doesn't wiggle around and it holds the weapon securely."
4,disparate tidbits,"The book gathers together a disparate and funky collection of programming tidbits and trivia. Only some of these are actually coding problems. For example, in one section it asks if you recognise certain trademarks or marketing diagrams that were used in the recent past.The reverse engineering chapter might be an eye opener of what can be deduced from an executable, by using a good tool like SoftIce.For many programmers, there should be something new in this book."
2,Not what I expected,"This probably should be called Puzzles for Crackers, not hackers.Many if not most of the puzzles deal with insecure code and uncovering weak encryption. Several of the puzzles deal with assembly language or modifying raw binaries.That's fine if you want that. But, I was looking more for higher level programming tips, challenges, and puzzles, more like what is in the book Programming Pearls."
3,Just O.K.,The ingredients are very hard to find. The author is from Europe. The food is just O.K. I have made 5 dishes from it and my husband has not liked a single one. I probably won't use it anymore.
5,Excellent book!,"I bought this book after I saw the author on The View. I have two small children at home and I wanted easy meals to make that they would eat, along with my husband and me. i found these recipes to be easy to make and delicious! I am not a cook but this book has helped me feel less intimidated by the kitchen and actually made me feel proud that I can cook meals that the whole family eats and likes. great book!"
2,nothing new,"This is not worth wasting your money on unless you have no idea how to make a meal appealing to a child. I was looking for recipes that would be different than your normal kid fare, meals sophisticated in taste and ingredients yet still appealing to a child. Unfortunately you won't get that in this cookbook - you'll get your standard kid's meals. Don't waste your money."
3,cookbook,Some meals look alittle too time consuming. My son is not really into any of the recipes yet so I haven't tried too many of them
3,Disappointed,I ordered this book after seeing the author on TV. I was so taken by the 'images' that I bought the book. I opened the book excited to find the recipes I saw on TV but I was really disappointed when I found the recipes and I found NO pictures!In my opinion all recipes should have pictures especially hers because she is creating them so children will be excited enough by the images to eat the food. I also thought that her recipes could be used at any dinner party that you wanted to have a whimiscal looking dish!But if you can't see how she made them then there is no way to reconstruct the recipe as it does not tell you what you saw on TV.
1,2 have failed after 2 years,We have had 2 of these units fail in the last 2 years. One of them did not have any load connected to it at all.
2,The candle didn't keep the mosquitos away.,"You get a tiny booklet with a tiny bit of information. The candle, to be used after dark, didn't keep the mosquitos away. The other thing you get - a ""solar-powered guard"" to wear around your neck, ""generates a barely-audible buzz that replicated the wing-beat freequency of the mosquito's natural predator, the dragonfly."" We aren't bothered by mosquitos in the daytime, so I haven't tried that. The candle didn't help stop the mosquitos, so I'd have to say I wasn't impressed."
2,Major Diappointment,"I don't know what MTV thinks ""uncensored"" means, but it sure isn't what my dictionary says! There are some funny and interesting behind the scenes spots, but the annoying BLEEPS over any nasty words and the mosaic over any nudity far outweighs anything positive about this tape. If anything, the footage teases with new footage but never comes through. I wasn't expecting any porn shots, but figured I'd see or hear something ""uncensored"". STAY AWAY!"
1,Do not buy this video!,"This is a very misleading video package. You will expect nudity and adult material, but it's just a collection of stuff you could have easily seen on MTV. From now on I will consult Amazon reviews before wasting $19 on a piece of garbage like this. If anyone knows how I can get my money back from Sony, let me know!"
1,Avoid this video! DON'T BUY!,"I concur with my fellow reviewers. This cover leads you on and lets you believe you'll be seeing uncensored picture of some of the Real World stars. Not so! All of the ""erogenous zones"" are blurred out and all the swearing is censored as well. So much for ""Totally Uncensored""!"
1,(1-1/2 stars) What can I say that hasn't already been said?,"There are two things that will really say what's wrong with this video. One is that it advertises that there is 100% never-before-seen footage, but EVERYTHING on the video was shown in the episodes they aired on TV (except maybe some of the confessionals and the outtakes). And the other thing is...well, I guess MTV has a different definition for ""uncensored"" than everyone else has, because everything is censored, even profanity in the dialogue. This video is false advertising. Don't buy it."
1,totally stupid!,"I went into this movie thinking that it would be unsensored and show new and improved pieces, but that was just a crock!"
1,Pointless in every way,"Uncensored and Uncut? Maybe MTV has a different definition of ""Uncensored"" than the rest of the world. I offer up a new title, ""Sad and Pathetic.""Boring and near unwatchable. I, too, wish I could receive some kind of refund after purchasing this tape. Completely misrepresented, and not entertaining please heed my warning and don't reward them for slapping together such a pointless and mislabelled compilation."
1,This video is not worth you money!,"This video is not even worth watching. Them bastards fuzzed out ruthie`s boobies. If you wanted to see their naked body parts, then you`ll be dissapointed. We the people, have been mislead by the advertising for this video. I say, go rent a porno instead."
3,Real Is Trick,Real World is Awesome. You get up close and personal with these seven strangers. I can't wait till next season to see what MTV and Real World have in store for us viewers. Keep up the great work MTV.....
1,PURE GARBAGE,I CANT BELEIVE ALL THE GARBAGE ON THI PROGRAM AND THE BS GET RIDOF IT PLEASE FOR GODS SAKE WHO GOES TO LIVE WITH PEOPLE THEY DONT KNOW ONLY LOW LIFES BUMS AND DRUG ADDICTS PLEASE GET RID OF THE GARBAGE LETS START THINKING OF MORE POSITIVE THINGS TO PUT ON TV AND BY THE WAY MORE REALISTIC
1,Hmmm...,"What do you do when you're tired of your own life? Why, you watch other people live their lives! And not very well! Whiny, irritating people live out their ""real"" lives just for you. A must have!"
1,A Real Waste,"This is nothing but stuff that fell on the cutting room floor that didn't make the MTV edit. It's a waste of time and money. If you want to get close to the cast members, move to Hollywood. They're all over this place. And they think they're real actors. Ha!"
4,Pretty Good...But what were you expecting?,"I liked this video. However, if ones intentions for buying it were to see/hear uncensored aspects of show (nudity/swearing)- you will be really disappointed. It is very censored. But if you are interested in seeing some hysterically amusing previously unseen on tv parts of the show (What was it really like? What did they think of this? What was really going on with those two? etc) - I think the video will be worth the price. Basically, after watching the tape, I felt like I understood more about what was going on and I was rolling on the floor laughing at the same time."
2,"Fan of the show this year, not the video","Light entertainment, like the show. A little more in depth, but not what expected having seen the Boston/Seattle video which was much more comprehensive of behind the scenes fun. Not much of that in this Hawaii video. You get some hosting, but mostly just a few extra scenes that would have made MTV anyway except that they ran out of episodes."
3,Uncensored... I think not! Still has the fuzzy bars... :(,"Ok it did get into a little more detail, but the commercial says its not censored, it still is you dont see anything more than what you've already seen on tv... dissapointing."
2,Not the best behind-the-scenes video.,"I was very excited to see the new edition to MTV's behind the scenes videos, but was grossly disappointed when I finally did. While it did show some fun scenes, it still blurs out the nudity (hey, what happened to the ""real"" part?) and spends a good chunk of time of Tek and Colin's passing gas. Overall, I'm glad I saw it, but it's not worth owning it. Rent it if you can."
4,Pretty Good View of the 'Real' Real World,"This video has some pretty good stuff on it, like the unveiling of the cast's car, that you didn't see! By the way, what happened when Amaya went to a grocery store in Hawaii? All this and more!"
2,big lie,"The box says 100%uncovered, what a big lie! I thought it would be uncensored. It's the same stuff that you would see on regular TV. Don't waste your money on this."
1,"Don't be misled by ""100% Uncovered""","This video is not worth buying. MTV misled me and many other buyers by advertising ""100% uncovered, unedited, etc."" That advertising is what got me to buy the video in the first place, but basically it is a bad version of the show, edited speech and blurred nudity. If you are looking to see something you didn't see on the TV show, this isn't the video you want. In my opinion, don't buy this video."
2,Why would you waste your money,"Please people, get a life already.....what you have hear are a bunch of spoiled brats who have no morals and they are being heralded as ""role models"".This is not the real world people..Most kids don't have a house in Hawaii handed to them...Don't waste your time or money"
3,"OK, but not great","I LOVE horror. I am addicted to it. I had such high hopes for Joe Hill, but thought that I would try a book of short stories first to get a feel for his style. I tried very hard to not compare him to his father. I was beyond disappointed. The stories are mostly boring, with the exception of only a few. There were about 3 stories in the book that I actually enjoyed. The rest were boring. I would read the whole story thinking, there is going to be some twist, there has to be! Nope. I might read Heart Shaped Box because again, I hear great things. I am desperately hoping that he is better at spinning a novel length tale than the he was with the short story."
2,Not his best work,"Since I enjoyed Heart Shaped box, I thought for sure I would enjoy 20th Century Ghosts as well. I gave it 100 pages or so, but couldn't take anymore. Yes, some of the topics are very different/bizzare, however they drag along too much and the endings were a bit of a let down. There is so much build up, but very little result. Overall, I was very dissappointed."
3,Very well written... very strange,"This is a very well written book, but it was a little bit too bizarre for me."
5,New King of short fiction?,"This guy is way better than his father has been lately. This book shows he knows his way around a short story better than King did in ""Everything's Eventual"" (a book I thought was more than decent). What I find really surprising is Hill's insight into the mind and motivations of the common man, considering he must have grown up never knowing need or deprivation. This type of down-to-earth, prosaic realism has been King's forte for decades and I daresay Hill gives him a run for his money. For fiction, especially genre fiction, enjoyment is inevitably proportionate to the measure that one can suspend disbelief. While Joe Hill's stories often veer toward the exceedingly fantastic, they are carefully constructed to be literary Golden Gate Bridges, the other side of which you always want to behold."
3,"Some good stories here, but nothing great","This book of short stories is an impressive debut from the son of the horror legend, Stephen King. Like his father's early work, Hill manages to scare people using the ordinary aspects of life and turn it around to make it something no one is familiar with.However, there are many stories that are not hair-raising or scary. Better Than Home is one of these stories. It is not scary. It is about a boy who drools when he gets nervous. I have no idea why this story is in a book called 20th Century Ghosts. There is no ghost. There is no horror. It is out of place and therefore takes away from the book as a whole. The other story that has no place is called ""Bobby Conroy Comes Back From the Dead."" It is about a man and woman who reconnect with each other while filming ""Dawn of the Dead"" with George Romero. Again, this is NOT HORROR. I blame the publisher for including these works in something called 20th Century Ghosts."
3,So-so,"Can't say that I enjoyed this one. I abandoned it at about 75%. The author's writing skills are great, but his stories leave a lot to be desired. When POP ART is my favorite of this collection, the rest hasto be pretty forgettable. I'll have to get HEART SHAPED BOX and try that."
4,Very good read,"This was my first time reading Joe Hill and I find him very engaging, I was drawn into his characters and found them to be what I would expect from a scary story. I cannot review all the stories for that would not be fair to you and the opinion you will draw for yourself, I will say however that several of the stories left me wanting more.Enjoy the book for that is what he intended. :)"
3,20th Centry Ghosts,"If you are expecting a collection of ghost stories, please reset your expectations, or you will be disappointed. There are a couple of ghost stories, some 1950's style horror stories, some modern horror, some supernatural and some straight fiction. I picked this book up after reading Joe Hill's ""Heart Shaped Coffin"". I was impressed with the straight-forward writing style used in that book, and I wanted to see some of his earlier work. I wasn't disappointed.The short story titled ""20th Century Ghost"" is a very good ghost story whereas ""Best New Horror"" was a very good modern horror story. These two stories were my favorites with ""Voluntary Commitment"", ""Bobby Conroy Comes Back from the Dead"", ""The Black Phone"", and ""The Widow's Breakfast"" not far behind. If you are looking for an enjoyable collection of short stories with a mix of topics, try this book."
5,Most imaginative stories,"I did not think I would love ""20th Century Ghosts"" as much as I did ""Heart Shaped Box,"" both by Joe Hill. I do! Joe Hill's imagination is beautiful and horrific. His stories are dark, clever, and at times humorous. But, Hill's stories also have a tenderness I've never seen in other stories of this genre. I've never read anything like them. Wow!"
4,You've never read horror like this before.,"Fifteen of the best short stories I've read in a very long time. Some are skin crawling horrid, some are touchingly human, but all are gripping and thought provoking.Giant bugs, blow-up friends, vampires in training, flying blanket capes, a very strange museum of death; each story is a world of its own, all are the world of Joe Hill.I can promise that I'll be looking for more from Joe Hill.Review by Wanda C. Keesey (author Lost In The Mist release May 2008)"
3,"Extremely Well Written, Not Very Scary","The technical writing here by Joe Hill is exemplary, but I didn't find it very scary. He has some beautiful stories, thick with atmosphere and emotion, but I don't think it should have be included or labeled in a horror short story collection. While the stories are quite different from each other, none of them really grab you by the throat the way great horror can do. I'm curious to see what he does in the future using a longer format such as his debut novel Heart Shaped Box. Regardless, Joe Hill is certainly someone to keep your eye on."
3,Oddly Absurd and Twisted,"The title of this book is a bit misleading. Rather than ghost-stories, this is a collection of science fiction and mild horror shorts. Most of the stores weren't even really scary.There is a variety of oddities here, ranging from the absurdity of a plastic-inflatable kid to a ghost phone that rings without being hooked up. There are also disturbing and twisted stories such as a child's blanket-turned cape that allows it's wearer to become a super villain or a trip to the family's lake cabin that becomes a Wonderland-esque adventure within the mind.I can't say I disliked the book, but I wasn't quite thrilled with it either. There were good stories, bad stories, and fair stories. Not the best thing I've read recently, but certainly not the worst either."
2,Not good,"I love Horror but was disappointed in this effort. There was not a single story in this collection that I thought was scary or dark. I was expecting something similar to the Heart Shaped Box, which I enjoyed very much."
3,no ghosts,"I absolutely loved Joe Hills first book, the Heart shaped box. I expected this to live up to that sitting around the campfire way of story telling. Afraid not, these are ramblings, incomplete thoughts and no fright at all. If you just like to hear someone else talk, by all means this is your book. Definitely don't expect ghosts and what those words conjure up."
4,The problem with short stories...,"... is that they're so short! All of these worked well, it's not that they weren't developed or lacked anything. They fit the short story format perfectly, but almost all of them left me thinking, ""This would be excellent in novel form."" All of them were perfectly self-sufficient as short stories, and still retained the depth and complexity that they could have been expanded and fleshed out into full books.I thoroughly enjoyed reading the e-book. This is the first writing by Joe Hill I've read (I have the collab. between him and Stephen King waiting in my Kindle) and am very impressed. The stories stuck with me (for good or ill) after I read them and it was nearly impossible to put the Kindle down in the middle of a story. This runs the gamut of truly scary ghost stories to the wistful, slightly sad ghosts.I recommend this and look forward to more from the author."
4,enjoyed 80% of this book,Im giving this book 4 stars instead of five because although i loved the stories inside i was a little confused by a few of them. The endings where abrupt and while i can embrace this most of the time(if the story merits it) I felt myself scratching my head and re reading a couple of pages thinking i had missed something. The story Pop Art was amazing and im defo going to buy another one of his books. Oh and for those only buying because they think they are reading King then guess again. Hill has his own style of writing and although its easy to read like King his ideas and style are defo his own. Im certainly a new fan for life.
3,entertaining,"Fun to read. This is the first Joe Hill book I've had the pleasure of reading I felt some of the stories exceptional, others a little too over the top for me. I'm a huge fan already and can not wait to read more of Joe Hill's works."
2,A little disappointed,"I am disappointed in these stories. The voice lacks enthusiasm and is on the dull side. These stories are far from exciting and lack a solid plot, there are not the least bit scary and I found them to be quite boring."
2,Not as good as Heart-Shaped Box,"When I read Heart-Shaped Box, I thought that this book of short stories had potential to be very scary. I was very disapointed to find out that not only were none of these stories scary in the least, they had no ending, which left you hanging. Some of the stories, such as ""Better than Home"" in NO WAY constituted a ghost story, or was frightening in any way, shape, or form. As another reviewer mentioned, my favorite part of the book was a story that was told within one of the srories... I would not reccomend this book overall."
2,Poor Title For This Book,"I was really looking forward to this book after reading Heart Shaped Box, but I have to admit I was disappointed. I think the title was misleading and a few of the stories left me hanging. I think Joe Hill has the ability to write better material than 20th Century Ghosts. I don't think that I will be recommending this book to anyone."
3,20th Century Ghosts,When I received the book it has had water damage and has a mildew smell to it. The pages are not stuck together but you can tell it was damaged sometime. When I opened the package you could smell the mildew odor strongly. I will not be ordering from this company again.
1,Strange,"I found this book to have little to do with ghosts and more about weird tales. This type of book might be fine for some, but as a person whose interest is more along the lines of ghost tales, this didn't do it for me.Some might find this interesting, I didn't."
2,20th Century Ghosts,I was a little disappointed with this book. The stories are not really about ghosts. They are just fantasy stories that a young child would make up.
1,Horrible book,"I have to say this is the worst set of ""ghost"" stories I have ever read. Some are nothing more than poorly written, cheap Sci-Fi stories and have nothing to do with ghosts. I am extremely disappointed and dissatisfied and will never purchase anything else written by this author. He may be Steven Kings son but he has no talent for writing."
3,Promising collection of tales,"There were a couple of stories in this collection that I thought were outstanding--""Pop Art"" and ""Voluntary Committal"". I also liked ""My Father's Mask"" (which may be appropos of the mask that Mr. Hill wears when he writes under Joe Hill and doesn't capatilize on his father's more famous name). In any case, I found this collection of stories to show great promise. I think we will all be waiting for Mr. Hill's next release."
5,unenxpected and wonderful,"Reading this book of short stories was like opening the freezer on a hot summer day and finding an ice cream sandwich you forgot you put there: unexpected and WONDERFUL. If you haven't heard the name Joe Hill yet, I predict that you will, and very soon. The next published book, due out in a couple of weeks, is going to break him BIGTIME. This week I started reading 20th Century Ghosts, a book of short stories published in late 2007, and before I was even halfway through it I was in my car headed to the library to grab Heart-Shaped Box, which was his first novel. Unbelievably well-written, engaging stories, that will draw you in with a slight deja-vu, aslightly familiar feel, but a touch all his own. Joe Hill comes from writing royalty, but he has asked - and well deserves - to be measured on his own merit. He's damn good."
2,Nepotism?,"The lead story (Best New Horror) was solid, but after that, yawners, making one wonder how they got by the junior editors except with Daddy's help."
1,Throwaway,This book is the first book that I have ever considered throwing away. I read the short stories until I was scared to read the next one. I like ghost stories but for the two-thirds of the book that I read there was only one real ghost story (it was delightful); the rest were gruesome beyond belief. A friend took it off my hands so I did not have to pitch it after all.
4,A really good collection of short stories.,"Let me start off by saying Joe Hill would have made one hell of a writer for the original Twilight Zone. There are quite a few stories in here that just reminded me of that show. Others had a nostalgic feel referring to old disney movies, peter pan and things you could tell that Hill pulled from his child hood. I enjoyed every single story in this book. They're all a great mix of horror, drama and action.If you enjoyed 20th Century Ghosts you should definitely check out Hill's comic series Locke & Key."
4,20th Century Ghosts,"After reading Heart Shaped Box, I really wanted to pick this book up as well.The short stories included are:Best New Horror, 20th Century Ghost, Pop Art, You Will Hear The Locust Sing, Abraham's Boys, Better Than Home, The Black Phone, In The Rundown, The Cape, Last Breath, Dead-Wood, The Widow's Breakfast, Bobby Conroy Comes Back from the Dead, My Father's Mask and Voluntary Committal.I enjoyed reading 20th Century Ghosts. Not all the stories were scary, some were just strange...kind of like something you might see on the The Twilight Zone."
4,This book is a good choice for HTML newbies.,"While ""101"" books do not pretend to cover every facet of a topic (and this one doesn't) is covers enough for you to create a very nice web page from scratch, with no prior experience. It has a clear writing style, and is not intimidating. An excellent choice for an HTML newcomer. Also, some good software is on the CD ROM that comes packaged with the book."
5,The Landscape of North Florida Jumps Off the Page,"The pristine north Florida landscape jumps off the page at you, as do the characters in this awesome book by Betsy James. The stories are tinged with humor and melancholy, also You'll read about the ghosts of the Drew Mansion and moonshiner Louis Hill, a true-to-life Madison County, Florida legend.Thank you, Betsy James, for introducing the world to north Florida and all our interesting people"
2,PlugOff - Why Bother,A complete waste of time. Out of date coverage that tells you nothing. Spend the money on a can of lager and stay in playing with all the shareware plug-ins available on the net. You'll learn far more! Sorry.
5,Trememdous book by a tremendous photographer,In my opinion this coffee table book is the one by which all others should be judged. Gleason is one fine professional photographer who needs to expand into yet more regions on this same subject of old plantation homes
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I like the book, but I am glad that I bought a used copy (cheaper) through the Amazon listed sellers. I thought that some of the photos should have been taken from a different view to get the best photo. Also, some of the photos have no comments about them, and for a couple I was not sure to which house they applied, or what room, or house location. My book did not come with a dust cover in case the info was there, but it would have been nice to know in the first pages the name of the house on the cover, without having to wait to find it.To some it up, nice book, but but a good used version."
5,Great Take On The Gospel Story,"I recently received my copy of ""The Cotton Patch Gospel"" and I must say that I am thrilled. I have never written a reveiw for anything before, but I believe that this video warrants my time and attention.This is the Gospel story of Jesus Christ as told through the lens of the South. This one-man (for the most part) performance offers the Gospel story in a new and interesting fashion. The town names are familiar. The dialect is familiar. The music, well it's not familiar, but it sure is a true Southern comfort.I would recomend this video for ages ranging from youth to adult and this would be a great launching pad from which to begin discussions on the Gospel story. Also, I believe that this may be a valuable resource for helping Christians develop their own way to 'tell' the Gospel Story.God Bless"
5,Mind over Matter is good brain stuff!,"This fast paced book, set in the near future, revolves around 2 men. Walter Danan has discovered new astounding powers of mind that he claims anyone can have. But he comes to be feared and hated by his boyhood rival, Silas Lindquist, who is now one of the most powerful rulers of the solar system.Filled with technical marvels of the future (some of which I would like to see, and some of which are a nightmare!) and intelligent and humorous writing, Zimmermann weaves an intriguing story, on one side filled with ambition, lust, pride, and greed, and on the other side virtue, caring, and a determination to free people from the tyranny of the mind that the Monitors exercise over most of the population."
4,"Amazing writing, like poetry&#65533;.","While it does indeed share some of the same themes of The Scarlet Letter, I think this novel is incredible in it own right. Wonderfully detailed, with lots of back-story included, helped me really get a good sense of place and the characters. The plot itself focuses on elite families in New York during the 1950s and the extremely successful law firm they run. The scandal at the very beginning (one of the powerful lawyer's son in laws has committed adultery) is only the very beginning. The writer explores the web of relationships between the families and all the secrets and lies their lives are built on. While some people complain that the author's writing is a bit old-fashioned, I personally think it added to the story, but I admit, I did have to look up a few words! Overall, quite an enjoyable read, and I will be checking out more of the author's work."
1,"when did you last say ""plethora""?","Auchincloss has a tin ear: people don't use words like ""plethora"" in everyday conversation. Not only is his style wooden, he hasn't progressed an inch in his story-telling beyond ""The Great World and Timothy Colt,"" which I read 50 years ago. In fact, ""Timothy Colt"" was better!"
2,OS 9 ONLY,"DANGER. This software says it will work with Mac, but will require you to do so in classic mode. That means my fourth grader will need my help to get her there every time she uses the program. Not worth it."
1,cd won't work,Having problems getting the cd to install and their customer service is not helpful. My computer does meet the system requirements they outlined.
2,"One-and-three-quarter stars for Cheap Trick alone, but the last reviewer is correct! No UNinterrupted tines, reviews, videos.","Cheap Trick here is fine enough, if youcan stand TP (see the barely above average'From Tokyo to You' if want the 'Worst ofTP'!)...Average it ain't, but for CT fansit'll have to do. The rest of the bandshere are pretty awful!"
5,A wonderfully compassionate Author and Compelling stories,"When my sister lost her beloved Great Dane, I mourned for her too. I'm a cat person, and this big black incredibly sweet baby was the first dog I ever loved. When I visited my sister last year and she showed me this book, explaining that the author had been there in the Tufts Vet ER with her when Azaria was brought in, I was amazed. I continued to be amazed as I saw my sister's very special love for my doggy-niece through the eyes of a total stranger. It would have been very easy to dismiss how painful losing a pet can be, very easy to miss the ties of love between a pet and her owner. My sister loved her dog, quirks and fears and vet bills and all. I loved her too. Thanks, Vicki. Your gentle presentation of their story is the finest tribute Zari could have had."
5,Could not put it down,"The author is my Spanish teacher and friend and I was not sure what to expect when I sat down to read her book. I thought and hoped it would be good. I intended to read a chapter or two and then prepare for bed. Instead I stayed up until I read it all, even delaying bathroom breaks until the last moment. I'm no critic and I'm prejudiced, of course, but I do know I love a book that compels me to keep reading and this one did that."
5,Great watch,"I love this watch. I like the way it feels, I like the way it looks and the price was great. I would definitely recommend it."
1,When Stupid people do stupid things,"This book is for people who think that the articles in People Magazine are too technical and in depth. If you read a lot of magazines for slow preteen girls you might enjoy this rather weak story, I don't know how this one ever got published. The ending is in no way worth the long and boring trip it takes to get there"
4,Pay attention to which edition!,"The book and service are just fine, arrived quickly. The only think was I meant to buy the second edition! ah well...it's still a good book with so much information about this ancient art that it will take years of study and practice to really absorb!"
3,Good for younger fans,The Nancy Drew Notebook series is great for younger Nancy Drew fans. Kids can try to solve the mystery along with Nancy!
5,F/i - 'A Question For The Somnambulist' (Strange Attractions),"I've wanted to get my hands on a copy of this particular F/i disc for ages now. Well worth the wait. Over-the-top space rock from this Wisconsin collective. Tracks that are guaranteed to pull your senses fully 'in' are the atmospheric fourteen-minute brain-sizzling opener ""Uber-Wizards Of The 88th Meridian"", the industial-like space rocker ""Using Enemy Weapons"", the wonderfully cosmic ""No Pepsi In Kabul"" and the fifteen-minute title cut ""A Question For The Somnambulist"". Plus, this edition has one added bonus song - ""The Hot Shop"". Only question I have now - is what (in tarnations) is a somnambulist? According to my sources - it's apparently a sleepwalker. Recommended listening."
5,A worthwhile and tantalizing novel!,"What an exciting story! I thoroughly enjoyed all the many facets of POTOMAC CAPTIVE. The tale itself is riveting, the glimpses of life in America in the 17th century are tantalizing, and I was fascinated by the introduction to the Algonquin language. I hope the book finds the full readership it deserves. Teachers will find it perfect collateral reading for early American history studies. The extensive chapter notes could show the use of primary sources. I can even see some students making an Algonquin dictionary. This is a worthwhile and interesting historical novel."
5,WOW!,"This truly is a great story....Shows just how deeply man(or woman in this case) and mustangs can and do bond...As a owner of many breeds of horses, including 4 Mustangs, I appreciate her dispelling the myth that Mustangs are not trainable or of any value! And a big high five for her enthusiasm...I for one appreciate the way it reads (the few grammatical mistakes and typos)....It makes the journaling even more realistic! I truly believe if more people interested in owning horses read this, all of them would adopt mustangs and experience the magic bonds that happen with only mustangs."
4,"Classic, practical, valuable","This useful book may appear out of date but it's packed with information useful to any painter or photographer. For example, a head shot is compared in different lighting. An identical pose is framed and placed differently. The author even provides forms and professional practice advice that would be helpful to any new practitioner. The styles and dress of the pictures are dated, but the content never goes out of date."
2,His second book is much better,"I really don't understand how you can publish an art book in black and white since art/painting is all about color. Many of the topics and examples are exactly the same as images included in subsequent books -- but, they are in color. The book was purchased as used. It would be very helpful if the sellers would specify that the book was previously owned by a smoker. As I attempted to read through the book i had a major allergy attack. I've been airing it out ever since in the hope that the odor will dissipate at some point. Don't recommend it."
4,picture adventure,Seymour is a little wooden doll who makes him self a boat from a juice box and sails away in the sea. Follow him on his adventure and see if you and your child can find all the items he is looking for.The photos are very clear and in full color. The book includes a guide in back for more learning fun to talk about with your child.I would recommend this book to kids ages 2-4. They will enjoy looking for all the items Seymor needs to build his boat!
3,not that good for a beginner,The ads for this book said the strumming pattern was included. IT IS NOT. I hope one day I will get good enough that the book might become useful to me. What good is the chord with no idea what the rhythm is?
1,Not a good buy!,"I bought this book before I learned to play guitar and I regret spending my money on this. If you are a piano player then buy this book but, if you are a guitarist then DON'T! I don't know what book the first reviewer was looking at but this book DOES NOT have original tunings. All it tells you is the original key the songs were played in. The GOO GOO DOLLS are the best band in the world and if you want to play their stuff note for note rather save your money and look for a 5 star tab on mxtabs.net. Im scared to buy another music book in case its like this one!"
1,"If you want to have fun, go buy this one.","OK, let's be fair - the first tape is pretty decent except for the guy who says 'Now I am here', but if you want to learn the history of swing go buy 'Swing - a new retrospective' book. The second tpe is good for teaching the basics, but go and find a live instructor.In the second tape, we had to rewind couple of times in the swing jams because it was really funny - no offense, but if you are doing a tape to sell, I think you need better dancers than this. It was hillarious - didn't they do any editing at all??? Pablo is really funny, especially when he gets tired at the end of second swing jam."
2,Not the best representation of current swing scenes,"Mostly taking part in Minnesota, it didn't seem to portray the high caliber of dancing that is out there. The vintage scenes from 30's were the best part of the tape. The caliber of dancing by the locals, while competent, is easily surpassed in other swing communities that could provide a better setting for a video like this. Would be better showing dance scenes from more cities around the country. Has an amusing quality to it that makes it a fun watch, kind of like watching a good'ol kitschy B-Movie."
3,Pablo works it,"This is a good video for beginners. It taught me all the East Coast basics, and I feel pretty confident with my East Coast now. The quality is pretty low budget, but it's a dance instructional video, not a feature film. Anyhow, they play a great song at the start of the swing jam, but they fail to credit it anywhere. If anyone out there knows the name of the song, post it here. Thanks."
5,Works Flawlessly,"I bought this cable to finally take advantage of the MIDI from an old Casio keyboard. I'm running the Casio into a Macbook Pro, and using the synths in Garageband. Everything is working great. No complaints."
5,Ready to go once you plug it in.,"I bought this cord for a Yamaha PSR-220. I plugged everything in, the usb part lit up, and Windows 7 64-bit searched for the driver and it was ready in 1 minute. The response time is very fast."
4,Nifty way to drive & receive MIDI signals from USB port,The cable provided a nifty way to drive and accept MIDI signals when you only have a USB port on your computer. I did notice a bit of lag in the action when pressing a key on the Roland MIDI keyboard and then hearing the sound from the speakers on the computer. But considering that I had no other method at hand for using MIDI with my computer it works pretty good.
4,Inexpensive Basic MIDI Interface,This basic midi interface works great. I used it to connect my E-Mu Proteus keyboard with my Mac. The connecting cables are long enough to give you some flexibility with placement of whatever it is you're connecting.
1,Buy the M-Audio MidiSport Uno instead!,"I needed a midi interface to update the firmware on my new Line 6 M13 pedalboard. After reading other reviews, I settled on this product. Much to my discontent the cable did not work for my application and I had to purchase a M-Audio Midisport Uno instead. The M-Audio cable worked perfectly the first time. It is unfortunate that I had to essentially spend $80 for one cable. I cannot comment on other uses for this product as I have not invested any more time into its applications, but if you are using it for a Line 6 update, STAY AWAY!"
4,Works well,"I'm pleased with this interface, and glad I spent a few extra bucks vs. the really cheap versions that sometimes are apparently hit or miss. No problems with Windows 7. Perfect for connecting a laptop into a midi setup. BTW, I put a small piece of foam around the USB connector which is made of hard plastic and contains the circuitry, as the cable would sometimes fall to the floor when unplugging from my laptop. I could imagine circuitry inside breaking over time if exposed to typical creative musician/road conditions... just don't think of it as being indestructable like a typical audio or midi cable."
3,"Work great, for a short time","I purchased this to connect a Rock Band 3 pro guitar to my Macbook pro for use in Garage Band. It worked pretty well, I had full functionality using the controller much like you would use a keyboard- very fun! Sadly, the cable seemed to wear out in a few short months, and the lack of speed in the connection meant that I had some signal loss. I think I will look for a higher quality cable now that I know how much fun I can have with that controller. I recommend this for light use, or for someone needing to experiment before spending money on a better product."
5,Works great,"I'm using this for remote control of a Behringer DEQ2496 through my PC. It works right out of the box with Seoman's software:[...]I really have no complaints, there was no software installation required, nothing at all actually, I just plugged it in, fired up Seoman's remote software, and everything worked as expected. I couldn't be more pleased. This is on a 32-bit Windows 7 PC."
5,Very Simple to use,"My computer does not have a MIDI port so I was looking for a simple, inexpensive way to connect my MIDI controller/keyboard and the EM8780 is exactly that. I am running Windows Vista and did not have any trouble with the drivers. I use Finale and did not have to do anything to the settings for the MIDI input to be recognized. This is a great product."
4,works great after some troubleshooting,"I used this with my macbook (07') and a Yamaha psr-275. It took a little bit to figure out, but it worked great once I:a)realized that I had to check my midi controller preferences on my mac andb)actually had to REVERSE my in and out midi jacks on the keyboard. I'm not sure if it's the cable or the keyboard, but I did read on one of the several forums that someone switched the cable in and outs and it worked.This took me quite a bit of time and research to figure out but once I did, it was pretty cool to use my garageband keyboard effects on a physical keyboard."
5,MIDI Interface,"I research MIDI Interfaces for a week. There are many MIDI Interfaces for $5.00. The reviews were discouraging. Poor quality cables, software not included. Software didn't work with music program. EMU had a high rating. It was true Plug and Play. No problem."
5,An absolute necessity,This item was needed for a special organ midi connection of the VTPO variety...I could not have accomplished my goal without it..I reccommend this item for all connections regarding Miditzer and Hauptwerk midi compatibility...it works 100% to my satisfaction......
3,Does not work with Microkorg Sound Editor.,"This MIDI interface doesn't work with the Microkorg Sound Editor. I'm not sure if this is due to poor programming on Korg's end or if there is some fault in the MIDI interface. I tried using it with multiple computers, downloaded all kinds of drivers and also tried to use compatibility mode settings.It did work fine with every other MIDI software I used though.I bought a new MIDI interface of a different brand and that one worked fine with the MK Sound Editor."
4,"Worked as advertized, but the picture is for an older model","Just plugged it into my WinXP laptop (which instantly recognized the USB device), fired up my MIDI utility and bingo - was able to send and receive MIDI from my synth. No complaints at all.Note that all of the electronics are in the USB connector (including an LED that blinks when there is MIDI activity.) (The unit I received was a newer model than the one in the picture - which shows the electronics in the middle of the cable rather than in the USB connector.) Of course that means the LED may not be easy to see if the USB cable is plugged into the back of your PC. However, most folks would only want to see the LED if they were trying to diagnose communication problems anyway - e.g. while setting up their MIDI drivers, etc."
5,"Expensive, but it works","At first I tried the similar generic no-name alternative (which rejoices in the name of ""USB MIDI Cable Converter PC to Music Keyboard Window Win Vista XP, Mac OS""), available on Amazon for around $6. Could not get it to work on any operating system: XP, Vista, Windows 7. Returned that and shelled out $30 for this one. What a difference! This one just worked right out of the box. Windows 7 installed the drivers automatically and it appears as a Midi device that I can choose in my Synth programs as the Midi In Device. Now my Midi keyboards can play the onboard synth in my PC. Sometimes you just get what you pay for."
4,Product works with 64 bit (problems with seller),"I read in numerous reviews that the cheaper MIDI adapters wouldn't work with 64 bit Windows 7. This item was just plug and play and I had no issues.Unfortunately I never received the initial shipment. I contacted Amazon five days after the expected delivery date, and they gave me reimbursement as well as free one-day shipping on a second order."
3,Acceptable,"Product works OK on Mac OS x 10.6, although one would do well to read up on MIDI configuration of OS X beforehand. Was also a little disappointed that it is a USB 1.1 device--not USB 2.0."
4,"Quirky Driver Install, Otherwise Excellent","I searched quite a bit for the best price on a USB-MIDI adapter initially until I read some reviews of cheaper units which suggested greater latency with them. Anybody familiar with the original MIDI interface knows that it is already burdened with enough latency to be noticeable, however I was very pleased to find that the Xmidi introduces very little additional latency. For that reason alone, it is WELL WORTH THE EXTRA COST to purchase a quality product from a company that has been in the electronic music business for decades.I only subtracted a star for the quirky driver installation, being that the packaging didn't ship with drivers at all. For some reason it also didn't want to be properly recognized in one of my USB ports either, but it's not the first USB device to do that and could just as easily be the fault of my motherboard as the Xmidi. Food for thought nonetheless."
2,This really wasn't what I thought it was....,Well it was but it wasn't it doesn't do exactly what I thought it would do I wanted this to try to pull recorded music off my Yamaha keyboard but instead it only hooks up to a computer to record new music that you play not prerecorded stuff that you already played.
5,Midi Interface for Garage Band Needed,I found a Casio keyboard at a local garage sale. I purchased this item to interface with my Garage Band software. The item has worked great.
4,Length was a bit misleading...,"The advertised length was 3 meters, but due to the way it's setup it only has a useful length of about 1.8 meters/6 feet, which is a bit disappointing as it doesn't reach my computer. Other than it's great, though."
4,Works with Yamaha keyboard,"I bought this device to connect my Yamaha PSR-280 synthesizer to a Windows XP computer via USB. I had to download the drivers from Emu.com, but after that, Cakewalk Home Studio was able to communicate with the keyboard via MIDI. I was previously using an old Soundblaster sound card, but that card didn't work with the newer computer I put it in. Switching to a USB device was a very easy, affordable alternative to an expensive sound card or external Midi interface box. As another reviewer said, the Out plug sometimes plugs into the In port on the keyboard; just try both options and one should work."
2,Not good for SysEx on Roland MT-32,"I used this device with the Roland MT-32 on Windows XP. With either the built-in Microsoft driver or the latest EMU driver downloaded from their website, SysEx messages were not conveyed to the MT-32, resulting in music playing with incorrect instruments. Currently, I am using the M-Audio Uno sans driver and having no problems."
5,Works great with iMac and GarageBand,"Literally, plug and play. No hassles. Took the cable out of the box, connected it to my Yamaha P90 keyboard and launched GarageBand from Intel iMac. GB found the keyboard without any problem. No software or drivers needed to be loaded. Decent price also."
5,Works fine,"This is a great way to hook up a MIDI keyboard to your computer without installing extra sound cards. The software was easy to install. The cable connects to the MIDI device and plugs into any available USB port on the computer. My MIDI keyboard is in the next room, so I'm also using a USB extension cable and it still works fine."
4,The book......,My almost 4 year old son loves Scooby Doo so we have to have the books for his favorite VHS tapes we watch. He likes the book. I think it's cute too. Can't go wrong for the price.
2,Very Very outdated,"This book is very outdated; it does however contain the best ads of that period. Could be valuable for researchers or for students, but of no integral value to a practitoner. As soon as I saw the book I felt that I had wasted some money."
5,Absolutely Awesome,"I read this book expecting a lot of ""war"" data. But what I received was far beyond what I expected. It was fantastic. It did just what it set out to do, which was capture the comradry and the ""Two Souls Indivisible"" and their plights together. I have the pleasure of knowing Fred Cherry and he is a wonderful man. After reading the book, I have another level of respect for him and what he has accomplished."
5,"Two Souls, a fascinating and inspiring read","I found this to be a fascinating and inspirational account of how two men, and their compatriots used their determination and creative skills to help one another survive the ordeal of prisoners of war in North Vietnam for over 7 years. There is much to be learned from how these men responded to very adverse conditions."
1,Not worth it.,"Let's be realistic here; parents buy a potty video to help teach the child. Having read enough about what the parent is to do, I bought this video for my twin girls thinking it was a 30 minute (per the box) or so video designed to teach all aspects of the potty to the child. The children's video is about 5 minutes; another five minutes of ""credits"" and the remainder, and clear majority of the video is parental advice. I returned it the same day in favor of a video that would take longer than five minutes to teach my girls all aspects of this important ritual."
4,Once upon a potty for her,"I borrowed this tape from a friend who had great success with this video. My daughter is almost two and has had on again off again success on her own. When I viewed this tape for the first time, I too had somewhat of the same reaction as the reviewer who found it a bit moronic. However, after viewing it a few more times and explaining to my daughter where her potty is (obviously not the same type as in the video...I too, have never seen this type of contraption), she loves it.She has fun dancing tothe ""potty song"" and overall I would rate this video in a favorable way as part of the entire process of toilet training."
3,If you like the book...,I had this book for my daughters and now the DVD for a granddaughter...she watched about 5 minutes and didn't really care for it...I think it is cute....but the little one had no interest :)
5,We love Prudence,"I have three potty videos and this is the favorite. Whenever my two year old wants to see the ""potty video"", this is the one she wants. She loves to watch Prudence learn to use the potty. The music and songs are pretty catchy too (in fact I find myself singing them hours and days later!) My only complaints are that child's portion ends too quickly and the doctor is stilted and a little intimidating."
2,once upon a potty for her,"We bought this book, and my daughter loved the book. I thought the video might make more of an impact, so I bought that too. It didn't really do any good. She likes to watch it, but she doesn't enjoy the potty song at the end of the cartoon, and the cartoon is only about 8 minutes long. I would buy the book again, but not the video."
2,Too Many Diapers,"I bought this video when my daughter was potty training. We had the book already, and she loved that, so I thought that this might keep her sitting on the potty a bit longer. I was disappointed by the only live-action children wearing their diapers to sit on the potty. Who wears diapers to sit on a potty? However, she did love the video, and continued to sing the Potty Song for long after she had been potty trained. I will not buy the boys version for my son, as there are better training tools out there."
1,Not impressed,"By the time you get through all the credits you end up with about 5 minutes of instruction for your child. It took more time putting the tape in and rewinding than for my child to watch it. When she saw that I spent a lot of time rewinding, she became uninterested in it."
3,"pretty good, but incorrect anatomy references","I used the one for boys for my son and really liked it, as it uses a fun approach to potty learning (unlike the shaming approach used by Potty Power). I was delighted that it also explained anatomy a little, on a 2 year old level. I was very disappointed in the one for girls, though, as the video says that they have a ""peepee for making weewee"". Huh? That's just confusing."
5,Really working!,I heard about this from a friend who said it was working for her son and she was right. My daughter (2 yrs 3 mths) loves to watch it and has been using the potty regularly since we got it. She has a while to go but it's working and she loves song.
1,Not worth the price,"The video is way too short and outdated. It's maybe worth $5.00, not $15.00 like I paid!"
3,OK but doesn't hold her interest,This DVD is OK but doesn't hold my 2 year olds interest for very long. She prefers the Go Potty Go DVD over this one.
2,Could be better.,"This movie is ok for potty training. The song is catchy, kids like watching other kids so it's fun for them to watch. The actual story is lacking though. It's about 7 minutes long and Prudence only ever feels the need to go ""poo poo"" and never has to urinate but always seems to when she has a bm. Also, she spends most of the video bottomless. It would be nice if she had to urinate sometimes and had to pull down her pants - had an accident once, got it right once - because come let's face it, that's what happens. Then at the end when she's ""using it all the time"" that's it. She pulls on some panties while introducing the song. I'd prefer a big celebration and a big deal made out of her being able to leave the diapers behind and use big girl panties.My daughter likes it but it could be better."
1,Waste of money,I was very excited when I ordered this DVD. When my daughter and I sat down to watch it I was VERY disappointed. This kept my daughters attention for 2.5 seconds and she loves to watch movies. This was a complete waste of money and she learned absolutely nothing about using the potty .
1,Doesn't teach,"I needed some help teaching my 2 1/2 year old to use the potty, so I got this video. It didn't help at all - the kids on there are BABIES who sit on the potty with their diaper on. This is all my daughter wanted to do after watching the video. There is one part where ""Prudence"" puts the potty on her head, which my daughter also wanted to do. It'd be more helpful it if taught kids of the right age how to pull their pants down, sit on the potty, then afterwards WASH THEIR HANDS. No mention of toilet paper at all, either. This was a complete waste of money and time for us."
4,Great Inspiration to little girls,"I bought this video last year when my older daughter (then 2 1/2yrs) had stalled at potty training. Immediately after she watched this video we started to see results. She insisted on watching it many times over the course of the day and even made me learn ""the Potty Song"" so I could sing it to her. (And the song is kind of catchy.) Now that my younger daughter (at 2yrs old) has shown an interest in training, she too has fallen under the spell of Prudence. Both girls love to dance to the music and point to the babies they see in the beginning of the video. I had thought that with my younger daughter's health condition (Leukemia) she wouldn't want to potty train now, but the video has helped her get into the mood.Buy this video!"
2,Not What I Expected,"I agree with many of the semi-negative reviews on this video.I was shocked at the copyright date of 1990 as I would have put this video around 1984. The potties look ancient! The kids have to straddle them. The kids sitting on them look no more than 18 months old and have diapers on. Who told the writers of ""The Potty Song"" that kids call urine ""wee wee""? My daughter was like ""uh what's that?""Prudence only uses the potty once and it is pee and poo all at once. She is naked when she uses it, doesn't wipe herself or wash her hands.My daughter mostly laughed at the babies running around and placing potties on their heads (oh yeah, that's educational) and that crazy song they are dancing to that is stuck in my head ALL DAY at work.I think it's time for a new generation video that is a little more PC shall we say than this is."
1,"Only if you want to hear a horrible ""potty song""","Since your child will want to watch it again and again, choose your potty-teaching video wisely. ""Bear in the Big Blue House"" is MUCH better all around. Clever, fun songs (5 of them!), no cutesey words for body parts (""Once..."" explains that pee-pee comes out of your wee-wee, whereas in ""Bear..."" one simply poops, the word we use in our house). One up-side for ""Once..."": for parents who have questions about when and how to being potty-teaching, there is a much more informative section AFTER the kid's video, but you may want to fast-forward through the awful ""Potty Song."""
2,"Bottom line: it's outdated, and you will be disappointed.","I am so glad that I rented this from the library rather than had it purchased from here based on mostly positive reviews. The video and animation is very low quality, and they'll especially be bad if you view it on an HDTV. I am annoyed that they recycle the ""music video"" and show it twice in this very short DVD.. and even WITHIN the video they recycle clips! Very, very sad. If there's any redeeming quality to this, it's the animation portion. I would love to see an updated, expanded, corrected (not wiping/washing hands as other pointed out) version of this, but as it currently stands, not worth more than a $2 investment if found at Goodwill."
5,THIS WORKED GREAT,"I BOUGHT THIS TAPE FOR MY 2 1/2 YEAR OLD GRANDSON IT WAS VERY HELPFUL AND EASY FOR HIM TO UNDERSTAND. HE LOVED IT, AND TRAINED IN ABOUT A MONTHS TIME. ALL HE KEPT SAYING IS: ""NO BIRD BATH"". I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. MY DAUGHTER HAS TOLD ALL HER FRIENDS ABOUT IT."
2,Only first half is good,The first half is entertaining. But I'm not sure if it has educational value. The second half is very very bad. The doctor in psychology who gives instructions is very unappealing. He has not even smile once in his about 10 minute lecture. I'm wondering how any child can stand watching such a face.
1,don't waste the money,"I am so glad I borrowed this video from the library instead of spending good money to own this bore. The story dramatization lasts but 5 minutes. All the rest is annoying filler. The sing along potty song will immediately irritate you. The parental information contained in the second half of this you probably already know or already have in one of your other parenting books. A better choice would be ""The Potty Book For Girls"""
2,My two year old wasn't buyin' it.,"The potty used in the video is not like the potties on the market now. And the babies dancing around the potty are cute and held her interest, but they look a little young to be potty training."
1,Just Plain Awful,"I had my heart set on buying this video and also the boys version for my two children, ages 2 and 3. I was about to make the purchase, but before I did I went to the library and checked out the VHS of Once Upon a Potty.I am so disappointed. The actual story portion of the tape is probably about 5 or 10 minutes at the most. The rest of the kids portion of the tape- another 5 or 10 minutes- is the stupid potty song. This tape grates on my nerves so much I have to leave the room when the kids are watching it.I hope that it produces the desired result which is helping my daughter understand and show interest in potty-training. Quite frankly I would never buy this tape because there must be less painful ways for parents to go through the training process with their toddlers. I am going to buy a couple of books instead."
4,Unadulterated Cat,"I bought this for my wife, and she really enjoys this Author. I will try to get more of his books."
4,The true cat,A marvelous book. Easy to read and a laugh from beginning to end. The only experience I felt he missed was the 'bathing the cat' experience but ... do real cats have baths?
3,"not his best work, but fun","If you're a cat lover, you will like this, but it is not Terry Pratchett's best work by a long shot. It seems more like something he wrote over a weekend."
3,Pratchett Cat Humor,"The Unadulterated Cat is a slight book, a set of cat humor pieces written by Terry Pratchett and illustrated by Gray Joliffe. There's nothing wrong about the book per se - the humor isn't bad and the scratchy illustrations fit the book well - but there's nothing particularly interesting about it either; it's basic and only occasionally original cat/pet humor. Entertaining, but not really worth picking up unless you're big on cat humor or a Pratchett completionist."
1,A disappointing cliche.,"I'm a big fan of Sir Terry Pratchett, so I was really looking forward to enjoying his take on cats. However, it was a huge disappointment. The book is one long cliche from beginning to end, and it reads like a cheap Douglas Adams knockoff. I guess I should have noticed it was printed in the early 1990s, before Pratchett really hit his stride. Skip this one and pick up one of his Tiffany Aching stories instead."
1,Not the Pratchett of Discworld,"First, I think Terry Pratchett is a masterful writer. Second, cat fanciers are boring when enraptured by the small furry pests despite being masterful writers. This is no Discworld, I did not find it entertaining enough to bother to read the whole thing. Ansel Adams probably would bore you with photos of his kids. Speilburg would probably bore you with his home movies."
3,"when it's good, it's very very good","every cat owner will love this book, but it's definitely not pratchett at the top of his game.the good bits are inspired, hilarious, side-splitting and absolutely accurate (i can write this because my cats are not in the room).but there are spots where the humor is labored, or even absent.some of the illustrations are enjoyable, but i can't say i'm thrilled with any.still, when you're not reading discworld novels, this will do."
3,They don't make them like they used to,"I've been using OptiVisors for over 20 years, and I do remember when they were a quality product. The visor is secured to the adjustable head band by two plastic nuts on either side on the band. Unfortunately, one of those two nuts was defective and frequently fell out, causing the visor to slip down and hit my nose. I finally went to the local hardware store and found a couple of plastic pieces, which are now keeping it in place. The lenses, which are a very high quality, are held in place with plastic pins with a knob on the end.) The plastic didn't held the lens in place, so I did replace the plastic dowels with a couple of small nuts and bolts. Now the OptiVisor functions perfectly.Do I recommend this product? Yes. The quality of the lens is superb. If you buy it and have the problems with it that I have, know you can get the fix-it parts at your local hardware store."
3,missing headscrews,"I have used items like this before, for my work. I sent a pair to my dad, who's vision is bad. He just got them, and said the screws/knobs on each side of the band are not in the box... wondering whether it's worth sending back (was this a previously purchased item and maybe returned, in a lighter condition?).. may not be worth the time, travel to p.o., postage, etc."
3,Hit and Miss for Free,"This 2cd set is kind of disappointing. The 1st CD has good sound -it is somewhat stereo and contains alternate cuts of Free but none come from their last 3 albums. The 2nd CD is very disappointing. It is a live recording which sounds like a bad bootleg. The sound is muffled in a lot of places and hard to hear clearly. They should have left this one out. There is even the sound of a phone ringing or a alarm in the background on a couple of the cuts. Free fans--just get this for the 1st cd--the other is very very bad. Where are the cuts from the last lineup of Free--are they out there-Hearbreaker, Catch a Train etc?"
3,Still Surprised,"Even after reading all of the earlier reviews concerning the poor recording on the second disc, I gave it a shot anyway and was actually surprised. It's even worse than I had expected. I can't imagine what they were thinking when they included this material. The first disc is a solid 4 star but if you're not a hardcore fan, I would skip this and go straight to ""Free Live""."
3,Just So-So,"I bought this book because I wanted to see how the secret socities are in operation today. It's a historic presentation that happened in the 1700's, 1800's and early to mid 1900's. However, it became sort of silly after a while to keep uncovering the activities of societies that are no longer in existence. From the reporting side it seems ligit, I'd rather have a more current expose' of the societies in action today."
2,Capitalizing on stupidity,"It's funny to watch fame-driven scandalous reporters write exposes in America. Most recently, there was the Fahrenheit 911, an alleged expose of President Bush. Upon a closer examination, the film's collage of footage and the conclusions derived therefrom were mostly meaningless. Similarly with this book. The book comes up with assorted and scandalous-sounding allegations. However, anyone with a reasonable mind and keen perception will come to question most of it.What I most certainly do not doubt is that the author, more than any secret societies, is seeking to gain money and the opposite sex's attention, something that a scandalous 'expose' will doubtlessly accomplish."
5,Information Overload!,"This books has everything you ever wanted to know about Mages in the Umbra and then some. This book gives much needed information on what happened to the Masters that were trapped in the Umbra when the Avatar Storms tore the worlds apart and gives some hints one what os to come in the future.Especially useful are the various discriptions of the many Umbra Realms and planes, as well as those that dwell there. The rotes are a very useful tool to get past the Avatar Storm and also give ways to travel around the Umral realms.The downside to this book however is the lack of MET conversions. But the infomation jammed into this book alone makes it well worth the loss anyway."
3,Jump annoying,"Sure, it's 6th grade, but most of the infromation on the CD happens to have around a 85% chance that the topics are even in your schools, at least not in MO.... so I'd rate this at *** stars at best."
2,A Book Worthy of Edgar Rice Burroughs,"The idea of a ""Lost World"" somewhere on Earth is by no means new, however, in this day & age, is somewhat dated.In reality this is an interesting idea but is only averagly written. We would accept this from a book written in the 1930's but not really from one written in 1997.I can only recommend this as a book to read if you've run out of everything else."
2,dinotopia is a lost cause.,"Dinoptopia lost was a short, rather boring book about a group of pirates who land on the shore of dinotopia. The plot is pointless and not enjoyable. Foster does not use much detail in describing the characters or the island, and the reader is left with a vague kind of hazy idea of what things are like. Illustrations would have been a big help. I did like the idea of the book (an islnad where dinosaurs and humans live together) but i think Foster could have done a better job with it."
5,Tlecommunication Essentials,"Lillian Goleniewski had touched almost all basic foundations of telecommunication. The explaination is very clear, brief and easy to digest. She managed to explain all the concepts in her own style which is free from complicated terms and jargons. I would say the book itself can be read by non-technical person or a very busy management person who would like to know about telecommunication. My conclusion, this book for every level of people regardless their background. As for network planner and network administrator, this book is good for them to read so that they would understand how the network works from end to end."
5,Making Telecom Understandable and Applicable,"I am a grad student at Wharton and we used this text for our Advanced Telecom class. Using this text made our class fun and helped us learned the cutting edge principles of telecom in an exciting way. The author explains the traditional and emerging areas of the field, and has a unique writing style which teaches technical details in an understandable manner. I would reccomend this book to anyone, including business people, academics, or anyone generally interested in learning more about telecommunication. Five stars!"
4,The best help I've had in finding the truth about the Ivies.,"This book holds no punches. It tells it like it is - from the students - on areas such as social life, drinking on campus, safety issues, various academic pros and cons, skill of profs, morale, racism, etc. Shows good differences between schools we think of as ""the same"" - eg, Yale, Princeton, Dartmouth. I like the charts too - they helped me find the information I wanted quickly and clearly. Strong recommendation."
2,"Heavy on theory, weak on application","You may find this book suitable if you are researching the theory behind AD implementation. It will provide you with high-level, high-brow planning. However, if you are looking for some applicable concepts to administering AD, you won't find them here. A more appropriate title may be ""Concepts and Theories of Active Directory"". If you can stay awake through this one, or thrive on project management, this may be worth you're while. However, if that's the case, read Microsoft's white papers instead."
2,"Noble Effort, Bad Results","As one of the many books to try to explain the complex subject of Active Directory, Brovick and his associates have churned out a disorganized effort. The first chapter begins by describing how a hypothetical organization would implement an Active Directory installation, including who should be in charge of which duties etc...which is actually a good idea, but not in the FIRST chapter. The book itself is riddled with typos and figures that do not demonstrate the concept that is being explained. In fact, one figure early on in Chapter 2 shows the opposite of what is trying to be explained. They also use terms freely before they define them leading to general confusion for a reader new to Active Directory. If you are already an expert, this book might be helpful. If you are not, stay away..."
2,Windows 2000 Active Directory,Suprisingly thin on practical information - poorly written (or edited to create more pages) - and not usable. Better to read the Whitepapers on Microsoft's web site....for theory - which is the true nature of this book.
2,Mixed,"After reading this book it felt as though it left a bitter taste. If I had the choice of reading this book again, I wouldn't. It is sour boring with the potential of being a master piece. I hate to give such a poor review to such a talented artist, but Ambroise Vollard just didn't capture the feeling I was looking for when I picked up this book. Bottom line, great artist, interesting topic but written in a hardcore stiff mannar that recieves a poor rating."
1,Propaganda piece,"I watched Relentless in the hopes of getting a primer on the Palestine-Isreali conflict. Unfortunately, what I found was a blatant propaganda piece. Although there are interviews with a variety of different pro-Israel speakers, they interview 1 representative of the Palestinian side for a total of about 30 seconds. The movie is replete with tragic visuals of victims on the Israeli side, yet only 1 or 2 images of victims on the Palestinian side. Eventually, the movie concludes that Israel has only ever acted to protect itself, and any resulting civilian casualties on the Palestinian side are essentially the fault of the Palestinians for having bad leaders. I'm no expert on the Middle East, but it doesn't take much sophistication to recognize a one-sided piece of journalistic trash. If you like being brainwashed, I recommend you watch this so-called ""documentary""."
1,Inadequate Adaptation,"I teach 7th Grade English Language Arts to reluctant readers. This is a largely male group that usually enjoys the adventure aspects of the book ""Hatchet"" on which this movie is allegedly based. Generally, they are inspired to read when promised they can see the movie at the end. This offering, however, was such a poor adaptation of the book and so poorly realized, we almost didn't watch the entire thing. We finally decided to finish it so we could compare and contrast the two while giggling at the remarkably poor acting. We were very disappointed with the video and almost had a ""Cry"" ourselves. I decided to save my money; I'll just use the copy in the library if I ever decide to show ths awful thing again."
1,another kids reveiw,"This year in 6th grade I read and watched the story Hatchet. I thought the movie was pathetic. Hollywood probably didn't read the book. How could Gary Paulsen go from an awesome and descriptive book, to a lame and non-descriptive movie? Therefore, we liked the book better than the movie. We would not recommend the movie unless you haven't read the book. But, we would rather read the book more than watch the movie. It is a waste of time and money, to watch the movie. We would probably give the movie a half a star out of five if we could. We would give the movie a half a star because the movie was not as descriptive as the book. In the movie Brian had no cuts or bruises when he came out of the plane. Brian also was not very scared in the movie and was not very mature. Therefore we liked the book better than the pathetic and lame movie. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO to the movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Hatchet Review,"We are two 6th graders and we just finished reading the book Hatchet and watching the movie ""Cry in the Wild."" We give the movie one out five stars. The movie gave nowhere near the details as the book did. The movie did not put the events in proper order. We do not think you should watch the movie it would just be a waste of time. Over all we know the book was better than the movie. Personally we think the movie stunk."
1,Another Kids Review,"In the movie ""A Cry In The Wild"" it followed the story a little bit, but the rest is off topic. We did not like this movie because it was not anything like the book. The graphics are fake and Hollywood just wasted their time on this movie. Trust me it's boring too! So we give this movie a one out of five. Don't watch the movie it is horrible."
1,Another person's reveiw,"I am a 6th grader and I read the book Hatchet and saw the movie ""A Cry in the Wild"". Don't bother watching the movie, it is terrible. Why did they change the title anyway? And by the way, the graphics weren't that good. The events are in the wrong sequence. Brian did not have a scratch when he woke up on shore in the movie. The movie is terrible. The book, however, I would recommend strongly. It has amazing details and is very realistic. It even has the Newberry honor. Don't see the movie, read the Book!P.S. Brian in the book did not have long hair but in the movie did. DON'T WATCH THE MOVIE!!!"
1,Another Kid's Review,We disliked the movie! We thought it was horrible. It was horrible because the movie had no detail what so ever. The movie did not follow the book very well. It didn't follow the book well because it took out the moose attack and the instead of a tornado it had gale winds. Instead of a moose that attacked Brian; there was a bear that attacked Brian. In the book it does not say anything about a bear attacking Brian. We would give the movie a 1 out of 5 stars. We would recommend the book rather than the movie.
1,Another kids Review,"We are two 6th graders and we just finished watching ""Cry in the Wild."" Our personal opinion is that the movie is HORRIBLE! The movie had no details like the book. The book had a lot of details. After the crash Brian had no injuries. He didn't even have a scratch. In the movie but in the book he did. We can't believe how horrible the movie was. The movie kind of changed things around from the book. The movie didn't follow the book as well as it could have. The book was called Hatchet. We give it 1 star out of 5."
1,Another kids review,"I like the novel by Gary Paulson so much better than the movie called the CRY IN THE WILD. This movie was so bad I should not even give it a grade, let alone a grade at all. The reason I hated the movie more than the book is because. There was no detail in it. And the movie did not fallow the book vary good. Like when Brain the charter when he chased he did not have a single scratch on him in the movie. At least in the book it sounded like Brain had gotten hurt. I am speechless. I bet these people are trying to get your money. I reedmen that you get the book. I would give it 1 out of 5From,Another kids review"
1,This movie is NOT appropriate for 5th grade students,"I rented the movie to show to my students after we read the novel. It cut out most of the good stuff from the book, had cussing in it, and was awful. Needless to say, I didn't let the kids watch it. We just got into groups, chose our favorite scenes and worked up minidramas to act out. Don't buy this movie."
1,Disappointed Buyer!!!!!!!,"I am VERY unsatisfied with my purchase. They posted this movie as if it were the film for the book Hatchet by Gary Paulson. What they sent me was some slasher movie. I had kids who read the book. They were extremely disappointed that I didn't receive the correct movie. I would expect my money back at least, or a copy of the correct movie. I ordered A Cry in the Wild. I did not get that. The pictured DVD is not the one I received."
2,Not too sure,"I love the book Hatchet and we have read it in my 5th grade class this year. The movie follows the book pretty closely. The only struggle I really had were the curse words that were present. I know the movie was made in the 1990's but it was frustrating to show a movie about the Novel ""Hatchet"" and then not having a clean movie to show my students."
4,A Cry in the Wild DVD movie review,"Movie was shot several decades ago, but I bought it to show my middle school kids after we read the book, Hatchet. With that book in our minds, we found the movie to be pretty good. It was good to teach the students how different a book can be from a movie."
2,Movie compared to the Book,"While the movie wasn't nearly as good as the book, it was an excellent teaching tool for my fifth graders. Many are reluctant readers. After reading the book and viewing the movie, the book won hands down. Mission accomplished. Although the movie was somewhat of a disappointment, the service I received was excellent. If I need to purchase movies or materials for my classroom in the future, amazon.com will be one of my first stops."
2,Another Persons Review,"We believe the book, Hatchet, was better than the movie Cry in the Wild, by a long shot. Our expectations of the movie were high because the book was so good. We were disappointed by how much different the movie was from the book Hatchet. We did not like the movie, because we were expecting to see something like the book. It was nothing like the book. We will always recommend the book over the movie. The book gave us more details and description so we could make a picture in our mind. We give it a rating of 2 out of 5."
3,Another kids review,"We are 2 kids in sixth grade and we just watched the movie ""A Cry In The Wild."" Before that we read the book ""Hatchet"". We would give the movie a rating of 3 stars. The movie made up for all the parts it deleted but those parts were all boring! The only part we liked was when the bear gave Brian a hug. We would recommend that you read the book first and then watch the movie to see which one is better, you might agree with us afterwards."
1,Another kid's Review,"After reading the book Hatchet and watching the movie ""Cry in the Wild"", the book was great. I expected a lot from the movie but I think it didn't even cut it. The reason I say this is because the movie didn't follow the book at all. The movie is very unrealistic. The screenwriters changed major events and took out tons of details. I'm shocked that Gary Paulsen was a screenwriter. Teachers, kids and adults stick with the book. Do watch the movie, because then you can see that Hollywood's changes aren't always good."
2,Not what I thought,"My wife is a sixth grade teacher and they are just finishing the book Hatchet. We rented this movie thinking she could watch it in her class, but we were wrong. Half way through the movie we realized it is PG and she would not show it to her class. It would be a good compare and contrast due to the fact that there are many differences between the book and movie. We are glad that we reviewed it at home first."
1,What a disappointment!,"This movie was a BIG disappointment! I bought it to show to my 4th grade class after we read the book Hatchet. Well, unfortunately this movie is not suitable for viewing in school. Although the book did not have any profanity in it - the movie definitely does!"
1,Another kid's review,"Hatchet was a book about survival, life and finding out who you really are. Now the movie... that's another story. The movie seemed like it wasn't hard to survive in the wild. And it wasn't like the book, Brian doing things like stabbing a bear!? From the scale 1 to 5 I would give the movie less than one."
2,A cry in the wild was too wild for me!,"I am a fifth grader and watched this movie in class. My whole class and I agree that it was graphic. There was lots of blood and nude scenes. I think it should have been a PG-13 rating, and shouldn't be shown in elementary or middle school. It is more violent and bloody than the movies my older brother and my mom watch. It was a MAJOR disappointment."
2,Cry in the Wild vs A Cry in the Wild,"This DVD was paired with the book Hatchet on the Amazon site so I bought both items. However, I found out that this is not the movie that goes with Hatchet. The DVD I bought is ""Cry in the Wild"" The one that SHOULD be paired with Hatchet is ""A Cry in the Wild"". Now because I already opened it, I am stuck with a DVD I can't use."
1,cry in the wild,This movie is not what we thought we were getting. this movie is not showing a picture when you order. It is not about the young boy surviving in the wilderness!!!
3,Hatchet,"It's a great too if a teacher wants the pupil to do a comparison between the book and film. I've used it to prompt a couple of students into reading the book by showing just the first part of the film. The film avoids the suicide attempts, divorce, and the moose."
3,Slow movie,"This movie is ok. It is very slow moving, but the story is a good one about survival and resilience."
3,A Cry in the Wild,"I bought the DVD for my students to watch after we read the book Hatchet. The movie was ok, but I really wish Hollywood would make a better version (closer to the book) of this movie. This is a book that is read by thousands of students each year."
3,too expensive for a not so good film,I used this film with my students after reading Hatchet. I paid way too much for this DVD and the film was just okay. My students said that the book was much better.
1,Another kid's revieew,HatchetIn our 6th grade ELA class we watched the movie and read the book of Hatchet. The book blows the movie out of the water the move is junk. You should still watch the movie after you read the book so you can compare them. I know you will think the book is better and the movie is junk.
2,another kids revew,"Cry in the wild review2 out 5 starsWe give this movie 2 out of 5 stars because they made up about 85% of the movie and they only took about 5 parts out of the book. We cannot believe that Gary Paulsen was a screenwriter. We believe that Gary Paulson is a better writer at books than movies. Watch the movie but don't expect a lot from the movie. Do not buy the movie, rent the movie first."
1,Confusing Advertising,"I intended to order the movie based on the novel Hatchet. This was not it; however, it was on the same page, with the same title. I thought it was the movie I wanted available in DVD format instead of VHS, so I ordered it. I think that this movie SHOULD NOT be listed on the same page as the one based on the novel Hatchet. Thankfully, I was able to return it for a refund, but I still had to pay the shipping costs."
1,Another kid's reveiw,"My two other partners and I agree, that the movie ""Cry in the Wild"" was not the movie of the year. Hatchet the book was a million times better than the movie that seemed as if it came out of a dumpster. There weren't as many details as there were in the book. For instance they didn't include the moose attack, which was one of our favorite parts in the novel. Another thing that took the zest out of it was there were way to many differences. If you hate movies that don't have the main characters close to the ones described in the books forget it. And the movie seemed pretty quiet because they didn't express his thoughts. If you still want to see this movie, completely denying our review go ahead, but rent it. Don't waste this much money on it. We give it 1 star. And that's being generous!"
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this to show to a classrooom of students after completing the novel, Hatchet. The movie had several places in it where the film was not acceptable. The students and I were very disappointed."
4,Mom of 4,We purchased the For Her and it worked great for our daughter. Potty For Him didn't work for our son. I know it was his personality and not the product.
4,very short,"my 22mo. old loves this, every time he goes potty he has to watch the video, but it is very short, the movie is only 7 minutes. I recommend renting this."
1,THIS VIDEO IS SO LAME,"My kids did not even want to sit through this, it was so bland, boring and bad. Also, the music is beyond lame. I think this video may help my kids fall into a deep sleep--but it is definitely not going to get them potty trained. I much prefer Elmo's potty video."
3,Not Worth It,"I purchased this after hearing both positive and negative things about the video. The video itself is short. Yes, it tells the same story as in the book, but not much more. After the very short potty film their is a pretty useless montage of babies and the potty song. Afterwards, commentary for the parents. It is not useful for young children if you ask me. Once my kids got into the movie itself it was over and I had to rewind--but not too far because the movie itself is so short. The book is better. Some parents have had success with this video. I didn't, but it is short and to the point so some kids might get it."
5,This stands the test of time.,I used the book to help potty train my son 26 years ago and when I saw the video I knew I had to buy it for my great-nephew who is 2. He is not quite ready to be potty trained but we have a good time watching together. It is not a how to potty train video in my opinion but helps to introduce the idea of potty training to a child. I just bought another copy for my other nephew!
3,A little like a trip to another dimension,"I purchased this on the recommendation of my sister not really thinking about the fact her kids are much older than mine. Whoa! First off, the narration in the beginning is super strange and pretty annoyting. I never looked @ when it was made but I am guessing mid 1980's. On the plus side, the kids loved it. They learned nothing about going potty but it was a good diversion.I have to say, this is one of the weirdest videos I have seen, with the exception of the clip shown on ""The Soup"" featuring a french (I assume potty video) of toddlers farting and pooping and getting poop on them"
3,Too short...Too simple,"We liked the book and rented the video from Blockbuster video. We were dissappointed because the ""Potty song"" was much longer than the story. My son liked the video, but there's a lot more for him to learn about going to the potty than is offered here. It's a good introduction to potty learning."
3,"Very short and not entertaining, but gets the point across","I borrowed this video from the library and am glad I did. The actual section for the kids was very short and simple. They go through the basics. The animation is kind of cardboard-like, so don't expect this video to be entertaining or have a storyline. I didn't bother watching the parent's section. However the video must have worked because my son started insisting on the toilet."
1,Rent it before you buy it.,"I borrowed this video along with other Potty Training videos from the library. This was my least favorite. I instead highly recommend ""Its Potty Time""."
3,Disappointed,"I bought this for my 2 year old son and it helped a little bit but it gave him a thought about putting the small potty on his head like wearing a hat, the video shows children doing that and my son picked that up and quit using the small potty and will only use the ""Big Potty"" and I think that if he were still using the little potty he would be completely potty-trained. In my opinion this video did more harm than good and its also way too short for children to get interested in... This is just my opinion... I hope this opinion helped.."
3,It gets the point across... but....,"This video does a good job of making very clear the point of what the potty is for... good for very early parts of training. BUT... the video is very short, the parents section is not very good at all, and the format of the video is tacky. I know it is hard to keep some sense of decorum while discussing bodily functions, but this video was really not necessary."
2,Okay dvd,saw all the good reviews and purchased this for my 2 1/2 yr old son.very dissapointed the whole dvd is less then 7minutes long and doesnt really emphasize on how to potty trainingthe song was cute but not so catchy
5,great DVD,I love this DVD - I used it for my daughter and she got potty training right away. Ordered this for my son (boy's version) and they both sing and dance to it. The dvd helps them understand what potty training is all about.
4,very detailed,my son watched this video and out of all the ones I had gotten him this is the only one that actually showed him what his body was doing. He understood aolt better after watching this.
4,nice start,"good introduction to the potty training process, however in retrospect would prefer a tape which shows how things go all the way to using the toilet. this is because many preschools, if not all, do not have potties. so the mere fact that your child uses the potty perfectly is not enough, he needs to be able to use the toilet to go to preschool."
1,Really?,"I bought this DVD to try to get my 2 year old son more excited about using the big boy potty.I couldn't even get him to watch this movie. He watched the openning song and then walked away when it stopped. The babies in the video aren't even old enough to walk.They put the potty on their head - which is the last thing I want my son to start doing...When they show the cartoon boy's ""penis & hole"" my husband and I both responded with ""really?""...I am all for teaching your children about their body - but I think we are going to hold off on using the word ""penis"" until he is old enough to speak in complete sentences.Great for parents that are ok with using that terminology at such a young age or have older children - but it wasn't for us."
1,"Boring, Short and too graphic","First of all this video is too short, it shows the same thing over and over and it gets old really fast. Neither me or my son can stand to watch it more than a couple of times. The song is kind of catchy, but it gets old fast too. The potty does look different from any kinds I have seen as well. On another note, it shows it in his diaper when he has gone potty, I mean isn't that a little much? I think its just plain gross and my son probably didn't even know what it was supposed to be anyways. I know one of the reviewers said the kids looked too young but some of them looked too old too. I swear one of the kids in it looks like hes four. I wouldn't waste your money on this video, the repetetive nature of it bores the child too quickly."
1,You know what.......,You know what? This movie gave my kids nightmares. They were afraid of Mr' Hanky from South PArk. But this movie made them even more scared then of Mr. Hanky.
3,It's not the best,"I recommend Potty Time with Bear (Bear in the Big Blue House) more than this one, but this one is pleasant. My son (just barely 2) watched it and liked it. But I agree with the other reviewers that it is very short."
1,Don't waste your money or your time,"Why would you show babies (not toddlers but crawlers) playing with potties, putting them on their heads etc? Why suggest that's what you do with potties? Story isn't instructional. Also we don't use the words wee-wee & poo-poo. Not at all useful. There are much better videos available."
1,Once Upon a Potty for Him,I do not recommend this video to anyone. It is only five minutes long and is a waste of money. The video shows a few sketches of cartoon and keep repeating it like there is no new skteches that are available. I find this annoying. My 16 months old walk away after watching for less than two minutes in three separate viewing...
3,okay,"pros - the steps are clear and its attractive (to my son at least). cons - the introduction the babies names is unnecessary. viewers dont need to see 20 babies and their names one by one. its even twice longer than the show itself! btw, this is much better dvd than the overpriced elmo potty time dvd."
5,This really works,I potty trained both of my children with this video and have now purchased it for my grandson. Highly recommended and I received it in just a few days of ordering.
2,Not so great!,"We had not read the book before purchasing this video. The babies in the video are very, very young, as in hardly up on their feet, let alone using the potty. They start with The Potty Song, the story is short and uses silly words like wee-wee and then they end with The Potty Song. The Potty Song is back to the babies playing and not making much sense. If your child is very young and uses the potty, they might relate but for my ""big kid"" (2 1/2 years old) this wee-lly wee-lly stunk!"
5,Who ever thought learning to use the potty could be so fun!,This is a terrific video for younger toddlers learning to use the potty. The story about Joshua and his potty is entertaining and shows kids just what to do. The potty song at the end is terrific with it's pictures of actual toddlers on their potties. We are still singing it at our house!
1,AWFUL,THIS VIDEO IS ACUTALLY ABOUT 5 MINUTES LONG. THE REST IS SHOWING KIDS DANCING AROUND POTTIES AND SITTING ON THEM WITH THEIR DIAPERS ON AND PUTTING THE POTTIES ON THEIR HEADS. I DONT RECOMMEND IT.
5,"an excellent tool, my son loved it!!","This movie left us all songing the potty song, especially my son, who wanted nothing to do with potty training until he saw it!! I highly recommend it."
5,I'm just Wilde about Oscar,"Stefan Rudnicki has done a wonderful job transforming Julian Mitchell's screenplay into a very satisfactory novel about the life of Oscar Wilde. The Samuelson produced movie was superb, and here the novel is able to add a different level of depth by interspersing quotes and pieces of poetry by Wilde throughout the story line.Granted, the story is not as complete as a full biography (Richard Ellman's is particularly thorough -- if somewhat dry) but it is told with such wit, humor and tragedy as to providing a most enchanting diversion. Highly Recommended, especially to those who are looking for good entertainment rather than mere scholarly facts and literary commentary."
5,Great Value,"These are very comfortable and sturdy gloves. They are a great deal that shouldn't be missed. If you are looking for light but lasting glove at a disposable glove price, then buy them. You will be glad you did. In fact, buy a few at a time as they can be used for all sorts of tasks, inside and out."
2,"Funny tape, but no nudity","Julie Strain and Lauren Hays (as a blonde) playing topless golf with two buffoon announcers (neither woman is nude). That's it. The set looks like it cost $20, the whole thing was filmed indoors, perhaps. I think Lauren Hays made this tape well before she was as famous as she is now, since you really cannot find her name associated with this video anywhere. The announcers are rather humorous, however."
4,Nice but a little light,The steak knives look just as pictures. They cut through pork chops easily. I love having some better steak knives. They are seemless which makes the look and feel good. My only comment is that they feel rather light as the handles are hollow. I'd prefer something with a little more balanced weight in my hand. My friend also noted that the weight was rather light.
3,Looks Tacky...,"I have to agree with the previous poster - why in the world is ""KitchenAid"" permanently stamped on the knife blade? It made me think I should stamp ""Mikasa"" in the center of my dinner plate.I had assumed that the ""KitchenAid"" logo was merely a peel off sticker. Once I saw it was stamped on to the blade I repackaged and returned it. Other than the stamp, the piece has an attractive shape and finish."
5,A Must for all Aspiring Novelis,I wish I had this book 20 years ago. It provides a checklist of ingredients required for a winning novel that would have saved me a lot of time and frustration.
3,Truncated travelogue,"The gimmick is the granddaughter of Churchill retraces his steps as a young soldier-adventurer-journalist when he fought and was captured in the long-forgotten Boer War in South Africa. The problem is there is so much more, even up to the point at which this documentary abruptly stops, well before World War I when Churchill hit his first peak. Perhaps, this is a series that will continue. But this film even leaves out his interesting times in India as a soldier in favor of his adventures in New York and Cuba when he became a weird hybrid of a soldier who also wrote newspaper dispatches for the folks back. You don't see that any more. Worth a peek, but you'll be left wanting."
2,chasing churchill,well photographed and boring no wonder they couldn't get funding for a follow up episode.
5,Excelente tributo a SOAD,World's Greatest Tribute to System of a DownLa verdad no sé cómo llegué a este disco pero llamó mi atención y lo compré para ver que tal se escuchaba y para variar un poco. Buen disco!
3,Good book for multicultural unit,"The illustrations in the book aren't fantastic, but they are clear and show the landscape of where each child lives. The text describes, using only a sentence or two for each page, how children around the world get to school. I think the brief text is great for the subject--since the book generates a lot of discussion, it takes awhile to get through. This is the type of book I would recommend in paperback for your classroom use; don't spend the extra money for a hardcover version. The kids enjoy hearing it but it's not something they'll ask for over and over. Oh- and the book has a back page with a map showing where each child is from. What a great addition for Kindergarten/First graders who are more familiar with the globe."
3,nice but not outstanding,My 5(almost 6) year old read it once and never picked it up again. To be fair it was competing with all the Christmas gifts. We have many books about different cultures but this one didn't seem to grab her. Probably better for the preschool set.
3,Decent product,"These are good blades. They do not hold up as well as the Milwaukee Axe or Torch blades, and are not as heavy-duty."
4,Wonderful Read!,"Very much along the lines of Janette Oake, Janet Baughman gives us a realistic story of one young woman's search for home and family which she finds in the arms and will of God through Jesus Christ. Mandy was a real-life character to whom I had no trouble relating. The story held my interest from beginning to end!"
2,Story goes no place fast,"The first few paragraphs after the prologue (a detailed description of the main characters nude body) put a pretty low expectation of this book in my mind. But it got a little better within the first few chapters. It seemed to set up an interesting premise with the discovery of the notebook page and a few murders. But sadly the plot went nowhere, and I mean nowhere. Aside some pointless although entertaining flashbacks of WWII everybody just sat around surfing the web finding stuff out (when they are not having sex). I did not know you could find these super deep dark secrets using google. The author also goes into very detailed descriptions of the surroundings that get old really fast. It is half of the book. The final showdown was a big mess, you don't really know what happens because everybody fumbles around in the dark. Lame lame, story skip it. This gets 2 stars because it was an easy fast read."
1,GREAT PREMISE BUT VERY DISAPPOINTING!,"This book looked like a winner-then I read it! The author indulges himself by going off on too many tangents with too many subplots and too many superfluous characters so that when the book comes to an end, you feel like you only got part of a story. The ending was boring, and didn't tie into anything. To me, this is a Dan Brown wannabe. Save your money."
2,I'm still not sure what the plot was,"I have a feeling Paul Christopher was as bored writing this book as I was reading it. He seemed to just end it with no real effort to wrap up any loose threads or explain why any of the events happened or what reason there was for the string of murders. But then, maybe that was par for the course since none of the characters seemed to have any real motive for anything they did, whether it was killing someone, having sex with someone, or anything else.All that being said, it was still better than Davinci Code."
1,HORRIBLE,Save your money and time by not reading this book. It is horribly written and is not enjoyable.
5,Great mystery thriller!,"This is definately the best book of the summer. Christopher delivers an impressive page-turner about a young art historian who stumbles across an original Michelangelo drawing, unwittingly making herself a target. If you like the Dan Brown books, don't miss this. Paul Christopher has a big future!"
4,Good Story,"I just finished reading this book, the second Paul Christopher book I've read in as many weeks, it was an interesting story filled with a lot of intrigue. I liked how he went from current day to the past and then tieing it all in together. The beginning talked about a young boy being whisked away from a convent and then really isn't talked about until near the end of the book and then not a lot of, this is what I found a wee bit disappointing. If you're just interested in a good story, fairly easy reading, then this is the book for you. I'm now looking for a few more of his books."
2,was there supposed to be a notebook somewhere?,"Aside from the fact that the main(?) character in the book finds a page from the ficticious? mystical? Michaelangelo's notebook, that's about all that's ever mentioned. You never see the page again and there is no notebook being sought. Very confusing plot . . . who was the guy in Florida that got killed in his pool and why . . . I did finish it but kept hoping it would get better, it didn't. Won't read this author again."
2,Forgettable And Disappointing,I'm going to keep this short.This book was a run of the mill Dan Brown wannabe and failed miserably.The plot was cliched and full of typical action sequences.The characters were poorly developed if developed at all.And worse of all what ever potential the plot had was never realized.I would avoid this book.
1,Good concepts poorly executed,This novel took two good plot lines that could have stood on their own and clumsily combined them into one novel and ruined both in doing so. Very disappointing. How could you possibly go wrong with Nazis and Michaelangelo? Paul Christopher found a way! Nice!
3,Yawn,"After reading works like ""Angels and Demons"", this book looked great to me. I was very disappointed. The author (Christopher Hyde, using a psuedonym) has an interesting concept, based on truth. However, the story does not work. The book seems to drag. The story's main character, Finn, a twenty-something college student stumbles upon a drawing at the museum where she is employed. She recognizes it as Michelangelo's work. Her boss denies this and abruptly fires her. This leads to an attack on her life and propels her all over New York trying to find out why this incident has put her in jeopardy.Again, a great premise, but a tedious book."
1,Very poorly done.,"Fortunately, this book was published in paperback, so I only wasted $8 on it. The plot is completely implausible with holes large enough to fly the shuttle through. There is no character development, the author's view toward women is sophomoric, and there are only about two pages of suspense at the end of the book. Take a pass on this one."
1,Duh,"I don't know how many times I've paused while reading this book to complain about how bad the writing is. While the plot seems interesting, the characters act and do things for completely no reason at all. I gave up reading when the main character had sex with the librarian guy for no reason at all...there was no romance leading up to it...nothing. I don't think I have the stomach to finish this book."
2,As imaginative as a high-school sophomore's lit project,"This book is so stilted in its plot and character development you want to find its author and demand a refund. The male lead, Valentine, is so carbon-copied off of other novelists who actually take the time to develop a semi-coherent character that you can almost see the plageurism. The female lead is worse, and you become very creeped out by the sex scenes. Don't waste your time, money, or effort."
4,"Decent summer novel, but no masterpiece","If you like Dan Brown's books, or Niel Stephenson, this is a decent book to wast an afternoon on, but its not a masterpiece. Interesting story background, but fairl boring characters. Way too many pop-culture references are going to date this book quickly, including a reference to ""how much this situation is like da Vinci' code"" - at least he admits his source material.Uninteresting twist thrown in on the last two pages, to tie the two plots together."
5,The Many Moods Of Romance,"Great variety of middle-of-the-road songs, many obscure from album cuts, nice romantic easy listening music; very relaxing, great for that relaxing, romantic mood. High recommend!"
3,NICE but not the great,This toy is cute however my son always moves in circles and gets stuck under the toy bar thing. it doesnt turn on when he kicks and moves even though it is supposed to. it also does not rock like it is supposed to. otherwise a cute toy but i dont think he is going to get much use out of it...
2,Wish I saved my $,"I bought this toy for my daughter before she was born, and she never really got that into it. It really seemed to eat batteries too. My daughter would roll herself off of the ""boat"" because she was so bored with it. She did like grabbing for the fish when she started to reach for things. I guess that's why I gave it a couple stars."
4,Would recommend,"My daughter is almost 4 months old, and she likes her Ocean Wonders Aquarium Gym more than I thought she would. She is now at the point where she reaches for the fish and every now and then she pulls them out of their little holder but they're so soft, she can't hurt herself when she does it. The music that plays is cute, too. The only thing that I wonder about is the title of the toy says ""Rockin' Aquarium Gym"", and unless I am missing something, her gym doesn't make any rocking motion whatsoever. But I would still recommend this toy. It holds my daughter's attention for a nice length of time, so it's definitely alright in my book.Toni Oliver"
4,Depends on mood,"This toy depends on my four month olds mood. Sometimes she will lay nicely and grab for the toys. But that leads to boredom after she bops herself a few times. When she is not in the mood, she rolls over and scoots off of it. This toys claims that it rocks because it is turned up at one end. To actually get it to rock you have to put a lot of effort into it and even then I wouldn't say too much for the feature. She does have fun with it sometimes, but she'd rather look and play with other things half the time."
5,My daughter's favorite toy!!,"I would DEFINITELY recommend this toy to anyone who's looking to buy a nice shower gift or just a gift in general! My daughter used this toy non-stop from 2-5 months of age. She had no problem making the aquarium come on by kicking it and she loved to try and grab the fish that hang overhead. Not only that, when she started teething, the fish have a soft but firm plastic and she constantly chewed on this. I have since bought one of these for all of my mom-to-be friends in hopes that their children love it as my daughter did! A++++"
4,Pretty Good Playmate,The one negative aspect of this toy is the fact that there's absolutely no padding for the baby to lay on. But to solve that problem I put one of my daughters quilt under the cover to make it soft and comfortable for her little body. I find the toys to be in her hands reach and the bright colors and sounds have helped her be more entertained with this toy
3,Not Thrilled with this at all,"We bought this item because we were so pleased with the Aquarium Bouncer Seat and the Crib Aquarium so we thought our little boy would love this as well. Well, the first problem we found was with the screws. For some reason we can not get them to screw in as tightly as they need to be and two of them have actually fallen out a couple of times (not when my baby was playing with it fortunately) Also, our baby only seemed to care for this toy for a very short period of time. I think he decided he liked it at about 3 months and by the time he turned 4 months he would watch the fish for all of 5 mins before crying out of boredom. Last week I went back to Babies R Us and purchased the Fisher Price Musical Play Garden and that has worked out wonderfully. It is a much safer toy and our son gets so much more enjoyment out of it. Word of warning...don't buy this just because you have the rest of the Aquarium line..you will be disppointed!"
1,toy a danger,"My lil 3 mth old was hurt after he kicked the swimming fish, he kicked off the toy and was crying as 1/2 his body was off the hard plastic frame. I thought it was cute because of the swimming fish, but not a good toy for a baby or infant. We're sending back to fisherprice. I think this toy will be recalled soon. I'm disappointed since now my baby is 3 mths and I could have bought a better toy."
2,Cute but not well made,"This is a very cute toy and my son enjoys batting at the rattles, but, like others have mentioned, the wheel gets stuck often and makes a horrible clicking noise (mine hasn't stopped working altogether yet) and when it is turning the engine makes a rather large churning noise. I expected better quality from Fisher Price."
2,Don't buy this!,"I bought this item because I couldn't find the leap frog leapstart playmat. This thing is junk! First of all, it's not very soft for a little baby to be playing on. Under the thin piece of frabic is hard plastic. The fabric doesn't even cover all of the plastic. Second, once your baby starts moving around a little, there is no place for him/her to move. The thing is just not big enough. Another thing is the yellow coverings on the sides do not screw on all the way. You can only turn the screws in a little before they are too tight to turn anymore. The picture even shows the yellow covering on the left side falling apart. When I realized this, that's when I started to take it apart. I will return it for something else."
4,Worth half the price...,"I had seen this gym and was interested in purchasing it for my second son, but I never would have paid full price for it. I got it at Toys 'R' Us on their discount table (where other people's opened returns end up). I paid $19 and would not have bought it for a penny more. It's fun for my son (now 8 months) for about a 1/2 hour, which is pretty standard. As for the knocking noise the wheel tends to make when he's ""driving"" the boat--it's obvious to me that it was designed in such a way that it wouldn't break when kids pulled on it while it makes its rotation, but it would be nice if the clicking weren't so loud. And it is pretty bulky. It's nice when toys can be folded away easily. So, if you have the space and the money to burn--go for it."
1,not comfortable,If I would have been able to try this out before buying it I would have never bought it. The surface is way to hard for a baby to be laying on it. The it is not too sensitive to movement so when baby kicks or moves it doesnt always turn itself on. I would have much rather bought a playmat instead.
1,Not really worth it,This was bought for my son for a babyshower gift. He really doesn't play with it. It doesn't do much. I also had a hard time opening the part where you put in the batteries. I was not happy with it.
4,loved it once.....,My 3 month old baby loved the gym.Still does but now he is 5 months and pulled down the fish and the tube part ended up around his neck! The company wants us to send it back.This gym is not safe pleae do not buy this.
4,great toy,"I bought this toy for my son when he was 2 months old, he has always loved it and has really grown with it. He started out just lying there watching it and listening to the music, then became interested in all the toys, then learned to pull the toys out to suck on and shake, and now at 6 months he sits up to ""drive"" the boat. It's wonderful!!! I do wish it could fold flat for storage, but when you lower the whell it can fit under the crib or be leaning up against a wall - it's so worth it"
3,Mom likes it...son doesn't,"I received this toy from my registry. My now 4-month-old son really doesn't care for this toy. We put him on his back (he doesn't sit up yet), and he gets antsy and frustrated quickly. I'm hoping that when he's able to sit up, he can learn to enjoy the gym because right now I seem to be the only one intrigued by it."
1,save your money,"i received this for my baby shower. thought it was neat and fun and would grow with my daughter. boy was i fooled as many others have said as soon as my daughter could move she would turn and get stuck between the toy bar, it never activated it self by rocking the boat, and when she was able to sit up it was pointless b/c the yellow thing ,that turns and has fish in it, as soon as she touched it would make this loud knocking noise like she was breaking it. it would do that noise too when she was lying on her back and smaller b/c she would put her feet on it. i just don't think its worth buying you can at most only use it for 2 months until they can sart moving a little"
3,Great entertainer until my daughter learned to sit....,"I loved this when we first bought it. My daughter was soo thrilled watching the lights and the fish go round and pulling on the toys that hang from it... However, as she got to be about 5-6 months she was learning to sit. I adjusted it to the sitting position... and she was doing fine until she started to grab the wheel part and pull herself right over it. I don't let her play with it unless i'm staying right with her now so she doesn't end up diving face first to the floor. I think it oculd have been made a little better for sitting. But it was a GREAT toy for the first 4-5 months! I think we got our moneys worth."
2,Safety concerns,"I have to admit that my daughter enjoys this toy, but I am scared when she plays with it. She is 5 months old and she loves to grab things. There are 2 fish toys and 2 rattles and they are made to come out of the toy. She grabs them and pulls them. They have hit her in the head and left red marks, which as a parent I hate seeing any ""boo-boo."" The part that hits her is made of bendable rubber to go into the toy. I just have major concerns about safety. Why didn't they attach these toys more securely?"
3,Just Okay,"I love most of the Ocean Wonders products, so I was excited to buy this gym for my son. I am disappointed in it though. My son quickly becomes bored with it. The music and lights are entertaining for a few minutes. There aren't enough toys included with this gym."
3,Okay Toy,"I bought this toy because it looked like it would be alot of fun for my daughter. She loves things that play music. It looked perfect. When I got it home and put it together it was making this horrible clicking noise. I didn't have my receipt anymore so I called Fisher Price. They were more than willing to replace it for me. They even paid for the shipping for me to send it back to them. Until today I didn't even go in and read any of the reviews on it and I see that quite a few people had the same problem. I now have the new one and my daughter does enjoy playing with it. I don't have a problem with the material mat on mine. My daughter is still small so she doesn't roll off of it or anything. She loves the rattle noises in the fish when she shakes them. I wouldn't not recommend this, but if you buy it and it's not working properly call Fisher Price and they will replace it for free."
2,Not made well,"I took this product back because the fabric doesn't fit the base of the toy as well as the base is very hard and uncomfortable for a baby; especially an infant.The other thing that I did not like about it, is the fact it doesn't fold up to make it easy to store. You have this huge piece of plastic always on your den floor."
1,This toy is a WASTE OF MONEY & Space!,We got this as a gift! It is so worthless! I wish the store would take it back! The kids did not like it and it really doesn't do anything fun. Don't waste your money!
2,Doesn't Do Much,"I brought this for my daughter today (she is 7 months old) and after I put it together and saw her playing with it I am returning it tomorrow. For a start it doesn't do much, the steering wheel just turns around and the fish move and the clicking noise that the wheel makes drives me crazy. I am trying the Little Tikes similiar product. It looks better and it is half the price. I was looking for a toy that she could sit in front of and play with, this is not it."
2,LOUSY TOY,"THE REASON I DON'T RECOMEND THIS TOY IS FOR THE SIMPLE FACT THAT I HAD TO KICK THE TOY MYSELF FOR IT TO KEEP GOING, EVEN THOUGH ITS SUPPOSE TO MOVE WITH THE BABIES MOTION. OTHER THAN THAT IT DOES WORK IF YOU WANT TO USE IT FOR YOUR BABY'S DEVELOPMENTAL SKILLS. BUT I WOULD NOT WASTE MY MONEY I RETURNED IT THE SAME NIGHT"
3,choking hazard,the choking hazard warning is just for when you are putting it together! Adult assembly required because the parts are small!
2,Don't expect a lot of fun with this one,"This toy isn't worth the price. I thought it would be great for many stages of my baby's life, but it's really not fun, the music is annoying and the lights don't catch my baby's attention. Go with another type of activity mat because this one isn't worth having."
3,"great for 2-5 month olds, but not older","My 6 month old sticks his feet up on the wheel from a lying down position, and stops the wheel from moving. It no longer turns or plays music. The same thing could easily happen from the sitting postition as well. He loved it for the first few months though."
3,"Love the idea, but doesn't work well...","My daughter, 4 months, loves to look at the fish and watch the lights and movements, but there is a downfall to this toy. You have to really rock this toy to make it work. It is not sensitive enough for my daughter to activate it on her own. We bought this gym thinking that her movements would activate it easily and she would learn that her legs moving would make it work, but to our dismay, the gym does not do this. I was disappointed after learning this. She still likes to lay on it and watch the movement.Other than this complaint, we like the music, the colors and the idea that she will be able to play with it when she is older."
3,Cross Country Fleece with Wind Block Panels,The Style of the jacket is nice but it is not as warm as I thought it would be. Also I wish the pockets were lined on both sides with fleece. The pockets do not keep your hands warm
3,well-suited as a secondary fleece undercoat type,"Well made for the price. warm and solid build. yet not as a primary wear for your looks; i.e. not made w/ the shape and cut that would make one looks good and fashioned.Yet, used as a winter undercoat or support under another better looking jacket, it will fit your bill in a grand manner."
4,good quality,"This jacket is very warm and elegantly made. The only thing fleeting about this item is its color which appears not to be as dark and orange I was hoping for. Other than that, it's a very fashionable and quality jacket---worth every dime"
2,Product looks different from the one online.,was very disappointed with the quality. What was shipped the me was way different from what I received.I tried to contact buyer but didn't respond to my e-mail. I don't think I will ever recommend anybody to by from this buyer.
1,"A waste of postage, time and money...bigtime",If this were the first book I'd read as an adult I'd have stopped reading 30 years ago.
4,Vanagon Spectra fuel tank,"This tank from ""spectra"" was suppose to be made in the USA or Canada. Nosign of who make it, but it seams to have worked OK. IT is NOT galvanized as someare advertising. The paint was very thin, so I added an other coat of paint.Price was fair. Clearly not factory quality. OTher vendors have same tank fora lot more. Not much else to choice from unless you want to spend twice as much."
3,Hate to disagree but...,"I loved ""Fat Sick and Nearly Dead"" and saw an add for this movie on the JointheReboot website. I was expecting something more like that. I don't disagree with the ideas discussed here, I just didn't like the format. A lot of the clips were repetitive, there were only minor allusions to some of the speakers' personal stories - which sounded like they would have been some of the most compelling parts. I also didn't find the little vignettes of the diet-soda chugging lady necessary, it was a cheesy and distracting story telling device. I wanted to see more personal stories and more specifics on healthy eating and juicing and whatnot. Disappointed."
3,Just ok,"I was hoping for something deeper, just skipping a stone saying the same things over and over.....sorry I bought it at $8.99"
5,I'm Hungry for Change,Will seriously make you rethink what you eat and the diets you go on. Unlike most food documentaries instead of showing just what's bad and who's to blame it shows what to eat in it's place. Very Informative.
2,not informative enough,"for me, it was too new agey for me.I already knew alot of the information you did give.It might be a good presentation for someone who is just beginning to learn and desiring to change their lifestyle."
3,Good but...,The first 50 minutes tell you what you shouldn't be eating. Very little is said about what you should be eating specifically.
5,Fresh!,Same info. New way. Female character was my favorite. Saw myself in her bad habits and can see myself changing just as she did :)
2,not so great,"kinda lame. hated the format he used. a screenplay about writing a screenplay. novel, but pretty silly and not very informative."
3,no title,"I found that the book was over priced at $40, when I found another one in a gift shop at $20 -"
3,What can you expect?,"""Cith is Dealán"" was bu Niall Ó Donaill called the funniest collection of short stories by Séamus Ó Grianna. I am not very sure. In my opinion, it is not better or worse than the average, and as usually, it is the language that counts: it is great Irish for the learner, but no very original literature. Actually, I did like Cora Cinniúna better, because, in the midst of all those mediocrities, there were some strong stories. In Cith is Dealán, there might be one or two which have lasting literary value other than that of the beautiful Irish."
5,Bass 305 at its best,"The Album title pretty much says it all, a bunch of great mixes of classic 305 will be shaking the whole house down once you unleash this awesome music. A good variety of tonal bass hitting up every good frequency range. If you enjoy some good bass music then this is a must buy."
3,It does its job.,"I should have bought this a long time ago, I got the product hooked it and began to program my remote starter. It does what it is design for, the only thing I can see that they could improve on the product is to make the Display a bit brighter."
2,99.9% of the time not needed,this is not needed 99% of the time only a select few ajustments need this piece. buy this if you need a 59 second alarm siren or program 60 seconds without it. 60 seconds is fine for me. trust me before you can get this out of your toolbox and unwind the cords i will be done programming mine the usual method and still have time to laugh at you while im cracking a ice cold beer
4,Decent Film,"Nice Family drama. Good story and around movie. I need something to watch one morning, and this caught my eye. Not perfect but entertaining."
5,Good Story for Everyone,Dynamite story that everyone can watch. There is plenty to think about. What would it be like to grow up in those circumstances? All the actors are excellent -- several are local to the area.
3,Simply Okay,The movie was simply okay. I found it to be slow and thought the lead actor could have taken some acting lessons.
3,AN OKAY MOVIE!,This movie is mixed with a lot of stuff. It even has a Barney Fife type cop in the movie. John Goodman does an excellent job in the movie. I thought this movie was an okay movie because there were some clips in the movie that was too good to be true. Like when all the boys escape from their cells and only one cop was on duty and he was asleep. Does it have a message? Well I felt the message was a little confusing. I mean in the start of the movie the kid is digging a grave for his father. It has its moments in the movie. There's sad scenes and funny scenes. All in all if you want ot see a so so film then this one is for you. I don't know how it can be a family film because there's so much death in the movie to deal with. At least for a minor (12 and under) to deal with.
5,Awesome Movie=),"I waited and waited for this excellent movie to become available on Netflix, then finally ordered a copy from Amazon. Well, I just LOVED the movie=) Jimmy Bennett was outstanding as usual, and the movie is now a definite favorite of mine. Give it a gander; you will not regret it=)"
2,Please a weak piece,"Buy their greatest hits or their first three albums pretty much. Dont bother with these B-Sides, which can be good if properlly chosen, mixed and such but man some gay songs on here, gay versions of good songs, good songs ive heard many times before on their first 3 albums and thats pretty much it. Not very worthy of my cd collection besides the Coal Chamber name on it and cool cover. Most certainly not a good showcase of CC's talent or their awsome music. Dont buy it and dont dare buy it as their first album u may be turned off completely."
1,I had a dream.,"I dream of a day when our children are safe in the streets. I dream of a day when minimum wage workers are paid more than $6.75 an hour. I dream of a day when talented musicians are paid their dues. I dream of a day, a glorious day when all the band members of Coal Chamber are ran over by trucks. But this is a sick world, isn't it? I dream of a day. I dream. I dream away."
1,"""C"" is for Coal Chamber","It is so cool how Cookie Monster has a band. I always thought he would just stick to Sesame Street, but he is a really good singer! He writes really good lyrics too...Big Truck is just a masterpiece. He is just a regular poet. I thought the lyrics to Loco were just wonderfully written too."
2,I took it back,"I had high hopes for this game, but it was not what I had hoped. As with one other reviewer, I was hoping for something more along the lines of the original duck hunting game featuring clays etc. I like the fact that is teaches good hunting etiquette in that you need to train your dog before you go hunging etc, but it was low on action. If you want a slow paced and patience teaching game, this is pretty good. If you want action, keep looking, that's what I am doing now."
1,this is the worst game I own for the wii,"I rarely write product reviews but I thought this game would be like the original duck hunt which was a great game. It is not. This game is PAINFULLY TERRIBLE. You ""train"" your dog which is the most arduous and menial task I've ever had to do in a game. I will say that after you go through all of the crap and finally figure out how to shoot a duck, it is very satisfying. I attribute this to the fact that every other aspect of this game is horrible and that the hour or so you spent on training and trying to shoot and retrieve a duck is lost forever from your life, so that one duck means a lot. Please don't buy this game."
3,great for short term trips,"i purchased this bag for a Sony DV camcorder. it's well padded sides and top gave great protection to the camera, and the dual zipper top is excellent for easily taking out and putting the camera back in. the only draw back is the space. the camera fits snuggly into the main compartment, but other than that, the only other things i could fit in the bag were one set of wires, and 2 extra tapes. so for short term trips, it's great, but for trips where you'll need to bring along a charger, extra batteries, etc., it won't do you much good."
2,A cookbook for Angel Investors,"My recent experience with angel investors is that they come in all flavors - from the sophisticated networks of dedicated portfolio managers to the impetuously interested or personal friend. Winning Angels provides a framework on which we can understand risk avoidance strategies, but doesn't go far enough to help most understand the characteristics of great opportunities or more importantly, the appropriate behavior of effective angel investors. I'm hoping there is a next book that enables true angel investors (not just family and friends) to participate as investors should. Angels are a critical part of the start-up ecosystem. Anything that can help make this process more efficient will certainly be welcome. Winning Angels falls short."
2,High Quality Content; Low Quality Print Reproduction,"I am a professor teaching in a master of entrepreneurship program. This is a great book, but the reproduction quality is very much sub-par. I have several review copies and they are all the same poor quality, so I assume that is the case with all copies that exist. For example, have a look at the photo of Rob Robinson on page 240. Nearly black, no contrast. Maybe photos aren't that important, but graphics are ... look at Figure 44.1 on page 256. The callouts in the graphic are hardly legible (too dark against a dark background). For a $50 book, this is unacceptable. Looks like a cheap POD (print-on-demand) production. Five stars on quality of content. One star on quality of reproduction."
1,Complaint,"We note that the print of this book looks more like a photocopy. As we paid USD44.99 for each book, we would expect better quality. Kindly look into this matter. Otherwise we wish to seek a refund. Thank you."
2,Disappointing,"After the hype on the cover, I was expecting something more practical and informative ~ I was disappointed. At best it was patronizing, at worst banal. Apparently written for the gullible amateur, I was expected to feel educated with comments such as ""once you've found a winner ~ stick with them"" or ""build reciprocal realtionships with VCs to develop deal flow"". How many VCs are there in Boise, Idaho and do they wear funny hats for identifcation?"
4,great value,great price for what you get. not too durable but it comes with a ton of tools! My son loves it.
4,busy for hours,I got 2 sets of these toy tools for my 2& 3 year old boys. They both enjoy all the pieces very much. It's great for motor skills. I just need to keep a close eye on the boys if they are playing with the tools near the TV. I caught my youngest trying to hammer the screen.We have had these for a couple of weeks now & have 2 broken pieces (the tape measure & hammer). These toys keep my boys quite busy.
1,Handle bent and warranty worth very little...,"Second trip with this bag and it is already rendered useless... I'm not even hard on these things. The interior did fine minus the zipper on the inside which broke immediately but it's the handle that I am really upset with. I'm not sure what time of metal or plastic that is but it's pathetic. A 28"" bag holding about 50lbs you would think that the handle would be a higher grade than this! Anyway, fixing this doesn't even seem worth it to me, I think I'll quit looking for a good deal and find some more durable pieces of luggage. I guess since I'm rating luggage here I might as well throw out a couple that have been very successful for me; they're both Eddie Bauer. Shame on you SwissGear for putting out such low-grade luggage!"
3,Decent Bag,This bag hold point and shoot cameras pretty well. My olympus camera fits pretty well. No thing too fancy.
1,No luck with this one,"Politically motivated movies are fine, but they can be done more subtle. I don't think this movie is any good in that sense. The Serbian director is trying to present Serbian Army as being attacked, but we all know what happened in Bosnian conflict. Good luck next time."
1,what a joke,"Wow, you have some anger issues going on with Bosnians and Croatians. Of course you don't want to admit that the Serbs were the bad guys. That is human nature. And if you feel comfortable living in your own little world of dreams, then go ahead. The rest of the world knows what went on. Sweet dreams amigo."
1,Pretty Disappointing,"Pretty Village, Pretty Flame was pretty disappointing for me. As a humanitarian worker living the past four years in former Yugoslavia, I was prepared for the outrage and shock essential to a true-life war drama. But I was also hoping for some ennobling message, or a possible glimpse of heroism, beauty, or human kindness. What I found instead was a fragmented and dehumanizing film that left me disgusted with just about everyone around me. The film is unquestionably realistic, but beyond presenting an accurate picture of life, I still expect art to elevate. If I want to see this kind of profanity, I'd do better to save my money and take a walk down the street."
1,Poor and dishonest,"The movie represents another Serbian propaganda attempt to make the war in Bosnia look like a civil war with equally responsible sides. It tries to hide Serbian atrocities against Bosnian civilians, committed during the Serbian aggression on Bosnia. Bosnians had no weapons to defend themselves against the savagery. The situation in which Serbian forces are hiding in tunnel is even more absurd knowing that Bosnian did not even have weapons. The propaganda attempt falls short of its purpose and comes across more as a farce. Fortunately, history tells us what really happened in Bosnia."
5,One of the best war movies ever made.,"I rented Pretty Village Pretty Flame on an impulse one night because I'm interested in the Boznian situation. I wasn't sure what to expect, though in all honesty, I wasn't sure if it's be any good. I was blown out of the water. It's brutally honest, cynical and yet darkly humorous account of the war in Yugoslavia amazed me. The story, the performances and most of all the directorship were all grade A+. I must say that Dragojevic' has made a powerful, haunting film that is even, if one can call a war movie such, fun for the eyes with it's impressive visuals. I recently purchased this title on DVD and hit a snag. The DVD transfer leaves the film a bit grainy in parts with pixilation present from time to time. Still, a terrific movie that I believe anyone who likes ""real"" movies should buy."
2,Most disappointing DVD transfer,"What a shame this DVD transfer is so aweful, because the movie is great. I have seen this movie before on SBS TV (Australia) and have been wanting a copy since. But this DVD looks like a transfer from an already poor quality VHS copy. Very disappointed."
2,could have been better written,"Could have been better written, better acted, better photographed. Way too many flashbacks.This whole thing is kind of a mess, really. Lacks cohesiveness.Premise is interesting enough and a truly gifted director might have made a great film out of it.The guy who directed this is no Akira Kurosawa, that's for sure."
3,Cool but tricky...,"Yeah, the film is cool. Points out some really true facts of the war in general. Shows how cruel it can be, and as someone mentioned that no one gets out of the war same as he was before. However, I say tricky because if the film was placed in the non-specific place/time (imaginary country at end of this century) I would agree that this film is really good. Unfortunately, the film explains very characteristic and very real war. It simplifies the relations between the warring parts, simplifies the reasons and makes every participating side in the war equal. Which is not the truth. I know, I was there. That's why I feel small part of propaganda behind this movie, which may not collide with the main message of the film (cruelty, nonsense of the war in general), but will give wrong, subjective impression on the particular war to non-balkans audience..."
1,do not buy this,"this came in a 3 ring binder format, encased in plastic, without a back cover, and a cardboard backing. i stress, do NOT buy this"
4,Interpersonal Communications Book,"Very fast shipping. But a little highlighting, which is alright with me! Helped out a little bit for the first test!"
4,This story jumps back and forth in time BUT THERE IS A BONUS,The bonus is - you get to see Markéta Irglová completely naked. I am not complaining about that! The story starts out with the end result of Glen and Markéta breaking up. I got the feeling that Glen Hansard has a broken heart but Markéta moved on. I wonder how many songs on Glen's solo album are based about her. The story then goes back to the beginning which is just after they won the Academy Award. I think it is worth watching if nothing else than to see the relationship between Glen and his parents. Since this was filmed Glen's father passed away.
4,The Swell Season Documentary 2011,"The Swell Season is a beautiful documentary about musicians Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova and their rise to fame and the rise and fall of their love. Rather than a film which departs from the hollow rawness of their music, The Swell Season is a raw and understated portrayal of the story and life behind their songs."
5,Perfectly gapped spark plug for my TroyBuilt Mower - Honda Engine,"I needed to replace the spark plug on my TroyBuilt push lawn mower (with a Honda Engine) and I wanted one that was gapped properly. This was it. Perfect replacement and the mower is starting faster and like a charm. I was doing a tune-up on it after really noticing decline in starting.The spark plug change rectified the problem and this one was perfect. Not a generic spark plug that needs gapping, but one that is set to go right out of the package.That's what I wanted, that is what I got. Perfect fit."
3,NICE ENCOURAGING READ!!,"VERSES ARE QUOTED AND THE ""E-MAILS"" ARE PUT INTO MODERN WORDS BASED ON THE QUOTE IN RESPONSE SO TO SPEAK. THEY ARE LIKE SMALL LETTERS TO THE READER ON EACH PAGE ON A VARIETY OF TOPIC STRUGGLES. I WANT TO ORDER THE ONE FOR WOMEN AND MEN AND KIDS AND GRADS? THAT LAST ONE SOUNDS A BIT NARCISSISTIC BUT I'M CURIOUS AS TO HOW THE BIBLE IS USED AS REFERENCE ENCOURAGEMENT FOR GRADS LOL"
5,smells wonderful,ordered this perfume when i had no idea what to order and i wasn't sure what it would smell like. loved it...and hubby says he likes it too! :)thank you
3,Small,"This butterfly chair cover is small. It sat very high, and did not give way for any lounging in my standard frame. It is also narrow.The seams seemed to be made of vinyl, and were just sewn over top of the two pieces of fabric which made the chair, I'm assuming. And it was a bit stiff.It was 'ok'.I unfortunately returned this item to the seller, and although they were courteous, I was charged a restocking fee on top of paying for my own shipping."
3,Not as thick as my previous cover,"This cover is fine, but the canvas is not as thick as the original cover I had on the chair. Also, the edge binding is cheaper looking than the cover fabric. I will be keeping these covers, but will look for a different cover when I need new ones again."
2,Tastes awful!,"To be sure, this product is loaded with Vitamins and Minerals and can easily replace multiple separate supplements. However, the powder will turn your drink green and tastes like you are drinking liquified Kale. I enjoy my morning protein smoothie too much to make this concession. I ordered the Allone Multiple Vitamins & Minerals - Fruit Antioxidant (also available on Amazon), which also contains phyto-chemicals but is fruit-based and much more pleasant tasting."
3,Not her best,I was less impressed with this book than I have been with her other works. The story was entertaining but not engaging nor memorable as I'd hoped. The characters lacked depth and it was difficult to emotionally identify with any of them.
5,Sketchers Lights,My son loves his Sketchers lights. They are a smart looking sandal and the lights are great. We went to a firework display and everyone was impressed at how bright the lights were on his sandals. I am very happy with the design and this hard wearing sandal. I will definitly stay with Sketchers brand.
4,Great,What a relaxing start to your day with th sounds of this CD and then your off into jazz with the greats.You cannot just stumble upon albums this good without doing some research.this is worth a buy if you are looking for light simple and fun jazz
3,It's okay...different,"I was really excited to get this book, after reading all the reviews, I was ready for a breath of fresh air in my scrapbooking. However, I have to say, I'm disappointed. I am married with kids, and I like to try to keep my scrapbooking modern and ""real"", rather than leaning towards the traditional. However, there were only a few pages that I felt I could take away some useful ideas from, the rest just seemed like portraits from a coffee table book. I appreciate the author's effort to offer up some contemporary ideas on scrapbooking, from people from all walks of life, but I just found the book to be okay. I agree with the other reviewer who said that it might be more helpful to have some further layout how-tos, but I don't know. This book just didn't speak to me like some others out there."
4,"Fun, Inspiring, A Needed Change","This book is really fun and funny to read, and opens creative doors in your mind. IT's time for a scrap booking book that isn't about ""beautiful people"" living in perfect suburbs! I like the different lay out and art ideas. My critique is that I wished for better ""how-to's"". This is a compilation of pages and suggestions from the scrappers who made the pages, and their stories are interesting. The pages are not shown step by step, like in other scrap book books, and some additional guidance of achieving the art effects would have been good. Overall, an inspiration to make scrapbooks that are about more than my own face or my kid's first tooth ;-)"
5,Cheap and good,"Seriously, this thing could be a lot crappier and still be worth the price. It's thick enough that you don't feel like it's going to snap any second like some pewter items, and it actually looks pretty good. What more do you want? Buy it."
5,A great gift!,I love this watch. I wear it mostly everyday. Its a good watch dainty and professional at the same time.
1,Unbeleviable Seiko Water Resistant Problem,"I purchased Seiko Women's Coutura Watch #SXD569 in 02/02/2007, but I have a problem with the watch, due to water leakage, eventhough it is water resistent up to 100m."
2,comfy but not cute,"This product. Is very comfortable but makes you look like your wearing a grandma slipper.( No offense to the grandmothers of the world). This shoe has a good length. If you have longer feet it will be a good pick. However, the shoes is fairly wide and the strap does not do very much to keep your foot securely in the shoe. The leather is a fine quality. The price and the style just do not measure up."
5,Ahh! All Day Comfort,These are very comfortable shoes. My feet felt so good wearing them from the very beginning to the very end of my busy day. The shoes are well made and stylish. Highly recommended.
1,The Most MADAM,"Ok, be nazare man Googoosh sambole BiHayaei dar bayn tamaam-e khanandehay-e Irani ast.Man pishnahaad mikonam bere va filmhay-e cinamaiyash ra az tooye khyabaanha jam kond. KHAK bar sar-e Masood Kimiiaei ke hanooz zanesh dar bimarestan mariz bood va namorde bood raft va Googoosh ro baraay-e khalvat-e shabhaaye khodesh entekhab kard."
2,Adequate. Not built to last.,"I bought one of these for my s-10 digital camera, and proceeded to wear it around, somewhat extensively, after 6 or 7 months of owning it though, the stitching along the zipper came totally out, rendering it somewhat useless. I replaced it with a somewhat less fashionable, but more durable Samsonite camera bag.Also the zippered opening of this bag is prone to slightly scratch or mar plastic, or antireflective coatings such as those on camera LCDs."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"This is another in the excellent series of compilations that Marvel Comics produced in the middle of the 1970s. They changed the focus with this volume, and decided to highlight some of their bombastic, bigger than life supervillains.Of course, you get the heroes tagging along in the conflict, but you can't go wrong with Doctor Doom and Dormammu for example, and how they came to be."
2,Definitely not upto par.,"Well yes, it has some very first appearances of classic marvel villains but the artwork is obviously not worth the money. Only two or three story are visually appealing and entertaining. The cost DEFINITELY does not justify the returns."
2,could have been better,"This has the origins of villains Dr. Doom (vs Fantastic Four), Loki (vs. Thor), Red Skull (vs Captain America), Green Goblin (vs Spiderman) and Abomination (vs Hulk) and first appearances of Dormammu (vs Dr. Strange) and Mephisto (vs Silver Surfer).The Good: You get to see Dr. Doom without his mask on!The Bad: The artwork and story telling is of average quality. Since the stories are from the old issues, the artwork appears very clunky. The Loki tale is poorly done."
5,Another Beautiful Score!,"Another beautiful score from resident 20th Century Fox composer and arranger, Alfred Newman. It's a moving musical testament to the life of Peter Marshall who would someday be Pastor to Presidents and Congress, but also a moving testament to his wife, Katherine. Beautiful and sentimental with Celtic themes interwoven, I love this score!"
2,Disappointing CD!,"I love Loretta Lynn, but found this CD to be very disappointing. It didn't contain the original recordings, and some of the songs were just plain silly (""Hey Loretta"", ""Let Your Love Flow"", ""Me And Bobby McGee""). I wish someone had warned me before I spent my money on this CD."
4,Nice Product,"It really works! Just after two use, I can tell my teeth are much brighter, shining white!"
1,Old stuff and bad Grammar,Most of the writing is old stuff that has been bandied about for years by just about everyone. Some is very crude and has no place in a book such as this. The Grammar is bad and there are frequent misspellings. Not worth purchasing.
3,"Very well put together, one person album","This album, is very well put together, for a one person made and produced album, with self written songs, with good lyrics, a lot of the songs...seem to be rather ""lonely"", such as ""Blowin Kisses at the moon"", and When it all comes down to Lonely"" Jerry's album is Best described as Country, or folk country, but yet in ""Morning Sun"", there is a trace of rock with the impressive drum track. all in all, I would say this is a very well done album, by a very talented artist...Rock on Jerry"
2,One man produced album. Good lyrics guitar and drums,"Jerry seems to busy,maybe kick back a little bi"
3,Interesting speculative physics or metaphysics,"Having read the book carefully, I can say that it speaks of some interesting characteristics of the mind reflected in the Vedic hymns that mirror the world of physics. I believe this is what Subhash Kak also seems to say in his foreword to the book. In other words, this book is not about physics but rather it represents the connections between the physical world and the structure of the mind. One might call this subject speculative physics or metaphysics. It is not the clearest exposition of such metaphysics, and this made me struggle to decide whether to give the book two stars or three stars. I chose the latter number for its sheer originality."
3,good book,For readers who do have knowledge of modern science will be able to understand this book. As it just details vedic science and relates it with modern science.
1,Where is the science?,I was looking forward to some ineresting science from the vedas. What this book provided was disappointing conjecture. A waste of time.
4,Finally!,"Author should also read Swami Yukteswar's ""Holy Science,"" published by Self-Realization Fellowship. It confirms many of the concepts in your book. Yukteswar was a yogi of high realization, notably featured in an Evan Wentz book and Yogananda's Autobiography of a Yogi.Excellent book and thanks!"
5,A major breakthrough towards the investigation of Vedas,"Raja Roy has focussed the richness of ancient Hindu culture in the field of science.I had no opportunity to learn Sanskrit to enable me to read Vedas, but in my opinion Raja Roy has helped me to understand the core of Hindu science and the real meaning of Hinduism. It is so interesting to find out that many problems of cosmology can be solved in the framework of Vedas."
5,Candle Magic For Beginners,Great book for the beginner. This book has lots of useful information in an easy to understand format.
5,A Great Book for Kids and Adult Cat Lovers!,"I'm a first grade teacher who discovered this book in our library today and knew instantly it would make the perfect gift for my cat-loving friend who teaches preschool! It's fun to read books to kids and also be able to get a kick out of it yourself. The vocabulary helps stretch the kids a little too. Mine asked, ""What's pate?! """
1,Incorrect quantity,"Incorrect quantity,originally I buy two sets,but only to the piece,third pieces, was later a set, but also sent another set of 1-2."
4,A dark story,"This is an easy read but filled with lots of twists and turns. Jim Thompson lives up to his reputation as the successor to Dashiell Hammett. I recommend the story to all who enjoy a story with gritty characters and matching dialogue. Then watch the movie, starring John Cusack, Anjelica Huston and Annette Benning, for a faithful visualization of this excellent book."
2,"My first Thompson, disappointing, but I'll try another","This being my first Jim Thompson novel, I expected brilliance. I had heard from many readers whose opinions I highly respect, that Thompson novels were apexes of noir literature. Maybe. But The Grifters certainly isn't. It has the tasty cheesiness of a mid-century crime noir, but lacks any characterization that make a story compelling.I closed the novel recalling this about the plot: criminal meets woman. Criminal's mother doesn't like woman. One woman kills the other. Queue twist, and scene. This isn't something worth praising.I'll definitely try another Thompson novel, as I respect close friends who adore his work, but the next one had better be great."
3,"Good Dialogue, But Still a Bit Dry","I expected this book to be a breeze, because noir often moves quickly, and there were about one-hundred-and-twenty pages of reading, but I had to force myself to sit through it, especially when I realized that the pages were running out and a climax was nowhere in sight.While the dialogue between the characters was hilarious, the rest of the book was a little tepid. The build-up never actually led anywhere, and some characters, it seemed, had no purpose whatsoever than to fill a few pages.I think that with better plot construction, The Grifters would've been a real gem. As is, however, it's not at all brilliant (and not wholly bad, either). If you want to be mildly amused for an hour, pick it up."
3,Dated,"Book is definitely dated, refering to moments that todays technology would leave moot.... its ok but I regret having bought it."
5,Gut wrenching.,"Be forewarned. This novel is not for the faint of heart. If you are easily offended, do not read The Grifters. In this classic example of pulp fiction, Jim Thompson takes us on a cruel and hideous journey through a few weeks in the life of Roy Dillon, a practitioner of the short con working in Los Angeles. Thompson's writing is raw and unflinching. No holds are barred, no topic is taboo. He has created a fascinating portrayal of society's criminal netherworld in a way that is thoroughly engaging even as it dares you not to avert your eyes. Reading The Grifters is a powerful, visceral experience that stays with you."
2,Overrated,This cd is completely overrated but should be bought if it can be had for a cheap price (like a used copy). This album pretty much has no vocals and nothing that is truly impressive about it. If you're use to the Easy Star All Stars you'll truly be disappointed in this cd because it doesn't match up to radiodread or dub side of the moon. But if you like instrumental reggae with a light but average sound this cd will probably interest you. I would burn a copy for a friend but i don't know if i would convince him to buy it.
4,Good product,"I use this for siding gable ends. Much faster and more accurate than marking and cutting angles by hand. Well worth it if you are going to do more than one house.Downside is it should have been confiqured to be able to slide longer pieces of siding into it. (You cant cut off more than about a foot at a time.) So if you have a 12 foot piece of siding and want to cut an angle at 8 feet, you would have to cut the siding straight across at 9' or less and then slide it in and cut your angle. Or cut it 2 or 3 times on the table until you get your length."
5,Cute!,"This is adorable, but it does have a strong rubbery odor. I'm sure this will dissipate, since it's still brand new.. All in all, so cute and a perfect fit for a Macbook."
5,This is amazing!,"I have been searching forever for a laptop case for my tiny laptop. Although this says it's for a Mac, it fits my HP perfectly. It gives it just enough protection and it fits perfectly in my bag. It is also not plain like all the other one's I have seen. This is a great product and a great price!"
3,eh...,"it's a bit cheesier looking than it seems in the photos, but it fits and fulfills it's function so whaddya gonna do."
2,not what i ordered,"I ordered the stripe sleeve because of the yellow tone of the colors and I got a sleeve with dirty blue-ish looking colors. It's not terrible looking and it's not a bad quality sleeve, but it's not what I wanted."
5,installed this in a 1987 gmc suburban,installed this in a 1987 gmc suburban saved 30 bucks buy not getting it from a parts store. direct factory fitting had it installed and blowing ice cold air in less than an hour. the box was beat to s*** on one side but there was no damage done to part
2,Kind of Boring,"Only 30 minutes in length, I was pretty let down with this ""movie"". I was expecting more background information, and a bit more exciting narrative rather than watching Norma McCorvey speaking in a dull tone for about 20 minutes. This movie didn't really go into detail about the life of Norma and why she decided or how she came into the case of Roe v. Wade. Overall, 2/5."
3,Cuando orson estaba casado con Rita,"Cuando Orson Welles estaba casado con Rita Hayworth rueda este ejemplo de buen cine negro. La primera parte del film es de acción lenta pero la segunda mitad es de gran agilidad.Orson es un marino que es contratado con un abogado para que le conduzca su yate y no resiste los encantos de Rita que logra seducirlo.La película en su época fue un fracaso comercial, que agudizó los problemas de Orson Wells para seguir filmando. Con el paso del tiempo el film ha sido en parte revalorado.Se destaca la escena de la sala de los espejos."
3,Good,"The Lady from Shanghai is not one of Orson Welles best films. The camera work is very interesting and stunning. The story is a bit hard to follow at times. The ""Hall of Mirrors"" scene is amazing. PLEASE SEE MY OTHER REVIEWS."
2,Orson goes Irish,"Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth in a weird film noir. Welles plays Mike O'Hara, a/k/a ""Black Irish"", who falls in love with Hayworth, the trophy wife of a wealthy trial lawyer. The story has a few too many twists to be plausible but the style has the stark urgency that made Welles famous."
5,Orson Welles' Best Film!!,"Lady From Shanghai is an excellently mysterious movie. It is very similar to an Alfred Hitchcock film. Welles has an Irish accent that at first seems unnecesary, but emphasises the unique role he plays as a naive, but buff sailor. He becomes entangled in the deadly web of the woman he loves, the fatal Rita Hayworth. I find this movie to portray Welles at his finest and most handsome hour! I definatly recomend this movie to any Orson Welles fan stuggeling to find a movie where Welles is not only a good actor but a hotty to boot."
4,A signature Orson Welles movie,"Betrayed by the woman he lovedor just played for an all around fool by everybody;the able bodied seaman played by Orson Wellessets up several triple cross movies of the future.The resulting plot is a no win psychological thrillerthat delivers bad guy after bad guy untilthe worm at the middle of the apple is revealed.I liked it, but being used to this kind of plotwith Bogart movies of the 40's and early 50's,the result wasn't as crushing this time around,but this is a very good and well crafted movie."
5,"A far better film than ""Citizen Kane""","I never thought much of ""Citizen Kane"" but this film really grabbed me. A film noir mystery of one intrigue piled on top of another, it is completely satisfying. All of the performances are splendid. No one ever mentions the wonderfully creepy/crazy Phil Anders but he is my favorite actor in the film with his bizarre sing-song delivery of every line (""Oh, YEWL see!"" , ""It's just a liddle Tah-Geht (target) practice!). Welles camerawork is, for once, just right, rather than excessive and distracting. I wish that Welles had let Hayworth keep her red hair (dyed blonde here), but other than that, she is great. A first rate thriller."
2,Acapulco in the 1940's,Welle's pseudo-Irish accent and a homosexual undercurrent between two other characters are just two of the problems that complicate a flimsy and ultimately unbelieveable plot. But the shots of Acapulco in the 1940's are really wonderful and these make sitting through the rest of this nonsense bearable.
4,Orson's at it again!,"This is probably not that well known compared to Orson Wells' masterpiece- Citizen Kane. This is worth checking out, however, if the viewer is interested observing the spectrum of this director's life or to see how modern cinematography came to be. If you truly enjoy the richness of movies from the 40's and 50's, you'll be very entertained by this one!"
4,Great Noir,This a great example of Film Noir.Welles direction is flawless.I enjoyed this film very much.
2,there are better books,"i bought this book because i read the review that gave this five stars. as a resident of washington state, i was very disappointed with the restaurant and hotel suggestions provided. since when should the space needle restaurant be a 'recommended restaurant?' it's pricey and noisy, and the food is ok - exactly what you'd expect from a touristy place. you are better off having a GREAT takeout meal at the buffalo deli on 1st avenue - which has the best sandwiches downtown - and taking your lunch to pike market to watch the ferries.what about great, out of the way places to stay, like pensione nichols, which is inexpensive and charming?you are better off buying the fodor's gold guide, or frommer's guide to washington state if you are looking for 'local color.'"
3,ok for quick review,"Too much information is packed into this book with not as much detail. Its alright if you want just an overview of the attractions / activities.For a more detailed and more personal view of Oregon / Washington, I would recommend ""Hidden Pacific NorthWest"". And no, I've not been paid to publicize this book. hehe. Speaking from my own experience."
3,The Faith of our Fathers,"The printing is way too light. Not like any book I've seen. You must read it in a good light.The pages look like they were were scanned from 8""x11"" sheets of paper that did not come out near dark enough.That being said is not to detract from it's clear and possibly unparalleld explanantion of Christ's Church teachings that has been read by Catholics and non Catholics for years. In that regard it is excellant. The printing itself of this edition should be darker like most of the other editions."
3,oneeyejohn,A good book to understand the Catholic Teaching. If you are looking for the teaching of Jesus Christ you need to go to the bible.
5,"A great case for Canon S30, S40, S45","This case is great. It fits my Canon S30 perfectly. The Tamrac 5694 case is recommended for the Canon S30 but that is really the wrong case for the Canon S30 because it is way too big. Case Logic CPS40 Koskin is really the perfect case. It fits the camera just right. The case is small and compact. It fits the camera snugly but leaves just enough room to fit a media card and lens cloth. No, this case does not have any pockets or fancy compartments but in my opinion this would make the case too bulky. This case has a convenient belt loop instead a shoulder strap or strap that fits around the neck. I think the belt loop is much more practical. You don't have to worry about mistakingly leave the bag somewhere or lugging it around.All and all this is a great case not just for Canons but for any compact digital camera. Plus the price is excellent."
3,URGENT: 2nd Class,"An interesting creative romp with Nick Bantock, but I was looking for more how-to."
1,Disappointing,"This book wasn't what I was hoping for in that the ideas and examples are all too similar in final product. I believe that because I am not looking for altered books genre per se, this book is not for me. I would reallly like to sell it back, otherwise I am stuck with it."
1,Not up to his other works,"I found this book quite disappointing and would not recommend it. It was like talking to Nick at a coffee table (which is interesting, ok) but not worth the money on visuals at all."
3,Eyecatching Graphics,"As in all of Bantock's books, the graphics are outstanding. Text describing techniques, however, is very sparse. If you're looking for instruction on technique, this is not the book to pick up. If you're looking for inspiration and colorful artwork using ephemera, this is a good one-hour read."
3,Some food for thought but pretty thin,"I love Nick Bantock's work, and I was about to take a workshop in which we would illustrate personal narrative by creating convincing ""fake"" documents, so I thought this book would be a fountain of inspiration. It was pretty disappointing. It's almost as if the publisher simply rounded up a bunch of Bantock's unpublished work, created categories for chapters and then got a few comments from him. No techniques described, and so little context for the work presented that it felt more like a quick-and-dirty publishing project to trade on Bantock's name."
3,Urgent . . . second class,"Tbis is a beautifully presented and visually interesting book, the least I would expect from this source. As instruction on how to begin producing art from ephemera, or on tips and tricks of the trade, it is woefully lacking. It is a visual tour with some written commentary; I expected something with more content. However, beauty is its own excuse often, and this is one of those occasions. A beautiful book . . ."
5,Find a place on your bookshelf for this one!,"This is not a new book, but I have only recently discovered it for myself at the local library. After checking it out multiple times, I decided that I needed to make room on my bookshelf for my own copy of this challenge to my own creativity. Neil Bantock is well-known in the Arts/Crafts world, and I have several of his other books already. If you are remotely interested in postal art, or art period, check this one out. I think that you will want to add it to your home library too."
3,Fun little documentary needs better video transfer,"This 1983 documentary interviews many of Phil Spector's mentors, sidemen and professional associates, and is eerily prophetic as several describe his erratic behavior and gun-obsession. Before he became a convicted killer, Spector was a great pop producer, but was never anything less than a ruthless, greedy businessman who exploited his artists mercilessly, as Darlene Love, among others, attests. There is a delightful little interlude with Ms. Love lip-synching to her classic Spector Xmas recording of ""White Christmas"" as she walks along a California beach, among other diverting moments. The interviews with the Ramones, all of whom seem to have detested working with Spector, are classics. However, the color was terribly over-saturated and overall picture quality was not good; this cries out for a professional digital remastering, hence three stars instead of four."
4,"Quirky, interesting documentary","This is the story of eccentric musical genius Phil Spector and the ""girl group"" sound of the '60s that he helped create. Spector has also produced the Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Ramones and many other superstars. Entertaining and insightful, with many rare interviews with those who knew and worked with him throughout the years. I highly recommend this DVD to any fan of pop music."
3,not what I thought it was,"This was not what I thought it was....the company was GREAT in their delivery and service,and the description was ok....I should have realized this was a taping off a PBS special from the late 1990's....after watching for 5 minutes,I realized I had seen this on tv....I dont want to add anything to that dope phil spectors pockets....he was a great music maker,but as a human being,he SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Use of Slick stuff HD Spray,"I have always maintained my vehicles with a sense of pride. I can say without hesitation or reservation that slick stuff is by far the best wax/protectant I have ever used, barring none. For once, I found a product that lives up to its advertising."
5,Return to Hope,"This is an excellant sequel in this particular series; I find it a return to the roots of the series and a distinct step up from the past couple of books. After leaving the world of Hope for the last few books in this series we return to there and to various colonial issues. Here too for the first time the role of the church as it plays in politics is brought into the main themes. We again see Seafort's rather particular sense of honor put to the test in various ways along with the newest of his child ""projects"" Randy Carr who provides the POV for most of this novel.This is a very busy book; plots and sub-plots abound. You need a scorecard to keep track of who is playing what roles as the story unfolds. It is also very fast paced, not an easy book to put down. For serious readers of this series elements (and characters) of the other novels are presented, and occasional loose ends tied up."
3,More of the same,"I have read the entire Seafort saga and have been unable to put any of them down. But I have to say that this last one just seemed like a retread of previous adventures. Randy was just Nick in a different body. And, honestly, after five, six books, Fientuch's obsession with 14 year old boys has started to creep me out. As a woman reading science fiction, it starts to play on one that all the women go insane or get killed or both. So Corrine was a nice surprise, if not a one dimensional character. Nevertheless, these are gripping stories and worth the read."
2,too good to be true..,"I guess the saying is ture, you get what you pay for. But I still think a seller should be HONEST in their description to save us the trouble of purchasing, mailing back, and waiting for a refund.These earrings should not have been described as SI2-I1. There were a few black specks in the diamonds that were VERY visable to the naked eye. Not alot of sparkle in them, but I would've kept them if they didn't have the black specks.They did provide a full refund,so i guess I can't complain too much."
5,Three Novellas by a Great Poet,"Stanley Elkin had a wonderful gift for colorful language and a breezy style, coupled with a narrative gift that brought the reader inside the heads of his characters. ""The Bailbondsman,"" ""The Making of Ashenden,"" and ""The Condominium"" are good examples of these gifts. The range of incident, humor, violence and dramatic confrontation shown in these novellas were marks of Elkin's style. I especially recommend ""The Bailbondsman,"" for in addition its odd twists the story has depth and suspense and surprise. The narrator notices everything, even ""the roller coaster"" of a man's fly when he sits. You have to be ready to be shocked, but you will also find a whimsical streak in the writing that delights. Elkin's final novel, ""Mrs. Ted Bliss,"" might have been a continuation of ""The Condominium."" Highly recommended for all who appreciate fine writing or who are trying to write on their own."
3,Mens Cologne,"This mens cologne product has a strong aroma but pleasant. Shipping the product however is another story. The product does not have a ""top"" to protect it when shipping; it has a ""clip"" type attachment that is supposed to keep the atomizer from spraying during shipping. That ""clip"" does not work. My product arrived timely but there had been some leakage. I think they can vastly improve on that issue by having a normal top to protect the atomizer part."
5,I injoy the smell of a cute man,"Gottschalks is going out of business & got the Box set there 45.00 Spray , deodorant ,& after shave balm & it was cheaper then buying the bottle by its self. the smell is strong and its got woody smell, its unique like surf. again its real strong & it can keep u awake so dont put it on at bed time or u will be sorry u dident. but day time put 2 sprays on your body & it will make u feel good. not every one will like it. I like it so far. I should make youtube videos on all my colognes"
3,Not the best,"I just got my item... 6.8 oz Curve Crush for menFirst off, the packaging was bare. It came in a tin can between two pieces of crumbled brown paper. The brown box it was in was not in the best of shape either.The perfume has an overall Ok (kind of lemony) smell not fantastic and can be used for everyday use. It didnt last very long for me in the night.. so you can imagine for a hot day...."
2,Smells like soap!!!,This is my least favorite Curve ever!!! Smells like soap only! It's a strong smell and will last a few hours but it's nothing like the original Curve which none of the newer one's will ever beat! Would never buy this again and I have had it for years since I don't use it much!!! For this price just buy the original or try a different one!
4,My husband loved it!!,The only downfall is that I dint get the full kit. Aftershave and cream to go with it. I hope to purchase these in the future.
4,good perfume,"I bought it for my boyfriend without knowing the perfume, i was happy that he loved it, and i did too because is not strong but light smell and last for a while. the price is ok for the bottle size."
5,Wow...Love it!!,"I ordered this as a present for my husband and he loved it, I was supposed to receive it on wednesday and I got it today, even faster than what they originaly estimated, it smells great, my husband sprayed some on his shirt like 2 hours ago and stil smells, I hope it really lasts long, for some reason I thought the bottle was going to be smaller but it is huge, love the packaging, cant go wrong with this item, if it is sold by amazon you can bet that you will recieve it fast and in good condition."
1,This is a piece of shit,Kindly don't buy this. It smells okay and evaporates in less than 10 mins. I ordered after reading all the reviews but i realized now that they didn't help me choose a right product.
1,Family man,"I like the curve product by Liz Cliborn, because it has a good and pleasent fragrence. It is mile with out a loud accent."
4,"This stuff is great for the price, the bottle is HUGE.","I have heard of this stuff on many occasions, but never got a chance to check it out. For $30/shipped I figured I would give it a shot. I'm pretty impressed with the smell. The scent lasts very long, and the bottle is huge so it will last you a long time. I wish I could describe the scent but you can check out the other reviews for more information on that. I now use this on a daily basis and wouldn't even think about switching to anything else, this is a pretty good value."
2,Not very satisfied,"The book and library stamps all over it, library stickers everywhere. i feel this should have been disclosed in the description prior to purchase"
2,Bye Bye Good Ole Days,"Josh Todd has killed the gutter-rock sound he did so well.The AC/DC, Aerosmith, and Guns N Roses influence is gone. They have been restored with nu-metal crunchy guitar rockers, and post-grunge Creed-like ballads (SHINE, could be a Creed song). This album is nothing compared to Buckcherry. It sounds like Josh is just trying to cash in on the new movement in music which is sad, because he didn't seem to worry about that before. This album will not appeal to Buckcherry fans, unless you just liked them for Josh's voice."
5,YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE!!!,"Your in the jungle with this fantastic solo debut from Josh Todd ex lead singer of Buckcherry. Gone are the AC/DC, Guns n Roses laden riffs. Inplace more metal than is healthy a real good crossover with THAT voice and the new found sound."
4,EXCELLENT,"This CD is awesome. If you're a fan of Buckcherry you'll definitely like it. While it is a bit different than his stuff with Buckcherry it's still rockin'. The more I listen to it the more I like it. Get it now, you won't be disappointed."
2,Give me a break.,"Buck Cherry was all about sex drugs and rock and roll. Josh Todd the album is about the sensual, the mysterious, the man with a tatoo on his back looking loathingly down at his ankles picturesque in a suavely colored black and white, Josh Todd: Bimbo Rock Magnet.Buck Cherry I loved. It is and always will be up there as one of the greatest kinds of thrasing/heavy rock in it's time. But Josh Todd just got gay. I don't like the title, and the songs are weak. Don't waste your time if you're looking for more of a Buck Cherry feel. It's all but dead. Dissapointing. I tried to like the tracks, but after going through the whole record twice in a row I couldn't bang my head, so now my CD is brooding somewhere in a dark box, just where Josh Todd would like it."
1,"Tired, dissonant ""rock""","After hearing ""Shine"" on the radio I went out and bought this CD, but after struggling to get through the album, I was EXTREMELY dissapointed with the lack of musicality and originality. Its almost as if the songs were all written in one day. Its really too bad, I like Buckcherry, but Josh Todd does not have the talent nor image to carry a band as a frontman. Don't waste your money."
1,The Art of Erotic Photography,"As a college professor who has taught various levels of photography since 1981 I have seen a lot of videotapes on photography of various types, and I don't recall anything as bad as this videotape. The only reason I keep the videotape at all is to show it as an example of how NOT to do a videotape or go about a photo shoot. The segment with the sea-turtle was disgusting and uncalled for. If this tape is purchased for the sole purpose of gawking at nude women then it might be ok, but if the intent is to actually learn something about photography, save your money and look elsewhere. Professor Larry J. Howard Eastfield College"
1,Waste of Money and Videotape,"I can't think of anything good to say about this video. Even the most rudimentary things where not explained in any detail, i.e. ""cameras and lenses are vulnerable"". Duh! Lots of filler segments with no commentary whatsoever, let alone good photographic advice. The few photographic techniques mentioned were not adequately explained, and not one photograph was explained in complete detail. Then there was the awful ""capture a sea turtle"" segment - again, no photgraphic commentary. The viewer might get some artistic ideas from watching it, but the same would result from about an hour of surfing the web. Horrid example: comments about indoor bounce flash lighting were made during an outdoor shoot. Amazon needs a ZERO stars rating for this one."
5,This product is a life saver !,"I was suffering from internal hemorrhoids. I was bleeding every time i went to the bathroom. I tried several things, and even went to the doctor who gave me a cream that worked but was very messy to apply. I finally discovered venapro by searching online. I thank GOD that i bought the product. Just by using it for two days only my bleeding became very less and the i had less pain at my bottom. It has been only a week now since I have been using this product and I think my problem is totally gone. I will continue for a few months. Remember you must eat atleast 25-35grams of fiber which will really help. Also, eating less in the evening helped. Eating variety of fruits also helped me. Thanks and Good luck. You must try this product !"
4,normal,it's normal even i use it for 3 weeks there are a little change i'll use it for 2 month so it will help for sure ^_^
3,Good!!,"The product doesn't work immediately when I took it. It takes a while to start feeling it's benefits, but after a few days it starts working, I didn't have any problems when using but the flavor is not the best!! Good purchase though."
1,Terrible Side Effect!,This product claims that there are no side effects but this is not true. After not even two days of using the product (3 of the colon pills and 5 sprays) I experienced the worst diarrhea I have ever had. It was awful. It lasted about 36 hours and was very difficult to control with anti-diarrheal medications. I was extremely dehydrated and it felt like I was preparing for a colonoscopy. Definitely check with your doctor before using this product and I would even suggests starting with smaller doses so that you can see how your body will react.
3,Maske: VIE Needs an Editor,"More a mystery than a sci-fi, Maske: Thaery has all the elements that make for a classic Vancian read: arch dialogue, a melancholic cynicism toward society, a rippin' plot that keeps one turning the pages, and an abiding fondness for food, tipple, and trees. I'd actually rate this book higher than three stars, but the particular edition depicted by Amazon is a recent reprint from ibooks that utilizes the efforts of the VIE Project, whose volunteers remove edits made by prior publishers so as to restore Vance's works to their original text. It's a noble but ultimately naive objective, as indicated by the unfortunate repetition of sentences on page 4 of the VIE edition. Readers new to Vance might want to instead seek out the original (1976) edition of this book."
1,WHOA! They forgot something,"I've been using GoLive since it was called Cyberstudio and owned by another company. I therefore rushed to buy this update and was utterly shocked when I got home.GoLiveCS does not have the built in support for dynamic content that was in the previous version (6.0). The PHP/Mysql/asp interface for creating database driven websites is totally gone! Apparently Adobe thought no one was using it so they axed it. Let me tell you, as one of the ones who was using it, this has rendered this ""upgrade"" into a ""downgrade"" that I would never have bought had I known. Unfortunately, neither the store I bought it at nor Adobe will refund my money.I've gone back to 6.0. I'm hoping a third-party vendor creates a PHP/MYSQL plug-in that I can use, or I might just have to switch to dreamweaver. You can also check the Adobe forums on their website for more details about the ""loss"" in this upgrade."
2,Save Your Money!,"I purchased this after reading the reviews and figured it would smell very nice and somewhat along the line of the original Very Sexy For Him .... Not! Although the smell is okay, it is definitely not as nice as the original Sexy in the Black Bottle. I was really disappointed. I strongly suggest spending less and buying the smaller bottle first to insure you are going to like the fragrance, as opposed to buying the larger bottle like I did and be stuck with a frangrance that you really don't like that much. Oh well, that is the one of the ones that I'll keep out for my friends to use when they come over!"
5,AMAZING! FLAT OUT AWESUM!!,"Amazing. BEST SERIES EVER a must buy....unless you hate halo, in which case you should jump off a cliff.Because it is so awesomw, great drop dead amazing, you should buy all of the seasons and every simple episode."
3,For the Halo centric only.,"Entertaining for about 30 minutes or so, pretty corny and gets old fast unless you are an absolute Halo connoisseur."
2,Endurance trial,"Maybe it gets better later on, but I don't' think I laughed once during the nearly two hours I watched."
2,Huh?,This is like a really long Halo like game dubbed with bad graphic and mediocre comedy. Couldn't justify watching more than 10 min of it.
1,Ridiculous,"Watched the first 3 minutes of this video. Wasn't sure what to expect, but the vile language (for no apparent purpose) quickly made it apparent this was not for me."
1,Duh,Feels like a couple of college bro's wrote this in their dorm room--a disrespect to the Science Fiction genre. Then again--it got a lot of good reviews. Maybe I'll stop watching films based on Amazon reviewers.
4,Goofy. Funny.,"It is funny. If you're in the mood for something a little different, and completely off the wall, then you might like this."
5,Ridiculously funny!,"This is a parody of the Halo game, but it doesn't require you to have played this game, I sure haven't. Mild knowledge of similar games or type of game will keep you laughing at every single joke and situation and you will still be able to fully appreciate the cleverness of this series. The audio quality of this first series is not the best, maybe the creators had used cheap recording mics, nevertheless this is not a hollywood production and being well aware of that it doesn't take much away from the comical nature of this. Very clever and funny. I'd give it 4.5 stars (-1/2 star for audio, but amazon doesn't let you do that)!"
1,Wow is this bad,Please do not buy why? because it is totally worthless and is a total rip off and definitely not entertainment of any kind
1,dumb voiceover of a video game,dumb and a voice over of a video game. really dull. Why would someone waste time watching this? Let alone making it.
1,Stunningly Stupid,"To sum up, why would I want to watch a video game when I can play it? I watched about three minutes of this thing. I was originally under the impression it was an anime style film about Halo but was sorely mistaken. It's simply nothing more than the in-game graphics from the video game being dubbed. I would much rather play the game than watch something that makes it feel like I'm watching someone else play for me.Don't waste your time with this one."
2,Not as strong as you think,I purchased this to attach new pant fasteners and fix some seams on my dress pants. I was told by many seamstresses that this type of thread is the best to use because it has a high tensile strength and is hard to see on a pair of pants. Well... this brand apparently doesn't have too high of a tensile strength as I've been able to break seams and fasteners off my pants quite easily before even wearing them. I can not recommend this product for the aforementioned use.
1,Rubbish! Just wasting of money!,"For who is it invisible?! For the blind people?Hoped to show some ""magic"" to my friend but even I see this shiny and thick thread with my poor eyesight and without glasses!"
3,NOT available in Mp3.,"It's great that Amazon lets you listen to audio samples for the Film Score Monthly releases, but the audio samples seldom match the actual track chosen. I've found that to be true with every FSM release I've listened into. With Lust for Life, Amazon claims it's also available in Mp3, which is not true! The link will take you to a rock(?) CD called ""Life"" by Everett James. So do not click the button that will automatically buy you the wrong CD!"
4,Good for small camcorders.,"I have a Panasonic DV-51 (cool camcorder for beginner) and this bag is just the right thing for it. It has 2 front zipped pockets which can hold the cables and adapter/charger. You will have to squeeze in the tapes and extra battery with the camcorder. You can resize compartments inside the bag. This helps to make space for batteries, tapes etc. You wont be able to use this bag for Sony Digital8 camcorders as they are pretty big and will be the only thing which you can fit in the available space. I would advise against using this bag for any camcorder heavier/bigger than the Panasonic PV-DV51."
2,Skip This!,"This is very dull. Often, personification makes things so much more interesting. Here the process is reverse and so is the effect. It is most unnatural, not being able to see the dancers faces or expressions. And even their movements and actions mimic those of wooden dolls. Photograhy is poor too. Just terrible! The music is quite alright though."
5,Writing the Winning Dissertation: A Winning Guide!,"Writing the Winning Dissertation was the only guide I needed when writing my dissertation. After I completed my research study and began to try to pull my data and research information together in a cohesive manner, I was at a loss. This book led me step-by-step through the process. The guide is straight-forward and easy to follow. It explains exactly what you need to include in your dissertation and describes the order in which the information should occur. For me, it was a lifesaver!"
3,a mix of Made-for-TV movies and Foreign Horror.,"Horror Classics - 2 Disc SetHorror Classics, Vol. 5- Silent Night, Bloody Night (1973)- Scared to Death (1947)- Good Against Evil (1977)- Kill, Baby... Kill! Operazione paura 1966)Horror Classics, Vol. 6- Snowbeast (1977)- Moon of the Wolf (1972)- Night Train to Terror (1985)- Devil's Nightmare, The Plus longue nuit du diable, La 1971)Kill, Baby...Kill is Mario Bava. Moon of the Wolf was made for TV. Scared to Death has Bela Lugosi. The Transfers are okay. I have not checked to see if the Bava filmed was trimmed down."
4,Nice comfortabel bag with plenty of room.,"Now THIS is a bag. The main compartment is roomy enough to hold most camcorders (or cameras with an extra lens + flash). There's a padded divider which you can move around to fit exactly the cam you have.The front accessory pockets are great for keeping tissues, spare film, booklets, pens, etc. (You *know* some gum will end up in there. lol)The detachable pack is the best part in my opinion. I currently have it off on my bag, but there are times when I need to pack extra supplies and it's great for quickly attaching to the bag. This is a must have option/feature that you should always look for!"
2,Old news,This system cost as much as much faster systems. Why pay the money for a 1.8GHz CPU when you can have a 2.4GHz CPU? Maybe this was a good deal last year but it's out of date now.
4,It was never there!,"Another taster of MTV's dynamic duo. I only wish MTV would still have them. Get rid of those reality shows and boy bands. However, the music video vignettes are not included for legal reasons. Also, it focuses away from the plot most of the time. I'm sure Mike Judge would allow actors to do the boys' voices since there are many people who could. ""King of the Hill"" looks too realistic."
5,"The common sense: what to write, how to write it, and why",This book helps you to improve your writing. It gives you the steps to get your writing into the desired shape.
2,Imaginitive first half - disastrous second half,"Liked the first half in which Blervaque constructs a new deep-vein method of interfacing consciousness with his new VR game.Sadly, the second half (secret hacker commune) is dull and disastrous. It's a pity. With a better plot, this SF novel could have been superb."
1,Disappointing Drivel,This is a sad attempt at modern science fiction. I was appalled by the lack of continuity and the plotting errors. Remainder Bin here I come!
2,"Very small, took too long to ship","I, admittedly, must not have read closely enough, but this cookie cutter is very small--much too small for what I needed. I wanted it for baking individually decorated and wrapped shower favors but this was far too small to use for that. Read the size description closely.It also took far longer than normal to receive the item. I received it a day past the last date in the delivery estimate and 11 days after I ordered it. Interestingly it didn't ship until I contacted the company to complain. And then it happened to ship later the same day. They claimed that it took 7 days for them to receive the clearance notification from Amazon, which is usually due to an issue with charging the credit card. I however, buy from Amazon A LOT with the exact same payment information. I'd never experienced this kind of slowness nor did I receive any notification of a problem with my payment information."
3,Good information but limited model,"Does not have all SUV model. I've RAV4 and Previa. Nothing covered. Every time I have to enter the CD, to run the software. Otherwise it will run with limited information. When installing the software, if somebody makes a mistake(wrong model), it cann't be deleted and reinstalled. But it be installed different model in different computer. Other than, step by step pic. and good description. Easy to follow."
4,We need more this this singer,Great singer. Sentimental and far reaching into your heart. Where are his cds?? We want to purchase.
5,Takes me back to the 50s,"If you have never heard this guy, this album is a wonderful way to get introduced to him. His voice is super and very flexible -- can sing almost anything! This album has a lot of the older songs and is just fabulous. Even my little grandkids got a big kick out of singing along with it in the car. It is a definite ""feel good"" album."
4,Gerard Joling--No More Boleros CD,Had never heard of Gerard Joling until I received a email video with No More Boleros as background music. Found his CD at Amzon.com. Love his voice and his music.
3,post surgical support hose,This prototype postsurgical support hose is extremely difficult to put on and very annoying once you are ambulatory. They have an opening to check the condition of your feet but it is on the bottom of the foot. I prefer the Jobst hose which have the opening on the top of the foot.Jobst Anti-Em Thigh-Hi Large-Regular (toe: White)pr
1,BORING!!!,"Listen, I read poems every day at school. I have OCD , and this ""poem"" sounds like Shakesphere was yaching up a dictionary. If you read this poem, and hate it, write a response and give me credit"
4,A nice introduction,"Whilst I am quite familiar with the tarot, I had not delved into the world of Wicca and didn't really know where to start. This book gives a nice overview of some of the more famous names in magical history and a page or two on subjects such as Places of Magic (sacred spaces, circles), Spellcraft (candle magic, chants) and the Path of Magic (rituals, practices and observances). Also included is information on divination techniques and other practices of witches and wizards.Other readers indicate inaccuracy of some of the information so I accept that could well be the case. The subject matter is only touched on lightly though so I imagnie that not too much harm is done by inaccuracy at this level.The book itself is a lovely change from the usual paperback. Hardcover with beautiful illustrations throughout, I found it to be a pleasent overview to begin with."
5,Great,"I have one and it hits harder than my ma auido 15, its a trooper too its only rated at 1500Watts RMS but i have it wired for 4400watts RMS and it hasent buned up yet. its better in a ported box i had it sealed and it sucked. i cant wait to build a custom box for it, ill be buying anouther one soon."
3,powerful,its a beast but they get hot not bad for the price if anything get some kicker L7s will not be disappointed
4,Good basic laser printer.,"Purchased this printer refurbished....a bit hesitant, but everything works fine and there's a full one year warranty.Printer is a bit deeper than normal due to the paper tray sticking out the back, so it makes a bit larger footprint than some other models.The first page takes a few moments to get started, but once going the print speed is fine for this level of printer.Product registration / information / set-up all are easy and seem to be great.Memory is the only issue...the standard 2MB is fine for text, but if you're going to be printing a lot of black & white pictures or graphics, you would definately need to upgrade the memory. Not really an issue for me, though. It will still print the graphics, just at a lower resolution.Otherwise, very happy w/ this purchase."
4,Exceeds Expectations,"I would highly recommend this printer. For the price, you can't beat it. Set up was super easy, the pages look great and it's relatively quiet.My only knock is that there doesn't seem to be a way to do a wireless set-up without using a proprietary Brother adapter or router. (I did some research - enough to be disheartened.) And I so wanted to use an Airport Express, but there doesn't seem to be a way to make it work with this model."
2,Brother HL 1440 Laser Printer,"I have used this laser printer since 2003. I print about 150 pages per month. In all that time, I have had one paper jam and I use the cheapest paper I can find. ThoughI have used two toner cartridges but there is no sign of drum wear.I would not hesitate to buy a remanufacturedBrother 1440. I might add that Brother is just great about answering technical questions fast and free,despite the fact that I bought the machine four years ago. The only down side is the machine's size."
3,Second one is pretty good...,"I ordered this printer based on its specs. The first unit had a horrible grinding noise as it fed paper, and it did not feed the paper all the way out. Amazon made it easy to send it back, and the replacement works OK. It does sometimes have trouble ""waking up"" when it receives a print job; I have yet to find a fix for that issue. Otherwise it is a very good printer so far -- crisp and clean text, and very fast."
1,Flawed product,"I Have worked with two of these printers, one at work and a second i later purchased for the home. Both printers after about a year required the purchase of a new drum assembly, which costs as much as the printer. The drum becomes defective, it streaks the output. Customer service was no help, and refused to acknowledge that this is a common problem. I have read on other boards people having the same experience. I still use mine, but not for anything that needs to look good."
2,Do not buy the refurbished one~,The toner went out very very fast. Mine die after less than 500 pages of light printing. Be prepared to buy a new toner Cartridge soon if you decide to buy this thing.
2,e-mail won't stay within margins,"I am about to return this printer because when I try to print e-mail (from 2 different e-mail programs) the printer cuts off the edges of the page - doesn't print with a wide enough margin. I have spent hours trying to figure out how to fix this, including about half an hour waiting for a tech support person from Brother who was no help at all. If you don't want to print all your e-mails in landscape mode, don't get this printer!"
5,So Comfortable and cute!,I wear these shoes for work. A nice basic black shoe with just a little detail to set them apart from regular black pumps. These shoes are quite comfortable and the leather wears well.
2,Can't be Compaq's work alone,"My mother's computer was getting old. It was a compaq with 500mHZ and 40 gb and a single cd drive (i put a writer in) and a floppy of course. However 3 weeks ago the cd drive quit working, and her modem went out. The Floppy also went out. So i went shopping on Amazon. I found this. I knew it would be true to my Mom for years to come. I ordered it, i set it up. It went VERY slow for 2100 mHZ. My mother loves it. It does OF COURSE go faster then her 500mHZ old computer. But it still ran really slow. It ran at the speed of my sisters computer, 900mHZ. It surprised me. The gb is awesome. however if you are a person who is constantly using computers. Especially gaming. Then get the other compaq i listed in another review."
5,Eternal and mystifying Persian music at its best,"Shahram Nazeri, Hossein Alizadeh, and the rest of the orchestra produce very inspirational and enlightening music that everyone who has an Iranian family background or interest in Persian culture should buy."
4,Very cute ring,"The stone does not look much like the picture (the stone is more translucent), but the ring is still very nice. Worthwhile if you catch it on sale."
4,How difficult to reach the top ...,"The increasing difficulties in achieving original results or, more likely, in developing non repetitive hints become quite clear in this textbook.An averagely expert professional has happened to meet most impossibilities quoted in the book, and experienced how integration issues are often the synthesis of sociological, psychological, technical and economical facets. Unfortunately, the wider the scope an essay aims to, the more vagueness it risks.Good writing, proper references and sound solutions are not enough to stand out against the equally good tens of publications available about the subject. Like as many of them, it becomes a very elegant source for material to speak ABOUT the work in data warehouse environment (a treasure for slide shows!), or that can be very useful to present the whole of it to a beginner, but carrying out an actual development is a different matter."
1,Not what I ordered,"I specifically ordered an IBM 80 GB HD, I needed one that was specifically not a Western Digital brand as it was a replacement for a hard drive in an Avio Editting machine. Avio specifically stated no Western... I received a Western instead of the IBM one... needless to say this was returned and I bought the drive elsewhere."
5,Excellent seller.,"As ordered, my VHS arrived in a timely manner, well packed and undamaged. The quality rating appears accurate (have not viewed tape yet, but have no reason to doubt that it too will be as promised).Thank you guys. It was a pleasure doing business with you."
4,Two Early SYLVESTER Albums On One Disc...,"This Fantasy Records copmilation is essentially Sylvester's first (self-titled) release from 1977 and 1981's ""Too Hot To Sleep"" album rolled into one compilation. The cover can be a bit confusing. Of course, it would have been PROPER for the label to pay it's respects to this amazing entertainer by releasing his other albums indivudially. There was 1978's ""Step II"" (with ""Mighty Real"" and ""[Dance] Disco Heat"" on them), his ""Stars"" EP from 1979 and 1980's ""Sell My Soul."" You can track them down (except for ""Stars"") via the UK label Ace Records. This compilation is good for fans. Stay real."
1,A virtually unusable booklet,"The print in this book was pretty small, making it very hard to read. The pictures, which were supposed to explain what certain things look like, were so unclear that you couldn't tell what they were. In some cases, the pictures were faded so much so that they didn't look like a picture at all. For us, the book is pretty much unusable and a complete waste of money."
5,Solid Album,"This is the first album I've purchased by Osunlade, and I wasn't disappointed in the least. What struck me on the first listen was the production, really superb, clean ---panning vocals, emphasis on rhythm, etc.This is usually grouped into the house music section, and even though the feeling of house is present (positive vibe, makes you wanna move) only a few of the tracks are straight house. Many are much closer to jazz, but with the producer's spin on it becomes something more akin to studio-manipulated jazz.Latin and African influences are present on the percussion, as well as the aforementioned house. Throw in some synths, woodwinds, and a string section, and you should get as close of an idea as you can without actually hearing it.That having been said, check it out. A solid album, and is probably going to be a little underrated and overlooked in contrast to the actual worth of the recording."
3,It isn't really wall mountable.,The speakers are way too huge to be mounted. It needs flat speakers too. Sound quality is so-so.
1,Not for MP3 users,"Wife bought the product as a present. Unit couldn't read any mp3 cds (from different brands) nor could it read any cds created via Windows Media or other brand cd burning software. It was simply useless as a product for non-commercially created CDs. My car has a much older CD-player that could read the Windows Media-created disc....Just a pathetic product, IMHO. Also, there is no transition from CD1 to CD2....Doesn't make any sense there either."
4,"Rhetorics of Surveillance: Good Book, Bad Layout.","its got it all. this book has a wide collection of wonderful text on the history, use, politics, future, and concepts of surveilence. its like a text book, but its not. the only complaint i have is the foot notes are in the middle of the pages in a ligher font and it makes it kind of hard to read the actual text on the page. and they have these red lines all over the place in the background of the text. good book, bad layout."
5,excellent time travel,"This book setting is Montana 1888.I am currently on my second reading of & am enjoying it as much or more than the first time. The characters become old friends immediately. It's an easy read with parts that make you cry and some that make you laugh right out loud.Maeve's adventure with the sheep is absolutely unique & so easy to picture in your mind as the writer does such a marvelous job of describing it.It's a grand love story & I'm sure I'll read it again in a few years. Definitely on my ""keeper"" shelf."
4,Final album,"As the last release before Cannonball's untimely death it is a recap of some of his classic songs played in his funk popular style of his later years. If you have listened to Cannonball from the 50's with Miles through his days with Joe Zawinul, it is rather fun."
1,Not much of any challenge. I am at a point where I need to lose some weight and this was not at all helpful.,Not much of any challenge. I am at a point where I need to lose some weight and this was not at all helpful.
5,good,"I am so glad to have these around for snacking. The stores around here don't always stock them so it was nice to get an entire boxful, which I am still eating."
2,Keepin' It Highbrow,"I guess you can learn a lot about a person based upon the art she collects. I also liked seeing an art lecturer be so excited about her subjects. I am glad that the lecturer did not ignore Queen Christina's dressing in male clothing or having female lovers.Still, this was a very highbrow discussion. I am not sure why the lecturer dressed as if she were going to a presidential inaugural ball. You might not want to hear two hours worth of ""The Queen owned this painting and that one and the next one.""This won't be interesting to most, but the small intended audience will love it. Those who liked fictional productions about these queens may love this lecture as well."
5,Just right & priced right,"I have purchased three of these over the past year. For the money, this compact portable speaker system is great. My wife uses one for her IPOD Nano in the kitchen and the other two are used as supplemental speakers for two laptop computers we own. In both roles, these speaker work great. They won't blow you away but for an average size room, they do fill the room with sound nicely. These speakers can't compare with offerings from BOSE costing 10 to 15 times more but if you keep your expectations in check you won't be disappointed."
4,Please with my daugther ipod nano,"Review this product over the internet, and it is just what I was looking for my daughter of twelve years of age, pros. is portable and rechargable; cons. the sound is not as good as the Boose but with less volume it is quite acceptable"
1,inMotion iMmini Portable Audio System for iPod Mini,"Poor sound quality when you turn up the volume even a notch. Complete distortion as even my 10 year old pointed out. It reminded me of the old ""transitor"" radios from long ago. Completely unsatisfied and returned it immediately. I might have gotten a lemon as a friend of mine purchased the exact same item and hers sounds great."
1,waiting for refund,"We purchased this for my daughter's ipod nano. Initially it worked with her Nano, then the next day her Nano stopped working. We figured the audio system was not compatable with her nano. Apple will not stand by their warrenty if you use anything other than Apple products so we decided to return it. They received the product over 1 1/2 months ago(I had tracking on the package), I emailed two weeks ago and still have not received a refund. This was purchased from Alway$deal,Inc."
4,Absolutely worth the price!,"This is a nice little sound system for the price. It is loud enough to fill a small room, and works great on a nightstand or desk. The speakers did not come with a remote, but the Griffin iClick (Amazon/Office Depot $14.99) works well with the Altec Lansing system. The only downside is that the remote will not control the iPod's volume when it is attached. Overall a good buy!"
2,Worked great for a while,I loved this speaker system when I got it last year. But in the last few months it developed a loud humming noise that makes it so you can not hear your music. Very disapointed.
4,Very good for the money,"I also was very skeptical when I bought this speaker, but I have been pleased with it. I wanted something small and light enough to fit in a backpack, but that would allow me to listen to music in a hotel room or a campsite. It has been perfect for this purpose, and it takes up about as much room as a paperback book. It does not provide the quality sound that speakers 4 times the price do, but it is great for the price. Since it can also act as a charger when plugged in, it saves you from buying or carrying that item as well. It also can be powered by 4 AA batteries. It lasts about 16-20 hours on my rechargable batteries."
3,It's O.K. --- Not Spectacular,"Given the fine name of Altec Lansing in electronics, I was pleased to find this unit. After a extensive search of similar models, I chose this because of design and fuction. I wanted a source for music while on my balcony. Without a power-source out there, the unit had to be battery powered (4AA's) as well as ac. The only ""variable"" I did not checkout was sound-quality. This is where this unit suffers.The iMini plays passibly only at half volume. Crank it up and the distortion takes over. Perhaps using the unit in a small room might work, but outdoors, forget it! I not sure of that ""maxxBass"" either. Not much bass response. Of course it's an inexpensive unit with small speakers, but I had hoped for better sound.On the plus side, the design enables you to easily view your iPod Mini for song information. It folds up into a nice little package for easy portability."
4,Works well with ipod nano,I gave this as a gift to my niece. I helped her set the ipod up and showed her how to use the speakers. Everything worked well and she loved it. Great for the price.
5,Great Sound,I use this with my Classic iPod. Sound is great and it was worth the money. I like to listen to music when I work much to the chagrin of my colleagues. Plays rock music but does not play rap. Good thing!
5,Big sound in such a small package,"Do you want a portable audio system? This one rocks! The sound quality is amazing for it's size. Not meant to be a party machine, but a personal high quality stereo.It works as a docking station and a charging system as well. Although this system was designed for iPods, it will also work with anything that has an 1/8"" mini headphone jack, because it has an 1/8"" mini input jack.Another nice thing about this is the AC adapter. It has easily switchable international adapters for people who travel abroad.Warning: If you have set your volume in iTunes to 100% and changed your EQ settings, you may hear distortion at high volume. To fix this, reset all volumes in iTunes to 50%, re-sync your iPod, and then on your iPod, turn your EQ off."
3,"fine, if bought at a good price","The Altec Lansing inMotion iMmini does the job, if you're not too picky about sound quality and don't want to play it loud. I like that it is powered either by batteries or AC. Unfortunately, the unit turns itself off when not in use, even when plugged in, so don't expect to use it with your iPod as an alarm clock. That is a good feature otherwise, especially when on battery power. It did also work well with my brother-in-law's Zen MP3 player, although of course it doesn't charge non-iPods. Sound is fine at medium to low listening volumes but distorts significant as you approach max volume, if that's a surprise to anyone. Our JBL onStage has much better sound, but it also cost much more and doesn't run on batteries. All in all, I wouldn't pay full retail for it (or even half-retail), but for what I did pay ($20), I am happy with it."
2,What detail level are you writing your procedures?,I found this book to be written for someone that is at a very detailed level of writing procedures. If you are just writing general department procedures this book may not be for you.
2,hard to listen to CD,"I ordered this CD based on five star in Amazon but the sound is very low quality, looks like recorded in one concert"
4,Pleased,"Happily this round corner cutter worked very well, even on my gloss printed card stock without ever jamming."
4,Perfect,Does the job perfectly - the slots make it easy to ensure your corners line up with the edges. Exactly what I needed. Highly recommend.
4,Corner Rounder,"Product works well. Although, sometimes it doesn't make a clean cut. I usually just trim the edges that are uneven."
3,"works, but not very well","I used 39 lb paper, and had trouble making this punch work consistently. Also, after a short amount of time, the lever started to stick."
2,Worked Well,I got this to round the corners after I trimmed my Crystal Visions Tarot deck. It's pretty simple and easy to use. Some of the corners didn't turn out as nice as others but the scissors took care of that. I love my deck so much better now that I have gotten rid of the borders. I think that although the medium rounder worked fine the smaller one might have worked a little better because a little bit of the wording was trimmed off on the High Priestess card. No matter I still am happy with the results.Update: While trimming my 4th deck the corner puncher has started to jam so badly I'm afraid I will not be able to finish my deck. Once I get through it I will toss this in the trash where it belongs.
5,exactly what I needed,I picked this up as part of my Project Life 2013 supplies. It's small and sturdy. I can cut 2 sheets at a time with it too. LOVE it.
4,A comprehensive guide to PE curriculum,"I brought this book in preparation of my final year dissertation on primay PE curriculum. I've found this book very comprehensive and informative. This book is especially useful on the topic of different models for PE curriculum. This book gives a balanced view on the pros and cons of PE curriculum models. However, the topic of curriculum evaluation only focuses on pupils' assessment but fails to look at the marco level of programme evaluation. I hope there will be supplement in future revision."
3,Too broad.,"There just isn't enough information in this book- it tries to tackle such a large subject and ends up falling short for instance when giving specs on models of tractor it only gives the specs for one model out of the line like for the 20 series they only would give specs for say the 4020- not the 3020 or with the 40 series only the 4440 not the 4240, or 4640. Overall it is a disappointment."
5,Well Done,"This Originally aired as a PBS Special. It is well done. Many key people are interviewed and it tells the history of the cathedral, especially the last few years of construction. Music from the cathedral choir and Marine Corps band are heard throughout the video. I recommend watching this prior to seeing the Cathedral, as you will appreciate the effort behind it. I was moved by watching it and recommend it to anyone."
1,Dishonest,"What the two authors don't tell you is that for a true Stalinist Revolution to take place - the entire middle class would have to be destroyed or is that what their actually calling for.To learn about the vermin also known as progressives, statists and liberals buy American Progressivism or The Forgotten Man."
1,Written by a hacker?,"Definitely not written by an author this book is a jumble of information. Not explained well, a lot of the data is incorrect anyway and general assumptions are made without proof to back them. A lot seems to be the author's opinion rather than actual fact, and in a technological industry, you really need to prove your statements. Technical people will buy this to learn from, so will need more than just opinions to implement security in their networks. I didn't feel that I got a good step-by-step walkthrough of how to fully secure our network--many options and tools are presented but mainly the book leaves you paranoid that you cannot fully protect your company. I liked Hacking Exposed better because it was less general and left me with fewer decisions and questions. Also I felt the book was heavy with with charts and reference lists and not enough detailed explanation of ""why"" and ""how"". Just a lot of ""what"". I need more explanation and insight."
2,"Much covered, not well-explained","Not a very well-executed demonstration of network security knowledge in my opinion. Too much material is covered in a not-well organized way. Lots of odds and ends are included but not well-explained and diagrams not very helpful. I didn't get as much out of this as I expected. It's a jumble of code, networking protocols and hacking software descriptions. I don't need code. I need real instructive information on security."
2,"Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer","The best defense is a good offense and John's book tries to help plan that offense. It is important to be wary of those around you and know how to protect your assets from unexpected breaches in security. Statistics show that the most serious security breaches are internal attacks (trusted employees) rather than external, but it is important to be prepared for both. This book aims to help network security people do just that but falls short of its goal. This book is a good attempt at teaching security, but doesn't quite make the grade."
5,recommended with reservation,"hack attacks revealed is best of the breed. i recommend to everyone who has ever asked 'how to hack'. be sure to read every page. this will save you time and effort wasted with search engines. hack attacks denied falls along the same line as revealed, but i recommend with reservation as denied really follows revealed closely. don't buy this book first as you can get lost in some fortifying steps. you need to refer to revealed during much of the text. they are a great set."
5,These books rocked!,"Out of all of my books, I must say that this book and Hack Attacks Revealed are the best. If you're a beginner or intermediate in network and internet security or ""hacking"", these books are very good to start learning from. Even if you are more advanced, there is important information and they can be used as a great reference material."
4,This book is a valuable asset to your networks.,An industry innovative Internet-based book about security. From front-line experience the author helps in the development and application of fully integrated firewall solutions. Some of these use realtime leveraging of incomming packets.
5,A great book to have,Most of the security problems are creatively illustrated. The example cases were informative and the companion CD was all that the book said it would be. Overall a great book to have.
5,My 2-cents,A long awaited provocative look on Security & Hacking within corporate networks and home computers. Makes excellent read both for the simple and technical minds.
4,Very happy with this dynamic duo,"I have read Hack Attacks Revealed and I'm almost finished with this book. All I can say is if you're looking for complete coverage on this hot topic, then try this pair. Alone the software and security fixes pay for these books."
5,one of the best books I've read,"Those who can distinguish top level books will apreciate this one. Those who think that online tutorials, reading of news groups etc. can educate them better will change their minds and buy this book. To be short, it is a must for anyone, who is interested in information security."
4,The steps you must take to lockdown the gaping holes,"Part 2 Denied is a great sequel to Revealed. Chirillo does a good job of introducing and illustrating the steps you must take to lockdown the gaping holes learned in the first book. Chirillo keeps your attention by using the same unique style from Revealed, following each issue in order as introduced there."
1,Excessive Code and re-directs to his first book,"I bought this book online and never had a chance to preview it first hand. It's amazing how some books get published. There are constant references to his previous book. It crazy how many pages are just code. Nice if your a programmer I guess. Many references to their 'great' security programs too. Towards the end of the book there is 20 pages of a discovery, for what???? The one plus is the chapter on security policies. It's nothing outstanding, but compared to the rest of the book, it's literary art. Buy another book like 0735708681, which covers the same material, but is excellent."
4,Don't need coffee in the mornin,"I agree, together with Hack Attacks Revealed, this is a real eye-opener. I like how the author gets right to the point."
1,"NO, NO, NO","Boring, bad structured, a lot of errors, too shallow, and full of not backed up assumptions.If you are really interested in 'Hack Attacks . .' then try the very recent 'Hack Proofing Your Network (2nd Edition)', quite up to date and comprehensive."
5,Hack Attacks Series,"The information contained is an eye opening look at how vulnerable companies are. By delving into the world of the hacker, it provides a unique view of what makes hackers tick, and ultimately how to better protect against them. This information along with the tools provided, make this a must have in your library."
5,great example of corporate america's power,Store Wars is but one example of how the big chain stores are changing the face of America and the world. It is encouraging to see a small community fight a giant like WalMart even if at the end the battle is lost in a way. Very well done film!!
4,Truth forever on the scaffold,"I bought this for my kindle because I wanted to read the poem from which the line ""Truth forever on the scaffold, Wrong forever on the throne"" came. I ran across this line in one of Dr. King's sermons from A Knock at Midnight. I haven't read much more of the book, so cannot comment on it as a whole, but for the kindle price which was either free or basically free, it is certain worth the download."
5,the best bib I've tried,"This bib will keep the sleeves clean on baby's shirts. It has great coverage and it's easy to keep clean. It has never gotten smelly, like some other bibs I have tried. It dries quickly after machine washing. Very well-made and durable material that does not leak through. Also a consideration is that it's American-made and does not contain PVC, vinyl, or other chemicals of concern."
4,Godd product,"This bib is a good product. Keeps baby clean from chin to wrist plus, he loves the sound it makes!!"
5,excellent product,we love this bib! it works well for our one year old who tends to try to pull off her bib.
4,sleeved bibs - useful,"These bibs are very useful. They have a good size with fitted ends on the sleeves, and dry quickly after laundry. Also, they are textile and do not give one the feeling of packing the child into a plastic foil. The only drawback is that the crumb-catch-all pocket would need some wire or similar to keep it open to do its job more effectively."
5,Love this bib!,"I bought this for my son, he is 12 months old and he is always messing up his cloths when he eats :) This really helps cut down on the mess! I love that its waterproof and has long sleeves. Also it is big enough to grow with him! The only thing that I wish were different is the tie in the back, they should have made them snaps instead."
3,sleeves tight,"i bought this due to good reviews, and although nicely constructed and used for many months w/ minimal wear i have a complaint. The sleeves were so tight on my one year old that i had to cut the elastic in order for her to use it w/o marks on her wrists. and NO she is not overweight or even a bit chubby. for that i was really dissapointed, but i kept it because i really needed it..."
5,Tougher to get off!,"I was frustrated with my toddler pulling off the over the head and snap bibs, so I started looking at the alternatives. This sleeved bib is just what I was looking for! No longer is she taking off her bibs at meal time. And it works great at keeping the food messes off of her pretty clothes and keeping her clean after meal times! Worth the price!"
4,Huge help for toddler feeding,"My daughter has recently hit a phase where she's determined to feed herself with a spoon. Often the food doesn't quite make it all the way into her mouth as evidenced by the stains and dried bits of food on her clothes. The Bumpkins sleeved bib has done wonders to capture and collect the food bombs she rains on herself at meals. Her clothes are almost entirely unsoiled afterwards and I spend less time obsessively wiping up spills throughout meal time. I particularly like the pink supernova pattern because even towards the end of a meal when she's covered it with tomato sauce it doesn't advertise it's non-pristine condition. It would be perfect if there was a way for the neck line to be absorbent as less viscous fluids will dribble down her chin onto her shirts, but that would probably require longer drying times between uses (currently I can hand wash it after each meal and it's dry and ready to go in a few hours). Overall a great product."
4,Pleased!,"I didn't register for bibs but got several cloth ones as gifts. I didn't think they'd be useful until we started solids and then I realized they really weren't useful. They had to be washed after every meal & even then they were hard to get clean. Plus, they are so small that they hardly caught the mess a new solid eater makes! These cover our daughter completely & there is plenty of room for growing. They are easy to wipe clean & can be used for several meals before they need to be washed. My only complaint is that the neck is wide to accomodate growing I assume & so I still fight the neck of her clothes getting dirty. For now I put a cloth bib under to cover her neck & will probably use a towel later. I still feel it's worth the money."
2,"Not Lead Free, only lead safe","We ordered this product among all other Bumkins bibs because it was advertised as ""lead free"", but that is not the case since on the actual packaging it states the product is ""lead safe"".Possibly the industry standards are low enough that some consumers are okay with ""just a bit of lead"", but in our case, we do not want any lead in a product used at the dinner table. Returning product and making our own bib out of a used tent.Sorry, Bumkins, your product design in nice and the pattern is fun, but the material with lead is a no,no for us. We don't like sending products back to Amazon and blame the seller or the company.Lead has to go, but not to dinner with us!"
5,Keeps clothes clean,"Little big for my 9month old, but he will grow into it in no time. Super helpful in keeping him clean as he learns to feed himself."
2,Way Too Big,I ordered this in my daughter's size months ago and she still hasn't grown into it. I'm sure it will be great when it finally fits but the sizing is way off.
2,Bummed,"I am pretty bummed. It feels a lot like plastic, is very hard to clean and stains easily. My daughter refuses to wear it. I went back to regular bibs."
4,Great product when you are patient enough to put your child in it,"This is a great product when you are patient enough to put your child in it. It ties int he back rather than velcros and it has those long sleeves you have to get your little one 's arms through.My little one squirms and wriggles and it can be difficult to get her into the long sleeves of the bib when she is determined not to go into it. This is really an issue with us and not the product.Also, while the bib helps protect the sleeves of my daughter's clothes from food, it does nothing to protect from sauces which may dribble down her hand and go right down the sleeve of the bib. Not sure if the elastic on the sleeves is not tight enough or if my daughter is just on the small side for the bib (she is 13 months).It cleans up easily, and I have gotten several compliments on the cute pattern."
5,Wonderful bib!,These bibs are wonderful they are completely waterproof and fit nicely since they have an elastic cuff. My son (12 months) stays completely clean when eating messy things!
3,Happy with bib - wish it had velcro at the back,"It's a good bib, however friends of ours have a similar bib with velcro at the back. Make much more sense as the little guy gets really upset while I try to tie the knot at the back."
4,Great product- could be longer,"I received this for my one year old as a Christmas/1 yr. birthday gift. It works great in completely protecting any of her shirts from messy food or art project stains. I usually give it a quick wash at the sink after meals; it's easy to hand wash or throw it in with a load of clothes, and the bib air dries rapidly. The long sleeves have elastic at the bottom, and it ties in the back. It's too small for my 3 year old, but would probably work well for most 1-2 year olds. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I think the price is too expensive. I also think that for this price it could've been longer in front, and therefore done a better job protecting her pants or dress skirts. The bumkins ""Junior Bib"" is longer, but does not have long sleeves."
5,a must have for a self-feeding baby!,"We LOVE these bibs. Had others that were similar, but these are a softer, more flexible material. Fits our very tall one-year-old well. And it's great they can go in the wash for heavy-duty cleaning. Long-sleeved bibs are so wonderfully handy. We have this and the One Fish, Two Fish style and they are both adorable."
4,A good bib.,I like this bib and really want to love it. The sleeves are great and easy on and off. The material is durable and machine or sink washable. The print is cute. BUT it is too big on the neck for my 13 month old. She is small for her age but not that small that she shouldn't fit a product with age/size range 6-24 months. Because of the slick material there is no way to tighten it past a certain point. So it does a great job of protecting her pants and her sleeves but food gets in between the bib and her chest. So if your child is thin this product is not for you.
4,Bumkins long sleeve bib,"Great bib, but wonder why they don't use velcro at the neck like with their sleeveless bibs? It takes a little bit of effort to get the sleeves on, and by this time, the baby is squirming, and resists the bib being tied- velcro would be so much easier. Also, fabric is a little stiff until washed, but it is wonderful for it's waterproofing! All in all, a great product."
5,Wonderful,"I bought this bib and a Silly Billyz bib for my 15 month old. My daughter currently wears 18-24 month clothes comfortably. This bib fits wonderfully and keeps her neck area and sleeves clean. It rinses clean and dries very quickly.The Silly Billyz bib (size: small) is too big. The opening at the neck is too wide, so food falls on her clothes or she has to wear a separate bib around her neck. The opening of the sleeves is too large, so food gets on her sleeves. Maybe this bib will fit her better when she is older. It also cleans pretty easily, but does not dry as fast because of the furry material on the front."
3,"good, not great","we tried this version as well as the Kushies Waterproof Bib with Sleeves (which we also bought on amazon) and though I loved the print on this version the issues I had were:(1) tie at neck is a pain. Kushies version has velcro and its so much easier(2) elastic at wrists... this was a feature I actually thought I would like better, and while I appreciate the concept (keeps food from falling into the sleeve and clothes from peaking out and getting dirty) because my daughter fights me when I put these (and any bibs) on, the elastic at the sleeve always catches 1 or more fingers and she (and I) get really frustrated.In the end we still use this, especially if the Kushies one is dirty. But when I have both clean I always reach for the easier one to put on her."
1,Extremely small,I ordered two of these bibs for my 2 year old granddaughter. She is on the small side and the bibs were too tight for her. On the package the pic shows children around 3 or 4 years old wearing them. I looked on the web site and no where on the site is there a size option. I would not have ordered them if I had known how small they are. They are truly for infants.
4,Good bib,"I love the bumkins bibs, they are easy to wash, catch most of the dropped food in the pocket, and are cute. This bib is great for keeping our son's shirt and sleeves clean, but it is always a fight to get it on him. Our little guys just doesn't have the patience to put his arms through it, he just wants his food. As a consequence, we don't use it very often."
5,The perfect bib,"I love bumkins bibs. They're easy to clean, dry quickly, and have great coverage. No need to worry about getting their clothes dirty like you do with normal sized bibs. It's also great to carry in the diaper bag. They clean up easily with wipes."
5,Love it!,"I've had this bib for maybe a year, it's awesome. Wipes clean or wash in sink, dries so quickly."
4,Completely Satisfied,"I ordered this bib for my son who was learning to eat solids, and it is genius. It is true to size, has a handy pocket that catches spills, and has saved countless outfits from stains. The only reason that this is not getting 5 stars is because after a few months of use, I noticed that the seam is breaking away from the bib. Not a big deal, still usable, and still very much worth the small investment."
4,Great Bib for a toddler.,Our old bib was soiled and starting to crack so needed a new one. This item lived up to the hype. Would recommend it for an almost two year old. Great value for the money!
4,Best sleeved bib ever,"These are not just great-looking bibs, they're great performing bibs too. Heavy-duty, water/spill proof, sturdy stiching, easy to clean, a nice big pocket, and one of my favorite features is the elastic edges on the sleeves that helps keeps shirt-sleeves clean. We've purchased a few of these Bumkins bibs and have loved every one - they are made to last and look great on top of being very functional. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the price - I do think they could do a little better in that department."
4,Great coverage!,"The size is perfect for my 1 year old daughter. It covers her entire frontal area and works well to protect her clothing from fruit juice dripping down the arms, food and drinks that don't quite make it to her mouth, and even a good smock for her to where during her ""art projects"". Unfortunately it takes her a few minutes to get over the fact that it is on. She's fussy about the sleeves, but otherwise this is a great product!"
4,Nice!,This is a very nice waterproof bib. Lovely color. It would be even better if the fastener on the back was velcro instead of a tie string. It washes very well.
2,sleved bib,"I have purchased several Bumkin waterproof bibs, one of them is the long sleeve one in yellow color. i must admit i purchased yellow robot one because it was cheaper than other colors, but when it arrived i realized that the quality is not the same as the sleeveless blue colored bibs i purchased earlier. material is rough, it feels cheap and almost scratchy. i regret not spending few more $ and purchasing a different color which i am assuming would have been a better quality product as well"
4,Nice bib,This bib fits my daughter very well. I let her to wear it when she eats. It can prevent from getting her clothes dirty. This product is waterproof so it's easy to clean and dry fast. I use wet paper towel to wipe it when it gets dirty. Very nice product. But it is hot when wearing in summer. I will let my daughter wears it in winter. In summer she wears sleeveless bib.
5,The Best,This was the only bib that worked on my toddler. She ripped every other bib off in seconds; it was impossible to keep her clothes covered. This bib covers everything up nicely and the best part is that it ties in the back. Now she cannot just rip it off. Anything with velcro or the hard bibs that snapped or the snap button bibs were nothing for her. This one she just gave up on ripping off. I love it.
3,Pretty but disapointing...,"This bib is very pretty, and I bought it because I liked the fact that the sleeves were tapered unlike other brands such as Kushies (Canadian brand), however I am not please with the not to tie at the top. I find it takes longer to put on, when your child is super hungry every second counts! But mainly the fit is not as tight on her neck as other bibs with velcro and she can therefore stain her collars which is what I am trying to avoid. I have only used it once...;-( Maybe it is because my daughther is too young/small, but she is in 90th percentile for size. I ended up using the Kushies brand bib sleeved bib and just pull her sleeves underneath so that those do not get stained, less work on laundry day. Overall though, these types of bib are a savior for toddlers learning to eat. They are waterproof, easily cleaned after a meal, don't stain too much, dry fast which is a plus."
2,Engulfs a 6 mo old,"According to the description, this bib should fit a 6 mo old. I didn't even try. My son is at the 90% height/weight and the sleeves were probably twice as long as his arms. There was no way I could close the back of it tight enough so that it would fit without his arms slipping inside and out the bottom. This will probably be useful in a year or so, but definitely not useful for a 6 mo old."
3,too big for baby,"this bib is good for covering the sleeves, but it does not cover much of the lap while in a highchair. i bought this for my then 7-month old but it was so big it distracted him from eating. at 9 months, still have to roll the sleeves, and i don't use it much... perhaps will make a good smock later on..."
2,Baby Bjorn is better!,"I bought this bib based on a review comparing the baby Bjorn and this bib. I have a 6 month old and she was way more interested in the bib than the food....WAY too much bib. Yes, it covers the entire body, but it's not like we're doing finger painting. Now maybe I'll use this bib more when she's a messy self feeder but the Baby Bjorn is perfect....not too stiff for her neck and she ignores it. Get that one. Better and cheaper."
1,Complete and utter crap,This book is a waste of time and of the trees sacrificed to its production. It is full of crap. Here's an example: The craters on the Moon were caused by a cosmic battle between the forces of Satan and the armies of the archangel Michael. Not even the Bible says this because not even the Bible's authors knew of the craters. Trust this man and give up a few dozen IQ points.
3,Read other Morris,"This is a great little book to read on Creation. This is one author you can trust when it comes to the subject. Treat this little book more as a summary, however, of certain issues. Don't just rely on this book. I suggest reading the ""Genesis Record"" or ""The Genesis Flood"" for further details. As a quick little guide, its good for a new reader or an introduction. The earth and all that is in it is certainly remarkable, but even more remarkable is the Creator that is shown through Creation.""But ask the animals, and they will teach you, or the birds of the air, and they will tell you; or speak to the earth, and it will teach you, or let the fish of the sea inform you. Which of all these does not know that the hand of the LORD has done this? In his hand is the life of every creature and the breath of all mankind."" Job 12:7-10"
3,Different perspective,"I thought Ms. Taylor's choice to continue the story from Vivienne's point of view was a great idea. It gives the reader more background information on another of her intriguing characters and continues (in Part 2) to tell what becomes of the future of the cadre. In all, it was a good, light read; however, I felt that most of the book didn't have much plot. And I like books with more ""meat"". This story just didn't have enough for me (when compared with her others). There was more about Vivienne's past than there was actual storyline, but don't get me wrong. It was certainly entertaining to see her past come to life so vividly. So my feelings about this book...? I will recommend it to Taylor's ""vampire legacy"" fans. As for others? Check it out at your local library when it becomes available."
3,Fluff,"Karen Taylor's vampires are a pretty tame lot, all in all. They need blood but generally take only a pint or so. They seem to rarely kill their victims and aside from having to avoid daylight and not aging, lead pretty normal lives. This is not a bad book. It's well-written and the lead character, Vivienne Courbet, is beautiful, spunky and impulsive (almost, but not quite, to the point of being stupid). The plot is thin. We follow Vivienne from her work (which she apparently loves) as a high priced prostitute in 18th Century Paris, to her conversion by Max, through the French Revolution, to modern day New York. Not a lot of surprises in this one. The villain is pretty obvious, the resolution pat. Moderately entertaining fluff, but I've read worse."
3,Nice storytelling,"Karen Taylor does a great job at storytelling in the Vampire Vivienne. Although Vivienne is often portrayed as young and innocent and not very powerful for what we know of Vampires, it's hard not to like her and see her get what she wants.The books takes place in two parts, the early 1700's in Paris and in modern times in the United States. It's an easy book to read and for the most part stays on the surface. The one criticism I'd have is that the ending is too abrupt. It's a good and surprising ending, but it comes about to quickly and is over before you know it.All in all, I enjoyed it very much and it keeps your interest up throughout."
2,Just plain stupid,"Now don't get me wrong, this book would've been great if it focused on a plot of some sort rather than the half-autobiography, half-totalcrap thing it did. Part one of the book is pretty good. I was getting into it even. Then it just brings you to present day and there's this wannabe terrorist group out to get them all. woopee. Taylor doesn't pay attention to detail very well i've noticed. Things just kinda happen randomly. Now, it might've been better if I had actually read the previous books in the series, but we'll never know now because I have no desire to read anything by Taylor again. Trust me, save your money."
3,"The music is very good, but I'm not a fan of this voice","I know that Cecilia Bartoli has a great name for herself in the world of opera, but I keep coming back to this CD to gain a better appreciation/understanding of a portion of the music of Antonio Salieri. The problem with continuing to come back to this album is a personal dilsike for Ms. Bartoli's voice. For that reason, I have a tough time focusing on the music. I've recently spent time listening to other singers peforming arias of Salieri's music and came back to this album for comparative purposes. This recent foray only cemented that I personally am not a fan of this voice. I would like to see more performers perform Salieri, not to see him gain popularity (opera likely never will be ""popular"" again), but to have better variety in the recorded catalogue."
1,Sound Quality?,"Has anyone been bothered by the poor sound quality of this disc? The orchestra is thin, Baroli's voice harsh, and the ambiance constricted? It sounds almost like some dolby or noise reduction system distortion is happening. Could this have anything to do with the superaudio format being played on a non sacd system?And I am a fan of Bartoli and appreciate Salieri. That's not the problem."
2,Nice Music........,"This was a cool album, but why the heck does she always have to riff and raff when she sings notes???? Sounds like vocal exercises that she's doing. And her coloratura is more laboured and withheld then I've ever heard her before. I suggest that she shouldn't try to sound like ""A little girl trying on mommy's shoes"". She needs to stick with songs that are in the Mezzo range, and should't venture out and sing anything higher than the Soprano High B or High C. She could never be Kathleen Battle (despite her reputations and her diva-acting attitude), or Edita Gruberova."
4,What a revival!,"Great revival of works, great singing...but I only have one word to say...FREAK! Cecilia Bartoli can sometimes get into her freakish phase when singing some pieces, and it is that aspect of hers which turns me off. She can sometimes sing with a breathy tone for expressiveness' reason, but that was something the greatest opera singer and singing actress the world has ever seen (Maria Callas) never did. But overall, it is still a very good album. I just hope that she wouldn't get into her cutesy mode too often, as her voice really freaks me out at times."
2,"sorry, but the voice is ugly","The first aria on this disk is absolutely horrible in execution and painful on the ear. Just listen to the music sample for yourself and tell me if you want to spend money on this disc. CB's cloying mannerisms coupled with her ""miss piggy-esque"" vocal pyrotechnics barely conceal the obvious fact that her voice is thin, strained at the top, and steely to the point that that it has become ugly. Buy her earlier discs to discover the marvel that she once was."
5,Best Cd eva!,Well me and my homeboys wre straight tripping until i was like lets go listen to some music.There all like aight.So we listen to the radio and we here a song off this cd were like this is cool.So we turn up the bass and and turn the hydraulics on we drive away in are pimp mobile.(The pimp mobile was a 1969 P.O.S).We pull up to some old guy were like whats up homie g hes says nuttin much dawg. Well this song was awsome too we turn up the base. It turns out it was our P.O.S breaking down. So we buy some toilet paper and left the 2 12 packs it in the bag we put in as our engine and battery and this P.O.S. sounded just like a hemi.
3,BE CAREFUL CECILIA!,"I was shocked listening to Bartoli's new Salieri CD. Yes, the music is all unfamiliar and Madame B and company deserve praise for resurrecting these interesting arias. Nonetheless, I think something must be said about her increasingly controversial vocalism, the violent attacks and glottals at both extremes of the range, and the extremely exaggerated dramatics - either inaudible whispering or ear-splitting shrieking. Oh, yes, it's so dramatic and all. Does she not realize just as much meaning can be put into the subtle coloring of words and phrasing without such a vocal circus? What has happened to this wonderfully warm instrument? She is in grave danger of being the first of the so-called new generation of classical singers to wreck her voice, and NOT from singing the wrong repertoire (as was the case of so many singers of the past). Bartoli may be the first who is singing the right repertoire WRONG."
5,Was just what I wanted and in better condition than I expected!,"My kids love the stories! Takes me back to my childhood, we use to have these same bedtime stories when we were kids"
5,One of the best CDs ever,"I really enjoyed listening to this CD. I would put the CD on and listen to the whole CD over and over again. You know how you buy a CD and you only listen to a few songs that you like. Well You don't have to skip through this CD, cuz it's ALL GOOD!"
3,Not bad...but,"If you are lloking for a tense, spine tingling story of Nazi espionage duting WWII this isn't your book. If you are looking for a fact based, fast paced, historcal recounting of a failed Nazi attempt to create havoc in the U.S., then this is it. A great commentary of what happens when a government at war picks the wrong people as operatives, then turns them loose with a bunch of money and no supervision. The ""operatives"" act, at times, as ketstone cops. Nicely written and certanly an event worth retelling....just not thrilling ""on the edge of your seat"" reading."
3,Nazi raid on America,"Starts off with great interest, but drags later. A good read, though. Believable characters and plot. Scary to think something like this can happen on our coastline."
2,Needs Improvement,"Maybe future editions will be better.For now, choice of topic presentation, examples, and exercises leave a lot to be desired."
1,Terrible,This book is terrible. Very lazy solutions to problems. Not clear whatsoever.Also the solutions manual has no order to it as it only has solutions to problems it feels like solving.For instance section 5.2: starts at 12. Traditionally solutions manuals are either all odd or all even problems.Of course our math professor doesn't like it either so doing the problems in the back of each chapter was generally useless to us.
1,Another poor book from a poor publisher,"I have used Thomas course learning books for years in classes at two colleges and they are horrible. This book is no exception from the rest. Solutions to answer Keys are incorrect at times, explinations are vague, the overal layout is lacking... If you are a teacher choosing a book for a course, I beg that you choose prentice hall (or any other publisher for that matter) instead of this one."
2,I expected better,"Have fun trying to figure out why you didn't get the right answer to the selected exercises. Its probably because there are so many errors in the solutions! I spent hours trying to figure out why I wasn't getting the right answer. Try the answer to 6.2 #11b. I don't even know what problem they are talking about here on page A-46. How about 6.2 #14? If it says ""a license plate has four letters and 3 numbers,"" then how do they end up with 6 total slots for the multiplication rule instead of 7? There are plenty more issues with the book, but why bother writing about it?Hey Dr Epp, lets do a little more PROOFREADING before you ask us to buy your sloppy first draft for $150."
1,Not a good maths book,"This book is too wordy, i hate that quality in a math text, i hate it when the author tries to overexplain things and ends up complicating matters and boring the reader. The textbooks size could be reduced to half if all the useless junk is taken out of the book."
5,Fantastic CD,"This set of recordings is truly inspired. It is perhaps my wife's and my favorite ""romantic evening"" CD to get out. Dennis Solee seems to have spent a lot of time with each of these songs, figuring out what he felt in them, and how he wanted to play with the melody - and it comes through.I have one of his other CDs. The playing in it is obviously good but it doesn't move me the way this one does."
2,low quality tape,The tape appeared to be in excellent condition until I played! The quality of the video resolution was poor! I consider it to be watchable but just barely!
4,Lotus matures,"On TSOWT, Lotus expandes their style and proves to be a multidimensional, eclectic band. As with any musical experimentation, this first outing may be a surprise to fans of their previous releases and live performances. For the majority of the album, Lotus moves away from the housey beats and guitar-based melodies of Nomad and Germination. At its best, songs such as 'Blue Giant' and 'Bubonic tonic' are excellent soundscapes with patented Lotus groove that take you into a trancendent state. There are some songs, including 'When H binds to O' and 'Drunken Giraffe without as clear a melodic message and more of a jazz feel than the quentiessential Lotus song. Although these are interesting, worthwhile songs they are also a large departure from the dance-infused live shows and releases. Perhaps we can take this as a sign that Lotus will continue to keep us on our toes."
3,Informed Consumer,"Having worked in the memory business, J.Chang is right that Kingston is a large company, but they are the largest memory MODULE maker in the world, mostly for DRAM product. Eugene's comment regarding them being a buyer of chip product is right, and he's also correct from what I've seen in return rates for Kingston, Sandisk, Lexar, etc. in that there are more defects because Kingston does not product their own chips like Sandisk. They only package the product as well as the controller chip (which also they do not make). Samsung, who Kingston purchases from, does not sell cards in the US They only package the product.Personally, as a consumer, I bought Kingston and Sandisk, and found the data transfer rate to be faster on the Sandisk. I don't dare want to lose a picture from a potential defect, even though the chances of this is low for either product. I'll go with Sandisk from now on."
5,Kingston 256 SD Card,"I have owned this card for almost a year. I purchased it to use in my Nikon 5600 digital camera. They work great together. The card holds more pictures than I'm ever likely to take at one time. I insert the card into my computer & transfer the pictures. It has never been corrupted or lost data. Have been very satisfied. When I first got it I did as someone recommended that I do, I used it till the card was completely full to test it for problems, and it had none. Very satisfied."
5,Can't beat the price,The cost plus shipping still beats the sale priceof a similar item at Walmart. Works fine.
3,OK,"I got this bag because it matched the stroller and car seat. It is a good bag in that it has a lot of extras (changing pad, dirty clothes bag, cooler compartment, and lots of pockets) and a lot of room. The only thing I don't like about it is that it is big. Too big to easily fit in the basket of the matching stroller. I wish they made a smaller version that fits into the stroller. Though I would still buy this one to have for when I need the extra space."
4,I am a Windsor Fan!,"I bought this bag b/c I have ALL the other pieces with the Windsor print. The bag is durable. I am able to fit it under my Windsor stroller even though I prefer to hang it on the handles instead for easy access. The bag has a lot of compartments to make it easier to find your little items. The additional accessories was a great bonus, but it does make the bag a little heavier.The only thing is that I wish there were bottle holders on the outside of the bag so we could have more room on the inside.I would recommend this bag to any mom.I also bought the Eddie Bauer Backpack which was of no use to me. It's so narrow and deep that all the items fall to the bottom, like a big purse, you can fit a lot of stuff but they are all hard to get to.GRACO WINDSOR BAG WAS BETTER THEN THE EDDIE BAUER BACKPACK!"
3,Song List (albeit incomplete),"[...]Here is the list of songs included in the ""uninterupted"" concert (Only 12 of 20 songs on the CDs) in order of appearance: Master and Servant, Pimpf, Behind the Wheel, Strangelove (missing the middle verse - ouch), Blaspemous Rumours, Stripped, Somebody, Black Celebration (end faded out), Pleasure Little Treasure (beginning faded in), Just Can't get Enough (end faded out), Everything Counts (beginning faded in), and Never Let Me Down Again (beginning quickly faded in). The total play time not including credits is 51:36.My expectations were set artificially high and unfortunately not met. The rest of the reviews cover everything else you need to know."
5,Depeche Mode at it's best!,"This is the greatest musical documentary of all time. Being a fan for two decades now, no other performance can top 101. Though the concert was not shown to it's whole entirety, let's face it, if digital recording is available at those times, we will not crave for more. For me, this movie has shown Depeche Mode at their best and how cool the 80's era is. A must have to all music collectors of different music genres."
5,J.STEDMAN READ THIS,Faded in faded out what are you talking about?you should appreciate if you are a real DM fan that there`s a Dvdfor their concerts. are you a producer or a fan?take care and enjoy.
5,I enjoyed the film.,"I was one of the few people who saw this movie who was not originally a die hard Depeche Mode fan. Actually the girl I was watching it said that it may change my taste of music forever. It did, you can tell by my email adress"
4,The madness that explained the madness that followed,"A multi-faceted video that leads to Depeche Mode's famous Rose Bowl concert, which was and will probably remain the emotional peak of the lives of Gahan, Fletcher, Gore, and Wilder. Surrounded by tens of thousands of people, Dave led them all in a singalong. Surrounded by this adulation and unconditional acceptance, it's no wonder that Depeche Mode decided to break out of the palace and try something new. The pressures led to a band defection, a nervous breakdown, and a suicide attempt. Valuable historical record of what was."
3,"A good DVD, but falls short compared to other DM releases","101 is in my opinon, an overrated DM release. I was somewhat dissapointed when i bought it. The DVD contains some classic live songs (shake the disease, stripped) but the overall quality of the live concert and the way the concert is shot is average at best. Most songs are only about 1/2 the live performance, and the other half is just weird filler such as random people dancing or talking.Personally, i would have enjoyed a ""One night in paris"" style DVD much more, but this is an ok buy just to see some of the classic songs you've listened to over and over on the 101 double disk set."
1,Thought this was supposed to be new?,"Watch looked really nice, but upon inspection there was a huge chunk missing from the back of the face of the face where you would change the battery. No biggie if its for yourself but my girlfriend did not appreciate it, so it was sent back. Im not sure why Amazon would send me something already damaged, but this is the 2nd time it has happened so Im starting to wonder about the quality of their products."
4,Inclusive education,"I bought this book to use for my university dissertation on inclusive education. I found that it was an interesting and informative book and I ended up reading it just for the joy of it. She is perceptive about special needs and looks at special needs and inclusive eduaction from a novel angle. She aslo sheds insight on friendship as a whole by using her case studies of special needs and mainstream children.A good book, highly recommended!"
4,works great with a fuji s3000,"This kit is a great addition to an older Fuji S3000. I have used all of the lenses, (tele, wide, macro) and all work as promised. The wide angle worked great on a recent trip to Colorado. The cleaning kit included also came in handy. If you have an older Fuji and want an inexpensive way to trick it out a little, try this kit."
5,Bomach,"Awesome ! I couldn't be more pleased with the quality of the merchandise ,this is a top deal ,I carefully inspected everything in this kit and all things were of better quality than I expected ! This wasa great deal at regular price ,let alone at the discount! I will be dealing with this companyfor a lot more of my photograhy needs !"
3,Variable Quality Kit,"Mixed bag. The close-up and wide-angle lens sets were the best items. The accessories were OK to good. the bendy little desk-top tripod is marginal as is the cleaning kit. The big tripod made a good gift for my girlfriend, but was too short for me (I'm 6'2""). The camera bag was good for my miscellaneous stuff. The filter kit is OK. A spot on the ND filter doesn't clean off. The UV and polarizers are good. Probably could have spent about the same money on fewer things and selectively bought better quality filters."
5,B movie classic,"I was a young girl when I first saw this movie on television. My mother called it, ""Raw!"" I knew what that meant, but not really. But, I never forgot the movie or the title. I'd been looking for Parrish for years before Amazon had it - I bought it for my library. It was bigger than I remembered, not smaller. And, yes, it was raw, the way movies used to be, using vivid contrast between men and women. A hot romance set in tobacco country. Beautifully photographed."
5,Parrish,"This is not so much a review of the movie but a rather a short summary of how it has fitted into my life. I first saw Parrish 43yrs ago when I was 16yrs old and feel that it hasn't lost it's intensity. I believe it describes the social history of that time very well and think it was one of the best movies from the 1960's era; and Troy Donahue was such a gorgeous hunk. From that time I have been wanting to watch it again and for all those years I have inquired about it in every Video/DVD store I came across. The movie made such an impression on me at the time 15yrs later I named my daughter Paige after the young girl in the movie.Thank you Amazon for allowing me to see it once more as it is not available for sale in Australia, however I believe it has been shown on cable TV very occasionally.Thoroughly enjoyed it once again after a long wait!"
3,Parrish,"This is an old classic film with Troy Donahue. Typical old south story of dominance in the tobacco industry. Some good acting by movie stars that are no longer with us. Although it was rather ""spendy"" I wanted it for a gift to a friend and he was delighted to receive. I would purchase it again."
2,Piece 'o junk - your money down the drain,"Router setup was fairly easy and it worked like a charm for the first 2-3 months. Then, I began having intermittent wireless connectivity issues (connection would drop or worse, I couldn't connect at all). Issue was definitely with the router.Netgear support (phone and e-mail) was pathetic at best (and costly if you are out of the first 90 days). Their solutions never worked and they never offered to replace the router.In the end, this was a complete waste of money. I decided to purchase the Belkin Pre-N router, which has worked like a charm and has incredible range."
2,Poor performance and reliability,Setup was easy. Works without problems with my Powerbook and desktop PC with 64 bit WEP encryption enabled. However the router sometimes freezes and keeps rebooting itself. I loose connection and have to power down the router and then power it up to make it stable.Also performance is not good. If I connect my 3Mbps Comcast Motorola SurfBoard cable modem directly to my PC I get about 2.2-2.8 Mbps from Speakeasy test. Once I connect it thru the router (wired 100Mbps LAN connection ) I get down to mostly 1.8-2.2 Mbps and sometimes upto 2.5Mbps max. The wireless conection with my Powerbooks 802.11b is worse as i can get about 1.5-1.9 mbps !Significant drop in bandwidth I will think.Avoid this cheap router and go with Linksys instead.
2,"Did not like this product, will use Linksys next time","I bought a Netgear rp614 awhile back to upgrade from my old Siemans router. I was very impressed with the ease of the routers administration and all, and would rate that router a 4.5/5.0 or 5.0/5.0 it's a damn good router all around, network transfers, stability and gaming.However, this wireless router I bought to conjoin with my old network and server as a WAP was horrible. It was very unstable and had several bugs working as a WAP which it is capable of doing, but very poorly. I highly recommend to buy a Linksys over the Netgear here, even though Linksys routers are a bit inferior wired for gaming, their wireless ones far exceed Netgear."
4,EXCELENTE PRODUCTO (de ARGENTINA),"Soy de ARgentina, mis Tios se acaban de mudar de USA para aca, se trajeron uno de estos, una laptop WIFI, la instalacion fue increiblemente rapida, lo instale, la opciones son muy faciles, enseguida la laptop lo detecto y estoy navegando con 802.11g, hay que leer un poco el manual, como cualquier producto, y a parte el tema de la arquitura de redes hay que leer un poco tambien"
2,Good router but forget about rebate,Router's performance is acceptable. Signal strengh subsides significantly (from excellent to low) within small distance (30 ft) but probably because of the walls etc.Connection speed is adequate. Configuration is excellent.Firewall features/security configuration is not abundant but OK and working quite stable. Once the router (in two months after the router was configured) lost its settings and reconfiguration was required (it takes 2 minutes).Two stars is because Netgear's customer service is BAD and unfriendly. ...
2,Leaves something to be desired,This model of the Netgear WGR614 Wireless-G Router disconnects the internet signal whenever the digital phone is in use. Changing the cbannel on the phone does not prevent the loss of signal.
5,Excellent product and service,"Product arrived promptly, was easy to install, and worked perfectly after the install and subsequently until the current time. An excellent transaction."
1,Worked for a day,"Had a really bad experience with this product. Clear cut instructions should be provided with router, not just a CD and warranty card. Inserted CD and followed the basic setup verbatim and still had issues. Spent three hours with customer service. Finally got it going after several resets, power cycles, etc. Things were finally looking up until the next morning. Again, could not get on internet. I went through all the steps the same as the day before with no avail. Returned router and bought different brand. Different brand router worked immediately with no complications. I have used Netgear routers for several years and this experience has left me disappointed. All and all, bad technical support and bad product."
5,"So far, so good","I recently received this router as a gift from a friend - a computer geek :-). Since I am not very savvy when it comes to the ""tech"" part of things, I have come to rely on him for recommendations and help. Of course, he helped me get things working. It helped, I believe, that I have a Mac (He also totally sold me on Macs, too - amazing how much more friendly they are to work with than PCs). I probably could have figured out how to get it working on my own, but was glad that I didn't have to. What I can say, though, is that it is AWESOME! I haven't any significant difficulties. Once in a while I will lose the internet connection for a heartbeat on my laptop. However, it is a minor inconvenience, and now I can even work outside. I also love the fact that I am not tied down to my computer any more, and am able to hear the programs and music that are on itunes in other parts of my home, thanks to this router and Airport Express (and, of course, my friend!)"
1,Worst product I have ever purchased,I rarely submit reviews but I found this product so bad I felt I should warn potential purchasers. It worked only about 10% of the time. Sometimes my laptop would connect to the internet and/or share files but most of the time it would not. Sometimes it never worked from the moment the laptop was turned on. Sometimes it did work for a few minutes then it would stop. This is nothing but a piece of junk. I replaced it with a Belkin and the Belkin works flawlessly.
1,Umm I think it's made of poop.,"Worked ok for a few weeks. Now it's impossible to get it working. It's a massively overcomplicated procedure to try to get this piece of excrement connected the right way. Even when you do everything right, it still doesn't work."
1,Netgear and satellite,If there was less then 1 star is what I would give it..I could not get it to work on my computer because of my satellite...
4,Netgear Review,"I had a terrible router before, and asked a few college friends what they recommended. It looks like this one had lasted them for years. Just the product I am looking for!"
1,Prepare to Re-start your router,"Got this a year ago, and we have had to restart it every other day. Now, after reading other reviews, it seems like it is a common experience. The old saying you get what you pay for is true here. Save your money, and get an Airport Extreme from Apple."
4,"Good product, great price.","Very easy to use and set up. A word to the wise, read the instructions. (Being an American male, this is a difficult concept for me, as in we don't need no stinking instructions.)This unit has good range in my ranch style home, and it looks great to boot. Two weeks ago, I knew nothing about about wireless routers. Now I can navigate the internet wirelessly from anywhere in my home. Technology is a beautiful thing."
4,"Nothing flashy, but works","Works like a charm. 2.4ghz is iffy, with the phones.. But works with my older PDA and the other PC's over the wireless very well."
4,"Great Product, Exceeded my expectations!","This product was great, I live in a two story brick building and this gives pretty fast connections to everyone in the house! It also looks pretty good and protects the internet information through encription. the only drawback is that it sometimes needs to be unplugged and replugged to reset its sync with the main modem. Any problem however is easily solved with the friendy support staff the user can call."
4,works good,this has worked out fine for me. i had a hard time figuring out how to make it work. i really bought this because it is white. and looks nice. haha. i'm giving it 4 stars just because it was hard for me to set up
1,Item was no good,This router was not working when i received it. When i called Net Gear to see if they could help me set it up they told me it would cost $40 to configure it. Totally disappointed. TWO THUMBS DOWN!!!!
1,Harward issues with this router are not a myth,I have had the same problems that many have detailed in the reviews here. I got a year plus of service out of the router before the problems started.
2,pretty much crap,constant drop outs and just a flimsy service overall. thought at first it seemed alright - but after it kinda retires itself.
1,Horrid customer service,"Yes, this was easy to install, but if you have a problem with the product more than 90 days after purchase, forget about getting help. I called for technical support, was advised to disconnect some wires, then told that in order to hear the rest of the instructions I would need to pay either $39.99 for one-time support or a larger sum for an extended warranty. I asked to speak with a supervisor and was disconnected. I called again and was told I could get free online support, but that, alas, is also only within 90 days of product purchase. I do not recommend any Netgear product."
1,Dont waste your money.,My previous router went out and a bought this cheap one to use until my ISP started making it mandatory to use there routers here in the next month or so. I have had this router about 2 months and it is crap. As others have said it randomly drops connections. At first it was everyone once in a while. the last few days it has been every few minutes at times. Now i will have to replace this modem again. If you dont have the option to get a modem from your ISP spend the money and buy a good one. These cheap ones arent worth the headache.
3,Adequate wireless router for Home use,"I have the version 9 and have used it since at least 2009. I have only had to reset it twice in 3 years, which beats my old router at once a month.It comes with a stand, power supply and antenna. The back offers tie in to 4 LAN lines. Dimensions are around 7 inches (Plus antenna), 6 inches (Deep + cables) 1 inch. With base 7 1/2 by 7 1/2 by 2.Without structural interference range is around 100 ft, with structure around 50 ft.The front panel has lights that recognize wireless and which LAN lines are being used. Also has power and Internet connection lights.Pro:Has been very reliableSet up and security settings are simpleCon:Range is short in HouseSpeed seems to be limited"
3,Don't upgrade the firmware!!!!,"I've had the WGR614 since it came out. It has proven to be an ok router, especially when I compare it to the issues I had with the comparable Linksys and D-Link products that I had before. However, after upgrading to the latest firmware, to comply with the 802.11g standard, the router crapped out.We use three wireless components at the house, and none of them could hold a signal once I installed the new firmware. It was so bad, I thought it was something that had to do with my wireless cards.Not so. I didn't even bother calling the inept service department. I just downgraded the firmware and was able to get the router back to the performance it had before.I just ordered the business model (uglier, but hopefully a better product). I will report on that one once it is installed."
1,bad DHCP server and wireless,"It often ignores the address reservations you set up in LAN IP setup, giving out the same IP to different MAC addresses. This happens once or twice a week in a network with about 10 machines/devices connected to the network.It also about once a week will stop accepting wireless connections and has to be rebooted."
4,router for the ages,"dont call NETGEAR for tech support, its over -priced and not worth it, instead, look it up on thier forums and instructions for help on install. trust someone who has been thru this."
1,Cannot protect from virus or it has virus by itself,"I noticed anonymous call from router is going to site [...]... from this machine. It means router has in built virus,that can steal information from users. It is noticed that the virus will not harm working of the router by itself,but it can steal information from traffic from your computers."
2,"Useable, poor software, no software support for MAC","It's hard to believe that's its 2007 and they would make router software without support for MAC. Also, there is no download, the software runs from the CD, which means you have to load the CD when you want to inquire, run help, etc.They also charge for customer service after three months!!! The cost is $69! Almost twice the cost of the router. I owned a Linksys before buying this router and have nothing but praise for Linksys hardware and support."
5,"Solid router, weak Wi-Fi","This router was easy to setup and upgrade. It is important to upgrade the firmware as soon as you get it up and running. This eliminated some initial flakyness. I also had to reboot my cable modem AND the router to initially get the router to correctly resolve DNS on Comcast for some reason. No trouble since.The Wi-Fi signal is a little on the weak-side. I had no trouble with placement with my Actiontec DSL router from Qwest. This guy consistently dropped signal in the same location as the Actiontec. Since Wi-fi placement is more of an art than science, I move, elevated the router and now it doesn't drop. On the plus side I have NOT rebooted this router as much as the Actiontec.This is a solid router at a good price."
1,DONT BUY!,"i bought this router hoping to get signal range improvement overmy current belkin 54g router. i tested the router and had no improvement at all. in fact ,this router in no way has 1000% better coverage as marketed by netgear than my regular g router.trust me this is not even close to being true. my house is about 3000 sq ft.,so large but not enormous.there appears to be firmware problems as well. if you have a mixed b and g devices environment like i so (old laptops and g wireless media servers) the performance is awful . very slow. my son tried to do some gaming off of his laptop and it would freeze.cnet did some tests in a mixed b anf g environment and performance dropped greatly compared to an all g environment.so be warned if you have a mixed group like i do.this is not the router for you.wait for a good n router"
1,a big mistake,"This thing loses connectivity almost every day. Your PC tells you no signal. The only solution is to reboot the router, which means cycling the power. With no switch on the unit you have to disconnect and reconnect the power line. Ugh!"
1,"Terrible product, worse customer service","This product lasted for about a month before one of the four ports failed and had to be returned to the company. In the short period of time that I owned it, it worked very poorly. Although the setup was easy, the range was poor with a useful range of less than thirty feet. I spent several hours on technical support with less-than-knowlegeable people trying to resolve the problem of poor range and apparent interference. After exchanging the product for a new one (at the recommendation of tech support people), I had the same problem. A few weeks later, one of the ports failed and technical support directed me to return the product to Netgear. I returned it three months ago and have not received the unit back nor have I heard a word from the company. This is a bad product from a company with poor customer service."
3,Troublesome,"I bought this router to use with a Lynksys PC adapter to share DSL access between 2 computers in my apartment. The router sent an excellent wireless signal to the adapter in the next room. And the firewall and encryption features are excellent (64 or 128-bit encryption). But the MTU setting on the router was a problem. I worked with the Netgear technical service people on their toll-free hotline but we were never able to locate the correct MTU to browse certain sites on the internet. The wrong setting is particularly problematic for sites like Yahoo!, AOL, and MSN Hotmail. (Netgear routers have a default setting of 1500.)The service person said that I needed to download an update and install it on the router. Then I would have to manually re-enter all of the configuration settings on the router's set-up web-page. I thought that was too much trouble so I opted to just return it in favor of another brand."
3,"good router, short life","it's a good router if you're not planning to open up ports for gaming or downloading because it is almost impossible to do it. you would need a static IP address to do so, unlike linksys and d-link. other than that, everything works like a charm. setted up file sharing, printer sharing and MAC address security flawlessly with no dropped connections for 1 year. after a year of usage, the wireless connections drop about once every 2 weeks. once every 2 weeks is not a big deal, but it's probably the sign of aging in 1 year??"
2,Would not recommend,"The router was simple enough to set up and use, and the feature set is attractive. I purchased this for my parents' home, in which they have 2 PCs and a Playstation 2. Wireless features work very well around the two story house. The problem lies in attempting to one of the PS2 games. After almost exactly 20 minutes online, the PS2 is disconnected by the router. This is a very odd issue."
3,"Doesn't work with VPN, poor tech support","Bought it, set it up (not too hard, not too easy), worked great with Internet ... but Outlook did not work across my company's Nortel VPN. Contacted tech support; they only do email back and forth. I quickly tried suggestions and responded. It's been 2-days and no response yet."
1,Overheats if you use more than 2 ports,"This product has a big problem with overheating. I solved it for a while by switching out the power supply for a lower voltage (I know, it surprised me that this worked too). At any rate, it worked great for the first 90 days or so, but it's not a good long term investment."
2,Get Something Else!,"Purchased what seemed like a good wireless router, but eventually the performance dropped, pages timed-out etc. I scoured the internet, but found that my particular model, the v4, has persistent problems, and neither the company nor anyone else had a fix for it. Eventually I replaced it with a Linksys WRT54GS. Not a problem since."
2,For once the bad reviews were right.,"The product is fairly easy to install, though the interface is a little quirky. Wireless option is turned off by default. Starting it isn't as simple as clicking a button. The button is there but you can't click it. I had to go through the awful ""Smart"" Wizard to get it to enable the Wireless capability.Once setup, I was pleased to find out that my company VPN was able to connect. The problem is the range. I have an old Belkin 802.11 B WAP and the range is better with that than this router/WAP combo. I moved my laptop out of the office where it's located and the strength drops to almost half while when I test it with my old WAP, the strength barely flickers. I move it to the next floor and I lose all connectivity while I still have about 75% strength connecting to the old WAP."
1,USELESS AND CRAPY PRODUCT-DO NOT BUY,"Netgear product really sucks. Do not buy any products form NEtgear. There are thousands of users of this product and all compalins about dropping network connections. And to top that off, they charge shipping to replace the router. I would never buy a product from Netgear again. The products are unreliable and really crappy."
1,Their products have no warranty.,"Contrary to their claims, their products have no warranty at all (unless you pay for it). I have a 2 year old gateway router that had a 5 year warranty that stopped working one day so I called their tech support. The tech support person told me that since the product is over 90 days old and they do not manufacture it anymore, then I would have to contact their pay tech support line to get an RMA. If they are able to fix the problem over the phone line, then they will charge me, otherwise they will offer me an RMA number for a return. So basically you have to pay to use their warranty. A friend who is a lawyer is currently handling this situation."
2,Constantly resetting this router,"There is something wrong with the DHCP server on this router. Even after upgrading to the latest firmware, the DHCP server constantly drops the IPs from my computers. I can be in the middle of surfing, playing games over the net or even mid-download, the DHCP server will attempt to renew and drop the internet connection. The LAN will still be operational, but the internet will suddenly be inacccessible. The support page only offers ""reset everything..."" which is ludicrous. A person should not have to constantly return to the router to reset it manually. I end up resetting the router 3-4 times a day.I had a Linksys 802.11b router and gave it away to my brother when I upgraded to G. I seriously regret that now. This Netgear is the most finicky/exasperating router I have ever encountered. I will never buy from Netgear again, and will now spend more money for a new Linksys g rouiter."
1,Netgear support is horrible,"I purchased a Netgear WGR614 wireless router 6 months ago and it failed a couple of weeks ago. The unit is locked up and brain dead. This is the second Netgear wireless router I've had that has done this. Netgear will not replace it on warranty unless you talk to tech support on the phone. The catch is, it is damn near impossible (as far as I can tell) to get through. So their 3-year warranty isn't worth crap. Also, the range on this unit, when it was working, was very poor."
2,"No customer serivice, you need to pay","I have used for several months, and it doesn't support XP service pack2. Download driver didn't work. You have to pay for the tech support. I won't buy NETGEAR product again."
2,Not for internet games,"I bought one and hated it! When playing Starcraft over the internet (multiplayer game) it will have high latency, making a terrible game lag. I contacted netgear support several times and tried every configuration they suggested, it did not work. In the end, I had to return it. It seems that the way it was built can't handle bursts of small packages well. It will probably work well for home network without any high demands (as any other router would, as a matter of fact)."
1,Bad product- Nigtmare Technical Support,"WGR614 Router comes in multiple versions, some of which have known problems with many DSL routers. Of course, you won't learn this until you spend 8 hours with Netgear level 1 technical support (outsourced to india). Only after hours of this torture, did they bump me up to level 2 support where after a couple more hours they finally confirmed the device had this known problem. They promised to send me a more reliable version within 5-7 days. Three weeks later, it never arrived & I never heard a word from them, no email, no confirmation, nothing. I gave them one last chance & tried to call back the level 2 support line ... can't... their line is out of order the past couple evenings.Conclusion: DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT unless you're a masochist and need to be punished and humiliated."
2,Worked for a few months....,I would encourage you to visit the netgear website and browse their forums for posts on the wgr614 and the 624. There's got to be thousands of posts dealing with essentially the same issue; a lack of wireless connection stability. I'd rather have my old 802.11b linksys WAP....that thing has been running without a problem in my parent's house for 2-3 years. Oh well. Does anyone here want a netgear? They're so cheap now I can't even sell it. All you have to do is cover shipping....
1,Very poor quality,"I had problems with this router the moment I got it home. I had to use the 90-day free customer service line 5 times in the first 3 months of having the router. Then on the fourth month, the router died for no apparent reason. Then I had to pay to send the router back to Netgear to get a replacement. I will never purchase another Netgear product."
2,Just would not hold a signal,"I am (was) a big Netgear Fan, until this router. My previous Netgear Router (MR314) worked great, but I wanted to upgrade to the ""G"" Speed throughtout my house. After buying two (2) of the WGR614's (recommended by Netgear)and spending countless hours on hold with Technical Support(India), this Router could never hold a signal and every few hours to every few days needed to be re-set. Set-up was very easy on the Netgear, but having to buy 2 units and both not working, I changed to the Linksys WRT54G and never have had a dropped signal yet. Speed is great, set-up was a breeze and they have US Technical support. Sorry Netgear."
4,Netgear WGR614 802.11g Wireless Router,"Easy to set up and use. However, occasionally, there are problems when 2 or more computers are connected to this wirelessly. A message may come up while surfing saying ""Page Not Found"". On reloading the page, this usually goes away. This also works very well for VPN connections. Other users connected to it are unaffected and tehy can still surf the web while the VPN connection is on."
4,Works Great,"I got this routor few weeks before and found this working fine with no issues. My basic requirements such as web interface, good security and reception are met and happy with this kit."
3,Netgear WGR614 802.11g Wireless Router,"Second time i am purchasing the same router. Both the time it took half an hour to do the set up...with little struggle, but its easy set up if we follow the instuction in the CD came along."
1,broken so soon and customer support is no good,"Though I don't use my wireless NETGEAR WGR614 very often, it was broken soon after a year, and it now generates very high pitched sharp sound which is so annoying. I don't want to call their customer support again."
1,Odds are 50/50..skip this router,"I have two, one works perfectly and the other is buggy, hence the 50/50.The bad one needs unplugged/replugged as it appears to lose power and all associated connections, wired/wireless. It may go a day, week or hours, but it is a consistent PAIN.You get what you pay for...and don't even think about installing this for somebody else unless you want to be THEIR tech support when the inevitable issues occur."
1,PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I bought this router six months before and struggling to get this work for me. I have tried all means to get this work(firmware updates, re-installing the router many times, all the options available in the internet) but no luck. I would not recommend this product to any one. PLEASE DO NOT BUT THIS PRODUCT."
1,A Piece Of JUNK,"All seemed fine with this at first and then getting up one morning a year after buying this thing,nothing worked and none of my computers could get on line. I phoned their ""tech support"" and discovered how worthless the 3 year warranty was. If I wanted this thing fixed I had to shell out the Money to get it working again. I put it in it's box and ordered one made by a different company. I keep it around so I'm reminded to NEVER buy anything from Netgear ever again"
1,Didn't work for me,"I had bad luck with this product. I found the setup process easy enough, but the box was not very reliable. Ever few days it would lock-up for some unknown reason. I had to power cycle the box to make it work again. I've now replaced it with an equivalent Linksys 802.11g router box which has been problem-free."
1,Wireless Connection Unstable,I have been fighting this router ever since I received it. My laptop connects to other wireless routers with no problems but connecting to this netgear router is intermittent (even when I set my laptop right next to the router). Get something else!
2,Stay away,"This router works wonderfully but only when it works :(. I have to recycle the power at least once in 2-3 days. Already went through one exchange - same problem again. After 90 days, Netgear does not provide support - so I don't know how will the 3 year warranty work. Seems like after 90 days, one has to go though the premium support first ($2 per min) and if they agree later that there is a hardware problem, they will refund the support fee and replace the product, otherwise ......Don't buy this router if you are looking for a reliable and troublefree router. D-link, US Robotics may be a better choice."
5,I gave it a try and I got more than what I expected,"Before I bought this router along with the Netgear card, I've done quite alot of research about other brands. It took me about 30min to get it working but the performance of this combo have been amazing so far. I installed the router in the basement and went browse the web on the 3rd floor with no problem so far. I've gotten at least 24Mbps. It's either my house construction material is cheap or this router really works great."
5,Great Router,"I purchased this router because my older Linksys router wouldn't work well with Vonage (an internet phone company). This new router works great with it. I also share my internet connection with another computer and a wireless laptop, both of which work great.To get the router to work you have to follow the directions word for word (duh). I think why many people have problems getting their router setup is because they do not turn off their cable modem.All in all it's a really great router that is small and easy to setup."
1,Buyer Beware!,"This has been the WORST piece of junk, barely works, the set up was awful, and the help line truly should be a SNL skit. I was on and off hold for 30 minutes with people who were just trying to sellme their extended warranty. Spoke to three people all were sales people no one ever came on the line to help me."
1,worthless hunk of crap,I bought this to replace a dieing d-link router. It was easy to set up and started working automatically. I only have it hooked up to 2 computers. The little bastard constantly times out every day. There's a reason it's so cheap. Listen to the other reviews and don't buy it. Last time I buy Netgear.
5,Great for small houses,"I got this router to set up at my grandmas house, so I could use the interet wirelessly there too. I set-up 3 routers in my fife time, a belkin, a linksys, and this one, this one was the easiest one to set-up. It works great for small houses with not too much internet usage, It was verry easy to set up, very simple!! This router is compatible with Apple computers and other products. It has stands so you can lay it down flat or stand it up straight. I Recomend this product to anyone.(I'm useing my moms account!)Bye!!"
3,"Except for the connectivity drop, this is still an average router","Had a lot of problems initially because it wouldn't configure. Connecting the Netgear WGR614 Wireless-G Router through a LAN cable did the trick. Yes, I was connected finally and wireless now! I never trust the default settings and had to change the SSID password. Also enabled the WPA encryption and MAC authentication. It works fine on both the 108.11b and g networking but the connectivity issues kept cropping up despite all attempts. And it is really annoying to reboot the system every time this issue cropped up. There are times when my DNS requests get timed out."
2,Gets VERY HOT,"This is WGR614 v6. I can't comment on reliability under load and long term - I only used it for a day, but it gets ridiculously hot even without any traffic traveling through it."
1,Junk. Avoid.,"This router works great when it's up - great speed, excellent range on the wireless, and 54 Mbps throughout the entire house.The problem is that it cuts out about every 1-2 hours and after a while it drives you crazy. It doesn't do much for your productivity, either. Sometimes you have to restart it half a dozen times to get it up again.In summary I recommend avoiding this router. The wireless is unreliable and I wasted entire too much time thanks to that."
4,Good router for the price,"(...) Its a good router and will do anything you want it to do. For the people having connection problems make sure you go into WAN SETUP and UNCHECK ""Connect Automatically"". This is a real problem. When this is check the Router will ""Turn off"" internet connection after it has been idle for a while. The problem is that sometime it can't sense when to turn it back on! As of writing this, mine has been up 62 days. No more connection problems. Hope this helps..."
5,Great Router,"I recently ordered a new laptop from gateway to replace my 5 1/2 yr old Windows 98SE Compaq. It came with this router. Since My laptop had to be customized, the router arrived about a week ahead of the laptop. So i decided to set it up with my current computer. Even running windows 98se i was up and running 10 minutes out of the box. i also connected my xbox and had no problems whatsoever. then when my laptop arrived it took like another 5 minutes to connect the wireless function. Much easier and faster than my older linksys router. And it's cheaper too. Would definately recommend over a linksys router."
1,WGR614 new user,I found this router installation very tough. I am a sw guy but could install all h/w by myself.. But I found the manual not sufficient.. I was trying to setup this router along with my Bellsouth DSL model.. I tried their first step of connecting the cables .. switched off all of them and then switched on one by one in the order they have said (i did this for 12 hrs) nothing seems to be working... I have returned this item to Amazon .. I searched the web then i found that they have problem with the router firmware which doesnot work with most of the dsl modems available now..I wouldnot recommend anyone buying this router.
1,"unbelievable, how bad it can be.","I bought this router because I believe Netgear product is good. However, it is not. This router make hate Netgear. I owned a Netgear router before, and that one work great. But, right now, different story. The current one is very slow and wireless signal is weak weak and weak. furthermore, you can't go to some website some time. No more Netgear.~~~~~~~So disappointed"
1,Worst product I have ever used,"The network is hard to config, I have to reboot many times to get a connection. It is such a piece of crap, I am giving up on this company forever!"
3,Great Router....ONLY if you're using Window$.,"I have 2 apple computers, one desktop and one laptop, and I HAD a separate desktop that ran Fedora. This router forced me to wipe fedora and install Windoze XP(ensive), and I have to have the XP computer on CONSTANTLY just to use the wireless on my macs. No mac software included or supported."
1,Doesn't work with many cable modems!,"I spent an hour on the phone with tech support for this piece of junk. They told me that it doesn't communicate correctly with many cable modems, including my 3com modem from RCN. Go with something else!!"
1,waste of time,I wasted a day trying to get wireless to work on this thing. It simply does not work. Netgear must have hired the Linksys QA department for this one.
1,lots of problems,"My computer isMicrosoft XP, Pentium 4I got a wireless Built in my computer , so I dont need a Wirelss card,Netgear 614 has had lots of Problems, Resetting password problems, the products came with a Installation disc. and its been going off the Internet every time I install it ,Every 1 gave it a 5 star rating, I RATE IT POOR ,its good for keeping visuses back ,once u install it once,the first time we had no problem istalling the disc and making passwords , but later I wanted to Partition my hard drive And start my computer over from scratch , and then I wanted to Re install it ,every was fine but the password was rong or , it could Not conect to the net, or It said my Cord isent conected to net router.I BOT mine at Circiut City In SANTA ROSA California , by COTTING town mall , $60.oo I paidCall and Scream and get your money back dont, wait to long , if u do call the toll free number from net gear and tell them the problem"
2,"Excellent features, but in practice this unit has probems","I upgraded from a Linksys firewall and Apple Airport to this unit and was delighted with the great price, wireless range, and configurable features (although there is no way to log attempted intrusions). But once I fired up iChat and tried to video chat I was defeated by this router, which simply refuses to let video or audio chat work, and Netgear even acknowledge there is a problem with this at their support pages. This had worked perfectly through the Linksys. Then, as I worked further with the router, I discovered that the wireless connection is spotty - dropping maybe twice an hour for a few seconds at a time. Again, this seems to be something many compain of.Overall, it seems wonderful, but has ultimately let me down. I am looking for a new router."
1,"Terrible router, terrible support, didn't work at all","Could not even get it to work with WIRED connections. Could only ping the router haphazardly. Spent hours trying to fix, with and without the ""technical support"". The technical support came to the conclusion that I just got a bad router and I should return it for a different one. I did this, and all the problems were the same. I've used three other routers in the past year, all worked very well.What a JOKE!"
2,"Good feature set, but it hangs up more than once a week","The configuration options are great (associating IP's with specific MAC's, port forwarding, etc), but I've had it for about a month and had to reboot (i.e., unplug and replug the power cord) 6 or 7 times, because it will suddenly cut off all internet access and no longer respond when I try and open the web configuration tool (or even just ping it). I DO NOT have to reboot the DSL modem, so I reason the problem is the WGR614. My old firewall stayed up for months (but I replaced it because it was a SonicWall and they wanted $300 to increase the number of active connections to greater than 10!). I'm not impressed."
1,Crashes everyday,"I bought a WGR614 at the beginning of November. Everyday I have to reboot the device by cycling its power. The symptoms are:No routing;No wireless, or slow wireless;No response to ICMP pings;No response to web configuration;Status lights do not indicate a problem;No DHCP server.These symptoms sometimes appear in different combinations. I switched the DHCP service to a conventional server so that I would not lose TCP/IP services on Ethernet.I have called NetGear's India support line four times. Everytime I call they suggest the same troubleshooting steps (push the reset button). They apparently do not have the capability of tracking customer issues--they just read from a script. I am attempting to get an advance exchange for a replacement unit. If NetGear will not exchange the unit, I will try the distributor.While reading these reviews, I notice that the negative reviews are frequently rated less than helpful, while the positive reviews are generally rated helpful. Hmm...."
1,unit ok/tech support very poor/very$$$,"unit required a call to tech support to set up, got it up and running after about 25 minutes,had a problem 4 months later and netgear wants me to pay $29.95 per call to tech support b/c free tech support is only available for 90 days. i asked the person from netgear who told me this if i was being ""punked"" but he said he was serious.i then went out and bought a microsoft unit with much better support and they have treated me excellent. my advice ...go with a company that will give you more tech support and backing for its products."
1,90 days of fun,"I'm computer savvy but don't know very much about networks. I was shocked, then, when I bought this router and a netgear wireless card and was up and running in minutes. For 3 months, it worked wonderfully, and I'm now hooked on wireless. But then, for no real reason, the router just stopped working. I couldn't get an answer from email or the website, and like other reviewers have mentioned, the tech-support is a joke (30 minute wait, can't understand them because it's outsourced in India, don't solve anything anyway). I was a huge Netgear fan for those first ninety days, and now I'll never buy another product from them again. Poor form."
2,Suddenly stops working too frequently,"HiI brought the netgear WGR614 Wireless router, WG511 PC Card, and WG311 PCI card arund 3 weeks back. Though the initial setup was easy i am seeing too many issues with this.1. The router suddenly stops working and my PC card is not able to connect to it. The only way i can get it to work is plug out the power cable of the router. Then it works. I am ok with it if its once in a week or so but i had to do it almost alternate day.2. My PCI card running on desktop with Windows XP does not connect to the router but the same PCI card with WINDOWS 98 connects fine.Hope this helps.Thanks"
1,Netgear WGR614 is flawed,"I purchased the Netgear WGR614 mainly because of its ability to limit access to the wireless network via a MAC address along with using Wep encryption. I wanted more security. My old SMC Barricade Router only used Wep encryption, but had a solid wireless connection. The Netgear router installs very easily as do most routers now days and the hard wire ports work fine, but the wireless connection would drop every 10 to 15 seconds at only 20 ft away. I tried downloading the latest firmware, but to no avail. Needless to say, the connectivity issue was unacceptable and I gave it away."
2,Go with LinkSys,"I chose to buy the NetGear router because it was about $10 cheaper than LinkSys, plus it got a great review from CNET. I was disappointed with the router, though. The connection drops to a really low speed all the time, and the farthest I've ever used it is about 30 feet with two walls of separation.Also, when my friend came over with his laptop, he was unable to even connect to my network because he uses .11b instead of .11g. Be warned, if you plan on using b and g simultaneously, this router is definitely not for you.In conclusion, I would recommend paying more for the brand that more people trust: LinkSys.Happy hunting!"
1,needs a reset every now and then,"This router needs to be reset (unplugged then plugged in) almost every other day. All of my computers will recognize the router but for some reason the connection is lost every now and then. A reset takes care of it every time. But that's annoying enough for me to rate this product one star. Other than that, it works but definitely not the way it should."
4,Value for Money,I bought this item in Dec 2006. It was easy to install and is working great. I was a bit sleptical about it since some of the reviews talked abt dropped links....but its wroking absolutely fine and I am happy with the purschase. Its slek design occupies less space as we.....So go for it !
3,"Not hard to set up, sometimes flaky",My wireless signal disappears once in a while (even cannot find the router in wireless connection list). I don't need to do a thing other than patiently wait it to recover.I don't know it's the router issue or comcast issue. Otherwise this router is easy to set up and looks pretty cool.
4,As advertised,"It installed without a hitch by following the simple instructions. It is working reliably. And I operate it with a Macintosh, Safari."
2,Drops connection.,"After 3 months of working satisfactorily, the router drops connection, both wireless and wired connections. It is a botheration to keep unplugging and replugging the device. Tech suppport was reasonable, gave a few firmware updates, but didn't help. I am not keeping this..."
1,Mediocre product with terrible support,"Not as easy to install as some of the techies around this site seem to think, at least in my experience. Took a whole lot longer and more effort than alleged, and yes, I read a lot of the reviews here for tips, which saved time, but certainly didn't solve the problem.Now that it's working, it's OK. It needs re-booting way more often than it should, and drops the signal too often, but you probably cannot expect top of the line quality at this price.However, you should be able to expect some level of acceptable support. You will not be getting that with this, or I'd wager, any Netgear product. I'd look elsewhere. I've never used a Linksys product before, but after this experience, they'll be getting a shot at my business, since Netgear will never, ever get another order from me."
1,Incredibly Difficult to Setup and Does Not Work with BellSouth,"The person who wrote the most glowing 5 Star review must be a true computer genius, because I am fairly computer literate, and it took me hours and hours to try to set up, and finally had to give up and hire someone to come and set it up for me. Granted, it is true, there appear to be special problems with the Bellsouth Westel Router, so that was part of the problem. But I have had this thing for coming up on a year now, and it frustrates me no less now than it did when we bought it. Constantly losing connection. Currently, although I am happy (sadly enough) to say I can use the internet with this darn thing hooked up, I cannot get it to produce a wireless signal. I would never buy this product again, and may go ahead and bite the bullet and buy a different product."
1,easy but keeps dropping signal,I've put up with this for longer than I should have. It set up real easy but I keep losing the signal for no apparent reason. Ethernet stays going but wireless is not recognized. I have to unplug the power to the router and plug it back in. I get right back online but lose what I was doing. Also signal doesn't seem very strong lots of times.
4,Easy installation,"I was installing the router to both a desktop G4 and an iBook. Using the installation wizard, I had the notebook up and running in minutes. I'm impressed by the range.I wish the Mac instructions had been a little more thorough, hence 4 stars instead of 5. For any other Mac users: scrap your locations under ""networking"" and start from scratch, don't edit an old one.At first I couldn't get my desk computer onto the internet, because I was still trying to go online through PPoE. But, then I went through the same process as I used for the laptop, in other words logging into the router through my browser, and all was fine. So far, I'm really pleased."
4,Simple and Reliable,"I used this to replace an existing Netgear wired-hub connected to a cable modem. Comcast is our ISP. Installation couldn't have been easier. The wired connections needed no work at all beyond plugin. Our Mac, running OS X, needed only to have Airport turned on for wireless. The PC, running Win 2000, needed only straighforward installation of Netgear WAG511 card. The default settings worked for us, so documentation was adequate. I have had to reinstall the WAG511 software on the PC once. Don't know why. Range is good. Browser-based security settings are great. Stay plugged in if you're downloading software."
3,Works for a while....,"I have the router for about 6 months. It worked great for the first 5 months or so... solid connection and easy to use. Now it is very flaky with the wireless part.... I used to connect fine with a WGE101 wireless bridge (never shutdown, but that maybe the problem). Slowly it moves from excellent connection to a hit/miss thing and recently has stopped working totally.The version that I got was version 1... which probably means it is the worst of the bunch...."
1,Bad products and bad service,"I got their product because of a rebate and what I thought was a good product and company. When I got the items, it work fine but then I started to have problems and had to unplug it to get it to work. One day it just stoped working and I called customer service and they could not figure out what was wrong after hours on the phone with them. Then I came to find out that they made up some error with the rebate form and I would not be getting my rebate. Their customer service sucks and I will never buy their products again."
1,"Good range, bad firm ware and no updates.","This router is serviceable and has good range but the firmware corrupts the memory. This causes the configuration tables tobecome corrupted beyond the ability of the web interface tocorrect.For example this causes the port forwarding to stop working and the port forward menue to no longer show the configuration. I can not redo the forwarding because the web interface is confused and will not let me delete, edit or add port forward. If I have been unfortunate enough to save my configuration during this corruption then that too is corrupted. If I have a backup that isn't corrupted I can do a hard reset back to factory defaults, via a little button on the back and restore the backup. Most of the time the corruption is in the backup too and I have no choice but to reconfigure the router from scratch. This happens about every month.This router has very bad firmware, and no prospects of improvement. This router has wasted a lot of my time anda little money."
2,Don't throw your patch cables away...,Seems to be a recurring theme. Utilizing the WGR614 with a wired connection works great. However I got sporadic wireless connections (at best) even when sitting right on top of the antenna. Tried every firmware update (even beta versions) to no avail. Tech support wasn't very supportive. Spend the extra money and get the linksys.
2,"easy to use, but ""buggy""","This was my first router, and I found the configuration menus on this product to be easy to use, with nice detailed descriptions of options. HOWEVER, as some of the other reviews have hinted, it is often necessary to reset (power cycle) the router. Either DHCP fails at the beginning of a session, or it cuts out during operation. Assigning fixed IP addresses to local computers helps, but it will still cut out from time to time. Latest firmware upgrade seems to make things a bit worse. (outsourced firmware? haha)"
1,Router gone bad after 4 months,The router seemed to work fine in the beginning but then I upgraded the firmware to the latest version 5.02 and the router has now gone bad. I have much lost time trying to resolve this and now have to pay shipping fees to send out the bad router for RMA. This does not seem fair since the router is only 4 months old. I will be very wary of Netgear products in the future.
4,Good deal for sure.,"This router was quick to set up but it has a lot of nice features hiding under the hood. Overall, a decent offering."
2,Don't be fooled by the price!,"I purchased this unit 11 months ago. Everything went well at first. It was easy to set up and things seemed fine. Several months ago, I started having problems with internet connectivity. Rebooting has helped, at times, but it is very inconsistent. I agree with other posters regarding Netgear's customer service. It is among the worst that I have dealt with. I have been reading the reviews for the Linksys Wireless g Router, and will be replacing this hunk-o-junk with the Linksys."
2,Netgear Router Eval,I gave up on installing this piece of equipment. I bought a Linksys and installed it in 10 minutes
3,decent,"Pro: cheap, 54G decent wireless range.Cons: has heat problems, and seems dns on the router is not working correctly"
1,Absolute piece of rubbish,I have had three replacements from Netgear and not one has worked. The most I have got is a short period of connectivity for a day or so then the whole thng dies. Save your money. DON't buy Netgear
4,Netgear WGR614 Wireless-G Router,I have been using this product since one month till now i didnt have any issues with this.Its good product.
4,It works,It works and it came in on the day it said it would. Now I have some wireless to use with my phone!! Yay!!
2,"Version difference: WGR614v8 four star, WGR614v9 two star.","Do not scared by those one star reviews, the router has undergone 10 generations from WGR614v1 to WGR614v10, I belive those one star reviews attribute to the earlier version of this product.My friend has a WGR614v8 and it is very stable and with surprisingly good Qos,which is quite important for smooth web surfing under heavy load. We buy the same model and expected to be the same but turned to be a wrong decision, the current one (bought at Walmart at 02/2010) is actually a different model: WGR614v9, with only 8MB Ram and 2MB flash Rom, only half of the WGR614v8, and more important no more Qos in router firmware, it is much slower than the WGR614v8, especially under heavy load thus need manual reboot. It is a shame that netgear ruin such a good product to make room for more expensive model while still trying make money from a cost down version."
5,netgear makes wireless mad easy,Such an easy setup that I was amazed. It was so easy to get it ready that I was surprised. I went to their setup website and in less than 2 minutes it was perfectly working
3,Net Gear WGR614 Review,Its a good product in terms of ease of installation and setup but range is not goood
3,Is it the router Or is it the ISP,"I've been using this router for two days and already I've begun to notice delays in the pages it serves, both for wired and wireless connections. I agree with other reviewers that customer support at NetGear is not the best. After having read other reviews about the latency with which pages are served, I will return this product tomorrow."
3,"wire is fine, but wireless have problem",I have wgr614 v5. After a few months the wireless doesn't want to work. just on and off.
2,Basics work fine / Keyword filtering is flawed,"The various PC's, my Macbook, and Wii all connect to this router fine and work well. I never get dropped.I do have a problem with the keyword filtering. This router has a feature the is suppose to allow you to enter keywords to block access to websites containing the keywords. This feature is supposed to work with keywords found in the URL or within the page content. Even with the keywords entered and features activated, I'm still able to get to many sites containing the banned keywords. It seems to detect when the keyword is part of the URL, but not the page content. Too bad. One of the reasons I purchased this router was for the parental control feature.If you don't need these feature, this is a great wireless router."
2,almost junk,"These seem to overheat and die after about a year. I took mine apart after it stopped working and there was noticable heat damage to the plastic on the inside. Also, if you move a LOT of data it will become confused after about a day and need to be reset."
2,Looks are deceiving,"I had a Netgear MA314 and it was truly wonderful. Robust, strong signal - what more could I want? So I get the snazzy looking WGR614 and figure the extra ""g"" speed would be good, but it [stinks]...- signal strength is appalling- unlike the ma314 the build quality (plastic vs. metal in the ma314) is substandard- trying to mask the ssid results in extremely poor connection and dropped signal stays droppedstick to the old style and don't worry about ""g"" - it's not ready - i'm running ""b"" now and it's the only way to get a half decent signal"
2,Forget customer service from these folks,"This thing installed OK per the brief cheat sheet included, but then when I tried to configure security I found that the instructions simply didn't work. Not even close. URLs listed in the docs resulted in DNS errors or 404s. Called tech support once, navigated through the endless prompts and when I finally got dumped in the support queue, I was disconnected within a few seconds. I foolishly tried again, navigated through all the junk again, and was *almost* in the queue when a recorded message announced that ""we're sorry, your call cannot be completed as dialed. Please check the number and try again."" There's merely indifferent customer service and merely mediocre documentation out there, and then there's Netgear. What a joke."
1,The Worst POS Router Ever,I am an IT professional. I have installed many different routers over the years but this is by far the worst. 2 for 2 have failed in the field. They are basically throw aways because off-shore tech support is helpless. I'd give them 0 stars if I could. Linksys is a bit more reliable but their tech support is just as bad. Netgear's ProSafe line is much better but much higher priced. Stay away from these POS consumer routers.
4,It is perfect for me,It does all I need in an easy way and affordable price. I use it at home and I can even take it to anywhere else because of its small size and clean design.
2,Problem with freezing.,"I put up with this dropping issue for the last 8 months trying everything and anything reading forums and experimenting. The problem was the router locking up, unable to continue internet access to the DSL modem. This occurred A) randomly, B) when I'd open multiple tabs in Safari browser at once. I had confirmed DSL modem was not at fault.My best guess was the router had gotten damaged over time from overheating. Well, my answer to that is - I have a TON of other electronic equipment in my house under identical conditions that are still working fine.My answer was to buy an Apple Airport Extreme, and immediately all the freezing problems went away."
1,Stops working for no reason and technical support is HORRIBLE,"I get error messages when I try to use this product and Netgear's technical support is located in India, which means I have to repeat my serial number 10 times, only to have them refuse to help me because I bought the product more than 6 months ago. I will never buy another Netgear product!"
4,nice little unit,"price point for value, replaces a d-links 2 antenna router that died after 2 yrs, works fine in my 2000 sq ft home. very happy after 1 month of use."
5,Better get this one now,"This does the job perfectly, and the newer models have unneeded features and are three times the expense. One can no longer get this model at the major computer big box stores, I found. So if you know this has what you want, get it quickly. Mac and pc compatible. My previous one blew out in a surge, so I also got (elsewhere) a super surge strip for my surge strips. The better surge strip has saved several other delicate computer appliances. So, sorry this review is so untechnical, but what I am trying to say is, this is an excellent, sturdy piece of equipment that if you protect carefully will work better than the new ones. I don't understand why others say it is unreliable. The first one lasted years, and this one is going strong, 24/7."
5,good product,It was sent to me within only two days and very easy to be installed and used. Very good product!
1,Made in China - Support Center in India - bad combo!,"The title says it all. The set up interface is not easy to use, and the instructions are terrible. But on the box they claim 24/7 support, so why not call and get some help, right? Ha. After 20 minutes on the phone with 3 different support reps, I gave up! The first one took all my and router infromation, didn't even get to the problem before transferring me to someone else. THe second one said it was the wrong department and transfered me to the third erp who started to walk me through the set up, but then the call was disconnected.... Worse customer support I ever experienced - bad voice quality on the phone, combined with heavy accents and poor training. Back to the store my new Netgear goes, and never Netgear again!"
4,loved it,great buy if ur not using wireless internet yet n for the price u cant beat it easy setup n pretty reliable.
1,Wireless Never Works,"I tried setting this router up using the installation CD and default settings and the wireless will not work. I have tried resetting and everything. Even tried exchanging for another unit, but nothing works. I have played with every setting I can think of that might make a difference and still no luck. I haven't tried tech support yet, but if these routers can't work out of the box, they are worthless. I had a Linksys 54G before this and it was a breeze. Please DO NOT buy this router! Go with Linksys in a heartbeat. The guy on the Netgear Tech Support forum doesn't even know proper English and the forum is covered in posts of people with all kinds of problems with this router. Again spend more money and get a different brand router, PLEASE!"
1,Second one - both junk,"After one started dropping out each night (refuses wireless connections) I replaced it with a newer one of the same model. Within weeks it started the same thing. The first one lasted about 1 year, the second just weeks.Completely standard setup, nothing unusual. I can find many forum posts online saying the same thing."
2,Inexpensive but too slow,"I bought this because I previously had the older version of this router and blew it out by accident. After installing this router I noticed a CONSIDERABLE slowing of both wireless and wired internet. I would not suggest this product. It was easy to install and it looks fine, but who cares if it is too slow."
2,Disappointing,"Disappointing product. If you only have a computer that you're connecting to the internet, it works fine. I also have a wireless HP printer, and the router regularly disconnects me from the internet and fails to complete long print jobs. I would be careful about buying this product if you intend to use it to communicate between different wireless devices."
1,NETGEAR IS A SCAM DO NOT PURCHASE!,"NETGEAR IS A SCAM!!!! DO NOT PURCHASEI lost my password and username about 2 years ago. I called to get a new one and they told me i cannot reset my username or password unless i pay a $79.99, for a 6 months of customer service. I told them to shove and i ended up buying a belkin"
1,Not serious about customer service,1. VPN client links broken on the website2. VPN client links broken within the downloadable software3. Offshore call center is unintellgible and transfers you to some garbage call centerDon't buy netgear if you expect any type of customer support whatsoever...
3,Support Servise,Support service is very slow and takes along time to get through to. I would not recommend netgear based on this problem.
5,Great Router,This is a fast router with a very reliable connection. Don't miss this one! It's the deal of a lifetime! I love it!
3,on dropping connections,"This is actually an excellent router for the price and functionality. The problem with it dropping connections is a design flaw not in its wiring, but in its design. You'll find that if you placed the unit in a very cool place, it won't drop connections at all. The unit itself overheats because there isn't adequate ventillation. A few searches online will point you in the direction that other fond users have taken: mounting a case fan to the unit itself.Other than the overheating issues, this is a really good product."
3,"Ok router, until it started overheating and dying","Router worked great for a year and a half, and then proceeded to drop connections randomly. I would have to disconnect and reconnect the power supply to get it to work at full speed. Today, it finally died (two years into use). Not even heatsinking the chipset (google netgear routers and overheating) could save it."
2,Using a wireless router as a wired one,"I was not able to install the wireless setup for the router, so currently I am using it as a wired router.Try reinstalling it multiple times, and cudnt get much help from sustomer care either."
2,Started failing immediately after warranty expired,This Netgear router worked flawlessly for me for ONE year. After that it intermittently would loose wireless connection.
1,Router fails at 3 months,"I bought this router for its wireless and wired capabilities and price.But after 2 months started losing connection intermittently. I did the troubleshooting and work a few times more... a month later:Again to start the same:- lose connection- automatic test in the router is activated- connection is still lost- connection is restored (1 or 2 minutes)I checked for firmware upgrade, I did this, and reset router and other config detailsbut the problem still continue and as the 3months warranty expired.It is router is gone...And customer service completely hides their email address.I would not buy a Netgear product again"
3,WGR614 v6 even better than v1,"I replaced my 2 year old WGR614 v1 with the new v6 because it had taken about 7 six-foot falls to a hardwood floor and the wireless function finally gave out. (Many ""thanks"" to my ISP techie for the falls)The new version is even better than the older one, including set-up, and it performs just as it should.Looking for a reliable and moderately easy to set up wireless router? --- go with the WGR614 v6."
2,WGR614 router,"Bought this last year from amazon. Sounds like a good package. First and foremost, the tech support is limmited to 90 days after which you get charged like 30 bucks a call. Setting up my router would have been impossible without tech support as they told me certain drivers and files to download for my windows XP machine in order to make it work. The absolute most annoying thing is that the router seems to drop the connection frequently. I have looked this up on several other review sites and I am not alone. If you're going to spend money on a router, don't by netgear for 2 reasons: 1 horrible tech support and 2: crappy product. Not much more to say. Anyone wanna by my router? kia_md@hotmail.com"
1,"worked fine, died, no warranty support","This device worked great out of the box for almost a year. Then would not even power on correctly. Had one response from e-mail support to try obvious remedial steps. After, heard nothing. Evidently Netgear not only lacks support but does not honor warranty. I replaced it with an Airlink for $16.99. Now if I can only get a year out of this one!"
3,No Support After 90 Days,"Buyer please beware. There is no tech support after 90 days from the dates purchased. The item works fine with Comcast but recently I just switched to DSL SBC/Yahoo and I couldn't get it to work. So I called support and they told me after 90 days they're no longer support or help with the product. Also, everytime I called for support all the tech speaks with heavy foreign accent and I can not understand about 60% of what they say. Buyers please don't make a mistake like I do call before you buy."
1,Rip Off Artists,"So everyone knows that gadgets usually last about 4-5 years until they really start to ""act up"" and basically fail. Fun fact: Netgear charges you $35 to call them for help after their bogus 90 day warranty. I've never heard of anyone having problems besides hook up with the netgear products until they are a few years old. So basically: NETGEAR DOESN'T STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS AND THEY WANT TO RIP YOU OFF SO DON'T BUY IT UNLESS YOU KNOW HOW TO FIX THESE THINGS AFTER YOUR 90 ""WARRANTY"" HAS EXPIRED!!!!!"
1,Bad deal on amazon,"Great! I got the package within 2 weeks and it worked about 23%. Two ports on the router don't work and the port 3 and 4 slow down my connection. Oh yeah its not even wireless, my 2 (top of the line) Macs lose the connection every other 30 seconds. I'll think twice before I ever buy here again."
3,Could not get it to work,"I never could get this to work even after following the instructions, and then it turns out that Earthlink will only let this operate if I pay a separate monthly fee for the opportunity of connecting my laptop in another part of the house with the desktop in my office. I cannot blame Netgear here. So I give it a neutral, feeling angry about lack of aviso re specific major ISPs."
1,"Wireless works, but wired doesn't work.","It's WAN port stuck at 100Mbps out of the box, won't work with most cablemodem (motorola).Upgraded firmware, WAN port turns 10Mbps, works fine with cablemodem, but LAN ports got stuck at 10Mbps, too.Wireless works very well."
1,"IF YOU'RE NOT A TECH, FORGET IT: IT'S A RIPOFF","Anyone who is not a computer tech should avoid the WGR614. I purchased one in conjuction with buying a new, big-name notebook with wireless card. I also have a big-name cable connection. I'm a computer user, not a tech. Nor am I ignorant, just not a tech. I was never able to get the WGR614 wireless working without technical support, and never able to get it working with WEP or other security. Netgear's answer: don't use WEP. Oh, and be careful . . . tech support is only free until they get the thing working with you for the first time. After that, big per-minute fees for a dude in Bangalore who can barely speak English. And it DID NOT continue working trouble free. The documentation is no help. AVOID THIS ROUTER AS IF IT CARRIES THE PLAGUE."
5,Perfect for me,I wanted Wi-Fi in my house to support my iPod Touch and now I have it. Simple set up in under 10 minutes. Functions beautifully. No issues whatsoever.
1,Connectivity drops every 2-3 minutes,Connectivity drops on this router every 2-3 minutes and I'm left with no other option besides powering up the router again..and the story repeats itself over and over again. I'm trashing this router and buying another one.
2,Do not waste your money - Netgear has nice packaging but a terrible product,Do not waste your money - Netgear has nice packaging but a terrible product. Netgear skimps on technology and quality and spends more on product appearance. I have to restart my router at least three times a day...and sometimes I have to restart it 5 consecutive times just to get it going again. Some say it might be the ISP but I have another computer connected through an ethernet connection - no problem there when my wireless connection drops.
5,2nd Netgear Wireless Router,"There is some good stuff in the review by Cyberdesi. David McCulloch's review is a good recap of my experience except I think David overstates how hard it is. I just set up my second one (a gift to a friend). Turn off your computer & modem. Plug in the router: to the computer, to the modem & to the wall. Turn on the modem. Turn on the router. Turn on the computer. In that order, per directions. All done. Well, it's wise to fire up net access & double check. Make any of the adjustments Cyberdesi addresses now. It isn't obvious to me how to make it any easier to do.Now I hear we are getting cable at the condo at the beach. Guess I'll get a third Netgear wireless. Maybe I should buy stock??"
2,"Probably a good router, but not if you're running Mac OS X","I want to like this router, but it's been tough. This is my fourth router and set-up time for this one is triple all the others combined. It took a lot of time fiddling with the WEP settings before my powerbook g4 airport card would communicate with the router. Something still isn't right and I'm forced to power cycle the router (pull the plug) every third time the powerbook wakes from sleep. It's not possible to print from the wireless powerbook (unless my desktop computer is on and printer sharing is on). Finally, after a long call with tech support -- easily an hour long -- I've now found out that there is an ""issue"" with AOL. This router and AOL do not mix, at least on the Mac. I was told that Netgear are aware of the problem and that they are working to fix it.... In the meantime, I'll purchase another router."
2,Frustrating......,"I have this router with 2 Netgear 11g PCI cards, plus a laptop with ethernet connection. It looks great and is incredibly small and unobtrusive. Getting it to work as a router with my Comcast cable service required help from tech support to 'spoof' the MAC address, but no big problem.....until I tried to use the wireless capabilities: I can establish connection but then it drops after anything from 2 minutes to 24 hours. Tech support (level 1 & 2) were useless and I am still waiting for level 3 to call me.....If I get it working, I will update this post, otherwise BUYER BEWARE"
5,Fantastic compared to Linksys,"I first purchased a Linksys wrt54g. Having Wi-Fi experience on b routers, The first thing I noticed was poor range. I also depend on NetMeeting, Remote Desktop Sharing, and other tools requiring a 'smart router'. I returned and bought the Netgear. I immediatley noticed the range improvement, and programs that would not work properly on the Linksys work fine on the Netgear. It's that simple. Security features also work as advertised."
1,Great until it died,"This router worked for about 14 months. I disconnected it one day, and then it would never work again. It powers up, the lights work, but the computer doesn't find it. I replaced it with the Linksys, which is working great."
3,Not One Problem,Had a Linksys Wireless- B Broadband-802.11b that I couldn't get to opperate on my new computer. When attached to my old one it would drop my internet connection repeatedly. My new Netgear 802.11g wireless installed without any problems and nevry drops a connectio to my server. A great product.
1,Customer support is atrocious,I purchsed this item in November 2003 and had just called customer support in March 2004 to find out why the router keeps disconnecting all of a sudden. First of all I was put on hold for about 20 minutes and then after being transfered from one department to another I was informed that they will not support my call because it is over their 90 day support period and that I could either email them or pay for the service. I then emailed them and was just sent a generic response to my issue.If this is the kind of support you want then I urge you to buy Netgear products but let me tell you that I also own a Linksys router and they still support my calls after 5 years. I will never purchase a Netgear product again. By the way they route all their calls to India to save cost.
4,actually it shud b 4.5 out of 5,The Product is very simple to install and works perfectly fine with the configuration mentioned.I'm very much happy to buy this netgear product. which is cheap as well as serves the purpose in the best way.
2,Broke before I got to use it!,"I had this item for about three days when it broke. My computer was brand new also. I knew I had everything hooked up right. Finally, I had to pay a technician to come out because I thought there was something wrong with my computer. I sent the router back for a refund. The technician sold me another NetGear router and it's been working fine. Maybe I just got a bad one. I hope so but it cost me a lot of money to find out."
4,Worked for me until it bricked.,"I had this router for about 3 years I think. Never had any problems except when netgear changed the router settings for internet accesss. I have an apple imac, xbox, panasonic dvd, roku, an old laptop PC, and they all connected to this wirelessly without any problems. I started to notice some glitchyness with the xbox a few weeks ago, and then last night the hetgear wireless started to fail, and then gave out completely and died. It lasted about 3 years, maybe longer. I was using version 8 so I cannot complain. I dont expect these routers to last forever because they are running 24/7 and this one we taxed a bit with kids running skype and watching netflix, and playing games at the same time. I noticed no speed problems at all. The user interface is a little bit perplexing online but I was able to figure it out. Time for an upgrade now."
2,Simple but Unreliable,"Setup and installation is simple. Although it'll work to get multiple devices connected to the internet, it's nothing but issues with this router. It has to constantly be powered off to allow devices to access it. Several times a week one or more of my computers, iPod, PS3 will fail to connect and can only connect after the router or both have been unplugged and restarted. Which is slightly annoying when alone, but very annoying when others are using the internet and you have to tell them to get off it so you can unplug the router. The one I have also can't be set in the upright position as it then makes a squealing noise every time the lights blink. Not loud, but noticeable. So only purchase if cheap and no other option. If you do make sure to keep it in an easily accessible location as it will need to be unplugged regularly."
4,NetGrear,"Easy setup, was able to get access to interface very easily.Easy to set port forwarding feature and there seems to be no limit as to how many settings you can use. I am still going after 10!"
4,works as intended,"I bought this as a replacement for the original I owned which was the same model and was hit by a lightning surge.Plugged it in, set operating criteria and it was good to go.Not as fast as some, but I am on 256k DSL so faster speed is a waste of money.I use it as a hard wired router and am 100% happy as of this time."
3,only okay,"It works when it wants to, drops out randomly. Nothing major, just a nuisance. Am hoping to upgrade when I get the opportunity."
2,It didn't last,"Not the greatest product. The first problem I encountered, I could live with; every couple of months I would lose all Internet access and would have to turn it off, then on again to fix it. Since that was a rare problem and easy to fix, I didn't mind much.However, after a couple of years, it developed a more annoying problem: the wireless network would go away and then come back repeatedly - anywhere from several times a day to several times a minute - on all my devices (2 laptops, Droid phone, and a Roku box on the TV). I tried switching the wifi to different channels, but that didn't help, so I don't think it was due to interference.Time for a new router, and it's not going to be a Netgear!"
2,"Goes down twice a day, overheats","I've had this router for ages now. It sits three feet away from me, and chugs away merrily for 23 hours and 50 minutes a day. If I put a hand on it at a random time, it's often very warm or downright hot.Twice a day or so, my internet connection cuts out, and a router restart (unplug and plug it back in) fixes it. Some days this doesn't happen at all, and maybe the average is closer to once a day, but it's definitely the router. I generally notice it's hotter than average the times it goes down. So maybe the problem's related to temperature.. tough to say for sure.Good thing the router was cheap and my work doesn't rely on an uninterrupted connection. I can survive the minor inconveniences of these outages--they rarely interrupt something mission-critical. Annoying, but not enough to get me to dump $70 on a new router yet. I imagine there's a more reliable option out there for the price, but cheap is cheap and I got what I paid for."
2,It's only usable under low temperature...,"Netgear has great exterior design, however, its hardware inside is totally useless. It frequently stop working in higher temperature, by that, I mean 70F, especially when more than one people connect to it. It works fine for a while (but still slower than its optimal speed) after replug the power cord. However, I still need to replug it at lease once a day. And it's not just my netgear have problem like that, but also my friend's and the dialing one (different model, but with the same issue) in my apartment. So before Netgear fixes this problem, I won't buy any netgear router for a while."
1,Didn't work for me,"Just couldn't get this to work for me, even after spending an hour with Netgear's technical support. For some reason, even though I was connected to it, I couldn't access the internet (even though I could access the internet if I connected directly to my dsl modem). Luckily I purchased this from Fry's, so I'll be returning it and looking at some other alternative."
2,Worked well... for a while,"I bought this router and it worked well... for a while. Now it will frequently just stop working. I find that this usually happens when I am not actively using it. I will come home from work and have no internet connection until I unplug the router. Also, it seems to run very hot.Setup is fairly easy and the interface isn't that bad, but having to unplug it every couple of days is highly annoying. I would not suggest buying this router unless you want a headache."
1,missing parts,"Bought mine from this website and the software was not included, even though it said it was in the description. Also the serial number was blacked out so I couldnt register the unit and download the software. Extremely unhappy with the product and amazon.com for selling it to me. never shopping here again."
1,Unreliable Connection,Easy to set up and worked great for a while. Within 6 months I started losing connection constantly (while I was using it not while grabbing a cup of coffee). I updated the firmware and checked my settings but this did not solve the issue. Customer service commented that this is a common problem and wanted $100 for 6 months of technical support. It is much cheaper to replace this unit than try to fix it. I will NOT be purchasing another Netgear product!
2,WORST customer service EVER.,"Held on to this for six months before I opened the package and installed it. Had a heck of a time getting this thing hooked up.1) The software (CD) didn't work, and the software on line was a serious pain to a) obtain and b) install2) Customer service wouldn't help me because their policy is to deny service 30 days after purchase of the product!3) After doing some serious digging (internet searches, refreshing their webpage) I finally got this thing in order.Netgear lost my business permanently."
5,Works fine for basic wireless networking,"I use this product for basic wireless networking in my apartment. From what I can tell, the security works fine and everything works as it is supposed to. I haven't had any problems on account of the router. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that just needs a simple router.By the way, I would definitely suggest using the WPA over the basic WEP security settings. The toll on performance is minimal if any."
1,Netgear -- getting worst!,"I had a MR814 before, and it ran very well. Then I thought WGR614 should be doing good job too, but it turned out I am wrong -- it dropped me from day to day. I just put it in my garbage bin. No more Netgear!"
4,Its a cheap and best product...,"Its really cheap and best product, good coverage in 2BHK, stabilize speed, good looking, but installation was bit difficult for me."
4,Works out of the box.,I set it up following the instructions and it all seemed to work right out of the box. It does everything I expect it to.
3,"When it works, cool. When it doesn't, not cool.","I got this router a month ago to hook up a desktop mac and two wireless systems; ibook and imac. Netgear's tech support for the Mac sucks. I knew more than they did. Once the router was working with the desktop, the wireless stuff was brainless. I did have a problem, but since the router worked, tech support would just say that I had to call Apple.Any, I am returning the router because the wireless line drops everyday. I have to unplug and router and plug it back in to bring the wireless connections back up. With all that's going on in life, I don't have time to baby sit a router."
2,doesn't support some wireless card,"This router is OK especially for the low price (you can get it for $10 refurbished from time to time), but there are two problems with it.1. I cannot connect to it with my Lenovo t420, which has a INTEL wireless N6205 card. This is consistent, even when there is no other devices connected to the router (hence eliminate the maximum device connection explanation), My other laptop, Lenovo W520, which has a N6200, works perfect and never lose connection.2. My samsung captivate phone can connect to it with wifi for about 2 month. Then for some reason it can never connect back to the same wifi. Even til now it still has the same problem.The router serves several computer, 2 tablets, and a few phones well. Just the above two problem. Use caution if you have the same devices as mentioned above."
4,Good,Not so easy to be installed but finally it worked. Probably I made some misunderstanding while installing but no It is working and I can easily conect to the internet.
1,Disappointed,"This was my third attempt at setting up a router of one brand or another and all either returned or given away after a few weeks. My daughter kept telling me to rent one from Time Warner and I finally did - an it works perfectly. The NetGear was easy to setup but dropped connection frequently and when working was very slow - taking 30 sec. or more to go to another page, wireless or connected. Short videos would frequently stop playing after a few seconds or so and wouldn't go on no matter how long I waited, wireless or connected. Sometimes I couldn't get a connection at all and had to go completely through the setup again and again and again. I didn't try support as I expected little to nothing from past experience with a variety of items. After three weeks of frustration I put it in the GoodWill bag."
1,Failed at 11 months,"I bought this router to replace my (several years old) Netgear router which had an internet port failure that would not repair. Now at 11 months, this router had an internet port failure after spontaneously losing its ability to connect 3 times over 6 months. I've had to factory reset each time and reset up the network. Very disappointed in the quality of this product."
2,Don't Buy This Router!,"This router is a piece of junk. For the price, you can do much better. It's ok under the most simple and basic of uses, but during load or even a simple nmap scan the router just chokes."
2,non responsive router,router did not come with instructions on how to load it into computer so that my desktop computer could talk with it and therefore enable my wifes laptop to work downstairs. So we need to either send it back and get another one with instructions and loading disk or software or at least the essential loading tools to activate router to my dell desktop computer. as it stands right now this router is useless/ please help us do something about asap if we need to send it back send us a label box etc return authorization etc thank you michael j miller
2,stopped working,"worked fine for a couple of years, but it stopped working recently.i've tried a bunch of things to reset it, with no luck.maybe its time warner cable's fault (fyi: brooklyn, ny), buti doubt it, since it seems a lot of other people have had problems.i'm going to get a new one that is hopefully more reliable.p.s. mine is model ""v6""."
4,"it works, no problems","I have set up 6-7 wifi networks over the last 4 years. Between bad quality hardwear and worse documentation, it has been a major pain. My Linksys wifi router crapped out for no known reason (they all fail eventually), so I went to Bestbuy and picked this one up. Also 2 Tivo wifi g thingies to replace the B ones I had. And a Netgear print server (g also). Now I have no more b devices, which drag all other g devices down to their speed. Thought about going to N, but my laptops would need new wifi, which I don't want to mess with.The netgear router installed fairly easily. Using the wizard setup threw it off my cable modem when it rebooted. Just did the manual process and it worked fine.Now I have 2 printers, 2 laptops and 2 desktops, and 3 Tivo boxes all on my wifi g network. Took about 2 hours total to configure it all."
4,Nice Compact Unit,Nice very small compact untit. Easy to install. The price was right! Cheap! I've only had it one day. Works great. Very happy with this purchase.
1,Planning to buy a better wireless router,A worthless piece i have bought and still regretting that decision. It often disconnects while browsing and wont connect for another 20-30 mins. I think it has some problem with the firmware. Planning to buy a better brand.
2,hmm.,"This was a great router, until about a year after I bought it. I woke up one morning to find all the lights on the router on, and I tried every way there was to reset the router to no avail. I thought that maybe this was just a problem with my router, so I recommended netgear to a friend who bought a newer version of the same model. His died about 3 months into using it. Go with linksys."
3,Dirt cheap... for a reason,"As has been widely reported throughout the web, modern revisions of the WGR614 are often prone to processor overheating issues, resulting in partial to complete loss of internet traffic. I discovered that--rather than arranging the router vertically (using the two supplied feet)--arranging it horizontally and elevating the underside to ventillate helps with these issues.For $25 to $30, the WGR614 can be considered a ""tech hobbyists bargain""; modfying the outer case with a CPU fan might be necessary for carefree use in warmer or non air-conditioned climates.Functionality-wise, the router offers not only terrific consumer oriented carefree setup (networking functions right out of the box) but also pleasant advanced features such as automated Dynamic DNS login & updating for cable modem subscribers.While I would like to give this unit 4 stars, the inherent overheating design flaw hurts its rating."
1,Faulty product - problems with DHCP,"I purchased this router a while ago. After installing it and following the setup instructions, I found out the router wasn't obtaining an IP address from the cable network. I tried both using the router's MAC address, and making the router ""clone"" the PC's MAC address; none of them worked. Then I upgraded the router's firmware to its latest version; that didn't help either.At first, I thought the issue had to do with my cable company, but after reverting to my original configuration (PC directly connected to the cable modem), the DHCP problems were solved. Checking in Netgear's forums and in some other sites around the Internet, I've found many customers with similar issues.I decided to discontinue using the router, and to purchase a Linksys WRT54G, which has been working flawlessly.Think twice before purchasing this Netgear router... for the same money, you'll be able to find a better product."
1,"poor performance, no customer support","I bought WGR614v4 months ago. From the very first week the connection was dropping constantly - 4-5 times per day I needed to switch on and off to make it work. The problem was even more so when I used wired connection through this router.But 1 week ago router just stopped working at all - I cannot get any connection at all.I tried to call Netgear support, and as some other reviews already pointed out, after being put on hold for quite some tme you hear: ""the number you have dialed is not correct, try again later"". I am very dissapointed and exhausted by this product and the service. I will never buy Netgear again."
1,doesn't work!!!!,"After reading most of the good reviews for this product, I couldn't wait to receive it once I placed my order...Once received I followed all the installation instruction but this router could not find my ip address, submask, gateway default etc...as it was advertised it could...I've been using an older linksys router and wanted to get something new, but I think I will stick with it or at least with linksys..."
1,Look elsewhere!!!,This router was included for no extra charge when I bought a new laptop. The wireless performance is horrible. It would drop the connection to my computer every 5 minutes. I replaced it with a Linksys access point (I had another router already) and the Linksys works perfectly. I would avoid this router at all costs (even if it's free).
1,Great until it breaks,"Had worked well for nearly a year.Except that Netgear was about the last manufacturer to support WPA, which was annoying.Anyway, after about a year of quietly working in my closet, where nobody touches it and it doesn't suffer from much temperature fluctuation, it broke. The uplink port doesn't work any more. I switched in Apple's Airport Express and that worked fine.If you buy one of these, and they *are* relatively cheap, KEEP THE RECEIPT! You won't be able to get service without it.Also note that their service is in India and weren't very helpful (although they tried to be) when I called asking about WPA.You get what you pay for, I guess. I won't be cheaping out on the replacement. Apple for me."
4,works great with Microsoft PCI Adapter (MN-730),"I bought the wireless g router and pci adapter which all installed fairly easy. After a few hours the pc (win xp pro) would completely freeze and I would have to power off the computer and reboot. Eventually (after a day) the pc would freeze after only a few minutes. I finally returned the card and purchased the microsoft wireless pci adapter (MN-730) which works flawlessly! WOW!!!! constant 54 mbs connection, never a dropped connection and microsoft support. I was almost tempted to get the Microsoft wireless router but this combo is working great."
5,"good value, good price,","I don't see any problem with this router. Nice look, good quality, also good price. Also easy to use and set up. If you just use internet, this is a perfect one to share internet."
4,Netgear Wireless-G Router,"I was really pleased with the router. I only use it for my personal computer, but it works really well!"
5,Perfect for the price,"I have a cable modem based internet connection that I wanted to share between two wireless laptops. This router is perfect for the price. The instructions on the installation CD are easy to follow even for someone who has never installed a router before and the entire setup takes about 20 minutes. You do not need anything beyond what is included in the box. I have been using this for more than two days now and wireless connectivity, speed and range has been excellent."
5,Works great,I had purchased another wireless router and never could get it to work. Set this one up as instructed and worked great. The range is good and the connection even seems faster. I would definitely recommend this item.
1,Awkward & undependable,"After a convoluted set-up, this unit continued to be hassle with constantly dropped signals. Eventually the WGR614 became a waypoint between the modem and my laptop which was connected with a 20' cable back to the router. Lucky I had the cable or else I would have continued to lose work! For multiple laptops and a powerful signal spend $20 more and buy a Linksys. Sorry Netgear."
1,Randomly Stops Working,"I would say this is probably the worst router I have ever owned. When I left college and moved to a new apartment I picked this up for my new home wireless network. To follow with most of the other 1 star reviews, it consistently just stops broadcasting. The lights stay on and blink and show as if it is working, but the only way to get it going again is to just reset the thing by pulling the power out and plugging it back in.On another token, I have DSL as cable is not available in my area. It took me HOURS to get this router to work properly in conjunction with my DSL modem. The directions included with the router did not end up working easily, so I had to take several additional steps which I managed to find online using my Mobile Broadband Card as secondary internet connection.All in all I would say this is an awful investment. Get another router at any cost."
2,Router WGR614v6 does not work with Bellsouth DSL modem Westell C90,"If you have a Bellsouth DSL Westell Modem with a static IP address, this router does not work. If you hire professional help (which most of us will not do) they may be able to set it up for you, however, it will not be a reliable connection. I recommend a NO BUY for this one for use with Bellsouth DSL modems (at least with the modem I have)."
2,Failure wireless router,"I bought the wireless router in 2006.09, and installed it in my home. The Router installed CD is very hard to follow and to use. It always causes failure to setup the internet connection. Before I used the router, I have normal internet connection with easy setup. Once the router is working for the wired connection, it nevers works for a wireless status. I do not recommend to purchase it."
2,Only the REALLY brave should consider Netgear,"I've spent most of the last three days trying to get a Netgear wireless home network up and running. The sad thing is that I'm a network consultant, so this should be easy. Why is Netgear making it so hard?Their Help Desk staff are apparently in a Far Eastern country. They have heavy accents that are very difficult for this Midwesterner to understand. They also seem to have some trouble understanding English. Not a good mix for a support function.I've registered, and re-registered my hardware several times, but the support reps keep telling me that it isn't registered. No registration = no support. I've called three times, and each time I've been abruptly disconnected because Netgear says my products are 'unregistered.' At least, I think that's what they're saying to me.Unless you're more of networking guru than I am, skip the Netgear product and try the Wi-Fi network offerings from Linksys and Microsoft."
1,Not worth the money,"Functions offered in the unit is minimum. Although it claims to be wi-fi compliant, it has great problem and difficulty working with other b or g product. When I inspected the package, actually there is no wi-fi certified logo. And support? Forget about it.I am happier using the Buffalo AirStation."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"This product is HORRIBLE! I'm in a 2,000 sq. ft building and never get a signal. It also drops the connection even if I'm in the same room. HORRIBLE PRODUCT!!!"
1,Avoid at all costs!!,You get what you pay for. Password protection and encryption process is a convoluted mess. Save yourself the trouble. Pay the extra and buy a Linksys or Apple router. Will never buy a Linksys product again.
2,Cheap- you get what you pay for,"Got this router to replace Linksys 802.11B. Went between this and linksys, this being $20 cheaper. Bad choice. Router looks nice, but is inconsistent- can sometimes get to setup screen, other times have to powercycle 3x for it to work. Router has actually slowed down internet (even with only one device connected) by 2/3. I get 12 mbps directly off comcast modem, and when hardwired to the netgear only get 4mbps- I can understand a small drop,but cmon! Support is no help...standard troubleshooting from india...tells me its something on my end. Never again will I buy netgear...go linksys"
1,Junk,"Hello all,I made the first mistake of buying this router from NetGear. My next mistake was not purchasing from Amazon but buying from ToshibaDirect as part of a notebook package.The router, which was offered as a high end unit, just does not work that well. Adequate but spotty. The rebate I should have received....well....I posted all rebates on 6/6/05 and received every one, Toshiba, HP, all except the NetGear. Toshiba has basically done nothing although this was purchased through their website. NetGear has done less than nothing except provide empty promises and excuses.I would strongly urge you to do the following....buy your products through Amamzon.com not ToshibaDirect. And stay away from both Toshiba and NetGear products as their customer service is horrible."
1,"Good initially, but then...","I was very happy with the product initially, but then came home from vacation to find the connection had dropped. No internet connection was possible when the router was installed. Perhaps it was due to a nearby lightning strike, but nothing else in our house had problems. In any case, the direct port use for our desktop stopped working altogether. I tried other ports but the unit was unable to get an IP. The manual is no help. Time for the trash, then off to the store for some other brand."
1,Do Not Buy if You Have SBC DSL,"Its a waste of lot's of time to try and use this product if you have SBC DSL service. No one can help despite hours of trying. Netgear's on-line help was a nightmare, particularly since the person could barely speak english and was based in Bangladesh."
4,See the light?,over all this product is a good product but if you put it in your room and you cant sleep with bright lights. this product is not for you. there is no way to turn off the lights and still have the internet still on.
2,Decent while its connected,"It appears to be a good product for some and troublesome for others. After reading the reviews I took a gamble hoping that it will work for me especially at the amazing price after rebates. Unfortunately my WGR614 had a few of the problems that others were encountering.First, using Netgear WG511 pc card and router after the initial setup the connection lasted about 3 days before I had to do my first reboot of the device. Following the next few days the connection wouldn't last from morning to evening without a reboot. Second, after disabling SSID broadcast it would still broadcast the name. Instead of waiting until it disconnects every hour on the hour like others have experienced I decided to return it. While it was connected the performance was very good with 54mbps at times, so it stated on the configuration utility. Haven't decided which router to go with next, most likely Linksys."
5,Speed is better than wired DSL,"This router installed almost automatically in the back bedroom (office) of a single story 2000 sq ft home. The companion Netgear WG511 recognized the wireless signal as soon as the CD finished the installation. I waited a long time to try wireless and have been skeptical. No longer. It works, it's fast and it's taken the mess of wires out of my family room."
1,This router Sucks!,I bought this router from Fry's Electronics for almost $100. I constantly have to reboot it and sometimes it goes striaght to netgears home page for no reason. Until recently when it stopped working all together! I didn't even have it for 6 months! I would not reccommend this router for anyone who uses a wireless connection a lot.
1,Does not last,"I bought this in March 2004. It worked great for the first couple of months. Then started to require a reboot once in a while and eventually stopped working. I called the warranty hotline, after more than an hour of trouble shooting he agreed that the product is bad and needs to be replaced. However, I was expected to pay for the shipping which was an additional $14.99. The new piece which I got worked for only a couple of weeks before going bad. I do not want to spend another $14.99 for shipping or something being sold at $30. Very bad, I would recommend buying something more reliable."
1,Total Disappointment,Had to continuously reboot router due to lost signals; Customer Support useless. Abandon Netgear and Go to Belkin which is OUTSTANDING.
1,"Easy to install, hopeless for heavy use","I bought one of these to replace an SMC7004AWBR which stopped allowing admin logins and wouldn't reset to factory defaults.It installed like a dream, was really easy to set up, and worked fine--at first. Unfortunately, I work from home as a software engineer and system admin, and really need a reliable router--and this isn't it. Once I open too many simultaneous TCP connections, it'll crash--the lights blink as if it's still working, but it stops actually routing packets.I've tried a firmware upgrade, I've tried changing the MTU size, and next I think I'm going to try another brand of router... If you use BitTorrent, RSS aggregators, or other software that opens lots of TCP connections, avoid this router. Similarly, if you have several computers in simultaneous use, this device will only frustrate you."
1,Stops working weekly,"Had a Netgear router previously and it worked great for several years. Recently I decided to purchase this model to upgrade. Well since I've had it I've had trouble. On a weekly basis (about every Fri night) my router stops working. I notice when I pick up my phone (VOIP) on the following morning that it is dead. My laptop will not even detect the router when I try to access the internet. This has been happening and it is very annoying. I've tried the suggestions on the Netgear message boards and done suggestions, but no success. I am dreading calling technical support because the last time I called several yrs ago it was offshore and talking to them was a nightmare. If anyone has had a similar problem, please share how you resolved it. My next router will not be a Netgear."
3,Cannot do VPN,"This product is easy on the eyes and the setup is effortless. However, we just couldn't get VPN to work with it.After spending several hours trying to make VPN work, we finally gave up and got a Linksys WRT54G. The Linksys is more expensive but it works.If you don't need VPN, get Netgear. If you need VPN, get something else."
2,Not Dual Voltage,"I travel alot and bought this with the intention of using it with both 110V and 220V. The problem is, it is only 110V."
2,Constant Dropped Connections,I had this router for several years in a small apartment. Had many problems with dropped connections and router needing to be power cycled. Replaced it with aLinksys-Cisco WRT54GL Wireless-G Broadband Router (Compatible with Linux)with firmware upgraded to DD-WRT which performs flawlessly. I regret spending so much time and effort trying to get the Netgear WGR614 to work reliably.
1,Always dropping us,We've owned this for too long. We're finally fed up!Pro:+Inexpensive... two-in-one+Relatively normal set up+Handled Apple and PC at the same timeCon:-Drops us constantly-Runs hotBottom line: Not recommended. Avoid.
1,Netger Wgr614 v6 troublesome,"I used this product for 18 months and had in for technical support 4-5 times because the product keeps flaking out. The last time I called, I had to pay $36 because the 90 day warranty had run out, and the problem was never resolved. Basically, I have to pitch the thing and buy a new router."
1,Do not buy,Many dropped connections for wireless. Hang for wired connection (about 2 times a week). Have to recycle the power to get it working again.
1,"unreliable, do not buy","I've had this router for about three weeks now. It hangs almost everyday, seems to hang more often when there is more network activity.The only way to recover it is to unplug the power. It's going back tothe store. Do not waste your money, pay a bit more and get a linksys."
1,"pretty on the outsite, junk on the inside","At first, everything went smoth... easy to install and configure... then on a day to day basis, after working with it for a amount of time, the connection drops and needs to be reseted every once in while. then one day i came home and found it with all the lights on, tried everything to reset it and it was impossible. I've tried calling 3 times their customer support to get a Return authorization and have waited for a period of 10-15 minutes each time, and still havent been able to talk with one of their ""engineers"".... i bought the router last october and it died now in january. Definetely not a product i would recommend."
4,Very Easy to Use,"I am very pleased with this router so far. I bought it because I was replacing a Netgear router and I thought I knew what to expect. I was happily proven wrong. This was so easy to set up. The part of the set up that took the longest was entering the security settings in the other computers. My only complaint with this is on the desktop that this is wired to, everytime I start IE, it pops up needing to enter the administator name and password, but it doesn't ask it for Firefox. I haven't taken the time to trouble shoot it yet or get a hold of Netgear to find out why it does this.Other than this one problem, I have been very happy with this router. Wireless works great and is fast."
4,A Little Old Lady In Pittsburgh Installed This by Herself,"Then I one for my sister! It works great. I am not at all technoloically inclined, and I was able to install both of these routers. I have even been able to trouble-shoot and get mine going again on the two occasions in five years when it stopped.I highly recommend."
1,was not what i wanted,it was not able to reset and i was unable to get the internet hooked up to it. wasted valuable time trying to figure it out
5,netgear,proforms greatly i never have any trouble with connection on my xbox360 or internet so i give it a five out of five
1,Junk - not worth your time or money,"This router has turned out to be a huge headache and cause of high blood pressure. Locks up every few days, DHCP server doesn't work if you alter the subnet. The ""USB drive"" feature is worthless - the security is a joke. New firmware caused more problems than it had already. Netgear won't even talk to you without first giving them your credit card number. I was going to put this worthless pile of junk on ebay, but cannot morally sell this thing to somebody. I wouldn't even give it to somebody for free, don't want to loose friends. Its hardly worthy of sharing the trash can with moldy bread. My heart goes out to anybody who bought one of these things. Save yourself the stress, throw it away; better yet- burn it, run it over with your lawnmower!"
2,Only good for basic routing,"I chose this Netgear product over other brands simply because in the past, Netgear products have always worked flawlessly. Nowadays however, Netgear's routers seem to be degrading in quality and the WGR614 is no exception. I recently purchased a version 5 and while it is good for basic routing, any complex addition to a network will cause this router to malfunction (e.g. adding a network printer).I've talked to tech support over 2 days and the only solution they can give me is that my network printer is at fault however as soon as I tried using a Linksys WRT54G, my network works as expected.If all you need is to route a couple computers together with no extra features, this product should suffice. Otherwise, look elsewhere, especially the Linksys products."
4,Worked fine for a while and then started regularly losing the DSL connection,"I stopped using this router, switching to a Belkin instead. Why? Because after a few months, I was getting disconnected from DSL connection from 1-2 times per month. That necessitated powering off and on the router, the modem, and sometimes my Mac. At times, even that didn't work the first time. Tech support was of no help.I've been using the Belkin for at least 6 months, and I've never lost the connection even once. Also, the Belkin setup is much easier than the Netgrear. And I know my experience w/Netgear is not unique.I originally gave the Netgear 4 stars 18 months ago, but now I'd make it two--just couldn't change the star rating when I edited this review."
5,Works fine,I have had mine for over a year and have had no problems what-so-ever. For those that have had problems I would like to know if you tried:1) Lowering the MTU to 14922) Lowering the fragmentation threshold to 23063) Lowering the RTS threshold to 2304I am so pleased that I ordered a second router to use as a repeater to expand my network. We'll see if my praise continues after I get the second one.
4,Netgear WGR614 54 Mbps 2.4 GHz Cable or DSL Wireless Router,"The instructions were simple, it took about twelve minutes to set up (monkeys or rats could easily be trained to do this) and has required no other attention.The wireless signal is excellent throughout the house, even on the deck, and holds right at 54.0 Mbps.Well worth forty bucks."
1,Don't buy this,"Don't get carried away by the sleek design. It worked fine for a week and then the wireless component stopped working. 2-3 times a week, the router needs to be restarted. And, after 6 months, it was permanently dead. Then, finally had to replace this router. Not sure, how long this new piece would survive. Absolutely, no - no."
3,customer service sucks,"If you get a netgear product, its best if you know networking before hand. netgears customer service is the worst i've seen. everything they tell you is on the netgear website and they don't actually do any trouble shooting. the guy acted like i was stupid and didnt listen to anything that i said. and guess what? my router still doesnt work."
3,"If you choose to buy this router, be patient","I bought this router today, because the Linksys router I had chosen was not available, and I didn't want to wait any longer. Big mistakeI inserted the CD and started the installation, and after 5 min of following all the steps, the installation was successfull. Joy and happiness. But when I started using the wireless connection, the connection between router and modem died. Shut everything down, tried again, and the ethernet connection was not working anymore. Tried to re-install the router, and then even ethernet was not working anymore. Went back to internet, read all the posts I could find, and after just 3 hours of trial and error, it is finally working. And I am usually pretty fit. So it could take longer....Also good to know, the help of the handbook is of no help."
1,This wireless router sucks,"I updated my intel(R) PRO/Wireless 3945ABG drivers on my laptop. I updated the fireware on this router. The router is sitting 3 feet away from my laptop. The signal drops whenever I download or surf the web more than 5 minutes. It's a good wired router, but not good wireless router. Avoid at all cost. Save yourself some money and buy a better router. I had linksys wrt54g with tomato 3rd party fireware on it. It's rock solid. My walls at my home are made of bricks too."
1,"dont buy, dont even buy from this company!","Cant make it work with my other wireless router, customer service has such an attitude it blew me away. All they did was screw up my entire wireless system and were completely rude!"
1,Buy something else,This router is unstable . It may be inexpensive ( I got a deal for $20 ) but it it is not worth any price . This one went back of refund and I purchased a Linksys which was east to set up with flawless performance .
1,CD Navigator has experienced a problem and must close......,"The title to this review is the error I recieve when I try to run the auto-setup from the CD. I bought this on a whim to replace my Linksys BEFSR41. I just plunked down $50 for one quality POS to replace another POS. Thats my luck, the naysayers on here have a point don't buy this unless you like having your head hurt. My hats off to the people that have had no trouble form this thing. Oh and mine was a WGR614v9"
1,Drops Connections,"This router had been working for me for 6 months with no problems, but now the router will crash and require me to pull the power and plug it back in to reset. This happens at least 5 times a day. As you can see my experience is not unique. There are major flaws with this product and contrary to the advice of Netgear a firmware upgrade will not help."
4,WGR614,This wireless router is solid & competent and easy to install. Range is good enough to function adequately anywhere in our 3 story 3600 sqft house. If we needed another wireless router I would not hesitate to by a second one.
4,Easy setup\Works great,I got this router after frying my Belkin and I had the network up and working in 10 minutes. Super easy setup and I haven't had any problems at all.
1,Piece of junk,Often just locks up. Would have to send internet requests multiple times before getting a response. Long delays - very frustrating experience. Just bought a Linksys Router (BEFSR41) to replace it - will post after some use.
4,Good product for the money,"VERY easy to set up. I did have to call tech support for some additional laptop config issues but they were very helpful with a short wait time. I have yet to have any problems with connecting wireless in any area of my house. All in all, seems to be a great basic wireless setup."
3,"great product, poor installation instructions","The product arrived with no paper ""getting started"" instructions. I eventually was able to find instructions at the website listed in fine print on the box. Not obvious. 2nd party vendor linked via amazon wasn't much help. It worked great once I got past this."
3,Works well for the price!!,"Great product. I was concerned that it would not work well since it was so cheap, but I was pleasantly surprised by its speed."
1,No Customer Support,"I bought the netgear wireless router over cheaper alternatives because of its supposed higher quality. The router, however, only gave me intermittent access to the internet. I called netgear customer support numerous times, and after long waits, I received ""solutions"" that did not fix my problem. After five (maybe more--I lost count) calls to customer support, I asked that netgear replace my defective router. Netgear then put me on hold and after fifteen minutes no one had ever come back to my call so I hung up in disgust. I definitely recommend against buying a netgear product if you think you will ever need true customer support."
2,You get what you pay for,"Just what the title says. If all you do is surf a largely static net, then this is as good a router as any & works both wired & wirelessly without problem.If, however, you do any sort of net-intensive things on any of your connected computers/devices (game online, share files, p2p, stream, etc) you are in for a terrible experience.I am one of the latter and this router now sits gathering dust waiting for my folks to get high-speed where they live since they will only have lightweight demands."
2,Good When Its Working Right,"This was the first router I bought and it was recommended by the Best Buy employee I talked to. The installation was pretty easy and for a month this router worked excellent. I had great range and it was reliable. Then one day (about a month after I bought it) my wireless internet connection didn't work. I didn't know what the problem was, but after resetting the settings, I had decent connection again. Unfortunately this problem keeps reoccuring and about once week I lose my wireless connection causing me to reset the settings each time. Its kind of annoying to be honest.Overall this is a good router when right, but outside of a month it hasn't been reliable for me. I guess I would look for an alternative router if I were you."
3,Doesn't Handle Multi-Computer Networks Well,"I purchased this router about 8 months ago. It was easy to set up and get my one computer online.My problems with this router began as I added more computers to the network. I now have 4 computers on, 3 wireless and 1 ethernet. When users on the network are sharing files, the router crashes and has to be reset.This is getting really irritating and I am looking for an enterprise router to avoid having this problem again."
4,"Functional, but requires a little expertise","I use the Netgear router with a desktop and a laptop. Getting my laptop (it is equipped with a Cisco Aironet wireless adaptor) to recognize the router was no problem at all - however, I found that my neighbors were using my net connection for free! In other words, the system defaults to NO security! I had to read through the manuals (which are very comprehensive, and context sensitive with respect to the set-up page) to set up a secure network. Though the manuals are comprehensive, they are written in an extremely technical fashion - a set-up wizard for security might have been very helpful for the average wireless user.I have been using the router for the past two weeks now, without any issues. I would recommend this product to a potential buyer - $40 for a wireless G router is a pretty sweet deal!"
1,Keeps dropping off line,"I purchased this router thinking it was one of the better ones. Boy was I wrong. Just reading these reviews it dropped off line over 8 times. I even unplugged the cordless phone to see if it would make a difference. I will try to update the firmware, but I really don't have the time to fix a ""New"" product. I will try to return to Amazon and purchase something else locally. I had better send this now that it is still up and running before it gooooeeesss........"
1,No wireless - terrible,"I've had this for a few months now, and I still cannot get the router to work when I have wireless access turned on. The techs I speak always blame the problem on someone else. This is a horrible product. You should not buy this unless you want to spend hours of great frustration only to not have it work.Garbage!"
1,Save your money,"Started out great. Easy setup, great connectivity. Recommended it to a client.Mine died. Tech Support was a joke and won't respond to my email requests. Router will not respond to the config IP address. I HAVE done this before. Router client bought is DOA.After 8 months the three year warranty is useless. With one dying in service and one DOA, I bought a Linksys and it is a dream. PLUS it is even easier to install than the Netgear. Longevity for the Linksys will be determined, but the Netgear score is a big fat zero. I don't have time to argue with a tech support technician half way around the world when it is CLEARLY a hardware problem that they don't want to acknowledge. All I want is a router that works. Two netgear routers are trash. Maybe you will get a good one, but both a V1 and V5 have failed me. Good luck, but better yet learn from my misfortune."
1,Keeps Dropping Wireless Connection,"I should have read the reviews before buying....This router (WGR614v6) keeps dropping the wireless connection. At first I thought it was my ISP, but when you try to log into Netgears administration page, you can't, even though my ipconfig tells me that I still have a valid IP.I just bought this router no more than a month ago and I am dropping connections almost every day!!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT if you are using a wireless setup...Sorry NETGEAR, but this product SUCKS!!!"
1,DON'T BUY IT!,"I just buy one of this a few days ago, I connect it and works just fine the first day, however stops working the next day. No signal of life after one single day using it.Botton line, if you want to waste your money, this the way to do it."
3,Um bom comeo,Estou no Brasil.Só compro na Amazon e sempre deu tudo certo.A entrega é imediata e sem burocracia.O produto é bom e atende às minhas necessidades.
1,Ugsnarl,Very hard to setup! I quit. Two hours with this router sent me back to the store for a return. I'm not new to computers but plug and play is what I expect in this kind of product.Good luck!
2,Installation problems out the wazzo,"the softwear provided by netgear did not do its job. i had to speak call Netgears service (which turned out to be a huge hassel). if it were not for the phone service i would not have been able to get this router connected and working, granted i am only an intermediate computer user, so i know how to get things rolling, but this softwear didnt get me anywhere.but after the half hour of being on hold the man helping me was very helpful in plunching in numbers that the softwear never suggested.it works great now that i have it hooked up, but the installation was rather exhausting."
1,Hopelessly unreliable,"I set this router up - easily, as everyone said - and the connection worked for two weeks and then started crashing. In the last two weeks I have spent more than 6 hours on the phone with netgear; none of the techs are able to stabilize the connection. Hopelessly unreliable, and no consistent support or suggestions to do anything other than fiddle with its settings. It's going back, and I would not recommensd it to anyone who actually wants to use their internet connection."
1,Poor Product: Poor Customer Service,I have a current Netgear router and thought I would buy another one. What a mistake. Product works for about 30 minutes then it freezes. Have to unplug and plug back in. Call tech support to ask for a Return Number. On hold for 45 minutes. Won't give me a Return number. Says send them an email. Attempted to send email. Email Error. Summary: Bad product; Bad support. Do NOT Buy.
4,GREAT,"This wireless router is great. The step by step instructions makes it easy for it to set-up. The signal is great, I haven't lost a internet connection yet!!"
4,Over a year and still going strong!,"Good little router, basic, but generally works well..haven't tried the WPA security on it though since my connected devices don't support it. The WEP works fine though, as does the ethernet switch component. Rarely needs a reboot, in contrast to what the other reviewers here say. But this is Version 6 of this router, there are 7 versions now according to the Netgear site..maybe the other reviewers had one of the earlier versions..?The range on this router is not great, although it's good..thus the 4 starts instead of 5.."
3,"Great form and features, terrible firmware quality - WG614V2","This is a very well designed product from the look of the box. It has many attractive features and an easy to use user interface. Initial setup is a snap. Has clear and simple instructions. However, you must know:1. It overheats, and must be placed in a cool spot.2. The firmware has some considerable issues, and upgrades are a pain. One critical issue, is that some 2.4Ghz wireless phones will not just cause interference with the signal, but will cause the router to crash, disconnect both wired and wireless ports and require a ""hard"" power off reboot. When this happens every time you get a phone call it becomes unbearable, and that is why it has gotten varied milage by people.If you buy it, go back to a 900Mhz phone...."
4,"So Far, So Good...","A couple of weeks ago, I was unable to get a Linksys 54g router and matching 54g pci card to talk to each other, so I took them back. By comparison, this Netgear 54g router and a matching Netgear 54g pci card were a snap. A firmware update took care of the inability to block SSID broadcast talked about in earlier reviews.The only problem I had as a router on my home LAN was the inability for two PCs to see each other. (They both could see the Internet.) Ten minutes on the phone with Netgear tech support tracked down the problem -- the ZoneAlarm software firewall settings on one PC.Getting a Toshiba wireless PDA to work with the router was a much bigger problem, but I'm not sure if the blame lies with Netgear or Toshiba. Their implementations of 128-bit WEP security via an ASCII passphrase differ. Once I figured this out, I used the direct hex input method and they now work well together.All-in-all I am very satisfied with this router."
2,Poor support,"I bought this unit along with two WG511 PC Cards for two machines. It was relatively easy to install and initially worked fine. After less than one day, one of the machines lost it's connection. I phoned customer support, and got through to a guy in India after waiting for approximately 1 hour on my third atttempt. He said he didn't know what was wrong and suggested that I contact Microsoft. Through searching the internet I have found that others have encountered similar problems but have not yet found a solution."
5,Excellent speed and range - 4 Minute Installation,"I installed this router in 4 minutes, literally. The router is installed on the 2nd floor and I'm using the Netgear wireless card on my laptop in the basement. The connection is great. The installation was flawless and quick. I had a D-Link wireless router and card before this and it barely worked one floor away. The price was excellent with the rebate, the total for the card and the router came to [money] (no tax and no shipping). I am completely satisfied."
4,Great router,"Pros:Works as advertised, easy to setupAllows the netmask to vary, up to 16 bitsTiny footprint, smallest router I've seen yetStylish sleek looksAllows MAC based access per machineCons:Log is simplified, not very usefulCannot distinguish UDP vs TCP when forwardingI'm not a strong believer in WEP. Someone could as realistically tap your phone as capture packets from your network. So I'm going to ignore all the WEP issues. The MAC filter is nice to prevent someone from taking a free ride on the internet tho.I've used other products such as an Apple, Linksys, and Enterasys. This router ranks well, does a good job with hardware interoperability considering 802.11g was only fairly recently adopted.The biggest minus are the logs. Netgear logs more outgoing information than incoming. It might be good for parents, but not for the techies. Even so, the logs are sparse in detail, bloated in entries, and make it nearly useless to figure out...P>Overall, great router for the price."
1,Nothing but trouble,"I've had nothing but trouble with my Netgear, and I'd suggest staying away from it.First, I bought it and a netgear wireless card for my laptop and a netgear wireless card for my second desktop. The laptop worked fine, but myself and three friends (one of whom is professor of computer science who teaches classes on networking) couldn't get the netgear card to work with the netgear router.Second, and this is an unpardonable sin, I can't play any Xbox live games through this router. I can log in and download content, but I can't get in. I have two friends with the same router, and they can't play games either. On three different games (GRAW, Gears of War, Call of Duty 3), I log in for live play and no servers ever spawn.This router is buggy and hard to work with. Avoid it."
4,Very Nice Wireless G-Router,"A nice wireless G-router. I've had it for about two years or more, and never had a problem with its performance. In fact I got one for my sister recently."
1,Have to reset every single day,"The router has to be reset every day. It will drop connections from computers and will refuse new connections, even while others are still connected. It is a constant frustrating battle to use wireless at our home. Disconnecting and reconnecting the power will usually fix things for about a day, but that's not long enough.Avoid by all means!"
4,"Great, but not ""g"" compatible with Dell TrueMobile 1300","The Netgear routers work very well and are easy to configure for both wireless connections and internet connection sharing and routing. However, this router WILL NOT CONNECT in 802.11g (54 Mbps) mode with the popular Dell TrueMobile 1300 built into many of Dell's laptops. This is confirmed by many other users on the Dell support forum.This is probably to be expected since the TrueMobile and the Netgear use different brand chipsets for this draft standard. I am giving 4-stars with the hope that this compatibility problem will be fixed with a firmware update. I hope so since this device has far better range than my previous 802.11b access port. For now, unfortunately, it will probably get returned.(note that this is with Netgear software version 1100)"
1,"Worked fine for a while, then no go. Tech support lousy.","It worked OK for about 6 months, although at one point it completely lost all the settings and I had to start from scratch to re-load them.Then it stopped working - I could talk to it through the lan port but it couldn't talk to the cable modem, never got an IP address. Tried everything under the sun, finally bought a Linksys 54 and everything works fine.Tech support was horrible - took two weeks for them to tell me I had to call in. Waited 30 minutes (twice, call was dropped first time), then they said the router was fine, I should pay for Permium service and if in the end it turned out to be hardware they'd refund the payment.So really, the warranty is only 90 days.I'd avoid this (and I guess all other Netgear products with this crazy 90-day-and-then-you-pay warranty scheme.)"
1,Netgear makes defective routers,"I ordered this router in November 2004. Opened it up and had it set up in 20 minutes. I had my laptop connected to the router wirelessly and my PC desktop connected to it through the ethernet. The setup screen was pretty simple to use. Life was wonderful...3 hours later... my connection started to drop every 5 mins. I have DSL connection but my pages were loading up as if I was using a 28.8k modem. Sometimes none of my web pages were loading at all even when I tried loading the web pages through my PC which was connected to the router directly.Anyways to make a long story short, I read the rest of the reviews on Amazon.com and Eopinions.com and realized that 90% of the users of this product are having the exact same problem with lost connections. I ended up refunding this product. I think it is terrible for Netgear to continue selling this defective product without fixing the connection problem."
1,"Terrible router, poor technical support, never again!","I've used Netgear products for many years, so when I wanted to upgrade my wireless network, I chose the WGR614. What a mistake! The wireless part of the network just stops after a period of time - when it's running G, sometimes after just a few minutes and never longer than a couple of hours. If I keep it at 802.11b only, it stays for longer, but I didn't need it for 802.11b. How annoying when at the same time, my next door neighbor's Linksys router is sending a nice clear consistent signal. I've tried to work it out with technical support. Once I got through after waiting a very long time, but email support NEVER responds, the knowledgebase is useless, and I don't want to spend my life on hold only to be hung up on again.My advice - find a different router than this one."
2,Inadequate technical support,"Installed the product. Seemed to install and work fine at first, but then discovered sensitivity to the start up and shut down sequence of machines.Have called technical support twice. Get a rude message about high call volume followed by automatically being hung up on both times.Don't buy if you really need the product to work in a reasonable timeframe."
1,WGR614,I HAD THE NETGEAR 80211B ROUTER AND UPGRADED TO THE 802.11G .I FOUND THE SIGNAL WEAKER AND UNABLE TO TRANSMITT FROM MY BASEMENT TO SECOND FLOOR.WHEN I REHOOKED UP THE 802.11B ROUTER I GET AN ADEQAUTE SIGNAL. THE ANTENNA ON THE G IS SHORTER AND NOT AS POWERFULL?
4,Seems to work fine.,"I am using my Router in an older home with lath and plaster, which I was told would hinder thr signal, but I've yet to experience any negative effects. The house is not too big and I've placed the router in a very central location and thus far it has worked like a charm."
5,Works Great; Easy Setup,"This router was easy to setup, I just ran the software on a wired in computer and it started working with my cable broadband router. An IBM 42T laptop and Dell 6000 laptop easily find the router and have excellent connections a floor away and several rooms over. The laptops also print to an HP wireless printer which set up without any problems. All of this just worked without a bunch of complicated codes or addresses being configured manually. And I have a Motorola 5.8 phone that doesn't seem to be affected by the wireless system at all."
3,Worked well for me.,"I had D-Link and Belkin routers and 1 given free from SBC. By far, this router is the best among those routers. It gives me the strongest signal and easier to config the router when compare to Belkin and SBC 1(gave that away so can't remember the brand). Once in awhile probably due the heat, the wireless signal dissapear, or wouldn't let wireless comps log in and I have to pwr it down for 10 secs and pwr back on and it worked again. Also, I found out that signal strenght is weaker as time goes by. I had it about a year now and had to reset it about 5 times. My router is on 24/7/365. I will recommend this product over G-series D-Link and Belkin router. I wouldn't recommend pcmia nor pci Netgear wireless adapters due to bad experiences. The Belkin USB 11B is much better than those Netgear even tho it had been thru as a toy for my 1 year old girl and piece of bone for my puppy."
4,Excellent Router With Robust Features,"This little router provides easy setup, a low grade firewall with Stateful Packet Inspection (SPI), and easy setup of private IP assignments and a simple way to do port forwarding. The ability to reserve an IP address for a particular computer is great if you want to set up port forwarding for services like remote access or network video cams. In Linksys routers, you have to set up a static IP on the computer itself, which can be a real pain for a computer that operates on different networks, a typical use for laptops.The system log is non-existent, however, which makes it tough to record network problems, which can be very useful when tracking DSL issues, etc. There is a log, but it is really for security as it tracks access to web sites. The D-Link DI-524 has a diagnostic log and is less expensive (although no SPI firewall).Wireless range has been excellent in the units I have used."
1,Unable to stop Wireless router from Broadcasting SSID,"Although the documentation indicates that you are able to stop the wireless network from broadcasting the SSID, the option is not available. I contacted Netgear and they agreed that this was a problem and it was going to be fixed in the next firmware release. They stated that the firmware was in the final days of testing. That was two weeks ago. The ability to stop broadcasting the SSID is a basic security feature. I would not purchase this product until the new firmware is released."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,WHAT A LOAD< BOUGHT THIS IN AUGUST TO SET UP NEW KINDLE. COMPUTER GOT VIRUS SO I HAD IT CLEANED OUT.NOW I CANNOT GET CONNECTION FOR DOWNLOADING BOOKS. CALLED TECH SUPPORT AND WAS TOLD I NEEDED TO BUY ANOTHER WARRENITYFOR 99.00dollars ! HOWS THAT GUESS I will GO TO LIBRARY TOMORROW>
1,DO NOT BUY!!,"This thing sucks! I am on my wireless connection 14 feet away and at a 39%. At even though that is horrible the worst thing is the dropped connection. I bet 30 times a day. SPEND THE MONEY AND GET SOMETHING GOOD. If I go out on my deck I get a stronger connection from someone elses router in my subdivision, and no connection from mine.Complete waste of money!"
3,Not completely without trouble,This Review covers the WGR614v1 (by now there is a v2/3 and 4 on the market as well)After upgrading the Firmware to 11.26 the router is performing stable.Con:- no firmware with WPA support to date- I am not able to achieve expected speeds downstream (upstream is fine) with a Broadcom 54G mini-PCI card - I am able to get full speed with the WG511 card in the other laptopPro:- Range is great- Did not crash once on me- Wireless connection is 100% stable (I use VPN so that is fairly important for me)
3,Works fine after a poor start,"This systems does everything I need/expected it to, however, I did have a rough start and the manual is poor. The system did not work out of the box despite trying to connect to it via both a PC and a Mac. I tried turning it on and off to no avail. The manual's trouble shooting guide said to hold the test button in for at least 10 seconds and then the unit's 'Test Light' would light and it would reset itself. Nowhere in the manual does it say where the 'test light' is and I never saw anything light despite holding the button for 30 seconds or more. Also, this didn't do anything. Nothing changed and the system still wasn't seen by my computers.I then tried my own thing which wasn't in the manual. I pulled the power and held the test button in while putting power back on. That evidently did something as a bunch of lights started flashing and after it settled down, it worked fine with both the Mac and PC.Anyway, the manual seems out of sync with the actual hardware."
2,Looks nice.... but not great.,I own a wired router and wanted a new one so I said why not get a wireless one? I got the Netgear and It was easy to set up but the signal is horrible. I am on the second floor and getting very poor signal. Also with the computers that I had hooked up with the wired feature was also slow. It is a OK router for a small home. If you want to bridge routers DO NOT BUY THIS!!
1,Horrible setup and terrible DHCP performance,"Unlike many routers this one doesn't allow you to navigate to 192.168.1.1 and punch in your important info. Instead, this router wants you to navigate to routerlogin.[net] or somesuch nonsense. But that's not what drove me bonkers. The insurmountably erratic wireless performance is what drove me bonkers. I tried for a couple of days and returned it. I had this same problem with another of these routers but wrote the badness off to microwave towers in the area - that's not the problem. It's just a crummy router. I went with the Linksys which set up in 5 minutes and has worked flawlessly."
1,Completely Unreliable,"This router is unreliable and temperamental. It goes out at least 4 times a week. Sometimes it goes out multiple times in one evening. It is, again, unreliable and has to be reset far too many times to have paid so much and for it to be so slow. It should work much better than it does. I am not happy with this tiem and will never buy a Netgear product ever again."
1,Piece of crap if used for home networking,My cable company give me this crappy router for free. It is nice at first allow my desktop and laptop to connect to the internet no problem.However when I connect from my laptop to my desktop PC and try to transfer a file over 100mb It says lost stream half way through it.I hooked up my old Linksys WRT54G v.1.1 no problem. I replace it due to resetting it seem to have been a bad power cable. I am using the power cable from the Netgear on my Linksys and no issues resetting.
1,worst consumer router ever,"I am an IT professional with 20 years experience. I've owned dozens of consumer routers, including 3 WGR614s. (Long story why I bought three routers that suck but beyond the scope of this review.) I've owned products from Linksys, other Netgear models, D-Link, Buffalo, and many others.It is, without a doubt, the single worst consumer-oriented networking product I have purchased to date. Performance is terrible, configuration is problematic, it is nearly impossible to make it work as configured for modestly ""advanced"" requirements (e.g. port forwarding). And it constantly drops wireless connections (with optimal placement and configuration where other wifi routers shine). It just completely sucks. Avoid at all costs.Virtually any other modern wireless router should easily be better. Lately it has been hard to go wrong with D-Link."
1,try some other router,"This router worked well only for 1year. Then, it always droped connection even if the router was placed next to my computer. I had to reboot this router every 2 hours. Finally I gave up and just ordered another brand."
5,Solved all issues that I had with other router brands,I used to have this connection issue where any wireless computer would drop randomly from the internet and eventually require me to reset the connection multiple times per session. There is no problem of that kind with this router and it is so relieving. I went through 3 brands and I'm glad I finally got this one! Setup was as simple as can be too.
2,Had enough of my WGR614v7,"I've had this router for a little over a year, and in that time I've had to call for support at least 5 times and go online to try to fix it myself at least twice. This thing has a mind of its own--for weeks at a time everything will be fine, but then one day it decides not to acknowledge the password I entered for it. It's caused me no end of aggravation, and I've sworn that the next time this piece of junk misfunctions, I'm tossing it and getting a different router. I'll never buy another Netgear product."
2,Broke just out of warranty,"I purchased this router, had no trouble setting it up, and no trouble using it for the first year, during the warranty period. Unfortunately, it stopped suddenly stopped working correctly just a few months after the warranty ended.It was fine while it worked, but I'm not at all impressed by the reliability. Save your money and buy a more reliable router, unless you want to buy a new router every year and a half."
1,lemon,"I think I got a lemon. Used the installation CD, hooked everything up properly...""Router not responding"". CD suggested I disable my firewall and antivirus, and try again. Did that. Same ""router not responding"" result.I'm not a technical illiterate. But this is my first experience with a wireless router, and I have no idea how to do a manual install. I'm in no mood to deal with offshore tech support. This is being returned. Guess I'll try a Linksys next...(Sigh)"
2,lasted little over 2 years,"never really happy with this unit. Constantly disconnecting, connecting etc. It got really bad to the point that it would not see my network at all for days at a time. Verizon tech support confirmed it was the router and not modem or lines.Put in a Belkin today, much easier to install and so far so good. Will give the Belkin a review once it passes the reliability test.."
2,"Don't buy it, just spend a little more money and get one that doesn't mess up your internet connection.","If you have Clear as your internet provider don't even bother buying this. It will mess up your connection within a week, it works for like thirty minutes and it will stall after that. It literally took twenty minutes to log me into facebook. Just spend a little more money on a higher tech version."
1,unreliable,"Bought this on another store... Didn't use it right because of a free one given by internet provider. Have to use it when i moved to another house. Like other reviewers suffered drop connections ever so often, like other reviewers called tech support and was told it can be fix easily if i pay $69. So went to buy a wireless n router for cheaper and a promise not to buy any netgear product ever."
5,works great,i didn't have any problems with it even though i got a refurbished one and i thought i might.
5,Great Router,This is my third Netgear router and once setup properly all have worked flawlessly. Setup on my iMac required a call to Netgear where the technician was very friendly. For some reason the router was not picking up the IP address but once it was entered by hand the rest of the setup including the security setup went fast.
4,Router,For what we need it for it is great. We have had no problems so far but I feel we are not really stressing it enough to give an accurate review.
4,Does its job,This was recommended to me by some people that had bought it and researched a lot of different routers. I think my only complaint is if you are using a computer and another device drawing from the internet then is is a little slow but I blame this more on my slower internet connection through my phone company.
2,"Think twice, mac users","For PC users, this baby works great.For mac-only users, it's not that bad.However, it really disappointed we bootcamp users..."
5,Easy setup and good signal,"I was very tentitive about setting up a wireless network and I stressed over the equipment compatibility issues. I have 3 Windows PCs in the house and a laptop, all at different stages of life and configuration. The receivers are all different and all work to my satisfaction. I am not a very demanding user, (no games or streaming video so far) and I am very pleased with the purchase."
4,not perfect,"At first the setup was kind of easy, i just the Cd. Connection worked fine for some hours(wired and wireless), then the web pages stop loading, with the exception of my home page, and msn messenger that still sign in.I try different configurations and nothing worked, then i decide to format my pc, and it was worth it. Since then the router has been working perfectly both wired and wireless."
1,Signal Drops -->so often it's almost unusable,"I carefully researched my new wireless home network, read all the reviews, talked to IT friends, and settled on the Netgear ""G"" product. It has an attractive industrial design, was moderately easy to set up, and was priced well on Amazon.com. After using it a short time though I am totally frustrated!! The signal drops off with great regularity. All the lights indicate it is still working fine, and my hard wire connection to the cable modem works great, but no signal emits from the wireless router. I thought, maybe it needs an updated software patch. After downloading the latest driver from Netgear, it still does the same ... thing! You have to power it down and restart it to get it to work again. The signal it does put out is so weak it's impossible to get a clean enough signal to enable 128bit encryption. (I'm only trying to span 30ft). I don't know if this is the best you can expect from wireless networking, but I'm not impressed."
3,A good airplane read,"The author enthusiastically (perhaps too much so) the hard working appetites of the pioneers. I mush enjoyed the descriptions of the ""stick to your ribs"" food enjoyed by many cultures comming together on the frontier. However, the bulk of the book seemed to be made of depictions of feasts and picnics, rather than everyday fare. There was some material on the origin of the various dishes (for example, the ""Boilermaker"" with its origins in the ""Sean O'Farrell""), but not enough for my tastes. For those searching for the origin of common dietary staples, I would instead recommend ""The Potaro""."
2,"Seems to have changed formula, more brittle now","I used this Pro Supex Blue Gear 17 as the Mains on my hybrid setup. I had a 660' roll of the natural color. The original roll had no issues when I strung it in a Head Metallix 4. After I finally ran out of the natural color Pro Supex Blue Gear 17, I ordered this blue color reel. It should be identical?? to the natural.What I found is that the blue color is more brittle than the natural color string and on 6 failed attempts to string the Head Metallix 4, the blue string broke at the same point (most severe ~130 degree turn at the throat of the racquet) on three different racquets. I tried using tubing but that broke too during the stringing. I am experimenting with replacements for the Mains. Right now I am testing (and liking) the Pro Supex Ultra Spin. It strings up with no issues and has a nice feel on the court."
3,Nothing Special with Overused Stereotypes,"This book was not outstanding. I'm not saying it was bad, I was just unimpressed. I admit that I saw the movie Felicia's Journey and was expecting something whacky and was suprised otherwise. American pop culture is filled with references of bad nannies and young Jezebelles. Unfortunately, this book doesn't overcome the usual stereotypes in the horror genre, and the plot ends as you'd expect it. Maybe I was supposed to get involved in the main character's life -- an unambitious man who can't learn to fall in love. All in all, this book was nothing special and I can't recommend it as good."
2,"overrated, but interesting",Very confusing to read a stream of consciousness of more than one person. Streams leading to a lot of confusion. I was led to read this book by the review in NY Time. Only good thing for me was to get a taste of this writer who I guess is well known in England.
1,Dull story combined with bland characters,"This book is just another version of a well-worn and highly overused story. However, this did not doom the book, which could have been salvageable had the story been written in an engrossing manner and the ending be dramatic. Unfortunately this was not the case and instead the reader is subjected to characters as lively as cardboard boxes, meandering along until the flat ending is reached. The only exception is the mother-in-law character, whose obnoxious, haughty manner does stand out well. We can almost understand why the villianess does hate her so much. This, and a inane sub-plot having nothing to do with the main story are the only things that stand out. Mercifully, this book is very short."
2,So so,"Nothing's really great about the story, although it has some surprising elements. The language is quite cumbersome, with lengthy sentences. It might be appealing to some readers, but not exactly me. Ever feel like you're dragging yourself to endure something? That's how I feel trying to complete reading the book."
3,short-lived compassion,"""Two Lives"" made me a William Trevor fan. I will soon find another book by him, now that I've read ""Death in Summer."" With ""Death in Summer"" he again displays his remarkable ability to present troubled or otherwise less-than-perfect characters with consideration and extraordinary compassion and to make fairly ordinary characters compelling. I don't know how he does it, but the prose is beautiful. What disappointed me about this book is that it dealt with the idea of compassion, but didn't explore the challenge of maintaining compassion for a difficult person over the long term. The most difficult characters die off far too quickly, and to me, that is a plot device often used in more melodramatic works. I also did not take a liking to the use of the household servants to present the story--I never became attached to these characters. I recommend this book, but much prefer ""Two Lives."""
3,Corel Drawings,"I bought Corel Drawings Pro edition about 8 months ago expecting to be able to do actual digitizing. Basically all you can do is Draw a picture and the software automatically turns it into stitches. That is a great feature but if you need to digitize things in a specific direction or order, your out of luck. You can't import other Emb designs. You cant resequence parts to run in a different order. Theres are no cut, copy, or paste functions. The lettering is ok but if you want it to sew center out the end result looks terrible (basically starts at center, sews a line to one side and then sews from left to right.) Although this software is well suited for beginners who wish to sew only flat embroidery, The features are pretty elementery for people who demand professional results."
1,Drawing not worth the money,"I purchased Drawings 3 months ago and still cannot make it produce nice embroidery results. I have 10 years of digiting experience. The tool is plauged with subtle bugs which make it time consuming to use. You basically get a pretty simulation of the embroidery on the screen, but when you sew it out, the results look horrible. After many experiements I tracked the poor result to the stitich length. Drawing sets it to 2.9mm, my known good design have a stitich length of 6.0mm. This cannot be changed in the standard edition. So if you buy this expect to pay another $800 for the pro edition so you can actually sew something."
4,the voice of Iran,"Long before the mullahs seized power there was Googoosh.Googoosh is an Iranian singer and actress. She is known for her contributions to Iranian pop music, but she also starred in a variety of movies from the 1950s to the 1970s.She achieved the peak of her fame and success towards the end of the 1970s. Her overall impact and contributions to Middle Eastern and Central Asian pop-music earned her the title of the most iconic female pop-singer from those regions.Due to her great talents and overall endearment to her people, she is a symbol of national pride to the Iranian people. After the mullahs took over in 1979, she is famously known for remaining in Iran until 2000 and not performing again due to the ban on female singers. Still, her following has grown. Younger people have rediscovered her music via you tube and bootleg recordings. This collection is one of many and offers samples from along career."
5,"Googoosh, ""The Iranian Diva""",Googoosh's incredible velvety voice brings back so many beautiful memories. She is a Legend. Highly recommend this CD.
3,Not a bad bag for light travelers,"I bought this bag to hold a Sony DCTRV103 handycam. It has two velcro-fastened, padded dividers inside, but the camera takes up the entire space, so I have no use for them. I also carry the camera's power adaptor and AC cable, it's remote control, a couple of tapes, a 12-foot extension cord, and a handheld audio cassette recorder with is power adaptor. All this puts some strain on the bag's stitching, and it even did some small damage to the outer pocket zipper. All in all, it's a good bag, but its probably meant more for the DV-type camcorders, because they are a somewhat smaller than the Sony Handicam Hi8 series. Just make sure that everything you think you might need to carry for a shoot will fit comfortably, meaning without scratching or having to force zippers closed."
1,Disappointed,"Some facts: (1) the paperback has 154 pages - large type and double spaced. (2) Pages 127 - 147 deal with the author's life, education and pilot training/service and have nothing to do with UFOs at Roswell. (3) a significant portion of the book is composed of conversations that the Shirkey 'invented'. Quoting Shirkey on page 19 [""The author, who did not witness these conversations among various officers, composed the narration...Military personnel will recognise that the dialogue could be true based on the actions taken and the results.""]. As far as I can tell, the title of the book, ""I Was There"", only applies to him standing at the Operations Desk of the Roswell Air Field with Colonel Blanchard while some men walked past with cardboard boxes of [""aluminum-looking metal pieces""] and then onto a B-29 aircraft. Don't get me wrong - anything that adds to our knowledge of what happened in 1947 at Roswell is great, but this book adds very little of substance."
1,old stuff,"The author has not many new things to say about the Roswell incident ! To ""have been there"" is not enough to make a good book. Very quickly read and deeply disapointing. I'd better keep my money for something else !"
1,Too much for young readers,"Since the release of the Scooby Doo movie my 3 year old daughter loves the familar brown pooch. I bought this book for me to read to her, thinking ""what was the harm?"" What I didn't realize was, that in this book there is no man in a mask upset at some meddling kids. There really are witches, spell books and real ghosts. I also think it is way too soon to start teaching children about the wiccan religion.(which it mentions by name). I never thought I would say this about Scooby, but this one is too intense for me and my kids."
3,The Old Order Amish in plain words and pictures,"large saddle-stitched paper back, appears to have been produced for tourists hence may be on the exploitative side; but still a decent brief overview of the Amish people and culture. Contains numerous color photographs, some of which, however, are close-ups of members of the community. Text appears to be no more than three thousand words."
4,Good Intro to Earlier Science Fiction,"Good assortment of science fiction topics. Was especially useful exposure to some the giants in the field, who's work is well worth reading, but who aren't currently popular. Also interesting to read earlier treatments of sci-fi topics - alternate history, alien encounters, collapse of civilization. Agree with other reviewers that the stories have a strong literary bent, but not excessive."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this book. I was expecting to get a book about how to ""create creatures of fantasy and imagination"" Instead I received a book with really bad drawings of people with butterfly wings on them, and animals put together with other animals, such as a housecat with bird wings(?) Just my personal opinion, but not at all what I was looking for."
1,Very poor work...,"I was very disappointed in this book. The figures are clumsy and badly painted. Many of the paintings are down-right ugly, and the artist seems to have a problem with body proportions. And despite the title, her ""Creatures of Fantasy"" are just pictures of regular people with wings stuck on them or spots painted over their faces. There is no attempt to create more imaginative design.I like many of her other books, and thoroughly recommend her books on textures and buildings, but I think she is out of her comfort zone here.I would recommend Draw & Paint the Realm of Faerie, by Ed Org, instead."
3,"Product OK, vendor dubious.","The product is as I expected, the surprise came in the shipping and handling fees amounting tomore than half of the product price, something that wasn't made known at the time I placed the order.Only later did I get a receipt indicating this. When I tried to cancel the order I was told they couldn't find it.It was picked up from them by UPS for shipment the next day, and I was out the $$. I could have bought it locallycheaper. Needless to say, if I see the vendor's name again, I'll order it elsewhere!"
1,Irresponsible seller,I bought 50pcs of the tape but only received 48pcs delivered. The white tapes come with black spots for most of that 48pcs. Very irresponsible of the seller. I don't find it will be economical to return the product given the fact I reside in Singapore and have to pay for return handling on my own.
5,Amazon is the best !,"Difficult product to find and Amazon had it... Excellent DVD collection for any cinephile - a ""must-have"". As always, Amazon delivered promptly, regardless of being out of the U.S. and the package arrived just as shown. Amazon is the best!"
4,Chaplin Collection One,"Simply the best looking, best sounding, fully packed version of Chaplin features ever released. To be honest, the packaging could have been a bit more sturdy. I bought a used copy of this set (all discs play fine)which had small tears and wrinkles in the outer box. I added some 11 mil cardboard and some rubber cement to reinforce and protect the set. It worked fine - but I shouldn't have needed to do it. Also, I do have a problem with the transitions in The Great Dictator. Every time there is a fade or dissolve you can see a couple frames from what are apparently lesser film sources. I wish they would have ""dissolved"" them out instead of cutting. Still - these are huge improvements over earlier VHS offerings which must have been copied from 16mm prints."
5,Masterpieces,"These are masterpieces but must be sipped slowly, like fine wine. The dated technology makes these works seem trite if taken in huge gulps."
4,Great gift,I really like this toy. The hammer is real sized and the other tools are very nice...they look like the real thing. The only down is that there were not very many pieces to the set. The kids argue over the pieces...it would be nice if there were more nuts and screws and bolts to go around. But it is a good toy.
5,Fabulous for Kids,"Very happy with this set. Look and feel real, but are safe for toddlers and hold up unbelievably well."
4,Little Workers,This is a Christmas gift for my 2 1/2 year old son. He hasent got to play with is yet but I am sure he will love it because he loves all kinds of tools.
4,A good shoe,"But I prefer the Skechers D'Lites. I'm a nurse and on my feet all day at work. These shoes stood up to the abuse, but the back 'shoe horn spot' was very bendy and didn't provide much back of the ankle support and made the shoes difficult to put on at times. The color was great and perfect for the new uniform requirements for my job."
4,Needs better media,"I bought this book with CD and DVD because to a novice such as myself it is difficult to imagine what music is supposed to sound like. So I wanted to have a reference that I could check to make sure I am playing correctly. Some of the the exercises were placed on a DVD instead of the CD, which complicates things slightly, I would have preferred to have each exercises as a separate CD track."
5,Guitar Method Book,Great book for beginners. Has easy to follow diagrams and practice exercises for each of the notes and chords. Recommend to anyone who wants to self teach themselves versus going to a guitar instructor.
5,Great Starter Book,This is a good beginners book. my 9 year old daughter picked up on it after half an hour of practicing and was able to play without looking at her fingers. Highly recommended for the enthusiastic & dedicated beginner!
5,Excellent!,"I've started several attempts to get into learning guitar (books, CD's, DVD's), but this is the first that I felt had enough practice material to reinforce the concepts learned. It presents new things in bite-sized pieces, and it works for me. It is logically laid out and works well, especially the edition with the DVD, for the self-learner. I highly recommend it."
1,Don't waste your money.,"The motor on this device makes a lot of noise and barely blows any air. I get much better results using a ""quick dry"" top coat on my polish or if you are really in a hurry, just use your blowdryer."
4,Good Product,"I haven't used it yet, but have high expectations and want to take my time before I move forward. Excited!!"
1,"No ""Shield""","The reason I bought this dvd was because it was compared to The Shield. NOt a chance. Aside from the very corny storyline (first two hours anyway), even though it was in English (somewhat) it was very hard to undersand. And there was no close caption.. I suffered through almost two hours and then just had to stop watching. I dont know whose idea it was to compare it to the Shield, but to me this was a total waste of $41.00."
1,Cheesey/Poorly Acted/Low Budget/Boring,"This is NOT like The Shield at all. Blue Murder is hokey and dated with a very low budget feel. The dialect/language is hard to understand and the action is mostly non-existent. I understand the dynamic relationship these two men had but I don't care. Neither are very interesting and the show as a whole - which has been resurrected because of the BRILLIANCE of The Shield - is a poor and cheap comparison. I know the creator of The Shield said he got many ideas from Blue Murder but quite frankly he does a much better job with those ideas than the original series. Blue Murder lacks charisma, and interesting characters. One reason I am upset about Blue Murder is that it is VERY expensive to get here in the USA and the show just wasn't up to par compared to normal US television. It is hard to describe the show if you haven't seen it but it's almost has a soap opera or stage play feel to it and it is tediously boring."
5,An awesome grab-bag of info!,This is another one of those books you want to keep out for visitors to find. There's something in it for everyone -- the subjects of the lists are so diverse there's no escaping interest!
2,"It's O.K., but not worth the money.","This is a book of lists; there is no details behind anything, no extra information. Many of the chosen topics are very interesting and are great to share with friends (especially if your friends are semi-intelligent fifteen year olds, like mine).But, the book is short and your jollys end quickly. Because of the lack of background material provided, it doesn't really help if you want to refrence it for an essay or project.You could also easily research some of these things in about an hour, and it would all cost you signifacantly less than the $10-12 this book usually sells for."
3,Not many details,Interesting but like the title says it's a book of lists so don't expect detailed info of every listing. It will take personal research to get more info.
2,"Okay, but the Internet beats it","ten years ago, this would have been a 4 star book, but you can sit down to Google and have all this and much more faster and in much greater depth. It's a good toilet tank book, but that's about it."
2,"Gummy, sticky not as good as the product it replaces",I used to buy this or a very similar product with the same mfg and name in a purple tube and I liked it very well for adding height to my fine hair. That doesn't seem to be available anymore. This version has a different consistency and does not leave hair as manageable. Gave the bottles I purchased away to friends. Not sure how they liked it.
3,rented movie,It wasn't a bad movie but it wasn't GREAT either. A few times I thought the movie put stress on things that would matter later in the movie and nothing ever came of it?? I wouldn't add it to the keepers in my collection.
2,Boring,"I found nothing funny or inspiring about this movie. The characters were very boring people, and I can't remember if I even finished watching it."
2,Bad acting ruined a decent story,"The bad, overacting by the female lead was so ridiculous and unbelievable that we barely made it through this movie. The rest of the cast weren't much better, but she was in a league of her own when it came to how incredibly bad she was. We are talking cringe-inducing bad. When it was over, we just looked at each other and talked about how on earth it got past production. The bummer part is with some decent and believable acting/dialogue, it could have been a decent movie because the story was interesting.And curiousity question, what was with everyone having the same ultra-blue/green eyes?"
4,Pleasant enough movie,"Somewhat predictable boy meets girl plot, but with enough different twists to at least hold my interest for the whole movie. And I must say, I felt fuzzy inside when it ended, so good for your endorphins!"
5,Totally refreshing!,"How delightful to see a film that was all story and character driven without the techno stuff of today. Margaret Whitton's directing and decisions in telling the story harkened back to the days of real film-making and I can only imagine how happy Joe Coomer, the book's author, is that the film equalled his amazing book. I fell in love with every character both two and four-footed all over again. Special highlights are also seeing some of the film world's best character actors together on one screen and to walk out realizing that there still are films made that parents can share with their children and together experience hope and love by celebrating the joys in a person's idiosyncrasies without the any violence or foul language. Bravo to all involved and thanks for restoring my love of great stories on celluloid."
1,Song List,"I""m wondering what's the song list for this dvd ? it needs to be posted,without this important information i won't buy this item...."
1,Poor quallity video and same as Live in Reno witch is a better video quality,"Poor video quality compare to the same Live dvd from Reno, i had to sell it because there was no need to keep this one."
1,his voice is not good music isn't either!,the DVD isn't good at all! his voice is awful and the music isn't very good. if i were to buy another one i'd go for one that he did in his younger days.
5,gordon lightfoot greatest hits live,"the most prolific singer/songwriter of our generation in my humble opinion. I was overjoyed to receive this coveted dvd. thank you AMAZON you are the best. condition was great ,arrived on time ,no problems, would gladly order from them again. thank for your time."
5,gordon lightfoot,I grew up on his music on long road trips with my parents. I love horrorcore music and other extreme rap but i still love the music i grew up on.
2,Gordon Lightfoot Live DVD,I recently purchased this DVD along with Gordon Lightfoot Live in Reno. It is exactly the same as the Reno DVD. I didn't need to buy both. Your customers should be aware of this. The Reno DVD is dearer but better quality.
1,Misleading and inferior,"I just bought this DVD. There is NO indication that it is exactly the same as the Live in Reno DVD! This DVD seems to be of lower quality, too, which surprises me because it is a European import. So save your money on this one. I will be attempting to return this to Amazon (wishing myself good luck)."
5,Live At Last!,"Since the early 7ties Gordon has been on my 'Most Wanted Ones To Watch Live"" list. Living in Belgium didn't make that one easy :-) I'm quite sure he never came over here. In the Sundow days most artist didn't. Now the ""Rock Werchter"" 3 day rockfest is voted as ""World's Best"". Things change, that's for sure. So did Gordon. ""Ooh doesn't he look old"" was my first reaction watching this Reno concert.A look in the mirror kept the shock away, so I watched G. and the band play. This DVD is more than I thought it would be. I've seen a great writer and performer, handling his great songs with the love and respect they deserve! Always Good, sometimes Fantastic! Thanks Gord, it's Cold On The Shoulder and I love it!"
5,A Tightrope Walk,"The most challenging issue in healthcare has ever been a tightrope walk: How to optimize care quality while reducing care costs at the same time. The contributors of ""Knowledge media in healthcare"" address this growing information problem, while focussing on these two conflicting objectives. Technical innovations may lead to better care, to less costs, or to both, which would be a common ideal. The publication brings to light the most important aspects of the problems of the past and the innovations the future will bring, while giving us a broad view on the current status quo."
2,Moore should have included a glossary of terms!,"I love reading journals whether fictional or not. The problem with Moore's One Last Look is that it is chock full of terms and phrases, colloquialisms and innuendos from 1838 India. I wasn't there so I don't know what half the characters are talking about. What a shame! Moore would have served her readers well with a glossary and/or better explanation of what the heck she's trying to say. Indeed, as Anne Tyler quipped ""Moore is in possession of her own unique voice."" And in her possession her voice will remain!"
2,I do not get it!!,"I was very excited when our bookclub selected Susanna Moore's One Last Look for the January selection - I bought the hard back and settled in for a good read....boy, was I disappointed. The language makes this book no fun to read and thus a really frustrating way to pass a winter evening. Many other writers have given us diaries based on letters which offer the reader real insight into a specific time and events. Sadly, this book left me with nothing more than the feeling I should buy a better dictionary."
5,Best Bicycle Mag...Ever,"What first may appear as a pricey subscription, is well worth the dollars. They ship this British magazine so well, it always shows up in perfect condition. This publication covers everything about cycling; not just racing, but touring, commuting, equipment, accessories, technique and nutrition and health aspects of riding more comfortably and succesfully, no matter what your level of fitness currently is. The hassles that the Brits deal with concerning traffic, local and national laws, and how the country and culture is resolving commuters taking their bikes on trains are also included each month. It provides a fascinating look at European views and even includes detailed maps and route descriptions, should you ever hope to make it over there to ride. Great publication!"
3,brain storming,"Good for brain storming and improveing your intuition, but there are other books that cover the same thing. I wish it would go into more detail on deeper esotaric meanings and the romantic aspect of the cards,but the book was ok if you can get it at a low price."
5,Great Short Story Too,"This book was obviously written to be a suplement to the Shadowrun RPG. However, it also has an amazing short story at the end that makes this worth picking up if you are a sci fi fan. And considering the used price it won't cost you much either."
4,Nine years and a lifetime ago,"I know nothing of Shadowrun, and I don't play RPGs, but this is still a fascinating book. Published in 1991, it's the sourcebook for a cyberpunk universe, but it's more interesting as an extremely dated, nostalgic cultural artifact, a reminder of a time, not so long ago, when the future seemed a lot more futuristic. Amongst the primitive Amiga-ed CGI and 'System Shock'-esque descriptions of 'Black IC', 'decks' and 'frames' is the sense that people once thought the internet would be more than just a home-shopping network, the sense that Japan would inevitably dominate the business world, and the sense that, in the future, people would have dreadlocks and wear thin, slitted sunglasses."
3,Not a bad battery.,"I ordered this as an extra battery for my camera. It doesn't hold a charge for as long as I'd like, but it's a nice extra battery."
2,Meh. You get what you pay for.,"I wouldn't recommend this battery. It worked well the first few times, but no longer holds a charge. Even when it did, it was really only good for no more than 2 hours with intermittent video recording and photos. My OEM battery at least lasts longer. Save your money."
5,"As an intreted in History and as serious railfan, great book","Is very interesting when some one out of your country writes about things that you really finds unimportatn for much of the people. I love my country, and as aserious railfan, I love the history that ivolves the railroad and Mexico. Mr. Signor and Mr. Kirchner takes the time to write about one of the most importatn railroads of Mexico, the ""Ferrocarril del Pacifico"". They make history, because from that old subsidiary of the Southern Pacific, emerges the Sinaloa, Sonora and Baja California divisons of the Ferrocarril Mexicano. Gives you the enough information to understand the importance of this line not only for U.S. as well as Mexico. Provides also technical and historic iformation, very dificult to find by ther way."
3,Disturbing to the extremes,"I found this book to be extremely unsettling, but at the same time engrossing. The story about all the children who die made me sick, but at the same time made me read on. Anyone who reads this will undoubtably have mental problems later on in life, including me unfortunately. I would not recomend this book for anyone who does not appreciate morbid humor."
5,A delicious collection of Gorey's dark and twisted humor.,"I was introduced to this book by a friend of mine whose sense of humor is almost as twisted as that of Gorey himself. He delighted in sharing with me ""The Gashlycrumb Tinies"" (in which small children meet their doom in alphabetical order) and ""The Curious Sofa: a pornographic tale"" (in which Gorey lays sexual innuendo so thick that it becomes absurd and absolutely hilarious). After wresting the book from the aforementioned friend's hands, I read the rest of it. To my delight I found morbid limericks and quatrains, stories apparently composed of random sentences, and tales of tales of mishap and tragedy--each accompanied by illustrations in Gorey's macabre style. I would recommend this collection to anyone who has outgrown Dr. Seuss but still wants to look at the pictures.An incautions young lady named VennWas seen with the wrong sort of menShe vanished one dayBut the following MayHer legs were retreived from a Fen"
3,Brilliant ideas spoiled by tiny pictures,"The books in this series (Amphigorey Also, Amphigorey Too and this one) benefit from the warped wit of Gorey, but the size of the images is so small that it becomes difficult to make out the fine details. I like to read them to my kids (ages 9 and 12) but we have to be all scrunched together to make out the visuals."
1,Horrible,One of the worst sports books I have read. Insulting to anyone who is a hockey fan over the age of 10. Written at an elementary school level. Incredibly dated. Highlights the lowlifes and scumbags of the hockey world in an attempt to spice up a sport that doesn't need it.
5,"""The Must For Your Collection Affair""","I don't think I can add much more to the praise, but here goes. The three 2-disc collections (along with a 4th single disc) are a must for any lover of The Man From UNCLE, TV spy shows, or television in general. As other reviewers have noted, there have been many, many, previous incarnations of the UNCLE music. At last, the real deal! The music is fabulous and the liner notes and photos are great. Don't have regrets later. Pick up all 4 collections. Special thanks to Jon Burlingame for the work he put into these sets. And believe me, he put a lot of work and time into this project."
4,Good summaries of world-famous myths,"A very solid introduction for youngsters into the weird and wonderful world of ancient mythologies. Unlike some, I do not personally believe that the ancient mysteries were superior in any way to the love of Christ. I do enjoy the stories and morals of the stories though. Brett Pedersen"
3,Great BUT.....cover is NOT removable!,"I bought this for $15 on sale at Amazon and was very pleasantly surrpised. Great size, very fluffy, and compared to similar items priced 3x-4x's more at a local pet store. The problem came when I tried to unzip it to be washed...the cover is SEWN TOGETHER to the cushion inside and CANNOT be removed. It's to big to throw in the washing machine. Would have been a terrific buy if the cover was actually removable as claimed but it's NOT."
4,Good value.,"My dog really seems to like this bed. The filling seems comfy, but is not the highest quality available on the market (but for the price its a good value). The only thing I don't like about it is that the cover can not be removed for washing. Instructions say ""spot clean only""."
5,Really NICE!!!,I am very impressed with this dog bed. It is very thick and has extra padding. The cover DOES come off for cleaning. The zipper is well hidden. The bed is also very in style for those hip puppies :D
