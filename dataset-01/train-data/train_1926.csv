2,Don't Ever Again,"To be honest with you, the actual credibilty of the contendors seems to have lost a bit of its luster lately. A lot of the original victors, Fantasia Burrino, Ruben Studdard, and lay Aiken, have all released records within the past year, that really haven't been able to soar in sales. Although it is unfortunate, it seems to me that the image isn't really as interesting anymore. That also can be said for Kelly Clarkson. Her latest single has also showed the aging idol stigma too. Never Again, her first single from her third album My December, seems to try to recapture the hard edgey vibe that she was able to carry well with her previous hits, Walk Away and Since You've Been Gone. Unfortunately, it just doesn't catch on very well. It really seems tiring after awhile. I think she needs to try something different to get back on track, otherwise don't again do the same kind of songs.Song: D+"
2,Too Narrow for Most Remotes!,"I ordered this one along with a couple of other designs. Not all remotes will fit into this thing. I keep this one in my home office to hold some lesser used remotes. I was disappointed with the different designs I'd ordered, so I broke down and built my own in my workshop. This one gets two stars because it only fits thin and narrow remotes."
1,Poor quality,"This organizer is just cheaply made. And, it's not very good for holding remotes. I have five remotes, but one of them I use all the time so I thought a holder for four would be a good idea. One of my remotes is pretty small. It's the only one that fits well into this organizer. It's not very convenient to use. And that's supposed to be the reason you're buying this kind of a product."
3,Pro/Cons,We have a surround system that comes with a longer remote and it fit but stuck out of the holder a decent amount. Although it is very sturdy!
1,Not worth the money,This organizer is not sized properly and most of my remotes didn't fit in the slots. It is also heavy and not very attractive
3,Good Product But it Came Broken,This product is really good. Fits almost all remotes. However the wooden ball on the top of it was smashed into 5 pieces when I recieved it.
4,Better than expected.,"St. Clair has several box sets on the market, and we've owned a few before this one. It's not a perfect copy of every documentary, clip, or movie...but then for the price who would expect it to be. It is entertaining and includes celebrities and stars including Walt Disney, Lucille Ball, James Stewart, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Walter Houston, Lloyd Bridges and many more.Overall 4 stars and enjoyable. Below we've added some information about each disc.Disc 1: The True Glory...with an introduction by Dwight D. Eisenhower. 1945/ 120 minutesDisc 2: Prelude To War...narrated by Walter Houston. 1943/ 133 minutesDisc 3: Great Battles...The Battle of Russia (1943/ 90 min.),Battle of Britain (1943/ 52 min.),Battle of Midway (1942/ 17 min.),Fighting Lady (1944/ 16 min.),Memphis Belle (1944/ 42 min.),and the feature film, THUNDERBOLT, starring James Stewart and Lloyd Bridges (1947/ 45 min).It is Region 0, ALL regions.Length: Approx. 8 hours 35 minutes"
1,Same as Adagio Music for Healing,"Almost downloaded this until I realized I already owned it under a different title - Music for Healing, Adagio"
4,We are an open possibility ...,"Three decades before the movie ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"", Joseph Chilton Pearce was exploring the boundaries of physics, searching for an answer to that same question.A synthesis of science and spirtuality, religion and quantum physics, the cosmic egg that we live in yields itself to us only when we search out the cracks in the shell of reality, those ""aha!"" moments when inspiration and insight open our minds, however briefly, to the possibilities that surround us. Pearce submits to us a pastiche of works by philosophers, religious thinkers, and scientists to create a guide to finding these cracks.At times the writing style is a little too verbose; there is a lot of information to synthesize, and Pearce is sometimes overwhelmed by the scope of the subject (the nature of reality and perception!) as any writer would be. The many referenced works are gathered in a helpful bibliography.A good overview of the human condition."
4,Nature Bats Last,"Practical Survival by Tony Nester follows through with his teachings: keep it lightweight, portable and filled with enough information to get you through to the next day. His experience from different regions of the country can appeal to everyone looking for a very quick reference for getting them out of a fix.My one tongue-in-cheek beef is that Nester believes it necessary to be prepared ahead of time, before you're stuck. Gee, and here I thought everything would come to me. With his tips on survival kits, you could be ready in five minutes with things found around the house. And he gives plenty of ideas with clear photos to show you the skills to practice. I applaud his insistence on practicing the skills ""before you actually need them"", and his reasoning behind selecting certain items or choosing behaviors to keep you going. My kit is now packed and I'm ready to head to the backyard for a few trial runs, before I get on the highway."
1,Doesn't Work,"The steamer never get hot enough to create steam. It would heat up slightly, the ""ready"" button would go off, but when you pressed the steam button nothing came out. It never worked, so I am sending it back."
1,Very disappointed,"I ordered five of these because I thought I was getting the classic round original stick. They sent the same lousy ""new"" formula and package design that you find at any store.I'd say this was false advertising and a total waste of my time."
1,Old Spice classic stick,The photograph represents what I thought I was ordering. I got the new slim style which is not what my husband likes. Did not return- donated it.
1,wrong stuff!,"The image shown, as I type this, is what I wanted, a tube of old spice. What I got was a flatten oval stick. In all fairness, they didn't want it back and refunded the money."
1,not what was pictured,not what I wanted. wrong picture and they knew it was wrong when sent as per all the other comments.
2,Photoshop book by Scott Kelby,"This is an older version, but I am not very impressed with Scott Kelby or his organization: NAPP. After trying to get support for issues on-line and otherwise, my impression is that the Kelby organization is very proud of itself. There are far better training materials on-line e.g. lynda.com"
1,"a good book, but it wasn't what i needed","i returned this item because it wasn't what i needed, still, a good book though"
3,Not for the faint of heart or easily irritated parent.,"There is always something in our childhood that our parents despised. There's always that one obsession. Mine was watching My little pony videos over and over until my parents ""lost"" the video.Bella Dancerella Pop Star is the same way.My daughter LOVES it, but she also wants to watch it 3 times a day. The music doesn't change throughout the entire video (for each different routine it's the same song) so that definitely gets old fast. The girls are a little over the top, acting-wise, but that's a given i suppose. The instruction is a little condescending and cheesy, but again, that's not suprising.Overall, your kids will adore it, but it will drive you insane. Here's hoping someone smart will come up with a ""movement"" dance video with GOOD music.but for now i'll be hearing ""everybody do the breakdown! the bella breakdown!"" in my head for eternity.Note: i'm thinking that they might have the soundtrack to this video in hell."
3,bella bella ... my daughter is frustrated!,My daughter received this for her 5th birthday. She has some ballet experience so we thought she would pick up on this rather quickly. Only one portion of the DVD is really instructional-And that part is FAST FAST FAST! Did I say Fast?! Thank goodness for the rewind feature on the DVD-- This music is redundant--but that's ok--my daughter loves it. She so wants to follow & do the dancing but there is little to no actual step-by-step instruction. It's basically several cute bubbly girls dancing away on a plastic numbered mat.On the upside--she still loves her microphone headset & singing along. This product could easily be improved by adding chapters with varying difficulty level so as to allow younger children to catch on. The label DOES say 5 years & up!
1,What a rip off,We purchased this for our daughter after she loved the original ballet version so much. I expected the same quality of the original product and was very disappointed. The mat is very cheap and flimsy and my daughter broke the headset trying to get it on her head.
1,Not What We expected,"We bought this for our 7-year old for Christmas. We are dissapointed in the quality. The mat is flimsy and so creased from being in the package that it will not lay flat. The headset feels ""cheap"" also. The video is VERY difficult, especially for a child. The ""dancers"" don't use much vocabulary to help the child get started. They just start dancing and expect the kid to keep up. It's VERY fast. I even had trouble following along. Our daughter was so frustrated, she cried. I do not recommend it for young children, especially those with little or no prior dance experience."
5,I love these - great idea!,"My kids all love to dance, they take dance class, but it's only a couple hours a week. This gives them a chance to have fun at home! They love it, and it gives them exersice while watching TV instead of just becoming couch potatoes like the majority of kids these days. (mine included) The media is so geared to TV for kids that it's hard to tell them ""No"" - but this at least gets them up and dancing, instead of playing video games and getting fat!These are good for all ages!"
4,Not as good as Ten Little Ladybugs,"I bought this book for my daughter because she loves the Ten Little Ladybugs so much, but althought the colors are much more vibrant and I personally like this book, my daughter doesn't care for it nearly as much as some of her other books. The storyline doesn't flow as well in rhyming."
3,"A cute story, but not as good as the first","When I saw this at the store, I was so excited. My 16 month daughter loves The Ten Little Ladybugs book. When I got the book home and studied it more, I realized it was written by a different author and the first book was much better."
1,Good night sweet butterflies,"I was very disappointed with the condition of this book. It was listed as very good, but it was very very used. I was unable to give it as a gift to my grandson, and had to put it in the thrift shop pile. Of course I could not consider returning it because the book price was less then postage"
2,Not up to standards,"The book was supposed to be like new, but each page had a hand written page number. It was very obvious that this was not part of the original book and nothing was mentioned about it in the product description."
3,Just okay...,"My 19 month old daughter's favorite book it the Ten Little Ladybugs, so when I saw that this book was created by the same people I grab it without taking time to really read it. Little did I know, the author and the illustrator are not the same. The book kept my daughter's attention but it does not have the same rhyming sceme as the first book. After paying closer atteniton I realized it says that the book is by the ""creators"" of Ten Little Ladybugs not the same author."
2,glitter,Its an ok book but what I hate about it is the butterflies have glitter on them. My one year old touches them and gets bits of glitter on her hands. I stashed it away and I don't know if I will take it out.
4,Texas Gardening Basics,"I would recommend this book as a starting point for Texas gardening. Since I'm new to TX, I needed to understand what basic gardening is like here in the Dallas area. I heard Neil Sperry speak recently, and he's a wealth of information. It may be time for an undated version of the book."
3,Neil Sperry's Complete Guide to Texas Gardening,I did recieve this book on the date as promised. I bought it for vegetable gardening. Out of 12 chapters only one chapter covers gardening and 1 chapter covers fruits and nuts. The rest of the book is devoted to trees and landscaping. I was dissappointed that it didn't have more information on gardening here in Texas. I hoped that it would be more comprehensive on this subject than it is. This book is good but not for the information I wanted.
3,Texas Gardening Book,The book is good for overall gardening but I was looking for more of a vegetable garden type book so didn't work well for me.
3,Texas Gardening,"It has not been as helpful as I had hoped. Most of my questions cannot be answered from this book, but it is still nice to have around."
4,"Comprehensive, beautifully illustrated, but not easy to use","This is my second favorite gardening book. It is very comprehensive with over 400 plant listings. It has descriptive listings of the different varieties of each species. The photographs are informative and beautifully shot.I am mot awarding 5 stars for the following reasons. Important information such as water needs is missing. The other information is poorly organized and forces you to read through a large description to find it. The chapter divisions are not usably organized. For example Dale Grooms Texas Gardening Guide has chapters on Annuals, another on Bulbs, Corms, Rhizomes, and Tubers, another on Native Wildflowers, another on Perennials, and a separate chapter on Roses. Dale Groom also has icons identifying Sun Preference and whether it is Drought Resistant. This is much easier to use.Well worth having in your library, but because it is not easy to use, it will probably not be the first book you reach for."
5,A Perfect Gift.,I have given this book to several people - and I laugh 'till i cry every time I read it.
5,Do Not Operate Machinery While reading This Book..,HILARIOUS. Be warned you may laugh yourself sick!
5,Laugh Out Loud and Choke Yourself Doing So,"Absolutely hysterical. How could so-called ""educated"" students make these ludicrous errors? Sadly, as a college student myself, I have seen such errors made by my peers. And worse. (teacher) ""What do we mean when we refer to the 'Western world?'"" (student) ""Texas?""Even those who do not have a very firm grip on history will find this book a riot. If you do have extensive knowledge on world history, try not to wet yourself, and enjoy."
1,"""Fool me once,shame on you.Fool me twice,shame on me.""","This is the same book as Non Campus Mentis;just with a different title. See my review for that book which I posted on March 1,2010 and my added warning."
3,A few hits but a bit cruel,"There are a few funny moments in this book, where people make mistakes that just come out hilariously funny. In the end though, it just ends up being cruel. I am a history teacher and I have had kids make some of these same mistakes. For some of them it is an issue of dyslexia and for others English is their second language. None of these students was attempting to publish this material and they didn't have the luxury of an editor. (I would love to see the mistakes of the author pre-editing!) I guess it is okay for airplane, train, or subway reading but realize that you are laughing at someone else's misfortune."
4,"Funny for us, but I feel sorry for the graders","Funny blurps, I just didn't give it a five because I wanted more!"
4,Very funny - and amazing since it's true...,"Some of these are incredulous, but they are all bona fide test answers.Sounds like Norm Crosby had a gaggle of kids and sent them all to his guy's class.Makes me appreciate my own students!"
5,Animal House Desecrated,"This is American humor returned to us through all the Sept 11 downturn. I am sure a movie will also be made of this American Graffiti. The real truth from a college educated point of view lets us know our children better start learning earlier, like in Kindergarden. Well, Bill recommends SB 1 or God By Kark Mark Maddox"
3,"Funny, but not THAT funny","Other reviews here overrate the reactions you'll have. It only takes a few pages to get the idea. Beyond that, it serves well as bathroom reading for a few days. But the fun doesn't last long.It probably still makes a fine gift for any academic. It would probably take a teacher/professor to find, and hold, the humor."
5,Packed with comedy both intentional and unintentional,"Compiled by Anders Henriksson, Professor Anders Henriksson's Non Campus Mentis joins a few other titles in gathering funny student papers and misconceptions, providing them together in a survey of history which is anything but ordinary. From Marie Curie's Noel Prize for inventing the radiator to nobles who claim to be descended from better jeans, this is packed with comedy both intentional and unintentional."
4,Fun,"I bought this one for my husband at Christmas. He is a history teacher and I figured he would enjoy it. Well not only did he, he has bought a few copies for other colleagues."
4,There but for the grace of God..........,"Having taken too many exams while ill-prepared, too tired from cramming, too nervous, or too hungover; I have some empathy for the students in this very quick, very funny collection.Those who think these entries are fake have never graded high school or college eassay exams. In a tense testing enviornment, words often flow without the assistance of thought or editing.But before anyone feels to superior, take the quiz at the end of the book. Few of us would ace it."
5,History as it never was,"Line for line, one of the funniest books I have ever read. Of course, they are like inside jokes, if you don't know the real story, you will miss most of the humor. If there is ever a volume 2, I am there."
5,It's one of those things you know....,"The more you know about world history and the larger your vocabulary, the funnier you're going to find this book. If you are just learning about events in history from reading this book, you'll find parts of it annoying, but if you know what the student is trying to write about, you'll get a real kick out of it.I got it for Christmas, had to wrestle it away from other people, and after it passed through three pairs of hands, finally managed to read it. I couldn't stop laughing."
1,NON...CAMPUS...INTERESTING...,"Please god...make one of your angels come and take this tragedy from my mystified hands...It devastates the tastes and murders the passions...Assaults the senses and molests the intellect...It unwittingly impregnates the teenager of one's mind and causes it to be kicked out by its parents...Were literature ever considered the source of god's love, this collection of writings is it's Chlamydia...There is no antibiotic to cleanse the infection that jumps bacterially from the pages into my brain. It is Lyme disease, and the author a tick. The black death upon mankind's advancing civilization. It is the janitor's closet next the overflowing public toilet in the basement of Dante's 7th level of hell where Satan keeps all of his overused plungers.If it were a living thing, I'd shoot it to put it out of its misery.I wouldn't read it in the bathroom if it were the last book on earth and I'd just drank some Mexican water.I just couldn't get into it. Not my kind of my book."
5,It's extremely hilarious but it's really sad...,"...that generations of people have such a twisted concept of history. Even my own father believed that Frank Lloyd Wright was one of the Wright Brothers (he's a roofing supervisor) and everyone knows that's not true. Either certain learning institutions aren't doing their job or college students aren't paying attention in class. Sometimes I think that the exerpts from the exams show that some students are deliberately writing these things in. Anyway, the book is hysterical. I read it in one day and tears were coming out of my eyes from laughing so hard. As a history major, I feel ashamed for my peers who know so little about our history."
3,Simple Book with Simple Fun,"I bought the book as a cute gift for a gift exchange at work, but couldn't helping working my way through before the wrapping paper went on. It's a very simple and cute book outlining many of the common mistakes a college student will make when attempting to sham his way through a paper he obviously hasn't prepared for.My laughter slowly subsided by the time I'd finished the first half of the book as the same type of simple word replacements (spell check fixing the spelling to the wrong word) and free association of history occurred.It's a cute book for a quick read and great book to loan out to others or sit on a coffee table for the random guest to peruse through."
4,Wonderful for the layperson,"If you are trying to find out where to begin your search for your inner child this is a good place to start. There are a number of excercises written in plain english that you can do alone, or share with your therapist."
3,Just so-so,"This got pretty great reviews but using it with clients is difficult. As a therapist, I feel this book misses the mark. The author writes about her experiences and those of some of her clients in a narrative form which is interesting, but the only real exercise she proposes is a writing exercise using both your dominant hand ( as you now) and your non-dominant hand (as your child). She provides little insite about what to do next..... The book is not a text, not a workbook and not something a lay person ought to tackle on their own."
5,"Even after 20 years, I remember much of what was written","This little handbook reminds me how I make decisions. I was especially affected by the way that Dr. Ornstein put the saying, ""It's not really 'I'll believe it when I see it.', but on the contrary, 'I'll see it when I believe it.'"""
4,For all you tourists out there,"I can't improve upon the well-written review above (the one which praises this CD), so I will be brief. Some of the melodies here can stay with me for days each time I listen to the CD. The tune ""Modern World"" pops into my head about twice a month, on it's own. It is beautiful tragedy, and while you don't get a top-40 voice, you get a voice with tone, tone which can express more than pitch alone. John Cale is a favorite musician for me; you can hardly go wrong with anything he's ever put out. If he's doing it with Lou Reed, Eno or Neuwirth, so much the better."
3,Not Film Noir,"You may be disappointed with this film if you are expecting classic American film noir. It's more of a 1940s version of Matlock or Murder, She Wrote. As others have pointed ot, the cover has nothing to do with this film. The cover scene leads one to believe it's film noir (the title certainly suggests the genre) and my guess is that it was done on purpose to mislead for sales purposes. Considering the cost, I felt that I had my money's worth. The picture is clear (though not a restored print) and the film itself is entertaining. William Bendix is never bad performance wise. To me, he's one of the most likeable character actors the American cinema ever produced. If you see this film, I'm sure you'll be entertained. If you don't see it, you'll not have missed anything in my view."
4,Inspirational writing from a very independent woman,"Houston's description of the Ardeche region in France in ""Waves Every Color of Harvest"" was enough to make me hail the next taxi to the airport - and I HATE to fly. This collection of essays, of which many have already appeared in various popular publications, covers the gamut from adventure travel to self-analysis to the love of a good dog. Read this if you're stuck at your boring 9-5 desk and dream of life on the open road. And then rejoice in the convenience of indoor plumbing."
3,"not like her fiction, but still worth reading","""Cowboys are my weakness"" is one of my favorites of all time...this book just doesn't show the same sparkle. I gave it 3 stars because Pam Houston not at her best is still better then many predictable novelists (the romance novels and thrillers that are a dime a dozen).Some of the descriptions seemed dry and uninspired, but overall makes you wish you could be there. Of course there is a self-centered theme throughout. At first it was a little annoying, but she certinally does have a reason to share her life. Her adventures makes you think of things differently and the fact in modern society we really don't have much to justify complaining about. We may learn a thing or 2 from those in less developed countries about happiness and history.Definitely an ecclectic mix of stories and people. Moments of brillance... Worth the read, but just don't expect it to be like her fiction."
1,What an embarrassing title!,"I'm so glad I didn't spend money on this book, and borrowed it instead. After her last one, I thought maybe she'd do better with non-fiction. How wrong I was. Most of it seems, shall we say, exaggerated? Why do I get the feeling that this woman is a pathological liar?"
1,self promoting drivel,who does this woman think she is? There are some authors I think could write introspective books and manage to make it interesting and worthwhile (Anne Tyler comes to mind) but this is just a brag fest.
3,Where I'm Calling From,"I always envied the great-skiing girls with long straight hair who could keep up with the 'best' men in Park City when I was living there circa 1990-91. I fancied them all, but only in one dimensional (frequently horizontal) ways. When given the opportunity to perform for them, I always preferred sitting in front of a fire with a good book. I'm pretty much a solipcist, so I appreciate the generous way Houston lays herself bare. She's right about one suspicion: being thin doesn't a perfect life make. You fatique quickly, have frequent headaches and when you get cold you stay cold. Many different women (maybe men, too) will enjoy this book and more than a few will sneer at it. I can't be objective; it's such a delight to read about Mongo (slideshow, anyone?). But, give it a try; it might speak to you."
1,How about a little less of Ms Houston?,"I should have sat in the book store and read a couple of these before I wasted my money. She finally writes a non-fiction book (although I think all her stuff is ""non-fiction"") and it comes off at best like bragging, at worst like outright lying. The feeling of neediness I get from this woman makes me cringe. We're supposed to believe she's tough, strong, independent, gutsy. I sense that she is the exact opposite. I just wish she'd really, finally come clean about that."
1,self absorbed and narcissistic,The good writing in this book -- there is some -- is lost in the author's self deception that she is some kind of major literary figure. In fact she is nothing more than one of the many young people who came out of the Iowa MFA program with an inflated sense of self importance and a few good stories. This book shows her stretching hard for something that just isn't there. A pity.
2,Something Missing,"I anxiously awaited the arrival of this book from the libray. I LOVED ""Cowboys...."" it had really touched me inside; I felt like the author really understood the types of experiences I have had in my life as an outdoors woman, and the men I have known. ""A little bit about me"" was a huge disapointment. It felt to me more like writing as therapy, or journal entries, than stories that I could connect to as I have in the past. She does mention doing some therapy, ( which is always a good thing) but I found something lacking in this book, perhaps a sense of something deeper than "" I did this, I have done that..."" Only in two places did I find the ""Pam houston "" I was looking for: There is a fabulaous paragrash in the introduction where she talks about NOT climbing the Grand Teton, and the dog stories. The dog stories are absolutely marvelous; it's worh checking this book out just for those bits."
2,Self-absorption is her weakness,"Like some of the other reviewers, I love Pam Houston and found the stories in ""Cowboys Are My Weakness"" to be among the best I've ever read. This book, however, needed a good edit. While I want to admire Houston's directness, I find her obsessions with such things as her weight and her boyfriends (or lack thereof) very off-putting. It was like reading an endless ""Cathy"" comic strip."
1,terribly overhyped,"if the focus were more on the experiences and less on Ms. Houston's ego, this might have been a readable book."
5,Great filter,"The filter is crystal clear and works perfectly. I would put this against any of my B&W; filters any day.It's funny, I ordered this as I needed a 72MM pol filter in a rush and I couldn't find a B&W; 72MM in stock at that time. I was going to ""settle"" for this until I could get a B&W; to replace the sigma filter. I have since purchased three other sigma filters and love them all.Great filter at a good price."
4,Works nicely,"Bought this to use with my recently acquired Sigma 17-70 (2.8-4) and Pentax K-5. The filter works as expected, not much to it -- it's just a polarizer anyway. Being circular, it does not interfere with auto focus, of course. It is quite low profile, thin, so if it does give any vignetting at the widest angle of my lens (17 mm), I haven't been able to notice yet. A bit expensive, but it's good quality glass, multicoated. After all, why spend a couple grand on camera and lenses and then spoil it all with cheapo filters later?"
1,feels cheap,"this one feels really cheap. It doesn't have the same built quality of the hoya's with the same price range. You can feel the cheap sound when rotating it. I had a cheap $10 circular polarizer that seems to have the same built quality of this one. Unfortunately it didn't came broken or anything, so I don't feel like returning it."
4,Good Filter,"The filter works well, it's very slim and is easy to adjust. It's a little hard focusing manually while using it; and in cold weather it can get stuck on the lens. If that happens putting a rubberband around it to provide a better grip will do the trick. I use it with my 18 mm lens and have never noticed any vignetting on the photos I take with it, although there is usually a little bit of a bluish cast to the photos. That however, is faint."
4,A Neal Stepehson primer,"Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon (2002) propelled him to fame with a fast-paced techno-thriller. Cobweb, written jointly with J. Frederick George is set before that book and also written before and now published. However, Cobweb is a fine work, a real page-turner which segues between scenes in a much smoother and more purposeful way than Cryptonomicon. The main characters are credible, the plot redolent of conspiracy, cover-ups and as usual with Stephenson, a healthy contempt for bureaucracy. Cobweb is a precursor to Interface, another fine work, both best described as being in the techno-thriller genre but they can stand alone without detriment, one to the other. I highly recommend Cobweb and suggest readers cut their teeth on this book before proceeding to Stephenson's later works."
2,Slow going,"While the plot sounds like it would make a good story, it needed a good storyteller and that is where this book failed. It was difficult to stay interested in and I had a hard time sticking with it to the end."
4,Stephenson weaves a good tale,"I'm hooked on Neal Stephenson's writing. I liked this novel, though it took a while for it to get really gripping, for the pieces of the story to come together. I found the main protagonist, Clyde, to be a likable character. If you like Stephenson's style you'll like this modern-day thriller."
3,Takes too long to start,"This is a ""ok"" book, but it takes too long to start the ""real business"". It seems that authors were playing characters around and them suddenly realized ""well, we need a history"", and then compete to find something of interest. As a light reading is ok, but is completely below the stuff Neal Stephenson writes. Actually, I usually don't like much collaborative writings and this is no exception to the rule.Also, there are some side histories that really add nothing to the book and add too much text to it.I don't recommend buying it, or also not buying it. I am sure that it could lead to a good film, although the Bush government setting is too old now. Probably it needed a better editor, not better writers."
2,So Neal Stephenson wrote this?,"Sorry, that's just not possible. I've read Neal Stephenson's books and he is a very, very good author. This book is bad. The story is extemely disjointed. It jumps all over the place from character to character with no sense that things are coming together. And things don't come together. It's a very disappointing book. Rather reread Snow Crash, The Diamond Age, Cryptonomicon, Zodiac or the Baroque Cycle. Even The Big U is better than Cobweb."
4,A fun read.,"This book, despite its newer publication date, is a re-issue but is entertaining to read. Neal Stephenson and his uncle, George Jewsbury, under the name J. Frederick George, created a tale of intrigue set during the first Gulf War which is relatively fast-paced. Stephenson's talent for characters and entertaining narrative are evident. Like some of Stephenson's other books, especially Snow Crash, this book is easy to read and enjoyable. This book was originally published under the pseudonym Stephen Bury."
3,A quick read,"I was concerned when I picked this up--having had bad experiences when a famous name is followed by ""with....sub author."" While it's true this doesn't contain the depth or breadth that I've come to expect from Stephenson, it was nice to have something lighter. Having lived through the Gulf War, it was interesting to read a piece focused on it and referring to characters who were extremely tangible to me. This would be a good introductory book for people starting on Stephenson."
1,filled with errors...,"you have to know a lot about neural networks and statistics to see the errors, but they're there. Not much practical advice that's worthwhile."
1,A Request to the Book-Reviewers,"I haven't read this book and I don't know much about NNS, but willing to start. I found the reviewers of this book did an excellent job. Of course, every book has some limitations. Those pointing out the limitations are requested to recommend alternative books, especially for the beginners. Please ignore the star rating by me because I have to fill this to post my view."
4,Short daily practice,"Good, short, daily practice. Using it for homeschool. Each lesson is usually half a page. Quick and gets the job done."
4,Big Hit,"Purchased this as a gift for my niece who expressed interest in learning cursive, she loves the book and I hope to find such other great gifts!"
4,Excellent!,"This book is small enough for toddlers to hold with ease, and is made with heavy cardboard, instead of the normal pages of other books - easier for kids to turn the pages. My daughters loved this when they were two years old, and occasionally they like to read it again just for memories. The illustrations are great, and entertaining for young readers. The book is an excellent book for new readers to start with, as it has few words, and easy for them to build their confidence."
2,Doesn't work as a read-aloud,"While the pictures are wonderful, the poetry doesn't flow. Some pages have only two words on it causing unnatural delays in the familiar nursery rhyme while turning pages. Sometimes, my quick fingers are able to turn pages fast enough to keep up but then we don't get enough time to look at each picture. My not-quite-two-year-old loves it, though."
4,Nice cards,These are nice cards and made a lovely gift to a friend just starting out with oracle cards. A good beginner's deck
5,Soul Lessons & Soul Purpose Oracle Cards,This is the first book I have read that has had Cards with it. It was great fun to use the cards with the book. I have given a lot of the book and cards as gifts.
3,"They are just ""OK""","After reading so many good reviews I did decide to get this deck myself. The Law of Attraction will always hand you a card that is most helpful for you at the current moment. I do have to say the reason I rated this so low was the explainations in the book. They are sometimes very harsh and not very friendly. Almost like ""get over yourself"" kind of attitude. I'm used to decks that are more friendly with their wording not blame and guilt. I don't use this deck as often because of that."
4,Another book where I'm waiting for the sequel.,I bought this book to read on an airplane... Enjoyed it so much I didn't even get upset with the delays I encountered in transit.A strong start in a new series.
4,A good Vampire read,"Picked up a cheep paper back , for a wett weekend read and was surprised :) now have to get the rest in the series !!!"
4,A solid series start,"Funny how you get to read certain books. I started reading t his series, because I saw character dolls a very talented dollmaker had made. I started reading more on the characters and the bookseries, and as I love vampire books, I had to order it.I read the book in a day, just mesmerised by the characters, the storyline and the magnificent worldbuilding. I am now waiting for the other books to arrive at my doorstep, and I have the feeling they will be even more entertaining that book 1.That, by the way, is the only reason this book gets 4 stars, I think there is something better at the horizon for me :)"
3,Vampires and elves!,"Dhampir is a fantasy/action novel that combines the vampire slayer and elf fantasy genres. The hero pretends to fight imaginary vampires as part of a con game. As the story progresses we find out vampires are real, and the vampire slayer ends up fighting them to preserve those she cares about. Her partner is part-elf whose dog turns out to be bred to fight vampires. And ultimately our hero is also magical. The overall theme is that things are not what they appear to be and that our fantasies have a basis in reality.The authors do a fine job of crafting an interesting story. They are slightly weak on character development--I actually like the dog the best of all the characters. Good action read!"
2,Lacks Bite,"I was expecting a lot more from this book. The premise is very good, but the characters are stiff, and not very engaging. It sort of seemed like the authors couldn't quite decide which way they were going so didn't make strong choices. (I think they missed a good opportunity with the heroine and the main vampire)Perhaps the second book will be stronger. (There's definitely potential there)If I have the time I'll read their second book."
3,Vampires are victims too!,"I agree with the reviewers who sympathised in part with the vampires, because the female vampire was indeed presented as a victim. The Hendrees take a lengthy detour to tell the story of Rashed's companion, Teesha. She was a beautiful and happy young wife until she caught the attention of Corische, a vampire lord who took her to his castle, killed her husband, and made her a vampire too. After many years of resentment she persuaded Corische's head servant Rashed, himself a vampire, to kill Corische. Rashed and Teesha then fled to Miiska with two other vampires who had been part of Corische's entourage, where they bought a warehouse and developed it into a thriving business. The purpose of this must be to evoke sympathy for Teesha, so we're not looking at a black-and-white situation. I very much agree with this approach as it makes for a far more interesting read. However, the Hendrees then throw it away."
2,Good Idea - bad book,the book adds new elements to the typical hero/vampire twist but do not live more after it. It is a continuos repetition of the plot of hero tries to kill vampire / vampire tries to kill hero. Do not bother
1,Disappointment,"The premise of this book sounded interesting enough -- a half-vamipre, half-human conwoman and her elven partner take on real vampires after spending years taking the money of superstitious peasants. The book itself was a huge disappointment. The characters spoke in ""clever"" cliches and were described with unoriginal, flat sentences; the narration was painfully clumsy; and the characters themselves were impersonal and impossible to empathize with. Not an original phrase or idea in the entire book.If you're interested in a genuinely absorbing ""vampire"" read, look to C.S. Friedman's Coldfire trilogy. If you're looking for a good doorstop, buy Dhampir."
3,Better than I expected,"I usually don't go for this sort of novel, I picked it up in a hurry when desperate for something to read. Based on the cover art and back cover blurb, I didn't expect it to be very good at all, only better than total boredom.That said, I was pleasantly surprised. The characters were reasonably interesting and the plot was absorbing enough to keep me entertained for a few hours. Someone who is into the vampire genre might enjoy it considerably more."
4,Great combination of traditional fantasy and vampires,"Dhampir is a very dark book. Even when Magiere and Leesil play at destroying vampires, the fear of the villagers is so real that the act of destroying the creature must be done in the expected manner. I was instantly caught up in the secrets kept by the characters and how their pasts influenced their current actions. One of the things that I loved about this story was that the reader not only gets to know Magiere and Leesil but the trio of vampires as well. The vampires have such strong personalities and histories, making them much more sympathetic than generic monsters would have been."
4,Review,"This was an interresting book. The characters are well developed. I hope that the authors of the book continue because I would like to know what happens to the Dhampir & her companions.Here is a short summary of the book. A woman travels the lonely roads in search for towns that are willing to pay her to remove creatures that roam the night. However what the towns do not realize is that the woman is a fraud. The woman grows tired of the lies & decides that it is time to make a honest living, so she buys a tavern. What she does not realize though is that she is a Dhampir (half human & half vampire) & when the real creatures of the night decide to end her life. She must accept who & what she is to survive or die.I recommend this book for people who love action, adventure & humor. There is a unique way the authors wrote this book (by the way, I mean unique in a good way) & I hope that they continue with what they started. (HOPEFULLY this will become a series!).Sincerely,JenJayLynn"
2,I almost missed out.,"I really didn't care for this book. I am though a vampire book junkie. I can't help it. The book has an interesting concept. I love Dhampir but none really can write them well. I liked Magiere and Leesil a great deal that is one part of the book that I did like. I liked their prior relationship and how they have worked together.What I didn't like was the story, if was weak at best. It felt jumbled together as if the authors had these wonderful character to introduce but didn't know how to do it. The Plot of the story was confusing and sometimes dragged out and not truly believable.I do however like the latest installment Sister of the Dead-which I highly recommended and it maybe the true starting point of the series."
3,Entertaining and somewhat original.,"This is an excellent first venture for the authors. The two main characters are interesting and full of dimensions. They kept surprising me, all the way through the book. The villians are smart, and ironically full of humanity. The setting is quite different from ""run of the mill"" vampire novels. The world is well laid-out and it seems obvious that an actual map of the fantasy-place exists. The strength of detail, alone, makes this book worth reading. Altogether, I'm hopeful that the author will supply avid readers more novels like this one."
1,very bad product should be removed from there product list,"This toaster over looks nice, BUT! it will not toast or bake anythingit never gets hot. All looks. The Company should stop making it or improveit."
1,M&S Systems Audio and Door Bell System,"The company does not stand by their system. They relagate any repairs on their systems to companies that service a variety of products and services (such as alarm companies) and these companies don't know what to do with the M&S systems. I have a system that I purchased two years ago, had it repaired numerous times but it still doesn't work. Upon contacting the M&S company, they give tech advice over the phone but you may be on your own to translate their advice into an actual repair."
1,annoying,"After enjoying the first two books in this seriesI found this one very annoying. Constant narrativereminders of character shaping events fromthe previous books totally overwhelmed any newinformation. I found myself skimming through thereiterations looking for something new.I *forced* myself to finish the book, and was annoyedto realize it was not the end of the series."
3,"Fleetlord Atvar needs help, so does Turtledove","OK. The Tosevites are hard to subdue. I get the point. I got the point 1500 pages ago. This series appealed to me mainly because of my interest in WWII, but I think I'll stick to mainstream novels like ""The Triumph and the Glory"" or histories like ""The Victors"" or films like ""Saving Private Ryan""."
3,Good but repetitive,"Lizards invade earth during WW II - installment 3. A good storyline and backdrop, but the author repeats himself an awful lot. For example, in the first book the Lizards are suprised at how technologically advanced the humans are. In the 3rd book, there are still pages and pages of various lizards lamenting the same thing in almost the same words. Character development stopped somewhere in the 2nd book also. 1,200 pages into this series, the baseball player characters still relate everything back to playing minor league ball, almost verbatim in some spots. Could have edited the first three books into one or two faster, better books."
3,Poor way to wrap up epic story,"I was quite disappointed with Turtledove's concluding volume of the WorldWar: series. Oh, he sorta wrapped up the story line, and he killed off a few more of the less sympathetic characters, but the book didn't read like the earlier three - it seemed he was in a rush to get out the ""last"" volume and move on. Is the story finally over? I doubt it. Ol' Harry didn't wrap it THAT well - there is room for a lot more of these stories."
2,Yamabushi's mini reviews XX,"And this is where I jumped ship. Seeing 4, count `em 4 volumes left in the series and comatose plot development I could take no more. A boring and nearly pointless entry in the series."
3,"Loved it, but too many mistakes!","Really, I love the World War Series. but finding like 20 mistakes in the last 200 pages is simply too much. ""liked"" instead of ""lied"", names with lower cases, some character listing the countries bombed with nukes and mentioning Britain when it hasn't happened... Come one, has the author read the book? And the publisher?!Anyway, a good book if you are keen to continue the series, I'm moving onto the 4th and really hope this gets solved soon. Also very repetitive in some instances. How many times Atvar needs to look at the damn knight and say it would have been easier if the Big Uglies were still like that!?I keep reading, I still like it, but the series lost points... no way you can compare this to Tolkien I'd say."
3,Interesting,"I don't usually watch this type of stuff. This was a very interesting short little bit about the movie. If you have seen it this is worth the few minutes it takes to watch it.3 Stars - worthwhile, nothing exceptional, but certainly interesting."
3,"Good bag, small ""block pouch""","Happy with the overall quality of the bag, but the main draw was that it had a pouch for a yoga block. I specifically purchased the Gaiam cork block, assuming that since the bag advertised a block pouch, their block would fit. Not even close. We've managed to use the strap that came with the block to rig it to the bag, but I was pretty disappointed. If the block had fit, I'd have been really happy with the bag, but that was the main selling point on this one for me."
3,Ehhhhh....,"I ordered this bag around January 2010 and I loved it at first. But then a few weeks goes by and the band that goes around the pocket for the waterbottle/wallet area has fallen off the seams. I'm pretty much just living with it at this point since I don't want to have to deal with the whole warranty sending back stuff process.Otherwise, the bag is big enough for some good size mats. My only other complaint is the same as another customer in that the straps are not adjustable when throwing over your shoulder. Otherwise, it does it's job and the canvas is sturdy. Just wished the seams didn't come off the pockets so quickly."
5,Fantastic Bag!,I have had a few different mat bags over the years but this is by far my favorite. I love the 3 outside pockets (2 small & 1 big) and that the zipper runs the entire length of the bag. I have a Jade mat which is fairly thick; it fits in the bag just fine. The strap is a good length - works over the shoulder but also slings nicely across my body.
4,Great item,This is a great bag for all my yoga stuff encluding my standard mat except I wish my block fit in the bag.I love the the color and design verry earth tone.
3,"Roomy bag, but a couple drawbacks","The Amazon product description, as well as on the Gaiam site (and I spoke with a Gaiam customer rep), says that the strap is adjustable. Apparently, they are all incorrect. Both the first bag and the replacement bag I received were without the adjustable strap. That's a dealbreaker for me. I've returned them. The bag would not be useable to me with the adjustability. Too bad; otherwise it's a good bag.Ample room for a deluxe mat and sundries. Solid, smooth metal zipper. Strong cotton canvas; however, the material does not seem to be treated or coated with any kind of protectant, for it (I had it in black) picks up and retains dust easily and cannot be simply brushed off."
3,great bag,"This is a great bag. It is really pretty. Unfortunately, I had to return it. If you have a Manduka black mat, the bag is not big enough for it to fit."
5,It's in the bag.,It's so pretty on the outside - warm colour and design and feel of bag It comfortably carries my Gaiam yoga mat and the small pockets are very handy for those little extras.I recommend this bag to others.
4,The title speaks for itself!,"This was a great technical reference to experience. I was impressed with the explanation of the code as well as explanation of how to augment the code. The author has spend quite a bit of time looking into the repercussions of some ""hacks"" to certain scripts that could make a system vulnerable to attack. This is definitely one of the best compilations of shell scripts that I have seen. I will personally be using some of the scripts in the book to make my life easier, such as script #42 (Improving readability of DF) and #52 (Killing processes by name). This book is a fun read as well as an important piece of arsenal for the bookshelf."
3,geeks only,"Taylor does some neat stuff with shell scripts, but he doesn't spend much time explaining what goes on in them. Each is accompanied by a terse paragraph explaining ""how it works"", which generally only addresses one particular aspect of the script (ie, POSIX-style ""variable slicing""). Shell syntax is terse and many of the reserved keywords and functions are not self-evident. If you don't know, for example, what ""${#remainder}"" returns, Taylor won't help you; you will have to look it up in a tutorial or a reference work elsewhere.According to the blurb on the back of the book, Taylor has an MA in education, but there is little evidence of his didactic skills in this text. On the face of it, he is more a geek than a teacher, and hence this book more useful to his fellow hackers than people new to Bash."
2,Just plain wrong,"This is a collection of very basic shell scripts I found completely useless. The author presents the book in an advanced format, not giving much underlying information or hand-holding; however the information contained is very beginner level.The author David Taylor also has many bad habits in his scripting and tends to take a wordy approach. Many of the scripts Taylor advertises in his book can be compiled into a command or two on a single small line of code. For example why would you pipe a grep command to awk when awk has a more powerful search function than grep already built in?I did not find any advanced commands in his entire book. There were a couple very basic 'sed' and 'awk' commands but nothing which made me think anything about them was 'wicked cool'"
2,Not worth the price,"Googling for scripts is free and you can find numerous scripts in the realm you're interested in. The scripts are interesting, but it's impractical to ever use them in your profession. Of the scripts listed in the book, I only found one that I plan on using (the grep that outputs lines above and below the found text). The majority of others I didn't even read because they're frivolous.I don't see what the 20+ others see in this book to give it such a high rating."
5,"Nice book, really cool!","It is nice , excellent book for experienced user. I found it to be the nice, logical continuation to ""UNIX essentials"" DVD course that I found here on Amazon. They supplement one another very nicely and helpfully.It is easy to read and follow, the examples are clear and well described. Overall very nice effort!"
5,Wickedly excellent!,"I first laid eyes upon this book at a computer show; the publisher had a paper copy. This is a cool publisher with alot of cool books and as I browsed this one I realized that this was going to be another one. Yipppeee! It's finally out and it's even better with the real cover :)Okay, seriously now. This is a great book. Gets right to the point and it's much more fun to ready than other scripting books that I've seen. You get alot in a little space."
3,101 handy little scripts for unix geeks,"This is a fun little book of 101 shell scripts for *nix systems. The scripts are indeed cool, and some are very useful. Unfortunately the code isn't hilighted, so it can be difficult to read when it's spread across multiple pages. The commenting and explanations are somewhat uneven.That being said. It is a fun book and it can be useful. Just make sure you check the table of contents so that you know you are getting a few scripts you can use."
2,deceiving,"I purchased this as a gift for someone who is a Basil Rathbone f, but the cover on the DVD is not accurate . There are only a few of hs movies the other Sherlock Holmes movies on the DVD are by other actors, I and the person receiving the gift were dissapointd."
1,bad assumptions throughout,"The book misrepresents the process of bereavement. There is no recovery, because grief is not an illness."
2,pietre performance,"dommage, dommage, un manque flagrant de travail preparatoire a cet enregistrement, une prise de son souvent discutable, ( le coup de canon de la Valse m'a fait croire sur l'instant au passage du mur du son d'un avion a basse altitude !) des prises de vue banales sans interet, mais surtout une interpretation de Martha dans le Mozart frisant la desinvolture avec un ensemble parfois discutable sur des pianos dont on se demande s'ils sont bien accordés. La vedette de cette pietre performance reviendrait plutöt a Nelson Freire au jeu strict bien ciselé, un peu conventionnel. Un manque de respect pour l'auditeur - spectateur que je suis. A la posterité, jugera t on Martha Argerich sur un tel enregistrement ?"
4,A goofy clock that's a turn on.,"I bought this clock for my daughter-in-law, who is an architecture student. I'm not sure why, but she loves it.It's important to be aware of what it is NOT, i.e. it is NOT an alarm clock. Because of the brightness of the LED display, it would also be annoying, after lights out, if it were placed in a bed room.It also seems rather pricey for something so simple."
5,Shimmering Review...,"I first heard the music from this CD as the soundtrack to a movie being made, and I fell in love with the gorgeous melodies and incredible lyrics right away. Natasha's Ghost has done an outstanding job creating something that will truly invade your soul - from the deep, dark intensity of ""What I Want"", to the upbeat yet philosophical ""Natalie"". One of the best original CDs I have come across in a long time!"
5,this girl kicks ass!!,"heard the album shimmer on the soundtrack to ""A family affair* lesbian film, waited to the end of the film to find out who this girl was singing right through the film and got to the credits and there was the name...so i raced to the computer and buy the cd, since it ain't available in Australia ( where i am from ) so it is on it's way to me now...cannot wait to hear it on my cd player up loud, instead of on the tv all the time...the music and words are beautiful....love her music!"
2,difficult to fit on tripod legs,I mistakenly thought that buying the leg protectors specifically made for the tripod would assure a good fit.How wrong could I be! They were too tight to zip up and I finally hade to resort to stretching them with a differeent piece of metal tube and then installing them The problem was compounded by extremely sticky adhesive strip on the leg covers. If I didn't know better I would think that these covers were old stock that the adhesive strips had deteriorated into a sticky mess and that the vinyl used in the construction of the covers had lost its elasticity. To cap it all one of the zipper pulls broke as I was trying to install the cover on the tripod. I had to use pliers to get it to finally close. They are on the tripod now and never to come off!
5,Tells it like it is,The author has a great style and really nails this subject. We are going to use this material in a teen and a Mom's class. If you think this book is to forward you have no idea of today's culture among our children.
1,terrible.,"""Marketing""?!Do we really want to teach our girls that they are commodities to be ""marketed"" to men? This is not the way to teach them to respect and love themselves."
1,If you want to learn how to be narrow minded and judgemental...,"then by all means, read this book. I agree with the authors general ideas on modesty, but she seems to think that her opinions are facts. She also seems to think that she knows what everyone else is thinking and what everyone's motives are. This book was a great idea for a learning tool, but it just doesn't realistically work."
1,wow,"this is the most sexist, feminist, male hating, goddy book i have ever read. a complete waste of my time. save yourself from this abomination."
2,I long for the old days...,"Cutting audio is currently doing all of the past books of Deathlands. Listening to those really make me realize exactly how far down this series has come in the past few books. This one is a retread of old ground. It is a simple read, not much characterization and I long for a decent plot. Stick with the old ones, or if you never read these start with Vengeance Trail."
2,Strontium Swamp,"Did this book even have an editor? I found it very difficult to read due to the distraction caused by horrible spelling and poor sentence structure. For example, people repeatedly strap a gun belt around their ""waste"" in this book. Was Microsoft Word's spellchecker the only editor?In one segment, each of the companions is knocked out with tranquilizer darts and somehow Mildred gets knocked out twice, in different manners three pages apart. Couldn't the author keep track of his characters?This is stuff that ANY editor should have caught. Or even a simple proof reader for the most part."
2,Just couldn't get into it,"I like to read. I read a lot. Diverse styles, genres, etc. This book I just couldn't read. I couldn't complete it. I think the thing for me was that the characters seemed so juvenile, that I just couldn't relate."
5,Satin Doll,This was an excellent story. Regina(the main character)was really something else. You won't want to put this book down. I can't believe the way her past clashed into her future. I'm glad the way everything turned out though. This should definitely be in your must read pile...
1,don't waste your time or money,"I couldn't even get past page 100. This book did absolutely nothing to keep my interest, not that it ever had my interest. I gave this book a fair chance, even though I had to force myself to do so. The relationship between Charles and Regina was beyond unrealistic. I mean, she was dissin' him one minute and hooking up with him the next. I do not reccommend this book and only wish I had kept the receipt."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"This book started out slow but got pretty good, but the ending just killed the book. The ending was so unreal I was totally disappointed. This was not worth the money. I don't know what everyone else was reading."
3,GOOD STORY,I ENJOYED THIS BOOK I LOVED THE STORY AND I LIKED THE TWISTS AND TURNS. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK; IT WILL KEEP YOUR INTEREST. THE MAIN POINT OF THE STORY IS TO SHOW A HOODRAT TURN INTO A PROFESSIONAL.
4,Spoiler Alert about Previous Reviews,"Some earlier reviews of this book contain annoying spoilers - USC80's review in particular. Beware! That being said, this is a good book, and I highly recommended it to black female readers who are sick of the ""yo girlfriend"" Terry McMillan-rip off school of writing."
5,Satan Doll,"What can I say. I just finished reading the book and it was all that and more!!! It was a recommended read through the African Americans Literature Book Club, where I usually go to find a good book to read and I'm glad I did. Trust me, it was very hard to put down. Karen kept the characters so real and down to earth. These characters were like people we have contact with in everyday life. It was sad, funny, and mysterious. All the right ingredients needed to create this best seller. Regina learned a very valuable lesson here. All that glitters is not gold & you have to learn how to take care of ""self"" first, which is what she did. She went on about her business and did it in grand style."
2,Not what I exspected...,"I just finished this book and I must say that I was throughly disappointed. I kept expecting more ""umph"", more attachment to the characters, more development and it never came. Regina finally figures out what's wrong with her but does nothing about it. Her revenge is totally strange and makes no sense. Puddin is a strong character who obviously has great character potential but it never surfaces. The storyline between Yvonne and the married man was ""DEAD"". And Charles was boring and a waste of time for both me and Regina. And what about...Oh forget it. I sure did'nt read the same book that the other reviewers read.I just kept expecting more...."
2,DIDNT LIKE THIS BOOK,"FIRST I LIKE TO SAY THAT I REALLY WISH I DIDNT PURCHASE THIS BOOK IT WASNT WORTH THE MONEY.WHEN I READ THE BACK OF THE BOOK IT SEEMS SO INTERESTING,BUT IT WASNT THE STORY WAS SO BORING. TO ME IF SHE WOULD OF TOLD MORE ABOUT HER PASS IT WOULD OF BEEN MORE INTERESTING TO READ,AND HER FRIENDS ALSO WHERE VERY BORING THIS BOOK LEFT SO MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT THE CHARACTERS OUT,BUT I HOPE SHE WONT DO A PART TWO PLEASE DONT KAREN.I WAS GOING TO READ IM TELLING BUT I CANT FIND MYSELF TO READ ANOTHER BORING BOOK BY THIS AUTHOR.I WOULDNT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE."
4,Satin Doll,I've had the honor of meeting the wonderful Ms. Karen. I am a member of the ESCAPE BOOK CLUB and Karen sat in on our last meeting in which we reviewed her book at the famous Perks Restaurant. We all loved her story and we even got to tell her how we wanted it to end. A great read for everybody! Yvonda
4,EXCELLENT NOVEL.,Regina had a rough life as a child but was determined to make things better for herself as an adult. I felt that Charles really loved Regina with all his heart but his mother was too much to deal with. I was very glad when Yvonne and Regina made up. Puddin was crazy.This novel is a sure winner. I can't wait to read more from this author. Be Blessed.
3,So So,"The book was so so...the beginning was interesting and so was the ending, had to force myself to read through the middle though. I believe that the use of a lot of the ""big"" words and proving a point to Charles was the author's lame attempt to prove to the readers that she knew a little something. I did like the realistic ending. This book is a book to buy on sale, or pick up from the local library...definitely a ONE time read."
4,Decent Story,"One of the best part of the book was when my girl stole ole boys stuff but not really, yo that was the bomb.then I like the part how girlfriend caught the hubby in a lie.but most of all I like how you let ole girl go from drug dealers girl, shoplifing, getting shot, taking care of the neice, marrying the senator, then moving own cause check this, I got my own sh-- I don't need you?! Word!It was an al'ight book (Ha Ha Ha)"
5,SATIN DOLL is the best book I've ever read!,"I LOVE SATIN DOLL, this book is so exciting to read. I couldn't put this book down because I couldn't wait to see what was going to happened next. As me being a person who really doesn't like reading books because I lose interest... this book I read from beginning to the end with no lost of interest.I love Regina's character, she doesn't take anyone's mess ""the Harlem way."" This book acknowledges my homwtown, Harlem, and I think there's a good message in this novel- ""It doesn't matter where you're from or what you've been through you can do anything as long as you put your mind to it, and don't let anyone take that away from you."" I'm looking forward to reading more books from Karen E. Quinones Miller. Beside her being my cousin I think she is a terrific and creative writer. I would recommend this book to anyone."
5,A VERY GOOD BOOK! A MUST READ FOR EVERYONE!,"Satin Doll, was in one word, excellent. I loved this book from start to finish. It goes to show that you can be anything you want to be. As the President of the BBC (Black Online Book Club) this is sure to be a future selection. Good Job Karen! LuvfrmU2ME@aol.com"
1,Hated It!,"Reading the back of the book cover I thought this book was going to be very interesting. But it was very boring! Karen Quinones Miller definitely needs to improve her writing style. Her writing does not flow and her characters have no substance. Maybe I'm being a little critical, but she seemed to love the word ""incredulously"" she kept using it over and over! Waste of my time!"
2,Did we all read the same book?,"I kept telling myself that this book would get better if I just gave it a chance but it never did. I bought this book because of all the 5-star reviews and because it was number two on the rack in the bookstore where I purchased it. I only wish I could get my money back. I give the author two stars for effort but the book was just down right silly, unrealistic and had extremely poor editing. While I commend her for completing a novel, I think I'll pass on whatever she writes next."
2,Expensive and low quality,It's made of cheap felt and cost too much. The premium you pay to get a famous character Halloween costume is not worth it.
5,Fantastic T.V.,Right out of the box this was a fantastic HDTV and I haven't had a single complaint about it yet. Found a great deal on Amazon with free shipping. Only has one HDMI input which is somewhat limiting other than that absolutely superb picture quality.
1,Very Happy Now 4-Stars!,"I returned a KDL-40S20L1 to Sam's Club because you could not use the zoom function when watching a 720p/1080i source. Many HD programs are not in full 16:9 screen so this became very annoying.I saw this KDL-40S2400 at Amazon for a great price and ordered it. The service from Amazon and the delivery from Eagle were excellent.I would give it 4 stars. The HD is fantastic, but the SD is lacking. It usually is on HDTV's due to upscaling 480i signals. Buy-Buy-Buy!"
5,"Absolutely adorable, a marvelous book.","I was delighted and amazed with this charming book on insects. I picked it up as a coffee table book, but it soon became one of my favorites. Koch's illustrations are unique and eye catching, and her text is informative and fun. This book is a well loved member of my library, not to mention my coffee table..."
3,Devonsheer Sesame Rounds,"Years ago, the Devonsheer Rounds were the best Sesame Crackers out there. They are really hard to find these days. Ordered them on Amazon and find they are no longer as great as they used to be and the Old London Sesame Rounds are by far the better cracker."
4,Explains the Issues,"In a scholarly world infected with so much liberalism, Blomberg is a bonafide evangelical trying to help Christians understand the parables. I had to read part one and chapter nine of this for a class on the parables. I appreciated his way of bringing forth the issues surrounding proper handling of the parables. However, I'm not sure that this is the best reference for understanding the issues surrounding form and redaction criticism."
1,Got this book quick and wanted to sent it back quick.....,"I have been a nurse for 18 years, I have many certification review books CPAN,CCRN and CEN. This book is the worst book I have ever ordered in my whole nursing career. [This price] for a paper back book with large fonts and a bunch of bibliography fillers to stretch it out. I wanted to send this book back after opening. What a disapointment. What is so sad is that I can't get my money back for this weak excuse for a book. I have always been a supporter of my profession. To sell this book for [the price] is a rip off to any Nurse. Honest value [is much less]I have the aspen disc which is excellent. Please save your money and buy something else that is worthy."
4,America Leads All and Other Poems,"This book is a wonderful collection of poems, easy to read and casual. My family and I had a good time reading, in particular, ""Grandpa Does Nothing in the House"". ""America Leads"" summarized lot of events in a nutshell! Parry's reminder on ""Nine Eleven"" was emotional.My ten year old daughter, although does not appreciate poetry very much sat and read this book all at once! I strongly recommend this book of poems for all, the young and the elderly!"
2,Another Mess From Classic Media.!,"....Not even in cronological order.!..ugg.. Well I did my research, got all the titles & release dates together and re-authored the disc..Now I can watch it in sequence, something the ""Experts"" did'nt mention.Cronological order for the blue circle set is (1,2,3,4,6,5,7,8,10,11,12,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,22,21,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,9, 30,31,13,32 &33).Im 64 with a large animation collection and won't see my want list released,like UPA & Columbia Toons, but if your young and love the history of the genre don't support lazy quick buck artists like CM on the Harvey Toon Sets.!..There is only one way to do it, THE RIGHT WAY.!"
4,Not The Original Opening!,"Well, the cartoons look fine, but couldn't they have done some finaggling (?) to include the original openings? Hearing the ""When Katnip The Cat, Meets Herman The Mouse, Katnip The Cat, Packs His Bags & Leaves The House"" really MADE the cartoon!...but it's not here. Also believe it's basically the same as the DVD ""Herman & Catnip & Friends"". Neither had the song. Still enjoyable, though...just not as much as it could have been. Neat Cover Art."
4,better than Losi,"When I received the buggy I thought it's a cheap toy. After heavy abuse it's still performing as new ... doesn't want to die! Meanwhile I keep repair my fragile Team Losi trucks.The Flashfire better on batteries, both remote and car take very little while standby, proportional control works well, range is over 300ft."
4,Part of the foundation,"This is a book for serious internal neijia practitioners only and presents what I would call internal martial art code or the koans of internal neijia power. Like Tai Chi Classics by Waysun Liao, or the translation of Yang Ban-hou in Secrets of the Yang Style by Yang Jwing-Ming, this is written in code and is not a ""how to"" book. These books are good for reference and for confirming what you are learning, and for crystallizing your knowledge, but not for teaching or basic learning. Its the book that you go to when you have one of those ""aha"" moments and you see that the information was there in front of you all of the time. If you re-read the classics like this every few years, each time another piece falls into place and over the years your depth of knowledge grows as you walk the path."
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased these for my Manfrotto 055cxpro3 and they look good and provide protection both for the tripod and my hands, I have never seen a more poorly packaged product in my life. These are esentially flat foam pads that wrap around the tripod legs and zip together, good idea. What keeps them from slipping is the BAD idea, the inside is covered with glue. What makes this a REALLY BAD idea is the fact that they are shipped flat with the glue covered inside surface laying on top of the pad that is stacked below it. As a result you need to spend alot of time cleaning the outside of the pads it get the glue off to make them usuable. I should have just returned them. After doing some research I don't think this an uncommom problem, it seems that no matter where this product is purchased it suffers from the same packaging problem"
4,Not really Fiction and a good book,"This is a well written book, but you should know that it is based on a true life. My friend suggested I read this and said it was based on the life of his father, a college professor at one of the traditional black colleges, who used to entertain his friends with stories from his childhood. A friend of the professor (the author) asked if she could compile the stories into a novel and the professor said yes. When my friend read the book, he recognized every character because he knew them (one was, of course, his father). And he recognized the stories as he had heard them too. But outside of the personal connection for me, this is actually an interesting book on a number of fronts as it paints a picture of a Southern black community that did exist in a peculiar set of circumstances with some great stories being told that are probably outside the norm of the stereotypical Southern black experience. I highly recommend it."
3,T-72 Main Battle Tank,"Positives:Book is strong on details and Gulf War-I experience. Excellent photos and colour plates and a cut out too. Data is reliable, accurate and comprehensive. Easy to read. Wish it had more of...:I wish it had more information on (i) performance in the field,(ii) reliability (iii)experience in the hands of other major armies such as the Indian Army, Russian Army etc instead of being limited to the debacle of the Gulf War where the capabilities of the T-72 were overshadowed by the overwhelming combined arms force of the Allies and the weak training and morale of the Iraqis. Given the paucity of data on Russian equipment this is overall the best book I have read on the T-72"
4,Impressed,"I wasn't looking to get a piece of this quality, simply to protect my lens, but this one is excellent. Go for it."
4,"Great Product, Poor Packaging, Excellent Return Service","The lens filter arrived promptly with 2 day shipping, and upon opening it I found that they had only included one tiny air cushion and the case had opened during shipping, leaving the lens filter to roam the package unprotected. After using a microfiber cloth and lens cleaner it appeared to be in good shape, but it turns out that it was not the correct size for my camera. However, the lens filter quality itself was very good, and despite the rough shipping it held up well, suggesting that it's reasonably durable. The return process was unbelievably easy and fairly inexpensive, totally painless."
3,Yo Yo,"A decent comp summing up the Yo Yo A Go Go show from 1997. The music sprawls from folky (Jenn Kliese and Khaela Maricich) to heavy rock (Loud Machine 5.0). It is very inconsistant if you listen through the album in its entirity because of such the large variety of bands that performed. There are many standouts such as Seagull Screaming Kiss Her Kiss Her, Lois, and Modest Mouse. I would recommend this cd to anyone who is trying to complete their collections of included artists but that is as far as I would go."
3,Don't believe pompous reviews,"The previous reviewer is mean spirited. Even if the book is not written in the most exhilirating style, it is one among many points of view. The reviewer's politics are obvious and interfering with his ability to appreciate. The bilge is all his."
1,Total Rip-Off,"Be VERY aware -This DVD is a one-hour documentary that contains absolutely no singing - no songs - and no performances by the Black Eyed Peas (BEPs).It simply discusses where the various members grew up, different musical influences they were exposed to, and a bit of history of Hip-Hop music prior to the BEPs making it big. During the narration a number of still shots of the band members are shown on the screen, but that's about it.Once again - NO SONGS - NO MUSIC - NO PERFORMANCES by the BEPs - a huge waste of $$ in my mind."
3,Save money - Buy a machete,"The Woodman's Pal is nice, and well built. Very solid! - But my $10 machete from WalMart tears through brush much faster, weighs less, requires less work, and I won't feel horrible if I leave it outside by mistake. I guess the Woodman's Pal looks wicked, though!"
3,"Flawed, but still enjoyable","This DVD is essentially a straight transfer of the VHS that's been around for ages. So on that score it's a bit of a disappointment that no extra effort was made to flesh out the offering with interviews, photos, bios, etc. But considering that most prog-related DVDs are done on small budgets it's no real surprise. The essentials of the video are solid, from camera work, sound, lighting, and recording quality, though don't expect a 5.1 mix or any other modern enhancements. And your mileage may vary when it comes to the theatrical elements that were slipped in, but I think they do a good job bringing the conceptual nature of the Camel album Stationary Traveler that this concert was supporting to the fore. The playing is excellent and it's nice to have a bit of Peter Bardens at the end, so all in all it's a nice slice from a period of Camel's history that often gets overlooked."
3,A good basic slate,"I had already read previous reviews, so I had a good idea of what I was getting. This is a good personal-use slate, but I wasn't terribly impressed with the quality of the stylus. But this is probably the least expensive metal slate & stylus that you'll find, so I was satisfied with the product."
1,Short Measure,This DVD lasts for 80 minutes - 'Carmen' usually lasts for much much longer = 172 minutes Levine. There are far to many cuts and hacks in this performance. You wince along open mouthed at what happens. Is this opera for people who do not like opera? The performance itself is OK so perhaps it should be treated as highlights but no more.
3,Great Missionary; Boring Text,"The life of Henry Martyn has inspired Christian missions for centuries, and deservedly so. The actual text though, is a bit on the dry side. Much of the book goes into detailed accounts of his sea voyage from England to India, an overland trip from India to Peria and his last homeward trek from Persia to Istambul. But aside from these lenghtly travelogues, the book does give an honest glimpse into Martyn's soul, his passion for the conversion of the heathen, and his spiritual struggles.Most interesting are the letters he exchanged with his love, Lydia, who eventually rejects his marriage proposal (very sad), and his encounter with Perisan Islamic Sufism. On the whole, the text is pretty laborous to read through. My own recommendation is to read David Brainerd's journal (a much more interesting read of a missionary to the North American native Indians), who partly inspires Martyn to be a missionary himself."
2,Brilliant in its day but ...,This book is amazingly clear and well written but several positions are wrong. As are 2 whole chapters. In it's day this was the best book period. Now I would start with 'Backgammon Bootcamp' by Walter Trice for an excellent accurate book. I would think about this after 'Classic Backgammon Revisited'. I rated this too low as it should b a 3 star but there doesn'tseem to be a way to change the rating just the review
2,Brilliant in its day but that day has passed,This book is amazingly clear and well written but several positions are wrong. As are 2 whole chapters. Get 'Backgammon Bootcamp' by Walter Trice for an excellent accurate book.
4,arrives unboxed...BUT Great product and perfect fit!,"I am highly disapointed in the fact no where does it state this item ships without box . This was to be a Christmas gift for my son, who happened to be here when it arrived and obviously with no box , everyone saw what it was! It really should state when ordering so that I could have sent him off someplace or made arrangements to ship elsewhere.. UPDATE... THIS PRODUCT IS VERY NICE AND FIT HIS TRUCK PERFECTLY , SO AS FAR AS THE PRODUCT GOES A+"
4,Betty Neels never disappoint,"Opening a Betty Neels book, you know what you will get. A down-on-her-luck, courageous, hard-working heroine. A mature (but not old), medical specialist, whose practise spans the Netherlands (where he was born) and England (where she lives). A slow courtship, where she is driven in style in a Bentley and fed delicious meals and a great numbers of cups of tea.It could be boring, these 200 book variations on the same theme. To the credit of Betty Neels, it never is.This is comfort reading just like your mother's cup of hot chocolate. It's not cuisine, but it warms the heart and hits the spot."
5,A Great Book from one of my favorite romance book Writers!,"Betty Neels charming books were some of the first romance books that I ever read and I really liked her book A Christmas Wish and I liked the characters a young English lady namd Olivia Harding and a Dutch man named Haso van der Eilser, the setting of the book took place in both England and The Netherlands. I recommend this book to every fan of Betty Neels wonderful books!"
3,Good to hang lightweight items,"I like that you can plant this as deep as you want, however although it suits my purpose, there could be a little more of a hook because when it is windy things tend to fly off. I haven't tried the pole mount. Nice enough item for the price but to hang a normal size bird feeder I'd recommend something a little sturdier."
3,Slender and slippery hook,"I had to insert this pole into a wider pole and tape the sections together for stability. Then I had to tape the bird feeder onto the hook so a wind wouldn't dislodge the link it hangs from. I only paid $15.00 plus S&H, but this is worth less with its thin pole and the weak hook."
5,"You'll laugh, because it hurts too much to hate","Like you, I've often felt like Torny was a good friend, who I never had the chance to meet. The kind of friend who knows-it-all, borrows money from you and never repays it and then hits on your sister. All the while, he thinks he's so much better than you just because he's a loudmouth.Tony is about truth and finding the everyday humor in life.Unfortunatley, I heard a rumor that Torny likes to ask attractive women if they'd like to go for a ""mustache ride"" when he first meets them. Now it's just a rumor so I would not believe it.Overall, Tony is the best, just ask him."
4,Snicker.,"This collection of humorous columns is not quite as good as Kornheiser's first, ""Pumping Irony."" I do, however, believe that when this collection was published, Kornheiser was still funnier than Dave Barry. (He has since gone downhill as he became more famous and focused more on his sports radio show.)This collection is quite amusing and if you are a fan of Kornheiser, Barry, or similar columnists, you should enjoy it. The columns are observant and self-deprecating with cute anecdotes and standard jokes. My personal favorite is entitled ""A Clothes Call"" and it details the author's shopping trip with another Washington Post sports columnist, Michael Wilbon. Other columns focus on Thanksgiving, dogs, parents, and weathermen. It is very much worth a try."
4,Good read,"Very detailed account of the race to the South Pole between Robert Falcon Scott and Roald Admunsen. This book will appeal to readers who have a more pragmatic and result oriented outlook on life and not so much to the more romantic and idealistic. Huntford conveys in a brilliant and well researched narrative the fundamental differences between both expeditions: Scott's, driven by the past, the glory of the British Empire, and the British people; and Admunsen's going forward toward the future and a more modern ""professional"" attitude in exploration and sports in general.This change in the approach to Polar expedition is paralleled in the mountaineering world."
5,Fascinating Comparison of the South Pole Explorers,"I found ""The Last Place on Earth"" a compelling comparison of the two different techniques of Amundsen (Norwegian) v. Scott (British). Although the book has a decidedly pro-Norwegian slant, it is extremely well researched. Much of the history of the Scott expedition has tried to show how Scott and his expedition were the unfortunate victims of bad luck and bad weather. Huntford is able to present data and quotes directly from the Scott party's journals to illustrate why the failure of the team rests almost exclusively on Scott's lack of planning and experience. The contrast with Amundsen's years of training and planning makes for an interesting look at leadership in general and specifically under such extreme environments as an Antarctic expedition."
5,Great Book that Informs and Engages on the Last Exploration on Earth,"The Last Place on Earth is a fantastic double biography on Amundsen and Scott and their journeys to the South Pole. This book is well written, while providing a compelling, well paced journey through the two protagonists lives. Though it is clear the author favors Amundsen, the book does delve into the qualities and faults of both men.For an introduction into the history of polar exploration, I cannot imagine a better book. From The Last Place on Earth, readers are offered a number of references books for further discovery."
5,worthwhile reading that takes you along on an adventure,"Huntford has acheived his purpose of writing an engaging tale of adventure, while placing the reader in the prevailing historical mindset of the day."
5,"More than just an Antarctic adventure book,","The Last Place on Earth boes beyond its primary task of being a compelling chronicle of the Antarctic expeditions of Scott and Amundsen.Huntford deftly delineates the hubris of the 19th century British gentleman, and his confidence in his destiny to be the master of the earth. Scott expects that by behaving in proper British fashion, success will by rights follow. In contrast Amundsen learns from the eskimo, the ""savages"" who have succeeded in living in the Arctic for generations, whose lessons Scott ignores.Scott fails and becomes a hero. Amundsen succeeds but makes it look too easy, and fails to capture the imagination and respect of the public.A wonderful book."
5,Just read it!,"Inspiring. Incredible comparative analysis of good and bad leadership, importance of thorough and timely planning and decisive execution. Pay attention to Amundsen's strength of reasoning and ability to efficiently address both strategy and deep operational details."
2,Huntford lunges for the jugular,"Although this book was well-written and exhaustively researched, I am wondering why Roland Huntford wrote it with such hatred. He tears Scott apart, sometimes jumping to unwarranted conclusions. Even if he does think that Scott sat in his tent, staring at a companion and willing him to die, he should not put such an idea into a book as a fact. Huntford paid little or no attention to the fact that Scott did have supporters and friends such as Edward Wilson and Apsley Cherry-Garrard. He was *not* unswervingly pigheaded, panicky and stupid as the book makes him out to be. Although this book was informative and made a much-needed point, I think that Huntford would have been better off presenting facts, and turning his point away from Scott's throat."
5,A powerful study in leadership,"If I were still a military commander, I would require every one of my subordinate officers to read this book. The story is so compelling and fascinating that it reads better than the best mystery novel. By the time you are done reading it, you will ""know"" these historical figures like old friends. But, aside from that, this book is a powerful study of leaderhip, character, relationships, and even culture. The book evoked in me a strong period of self-examination...in whose footsteps was I treading?Certainly, there are controversies surrounding Huntley's conclusions, and his treatment of Scott. I suspect these issues will be debated and disagreed over for years to come. Huntley's attacks on Scott may be, at times, overly biased. I won't pass judgment here, but rather I would encourage the reader to judge on his or her own. I suspect anyone who reads this book will want to read more about the men of antarctic exploration."
2,magnetic therapy,This did not work for me. Its very hard to put on. and the metal sticks dig into you. Not made well.
4,very good,I got it before it was said to be here and it was packed well. I will say I will buy something else from this place.
4,very good,it was good for the purpose I need it thank yoy very much. it was helpful the only problem is the size too small it finished fast. thank you very much.
5,Under-rated!,"This is one of the best groups from the 80's. Not one bad song on this album. Some of the most moving, varied songs and beautifully written lyrics... the other reviewer is correct to say - if this group was marketed well, they would a top hit group. Talent and looks, what more can you want in a rock band? The album can be had for very little these days. Pick it up and give yourself a treat. You will be floored. Way under-rated, I say."
5,An Enoch Light Vinyl Collector,"I bought this CD right away when I see it at the local store! I discovered Enoch Light records when I was collecting vinyl records, and I was amazed by the way the ""quality of sound and fidelity"" of his records. And this was back in the '50s and ""60s. I'm planning to buy the rest Enoch Light reissues on CD."
5,Awesome CD You Might try the Vinyl too,Everything I own and have heard from Enoch Light on the Command Record Label is nothing shy of fantastic! 60s pop music at its finest. Enoch Light invented audiophile. This CD sounds great but so do my albums. I wonder about the analog to digital transfer on this recording. Maybe I'm spoiled by the old virgin Vinyl & my tube phono stage but I would still recommend you buy. You can't go wrong with Enoch.
2,Fair,"I think ""Persuasive Percussion"" is my all time favorite. So I went ahead and purchased ""Provocative Percussion"" --- Not impressed with this one. That's OK, I'll just give it to someone as a gift, but I won't miss it."
4,HORRIBLE INSTRUCTIONS,"This weight machine is pretty nice. Very well built and has lots of nice features and offers a wide variety of exercises that can be done. The downfall are the assembly instructions!!! They are horrible! By far the worst I have ever seen with any type of product! It's basically a few pages with some hard to understand pictures. If you purchase this be prepared to spend considerable time putting it together and you should have someone in the group with some engineering experience. Shipping was pretty bad as well although not the fault of the manufacturer. The carrier canceled 4 delivery appointments and each time we had extra guys and a forklift waiting for the truck to arrive. Called Amazon about this twice and never really spoke to anyone that I could understand. Apparently their call centers our outsourced to a foreign nation. All that said, it is a good machine though."
1,Does'nt make dollars and sense !,Why would one purchase Season 1 Volumes 1 and 2 for $80.00 when you can purchase them individually for about $25.00 tax included.
5,As Good as It Gets,"Excellent video quality. Clean presentation of the shows in chronological order. Every Perry Mason fan should at least try out one of these DVDs.Perry plays tricks against the Court in some of the early episodes. He settles down somewhat later on, saving his cleverness for the police. Perry's logic, clarity, and acerbic insight when defending a client comes through as fun to watch. Yet, with all his ability as a major lawyer, he still has to pull out of deep trouble in every show.""What are You doing here, Tragg?"" ... ""Oh, hello Perry. I was just in the neighborhood and thought I'd drop by ... and arrest your client for MURDER."""
1,Horrible,"When I bought these, I figured they would be space saving, but it's totally not worth it. I recorded a video one side of them which worked fine, but once I used the other side, the data became unreadable on both sides. Nice idea, not ready for sale. Stay away from these and just go with the 20 pack single sided discs for 5 dollars more."
4,Memorex 2 sided DVD's,Love these double sided discs. Have never had a problem with them. I especially like the fact that I can get up to 1 hr. on a single disc by using both sides. I use them with a Sony camcorder.
5,Surprisingly good,I was looking for a protective filter for my lens and I didn't even know Sigma made filters. I bought the filter locally and it was the same price as Amazon's. The built quality is in par with higher priced filters.
5,Works good...,There's not a lot to say. As far as I can tell the filter doesn't affect my pictures at all. It's good to know my lens is safe having this.
5,Real Coated not like that Tiffen crap,"This filter actually has a coating just like your expensive camera lens. Keeps your pictures from becoming hazy.Most other brands which say ""multi coated"" are simply lying."
4,"Review for ""Fashions for Small Dolls""","This is a wonderful little book for those interested in making their own doll clothes for dolls 7 inches through 12 inches tall. The beautiful photo section gives the sewer many examples and ideas for all types of clothes. The back of the book contains patterns for all the doll clothes shown in the book in all the sizes. The directions section, in the middle, does require some reading but is well written. Fabric choices are discussed, as well as embellishment, patterns, sewing tips and construction. There is a very handy table for doll measurements included. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys and is interested in creating beautiful and unique doll clothes."
4,Small Doll Fashion,"The book is beautiful and there is a wealth of information concerning different sizes and body types of dolls. I wish there were more detailed instructions concerning the actual sewing. The instruction section seems to assume you already have her first book or are an experienced seamstress. For instance, she has a drawing on pg. 86, labelled ""How to make narrow bias tubing for ties or shoulder straps"" but no text accompanies the drawing! I'm glad I purchased it and will definately learn from it."
2,"restrictive writing, bad print","I received a book copy of poor print quality. I'll use the same phrase from another reviewer ""The very first time I opened the book the pages started to fall out."" The authors use unusual words from technical books of this area. This makes reading difficult for people who are not native English speakers. See the comment of another reviewer, ""If Mr. Bolen spent more time editing his material is grammar and comprehension rather than using 'pretty' words, this would be a much better text."" The vast majority of examples and theoretical focus are restricted to USA situations. I do not recommend the book to students of other nationalities who wish to know the theme ""wildlife management"" as a whole."
5,Wildlife Ecology and Management,This is one of the few textbooks that I have ever been able to read for pleasure. The text is well-sprinkled with interesting and useful citations.
1,"Good content, bad book","The content of this book is good and well written; however, I have been very disappointed with the quality of the publishing. I purchased this book brand new from Amazon and received it in the plastic from the publisher. The very first time I opened the book the pages started to fall out. Now, three weeks into class, I am carrying around the book in a plastic bag to try to keep all of the pages in order and from getting completely destroyed. After paying an exorbitant price for this book in new condition, the very least I would expect was for the book to be properly bound. Now, I can only expect that I won't be able to resell it at the end of the semester."
4,Wildlife Ecology and Management Review,"This textbook is very easy to read and includes a great deal of diagrams, pictures and illustrations to increase understanding. It explans technical terms thoroughly, and provides the scientific names of animals in the text."
4,Wildlife Ecology and Management,"It's a textbook! I have no basis for comparison or description of how good this book is. It reads Well, though...easy to read, that is.Interesting...meant to be read by an American- appeals to an American reader through examples and case studies, but could still be interesting and of course, useful to anyone studying North America and Europe."
5,great product,"I used to work in a powder coating plant, and was bumped into one of the iron racks that had been cooking in the oven. my arm hit the rack and the skin that made contact stayed on the rack. I used these until the skin grew back over the 3 inch wound on my arm. I have no scars to show for that because of this product. It's truly amazing."
4,Very good stories!,"Usagi Yojimbo, is a ronin, a masterless samurai who is travelling the MUSHA SHUGYO ( Warrior Pilgrimage ) to hone his spiritual and martial skills, in his travelling these 10 stories form this book, with the good storytelling of Stan Sakai and the evocative world of the feudal Japan from the XVI centuryIn this volume we are introduced to three important characters and the stories behind them. The most important is the story of Inazuma a young woman converted in Samurai with a reward upon her head. Then the story of Sanshobo a priest who was a HATAMOTO ( banner-man )and resign that life retiring himself to a monastery. The last story is about a man, Jei, who see himself like an instrument of gods to destroy the evil. We'll find again these characters in the volume ""Grasscutter"" and can read more of this fascinating story: the adventures of Usagi Yojimbo. You will not regret to buy this book."
4,Standard quality fare The setup for Grasscutter,"Yet another series of Usagi Yojimbo comics collected in Graphic novel format.As always the story and the art are great. The introduction of Inazuma and the story of Noodles are the high point of this book. The introduction of priest Sanshobo will also lead to important tales in the future.That being said there is nothing particular to distinguish this volume from the others that jumps out at you. This was a transitional period in the comic and the stories reflect it, but it is the reason why I call it standard quality fare. The quality is high but that is the standard I have expected and recieved from Mr. Sakai for decades.However this fare is deceptive as this will set up the Grasscutter stories to follow.Buy it."
5,beach chair,"I love it, its comfortable, and the fabric is sturdy. It is practically weightless hen carrying it as a backpack and the bog pocket in the back fits a towel and all the other small gadgets that you want at the beach with you!I like it, I have been through many neach charis but this one has everything one."
1,piece of junk,"I used the chair once....on my way back from the beach, one of the shoulder straps broke (actually, the one thread that was holding it to the frame unravelled..the other is on it's way to the same fate). I got in touch with customer service, they were nice, but when I told them that the box the chair came in was unusable for return, they told me to get another, at their expense (easier said than done for a large object)So I am using the chair with safety pins (till I find time to sew the strap back together)"
2,Not so good!,"We used this product while camping and two feet away from the dispenser was my husband. Needless to say, he recieved four mosquito bites in less than a minute, by the same mosquito! I don't think this works very well. I would suggest the BUG BANDS instead. You wear them around your wrist or ankle and they are DEET FREE as well. The bug bands completely protected my family on a recent camping trip from insect bites. None of us recived any and we wore the wrist bands constantly."
1,Don't waste your money,"I was very disappointed with this book. After reading it, you're left wondering, Where's the meat? The writer reguritates basic small business management practices without providing any real insight into the specific challenges of running a care home for the elderly. Those who want details on marketing this kind of business, meanwhile, are told to buy the author's marketing book. Judging from this work, though, you'd be smart to save your money."
3,The Beatles Collection,"I was disappointed because the picture looks like the new digital song collection. Instead, it was 4 Beatle movies on VHS. I think a more realisitic picture should be used for this product."
3,a little disappointed,"I was hoping to get some tips that I haven't tried yet. I have a 12 year old daughter with Asperger's Syndrome and a 10 year old son with autism. My son is non-verbal and extremely sensitive when it comes to new foods. The author did a great job in telling parents not to feel guilty about shortcomings in their child's diet. There are lots of options when it comes to supplements. However, I was disappointed in the way she dismissed The GF/CF diet. It was fun to read because having to ""translate"" British phrases reminded me of reading the ""Harry Potter"" books. I'd like to say it would be a good book for someone with a newly diagnosed child but, I'd be concerned that people who read it might give up too easily on any special diets."
3,"Some helpful parts, but rather dull","I would have liked to read more personal experiences from the author in this book. She had some helpful tips, but the book was more clinical than I care for. I respond better to a personal account.When I wrote my book, Cameron's Journey, which is about my youngest child, I tried to make it more personal and touching. He has a high-functioning form of Autism, called Asperger's Syndrome. I wanted to connect to the reader, to let them know that they are not alone.The author of this book succeeded in letting the reader know that the issue of eating problems in Autism Spectrum disorders is common, but I believe she failed to make a personal connection with the reader."
4,You Are Not Alone,"Children on the autistic spectrum can be fussy as well as sensitive eaters. This book aims to provide parents facing these particular sort of difficulties with support and advice. I identified with a lot of things in this book. If you think that other parents, teachers, and health professionals don't, can't and won't understand what it is to have a child so fussy that they would rather starve than eat something the wrong shape or colour, then if nothing else this book will show you that you are not alone."
5,Great Muffler - 1990 Toyota Corolla,Arrived on time. No damage. Easy to install and sounds great. Nice and quiet and is like original equipment. No extra parts needed for installation. Recommend for purchase and to a friend.
1,What a waste,"With the scarcity of video available of this music, I was very eager to watch this especially after reading the first two reviews. But half way through my wife and I looked at each other and wondered how embarrassing it was to watch. Did they ever rehearse ? Although the video is excellent for a small club, and I'm not sure there were more than 20 people there because far less than that were clapping for an encore, the music was really poorly delivered.What a waste ...."
3,DVD-RW,"When these disc's work they are great, but there are too many of them that have skips in them, so I miss what I have recorded. Music or movies it doesn't matter, what a bummer."
4,blank dvd discs,"I have tried different blank discs for my dvd recorder, however it seems that this is only one of two companies that work with my brand. I was fortunate to find them."
3,So so,"Out of 5 used from the set, 2 won't work and they now require ""formatting"" whereas those of this brand purchased 5 years ago just popped in and worked. Will be interesting to see if I can re-record on them as many times as I did on the older ones. Right now they act just like Motorola, which is not a good thing."
1,Avoid at all costs,"These re recordable blanks are not suitable for use with a Pioneer DVR. They won't finalize properly and end up being ejected by other DVD players after being recorded on. It is becoming harder and harder to find DVD blanks that will function properly. Most of the new offerings by Sony, Maxcell, Verbatim, etc. are made in China and feature a low reflective data side. I continue to have trouble finalizing with these brands using my Pioneer 510H DVR. Pioneer says they are hearing a lot of complaints. They suggest using FUJI or TDK. Good luck..."
2,Not what I thought,"I bought the more expensive -rw because a review had said you could delete and use space within the dvd. It might be my recorder but this is not so. When I delete mid dvd, my recorder says it will not increase capacity. Nor can I view on another player without first finaliZing, which is a pain since that gets rid of the thumbnail pictures and only shows time and date. And to delete select titles I have to unfinalize...grrr...not so with +rw.These are much more expensive and the hassle factor is much greater...back to +rws I go."
3,Maxell branded discs are actually Ritek discs,I bought these believing they were Maxell's but when I insert them into my disk drive they are recognized as Ritek discs. If you are looking for Maxell media they are not here in this item. After a few writes some of these discs aren't recognized by computer and rendered totally useless. What a disappointment it is to purchase Maxell and get Ritek instead.
1,A waste of Money,I ordered these DVDs in February 2010 I have not been able to use one of them. There were a lot in the pack for the money but it is a waste if you cant use them.
1,Bill Kerschner,The DVD Discs did not work on either of my two Sony DVD Players. I have written the Dealer but have had no response. Next time I will buy only from a store and not over the internet!
3,Slow Write Speed,"I'm happy with the quality and performance of these discs, although I might not have bought them if the write speed had been prominently listed. That said, I'm still happy with them. Perhaps a slower writing speed leads to a better quality recording? Pricewise, they are not a barn burner bargain, but they're competitive. They are doing the job for me."
1,I can not re-write it,"I have tried two DVDs of this pack, and both of them can not be re-written. So I am not satisfied with it at all."
1,Useless and waste of money,"I just recieved this item today, so far I used three of them without success. I tried to burn some videos but kept telling me that the DVD not compatible."
1,"Not a good product, very dissapointed.","Very slow writing speed, and it won't play on my computer, nor on my pioneer dvd player. Wasted money, I won't buy any more maxell. Very disapointed."
1,Not so great,"I bought these along with a DVD recorder. Out of 5 discs I've tried, only one worked. I was going to return the DVD recorder but decided to try another pack of DVD-RW's purchased at our local store. So far, 4 out of 4 discs from the store work fine and the DVD recorder does not have to go back. I think I'll not buy DVD's from Amazon in the future... I'll spend the little extra and purchase them locally to make sure I'm not going to get B-stock or defective discs."
1,Something Wrong with These DVDs,"I order 2 units. One unit shipped to me had a broken case. For some reason, these did not record accurately, though I'd had no problem with Maxells in the past. In one case, a three hour program only recorded two hours and eleven minutes. In another case, an hour program only had forty minutes recorded. I ran to the store and bought another brand of DVD-RW and have had no problem with them. I returned these Maxells for a refund."
5,As Good As Original,I chose the Maxell DVD's because of the price and have been more than pleased with them. I have already recorded about 5 of them and each of them has been free of defect. I've deleted and re-recorded several TV programs & NBA Games and had no problem with them. I highly recommend these. I only wish I had gotten more. But I will be ordering them again because delivery was on time and a special value to me under Amazon's 'Eligible for Free Shipping' program. Thank you Amazon and thank you Maxell - keep providing us with a dependable product.
2,BE CAREFUL WITH THIS PRODUCT,"I WAS TAKEN BY THE LOW PRICE. DOES NOT WORK WELL WITH SONY DVD PLAYERS.LUCKLY I HAVE SONY DVD RECORDER WHICH IT WORKS BETTER. THE PLAYER SHOWS A ERROR MESSAGE. WHICH SAYS ""CAN'T PLAY THIS DISC"". THIS HAPPENS ABOUT 60% OF THIS TIME."
3,The Story from the Movie,"The Molly Maquires, James O'NeillThe ""truth"" about the Molly Maguires is that it depends on the viewpoint of the beholder.I saw the movie years ago and don't remember much today. It was said to be inspired by the book ""Lament for the Molly Maguires"", which is as much entertainment as history.Hollywood produces entertainment, if you want history read a book."
4,Fine adaptation,A well-written screenplay novelization based on the excellent 1970 Hollywood film and true story of the Molly Maguires in the coal regions of Pennsylvania of the 1870s.
1,"Purchased five sets, ALL had material FLAWS--SECONDS","I love Emile Henry cookware. But, not these dishes.These sets were a big disappointment. ALL the pieces had substantial flaws. All of the mugs had bumps in the glaze. Some of the bumps were sharp. Some were located where your mouth would rest on the mug when drinking. Other flaws included deep pits and one of the plates had been ""ground off"" on the bottom at a funny angle.I would not recommend this purchase."
2,Disappointing...,"This book was not the vintage visual feast of chinoiserie I had hoped for. Apart from a beautiful cover, it is not much more than a standard, unexceptional exhibition catalogue. No pictures in color, and not much depth or context into the style, the lives of the creators, or lifestyles surrounding it..."
1,Don't buy from this guy!D,"This company is a crook. I e-mailed them several times and got no response. Then like a stupid person, I shipped this printer back and got no refund or any correspondence. Stupid Me, don't buy anything from this company!!"
3,"Looks great, but not the best value for an iPod Touch","I took a chance that it would work with the iPod Touch, but it seems to be hit or miss.The charging works great via computer and the provided AC adapter, but I kept getting a connection error via iTunes. [I think Vista is assuming it's a digital camera.]For those interested in my setup, I'm running Windows Vista, iTunes version 7.6.1.9 and have a 16gb iPod Touch (1.1.4 with software upgrade). The universal adapter fit, but didn't seem to improve connectivity.It's not a total bust since I can use it as a stylish charging cradle, I just wish I could sync with it as well.Update: I was able to finally get iTunes to recognize the iPod. It only seemed to work on one of my front USB ports.Quick note - 07/12/08: Upgrading to 2.0 pretty much renders this useless. It will recharge, but iTunes will not recognize an iPod has been attached."
2,worked great at first,"this seemed like a great deal, charge your IPOD and listen to it at the same time and it comes with a remote to control the IPOD when it's in the dock, but the quality of this product was lacking for sure, after a couple of weeks the port that connects to your IPOD would not fit anymore and in fact on one of my machine it made it so the IPOD wouldn't fit any other plug after that."
5,Great tools,I reviewed some of the other reviews to determine if these wrenches would be worth the price. Once i received these the wrenches are in great condition and they are well made. Great item for the price and the carry case is great so those wrenches are not loose in the tool box.
1,Error messages in first use,"Unfortunately the first time I used this I received an error message. Something like FNRL. When I called CS they said I probably used the searing incorrectly. I heated up the grill, waited for it to reach temp. Then I placed meat on grill and hit the SEARING feature. The searing high 525 degree temp stayed on for way too long, then gave me the error message. (It is supposed to only stay on 90 seconds, then revert back to the pre-programmed temp). It would not clear. I had to unplug and wait for it to cool down.The next day I tried it the way CS suggested: I programmed it to the temp I wanted, but did not wait for it to reach the temp. I then put the meat on the grill and hit the SEARING feature. Once again, the error message!CS has never heard of the error message I gave them. I spent too much money on this to keep getting error messages. Very annoying. Just too complicated to use the SEARING feature.I returned this unit and would not recommend."
2,only OK,grills OK but have to agree with others that cleaning process makes this seldom used. Can only open 90 degrees which makes it a bit difficult to clean the top grill plate. Better option would be find something with removable plates.
3,Foreman GFSG80,"The grill is good, I just prefer grilling outside but it rains here continously. I use the grill at least twice a week to grill fish and buffalo burgers and all turns out as expected. I miss the mesquite chips I use out of doors."
1,"Get something else, nothing worthwhile here...","Not well written. Mostly self serving diatribe of what the author thinks people want to read, as opposed to anything remotely considered decent thought.Buy anything else. Serious. I just saved you money."
1,Don't waste your $$,"I bought this so my two children could watch movies in our van. I played 2 dvd's in it, now it won't pull the dvd's in. I can't return it because it's been over 30 days. Don't waste your $$$ like I did."
5,Excellent Read! Couldn't Put It Down!,"The book is excellent. So much interesting drama! I am Korean and Korea's Chosun Dynasty is also full of Queens and deceit and back stabbing and I realized how England's Kingdom was very similar to Korea's. I suppose King & Queens are kind of similar in their nature to keep the power given to them. Anyway, I bought 2 other Alison Weir books because she just writes wonderfully. Knowing this is history which can be boring, but not so for this wonderful book. If you are a history buff like myself, you will love this book. One thing though, I read my book on subway trains and on buses while I commute to work, and this book too heaaaaaaaaaaaavvvvvvvvvy! I guess that would be only minus for this book."
5,I'm Henry the Eighth I Am,"Henry VIII is a fascinating man of history. He took six wives, arranged to exchange one wife for another, murdered two, lost one to childbirth, rejected another and died before he could find a way to get rid of wife six. A man of wit, intelligence, excess and greed. He had an enormous appetite for pleasure, riches and love. You'll feel as if you're reading exceptional fiction but it really happened."
5,Henry was a bad boy,"This is an excellent account of Henry and his many wives. Well researched, very well written - there's hardly a boring passage."
5,Easy and interesting read,"I don't read much nonfiction, but I really enjoyed this. It was an enjoyable read, and I would absolutely recommend it."
3,A Great Book,"The Six Wives of Henry VIII was more about Henry VIII than it was his wives. A lot of information was given about Tudor history, the political state of Britain and Henry himself, but there was a lack of information on his wives. Katherine of Aragon was portrayed pretty well, but after that Henry's wives were not described in depth. The book never told how each women actually felt. Their births, parents, lives and marriage was chronicled in detail, but their feelings and personalities didn't have much play at all. The book is historically well written, easy to understand and was overall very intersting and gripping."
3,Detailed history,"This book is very detailed and informative. Fascinating history. It reads like a novel. However, sometimes the details bogged me down."
4,Must read one of Weir's best,"Very informative, sometimes a bit wordy but its vey hard to give the details of certain events without explaining what occurances led up to the fact so well worth the read."
1,its a history textbook,"If you enjoy reading history textbooks, this is definetly for you. I got so bogged down in it, I couldnt even get half way through. I love Tudor history but this is just painful. At least Phillipa Gregory adds some imagination to it so the characters come alive."
5,"Impressive book, riveting story","What I liked most about this book is also what since distresses me most about films circulating on this topic. Weir so thoroughly researches the profusion of biographic material available (besides Britain, courts throughout Europe had documention on the wives of Henry and him) that it is clear there is no need to fictionalise this fascinating story (you wouldn't even try to imagine it). And although it lends itself so well to a series (or a film) once you have read this book the inaccuracies in (Gregory's, for example) fictionalisions on the screen tend to get annoying. Wonderful book -the story is historic and timeless at the same time. (If you can recommend a good, unembellished biographic DVD, please do.)"
5,Truth is better than Fiction!,"This is the best history I've read on the subject, and I would recommend any one read it who is interested in the goings-on of the English monarchy in the 16th century. Henry VIII has been protrayed time and again as a wanton,lusting glutton. The bottom line is that he was desperate for a male heir, and he would do anything to have a son. Personnally, I was amazed that he didn't just legitimize his son, the Duke of Richmond. But, then history would have turned out entirely different."
4,Informative,"I was interested in reading this since it covered all 6 wives. The first half of the book is Katherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn, since they are probably the most interesting/most well known of the wives. I thought this was easy to read, although it took a while. Not because of the subject or style but that it's a large book. I think it would be difficult for someone with little to no knowledge of the subject to read this as it would be difficult to keep people/stories straight. I think Alison Weir is biased toward/against all of them and I'm not so sure the opinions are factually based. Interesting read if you are interested in this subject though. As for a history book, it's not boring or slow at all. I would gladly read more of Weir's work."
5,nice book,"The reason I want to buy the book is that when I was watching the TV series-the Tudors, I was attracted by the magic life of Henry VIII. But as we all know the pace of TV show is slow. And I m not patient enough. That's why I choose to buy this book. The day I opened this book, I was absorbed to it totally. It is so interesting and real. From this book, I knew quite a lot interesting details which were not described in the TV series. So I recommend it to u."
2,Superb Work,"When I purchased this book, I was skeptical because I thought it might be another dull book about English history. I was absolutely wrong - this is a great book! Weir does a great job of telling this story. It is not six separate biographies. Instead, Weir weaves the story of each wife around the life of Henry VIII. Ann of Cleves is a particulary sad story, and she comes across as the most likable of Henry's wives. On the other hand, Ann Boleyn is portrayed as a scheming, ill-tempered snob who constantly meddles in the affairs of state, which ultimately leads to her unfortunate death. Henry is accurately portrayed as a controlling and sometimes distant husband and father. You won't be disappointed in this book - it's one of Weir's best works."
5,Alison Weir or the Seventh Queen of Tudor England,"From ""the"" authority of Tudor England, ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII"" truly grasps in a very vivid style the continuous challenges, tribulations, manipulations and vicissitudes that each queen had to negotiate in order to survive. The book is downright brilliant; it is history, but reads like a novel. The prose is colorful and exquisitely worded. Yet two aspects sort of got me thinking: (a) the almost detachment of Thomas More during the course of passing the Act of Succession and (b) the lack of evidence on Anne Boleyn's adultery case. If I had to bestow a description to each queen, I would call Katherine of Aragón the most virtuous, Anne Boleyn the most dangerous, Jane Seymour the most fulfilling, Anne of Cleves the most pragmatic, Katherine Howard the most reckless and Katherine Parr as the most universal. In all, a masterful job."
4,Eye opening read,"I truly enjoyed reading this book. I consider myself to be fairly knowledgeable of English history, and I was astonished at how much I do not know of this time period! Ms. Weir has a quick moving style and does not allow herself to be bogged down in needless detail, yet still provides the reader with a great deal of essential and interesting facts. She paints a very full picture of both Henry VIII and his many wives."
4,Great Read,After reading all the Philippa Gregory books about Tudor England I became really interested in that period in English history. I wanted to read some non-fiction so I ordered this after reading all the reviews. I was afraid it would be a little dry. Happily it wasn't!! I found it to be a relatively fast read and very interesting! My only criticism would be that Anne Boleyn's section of the book was a little long and drawn out.
5,Easy read,"I love history. Henry is more human then I had believed, but also more of a monster with no regrets of how he handles getting rid of his wives then I would have thought. Would recommend"
5,Fantastic reading!,Was wonderful reading!! I enjoy almost everything about the Tudors. This was one of the most comprhensive readings on them that I have ever seen. Gave lots of tidbits not known before. Very heavy paperback but had it entirely read in about 2 1/2 weeks.
5,A really great book!,I read this book in about a week because it was very good and well written. I really enjoyed it and wish it would have not ended! Providing a historical account and adding in little tidbits about each individual character really made the book special. It reads well and really flows. I cannot wait to dive into her other books!
4,Great historical treatise,"I read this book after watching the series ""The Tudors"" on Netflix and loved the author's effort to report historical accuracy. This book read like a novel instead of a biography. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys nonfiction and history."
5,Incredible,"I could not put this book down. This book provides a thorough history of not only each wife of King Henry, but also a history of Henry and England itself during the period. The book is easy to follow, laid out in chronological order. The book also addresses the issues from the wive's point of view. Very engrossing, an incredible read that made history very vibrant and alive."
5,Weir outdoes herself!,"The best of Weir's books, this telling of the notorious Henry Tudor brings his entire court (and courtships!) to vivid life... Interesting storytelling and characterization, with plenty of lavish details, make this page turner an absolute must-have for your library."
1,"Outdated material, terrible customer service, faked photo's","I used to enjoy this magazine but as it's states ALL OVER the web. They have really had problems. The pictures are (they admit) faked and not live action. The product reviews are simply cut and paste from the customers website (no actual review) and its about half the size it used to be with 1/2 the content. Most being from the same ole advertisers. Yes, it used to be a good source, but in the last couple of years it has really gone down hill. There are several other good choices on Amazonfor Texas Fishing and hunting. I would seriously consider those...Sorrythe truth hurts Texas Outdoor fans."
3,A pleasant film to watch...,"Made by the Taviani brothers, ""Elective affinities"" is well..., not exactly up to expectation. The film is simple and precise, which I find quite pleasant. It is based on a novel by Goethe, and the story shows how human lives are unable to match mathematical formulas.(Quite frankly, I find it curious matching something as illogical as emotions with something rational.) As the plot goes... A woman engages her lover and then, wed. They settle in on his estate and then the husband's friend arrives for a visit, at almost the same time the women's young daughter appears. Hmm... wonder what's going to happen?However... some scenes tend to be routine though, which I didn't particularly like. But, overall... an agreeable film to watch... 3 stars."
5,One of Pablo's best,"Cavalleria Rusticana has a few recordings out there but this version is one of the best - Pablo Elvira is stunning, and Placido Domingo and Renata Scotto are smooth as butter. This is one of the best things James Levine conducted outside the MET!"
3,don't have high expectations-may have some spoilers!!!!,"I should have waited for it to be on cable, lets put it that way. It was not great but not bad either. Nothing new or original at all. Same old story. Father messed up before, is trying to be a good guy now. There is action but the kind of action that has been seen and done so many times before. A Supposed to be twist, but can't pull that one off. So there it is. Too bad I can't write more about it. Not alot of meat to it. I love action movies and I watch alot of movies, this one I have to say I am Not impressed with. Again, not bad but not great by any stretch."
4,Transit,An excellent movie with lots of action and thrills. Caviezel was superb as usual. I recommend this movie highly as keeping you on the edge of your seat.
4,Transit Review,"I love Jim Caviezel (a hottie) and James Frain (especially since he was in the Tudors). I find it impressive when an Englishman can pull off an American accent. The movie had a good plot line , one that I had not seen before, but I would also love to see a movie where a person uses their wits more than violence to solve problems. I look at the B&W movies from the 1950's and they did have a lot of violence and intrigue too, but we do have to consider what we are teaching the kids now."
3,totally misleading picture,"What you're getting here is:1000 (I didn't count them)single tip (cotton puff on only one end of the stick)wooden shaft (like I said ""stick"")non-sterile (10 stapled paper bags of 100 loose Q-TIPS each)If that's what you're looking for have at it. But don't let the photo fool you into thinking that there is any sort of individual wrapping here. There is none. If you want to carry one or two or a few of these in your wallet or purse you'll have to use a baggie or some sort of case.If anyone knows of a supplier of individually wrapped Q-TIPS please reply to this review."
1,"Boring Euro Junk From ""Jess"" Franco","As far as I'm concerned, most of Jesus Franco's films are pretty stinky, but DEVIL HUNTER is a low point even for him. If you're expecting a film along the lines of CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, you're going to be disappointed. Lots and lots of scenes showing characters running through the jungle, plus some cheesy gore effects and a naked ""monster man"" with inept makeup are about all you get here. DEVIL HUNTER is for completists only, and even most of them will feel cheated. Bottom line: don't waste your money on this ridiculous junk, even if it is remastered and uncut...some films are rare for the best of reasons."
2,It's Jess Franco - 'nuff said,"Silly story of a kidnapped Euro-babe and a wandering, bug-eyed mutant cannibal. As with most Franco films, there is little or no tension, poor f/x and a lot of female skin. Not one of those ""video nasties"" like Cannibal Ferox or Cannibal Holocaust: just tame and meandering. Being a Jess Franco film, it looks like it was shot in a day and a half; he's Europe's William ""One Shot"" Beaudine. So if you're hungry for a ""good"" cannibal film, look elsewhere; this one can wait."
1,Scratches Easily,"One main reason to use a filter such as this is for protection of an expensive lens. Obviously one wants excellent optical quality, so multi-coating is necessary. I have used filters such as this on all my lenses with great success, but I am disappointed with this filter. It scratches very easily when compared with other brands that I have used. I would recommend a high end Hoya or Tiffen. If you are a high end user, then go with a very expensive brand such as B+W. (If you want to be a perfectionist, don't use a filter at all! Just be prepared to buy replacement lenses more often. Truthfully, I've never had any issues with image quality when using a good filter, but I'm just an amateur who has a day job to support my habit.) Bottom line, I would suggest another brand."
4,Intermediate price filter,"Reasonable optically flat glass, good to protect more expensive telephoto lens. Third one which I've gotten to protect lenses. Cracked one filter, better than cracking lens."
2,Cheaply made...broke on first day...,"Well, you get what you pay for. It seems like most people forget about that. I took a chance on these because I don't think spending the big bucks for a B+W filter is worth it. And boy was I wrong. I got these in the mail from amazon and put it on my Nikkor 24-70mm lens. It was a bit hard screwing it on and i was struggling to take it off and eventually I got it off and the inner metal ring snapped. Back to amazon it went and I got myself a B+W right away. Stay away from these, save up and get a B+W."
5,Matched Pearls,"I had never read this book before , it was a great Grace Livingstion Hill book. The book came in great shape and in a speedy manner. Thank you."
2,Cult Movie Doesn't Live up to Reputation,"Salvation, directed by Beth B., who with husband Scott B. was one of the founders of the ""Cinema of Transgression"" (Nick Zedd, R. Kern) here attempts to make a movie with an actual plot. Though satyrizing the televangelist movement was a worthy target, Salvation comes off as a cross between the Rocky Horror Picture Show and Marjoe. Unlike the gritty no wave films of the 70's, Salvation seems more (relatively) polished but still the acting is on the level of a Paul Morrisey film. Gave a good prediction for Christian punk though."
5,Stunning Designs!,"I don't know how this woman can come up with such beautiful, detailed, unique designs! They are gorgeous, and I actually like each and every design in the book. There are many drawn pictures that tell the exact order of beads in addition to written instructions, making it easy to follow. I recommend this book to anyone who likes shiny, delicate, detailed jewelry who wants to be complimented!"
4,The Title Says It All,"Her designs use beads easily found and there is even a section where the same few types of beads are used to make several different styles; romantic, elegant, geometric, antique, etc. My only difficulity is that the directions are given solely in detailed drawings, very different from American books. You have to have enough experience to follow the path of the thread through the sketched beads with no written directions. She also seems to use two needles, working from the middle of the design out, most of the time. Once you get used to it, though, every piece is remarkable."
4,di3moose,"The items are absolutely beautiful in this book. Instructions are not too hard to follow, but some of the findings are impossible to find, leaving you to substitue. Some of the bead sizes are given in cm instead of mm. Overall, the projects are gorgeous!!"
2,Disappointing,I bought Bead Fantasies and Bead Fantasies II at the same time after reading the positive reviews; I wish I had looked at these books before buying. There are pretty motifs that I will incorporate into my beading projects but I find the small typed directions overly simplistic and the diagrams are too small. I'm glad this isn't my first beading book or I would feel totally discouraged from trying any of these projects. I won't be buying Bead Fantasies III. The Art and Elegance of Beadweaving and Coraling Technique remain my favorite beading books.
4,great book,"I like this book. The design are nice, but it would be better if there are more ideas of desinging beads."
4,"Beautiful designs, frustrating ""directions""","Her designs are exquisite, her ""directions"" had me pulling my hair until I finally figured out that she uses two needles on the same thread. My daughter, who loves making beaded jewelry, took one look, said ""You figure it out and show me!"" Once I finally had her technique figured out, though, the results are just beautiful! (By the way, the occasional strategically placed knot helps considerably!) Her ""necklance with seed bead motifs"" made with Swarovski crystals is to die for and I made matching earrings with the same motifs. My advice? If you can follow diagrams rather than words, gather your patience and buy the book, you'll love it!"
3,Beautiful pictures---not so great instructions,"I was very excited to get this book. The descriptions I had read sounded great and the pictures looked wonderful. Unfortunately the instructions weren't so great. They follow along like most japanese bead books. With a diagram and very few actually word instructions, leaving you to puzzle out how to actually do it. If you like japanese style instructions you'll love this book, if not it does have great pictures."
2,POOR QUALITY,"The story is interesting, but the poor quality makes it hard to enjoy. The colors are washed out and it is pan-and-scan. I think this film tried to show the vast emptiness of the west but the cinematography is lost in this DVD. I think(although I don't know) that this edition has been edited. There are a couple of abrupt splices. As it is, a few unsettling scenes remain. Just as an aside, Michele Carey has a very strange voice. Almost like a cartoon character or small child. She's a stunner though. Geneon [Pioneer]"
4,A powerful film.,"Some of the scenes in this movie are so horrifying that they are difficult to watch, but they are presented as an unflinchingly honest picture of what people can do to each other. Other reviewers have told the plot, sometimes relating spoilers that give everything away. But I disagree with them on several counts.The most sympathetic person is the Apache played by Henry Silva. Furthermore, he and the other Native Americans wear authentic garb, not ""costumes.""Keenan Wynn gives a great portrayal of a truly despicable character, and you'll love what happens to him. That, and the other events that conclude the film, make sense if you keep an open mind about it. And it's obvious what is about to happen as the movie ends.As for the video quality: don't expect a Criterion release. But the West is shown as it undoubtedly was: blazingly hot, dry, and merciless.P.S. This film is also known in the U.S. as ""The Animals,"" and in Canada as ""The Desperadoes."""
5,"Excellent sunblock, very water resistant!","This sunblock is excellent, it won't run into your eyes when you sweat. It goes on cool and absorbs quickly. It has a very light feel on the skin."
5,Great!,"For this price, this is one of the best case deals that I've seen. Especially when you consider the quality and craftsmanship found within the Sena Case line. If you have an X50 series Axim and are in need of a new case, the Sena X50 series case might just cover you perfectly."
5,Interactive and wholesome entertainment,This cartoon character is wonderful for younger children. The music is fantastic and the storylines are exciting without being brash. My little one year old has already learned a lot from the shows. He loves to watch and dance to the music. I would highly recommend it.
1,John Wayne Collection - 5 Pack,"These 10 movies in 5 DVDs from Madacy Entertainment are of the poorest quality that you will find. Most of them look like they are 5th generation copies of VHS tapes that were then copied to DVD. I was looking forward to adding to my collection of John Wayne DVDs, but I would not keep these if they gave them away. I will never buy another DVD from Madacy again."
5,Annual Reports,"I found this book to be an excellent review for experienced annual report readers and yet clear enough for readers unfamiliar with the material.Very readable with good, concise examples.I strongly recommend to anyone interested in a better understanding of corporate annual reports and financial statements."
3,Great for camping,"I bought this table to take in our trailer and to sit next to the grill when we are camping. It is very light weight and easy to store. Its perfect for setting plates, spices and stuff on while grilling, but definitely nothing much heavier. It's a good deal at $20.00 but I certainly wouldn't pay any more."
2,Not as expected,"Amazon's description does not even mention the fiberboard top. I bought this to use outside, in the rain. I would not have bought it if I knew the top was fiberboard. Top bows easily under finger pressure too."
1,poor,"this table's top foil is very soft,any thing you put on the top makes a dent and the top bends under a light load,the legs are stronger than the top."
2,NOT AS STATED,"I JUST OPENED BOX AND WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THAT IT IS 24IN, WIDE...NOT 30 AS ADD STATES...SEEMS FLIMSY ...wOULD RETURN IF NOT SUCH A HASSEL...."
4,I'm sure the other reviewer paid more than $5...,This item is priced at $4.99 right now. It's a great little toy and goes well with the house. I got it used off craigslist and it's still in prefect condition so it's very durable. I'd say it's worth $5 but definitely not worth more than $10.
2,CHEAP,"MY girl loves it and plays withit all the time that's great, but it is way over priced for what you get, I call it cheap China junk."
5,I love these!,"I figured if theses were Jimmy Page's pick of choice, I should give them a try. Nice grip and just the right thickness. I also bought the Herco 50 at the same time. Those are too thin for me, way too flexible."
5,why buy expensive Hoya's or cheap Tiffens?,This is a very good multi-coated UV filter that I use on my 150mm Sigma Macro Lens. Great buy for the money..
3,Works well as lens protection,I don't see an improvement nor do I see a degrade in image quality. I guess this filter works well as lens protection if anything does happen.
5,sage,This was a lot better than I thought it would be. I love clensing my home after vistors. Keeps peace and joy in my home.
5,Finally!,"I'm so glad this CD, along with the other Camper stuff has been reissued outside of the box set. I still have my original tape that I played pretty much every day driving to my R.O.P. class at the Monterey Airport, or driving to Santa Cruz to try & find old records before the earthquake.My favorite CVB record!John HandsRed Room, Santa Cruz CA"
5,"Inspirational, moving!","My husband and I are both painters and absolutely loved this. Artist Barry Raybould recommended it to all of his students. Even for non-artists, it is just a great story! Enjoy."
2,Dull & Disappointing,"If you enjoy watching paint dry, you'll like this movie. Otherwise, save your money. Frankly, I'm baffled by other glowing customer reviews shown here. In my view, the BBC really missed the mark on this mini-series. If you want a more accurate account of and insight into the lives of the Impressionists, instead purchase ""The Impressionists: The Other French Revolution"", on DVD, an A&E production (2001)."
5,Such a great mini-series!,"I love this DVD. I enjoy watching it again and again! I bought myself and my father a copy. Great for anyone interested in painting, art or culture that also loves stories."
5,In my top 10 list,"I originally read this book after finding it in my local library back in the early 1990's. I ended up purchasing all three books (Son of the Hero, The Hero of Varay, and The Hero King) in paperback soon after. I was recently very pleasantly surprised to find all three available for the Kindle. Rick Shelley does an excellent job with the old destiny in an alternate dimension storyline, giving a fresh feeling. He does it with humor and sarcasm, along with a lot of writing skill. I highly recommend these three books.My only complaint at all is the somewhat high price of the Kindle edition. At $7.99 each they cost more than a lot of paperbacks. But, better to be available at a slightly expensive price, rather than not being available at all."
4,Great video,I liked the video but would not recommend it for people who have never practiced Tai Chi before. I would say it is a video for the intermediate Beginner. I like that it shows the individual movements as well as the complete form.
1,Way overpriced on amazon,"I've tried to leave feedback on this before but it just gets rejected...i just want to know why Amazon is selling this software for $449USD when they company sells it on their own website for $299USD and the Canadian Amazon site sells it for $368.18CDN, it just doesn't make any sense. However, the software itself looks great."
2,Little substance,"I was expecting a history of the Inquisition, instead I got a very wordy but not very coherant delineation of seeming not very connected facts."
3,NOT FOR BEGINNERS,"Although I am sure this is a great book, as other reviewers have stated, it is definately not for beginners, such as me. That is why I only gave it 3 stars. This book is difficult to read if you are not well versed on the terminology used, but I will continue to poke away at it. With that being said, I have no doubt it will become very useful in the future when I become more familiar with the subject."
3,Not All Piano!,As another reviewer stated this album has several tracks that feature saxophone. I didn't think this should be included! I also emphatically do NOT want to hear saxophone. I wanted a Jazz PIANO album. Just be advised that there is a whining Saxophone that makes no sense grinding reedily in a very irritating way.
1,An Ignorant Imperialist's Tour of Ireland,"I could hardly get past the introduction; I got 2 pages into the first chapter, flipped around a bit further in, and then gave up. It seems to be over 500 pages of some Englishman aping around pretending he knows Ireland and using some sort of horrible stereotype of Ireland's English, and doing it so poorly that it just comes across as offensive and demeaning. I recommend it to absolutely no one."
1,Not like before,"I used this product years ago and it worked nicely so I thought I would try it again. This time around was a disappointment, wasn't like it was before. I don't know if they changed the formula or what but it doesn't do much at all."
1,leptopril is bunk,"I have been using leptopril for over two weeks now and have no significant results, in fact, I am almost certain I've gained a little weight."
1,A waste of money!!!,"So after spending $40 something dollars on this product hoping for just some glipse of help and hope, nothing happened. It does nothing but make you edgy and gives you stomach pains. I thought I was developing some sort of an ulcer from it, so I stopped. Save your money for weight watchers. This doesn't work."
1,Rip off!!!,"I starting taking Leptopril about 3 weeks ago. I did not lose any weight and I felt very out of it the whole time. I had a constant headache and if I didn't eat every hour or so I got nauseous. I took them for so long hoping that my body would get used to the pills, but that never happened. Stay away from these pills!"
1,Leptopril Review,"Didnt like the product, did nothing for me. Didnt lose any weight whatsoever! I tried the HCG diet on here and at officialhcgstore.com and had better results on the HCG diet"
3,At Least It's Short,"Kabakov writes vividly, but to no particular point discernable to a non-Russian. ""No Return"" was urged on me by a former Ukranian, whose recommendations shall now be taken ""cum grano salis"". I am reminded of the final lines of ""The Three Cherry Sisters Karamazov""---""And though I've read the best of 'em,By Chekov and the rest of 'em,I haven't got the faintest idea whatthey're all about."""
2,Needs to be updated,"I'm fortunate that I purchased the Kindle edition and was able to get a full refund. I've been doing a lot of online research for my upcoming Rainier hike. We are hiking Disappointment Cleaver next month! This book has great reviews, so I bought it and instantly had it on my Mac. There was only 2 pages, maybe 2 paragraphs of Disappointment Cleaver. The same goes for all the routes. There is no way I'd feel comfortable hiking after reading just this book. I've found much more information on one google search. I then wondered why so many good reviews, they are all from the year 2000! Ok, the internet was new then. But now there are blogs and pictures of all these routes."
3,Guide for Climbing up Rainier,"This is a good book, written by one of the most competent guides on Rainier. It gives you the classic route (of which there are several variants) which I will hopefully attempt this spring and some much more challenging routes that involve much slogging through snow and crevasses which are only for the truly masochist among climbers.Also has good suggestions on how to get properly conditioned, food and water tips, as well as some grate advice on the real reason to hire a guide. Great book, and good value!Philip Corsano"
3,The book was okay,"The route descriptions are good but the book contains some fluff that I wasn't looking to read. Because the first several chapters focus on the basics, the overall impression I got from the book was that it was geared towards the non-technical or the inexperienced climber."
4,"This book is fat, not fluffy (when it comes to truth)","I almost never pick up a 'devotional' book. But Latayne Scott's book had a significant impact on my faith and my understanding of God's love. It is clear after reading her extremely personal look at Rahab the harlot that God's intention toward each of us is love. He loves us now, always has and always will. That's what I walked away with after reading this. The Red Cord of Hope is a challenge to reconsider how we view ourselves given our own shady histories. It teaches us how to view our past failings in the light of God's love. There are study exercises at the back which make this perfect for a small group bible study."
5,You'll Savor Every Moment Reading It!,"A must-have for your Junior League cookbook collection. Both cookbook and party planner, Savor the Moment offers delicious menus as well as party theme sugesstions. Treat yourself to this one. If you're technologically saavy, pick up the CD ROM, too. You'll be able to print up your menus, and head to the store in a snap!"
5,A must have book !!!,I am a collector of great cookbooks. This is one of the best cookbooks I have in my collection. The recipes are very diverse and fairly easy to prepare. No matter what the occasion you will find great recipes to serve your guests. This will replace many other books.
1,Hughesnet (Direcway) Satellite customers BEWARE!,"If you use either the DW6000 or DW7000 satellite modems and don't have a land-line telephone, DO NOT BUY TIVO! Despite what their website advertises, tivo series 2 DVRs cannot get programming updates over satellite internet. Tivo blames Hughesnet, and vice-versa. Tivo Customer Support is so bad I would put it in the same category with direcway/hughesnet. Calling is a waste of your time. They do not care. Tivo wouldn't offer me a refund after advanced technical support promised to extend my warranty until their engineering dept could provided an upcoming patch. When the patch failed to fix anything, they told me to change my Internet provider(like I could if I wanted to) or that I was simply out of luck. They offered to cancel my tivo service, but no refund. Amazing ineptitude.When DVRs work they are really cool. But buyer beware. There must be better DVRs out there. I sure hope so...."
3,Problems with modem,"For a short while, I loved my Tivo. But, then one day it just stopped communicating. I called Tivo and after an hour on the phone, they determined that the modem must have gone bad. It hasn't moved, wasn't jostled - ok whatever. So, since my 90 days was up, I had to pay another $49.00 and they sent a REFURBISHED machine that only has a 30 day warranty. And when I went to hook that Tivo up, it won't go past the powering up screen. So, I have to get yet another refurbished machine. What a pain. I checked out the message boards on the tivo site and it seems lots and lots of people have the same problem. I would just get the dvr feature from your cable company or satellite - not Tivo."
2,Love and Hate,"I loved my Tivo, but then it died. The customer service people are not very helpful; I think the company quits caring after they get your money. I am a huge fan of DVR's but will not buy a Tivo again. THe warranty is only 90 days and if you purchase the lifetime service, it is NOT transferable. That is the biggest con, my machine died after 12 months. Pro's include all the typical DVR features but keep in mind that you don't need Tivo to get these features."
4,Great machine,Does anyone know how this grey version Series 2 differs from the older black version Series 2?
3,Recording capacity is wrong,"Well, I like the IDEA of Tivo, but I have to say so far I'm a little miffed. Most important caveat -- the 40-hour recorder doesn't REALLY hold 40 hours of TV. Oh, it'll hold 40 hours on ""Basic Quality"" (which looks like fertilizer), but the capacty on ""High Quality"" is only 18 hours (""Best Quality"" is a measly 11). Only on ""Best Quality"" do you get something that apporximates what you see on Live TV, even high quality looks like an old VHS tape. So unless you only want to watch one show a week, go for the 80-hour. That's what I'm doing."
4,TIVo nearly all I expected,"Just like a computer is useless without the programing, the TIVo DVR is useless without the TIVo Service and your programing source. TIVo allows a person to save programs you might want to view and lets you view them when you want.Negatives:Used with Dish Network requires a signal from the Dishnet control after its daily update and TIVo doesn't give this signal.TIVo works with IR controlled Dish/cable boxes, and Dish Network has dual tuner box with one tuner IR and the other radio controlled, TIVo will only control the IR controlled tuner."
3,TiVo software is the problem,"I've tried both TiVo and RePlay units, my current prefered unit is an old Panasonic ShowStopper that I have upgraded. Yes one might have a better menu system but that's not the issue. The real issue is pause buffer time. TiVo's are limited to a 30 minute buffer ... this is a deal breaker for me. RePlay units allow you to buffer to whatever HDD capacity you may have. This is very very handy.Yes TiVo gets all the press but take a look at RePlay. But whichever you choose you will agree that these units will change the way you view TV. You might think you will start watching more TV but the opposite is what happened in my house. I've used DVR's since they were new on the market and they have given me more free time. With the 30 sec jump button I can watch an entire football game in less than an hour."
1,Look closer at TiVo.,"TiVo, when new is a great toy. But after the first year I questioned it's worth before renewing the subscription. What did it do? It copied programs, provided a program schedule, provided speed control Slowmo etc. and would record shows following what you choose. If you have cable or satellite you already have a program guild and after a few months of use I turned off the selective recording, ask it to record football and any program with foot and ball gets recorded and in less than a week your 80gig is clogged. So I let the service lapse figuring that I could record the programs manually, if there was ever any over time it always cut it off. Well no, if you do not subscribe that function is turned off and your TiVo unit becomes a boat anchor. No if I decide to get into the DVR market again I will use the Satellite of Cable DVR, same functionality for the same about fee with out having to pay hundreds for a boat anchor."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"Go through your cable company instead if you want a dvr. Tivo has the worst customer service and I don't know about anyone else, but my Tivo was more trouble than it was worth to hook up. I got our new computer up and running 2x's faster than tivo. If you don't have a phone jack close buy you better have a wireless internet router for your home( the network adapter isn't included at $30-$50 a piece) or it won't work, then you better hope there are no problems connecting to it, after 8 hours of phone calls and different hookup configurations I cancelled my subsription and took this piece of krap back to the store."
1,Piompi Kuax,"I thought i could have some basic functions without TIVO subscription, unfortunatelly nothing works unless you purchase a subscription!Hence there is no tangible value if you already have a DVR from your cable or satelite TV provider.I returned this equipment and purchased the ROKU box."
3,Good for Canadian Customers.,"A lot has already been written about this product, so I'll keep my review short. For those of you who are canadian - thanks to our oh-so-wonderful (NOT!) language laws, TIVO cannot be sold or advertised in Canada (thanks, Quebec... you screw us YET AGAIN!) However, it is totally legal to buy this box in the US, bring it to Canada, and there is full service offered in our country. Tens of thousands of Canadians do it... but most of the rest of you mightn't know it's possible. Now you do.There are glitches here and there. Some channels get all weirdly digital/ pixilated, which can be very frustrating. Also, some shows make my tv give off a strange hissing static electricity noise when Tivo - what's that about?Not a perfect product, but seems to be the best out there at the moment. Well done!"
1,Buyer Beware of Rebate,"Nice machine, was easy to set up. We had to hook it up to the phone long, so setup took a long time (plan on it being overnight). Also the remote buttons are really too small for elderly folks to use. All-in-all, I agree with the other reviewers.(...)"
4,TiVo Series2 80-Hour,"TiVo needs to do a better job of explaining that an 80 hour TiVo only records about 40 hours at ""High Quality"" and about 30 at ""Best Quality."" High Quality is noticeably granier than your regular television. Had I known this, I would have bought the larger capacity TiVo so as to record at Best Quality for everything. Other than that, TiVo is spectacular."
1,Cancellation,I cancelled my TIVO service 11 months ago and TIVO continued charging me and now is claiming that they will only reimburse me for up to 3 months. What a ripoff company. BEWARE!
4,Easy to use and practical,"The TiVo is all that it promises to be. It has ""re-organized"" how I watch television by providing information about ALL possible showtimes for programs; among which I can then choose. The only reason I give it 4 starts instead of 5, is the REBATE. It is a long process, and even after submitting all documents and being approved for one, it takes 4-5 weeks MORE to receive the rebate check itself. It also does not have HDMI or component hook-ups. So though the Best Quality recordings (an option on can choose) are still good (through a digital cable box), it cannot record nor provide an HD picture. I hope this ability will come in the future."
3,"If it had worked when I got it, maybe higher.","I had problems with my Tivo right out of the box. A consistent buzzing and crackling sound would come from the tv when the Tivo was connected, and then the picture would freeze sometimes. After a weekend of playing with it, and searching their website, I discovered that this problem is not uncommon, and has been occuring for over a year. They were very good about replacing the unit and shipping a new one (which I have yet to receive), but the process has taken a month. My rating of a 3 is optimistic that this new unit will work."
2,Tivo Feedback,We bought the Tivo for the tuner use only and if you do this without the service you get some pretty annoying nag screens.Cool product but but for our use not really ideal.CheersDanhttp://www.destination360.com/http://www.destination360.com/north-america/us/nevada/las-vegas/las-vegas.php
2,worst. dvr. ever.,"I WOULDNT WISH THE TIVO ON MY WORST ENEMY. A PAIN TO HOOK TO A PHONE. TO INTRICATELY CONNECTED TO YOUR OTHER RESOURCES TO EVEN TRY. I SUGGEST BUYING A DVR FROM YOUR CABLE SUPPLIER. ITS LIKE BREATHING, TIVO IS LIKE DROWING."
2,Worked great for 2 weeks...,"This item worked great but broke down in less than 2 weeks. I turned on the TV and Tivo was stuck at the restart screen. I unplugged Tivo, waited and plugged it back and it got stuck again at the same screen. Checked the support pages on Tivo.com and basically it tells you to do same steps I did and if that doesn't work, you need to call the Customer Support, which I did. The gentleman on the phone told me that it sounded like hard drive problem and I needed to return. And guess what, there is no warranty by Tivo for my Tivo product I purchased on Amazon.com. I'm returning this item today because I don't want to deal with getting this box fixed."
3,"Good concept, but not as simple as `just plug it in'","The concept is very good and makes TV watching a better experience. However, the installation is not nearly as simple as the box and the description will lead you to believe. And if you need to contact TIVO's technical support, be prepared for a very long hold time...very long. And the support personnel are neither knowledgeable nor courteous."
5,Absolutely The best thing ever,I have owned this tivo since march and I have not had 1 problem. The 80 hours is MORE than enough recording time. Everyone in my family uses this and loves it. The difference between tivo and other dvr's is the software. It is so much better. You can schedule recording anywhere where there is internet access and you can transfer shows from your tivo to your laptop or handheld device.
3,outdated now.,"I don't think i need to talk about TiVo service here, what I want to talk about is this DVR machine.good:entry price that is easy on your wallet.does one thing and does it well.bad:only 40Hrs while the newer models are 80hrs. I can only keep a few shows every week cus my family want their space too.this does only ONE thing! that means i also need to buy another dvd player for my home entertainment system.to burn my recorded shows, I need to transfer to a computer then burn it, better to have a dvd burner built in. and I got to take care of the burning for my family too.I Recommend it for:people who don't need dvd burning or dvd players.people who don't need to keep a lot of shows in it.all said and done, this model may be too outdated.I was on TiVo website just now, they are going with the Humax 80Hr 3-in-1, that will simplify your life a lot more.Tip: WhoSave.com can refer you the same one for $50 less. They must have some deal with TiVo."
2,"Great product, but customer support sucks","We are a multi-tivo house, but I'm not sure if we will buy another tivo in the future. Tivo has this new Tivo ToGo feature that should be great, but the rollout of the software is taking forever (multiple months). If you call customer service they cannot even tell you when the new software version will be downloaded to your Tivo, or where you are on the list.Tivo's software is great and I've never had any problems with their hardware, but if someone can come along with better customer service, I'd switch in a heartbeat."
1,Problems with multiple 80-hour TiVos,"I have owned a PHILIPS TiVo for over five years....love it and have never had a problem with it. I decided to give two brand new 80-hour TiVo's as gifts this past Christmas (manufactured by TiVo, not Philips). I ordered them through Amazon.com. BOTH TiVo's developed technical problems within hours of their first use and had to be sent back to TiVo for exchange, and one of the replacement TiVo's developed problems as well. That's THREE bad TiVo's out of four. I'm still waiting for one of the replacements. I am quite concerned because I purchased very expensive lifetime TiVo services for both of these gifts. Of course, the ""lifetime"" service lasts only as long as the life of the TiVo box itself...and at this rate, that life won't be very long. I'm VERY disappointed with these new TiVo's."
4,a wonderful recorder,"This required a learning curve. Setup is somewhat difficult, but the tech people at TIVO helped me thru it. I needed extra cables because I have both satellite and cable and they sent them at no charge. Once you learn all the settings it becomes pretty. It has a mind of its own and tries to be helpful. It will interrupt the program you are watching to tape something else it thinks you will like unless you tell it not to. You can disable this feature in the settings mode. My spouse loves it for its simplicity. She can really program our VCR, but this is much easier. Just set it and forget it!"
1,Do not even think about buying if you don't have a land line,"I have had my TiVO for 3 months and so far it's just been collecting dust next to my TV. I don't have a land line in my apartment, and, although I ran guided set-up elsewhere, it wouldn't work when I plugged it in at my apartment, and would not work with the wireless card I bought from TiVO. Now I have to run guided set-up with a land line AGAIN. I have called TiVO customer services multiple times and each time had the customer service representative treat me like a total idiot. If I hadn't receieved the TiVO as a gift it would've been back at the store 2.5 months ago."
3,"Software functionality good, hardware bad","TiVo still has the best UI when compared to your local cable company's DVRs. It is infinitely easier to use.However, TiVo's UI is very slow. This is probably due to the fact they haven't updated the hardware in the 3 years since the Series 2 came out. I can only assume this is due to extreme cheapness on their part.Also, you cannot currently use the WG111 wireless adapter with it, even though their website recommends it. The clock on your TiVo will start to go out of sync the more you use it.They also haven't had a software update in over 6 months. They need it. On top of the hardware slowness, I can only assume they have rather untalented developers making modifications to the software TiVo uses, because the software itself appears to be part of the problem."
1,This is the hardest thing I have ever tried to set up...,"It took me forever to set this up with my satellite dish only to find out after making two phone calls, and being on the phone for 45 minutes, that this won't work with it!! DON'T get this if you have Dish Network satellite!!!! I was very disappointed as this was a birthday gift for my daughter. By the end of the night, we were all ready to throw this out the window!! If you have any other kind of dish, make sure it works with your system. I have since ordered a DVR through my dish company, and had it installed in less than 5 minutes."
2,Satisfactory but too slow.,"This DVR works ok. But when it is recording, forget about changing channels. It is really really slow and takes like forever to even receive any remote clicks.Broadband feature is nice; but USB doesn't come cheap. Its like [...]."
3,Better than most,"I'm a NYC electrician in commercial and industrial construction. I work with all types of objects, some heavy, sharp, rough. 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, these gloves lasted about 2 months before the fingertips started falling apart. They are much better than the typical inexpensive glove you find, but for the price I hoped they would last longer."
5,Low Down Moment,"The short column is great. It lets me immediately drop my Manfrotto carbon fiber tripod down almost to the ground by spreading out its legs to the maximum for those special moments when I need to get really down low for a close shot of reptiles, animals, flowers, insects, etc. Going through all the time consuming gyrations associated with the supplied standard long column use to mean that I usually I missed the moment entirely, especially when shooting macro. Also, the short column is just long enough to give me all the elevation I really need for pictures requiring a maximum elevation of the tripod."
3,not for beginners,"Her routines are very good but you need to be in shape and this is a fast pace routine. A gift for a friend but is to hard and fast pace for her to enjoy, will take alot of practice if we can stick with it. Other step routines are easier to pick up."
4,Good for begginers,"This workout is really good for people that are begginers with the step. For me, after a month I need something more challenging. But it was definately a good choice, since I haven't make execersice for several years. If your're starting with the step, this is a really workout for you, but if you're familiar with it, you'll get bore after a few weeks."
4,good workout,"Cathe is a great instructor. I felt that her pace was easy enough for beginners, and yet you could ramp it up for advanced. It might have been a bit longer."
5,Gives a great workout,"I really like this workout. It is about 28 minutes of working out, then a cool down that I really like. I use it at least once a week to maintain my weight loss. When my grandson lost my disc on me, I ordered a new one instead of buying a different one, because I really like this one. I rate it 5 stars. A+"
4,Liked this product.,"I wanted a basic step work out and that is what this is. I've followed step for many years, so this was an ideal product for me. It would take a lot of practice for a beginner as she doesn't do a lot of repeat steps during her routine."
1,You really can't read the poetry in the Kindle version,"This book is impossible to read, at least on the Kindle Touch. For example, the first poem (Three Sunsets) should have 19 stanzas and cover 8 pages in the book according to the Table of Contents. On my Kindle Touch I can only get 5 stanzas if I make the text as small as possible. That is what fits on a single page on the Kindle. When you turn the page you get the title of the next poem, The Path of Roses. And it continues this way through the entire book. You get just one page of each poem. I guess it is worth exactly what it costs."
3,Utensil holder.,"I waited a long time to receive this product. While it is pretty, it is smaller than I expected. The color is a little brighter than I expected too. I use it but I am still looking for another one to replace it."
2,Expensive and break easily,"Bought 3 of them for use in my room. Two of them broke after about 1 year just because they are fragile. One of them broke while I was trying to screw them in, the other just broke on its own. Not a very sturdy bulb so you might never get the 10,000 hours. They do give a nice white-sterile light, but I prefer this type of lighting because I read a lot in my room. They start off a bit dim like most CFLs eventually peaking about 4-5 minutes. They are pretty hot after they've been on for a while.I think there are better cheaper alternatives these days so I can't say I recommend this anymore as more full spectrum 5000K bulbs have hit the market."
5,Eyeball Skeleton Rocks !!,"Eyeball Skeleton is pure genious - heavy metal for kids.Fun and enjoyable lyrics, catchy tunes by talented eight year olds.This is a must have for some fun, innocent, imaginative rock and roll (and for a good laugh as well)"
1,This is a boat.,"I came across this on a search for a model kit for our family worship night as a fun project. It is well crafted, but I can't purchase it because it is useless as a teaching aid! It is not Biblically accurate! Noah's ark was shaped like a long box, not a boat. I'm sorry, but I'll risk buying parts at a craft store and engineering it myself."
1,Big Disappointment,"Ad was misleading by the omission of information. Parts were so minuscule they were almost unidentifiable. Very small parts were loose in the box and poorly packaged for mailing. I'll allow for the fact that I am not a model maker and I wanted the item for a children's Sunday School lesson, but I could not tell from their ad that it was a model. Bad news that it cost me nearly twice as much to send it back than it did to receive it. Return policies are in their favor. I will not use this source again.Minicraft Models Noah's Ark Cubit Scale"
1,Expensive and worthless,I purchased this plastic Noah Ark thinking I found the best Model ever when the price is high and the picture is showing a piece of art! But I was disapointed when I opened the box it is colorless plastic boat with microscopic size of animals and Noah and they are asking me to paint it all and to assemble it before.My advice this is a lie dont be attracked by the fake expensive Noah Ark.
4,Great Mockumentary,A very real-feeling mockumentary about the making of a zombie movie. Good acting for such low budget film. Great story line.
1,Bad Product.,"I first bought this product in the body spray and wasn't really pleased with it. I then noticed this however smelled very good. Almost like some kind of Lemon/Lime soda. It smelled so good I just had to buy it. Anyways the next morning I tried it out and it was nothing really special. I have to say Axe shower gels do NOT scrub good at like soap or other bodywashes, and this one is no exception. And even in the shower, especially after, there was pretty much no scent. It's way too light. So overall, don't buy this product. Save your money."
3,Shocked by the ending,Don't want to spoil it for anyone so I won't give it away. I was thinking how are they going to get out of this? I just laughed. They book was OK and you may enjoy it more than I did but great literature this is not. It isn't even a good western.If you want to read a great/good western try The Searchers.Elmore writes some great stuff. This just isn't it.
4,cracker began here.,"I have to say I bought this album becuase I'm a big fan of cracker if you like cracker you will love ths album, if you lik folk and country music you wil like this albumb if you just want to hear something different then the crap thats played on todays radio then you should all love this album it's very interesting though you hav to really listen to it for a few songs beforre you wil reall like ithope this helps happy days to everyone"
5,A Book for All of JAHs I-dren to read,"Neville Garrick should receive praises for dis book. Ihi never see no book that shows de beauty, de glory, and de power of Africa like dis one. I think dat dis book also shows not just dreads but coptic dread, orthodox dread, etc... I hope unu pick up dis book and marvel in its journey. Praise to the most HIGH."
3,Return to Castle Wolfenstein,"This game was actually very good. The envirvoment is very dark, and gives you the feeling of a Nazi-controlled place. The music is also very good done, scary in the ""occult""-events, and action-thriller-like when you're in action. The only fault, or problem, or whatever you would call it, is the undead. They just, well, don't fit. In every game/movie about Nazis fingering with ""mysteries"", there is always undead and the devil, and that kind of stuff. The story really needs to be reworked a little bit, because you already know what's going to happen, what the Nazis are hiding, and who you are going to fight against. It is a really good, maybe short, action game, but the story really needs work, because I think the story/plot of the game is really an important thing, if you are going to create a single player episode."
5,Wolfenstein Kills,Wolfenstein is THE best multiplayer game EVER. The single player is challenging too (provided you don't cheat). ... It's best if you listen to Rammstein while you play.
5,Great multiplayer and decent single player,A solid re-make with great graphics and above-average game-play that played on my computer bug-free without a single crash. Recommended.
2,Too much hype,"Return to Castle Wolfenstein is set in Nazi Germany, capitalyzing on its predecessor that made 3D shooters popular. While playing, however, you will notice that besides Nazis there are no other commonalities between the two.While the single-player game offers some diversity in environments, there are too few missions. ID software did not put as much time into this project as Quake, Quake II, or Alice. The very noticeable differences: very few graphical effects, poor soundtrack, the AI is not intelligent, and the range of enemies limited - only about 7 types encountered"
5,A Great Package for A Great Game,"While this game may have it's shortcomings in single player (even the hardest difficulty provides little challenged for moderately experienced FPS fans), the multiplayer portion RTCW compensates for that. Multiplay is excellent to say the least, and I really feel this game still stands tall against such titles as Quake3 and Unreal Tournament 2003.A nice bonus to this ""game of the year"" edition is that it's packaged with a copy of the original wolfenstein game from the early 90s. It's amazing if for no other reason to visit this oldie simply to see how far the industry's come.Overall, this is a great game with good models and animation, compelling sound and music, and addictive multiplayer action. Definetely worth a shot if you're a fan of the original."
1,I don't Recommend this game............,"I'm a big QUake2,QUake3,Half Life TFC fan and as such they were Jewels but Return to WOlfy...is a Doggie BOne ready to be buried..The maps were way too small..... crampedand not scaled properly.....THe baddy layouts were poor and not balanced....The Objects like health packs, etc were difficult to see....The Alarm map was incredibly irritating....My uninstall of WOlfy didn't work and one of the missionswouldn't end properly..... What a mess.....The bottom line is forget about Wolfy...."
1,NO JOYSTICK SUPPORT!!,"I can't beleive a game would ship with no Joystick/Gamepad support! Turns a 4 star into 1. There are hacks that might work, but when you pay this much for a game you should not have to hack it to get basic functionality. Kind of intresting the original Wolfenstein and Wolfenstein 3d Both had Joystick Support!"
5,Save the Landfill! Save Money! And get better performance,"If your into recycling and don't mind a little work in cleaning and treating. Buythis filter or one like it. Yes, you do have to buy a recharging kit. It is still worth it in the long run! Save the landfill, better performance with more air flow and save a few bucks! With out a lot of hassel and a perfect fitting filter."
1,Doesn't fit 2004 Ford Taurus,"I'd love to give this a glowing review, but I'll never know it's performance since it doesn't fit!! It's not even close in my 2004 Ford Taurus, despite what Amazon's part-finder program says. Bummer."
1,It does not fit,"I received mine, but it does not fit my 03 Explorer EB version at all. I don't know why amazon still says it fits. Very miss-leading."
2,Bottom not flat,"I had to return this pan. The bottom was not flat, and the pan would spin around on my ceramic stove top. Probably got a bad one. Pity. It's also heavy, but that's expected of cast iron."
2,Lodge enamel cast-iron skillet a real disappointment,"My high hopes have been dashed big time by a sticking frypan. The Lodge enamel coated cast iron skillet is just is not what I had hoped it would be. It looks great and starts out pretty good but then suddenly everything is sticking and cooking on. Even with a LOT of oil!!! Don't waste your money or time with it for frying. Very heavy and expensive to return, so now am stuck."
3,Cast-Iron Skillet,I made this purchase because I love cooking with cast-iron and need one with the enanel coating on the outside because I recently purchased a glass top stove. However like some of the other viewer's I agree about the inside coating. I thought the inside was just going to be the regular cast iron. I didn't realize that it had a coating on it. It works pretty good and things don't stick to much so overall I am pleased. But would rather it just be left with no coating or the enamel coating like the dutch oven has.
1,Warranty on battery-3 years -lasted about 4 months,"I purchased this Lenmar LBCQP1700L battery for my Compaq Presario 1700 and installed it 4/20/10. By 11/10 the battery would no longer charge. This battery had a 3 year guarantee. I wrote Amazon because I purchased it from Amazon, not another dealer. I have heard nothing about whether they will honor this warranty."
4,The new Nikon compenduium,"Les textes sont bien écrits : très agréables à lire, pertinents et pleins de remarques liées à utilisation des matériels. Le livre contient de nombreuses photographies des matériels décrits et qui présentent toujours des matériels en très bon état. Des tableaux de caractéristiques techniques des matériels sont rassemblés à la fin du livre."
4,New Nikon Compendium : short review,"Compared to the former 'Nikon Compendium' this book has a lot more pictures and was of course expanded to include all the models up to the date of publishing. I got the impression though that it has not been reviewed very well before going to press : there are quite some editing errors (line breaks in the middle of sentences or words f.ex.) and grammar errors that could have been avoided if the manuscript hadn't been rushed to the printer. I also expected more in depth comments on the lenses and some camera models - the stress has clearly been laid on the digital bodies. Some accessories have been omitted or important details have not been adressed at all (just an example : the fact that early filters had chrome rings and later black rings - a detail, but something worth noting IMO). The book missed a chance to really be THE reference book on all things Nikon. Otherwise, lots of pages and pictures for the money!"
2,A copmpanion of each Nikon owner,"I had read the early ediction, but this new is superb. This is the best companion book for all Nikon owners!!!!"
5,Excellent version,"There are some operas in which the opera lovers look for the best. This is one of those. Opera lovers want an excellent Andrea Chénier, but also a superb Maddalena, to hear and hear again the magnificent La mamma morta. But the role of Gérard is also key in this play. Well, this is, with out doubt, one of the best versions of this opera. Domingo, very young (the recording is from 1976) sounds superb. Renatta Scotto also. Milnes as Gérard as well. This is not an easy-to-find version, I don't understand why, but I was very surprised to find it through Amazon. It's an ADD recording.I Have another version, with Chailly conducting, and Pavarotti, Caballé and Nucci. This is another excellent version. If I had to choose, I would be difficult.I defenetely recommend to download the Callas aria of la mamma morta of 1955. It's unbeatable. Becarful the versions. Not all of the discs have the same quality. I personally have this one: [...]"
5,I love Scotto!,"Do NOT miss this set at this bargain price. Sure Scotto's voice spreads on top, but so what? The beauty of the middle, so extremely expressive and vulnerable, the heart-stopping soft high notes, the supremely intelligent phrasing, the flawless legato... What a magnificent artist. Domingo and Milnes are above their usual high standards, and Levine caresses the beautiful lines spectacularly. The two duets alone are worth the price-- Don't tell me this is operatic trash. Buy this immediately!"
1,"Poorly written, no background","Unless you know a lot about Mormon history, and about the Hoffman bombings, this book can only confuse. It's poorly written, a long recitation of facts and supposed facts. It reads like an attempt to defend the Mormon church, rather than provide any history or narrative. It's unfortunate, because it's certainly a fascinating subject.After reading this, the only thing I wanted to do was re-read A Gathering of Saints, Robert Lindsey's book about the same period."
2,the truth shall make you free,"turley discredits himself and the church by dancing around the main question. I think that question is/should be "" how could this happen in an organization supposedly headed by people who are inspired? How could they use money people sacrifice to donate for their God, (which I always was told was a sacred trust), and spend it for false documents? Why does the church refuse to allow access to the (other) documents it does possess (Taylor revelation, others)? WHY?"
3,"Warm, but shrunk significantly after being washed/dried","There thermals are certainly warm, but they weren't very comfortable and then they shrunk significantly after being washed/dried the first time. When I first tried them on they came down to my ankle, but after washing/drying them they shrunk up to my mid-calf and were much tighter."
3,Pleasing,"Mark Mehaffey is a very affable presenter of an intriguing approach to laying transparent watercolor glazes, using a minimum three-primary color palette. A more detailed demonstration of how to hold and operate the mouth atomizer is missing."
1,"I love Torey Hayden, but not this book.","Took me forever to get into it... actually, I'm not sure I ever did. The middle of it was maybe a little interesting, but otherwise, I was bored. not one of my favorites. Torey Hayden has way better books than this..."
3,What happens after the Illiad Ends,"This story begins where the Illiad finishes with the death of Hector. The author is not near as good as Homer but it still is a very interesting story of the events that lead to the fall of Troy. The death of Achilles and Ajax and the cunning that leads to the Trojan Horse is a must read for all mythology buffs. For the best effect I would recommend that this be read after the Illiad and before the Odyssey. I rate it three stars soley for its readability, you can get spoiled by reading Homer and Smyrnaeus is not on his level but it still is a enjoyable read that is well worth your time."
5,Works Great!!!,"I play this with a cajon, djembe and a full drum kit (move it around). It sounds great. The rubber hitting surface removes any stick sound when played with the kit which I like. Of course, it makes it easy on the hands too. Btw, I have also used it with shakers and chuiqitas. Very versatile percussion that you can use on different musical needs."
1,1/2 Acre Unit works better,"I bought two of the 1/2 acre size and they worked just fine. They zap a bug and that's it. So, I decided to save some money and bought two of the 1/4 acre size (for indoor use in a small space). They zap bugs all right, but then keep buzzing since the bugs are not zapped out of the killing screen. The continuous buzzing is quite annoying, so I am now going to replace them with the 1/2 acre size."
2,came from Amazon busted up,"cant say much about how effective this item is, because like several others it came broken from amazon. looks like a shipment was airdropped out of the back of a plane with a tiny parachute."
2,"Flowtron BK-7 7-Watt, 1/4-Acre Insect Killer","This product arrived broken. I epoxied the thin plastic broken mounting plate, replaced the broken bulb, and separateded the shorting grids. The bug zapper works good now although it is very fragile."
1,"Cheap construction, poor design.","I ordered one of these a few months ago. It arrived with a shattered plastic support plate, and with the bulb detached. The ""replacement"" from Amazon also arrived with a broken support deck. Returned both without being able to plug one in. However, the spiral grid looks like it would clog in no time. I replaced this with a BK-15D that works great! Buy one of their larger models as they have metal support decks and straight ""self cleaning"" grid bars."
1,Didn't work,I bought 2 of these - one for my backyard and 1 for my camper. 1 didn't work AT ALL right out of the box (I even swapped it with a known working bulb). The 2nd lit up but bugs never got zapped. I'm returning both of them.
2,Never stops Buzzing!,"The electric current constantly arcs across a separator on the electrical grid. So, the unit sounds like it is constantly killing insects but is only making noise. It kills some bugs but it appears the arcing noise/light scares the insects away as they are flying towards the light. Not recommended."
2,Why,"I have been reading a lot of reviews, where women keep saying she was talking about them and how much they can relate, but no one is saying how unhealthy living this kind of lifestyle is. Going from man to man, and whoever shows you some attention is not what the African American female should be about, and this book glamourizes African American women going through life disillusioned and just plain stupid over men. That's not the kind of image we should be wanting promoted about us. Don't we get enough badgering from these terrible music videos and how we are portrayed in motion pictures? Daaimah Poole's style of writing was very good, I will admit, because I read this book in one day, but I did not like the subject matter or the main character. There was no resolution in Kayla's character. I know it's REAL, but we don't have to glamourize it."
5,Who needs love to be happy,In this book I think that Kayla really needs to check her self. She had a lot going for her. Then oh my god she met will--I knew that was to good to be true. She finds a man that was fine and spent money oh yeah there was a catch to that. All in all I think this book was the BOMB. When you go looking for love you look right over the one person that is right for you. Samier was the on that she should have been longing for.
3,Frequent Laughs!,"It has been some time since I've read YYL and it was a borrowed copy; however, I distinctly remember cracking up several times during the reading session. Strictly entertaining, I recommended it to friends and plan to buy it to add to my collection."
5,"yes, yes to yo yo.",Of the many books I've read. This is one of the 4 I will gladly re-read. I just related to a young woman who gets drawn in by a man she thinks is the man for her. GREAT READ!!!
4,What Goes Up...,"I seriously DID NOT think I would enjoy this book. I thought it would be your typical AA novel filled with deceit, drama, cheating men -- and some more drama. ""Yo Yo Love"" was way more than that. I laughed till I cried.Kayla S. Johnson is a 20 year old college student at Temple University in Pennsylvania. She is doing her thing for a women her age. She is independent and goes for what she wants. She dates a stream of different guys and they all turn out to be LOSERS with capital L -- That is until she meets Wil. Not only does he have a job and is also doing his thing. He's older -- He seems to definitely have it going on, so Kayla thinks. Wil has a few secrets, and they are NOT pretty... But you'll have to read to find out.This was definitely a good one. two thumbs up for Daaimah S. Poole. I would definatly recommend it to those who love a little dramady in their novels. ;)"
3,Not All That,"I was expecting much more from Ms. Poole's first book. Not to say that is was not written well, the story line just didn't grab me. I knew what was going to happen the whole time, especially as I got to the middle of the book.I can say that the story was realistic, because most females go through a period where they much rather stay with a man that they know is not good for them and just ignore the one that is good for them, I know I did at one point, maybe that is why I knew what was going to happen in Yo Yo Love.I procrastinated over a year whether to purchase this book when I just could of borrowed it from the library."
3,Cool,Typical story of a young woman in college trying to find herself threough every and any man she meets. This book details the silly mistakes woman make when it comes to men and what they think is love.
4,Cool Book,"I read the first couple of pages of this book at a bookstore and was feeling Ms. Poole's flow, so I decided to get it. The author did an excellent job of capturing a slice of the essence of that late teen/early twenty-something hip-hop set. Also felt she did a great job bringing across the pain, frustration, and naivete of the main character, Kayla Johnson, when it came to her dealings with men. Looking forward to watching Ms. Poole's growth as a writer."
4,YO YO LOVE=Kayla,"Boy, did the author pick the right title for this book. Kayla sure did have alot me in and out of her life. She kept picking the wrong guys. In my opinion she was catching feelins way too early for them. I think she was in love with the idea of being loved therefore she would sleep with these guys and think they would love her. BAD CHOICE!I was so glad when this girl finally got it together. The guy that she fell in love has a big secret and I would have never guessed it. I was so shocked! Wil, how could you?!At times, this story moved a little too fast. It could have been slow down a little. Besides that I loved it.I rate it a 4.8 out of 5!Good Job Daamiah S. Poole"
5,One of the strongest seasons!,"I had heard a lot about this series from my sister. Skeptical, I gave season 1 a shot and found it funny enough to keep going. I'm glad I did. Once I had grown to understand the characters better (about mid-way through season 2), I was hooked. Each season has its best moments, but all of them are based in character and situation -- the perfect blend of comedy. This is not a show for everyone, but if you laugh at shows like The Office or Curb Your Enthusiasm, then you will not be sorry for devoting yourself to the adventures of Julian, Ricky, and one of the best characters ever created: Bubbles.Season 4 has Ricky acting as the trailer park supervisor for a time. Of course, things fall apart. But it's always fun to see how! Bubbles as The Green Bastard, drunk Bubbles singing about kitties, Ricky electrocuting himself, and Randy's gut -- there are so many moments it's unbelievable."
5,Great Buy!,"For fans and people who are new to the Boys, this is a great buy!Season 4 is great and just like the last three seaons it's very funny!The movie ads at the start of the DVD are annoying, but you can press menu to skip them. I guess thats a side effect of getting the DVD out to wider markets.My suggestion is to get it!!"
5,"Previews Very Annoying, but TPB's Excellent!","Excellent DVD set and very, very funny.Unfortunately, what makes this set very upsetting is that it forces you to watch two very long unrelated movie previews/ads, prior to getting to the Trailer Park Boys Menu. You CAN NOT skip past them and must watch them every time you put this DVD in your player. Advice: watch it on your personal computer where you can skip the previews. Still worth buying."
2,Not What I Expected,"Its unfortunate that the description of the product doesn't specify that the car is set to ALWAYS drive backwards and the only ""control"" is to push a button to make it move forward. Its also much smaller than what you would think (approximately 4""). This toy is much more complicated than a control that allows for various directions to be selected. My son is constantly frustrated at not being able to figure this out. I don't think this toy is fun for a child, and as an adult I certainly don't find it entertaining. So, I can't imagine any age in between thinking otherwise."
3,Difficult to control,"I bought this car for my 3 year old because it specified easy control, yet he prefers his older brother's multi-buttoned monster truck. The car goes unnoticed on the playground. Although it is cute and small its difficult to get the hang of, even for an adult. Batteries seem to wear out very fast, too."
1,Biggest Xmas disappointment,"Who would sell an r/c toy car that runs backwards continuously? It was a big disappointment for my granddaughter. Tyco's Lighting McQueen was greeted with glee when it was unwrapped, and found its way to the trash with the day's wrapping paper. POS."
1,drives backwards,why don't they state in the description that this car runs backwards? waste of time and a piece of junk. enough said.
2,Tough to make run.,The car is designed to run in reverse. It will only go forward if the button on the control is pressed continuously. It requires a lot of pressure and was difficult for my grandson to operate. It is also pricey for what it does.
4,Provided a great time,"I got this as a gift for my friend's son who is 4, my son is 3 and her daughter is 2- all three of them were in heaven with this toy! I never did figure out how the control worked but they sure didn't care. They were able to play with it as well as us adults making an attempt. The battery door kept popping open on Lightning, I am not sure if he came that way or the kids did it, either way that seemed a bit shotty. We had to actually hide it though, the kids loved it so much!!"
4,Great toy for the price.,"Bought two of these for my son and nephew for X-mas and they both loved them, also they were easy to use for both since they are both 4 years old. Great toy for the price and they will be put to good use by both kids!"
4,Yes a nice Album but no big hits,This is old skool 90's music. but not one song on here was on the radio at the time. so unless you are a fan of (tisha campbell) by all means it worth a listen. i don't have a song i like cause it sound like this album was made just to be made. the time frame this album came out speak for itself.
3,mediocre soul album,A good soul album with no big hits. Tisha Campbell these days works as an actress
1,terrible and untrue about a beautiful lady!,"I checked it out of the library, to see if I desired to buy it, I DON'T. I thought it was not very good at all. Priscilla is a beautifullady, and she had a lot to deal withat a young age. She I feel, is topsand doesn't deserve to be written about insuch a ill fated way."
1,"horrible, in bad taste for this incredible person","I think Priscilla is incredible, a very nice lady, of whichshould be commendedfor all she has accomplished, she has not onlybeen married to a incredible man, and hadhis child, wrote a very good book on her lifewith him, but I don't think its fair to now sayshe's lieing, why now?? Its not anyone'sbusiness, but her own. Why would shelie to him? She loved him!I think its horrible, and I have no intentionof buying this garbage.betcha that! END"
1,Yuck!,"This book bothered me. The descriptive stories of a twenty-four year-old man entertaining and seducing fourteen- and fifteen-year-old girls are really quite sickening (WHERE are their parents!). Another reviewer wrote that one couldn't blame Priscilla for the choices she made. Yeah, one could. If Priscilla is as smart as she seems to be, and as perceptive as described, she had to have known, even in her teens, that none of this was ever going to work out. There were just too many signals that should have made that apparent."
3,Definitely not Priscilla's side,"The book has kept me very interested,more than i have been in a book in a long time. But too much time is spent on weither or not Priscilla was a virgin. And this was questioned again and again throughout the book. Even though the author has lots of people backing some stuff up. I feel the book is negatively directed at Priscilla and her parents. Nothing like the version Priscilla portrays in ""Elvis and Me""."
4,Fair Treatment by Finstad,"Suzanne Finstad did exhaustive research for this book as evidenced in the 16 pages of ""Sources"" listed at the end of her book. I disagree with people who have said the book was malicious or vindictive of Priscilla Presley. Finstad paints the picture of a ""Survivor"" -- a little girl who had alot of fight and drive and ambition in her. Finstad's various attempts to analyze Priscilla's behavior come off as perhaps amateurish, but all in all, they ring true. Priscilla is described as having the intelligence and assertiveness of something like a great white shark, but it is not described as a negative characteristic in her. Her life hasn't always been pretty, but by the time the reader nears the end of the book, you almost come to the belief that Priscilla Presley probably DESERVES every ounce of happiness she now enjoys. Her life has never been easy, despite her wealth and fame."
1,bad,This book is tabloid fodder. Don't read it. It contradicts itself and is terrible all the way around.
1,Don't bother...,"I think before anyone reads this trash it should be noted that several of the 'credible' sources that Ms. Finstad uses to form the basis of her book, were sued by Pricilla Presley for defamation. Priscilla won and was awarded $1.7 million dollars.After I read this book I was so depressed that I scoured the internet looking for information on this author. There was plenty. Ms. Finstad paints Elvis (whom I love) as a completely hoodwinked man desperatly in love while she portrays Priscilla as a conniving ... It is obvious that Ms. Finstad is jealous of Priscilla and I think enough women have come forth over the years to prove that Elvis was not the saint that Ms. Finstad would like for him to be. I was so releived to read that her main source for her allegations against Priscilla got the pants sued off of him."
2,Enough Already,"So what if Priscilla wasn't a virgin when met and/or married Elvis. I feel for a young girl who is expected to be a virgin while her man does whatever he pleases. Mrs. Finstad does not use an impartial veiw in this book, she spews chapter after chapter of venom towards Priscilla and interviews more of Priscilla's enemies rather than friends. It seems more like Currie Grant was playing Svengali, teliing his side to the story while Mrs. Finstad lovingly writed the words without checking facts or even attempting to get the true story"
3,"Not a Biography of Priscilla, but a tabloid style rumor mill","I can understand why Priscilla did not endorse Child Bride, after reading this so called biobraphy. Way too much type was spent on how she lost her virginity. This placed the book in the tabloid catagory. I do want to leave this message with a positive note, I did appreciate the information the author gave on the Wagner side of her family. That has always been hush, hush in the past and it was about time it was brought to light. Respectfully submitted, Benson C. Wagoner"
1,What a let down!,"After reading mostly rave reviews about this book I decided to purchase it.I was greatly let down.The author rambles on and on about ""he said she said"" and spends pages and pages debating on how exactly they met, was Priscilla indeed a virgin, etc.It was not at all what I thought it would be!"
5,"Ms. Presley is ""a piece of cake""! NO RIGHT TO JUDGE OTHERS!","I could not believe what I was reading. And to think Elvis actually thought ""he"" had done ""her"" wrong....In one way I can identify with Ms. P and almost feel a ""little"" sorry for her early childhood and the horrible secret she accidently discovered. BUT, I think she uses her ""past"" as an excuse for her behavior and for the way she treats people. I wish, for her sake, she would stop trying to be ""someone else"" and just be ""herself""; people would then have more respect for her a a person..I can now certainly understand Lisa Marie a little better (who I respect tremendously because she is ""honest"" about who she is)......A must read book for any Elvis fan!"
5,Finally the truth!,"I loved this book. finally someone took the time to dig under the surface. Priscilla comes off as this bewildered, all suffering person. She knew exactly what she was getting in to and what was expected of her. From watching interviews and reading stories Priscilla gave, I always felt deep down that she didn't care for Elvis. This book points to that. Even in the face of her own words, Priscilla denies the obvious. She saw dollar signs, as I felt her parents did, and went after it. I did feel for Priscilla about discovering her real parentage. Can you imagine finding the answers to your questions in the bottom of a trunk? How could her mother do that to her? You read in books that Elvis molded Priscilla to the way she is today. I find that laughable! Her mother taught her to keep secrets, not to talk about nothing. I recommend this book to anybody who wants to know the Priscilla truth. Superb reading!"
4,Quite an exciting Mrs. Jeffries.,"I know that I usually read these books for the characters. Ms. Brightwell does a very good job with making her characters come to life, and each book helps round out each of the amateur sleuths that live at Edmonton Gardens. Usually the mysteries are fun and easy to figure out, but not this one. This story is a bit more complex and the book has lots of twists and turns. The murder of a non-descript flower girl on a London street on a foggy November night shouldn't be that complicated (at least not during these times), but it is. There are lots of rivalries and double-dealings, and it even stumps Mrs. Jeffries until it's almost too late. This is an entertaining series, and I look forward to the next book."
2,Source of comedy,Some other students and I had fun laughing over the absurb things in the book. The book can provide a source of entertainment. It's sad that some girls actually take the stuff in the book seriously.
2,This book is a ripoff.,"This book is a $14.95 disappointment. Davidson coversonly ONE figure, a resin one, and never bothers evento tell us the scale. What you get is numerous colorphotos of the SAME figure, from different angles. Youend up learning about ONE figure, ONE technique, ONEstyle of painting. How much can anyone learn from that?Schiffler has pulled this stunt before. I figure thatit is just a ripoff. Find any of the older books onpainting miniatures. You will be happier"
2,not for acw wargamers,this only shows you how to paint one 54mm figure no dioramas or nothing about miniature wargames for modellers only its a good read
4,Good enough. Although it does not keeps you DRY ALL day like they claim,"If you want this deodorant to work (keep you dry) You MUST use the night version as directed (apply at night). If you use this AM version alone, you will have wet armpits about 4-5 hours post application. I like the fragrance on this one, it is better than other ""prescription"" brands; However, to make the fragrance better (since it may smell weird if you have transpiration) I apply Dove lemon grass over once the medicated deodorant is dry. I have a bette sensitive skin, if you just shave it may irritate your armpit skin a bit. the night version hurts a lot regardless if you just shave or not."
3,this scent is offensive!,"Good product works well, but I can't stand the smell. It's very strong-scented and like baby powder smell, I hate it. I suggest using your own type of a.m. instead of this one. Try like a mitchum they work the same."
4,Good but there's better.,"Overall this product was pretty good, but drysol is much better hands down. I was so desperate that I bought both, and started with this more mild solution that only reduced, but drysol was the only one able to actually eliminate sweating."
1,no,"I bought this this dit not wor for me , only maxim or perspirex don't give up and don't buy any version of any ""sensitive antitranspirant"""
4,Ramekin or custard cups,"Good quality and several color choices. I was hoping for a heavier cup, a little bit more substantial, but these should be fine for baked custards, popovers. Amazon product description does not say they are flame safe to use with a kitchen blow torch for creme brulee but the Emile Henry website ""eludes"" to it. Probably need to use common sense and a true kitchen torch for a smaller controlled flame."
3,English Grammar in Use review,"I had a problem with the first shipment, the book never came to my address. Then I wrote to Amazon Customer service to make another order.The second shipment has been good, the book has arrived after less one month.I will be other book on AMzon.come, that's sure!"
5,Complete Grammar Guide,Straightforward grammar guide with explanations on one page and exercises on the next. Its British English is barely apparent. Well worth it.
3,Disapointing CD ROM,"The ""English Grammar In Use"" by Raymond Murphy is classic, no doubt. But on the other hand, the CD ROM which comes inside the book is a disgrace. It is for Windows, only. Nevertheless, it doesn't allow to enlarge its own screen."
5,A must!,This is the best grammar book available in the market. All English language learners should have one. I definitely recommend.
3,Future is where ???,There's no Future Perfect Continuous section.The perfect Progressives are all mixed in as one.:-(I bought this on word by mouth.CELTA being higher than a TEFL etc but this is not clearenough to use for quick lessons.
3,booklover,"I like the book, but I thought that should be a little more explanatory. I need explanation about what an adverb or an article are....etc. the lessons are direct and start with examples. A excellent way to learn, although not really what I was looking for."
4,Great supplement for ESL course books,"This is a great book for anyone studying English as a foreign language. Most ESL texts tend to skimp on the grammar points. For years we have coordinated and cross referenced all of our course books with the Murphy grammar books. EGUI provides students with additional explanations, quick reference and extensive practice to drive home basic and intermediate grammar points. The self-study guide/diagnostic in the back of the book is also a great tool to detect remedial grammar issues which may need to be reviewed.Executive English Solutions Chile"
4,Recommended,"This is a book well suited to both beginners and intermediate English students. The grammatical topics are well discussed but the exercises do not pose any challenge for the learners, in fact, this is the reason behind my four stars rating. Despite of being sometimes boring, the exhausting exercises of this book will help you to learn the main topics of the English language as regular workouts can help you to be in shape."
4,English Grammar in Use,"A very good explanation of various grammar points. The exercises that go with the explanations helps to reinforce the rules of grammar. An excellent homework resource, not just ESL students, but also for native speakers of English."
3,A good romance,"I didn't read either of the other books in this series but this one came into my hands through a friend. I liked both Brianna and Grayson, and it's a pretty straightforward romance. The third sister storyline is obviously intended as the link to ""Born in Shame"", but it's not as intriguing or mysterious a link as is the one of young Seth in the Quinn brothers trilogy. Those books are even more satisfying, but this was perfectly entertaining."
5,"Book 2 done, on to 3!","Love, love love this book& ready to read the final one! Nora Roberts always takes you there and leaves you ready for more!"
2,2nd Book in this Trilogy,"Out of all the books I've ever read, Grayson Thane is the first leading man that I found most annoying and very unlikeable. He was moody, selfish, immature and spoiled-brat selfish. Brie certainly deserved better than that. At the very end he seemed to be a lot nicer to her and hopefully when they marry he will change for the better. I read Born in Fire and didn't think Maggie was likeable at all in that book, but I did like her in this book. Rogan was always a likeable character. The reason why I kept reading this book was because I wanted to find out the punchline and to know the history/background to be prepared for the 3rd book in this series, Born in Shame. Otherwise I would have quit reading the book because of annoying Grayson. It does make me want to go visit Ireland though!"
3,Best out of the 3 books ...,"I think that this book, was the best out of the three books from this trilogy. I loved the easy reading and that it actually was different from each book. But again, whats with the virgins?"
4,Amazing! Born in ice #2,"This book was amazing. it had me crying, lol and sweating with heat. Brianna the suzy home maker was a wild thing is in this book! Grayson character was great. He showed Brianna great new ways of life treated her like a princess! Great book!!"
2,"So dull, I couldn't finish it...zzzzz","I have read rave reviews about the Born In... trilogy, so I grabbed the first one I could get a hold of, Born in Ice. I slogged through the first six chapters, then skimmed the rest. I found both lead characters just incredibly dull. They were so repressed, every emotion seemed buried under a thick woolen sweater. The heroine spent most of her time cooking and hanging out laundry. The hero wrote things he didn't want anyone else to look at. Even their lovemaking was subdued and furtive, a struggle under the blankets and then quick smooth things down so no one else will notice. I would say they weren't only born in ice, but they stayed that way, too. I ended up skimming the book because these characters, and their tenuous story, just could not interest me; I found it a very realistic portrayal of some very uninteresting people. Rabid Roberts fans will of course not agree, but I didn't care for it."
4,Enjoyable,The characters in this book are lovely and it's a pleasure to hear the Irish in the reader's voice. This is my favorite in the series. I only wish the series was available in an unabridged format.
5,BORN IN ICE,I LOVE NORA ROBERTS BOOKS EASY TO READ EASY TO RELATE TO LOVE THE IRISH OFITI'M NOT GOOD AT WRITING MY FEELING OVER THEYEARS I HAVE READ LOADS OF HER BOOKSNOW I HAVE KINDLE ANDIT IS EASIER TO READ AT MY AGE
4,I loved the homey feel of this book.,"In the first of the trilogy the characters are agitated and brooding, until they fall in love.In this book the characters are real and down to earth. I really enjoyed reading about the Inn and its' different characters that visited. Nora writes wonderfully about a writer in this one (Grayson). The descriptions of Ireland are dreamy. If you read the first and were not too sure about finishing the triolgy, think again. This was a great read."
2,Boring,"I enjoy reading books by Nora Roberts, but somehow, Born In Ice just bored me. Nothing in the story ""capitvated"" or ""grabbed"" me, I found it sooo sloooow and I just could not get into the book."
3,Born In Ice,"Brianna Concannon is a woman who hates conflict. She spent so much of her life trying to keep peace in her family that she just wants a quiet existence. After being left right before her wedding, she now owns a bed and breakfast deciding to cater to the needs of others. Brianna is an artist in her own right being a whiz in the kitchen, and garden, but yet maintains complete control over everything including her emotions.Grayson Thane is a very popular writer inspired with the surrounding town. He decides to make the small inn his temporary residence until his new book is finished. Grayson had a terrible childhood and avoids relationships and commitment on any level. When Grayson and Brianna meet, it is bringing together two damaged lost souls.Grayson and Brianna didn't seem to be a very interesting couple. It was more a meeting of the timid. She is portrayed as a saint image, and he more a little lost boy. It didn't made for very interesting interaction."
2,Ordinary...,"This is the very first book that I have read from Nora Roberts. I found nothing special about this book, even a bit boring. It has put me off Nora Roberts' book for a coupe of years until I picked up Public Secrets. I think Nora's romantic suspense is far enjoyable than her romance."
1,Not worth the effort...,"I really wanted this book to be good. It had the right setting: Ireland. The right pairing: a skillful, self-confident woman and a tormented man, who is a writer (very interesting to me as that's my profession.) It also seemed to have the right author: Nora Roberts. But these three things didn't gel for me. I was bored by the third chapter and ended up skimming the rest of the book. Brianna's character doesn't hold interest, Grayson is just plain annoying (I would have kicked him back out into the rain) and not romantic at all. None of the romantic spark and unique nature of Ireland comes through in this book. When Nora Roberts is on, she's really on. When she's off, you get ""Born in Ice."""
1,Not what i have come to expect from roberts,i hated the heroine. i thought she was insipid and boring and i had not idea why the hero fell in love with her.
5,A blessed event retold 'kid' style.,"The Bible tells this story several times - the meaning all the same. God sent His Son as our Savior and sent him to us in a form which only a rare few could ignore--a baby. Dan again retells the story and sights some very human feelings and thoughts in a way children can relate. The story helps me as an adult realize that the birth and the coming of our King had very human aspects.Dan shows that children play a very important part in helping others...""for you know not when you might be entertaining angels"".He makes the Birth of our King REAL!"
2,"Good for Ipod classic, connection to Ipod intermittent","Works with Ipod classic, 3.5mm phono jack connection works intermittently. It does not appear to sit snuggly in the headphone jack. It will display video, but picture quality depends video compression."
1,does not work with new iPOD classic,just got this - despite being bundled on amazon with the latest 120Gb iPOD classic this will not work with it. Buy a cable with the iPOD connector
4,works great connecting pc audio to my onkyo,"Recently purchased this cable to solve my issue of not getting 7.1 audio from creative audigy 2. Noticed it seems to be for ipod but it works great to enable the side speakers. Cables look and feel good, comparable to say those made by philips (no need for monsters). Not really cheap though but decently priced. The packages can use some improvement, came broken a little but cables are intact."
2,Not for Mac OS X,"When I previewed this series (Laserjet series 3300) in retail stores, I was deeply impressed by just about everything this machine does, including the cost of consumables. The box and documentation indicated that it was Mac compatible. I use an iMac with OS X (10.2.4). It will not print and proper drivers are not yet available. Many web sites, including Apple's, have long discussions of people trying to get this series of printer to work with Macs and having little or no luck. It may be great for Windows machines, but it's trouble for Macs."
4,Couldn't get it to work with LP 3.0,I had to reinstall Label Pro 3.0 to use my old lists and labels. Other wise a great product.
4,Avery Design Pro 5..0 Review,The product works as well as all previous versions that I have used. It's excellent.
2,Not able to load program on computer,I have used Avery Design pro for a few years already and really did like the things it did.However - for some unknown reason the old (free) program I was using quit working. It was not a demo it came on a disc that I got inside of Avery products I purchased some years ago.Long story short....The new program will not install.After many weeks of working with Avery and Microsoft the only explination is - my installer has a problem.Funny thing is - I have loaded other programs and they worked fine.The last possible cure mentioned so far is - DUMP THE SYSTEM completely and reboot. That sounds drastic to me so I will keep trying to repair the problem.Too bad for these delays.I already have a folder full of saved short cuts with Avery. My wife's quilt club needs some of these things done again. Have no way to replace them without going through it with a picture program that does not work very well.FrustratedRichard M.
2,"Great selection, antiquated translations","I considered assigning this book in a high school Advanced Placement Literature class because the selection of plays is a perfect introduction to Greek drama, but I decided against inflicting it on students because most of the plays are translated into very awkward faux-Elizabethan English, making them nearly impenetrable for the uninitiated.Is there no publisher out there who will create an affordable anthology of Greek plays in modern translations?"
3,Excellent choice for school and public libraries,"I work in a small public library which requires me to acquire materials which serve dual purposes. This title has 7 greek plays which give the reader an excellent selection of the best greek dramatists. However, the introduction provides the student with short biographies, overview of the nature of tragedy and comedy, and a history of the greek theater and the play performance. I use this book for those reports on the history of theater too. Good selection for small/medium libraries."
3,Fragile,"Nice looking, functional, easy to hold glasses. We had two of them break in the dishwasher (on 2 seperate ocassions) during normal use in a normal cycle. Never had glasses break in a dishwasher before, though I'm sure it happens. I would not buy them again."
4,Tricked by the picture,"The only bad thing about these shoes is that the picture tricked me. These shoes have a square toe which I think is still equally as cute, but if you have wide feet like me, it doesn't fit. They are extremely cute and if mine had worked out they probably would have been a hit. But thanks to my wide feet I had to send mine back."
4,"Good for the price, but nothing special.","I got this combined with a 190XDB tripod for my video camcorder, and while it works alright, I feel that it could be better. The tilt mechanism works fine. The pan mechanism tends to stick just a little and I can not seem to get it adjusted so that it will move smoothly without jerking at the beginning. I've also had a problem with it wanting to adjust backwards slightly once panned. This is only noticeable on zoomed in shots. The mechanism that changes the camera's side to side tilt has to be tightened down much more than the other adjustments to be steady, and I would prefer that it was just a sold joint that did not adjust.Overall, this is an alright head for video recording. It's worth the money, but it would be more worth the money to get something a little nicer, as I will soon be doing. However, it has never dropped my camera and it is well built, so I feel that it would be a great head for still photography."
5,My Very First Encounter With Luanne Rice - I am NOW a Fan!,"My first experience of Luanne Rice nets a treasure on so many different levels.I picked this volume up at a second hand store - the cover attracted me and I was looking for an ""entertainment only"" read.What I wasn't expecting and was thrilled to find was a discussion of the arts, what is sacred, what is failure and what is success, and how important it is to keep human - actually all being - connections alive.Yes, it is classified as a ""Romance"" but the ""Romance"" is as much about Romancing Life - Romancing a child's heart - as it is a romance between a man or woman.Perhaps its Romance among Men, Women, and the breath of Life itself.This is an excellent example of a ""simple, entertaining read"" being so much more for the willing, open reader.Thank you, Ms. Rice - for bringing me such a delightful gift - exactly the words I needed wrapped up in a lush package of fiction."
1,Beach Girls,"I was very disappointed in this book. There were too many details about things that had nothing to do with the story. It took way to long to get to the point or the story line. This is the first Luanne Rice book I've read, and I'm afraid it will be the last."
3,Memories,"Since the location of the story happens to be the beach where I spent my summers growing up, this book brought back a lot of wonderful memories. The story is sweet, kind of your typical predictable love story, but for me it was a good read because of the memories it stirred up."
3,How can a bond so strong ever end?,"Kind of reminds me of friendship that I thought would never end-how could they when we couldn't even live a day w/o seeing or talking to each other. This is a sweet story of 3 close girl friends who end up going separate ways only to be brought back to each other's lives one way or another. It was pretty deep at times, but shallow at others. I would say to read it and enjoy but not expect it to carry you away. There are other LR books with more depth to them."
3,Readable but not great,"This book was praised as the ""Ya Ya Sisterhood"" for northern girls. However, it reads more like a dime-store romance. If you are into romance novels, you will probably like this. If you don't do romance novels, skip this book."
5,Beach Girl Review,Thought I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Good Job! Ms. Rice. Would highly recommend it to someone else for an enjoyable read.
2,Mindless Drivel for the brain (or maybe the beach),"This is one of the sappiest books I was ever talked in to reading - and the author feels the need to insert the phrase: beach girls"" in almost every other page, in case we are too dumb to figure out the theme or the title.If you need a good beach book about some real adventurous heroinses, get ""Through a Glass Darkly"", ""Outlander"" or ""Forever Amber"" or some of Pauline Gedge's books and Phillippa Grgogory's books ..."
3,Beach Girls,this book was an average book to read on a lazy day. nothing spectacular about it just and esy book
3,Tastes good but not much of a hunger buster,"This bar tastes pretty good. I wish the mint flavor was turned down a bit but otherwise it has a nice light flavor to it. It's a great replacement for your typical candy bar.However, these snack bars aren't very effective as a way to control hunger between meals, at least for me. They have a fair amount of sugar, very little fiber, and a relatively high calorie to mass ratio, all of which conspire to make this a less than ideal snack. If it's practical for you, eating a piece of fruit instead will control hunger much better, since your average apple/pear/etc. has more mass and fiber and will fill you up with fewer calories.On the plus side, these bars pack a pretty good amount of vitamins and minerals and are a much better choice that most of the things you can find in a vending machine."
4,Excellent...but...,"These bars are truly excellent, basically my most favorite snack bar EVER. However, there is one caveat. Like others have said, they are not a great hunger suppressant... unless you have a small appetite.After a couple of days of dieting, my appetite adjusts itself to a lower caloric intake. In that mode, one of these bars sufficiently takes the edge off my hunger between meals. If I am not in a diet mode, I could eat a box of these and still want more.Man, I think I'm going to order more of these things now. So tasty."
2,All the Boats Are Gonna Rise (Ernest Troost),"A disappointment. This record wasn't what I expected, but you pays your money and takes your chances! Interesting, though not what I was looking for."
3,"O'Jays OK, but no K.O.","Some of the cuts on Disc One are what I'd hoped the entire two disc set had. Instead, it feels more of a survey of the band not the absolute Essential. I am no expert on the O'Jays, but definitely felt that Disc Two was album padding. No killer standouts from what I could tell. Plus, while driving around and listening to the radio, I heard some fun tracks not included ('Darling, Darling') So, for $16.50, I expected more. I should have bought one of the many other Greatest Hits type collections for $10."
4,Best Single-Disc O'Jays Collection Yet,"By substituting ""Message In Our Music"", ""Darlin' Darlin' Baby"", and ""Use Ta Be My Girl"" for other tracks included on ""Ultimate O'Jays"" and ""Love Train,"" this ranks as the only O'Jays CD to include all their 1970's R&B; #1's. That includes ""Anthology"", which baffled by leaving off ""Back Stabbers.""I'd give this five stars, but there's room left for a couple more songs, and I have reason to hope that another record company is planning an even heftier disc that would reach into the group's '80's output and even reach back into their little-heard '60's material.Until that dream disc comes out, get this one. Someone finally got it right!"
1,lowered expectation,"The item arrived in good time but it was obviously damaged as the moment I opened the box toner was all over the place. Seeing as the item was tagged as used and it would have cost more to return it than the price of the item, I just tossed it out. I do t think I will be buying from this vendor again."
2,"Not a bad Frisbee, but it sinks like a stone.","While actually being a great Frisbee for the dogs, I rated this very low because despite how it's advertised, this toy sinks right to the bottom of the pool every time. The soft rubber disk throws well, and the raised bone on the top makes it easy for the dogs to pick it up. I was happy with it right out of the box, but as soon as I threw it in the pool, I knew something wasn't right. Regular Frisbees all seem to float to some degree, but this seems to dive right down and stay down. If you want a good Frisbee to play fetch with, this is a great one, but unless your dogs dive down deep, I wouldn't throw it in the water."
5,great !!!!!,"The process was efective, not complicated. I have the product in my hands more quickly than i spect in perfect conditions. I'm very satisfied!!!"
1,And the words of the profits were written on the Amazon walls...,"This is not a review of the series per se, it is a reaction to this DVD package...The region 2 BBC/2 Entertain set of History of Christianity consists of two discs with three episodes per disc. This set produced by Ambrose Video, a company I have never heard of before now, contains six discs with one episode per disc. The larger number of discs in the Ambrose set, something that was totally unnecessary, by the way, given the timings of each episode, makes this region one North American set forty to sixty dollars more expensive than the region 2 disc. Go all region and avoid Ambrose's words of the profits.Good to know that some would rather pay far more for this documentary. And they say consumers are rational. Hah."
4,History of Christianity,"very interesting, I would like to have the subtitle for people who are not used to the accent, I would like also more details how people of the east prefered islam rather than christian."
2,Get the book,"It pains me to disagree with most of the reviewers because I am a big fan of Diarmaid MacCulloch's books, ""Christianity: The First Three Thousand Years"" and ""The Reformation."" The DVD collection is little more than MacCulloch traveling to sites and chatting about what he sees. The videos seem rather low-budget and poorly edited. They are filled with meaningless contemporary scenes depicting people merely sitting or standing on the street with voiceover that has nothing to do with what is being shown. It seems like half of the episodes are taken up with this ""filler"" material. In the end, these videos are excellent narcotics. Staying awake until the end of any of them is a challenge. On the other hand, I strongly recommend MacCulloch's books. They will keep you up all night."
3,Talking head with fascinating message,"To begin with, it is great that an eminent scholar is the host and the creator of a BBC series on the history of Christianity. McCullogh's original and scholarly view on the subject deserves to be available to a massive audience on an entry level.On the other hand, the intelligibility of the series often results in talking head television. The images of the program are very beautiful and absolutely worth watching, but after seeing all dvd's, many of the shots are used over and over again. That is a pity, because this unique program had been even better with a more careful production.If you decide to ignore its creative shortcomings, you will be rewarded with a marvellous introduction to the history (and future) of Christian faith. McCullough visits surprising places and reveals stunning historical aspects of Christianity. After watching this, you'll definitely want to readChristianity: The First Three Thousand Years!"
4,Fascinating!,"I've only seen the first episode, so my comments are based on that. This is a fascinating look at the history of Christianity, not only the history we are familiar with as Western Christians with roots going back to the Catholic church... but also a history of the Church of the East. Diarmaid MacCulloch is an excellent narrator and makes what could be a very dry subject matter instead very interesting. Great footage as well! I really enjoyed it!"
1,It's not worth a penny!,"I could not finish this book--once I got to the Uncle/incest scene, I had to put it down. I do not recommend this book. I should have read the other reviews before I bought this. Lesson learned."
2,short stories are better,"i really enjoyed robins other books, this one fell of the cliff and crashed. i kept waiting for the power of her short stories, what a disapointment."
3,"Good, but not as good as I'd hoped.","I was really excited about this book. I love reading time travel books however, this one was lacking. Charles just wasn't the type of hero that I like to read in a book. Elaine was boring and unimaginative. This is only my second Schone book, so hopefully the next one will be better. I would recommend this book, just don't go rush out to get it."
5,"This is one of the best damn books I have every read. It is a personal favorite, and it sits in a place of honor.","It sits in a place of honor next to Lora Leigh's Forbidden Pleasure. I re-read it evey few months, when I am dying for an intelligently written, well crafted story with lots of hot,tanilyzing erotic immaging.I loved Diana Galdbon's Outlander Series, have read it through Snow and Ashes, three times, but for a stand alone book I would have to rank Robin Schone's Awaken My Love, way ahead just on origionality alone. I really loved it, it has a quality that is difficult to put into words but I think about it when I read other books and wish they had it too."
2,Wish someone had told me ...,"... before I bought the book that this was a reprint of one of her early books that come out in 1995. If someone had mentioned it, I might have saved myself some money."
3,"Unbelievable plot, but strong erotic tension","This was Robin Schone's debut novel. I read it in one sitting, and enjoyed it but it makes absolutely no sense. I liked Charles, the hero, but Elaine was just awful to him, and there was no reason that he would love her. Its a timetravel/ body exchange plot. Elaine from the present, wakes up one day in Morrigan's body in Victorian times. First she's worried that she's gone mad, and then that she is with a man who is not her husband, and then they have amazing sex and the now evil Morrigan returns into another body, back from the 20th century. So it's magic didn't make sense, but it was definitely sensual. I read this book when it first came out and reread it today. I don't think I'll reread it again, but it's worth spending a few hours with..."
3,Not anywhere near as good as Lady's Tutor,"After reading The Lady's Tutor I was anxious to obtain a copy of Awaken, Robin's first novel. While the book was enjoyable, neither the plot nor the eroticism match Lady's Tutor, which is definately a 5 star effort.However, Awaken is still well worth reading and I'm impressed with Robin's growth as a writer from book one to book two. I particularly enjoy the erotic portions of Robin's work. They are appealing without being crude or cutesy.I hope Robin produces many, many more novels of this nature. Live long, and write!"
3,Awaken My Love,I liked this the least of any of Robin Schone's books I have read. It was rather stale. The woman who replaces his wife's body was an unattractive middle ager. She acted like she was afraid of something or someone throughout the book. The wife was just mean and you could have no sympathy for her. The hero was delightful and deserved better than either one of them. Some how you can't just see the two of them living happy every after. There is no love in this story and very little erotica. People read Schone for the sex not a bad plot. It is the only one of her books I will not re-read.
2,Wish it had lived up to her newer books,"I have enjoyed all of Ms. Schone's books. I have found them well written and with a clear and compelling plot line. Unfortunately,Awaken, My Love can not compare with her later works. The senuality level was not nearly as well concieved and I found the characters less than compelling. I look forward to Ms. Scone new books, but not rewritten older ones."
2,Opinions make the world go round ...,"... and never have I experienced this more than with Awaken, My Love. I had read wonderful reviews regarding this book, and as time travels are my favorite, couldn't wait to read it. While I think Robin Schone is a gifted writer, this story just didn't happen for me. Elaine, the heroine is weak, allowing others to bully her; Charles, the hero did absolutely nothing for me, and the old hag is simply annoying. The author doesn't show us what's happening to Morrigan in the twenty-first century, we're briefly told about it later in the book, which I found disappointing. And I must add, one plot line in particular left me disgusted. I knew I was done when I began skimming through large sections of the book just to finish it. Obviously many others enjoyed Awaken, My Love. Unfortunately, I am not one of them. For a really good time-travel read, pick up a copy of Lynn Kurland's A Dance Through Time."
2,Very disappointed!,"I have to agree with the other reviewers who stated that the book did not live up to expectations. The story was 'darker' and more 'realistic' than I expected - not necessarily good things in a romance. Although Elaine's reactions and fears concerning her travel back in time were realistic, they also made for a very boring heroine. Elaine rarely spoke - which was very annoying. And with two small exceptions, she never stood up for herself. Everyone, including Charles, seemed to bully her. And I found it very hard to believe that she was supposed to be thirty nine years old. Her emotional reactions were more those of an inexperienced teenager than a grown woman. And since she never spoke or displayed any kind of personality, the only reason Charles 'loved' her was because she enjoyed sex - no personal relationship at all. I enjoy travel romances very much, but I would not recommend this one - especially at this price!"
2,The characters are too unbelievable for me...,"Although the book was well written, I could not relate to the characters. I thought the heroine, Elaine, to be weak. She let people walk all over her the entire book. She doesn't even speak the first hundred pages. She sits there and does what she is told. And there is no way I believe that Charles would have gone a year without having sex with his wife, for which he has this ""great lust"" for. I was very bored at parts but since I thought her writing was good, I might try another of her book; perhaps The Lady's Tutor."
3,very average read,"I have read all of Robin Schone's novels and novellas and I hate to say it but this book was her worst work. The frank sexuality that is her trade mark is there. But this book still differs from her other novels because the heroine refused to admit her desires for about 2/3 of the book. The story was interesting as always with Robin Schone. However, having read all of her books Ican see a definite improvement in her writing. Her heroin has matured and her heros became more mysterious. I was a bit dissapointed in Robin Schone's debut novel because 1)there was a few, although very explicit, love scenes 2) the theme is some what fantastic 3)the heroine was not so enjoyable"
2,Just not my favorite book,"Awaken, My Love by Robin Schone is a 1995 historical time travel sad book. It doesn't leave the reader happy but almost releived that is over. Elaine finds herself back in late 1800's in someone else body. Instead of being a strong 1990's women she is upset and lost. Lots of evil and sadness - it had potential just wasn't great."
3,Enjoyable but not great,"The ""plain jane"" cover proclaimed it Erotic. The review also proclaimed it Erotic. Guess what? Not! Oh, there is some kinkiness/eroticism but not enough to warrant the cover's billing. (From the cover, I actually felt embarrassed to put it before the clerk, imaging that I was buying some really steamy sex novel!) There is steamier sex in Laurens or the earlier Joy books.) A word to Ms. Schone: talking about the Kama Sutra might have been Erotic back in the 1880's but today it just doesn't cut it.This is an enjoyable read but the reader has too may unanswered questions: why did the switch take place? How did Morrigan come back in another body? Why did Charles have so few questions? Why did the uncle put up with Hattie's mistreatment of Morrigan?"
1,This Book Is Terrible....,"I have read one other book by this author, which I found to be good, so gave this earlier effort of hers a try. I cannot recommend this book. The characters are cardboard, and I could not like even one of them. Time travel / body shifting aside, the plot is convoluted, and the imagery can be hard to grasp. It is as though this book was written by an entirely different person..."
4,Great practice problems!,"This book contains some of the best practice problems I have seen to prepare you for the exam. The solutions to the problems are the only thing that keeps this text from being the best text available for preparing a person for the exam. The solutions use equations or make assumptions without reference to where they came from. In some cases the solutions are not technically correct (i.e. see solutions to problems 8-1 and SEP 10-9). As long as you have other texts or good notes from your courses, this book is great if your looking for tough problems to prepare you."
3,"Plenty of problems, very poor solutions","This manual has a variety of questions on each subject, however the solutions are sometimes confusing. Variables are given, but are not defined. Steps and conversions are skipped. Sometimes answers are actually given as ""The correct answer is (b)"" and thats it, no reason why.I also don't think the manual has been adequately updated to the new breadth and depth format of the PE exam. There are several example that ask you to draw something or write an explaination. The new PE format is multiple choice. I think the CERM (Civil Engineering Reference Manual) is the best bet."
4,Great for the collector,"This book is the definitive collection of all the Playmates since the very begining. For the collector, or even the fan, of all things Playboy this serves as a great guide to all the beautiful women who have graced the pages of the magazine. Not only are the photos stunning, but the short-but-sweet stories of where they are now and what they've been doing since appearing make for enjoyable reading. I've had the pleasure of meeting many of the ladies and getting this book autographed is like getting your yearbook signed...by all beautiful women.One caveat though: if you've got the previous edition (the 40th) you'll find the only change is the addition of the last ten years of Playmates."
3,Be wary of ordering procedures from Amazon,"I think your ordering procedures have dramtically changed for the worse over the last few months. I find it is very easy in reviewing an order from Amazon, to duplicate an order just by reviewing the item, particularly when going back to check on something. This has happened to me twice and I was able to catch it the second time. I realize the buyer has to be paying close attention but this was not the case in the past with amazon. It seems that your ordering procedures make it extremely easy to double order something. I am not happy about these changes."
1,inadequate for free style writing,doesnt have room for free journaling. each entry has a heading and only a few lines to respond. quotes and verses are kind of random
5,Can't go wrong with Leslie!,Great workout for those days when the weather is being uncooperative for my daily walks. Fun to work out with.
4,Walkin' away my blues & pounds,"Hi,I purchased the 'Leslie Sansome - Older Adults Walk & Firm' on August 5, 2012 from Amazon and have used it several times since then. It gets me up and out of my chair and helps me to stay more fit. I have a leg injury that keeps me from doing many weight-bearing exercises but I can do this one for short periods at a time. Hurray for Amazon. You keep me going. Martha Moose, Texas"
2,Not my favorite exercise video,"A lot of people like Leslie Sansone, but I find her workouts just so-so. Her instruction is patronizing and annoying, and I find myself looking for other ways to exercise. Just don't use this video much at all.This particular video seems difficult, without offering much in the way of results. I prefer Richard Simmons ""Sweating to the Oldies"" series for a good exercise vid. If I am going to walk, I just go outside in the fresh air. This isn't for me."
5,70 Year Old MIL Lost 7 Pounds,"My mother-in-law has been using this video for about a month now. The first two weeks she was able to lose 7 pounds by exercising every morning and making sure she didn't eat after seven. She belongs to a senior citizen center and raves about this video to everyone she sees--whom she hasn't already told about it.Update: My MIL is still using this DVD, and has lost seven pounds. She recently had knee surgery and had to stop for about 2 weeks; she was eager to get back to using it as she said she feels a difference in her days and her sleep when she does the exercises in the video on a daily basis."
5,Effictive Gentle Excercise,"Have been using this video for 2 weeks. It is very enjoyable, gentle on the joints and effective. Leslie's presentation is very pleasant and does nothing complicated. So easy to follow."
4,I'm finally moving!,"I am 69 years young and literally have never exercised. It's too hot where I live to walk outdoors and my weight loss program needed revving up. I'm moving in the comfort of my living room now every other day, and actually enjoying the activity. I don't worry about what I'm wearing (or not wearing) and just jump into the shower when I'm done. Thanks to Leslie to getting me motivated."
5,Excellent,"Probably almost everyone can gain strength and stamina using the Leslie Sansone - Older Adults Walk & Firm DVD, I know I am.......and today I am ordering another copy for my sister-in-law who is very overweight but will most likely benefit greatly from this encouragement.This is very well paced. The timings of the warm-up, the aerobic/strength training and the cool-down are each very well done. I personally have, due to an accident, physical limitations, however, I am almost able to keep up with all moves shown, and given time I expect to be able to follow along with all shown on this beautiful, caring, informative Leslie Sansone - Older Adults Walk & Firm production.Someone in an earlier review spoke of ""too much talk"" but I did not find that, rather, it sort of gives the impression of chatting about the moves, which is very good for me--helps me to be more relaxed and at ease....:)"
2,Not quite what I expected,"I bought this for my mother in law thinking it would ease her into exercise by customising for the older adult and perhaps even feature some elderly people. It did not. Though she did say ""just do what you can"" as long as your moving. I really didn't feel the title of the dvd was fitting."
2,Older adults Walk & firm,The quality and colour of the DVD is poor. It is very hard to see. I was very disappointed in the product.
3,"a great story, but...","this is a great story marred by incessant whinging. mr. stiller's priorities seemed to be the number of kilometers acheived per day and making a relationship withstand the strain of time and distance. very little was mentioned about wildlife and sights along the way, even less about the author's personal growth. transcribing your journal is not a literary effort!however, the accomplishment of these two fellows was outstanding!"
4,Too bad.,"I wished they could have finished the trip, but it kind of seemed like they wanted it for the wrong reasons. Don't get me wrong they accomplished quite a feat and I""m not trying to take away from that. It's just that Eric and Tony seemed to grow up rich and be given all the oppurtunites in life, so when presented with severe obstacles they had a hard time dealing with them. It seemed more like an extended vacation rather then an expedition. Maybe, I""m just a little biased after reading Paddle to the Amazon and discovering all they went through. Still, this book isn't as bad as some say, it's good read, and you get a good sense of thier journey, it just could have been better."
1,Yawn... pass on this one,"I struggled through 106 pages before I gave up on it altogether. The book held every potential of a great adventure but sorely lacked in its characters - the whining and vain Stiller coupled with a boorish Tony made for a literary flop. Their trip was doomed from the beginning, the two seemed to be in a state of constant bickering - where was the camaderie? The whole thing begged for credibility and substance. Sorry - just couldn't take it. Save your money and buy Chris Duff's 'Southern Exposure'."
2,Discovering Onomatopeoia,"No, that's not another name for Australia. It's the use of words whose sound suggests the sense. Mr. Stiller employs the technique ad nauseum. Never have I read a paragraph that consists entirely of the letters B (1 time), O (6 times), M (9 times), S (22 times), and H (5 times). You can imagine my suspense, which was only heightened by a paragraph on the next page, as follows: ""Whoooowhhooooouuuuuouuuwhouuuuuuu."" This goes on and on.There is a fascinating story underlying the poor writing style. The technique is bad, as is the failure to provide more insight into the effect of the journey on character development. Ultimately, these issues render the book nearly unreadable."
2,Speed Skin Cover,"I purchased the package ($29.95) because the keyboard cover ($10 alone) is required on all of the computer class keyboards at my college campus, where I have to go to take my tests for an advanced online computer class. The cover moves when typing and should be used only as a memorization tool for students, not for speed or accuracy (which many instructors misuse the product for). The program is very elementary and should be used only for the earliest learners. You can only log one user for the program, so it cannot be used for multiple learners at home. Painting the keys (free) and using Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing ($10) is what I would recommend for anyone learning the keyboard, which is how I taught my three homeschooled teenagers."
4,It helped me quit cheating,"The skin is useful. I could type as much as 40 wpm without it (as a self-taught typist), but was slowing myself down by ""cheating."" The skin forces me to follow the correct patterns, which are more efficient than my old way, and I no longer go back and forth from the copy to to the keyboard to watch my fingers."
4,Nice program!,The cover for the keys is great. My daughter practices often and can't cheat. Nice program.
4,The skin is the best - hide those keys!,I would recommend this program to anyone wanting to increase their typing speed.The games and practice are fun... You are learning to type faster before you even notice it...The skin that lays over the keys is durable and absolutely necessary - and very scary at first for someone like myself that looks at the keys... but that's the point - hide those keys!!!
1,What A Pain In The Butt,"This is truly one of the most frustrating pieces of useless junk I've ever worked with. No wonder HP is in financial trouble. The drivers provided by HP are totally useless. Called up their ""help"" line and got the old ""you gotta pay cause your warranty expired"" runaround. ALL I wanted was the info on where to get some useable drivers. The CD containing those supposed drivers is uninstallable. In XP, the OS keeps looking for a file called"" hpf600.inf. Guess what. No such file exists anywhere. The drivers for the thing are not in the XP driver library either. This thing is far more of a pain in the butt than it's worth. It doesn't even make a good paper weight.Avoid it and HP like the plague."
1,When it works...,"Nothing but problems with this 610. Have purchasedendless printheads at about $36.00 each. Great when it works,which is not very often. Very expensive to keep running.Am replacing the unit after less than two years. Notdependable."
5,Great shades.,"Being ex-military and an outdoors man and putting a lot of miles on the highway in my travels I found these Yellow lenses US Air Force style Aviator Sunglasses to be just what the Ol' Sarge needed. The quality is excellent and easily compare to Ray Bahns. They make Great driving glasses in low visibility situations i.e rain, fog, snow, etc. Adds comfort, less eye strain and safety into the equation. They also make Great shooting glasses, really cuts down on the glare. Plus they look Cool. I would highly recommend this product and also the smoke colored lenses by the same company as I bought 2 pairs of each to have in different vehicles for all driving conditions."
1,Bad,The sunglasses were all bent up and the hooks hurt your ears. It is a great gift for enemies! word
2,They Do Not Fit Right,"The glasses themselves are pretty flat across the front, which is somewhat different than most aviator-style glasses I have owned. It seems like the spring-like metal that goes over the ears was designed for someone who has ears half as large as mine. They dig into the back of my ears and I cannot wear them for prolonged periods of time.I originally bought them to take out shooting with, but I will reserve them strictly for my Walter costume now."
1,Don't buy these glasses.,"These would be fine yellow tint avaiator glasses if they hadn't used vinyl for the lenses. Yes, two reeking vinyl slabs riding on your nose. Washing didn't help. I gave up and threw them away."
2,could use more meat in story,"it was more fluff and lacking in a really good storyit didn't seem believable having sold her apartment in nyc and seemed to havewalked away with little money, apartments in nyc especially in the area she livedwith the view would give you a nicer cushion to livefor a smart women she just seem to make poor decisionsyes, she lost her friend. but they say, don't change anything in your life for a yearso you have time to get a clear headi wanted more from madeline's character"
3,Mad Money,"Taking on a too great load of guilt over the shooting of her friend and co worker, stock trader Madeline Carter pulls up stakes and moves from New York to LA, seeking peace and new start. What she finds is anything but that. Her new home is lovely, and she makes friends quickly with a young woman and her family. However, when she acts on a stock tip from an old flame, it turns out to be a bad move; the stock plummets when the flame disappears and Madeline is a suspect in his disappearance. Solving the case to clear her name brings her the chance for romance and the threat of danger, made more complex by a her new friend running away- or is it an abduction?*** Multi layered and complex, this novel offers comedy, drama, and a rather unusual setting for a romance novel. If you are tired of the same old thing, then this will be what you are looking for. ***"
3,mixed review,"i have to give this one a mixed review. on the one hand, i really enjoy the author's writing style. on the other hand , the plot was very thin, there was a lot of filler and the ending was rather a bit of a whimper. overall a well done nancy drew. it is too bad that the substance wasn't on par with the style."
4,Final Curtain: Saigon,"This book was of special interest to me. The author, Thomas Lee, was a classmate at Union College, Schenectady, NY in 1954/55. We both went through AFROTC and became pilots in the USAF, flying in Vietnam. The book discusses events that took place at the locations where I served a few years before the US Forces left Vietnam. The ""Novel"" aspect that changes it from a historical book and brings in some stories of a nature that don't really apply to the life style of most pilots in the USAF, keep the story line moving. Thank you for making this book available through Amazon."
3,Book missing...,"Borrowed this book from a Friend, book is missing Fidel Castro and The Castro Regime(Raul Castro and Co,Etc.) And How much the Cuban Communist Regime murdered close to 14,000 with the help Of Che Guevara to ""El paredon"".Does mention Lenin,Stalin And How many he murdered, some say as Much or More Than the Holocaust, In his gulags, Genocide which the Left always ignores about their own (Castro,Che,China,Russia,Etc.) I felt the book as deep and long as it was, Was still missing alot of information and selective.Hopefully A Updated version will come out and include above mentioned along with Despots Chavez,Evo,Correa,Oretega,Lula,and the Emerging left in Latin America."
2,Eh...,"In an ongoing search for the perfect case for my new iQue M5, I was very disapointed upon the purchase of this case. It fits in the case just fine, but I feel as though the screen is too vulnerable. The case is a bit cumbersome and doesn't really have any useful slots for anything. The included detachable belt clip is a joke. Right now, I suggest sticking with the Garmin produced ""slide-in"" case because you can fit the M5 in it with its leather screen protector attached for a snugger fit."
4,"Watch is great, band needs work","This watch was exactly what I was looking for for my husband. It has been durable and works well. The band is comfortable to wear but can snag on material and be scratchy to the skin. Would buy this watch again, however, if I needed a replacement."
3,Great as long as it lasts,"I love the watch, it's my second. They both worked great for about 3 years but first the screen begins to fail (not caused by weak battery) then the rubber attachment points break."
5,"Great watch, especially for sports activities.","We enjoy a lot of outdoor activities and I was very happy to finally find a watch with a velcro watch band so that I can just slip it on and off with a pull or push of the velcro. The watch band itself is a type of mesh and even though it gets wet from sweat or getting wet in the rain or water, it dries and you can use it repeatedly. The only problem I've had is that the band starts to wear after a while and the inside of the velcro area turns a lighter shade of blue. Otherwise, the watch itself is great and I've had one for over 3 years and haven't had to replace the battery yet. I'd get another one for backup when this one finally bites the dust. Great price as well."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought this item to try to get rid of the many spiders and centipedes that come into our house. I read the reviews and it appeared that many had claimed to have favorable experiences with this. I however, did not. I have tried the item in several different rooms of the house and have allowed it remain in each location for several weeks, but I have seen no improvement. We still have the same number of critters coming in the house, even in the same room as where the unit is! We have even seen spiders build webs within a foot of the unit!I really just think this item is just a bunch of hype and really has no effect in discouraging critters from coming in the house. I would definitely recommend that you just save your money!"
1,Does Not Work As Advertised,Gave the product ample time to work (directions recommended 24-72 hours for it to take effect) and showed no results. Was using the item for ants and spiders. Used for two weeks before returning.
1,No affect against spiders...,"We have a spider problem since we live in a new construction area. We were insane last year at this time, killing sometimes 7 a day. I bought 2 of these to cover my 3500+ sq ft home. I placed 1 upstairs and 1 down stairs to spread out the coverage. They have been plugged in now for a couple of months and the spiders really don't seem to care. They are comming back just like last year at this time. I actually had one build its web off the corner of the unit itself. Some repelling action that is. One can only guess if the EMP pulse is doing anything at all behind the walls as it claims. Given the facts, one would have to think not. I had such high hopes for these units, but they are just more of the same that don't work as the manufacturer claims..."
3,Flowtron Bugfighter,"I purchased this item about one moth ago. So far, I have not noticed any effect in the number of insects/spiders. However; the literature says once the bugs have been driven out of their hiding places, they should eventually disappear.Stay tuned!It is now January 2011, this pest repeller works great!! We have not seen one spider, ant, centipede or mouse after the first month of purchasing this item. Our house is approximately 2200 sq. ft. and one unit protects the whole area!"
3,My wife still hired Orkin.,"Had one unit that died stopped clicking and flashing its LED. When I called to ask about warranty they asked how I knew it wasn't working. I suspect they wanted me to say I still had bugs. But the blinky LED and the absence of the Slight clicking sound convinced them they should send me another unit. This is the ONLY reason I give them three stars, they actually shipped me a replacement unit. As for functionality... I couldn't say empirically that it works but I think it put an ever so slight dent in the number of bugs in my house, but did nothing to the level of one or two furry critters in the house any given winter. Regardless to say due to the presence of invertebrates and furry vertebrates the wife and I hired Orkin yet still have some bugs but not nearly as many as pre-Orkin."
1,Bogus. Does not work.,"I bought it reading the good reviews and seeing how they were rated ""helpful.""It doesn't work for flies, mosquitos, or ants. I am unfortunate enough to live in an apartment without screens (a different issue - one for the landlords) and have flies, mosquitos, and ants that fly around in my apartment.There is no conscienable way for me to say that this has made one whit of difference. Please save your money!! This is nothing short of BOGUS with a capital B-O-G-U-S."
1,not good,"I used it for around 2-3 weeks, and the roaches are still there. It doesn't seem to work well. Though I don't know if I put it longer, it'd be more effect, I turned it back. I'm planning to another kind of it that my friend used to use, and it works better than this."
2,Another Corman Yawn,"Russian film to which R. Corman contributed (via Editing)a 2&1/2 min. ""MONSTER SCENE"" near the end in order to deprive Saturday Matinee goers(Kids Under 12)in the 60s of QUARTERS. He paid the Artist more for the catchy one sheet(movie poster) than was spent on the rest of the entire production. Sci-Fi at It'S WORST!"
2,hardly battle,"only good i saw so far was the ok cool film continuity of space and not enough footage on the 2 weird retarded lookin corman film inserted at least not stock footage but orig. monstas where unknown somehow and unknown y the fat headless monsta swallowed the v- lookin monsta that looked like it would win but didnt. this should sell for dirt cheap .01$ but doesnt, if havent/but want to see it"
2,Quite mediocre--little storyline; weak artwork; low quality,"Was Disney just trying to make a fast buck? This book is poorly done. The artwork is shoddy, the story jumps from one acecdote to another. It's quite difficult for children to follow.Good enough in a pinch, especially for children familiar with the various adventures of Pooh, but not recommended. There are much better Pooh books out there than this one."
4,this whole tape is really making my son very happy Thank you,I am writting to let others know that they should definiatly pick this one up. It's not like any other
2,Cheap feeling,I bought 2 of these a few years ago. One for me and one for my son. Neither of us cared for em.
5,"Nice, but no tripod","This is a nice telescope, but beware of distributors that sell it for a low price, but don't include what Celestron says is included, like the tripod. The tripod is required to use this telescope and you'll have a hard time finding the tripod if you didn't receive it with this scope. Now I have to return the scope and buy from a distributor that correctly includes it. (sigh.)"
5,I agree. He did it again.,"Yes, he did it again. He simply explains it clearly.Not a serious book for graduate students, but for undergraduates: this book is just in the middle of two levels."
5,Excellent introduction,"An excellent introduction to the subject, just as Richard Feynman lecturing Physics, extremely readable!"
2,Learn the stuff before writing a textbook,"This book may be great for students. I has many good examples, is well written and generally looks good. HOWEVER, for anyone who actually knows optimal control theory it is clear that the book has several flaws. The worst example is the section on transversality conditions in infinite horizon problems. Chiang simply has no idea what he is talking about."
1,worthless,"This ipod nano case is basically useless. I'll just keep it until I can get another one, to protect the ipod's screen. The main problem is that the click wheel cover is warped, so is not snug to the ipod's wheel. This makes it ugly and difficult Save your money."
1,Be warned about the rip stick!,I ordered this for my nephew's birthday and he was able to enjoy it briefly but then the rip stick stripped so you couldn't make the car run with it. Very disappointing.
5,Lasting toy,I originally got this toy for my oldest son. We have had it for years and it has lasted long enough for my youngest son too. They have fun racing with Lightning. Great toy!
2,Worst quality ever,"This car broke on the first day of use. I opened it up to attempt to fix it but the plastic gearing had broken. Also, the decals weren't even fully attached.I give it two stars because it does roll nicely even after the guts are broken and my child still plays with it."
5,Yummy,You just don't know chocolate until you have had flake. Not as sweet as american chocolate and messy to eat (thus the name) but oh so delicious! This package was fresh and wonderful.
2,So so,"Maybe you have to be a guy to get this book. Or have been involved in something ""great."" Long and slow and not very satisfying."
1,Drivers Don't Work With Windows Vista,"I've had this printer for some years! When I used it on my old Dell with Windows XP, it work fine except that the ink dries out too quickly. They cost a fortune to replace. They are impossible to refill, but however, if you take them to Walgreens and have the refill them, then you can save a few dollars. However, if the sponge inside the cartridges are dried out, then refilling them are impossible.Secondly, once I got my new pc with Windows Vista, the printer drivers want install and the pc isn't recognized thru Vista unless you unplug th USB cord or unplug the power cord and then reconnects it. I'm looking for a new printer now. The new drivers from www.lexmark.com, don't solve the problem."
2,Vista users beware!,"The software for this printer does NOT work with Vista. Even when you download the Vista drivers from the website, it still won't work. To top it off, their customer support directed me to install a clean patch for the second attempt at reinstalling this, and the patch corrupted the driver on my DVD drive! That's another thing, their tech support is very bad. They just kept redirecting me to the same steps without really taking the time to assess the problems I detailed in my emails to them. Finally just bought a new printer.P.S. It never could print photos satisfactorily. Everything came out darker, even after the troubleshooting steps were taken."
2,Never again will I never buy a Lexmark,"This was the first Lexmark printer I ever bought...and my last.The setup process takes forever and makes you print a bunch of pages, which is a huge waste of ink! Also, the print quality is really poor and comes out fuzzy with horizontal lines. Not only that, it prints pink instead of black whenever it's low on ink.There are so many things wrong with this printer. I will never in my life buy anything from Lexmark ever again."
2,Lexmark x1185 and MacX 10.3,It will run and print but nearly all of the other features are for WinDoze only.
2,"Works great for scanning, printing has issues.","Have bought 1, and been given 2 of these ""inexpensive"" printers.The scanning of pictures works great.The printer prints fine, but yes it has issues.The ink does go quickly, and the paper does havea problem with the feeder. If you have the patience,just give it some help and it will work fine.On the ink refill issue, I take it to a placethat does it for me. Overall, not a bad deal."
4,"Good product for the money, very economic","The Pros: Low price. A very fine, sharp printing in black, especially if you use a high-quality paper. Seems very reliable. My another Lexmark, the old, good Z11 is almost ten years old and still works like new. Very high quality scans. Decent, yet not fantastic color prints. Haven't tried it as a fax machine yet. Cheaps refills are readily available. Those reviewers who say the cartridges on this Lexmark are non-refillable are dead-wrong. Check AtlanticInkjet or any other major, reputable refill company and you'll find refill kits for 10N0016 and 10N0026 cartridges at only a little more than $1 (one dollar) per refill. I've been using refills for my Lexmark Z11 at all times, without any problems whatsoever.Cons: No drivers for 64-bit operating systems (Shame on you Lexmark! About half of all computers sold at major retailers, now are 64-bit. At least place a visible sign in all those stores next to your printers: ""INCOMPATIBLE WITH MODERN TECHNOLOGY!)."
3,Not good if you have windows xp professional 64-bit,"I have the newest version of windows xp professional 64-bit. I bought this printer recently and it said it was compatible with XP..so I TRIED installing it, and it wouldnt go through! After countless searching on the internet, I had found out this printer wasnt compatible with the 64-bit. It should be because this is the latest version of windows XP! I am disapointed. Right now I am trying to get a different operating system so my printer will install. If not, I will have to face a 15% restocking fee at circuit city. I gave this three stars because I love ths look and the features because it seems to install on regular XP 32-bit/2000/98 computers.Edit: I have called and emailed lexmark and they have said they have no future plans of releasing 64-bit drivers to make this compatible with the system. That is lousy support from Lexmark! I have since then returned the printer and paid an extra $9 for restocking. Not good."
3,Very noisy!!!,"Besides the fact that the ink goes very fast, this product is very noisy. A lot of clinking and clanking when it's turned on, when it gets done printing, and when it's turned off. While it's printing it seems to be at an acceptable noise volume tho. Another thing I'm not happy with is when I print pictures out they tend to have a lot of red tone in them. After I'm done with using the red eye option and print it out it still seems like the eyes and other things have a red hue to them. Next time I'll buy something else, but for now it gets the job done for most projects."
1,worst printer I've ever had,"The print quality is horrible. It didn't matter how many times I tried to clean it, up the quality or ink level, or ""align"" the cartidges. Everything just prints horribly. Hoping that Lexmark just screwed me by giving me terrible ink cartidges when I bought it, I tried buying new cartidges in hopes of salvaging it but that was to no avail. It's going in the trash. I don't feel good enough about this thing to give it away to anyone I know or try to sell in on eBay. That's how bad it is at printing anything. If you want to pay this much for a scanner, go right ahead and buy it. With the terrible print problem, you can't copy anything without it looking jacked up when it comes out. I'm about to go ""Office Space"" on this thing."
2,The Ultimate Guide to Bird Dog Training,"I ordered this book in hopes of receiving an up to date training book. I was somewhat disappointed. The book looks like it is a new updated training book; and even states inside that it contains the authors older material with new updated training methods, but I found it to be only dated marerial. The pictures are from the 70's, and not good ones at that. I do feel like the methods would work for a person training a pointer; I was trying to obtain information in the training of a lab for upland game, and this book was lacking in that reguards. If you are looking for a newer material, you may want to check other sources. I am trying The Labrador Shooting Dog next."
3,ultimate guide to bird dog training,The basics of this book are exellent although sections of book such as callback pens are not applicable to new zealand
1,"rehash of ""hunt close""","this book is a rehash of this guy's book titled ""hunt close"" that he wrote about 30 or 40 years ago. outdated."
4,Great book for beginners!,"This book is not as technical as the Mann book. If you are just starting out as a photographer, I recommend this book! Baker gives good clear descriptions of depth-of-field and aperture, etc. If you are more experienced with cameras, then the book How to Photograph Cars by James Mann is probably the one you want. [...]"
1,Waste of time/money,"The techniques used were pretty old school and not so much for today's digital world. Majority of the pictures inside the book aren't impressive at all. The cover shot seems to be the best one but anyone can take that same picture with the right amount of light. I didn't learn anything I haven't already read online. Books on car photography are extremely limited, but even so I would not recommend reading this book. Read the other one by James Mann instead."
2,A Shift In Hermeneutics Study,Hermeneutical Spiral is a fresh approach to hermeneutics with detailed research and scholarship.
5,It has helped me.,"Other reviewers have described the content of the book better than I but I'd like to add some personal thoughts. First off, I am merely a Christian layman who is always looking to improve my Biblical study methods and with that in mind, this book does a very good job helping me. Hermeneutics sounds intimidating but it is just the theory and methodology of interpetation. In this case, interpretation of Biblical text. This book came highly recommended to me by several Christian scholars and I now realize why it comes so highly recommended. It not only is good as an introduction to Biblical hermeneutics for the layman like me, it is also good for the seminary student as well (in fact this book is used at many Christian seminaries). Don't be intimidated by the title. It is a wonderfully helpful textbook written in an easy-to-understand style and in a manner designed to teach.If you are one who wishes to improve one's Bible studies, this is definitely a book to read as an aid."
3,Dissapointed,I found the content to be basic and not very useful as a resource for text foundational support. Doesn't go deep enough in considering the cultural environment in which the author of text work nor the implied reser when the text was written. I was looking for deep well thought out review and didn't find it.
3,Interesting....,"This is for the people that like gratuitous shots of the female anatomy. I'm not completely into it, but the stories the stars tell make the rest of the DVD worth it."
3,Disappointed...,"It appears that loyal fans will not get the two Mac movies with this final season, which is of course, a huge disappointment. Given there are only 4 discs and 14 episodes that is about 3-4 episodes per disc, not leaving enough room for the 2 movies. Fer shame paramount, fer shame."
3,MacGyver The Complete Final Season.....,"After the mixture of good and bad episodes in season 6, I only bought the final season to complete the set of all 7 boxsets.The final season is pretty good, with the exception of a few episodes, however you can easily tell that the writers were running out of ideas, and hence the short 14 episode season (usually 22 episodes).All in all, worth buying if you're a die hard fan, or want a complete collection.6/10 overall."
3,Final rip off,Much fewer epidsodes with this Final season than the previous seasons yet cost the same. Very disappointed.
4,The missing episodes,"Is it just me, or are there atleast 3 ""missing"" episodes; such as the First Murdoc episode: Dana Elcar, Richard Dean Anderson, Michael deBears, and Bruce McGillis (Taxi cab; Murdoc in drag) and the REUNION episode of that (stuck in a semi, obitiuary to bring them together) Those were the first two encounters with Michael deBears character and we do NOT have them on DVD!The THIRD episode I can confirm is missing is also early, Season 2 I think; Dana Elcar and Richard Dean Anderson head to find his ""wife"" and first time we see the character they bring back the following season who plays Dana Elcar's ""Son""Have any other of you noted the same issues? on episodes I may have missed and or forgotten?Mayby they are planning a ""missing episodes"" package."
3,A disappointing ending to a great show,"Season 7 follows Paramount's straight no frills approach as the other MacGyver box sets so don't expect any bonus features. As you watch the episodes, it will quickly become apparent why the 7th season includes only 14 episodes punctuated by a finale that leaves you nostalgic for the good old Mac. While it was nice to see the familiar faces of Jack Dalton, Dent (Dick Butkus), the Coltons and Murdoc, the episodes don't seem to have the excitement or creativity that was MacGyver's trademark. The best example of this is the Colton episode where Mac only makes brief cameos at the beginning and end of the episode. Overall, you'll enjoy season 7 if you like McGyver, just don't be surprised when the series crawls to an end."
3,Disappointed in season 7,"Why? Bacause it should have the 2 movies included. I have called Paramount Studios in L.A., (long-distance and talked to some lady in a big hurry to get me off the phone.) I have checked the website frequently, no titles yet. I even sent ""snail mail"" to Paramount. Not expecting a reply. There's no such thing as ""customer service"" on the planet anymore. I have to agree with a lot of the reviews, most of the dvd's (season 1-6)that I have do look like someone recorded then from TV land. Terrible sound quality etc, etc."
1,Yuk,"We ordered this DVD because we saw it described in a PBS catalog as having ghost stores with intricate, twisted plots. We're not into the blood and gore, slasher movies, so this seemed like a great alternative. On the positive side, some of the stories did build up the suspense. It was very hard to follow the plots to the stories,though, and there was always a huge letdown at the end. We suffered through all six stories simply because we had paid for the DVD, and we kept hoping the stories would get better. They didn't. Ghost stories don't need to be bloody, but they do need to be spooky. These stories definitely were not.Two ghost stories that do have twisted, intricate plots and are genuinely spooky are The Innocents, starring Deborah Kerr, made in 1961, and The Others, starring Nicole Kidman, made in 2001."
2,Excessive spitting,"I tried this solder for the first time tonight. It frequently spit hot resin, causing several pinhole burns on my hands and leaving hard resin droplets scattered across my circuit board. I've never experienced this much spitting with cheap 60/40 tin/lead solder from Radio Shack. If you try this solder, I strongly recommend wearing safety glasses!I was using the solder with a new Weller soldering station (WES51). It's possible I had the temperature set too high or too low. I will update my review if I find a temperature that reliably reduces the resin spitting."
4,very good,this is a very good idem but next time i will get a 1pound of lead free solder for 3 bucks its a small amount but for startersi recommend it
4,solder on the go!,"product came faster than advertised, if you can believe that! convenient container,you just pull what you need, when you need it.This is a good product if you don't solder that often. If you solder a lot, you might want to get a bigger size, as it depletes rather rapidly.Not much more to say about this item, other than it does as advertised."
4,Good solder,"Sticks well, doesn't bridge and the melting temp is not as high as I expected, which for me is a good thing, however it is a little pricey for solder in my opinion, but generally you get what you pay for."
1,doesnt even melt right,ruined my soldering iron and not solder advertised. it is absolutely horrible. Worst solder ever. DO NOT BUY. . .
3,Reprint leaves its imprint,"The original of this book (I seem to remember) was a little longer, but this version captures enough by way of extract to be most helpful. The true joy of Letters to Street Christians for me is revisiting a time of counterculture, language and traditions that now seem a life away, and yet there is a lot to be said about using creative paraphrases in place of the ancient words of scripture.This translation (paraphrase) is particularly down to earth and gutsy when describing such things as sex, love and the essentials of faith. I recommend this book to anyone who would like a chance to rethink what the original versions have to say... without losing sight of the need for more accurate translations for the serious Bible student.""Letters"" gives us something to live with, even though it is now a little dated."
1,Lesson Learned,"It perfomed great for about the first 8 minutes I have owned it. Now it just declares ""WRONG DISC"" with every DVD I insert. This thing is going in the garbage. Lesson learned."
5,Hysterical!!!!!,This was one of the funniest books I have ever read. Various anecdotes relating to everyday life anyone can appreciate. I found myself literally laughing out loud.
1,Disappointed,I have loved short stories all my life and have no problem accepting stories where the story line doesn't appeal to me as long as the the author has written it well. In this collection there are so many stories I just can't tollerate that I have to give this one a 1 even though I haven't finished reading the book. I intend reading all of the stories. What a task.
2,Be careful from who you buy from.,"My mother loves the show and begged me to get her this season for mothers day. She was thrilled when I gave it to her and she enjoyed it very much until some of the discs started to skip.After emailing the seller, it seems impossible to get a replacement and now Im stuck paying to ship it back to the seller. So be careful who you buy this product from."
2,Poor Product Quality,"I am new to Law and Order, but I really like the series. My problem is with the poor production quality of the DVD sets. The show deserves five stars - the way the DVD sets are produced does not. The episodes are on double sided disks. Can we get any cheaper?In years gone by, DVD collection sets were attractive well put together products. HBO had some of the nicest sets around. Now days, it seems to be all about ""how can we produce this product even cheaper, and make more profit?"". I would gladly pay a few dollars more to get a well produced product. I'm a collector and prefer something of substance."
2,Law and Order - The Third Year (1992-1993 Season),"The discs that did work were amazing! However, the episodes are played on the front and back of the discs and approximately 3 sides of DVDs were duds. Mass production has its downfalls!"
1,Wrong dvd,Unfortunately they sent me the third season of law & order criminal intent instead of just law & order. And the dvd's were all scratched.
5,Quality packaging and transfer,"The third year of Law & Order is justifiably considered one of the best, and this package does the outstanding cast and poignant, riveting plots justice. Viewers of other packages in the series will recognize the familiar menu and opening sequence--easy to use, intuitive and quick to respond to remote commands. Often graphics-heavy DVDs seem glacial, but this layout allows the viewer easy and quick access to our favorite episodes and scenes. The sound quality is particularly noteworthy, and the transfer is solid and reliable. We've spun these discs on our new state-of-the-art DVD player and on our older simple player, and in both cases the discs deliver admirable quality. For Law & Order fans, a satisfying addition to our libraries of reliable program; for neophytes, an excellent place to start."
5,NEW,"My classmates paid $90 for this book used, I bought it for half that and got it new! I hate to read but hey, I had money left!"
4,A Wonderful 'Toon,"One of the best (and most underappreciated) Disney 'toons out there! The world of ""Bonkers"" is a Roger Rabbit-type world, in which humans and cartoons co-exist. In the first few episodes, Bonkers D. Bobcat is ousted from the cartoon industry and ends up working instead for the Hollywood Police Department. The series is chock full of slapstick, clever quips, interesting characters, and of course plenty of anvils dropping from the sky.The show falls a bit after the character Miranda, Bonkers' second partner shows up. The writing quality, as well as the quality of the animation, drops somewhat; also the series loses the fabulous voice of Jim Cummings at that point. But all the pre-Miranda episodes are wonderful; I would give that part of the series 5 stars."
4,Well balanced compilation of causes,Compilation of theses on the cause of the French Revolution ranging from Hobsbawm's neo-Marxist view and Tackett's neo-Liberal stance to the revisionism of Colin Lucas. Numerous different theories that caused the beginning of the end of monarchial rule. Each thesis is presented by a well-renown scholar in the area of the French Revolution who provide their unique view of the cause. A well balanced presentation of the subject used as an in-depth study.
1,The sound is terrible,"I bought this video thinking it would be her live in concert. It was clips of her tour with the worst sound I have ever heard. I don't think I even heard a full song. If you want to hear a really good DVD, buy Fleetwood Mac, The Dance. This is a great video. Very entertaining with awesome sound!"
2,Where's the Quality Control People?,"OK, there's plenty of Alanis here, mostly not performing in concert form. But the sound is terrible throughout most of the recordings and the video is not that much better.In general, considering these are recent events, the audio/video quality seems more in line with the late 60's.I like Alanis, but this is a rip-off."
2,Buy Feast on Scraps instead,"I recently bought this DVD, but was a little dissapointed in it. The concert footage was taken buy different drunk people at nasty clubs and huge stadiums (not very good sound or video quality) BUT one thing i did enjoy about this DVD was the clips from the different TV shows she was on through 95-96 (although those, too, were horrible quality)I recomend only hardcore Alanis fans purchase this DVD, the rest of you, go buy Feast On Scraps......"
1,Horrible DVD,"You would think that in a concert DVD audio quality might be important. It also might be important to HEAR the artist perform in concert. What you get is garbage audio, shabby video, audience singing with crappy audio through one of her songs, crappy video of some of her TV appearances. This DVD is just garbage on all fronts."
2,Very disappointing.,"I actually expected to see and hear Alanis sing the songs. But the performances are all chopped up and what little you hear on this is home-video quality sound. Maybe ok for some, but I expected a professional production and got amateur hour."
1,total disappointment,"if you like Alanis, this dvd will make you nervous. instead of taking one live show and record it with AC-3, they took all the shows and make a big salad of it, there are a lot of ducumentry chapters and when a song start its jump from one performance to another every 10 seconds. thats why the sound changed all the time. dont make the mistake i did and buy this title. you better take the Paris Concert (with alanis) she makes there only 3 songs but its great."
1,Be Wary,"I bought this and I am a big Fan. I thought that this DVD was targeted at a very niche market as it is not one that can be put on and just enjoyed as a CD can. This title requires concentration or it just seems to be a jumble of low quality clips inter-mixed with high quality Concert footage. Overall this DVD runs more like a Quentin Tarantino film than a ""Live"" Concert DVD"
1,Absolutely Horrible,"I must admit that my wife and I only watched the first fifteen minutes of this DVD, before turning it off. We're both fans of Alanis, but we were amazed that she allowed this DVD to be released. It's a waste of money. The sound quality is horrible. We have a relatively large collection of live performance DVD's, and this one is soon heading to a music store that buys used DVD's. I doubt we'll get much for it.I hope that Alanis releases a high quality DVD of one of her performance with no gimmics, no artsy/fartsy [stuff] that detracts from her amazing voice and lyrics."
5,come off it,"Okay, you want to hear the music straight through? Listen to the CD. Sure she sounds brillant live, but this video lets you kinda travel along with her at the early stage of her adult success. Show you what she was doing, I only wish it had more of her talking and showing who she really is. Clips to different shows is a peek into her life. It is an awesome view!!!"
2,BAD Sound!,"Whenever we watch this DVD, we turn the sound all the way down, and listen to the CD. The way the audio goes up and down will make you sick. This DVD just can not stay with one song all the way through. It keeps on switching from one place to another. What a waste. Too bad : ( Skip this one!"
1,"A joke, made by a schizo producer","Very weak production values. It would be nice to hear a full song. Anyone that really likes this DVD must be a hard, hard-core fan. Mine's going on eBay!"
1,worst dvd in my collection thus far...,"This is undoubtedly the worst dvd I have purchased thus far. The audio is absolutely terrible. I love Alanis' music and her style but this is just terrible. How hard can it be to just tape a concert with decent sound and audio quality? Some of the scenes jump around constantly to the point where you can barely watch the screen. Alanis, just have someone tape your concert with high quality sound and some different viewing angles. This should not be so hard."
4,legal,"muito interessante essa mistura de imagens de backstage com cmera amadora, com toque profissional... muito bacana, o início dá até um ""baque"", pois a primeira música comea com som monaural e depois de uns 45 segundos, vem a pancada com som 5.1 !!!!! simplesmente doido"
5,This video RULES!!!,I bought this video as soon as it came out! I watched it through twice in a row. Alanis amazes me in concert she seems to be thinking of nothing eles but what she is singing at that very moment. She is my most favorite singer in the world and she will probably stay my favorite singer for a while.
1,Stinky shoes weren't worth the money,"I bought and received beautiful, STINKY shoes! They smell to the point that the first time I wore them, my date commented that there must be a refinery in the area because of the strong smell. Despite their beautiful looks, they are stinky to the point that they are unwearable. I plan to give them to a charity I don't normally give to, and hopefully a less fortunate person with no sense of smell will like them. Terrible!"
2,Smelly shoes,"Good: The shoes have a good tough, patent leather finish. Price is reasonable.Bad: They have a strong rubber smell. They still smell after a month. The medium size is more like a size D or E. They are big."
1,Happy Feet,"I got these shoes for my son for a school banquet, they are comfortable stylish and attractive. H was pleased with the price and he is happy with the fit. The shipment arrived in record time, and as an added bonus he placed second in the best dressed competition at the banquet."
4,Tux shoes,I have owned my tux for several years but never have boughten any shoes to go with it. My grandson wanted me to be in his wedding so I needed to get some shoes. Ordered these from Amazon and they were good. Fit well and were comfortable from step one.
5,No blisters,These are a good value ... wore them to my wedding without a problem. I decided to break them in a little bit beforehand. Received lots of compliments at the office. Buying instead of renting is the way to go.
3,What's that smell?!,"Shoe looks fine for the price, but it has an almost toxic smell that I cannot get rid of!"
2,Didn't like it,"It was totally different from what I saw online. I returned it, because it was too shiny for my comfort."
3,Size,"I use a regular Size 45. This shoe is the smallest size 45 i have ever had.Maybe a size 45.5 may have been ideal. Great value for money though, putting the sizing issue aside."
1,"Look and feel cheap, not stylish at all","I've bought more than 30 items from Amazon already but this is my first time writing a review, that means I am very disappointed by my purchase.These shoes looks and feel cheap, not stylish at all. The smell wasn't much of an issue for me but the shoes are just made with very cheap material which bends and cracks very easilly. And the price isn't that cheap. Please save yourself some money and skip these shoes."
3,Nice Shoes .. terrible company,Bought these shoes for my son's prom... used size chart supplied and of course they didn't fit they were too big...had to reorder and they charged me for the return shipping... would have been cheaper to buy them locally than online..
2,What a disappointment,"I ordered this book thinking it would be along the line of Valley of Vision: A collection of Puritan Prayers & Devotions by Arthur G. Bennet. It really isn't.The first part of the book deal with the prayers of some of the early reformers and puritans moving forward by centuries. The last portion of the book has very modern prayers that in my opinion are more declarations rather than prayers covering everything from women's liberation to prayers to Mother God. Not exactly what I would refer to as ""Reformed Prayers"".For the price tag, a complete letdown."
1,Not what I expected,"I ordered this book hoping that it would be filled with prayers of reformed church fathers. The sample pages that I looked at on-line led me to believe that was what I was getting. I was disappointed when I received it to find that only about 1/2 the book was what I was anticipated. The other 1/2 was filled with fairly modern prayers some of which are heretical. For example, on p 176 there is a prayer by Kikanza Nuri Robins addressed to ""Mother God."" On page 180 there is a prayer written by Patricia Baxter pleading with God to bring liberation to women, ""Why do so many use your name in vain, holding women in poverty and men in bondage to male authority?"" Whoa."
2,"Good research, but too much fluff and ""chicken-little""","Take out the fluff and chicken-little-the-sky-is-falling nonsense, and the meat of this book would make up a small pamphlet. There are many more informative authors on the subject of personal privacy. ""The Privacy Rights Handbook"" is a much better start."
2,Non-Auth.,"This here is another on what seems to be a long list of non-authorized dvds of the best music group ever, outkast. This one was better than some becuase of the people interviewed, Organized Nosie, outkast's old manager, Atlanta local celeberties, and other people of importance. It also didn't repeat itself, and used different backgrounds and music. It just didn't have actually interviews from Andre & Big Boi liked I had hoped, it also was a little cheap made and cheezy setup, but this dvd did have extras which others didn't, although they weren't good extras they where still something more."
4,Festival Graphics,Many beautiful photoes in this book. I am interested in these recent projects. This book is good reference book for graphic designer.
4,Works well.,"I have dyed my hair for years. My hair is straight, in layers, and on the fine side and I wash it every day. I used this shampoo every day for over 2 weeks and it worked well. I thought it didn't lather as much as some other shampoos that I've tried (however, we do have hard water so that may have been part of the reason). I didn't use any conditioner and it didn't weigh my hair down or leave it limp. It is advertised as having a lower sulfate content, however, you'll see in the fine print on the bottle, that it's considered lower than other Dove shampoos. Who know how that compares to other shampoos of other brands - sulfates are listed as the second ingredient for this shampoo (right after water), just like all of my other shampoos.Overall, it does a nice job with my hair."
2,I want to love this but...,"I decided to switch from a salon brand to the damage therapy shampoo and conditioner from dove. (Previous shampoo was making my hair poof, ugh).The first time I used it, I thought I found a keeper. My hair felt silky smooth and looked shiny. I guess it also made my hair a little limp. But for someone with thick, wavy hair that's not a bad thing.My problem started a month and a half after using this. I couldn't go a full day without my hair feeling grimy and super greasy looking. Yuck! And I can't wash my hair everyday because it dries out my hair and scalp too much...On day 2, I'm afraid to be seen in public lol.(My hairstylist said it's from the wax they use in the conditioner to make your hair look shiny and not add volume. Although, I don't see it listed as an ingredient.)Back to the drawing board :[."
5,an opened cut,"I can't speak to the rest of the recording, but this live recording does contain the extra measures of the chorus' funeral music for Giulietta that are contained in the critical edition of the score. That extra music is not contained in any of the five major studio recordings of the opera (Abbado, Luisi, Muti, Patanè, Runnicles)."
3,A very well performed opera made rediculous by the staging,"The musical performance was very good. Unfortunately, the updating didn't work.The Capulets & Montagues seem to be mafia families. It looks ridiculous when they pull out their pistols and sing 'I dedicate this sword to revenge, or when a sword fight is replaced by standing still with their guns pointed at each other while they sing. This is an excellent example of how not to update an opera."
2,Messy promise,"2 1/2Mugison can evoke the acoustic grandeur of an Iron and Wine or 6 Organs of Admittance, but bogs down most decent but none-too-impressive songwriting with excessive laptop eccentricities, producing apathetic experimentation over potentially moving rustic balladry. When hearing such a carefully calibrated song such as ""Murr Murr"" however, it becomes undeniable that talent here is to be checked into further."
1,They changed the flavor and it is not good.,"I've been ordering cases of Altoids for years now and they have always been great. Apparently they recently changed the styling of the tin (embossed lettering and points at the corners of the gold border) and with it they changed the flavoring and texture of the mints themselves. The mints are in my opinion horrible compared to the old style. I will probably give them away or just toss them they are so bad. The flavor is now so heavy and toothpaste / Winterfresh like it is unbearable. Don't get me wrong, I like Colgate toothpaste and Winterfresh gum just fine, but it's like they decided it was a good idea to cram half a pack of Winterfresh flavor into a single mint. Grose. And to make it worse the rough texture of the mint dissipates quickly and your soon left with basically a hard candy style mint. Will never buy them again unless they change them back to the old style. Very sad indeed."
2,Lacks support for most of it's points,"Although this book is an abridged version of Piper's far larger book, it lacked support for most of the points it made. The book takes a very conservative/traditional viewpoint. Not very insightful."
5,Great Family Game,"This game is fun. My six year old love it, so does his 12 year old friend, and my x-wife. It's the perfect racing game for racing fans and non-racing fans. It's a keeper."
3,Step 1. TURN OFF THE COMMENTARY,"The commentary is embarrasing. Fortunately, you can turn it off in the options section.Step 2. You must not be a graphics hound, parts of the game look like a N64 game. It has very poor texturing in some parts and yet other parts of the game look GREAT! What a mystery.Step 3. You must like racing games that would be considered arcade. You must love power-ups and short cuts.Step 4. If you don't like tough games, you won't like this game. The AI is determined to drive you off the road and also often speed by you and takes the power-up you were meant to have.Step 5. You don't need a memory card, this game has that capability of coarse but also gives you PASSWORDS for progression.Step 6. Since this is like SSX with cars, worse graphics and limited tricks, you'd be better off buying that game instead, unless you have it already."
5,Duane Eddy To Release An All new CD in 2009.,"Joining Duane Eddy on ""Artifacts Of Twang"" are...Brian Setzer, Phil Everly and Griffen House. Have `Twangy` Guitar Will Travel was the first Album released by Duane Eddy. The new Album is the first Album of all new material in 23 years. Update: The Artifacts of Twang"" is on hold for now, but ""Road Trip was released on 6/20/11 and you can buy it here on Amazon."
1,"insipid, badly thought out","what can i say?the person whowrote this book obviously has no idea of what they were talking about.poor arguments that dont make sense, factual errors, conclusions that have obviously been jumped to with a minimum of thought.this book is simply boring, after the first few dully ranting pages."
4,Very good but Depressing,"I was very pleased to see a documentary about the relationship between the Lincolns because there are so many stories and myths surrounding their relationship. I enjoyed the documentary, but because all the trials and tribulations are revealed, I found myself extremely depressed."
5,Abraham and Mary Lincoln: A house divided,"If you love Abraham Lincoln as I do, This is an absolutely excellent video of his accomplishments and life. It is very well done and it holds your attention. Absolutely excellent. Its a must see to appreciate all he did for our country."
4,More People Should Know About This Book,"I picked up the book recently and didn't realise what it was really about. I couldn't put it down - I've told as many people as I can about the book, but I really think that there should be more done to get the book out with the current state of the world.It was eerie reading the book in November 2001. How could Dickey have hit such a perfect note a few years ago? I hope he is proud of his work. It would have been a compelling read at any time - but it is certainly a must now."
1,Disappointed.,My Confederate Kinfolk was extremely hard to read. It took me three trys to read the first three pages. I felt the writer was not writing about her people as the title indicates. I felt the beginning of the novel had nothing to do with the author's kinfolks. I only finally completed the book because I was required to do so; otherwise I would not had. The last three chapters is what I wish I had only read.
2,Super Reader,"A young adult girl's book, basically, with Mary Jane worried about the usual high school girl problems. Can the other hot chick steal her boyfriend, formal dances, etc., etc.The twist is that she now suspects her boyfriend Peter may be Spider-Man, and the hero himself does show up in tights a couple of times.There are actually two of these it seems, and this is the second, presumably the first is how they got to be in the same school in the first place."
1,roswell,"THis game is so boring! You walk around trying to find aliens, that's it. The objects and doors are really hard to see so you get stuck in area's really easy. I still haven't found one alien yet. I'll be selling this game soon."
5,Excellent reference,"Beautifully presented, with 500 timeless ideas and references. If you are a potter and looking for inspiration - this book is a gold mine."
3,Dissapointment,Since I was very found from the book 500 bowls .I ordered 500 cups and I was very anxious to receive it ) and unfourtantly the book was a dissapointment because it had more of the same in most of the pages. Most of the book (more than half of the book) is about different examples of some type of reduction and most ceramics have only an electric klin. On the other hand there are 500 hundred pictures so you can find a few inspartaional pages.Hope my reveiw was helpful.
4,Beautiful Book,"This book has stunning photos and no shortage of cup inspiration. There is very little detail about how each cup was actually made in terms of process, but they do give brief firing descriptions and sometimes a hint at the glaze or oxide/stain used. A great resource for every potter to have in their library."
4,A formidable tour of the art of ceramic cup-making,"Anyone who thinks there is very little difference between one cup and another would have that notion blown away by simply flipping open any page of this book. When the teacher of a local community college pottery course saw this book, she asked everyone in her classes to refer to it before beginning to design their next cup projects. It opened their minds to some of the infinite possibilities available to practitioners of the potter's craft."
3,reasonable,"compared to daniel barenboim's slow languorous rendition of these pieces, rubinstein seems to go about it in an almost mechanical way. Too dry and fast in my opinion."
3,TOYS,"Credit to the authors for listing all the Transformers. I was hoping that the book would contain detailed pictures and perhaps some backdrop, biography or other interesting information. The only information is what season the particular Transformer first appeared in and what size it is. I say ""size"" because the pictures are all pictures of the TOYS made in the USA. No artwork. Again, credit to the authors for their thoroughness, but I was hoping for a little more."
2,Flicker-Free?: I don't think so ...,"My NEC FE991SB-BK 19"" CRT Monitor right out of the box had two very visible horizontal gray lines that I have not been able to get rid of. After a year and half it has begun to flicker and distort severely.I hate it and regret buying it. I will think twice about buying NEC again..."
2,Worked great for a year,This was a wonderfull monitor till it's display went dead a little over a year after only moderate use. I'm extremely disappointed with NEC's quality on this one. Expected better from a traditionally quality company.
2,Mine's flickering now too.,"Well, just thought I would add my name to the list. I've had mine just over three years now and I'm getting the flickering that I've seen mentioned in other user reviews. The screen will also change size on it's own (shrink and expand).Just my luck this started happening right after the warranty ran out. I'm a bit surprised. I've had other monitors in excess of 8 years that are still going strong so I'm disappointed that this thing is on the fritz already.Really nice while it lasted but the NEC brand is now tainted for me."
4,Overall a good buy,"I can't believe my monitor got here so fast with free shipping. I was really stunned when I saw that it had arrived so early, when I was expecting it weeks later. Great Job amazon! About the monitor, I'm quite pleased with the image quality, games have never looked better for me. I wouldn't recommened this monitor if your not into graphics or playing pc games as reading text on it can be straining on the eyes. I can't wait to see what Half-Life 2 will look like on this monitor!"
2,"Looks nice, but...","My monitor is now a year old. The color is fantastic, the SuperBrite function is great for gaming. But the monitor is starting to fail at just one year of age. I notice there is another reviewer with the same ""screen-blink"" issue after about a year. The 3-year warranty might sound nice, until you read the fine print where you have to pay to ship the monitor to NEC--Mitsubishi, and pay for the return shipping. That is a lot of money for shipping on a monitor that might only last another year."
1,Are you kidding!!!!!!,"This is the perfect monitor for you if you like to spend $300 bucks on another 19"" monitor after two years. I am amazed to read that I am not the only with the flickering problem and the white horizontal line. I wonder if the other people with the same problem fix it like I do. By slapping it hard on the side until the white line goes away. They say you get what you pay for. But I didn't know that $300 bucks would get me this piece of $#!+ Other than that it is a perfectly fine looking monitor. [...]"
2,Very Disappointing,"I'm shocked to read all the reviews complaining of the flicker problem. I absolutely loved this monitor until, after 15 months or so, I started getting awfull flickering/distortion. I guess I understand why the warranty ends after one year. I will not buy another NEC monitor."
4,Good fun for non-gamer race fan,"I do not normally play video games, but as a dirt track racing fan I thought it might be fun to play a game about Dirt Late Models. This game did not disappoint. It is challenging, but not too difficult to just sit down and start playing. I'm still in a pro-stock and can't wait to graduate up to a Late Model. The only problem I have had is that every once in a while it does freeze up, but that probably has to do more with my PC than the game itself. It would also be cool if it came with a little bit more instruction concerning how all the different setup options can be used to make your car faster."
3,It is what it is,"This is an interesting book, but goes on and on forever, usually with no reason for it.A third of this book is interesting and explanative for those who are interested in learning about the great outdoors.Another third is the author being a blowhard.The final third is the author trying to sell you more camping gear than you will ever need, usually after telling you you don't need it then telling you you shouldn't be without it.I would recommend it, but only to certain people, more of a historic read to see what was being said and sold to the masses a hundred years ago. And only to those who have a tolerence for long slow books, because in places it seems to go on forever.If you can't stand long books, stay away from it unless you can read it for a while, then mark your place, go read another book and come back to it later for a while (this is what I have done)."
1,Terrible Quality,"I have a number of Emile Henry Products we received as wedding gifts, they are nice to eat out of that is until they crack - almost every piece we have had has cracked. Terrible quality, I don't know where they get their good name from. I would absolutely NOT recommend this brand."
5,Great Value,Great value for the price...and I ordered the color one so I saved on shipping...and the best thing was I didn't have to drive to the store. It was a big savings overall
2,Good Quality But Runs out of Ink Too Fast,"This Lexmark black ink cartridge does a nice job making clear, clear prints. It's a good quality cartridge. The big problem is it runs out of ink way too soon. I barely go through a little over a ream of paper and already had to replace it. I guess that is how they get money out of your pocket as you don't have much of a choice in cartridges if you own a Lexmark printer."
1,Poor Quality,"Would not align after several attempts and made smeary print copies. Price was good, but did not work for me."
4,Great product & price,I was a bit unsure if I wanted to try these cartridges out but I am glad that I did. What a GREAT cost saver and we have not had an issue with them at all. They arrived quickly and were in perfect condition. We will purchase these again in the future!
4,Very Good Sauce,"This Steak Sauce from Dublin Has Tangy Flavor. Sauce is Nice and Thick. Bottle is a Little Bit Small I feel for the Price, but Will Buy Again."
3,Not BPA free,"Just like the other review, this is not BPA free. I ordered the one that is to replace this one."
3,Medium? Seems a bit small,"Thought the cotton balls themselves would be bigger. But honestly, the quality of the material is so good I can't say I'm unhappy. I use them for so many things, from eye make up blending or removal to cleaning the dogs' (all three!) ears."
2,Not so good,"The cotton balls are very small, you need about three of them to get one normal size ball. They also are not as soft as I expected. But I guess it's what you had paid for."
2,Small balls,These cotton balls are too small. You have to squeeze three together to get a regular-sized ball. I would not recommend these.
4,Brass at its Best Ever.,"A few years ago, I couldn't get enough of the Canadian Brass music. They were a delight to watch and to hear. They put so much spirit and talent into each performance, it was a wonder to behold. In this collection, there is a stirring Sousa grouping, Carnival of Venice, Pachelbel: Canon, and The Flight of the Bumblebees. It's a fantastic selection; they've recorded jazz and silly songs. For an obvious reason, the brass section is my favorite in any band or orchestra; two of my sons played the same trombone several years apart in the Pulaski school bands. Although Jeff, the flutist, was concertmaster his last year, I loved the way Zach and Justin mastered the trombone. Kenny's specialty was the trumpet (as was Chuck Southcott's), which shines through the brass section and is usually the star instrument.These talented performers use comedy and fun to overshaow their fantastic performances. Hear them just once, and you will be hooked."
1,Could have been great . . .,"I'll keep this real short. The pieces are nice, the engine is expert strength or just short (1600-1700). BUT there is no way to play BLACK ?!? This makes it useless as a chess game for those who care about chess, and it's already useless for those who don't. You don't see this inability to play black show up in any review or anything, and this is very important to know! I think most people reviewing this game know nothing about chess. (you can control blacks pieces, but only from the white side of the board.)"
1,"Don't be fooled by the ""Kasparov"" name","I naively bought this based on the ""Kasparov"" title. There are only a couple of workable boards you can use (the more colorful ones have pieces that are undecipherable). I'm not sure about the strength, but I have to put the game on the highest ""champion"" level just to keep it from making stupid mistakes. At that point, it's still not overwhelmingly strong in play. And the game takes forever to think each move; if it's not using brute force to work out its moves, it might as well. More informational than a real chess game, it's not strong enough for devoted players and not user-friendly enough for anyone else. Don't buy it!"
4,"Never had these before, can't wait to order more","As a lifelong Southerner I've never seen or heard of Irish Potatoes; I was introduced to them by my husband, who is from New England, and ordered these for him as a surprise gift. These are awesome! If you don't like cinnamon or coconut you should skip these (unless you're the adventurous sort, who likes to push the envelope, and live dangerously - or something.) I will be ordering more, but as they are very sweet and were all eaten within a day I'm going to force myself to wait before I do. Maybe... they're really tasty."
3,Greek language delights,"For those, like myself, familiar with ancient, medieval and modern Greek languages (still essentially ONE language, even though the author debates changes in pronunciation) the current Oxford Grammar of Classical Greek provides a solid foundation and a delight to explore the rules and gems of this unique tongue, that is as admirable as other monuments in Hellenic art and literature. Hopefully this volume will be shared by many others. One can spend a lifetime without ever seeing the ocean - or learnig Greek! - but that would be admittedly regretful."
3,"Good book so far, but","it does not contain an answer key to the problems. Morwood sets an nice steady course for the beginning student, but when you want to check your answers to the questions he has at the end of each section, you are left hanging out to dry. That is a sin for any author!"
5,Best Reference Grammar for most students,"I always wondered why no one had ever produced a Greek Primer to rival Kennedy's Latin Primer: well-laid out;precise and complete. At last they have! This is the first Grammar produced in almost a 100 years and does not dissapoint. the paradigms are well laid out,the finer points of Greek Grammar are demistyfied, and the sections well organized and easy to follow. There are tables of the most common irregular verbs.There is a brief English Greek, Greek English vocablary, and some exercises, useful, but you should not buy this Grammar for these added features, you should buy it because it is the best intermediate reference grammar available"
3,"Sorry, weaker than expected","Having thoroughly enjoyed the two previous Cockeys I was a bit disappointed in the latest offering. This is not a bad book in the genre but given the strength of the first two in the series, I felt that this one needed a bit of tightening. The jazz ambience worked well and Pete the hapless husband also struck the right note but I found that both Lucy, the dupe, and the poison dwarf failed to engage. Overall a slight sense that the same book but 50 pages shorter may have made more of an impact. That said, this remains a series to watch and fingers crossed for the next one..."
4,Introduction to Series,"I read this book as an introduction to this series. I found it a fun read and would probably be interested in reading more of them. The only problem I had with the storyline was the very often repeated, detailed descriptions of the hero's apparently extremely sexy ex-wife. I felt this could have been mentioned a little less often without in any way affecting the storyline. Altogether an enjoyable book."
4,"a pleasant ""disposable"" mystery","Like the 2 previous ""Hearse"" books, this is a pleasant ""disposable mystery"" -- a fun read, but 2 days later, you will have forgotten most of the details. I don't find the protagonist particularly interesting, but marvel at his ability to acquire (however temporarily) beautiful women..."
4,Cockey Scores Again,"Hearse Case Scenario is as good-humored and amusing as its predecessors. It does, however, drag a bit; hence the four stars instead of five. Otherwise, Hitchcock Sewell's latest outing is entertaining and filled, as always, with well-drawn, viable characters. Particularly good are Pete Munger, the former lawyer turned private eye; weary and bewildered and angry; and Lee Cromwell, the Ida Lupino lookalike who sings like a noir dream and (kudos to author Cockey) is sexy and appealing at the age of forty-seven. The book has the usual generous serving of gentle humor and a plot that is so complex that it's all but impossible to forecast the ending. Points also to the author for not feeling compelled to subject the reader to endless graphic sexual scenes. This is a worthy addition to what is turning out to be a delightful series."
3,"Quake game good,this book bad!","This book was horrible there is no trouble-shooting page any where in the book!I found this to be a waste of money,they dont even go into detail! They must think that we know everything. Its just do this do that, their is no fun in this book,just plain out garbage!"
2,Not worth it!,This set was very difficult for my second grader to string on her own. The string is not durable and broke after wearing only one time.
5,Very happy with this rug,"This rug looks exactly like it looked on my screen when I ordered it, and has a great feel. It looks great in my bathroom and we're very happy with it. We're also happy with the sellers. Because the rug ended up being out of stock, the company called me right away to let me know and to ask me if I wanted to wait for the order to come in, or if I'd like my money back. Very professional. I waited for the order. I had ordered this rug from another company on the internet first, with a less expensive price, but a terrible company whom I ended up canceling the order with. That particular company kept me hanging for weeks without telling me how my order was doing. So I came to Amazon and this company, where I should have just purchased it in the first place and I'm very happy. I'll be looking for other sizes,to go with this one."
3,It's not Let Us Prey,This is not a page turner but the author does an excellent job of telling the story of one woman's vengeance. He brings it all together at the end but during the book I kept waiting for things to move ahead at a faster pace. This is not a book for everyone but if you like the author you will enjoy his latest offering.
1,Not a good movie.,This movie says it was years in the making but in my opinion it is bad and I do have a few other longboard movies to compare it to.
3,Get the Living Stereo versions instead,"There is no need to get this CD when one can now buy the Living Stereo reissues. This same version of the Brahms Violin Concerto is coupled with a glorious recording of the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto, while the Bethoven Violin Concerto is paired on a separate CD with the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto. The other nice thing about the Living Stereo CDs is the Reiner/Chicago recordings (Brahms and Tchaikovsky) are kept together, as are the Munch/Boston recordings. This makes for two altogether more consistent releases. Don't take me wrong, the music on this CD is timeless, but there is no reason to pay $15 for two concertos, when you can get four for just over $20."
3,Not incredibly sharp,"In fact, out of the box, this knife is downright dull. It might work well for raw fish or tofu, but you'll have to saw with it to cut a slice of onion or most anything else. According to another reviewer, it can be sharpened well, but a dull knife advertised as ""incredibly sharp"" only gets 3 stars from me."
1,Dated and uninformative,"This book will not be useful to most readers. Staley touts shorting-hedge-fund managers and similar folk who can hire investigators and who can delegate maniacally-intensive accounting & financials research. This book also suffers from being highly specific in detailing financial irregularities of companies forgotten in light of the stupendous failures of Worldcom, Enron etc. Finally, if you actually want to short securities, don't expect this book to help you."
2,"disappointing,it is not helpful for short selling at all.",This book is'nt introductuction and rationale to the technical approach.
1,Weak from technical perspective,"The author approaches the subject with a HEAVY emphasis on the psychology of short selling and the psychology of the markets. The book is marketed as ""a timely and comprehensive reference that arms you with the necessary tools to make a prepared and confident entrance onto the short selling playing field"".For a book marketed as a ""comprehensive reference"" and priced as a reference tool, this book contains very few helpful techniques for sophisticated investors.After initially reading this book, I have not once returned to a single page for reference or advice, unlike high quality finacial reference books like Martin Pring's Technical Analysis Explained or Scott Fullman's Options A Personal Seminar.If you are interested in a general, non-technical review of short selling this book is fine. If you are looking for a in-depth reference source to be used for years to come, this will be disappointment."
1,Book says nothing at all,"This book, I believe, was written by the author to cash in on the fact that there are no books on short selling. Read about 15 investment books in the last few months. Some good, some not worth the money -- but this was the book that made me feel like being totally suckered. Gives some examples of companies that went bust, and about crashes. But does not even come close to suggesting any strategies or things to look for when deciding whether to short. Instead just says things like: high valuation alone is not enough to short, don't forget to read the SEC filings etc. Duh! No ideas at all. What a scam."
5,The Best Political Science Book I've Ever Read,"I first encountered this book in a course I took at Gettysburg College, taught by the best teacher I have ever had -- Christine Sylvester. It is a huge book -- and to be honest I really sped through it. But it is absorbing and mind-opening. Published at the dawn of the Reagan era, it can offer an alternative view to the predominant tone of self-congratulations that spews forth from conservative hacks."
1,Fact or Fiction?,"The only drawback about this book is that it purports to place history in a realistic framework. Some of the material is factual, while other material is heresay or complete rumor. I would strongly caution a reader to look at all of the facts presented here with skepticism (and check them against historical record).Also, anyone who buys and reads this book should be aware that they are not getting an unbiased view of history and third world development."
4,Some terrific photos,I thought the cover was a bit off-putting but inside I especially enjoyed the step-by-step photos to explain the various steps of wrapping each present. Very helpful. Will turn to it often when trying to make my gifts look pretty.
5,THIS TAPE IS THE BOMBBBBBBBBBBBBB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,Man when I first watched this tape I was taken by surprise by the way janet had made such a startling performance.Her acting skills were just as beautiful as her brother Michael in his Moonwalker which I own also.Also the choreography was just beautiful(especially in the Rhythm Nation which was very intricate).But my favorite part was Project 1814 which the behind- the-scenes making of it.It was really good to see how dedicated her dancers were especially the beautiful Tina Landon and her other dancer I forgot her name at the moment but I think it's Shawn.As I said it is a good video.
4,More Austin than San Antonio,"Excellent book, very descriptive but there are more Austin trails than SA trails. Some of the trails in this book have become our faves and we would never have found them without the book."
5,60 Hikes within 60 Miles,"Excellent book, easy to read, with locations and directions. Order like new condition, received in new condition."
4,Paging Glorianna O'Toole...,"An enjoyable read, a bit reminiscent of Lloyd Biggle Jr.'s ""The Tunesmith,"" but with a more ambiguous and perhaps realistic ending, and with the added characterization and details possible with a novel. The scary part for me, as an out of work programmer, is Spinrad's prescience from the mid-1980s--2002 is looking a lot like the world of _Little Heroes_. Pass the kibble, will ya?"
1,A Horrible book!,"The author can not explain the molecular aspects of biological processes well. The figures were fine but there are so many books that are far better than this. The author seriously needs to take some writing classes. I had to use another book in conjunction with this one, inorder to make sure I got the concepts correct. Compared to the other book, Eckert Animal Physiology is nothing!"
5,"Excellent book for counselors, researchers, & administrators","Utilizing the services of CORE (Center for Outcomes, Research and Education) and others, the book identifies the nature of chaplaincy encounters, describes and documents the unique and valuable contributions of chaplaincy to health care institutions, patients, families and their staff.The book raises consciousness of the value of the chaplaincy services and serves a guide to facilitate data driven conversation and decisions.The book also serves as a guide to healthcare administrators to establish, maintain and integrate clinical chaplaincy/spiritual care services in the interdisciplinary health care continuum."
5,A Great Study,It is one of the studies we as chaplains can replicate and use in our institutions. The authors have done a remarkable job by providing us the tools and data analysis which can be utilized in our institution. JCAHO always looks for data. This study provides the data and the analysis. Great job! We would like to see more. Sounds like this was the first national study conducted by chaplains! Keep up the good work!
5,Bought becuase of Tressa's recommendation on goodreads,"Needless to say, she wasn't wrong. Great book. Hate reading books that rehash the same old subject and do the same old thing, just with different charactors. This doesn't."
3,Not bad,It's has some slow parts I wouldn't say it's a fast or slow read it's does het kinda old hearing the author describe the fog and seaweed over and over but all in all not bad
5,A Page Turner,"Well reviewed by others, I just want to add another 5 Star rating to this fine author's work. I tend to fall asleep reading unless it's one hell of an engaging read. Such was the case with this book and can't wait to see what Curran comes up with next."
4,"Awesome book, but not completely","Don't get me wrong, this is one great book. I agree about the pacing and the well fleshed out characters. My only quible is the final wrap up. Things seemed to fall into place just too easily for the heros. Still, it's a good book, and I'd recommend it to anybody fond of horror mysteries."
2,Best for wheat free,"Luckily I read the reviews here first and checked out this book at my library before buying it. If your child has multiple allergens, I suggest you do the same. If you have relied on processed foods until now, this book may be helpful and her tone is certainly enthusiastic. However, if you're experienced in the kitchen, this book is a big waste of time and money. Just get out your Joy of Cooking and omit whatever your child is allergic too and you'll have this book."
1,Not good for dairy or eggs.,"I am thankful that I borrowed this book from the library first. Almost EVERY recipe calls for butter, sour cream, milk, or egg. It is so bad it is almost funny. Example Buttermilk Pancakes - egg free variation: omit eggs. Dairy free variation - Replace milk with rice milk, and replace butter with margarine. All this book has is a collection of recipes that are not good for dairy allergic people with substitutions at the bottom of almost every recipe. I can do this with any recipe I don't need a special cookbook to tell me to replace milk with rice milk. When I read the cover of the book - More than 150 recipes that are: Wheat Free, Gluten Free, Dairy Free, Nut Free, Egg Free, and Low in sugar - I have to laugh. O and if you are allergic to nuts this book gives you some truly profound advice: Omit Nuts."
3,Not for a dairy-free diet,"My son is allergic to dairy and soy. This cookbook is not very useful for him, as most recipies contain at least one dairy ingredient. Furthermore, the suggested substitutions typically either say ""omit cheese"" or suggest using a soy-based dairy substitute. The author suffers from Celiac Disease, and this seems to be the basis for the cookbook. The few recipies I can use are good, so I plan to copy these recipies and give the book to a friend whose daughter has Celiac Disease."
5,real recipes,"My kids and my husband liked the recipes I used from this book. I actually got some good food ideas that I will use for my husband's birthday party. The Doughnut Cake is awsome! My teenagers couldn't believe it was made from rice flour. Finally, an allergy cookbook that I will use more than one recipe in it! Thanks"
1,not allergy free,Just reading the samples from the pop up for this cookbook reveals that there are allergens in almost all reciepes. Butter is dairy!! You can't make an allergy free cookbook and say just leave out the eggs or use egg free mayonaise. The mayonaise is soy based. More allergens. You will be better off creating your own less complicated reciepes with your own substitutes at home.
2,misrepresented,"After reading thru this book, I wished I had saved my money. This IS a recipe book with kid favorites in it. At the end of each recipe is a note how to make it dairy free, egg-free, nut free, etc. Let me save YOU some money. In the book, if a recipe calls for milk, cheese, or butter - soy milk, soy cheeses or vegetable margarine is the substitute. If it calls for eggs - use egg replacer. If it calls for a nut oil - use olive oil. If it calls for pasta - use gluten free pasta. If it calls for wheat flour - use rice flour instead. You now have the basis for this books food allergy cooking. (we also have soy allergy so all the replacements of soy and margarine are of no use to me.) The only saving grace for this book is the shopping hints in the front of the book, about 10 pages."
2,Misleading Title,"The subtitle of the book implies that all the recipes are free of the allergens listed, but that is erroneous. I was very disappointed in this book because most of the recipes include at least one or more of the items the subtitle clains that they're free of."
1,very dissappointed,"Simply put, the title is very misleading as is some of the information in the cookbook. My son is allergic to dairy, beef, soy and possibly wheat and I thought this book would be my answer to finding foods that my entire family would enjoy. The recipes are not very allergy friendly and simply stating to 'omit cheese' or 'substitute soy' is not helpful. Also it says in the front that Nestle chips are dairy free and they clearly state on the package that it contains milk. What if your child was severely allergic to milk, as mine is, and you did not check for yourself? Truly irresponsible of the author. What a waste of money!"
2,Wish I had bought a different book,"Really disappointed with this cookbook, and I don't even know if I will use it. Really wish I had bought a different one, there are just so many to choose from. The thing about this one is, these recipes are not dairy free and egg free, etc., like it claims, but almost all of them have this stuff in them but with suggested substitutions to the side on some of them. And then on some the author says you can't substitute eggs in this one...well then why is it even in there?? It is deceptive and I wouldn't buy it."
4,Livesaver!,"This is a great book for those of you whose children have allergies. Unfortunately for me, my daughter has some that are a little more difficult - dairy, soy & gluten. The bonus in the way this book is written is that it provides substitutions to the original recipe if there are ingredients that don't work for your allergy combo. If you know a little about cooking you can even stretch this farther by spinning off your own. My kids are happy that they can share food now and my daughter is thrilled to eat things that resemble the food other kids eat (like the goldfish crackers!). The only recipe that flopped for me was the chocolate cake I tried to make for my daughter's birthday. Although I followed it to the letter, it took twice as long to cook and tasted like cardboard. I would try it again though another time - just seeing her thrill at actually eating cake was enough for me (she liked it by the way, just us who are used to 'real' cake thought it was gross)."
1,Awful!,This cook book was awful! It didn't help me one bit when I started dealing with my child's food allergies. I thought the recipes would come without having to make all of these modifications on my own. I would never suggest this book to a friend! (OR a stranger for that matter!)
3,Cheap Knock Off Of Saving Private Ryan,"This game is fun to play but is obviously a copy of SPR. First,you fight your way off Omaha Beach. Then you move through theHedgerows. And of course, you SAVE Pvt. Mccurkee! This is a fun FPSand its a deal for the money but, watch out, the graphics [are thegreatest] (aboutthe same as DOOM). END"
3,Archaic graphics and interface,"This game looks like it was developed during the time of the first Duke Nukem. The graphics are rudimentary and most of the game just seems old. There's even a DOS sound setup menu! It's a fun, arcade style game but the terrible graphics and clunky keyboard commands make it not worthwhile. For example, if you see an enemy above you, you have to press Page Up to raise your weapon to one of several preadjusted heights. You really can't tell if you are going to hit what you are aiming at."
3,What a writer ...,"The story of his family and his coming of age is incredible, and incredibly told. It will carry you away. If Marquez had not spent quite as much time giving one pargaraph to each of his acquantances in what amounts to an excercise in name dropping, and spent less time describing his debauchery, I would have given this 5 stars."
2,The book is a bore,"I love Garcia Marquez's fiction and was looking forward to reading the first installment of his autobiography. But I couldn't finish it, and I certainly won't be bothering with the next two.While there are some intriguing parts, overall this book was deadly boring and extremely hard to follow. It reminded me of someone giving a speech after accepting a lifetime achievement award: ""And I'd like to thank Fred and George and Jim and Bob and a whole bunch of other people you don't care about...""I managed to plod through about two-thirds of it before I stopped punishing myself and put it aside. Unless you're a love-blinded fan who's going to adore anything he writes, don't waste your time and money."
1,Living to tell the tail by Gabriel Garcia Marquez,"This is the weakest book Mr. Marquez ever wrote-a living proof that autobiographies written by the writers are sentimental drag. His usual style of fantastic truth and romatic albeit very sad fantasy is nowhere to be found. If you love Marquez, do not read this book."
5,Like stepping into a beautiful dream . . .,Reading Marquez' work is like stepping into the most excellent dream where every one of your senses is put on red alert.The first volume in a planned autobiographical triology is no different from his fiction. You cannot read it quickly. You cannot scan the pages. You'll miss something important/beautiful/exquisite tucked into a sentence or a paragraph if you do.Marquez' gifts are legion. Do yourself a favor. Get this book and then block out some time each day to travel through time with one of the world's greatest wordsmiths.
3,"A magical start, but then reality sets in...","About a third of the way through this book I was thinking, ""Wow! This is the best autobiography I've ever read."" His recollection of visiting Aracataca with his mother to sell his grandparents' house was wonderfully evocative. It reminded me of what I love about his fiction. But the book was tough to finish. The weight of so many characters with confusing names almost dragged me under. At least for non-Spanish readers, this book needs a ""dramatis personae"". I wish I had compiled one for myself, and I recommend anyone starting this book to do so.The editors must have been afraid to do their job. A couple of times, the same story or phrase was repeated. The latter half of the book is disjointed and rambling.I was dismayed to find that this is only the first of three volumes. I think I'll pass on the rest of them."
3,Expected more,"I am a big fan, and although it's not a bad book I expected more from him. I had the following problems with the book:1) Editing - It could easily have been 25% shorter, in addition several stories are repeated. I've seen this often in famous authors. I guess either their books are not edited at all, or the editor is afraid to do his job.2) The translation--There are sentences that do not make sense. I read them over several times, and they are just poorly written.3) Maybe the book shouldn't have been translated. There's quite a bit of Colombian politics whic probably strikes a chord among South Americans, but I was lost.4) I got the feeling several times that he was writing the book to thank people who had helped him get his start, which slowed down the pace of the book"
2,A fascinating life isn't always a fascinating read,"There were parts of Garcia Marquez's memoir that kept me turning the pages voraciously. Unfortunately, this only describes about 25% of the book. The rest of the book is little more than a list of names. It's almost as if ""Gabo"" felt he had to mention every person he ever met during the first 30 years of his life.As an American reader, I found the lack of elaboration on his relationship with Fidel Castro frustrating, though I can understand why he may have felt it was inappropriate for this book.Overall, I came away with a better understanding of how one of my favorite authors was shaped during his youth. It's just surprising how such a skilled writer could put out a book including so many pages of tedious irrelevance.I recommend the book for avid fans of Garcia Marquez, but I doubt anyone else will be interested."
2,Dying to Hear the Tale....if there is one,"One almost feels blasphemous giving Gabriel Garcia Marquez a less-than stellar rating! But I found 'Living to Tell the Tale' a very tedious read. There were brief moments of true poetry within this thick volume and it was interesting to read about the experiences that later inspired his writing, but overall it was just - well, boring! I couldn't even finish the last few chapters because I just had no reason to care. Nothing was sustaining my interest whatsoever. I sure hope the next two volumes have more substance and focus, because I'm Dying to Hear the Tale ...if there is indeed one to be told."
2,Stream of Consciousness in need of editing,Occasional flashes of Marquez brilliance punctuate an otherwise completely muddy picture. I will not be buying the second volume of this autobiography.
1,Never got it!,"I never got the book. I did not even get a tracking number. I am really really unhappy about the purchase. I am sure the book itself is great, I know some of the authors..."
5,"Great Fun -- and Very Educational, Too!","My girlfriend's son loved all the full-color stickers of his favorite ""Between the Lions"" characters. And the word-play stickers that accompany them really helped him with his reading skills. Excellent!"
5,Wrong Product,"I ordered the 6 inch thimble. The packaging and packing list both said 6 inch but the thimble was actually a 8 inch. When I emailed the vendor they said the manufacturer had packaged it wrong, they apologized and said they would make arrangments for the return freight with a full refund. I ended up with a full refund and they decided not to ship the product back. Even though I did not get the thimble I needed I am completely satisfied with the way the vendor handled it."
1,Unhappy with adapter,I am not electronically savy. I owned an Olympus Stylus that I purchased in 2007 (the XD card is much larger then what they sell now) and bought a Cannon Selphy to print my pictures. The XD card for my camera would not work in the Cannon so I ordered this XD adapter; however my XD card would not work in it. The adapter does not come with any direction's so all I could do was guess at what to do with it.
1,garbage,"will not fit camera, waste of money, cannot close door after inserting card and adapter do not buy this product"
2,It was a gamble,"I have been unable to purchase the correct card for my machine, and this adapter looked like it might work.It did not! My gamble, my lost!frank"
3,unknown,I thought this was memory card & adapter. Can't give review as I haven't used yet.The delivery was very fast
5,Good Tops!,My son wears them all the time. They go with almost everything he wears. I wash and line-dry them..no dryer.
2,Too short,"I rolled the dice getting Fruit of the Loom again, after they didn't fit so well the first time I bought them. They're cheap, though, and I'd lost some weight since the first time, so I figured I'd give them another go.Nope. They still slip out of my pants' waist way too easily.They're too short. Other vendors make the same sizes with just an extra inch or two of fabric at the bottom for a nice, firm tuck. Fruit of the Loom is not among those vendors."
4,basic t shirt,"These are nothing fancy, they are also fairly thin, which I like, but others may have a different opinion.They aren't the best quality either, at least one of the t-shirts had a tiny hole in it when I got it out of the packet. However I wasn't really expecting much for the price and only got these as cheap undershirts or for wearing around the house/gym so it didn't really bother me much.Overall I am happy with this purchase."
3,ok vree nevk t shirts,These friut of the loom t shirts are ok. They doshrink alot after going threw the dryer. The material feels verycheap and thin i woild think twice about ordering these t shirts
5,So incredibly comfortable,"I bought these originally to stencil and sell, but they were so comfortable I ended up keeping them. I wear them to the gym.They are big - loose and easy to fall in love with. I sometimes sleep in one. No tags so no scratching.10/10"
3,"Good, but nor warming.","In cold places like Minnesota, I can easily feel the advantage that all-cotton Ts have over these. These are made for hot summer days when you need to be cooled, not for cold weather."
1,Only one cover,"The title for this item states ""Custom Made Front/Rear Bucket Seat Covers"" which would lead you to believe it is a set of covers. However, this is not the case. This is a single seat cover for $120. The material is very nice and does appear to be of sturdy construction, but I was barely willing to spend the money on a complete set so there is no way I will be paying this for a single cover. Sending it back to Amazon. I can get my current seats completely re-upholstered for less than $300 or hit a junk yard. I just wanted good covers because I abuse my seats with oil, soda, etc."
2,An overated composer,"If you like over the top classical music, you'll love this one...you're probably in that category of people that like pieces such as the ""Blue Danube"" and other Straussy types of things (where's the puke bucket?). For those of you not versed in such drivel, Rachmoninoff (spelling? ah..who cares?), is like the Glenn Miller of classical music: can hit the notes, even creatively, but the malaise is always there. It's like reading Catch-22, with the jokes edited out."
4,so glad i found this book,"I first saw this wonderful book at the Queens Museum of Art gift shop in New York at the site of the 2 New york world's fairs (1939 & 1964). The items are very well catalogued and fascinating to look at. I am an artist who likes to paint images of these fairs, and this book is an invaluable resource to me. Thank you for it!"
5,As good as it gets.,You won't go wrong with this one. Rubinstein plays Chopin Waltzes as they are meant to be played. This one is a treasure.
4,It wasn't what I expected but very good....,Overall I really enjoyed the book. It brought to light on how I feel that most women should carry themselves. In some areas like on attitude of the lady should have been much more detailed. Some women won't get that concept or percieve what she is saying correctly without having proir knowledge of know how to carry themselves. To me you either have it or you don't but anyone can get to that point. Some of the sexual references and ideas were on point. Good Job Miss T! Looking for your next book!
1,I wish I could give away for free,"This book was a complete mess, a lot of what she is saying is already known. I see why she did not want to reveal her real name. For fear that someone will ask for their money back!!"
2,"Great seller, horrible book.","Vendor/seller was superb. Fast delivery, great condition that matched description. However, the book is really bad. Terrible writing, not as professional or polished as I'd expected. It's more gutter-street writing that tries too hard and fails miserably. Terrible book, in my opinion."
1,Predictable,"There is nothing original in this text - no healing power within. I could have written as well or better, and I am certainly no writer. Don't waste your money."
5,"Pastors, Elders, Administrators, All church ""Leadership"" - READ THIS BOOK!","This book is well written and deals with a very sad but very real issue in churches today.Attitudes will mostly trickle down from who ever is in ""charge"". That means all you who are shepherding or assisting in the shepherding of the flock-including Sunday School teachers and the like.We need to get serious about the mission. We need to let the prodigals come home and not just through the back door."
5,Just What I Needed,"This was a much needed book for one deeply wounded by my church family. If people in your church or other Christians have mistreated you or acted in ways that left you wondering if they even knew Christ as their Savior or what Christianity is all about than this is a book for you. Mr. Burchett not only deals with those who have gotten hurt, but with those doing the hurting. Every Christian would benefit from reading this book.I would recommend you read with a spirit to heal and become more like Christ and not with a spirit to condemn others. We are all flesh and act in the flesh more than we do in the spirit. If each of us focused on our relationship with God and being right with Him we would have a church united and functioning as God intended. This is brought out in this book. It begins with you.This is a wonderful book and I highly recommend you read."
4,Nice car but photo is deceptive.,The photo shows all 4 rip-stick racers. You only get MATER with this deal. The other individual listings show just one car. Was a little disappointed when opening the box to just see the one. Amazon should fix the listing.
4,"Just a good, reliable cable!","Nothing fancy, a sturdy cable that works well with all my Guitars. I have a Fender Tele, Yamaha LP Clone w/SD pups, Samick Jazz Box w/SD pups. Can't go wrong with this brand."
3,"Caution: It does not ""whistle""",This is a beautiful tea kettle BUT it does not whistle. It makes a sound more like a low volume smoke detector. If you are expecting that beautiful whistling sound you will be very disappointed as I was. I will be returning it.
5,Surprisingly entertaining,"This book came to me by chance and I had no intention of reading all of it. However, reading one fairy tale led to another and then another. Each story gave me a chuckle and several a hearty laugh. The old fairy tales take on an amazingly fresh feeling with Jasheway's creativity. Her writing makes it clear that she has spent many hours with her canine companions. She writes the bedtime stories with the insight of one who loves her dogs.I found the book very entertaining and easy to read. At less than 100 pages, you may be tempted to read it at one sitting but if you do you will lose out on days of innocent ""feel-good"" entertainment.This would be a great gift for dog lovers of all ages. It is the perfect gift for anyone who needs cheering up, or for yourself - whether you have a dog or not."
5,My favorite knife,This knife is my first choice for small tasks. I bought this one as a replacement for my original which was lost in a move.
1,Panasonic - terrible customer service,"After two months, this phone stopped working. It was returned to Panasonic Repair and we received a notice thirty days later saying that the phone was back ordered and delivery would be in 6-8 weeks. This is not customer service. Panasonic should have refunded the purchase price or offered a comparable or better phone. When called today to check on status of order, answer was basically ""tough luck."" Never again, Panasonic. Amazon should discontinue this brand."
1,Let the buyer beware,This phone did not work. I called the Panasonic service center and was told that items bought on Amazon did not have a warranty since Amazon was not an approved retailer. Finally was able to get a return voucher which I did not use since the additional mailing charge would have almost equalled what I had already paid for the phone.
2,not a good phone,I bought this phone twice and both times after several months had problems with it. A phone should be able to last at least 5 years not have problems after 7 months. This time the problem is the speaker phone is not working well. So twice bought and twice had problems within 1 year. How can I recommend this phone?
5,It does the job,I've had this phone a month now and it works fine. The directions were very clear on how to connect my lines and how all the features work. I've talked to a few people using the speakerphone and they tell me my voice comes through very clearly. Since I have 2 lines it fulfills my purpose perfectly and at a great price.
4,Great 2 Line Phone for the price.,I use the phone in a busy restaurant and it works great. Its a good constructed phone and for the price its a win win.
4,2-Line Phone,"Unit performs exactly as advertised. A little disappointed in the sound quality while on speakerphone, but overall a very good buy for the money."
3,"Basic 2-line phone, some volume issues","For the price, this is a decent value but because of some volume issues, I'm currently looking for a replacement. Incoming voice quality is good however it seems that this phone will soften or muffle your voice when you speak into the headset. This isn't a major problem if you routinely talk somewhat loudly into the headset but if you talk softly, you may find that you will need to speak up in order for the other party to hear you adequately."
1,Cheap Junk - avoid it,This phone lasted about 2 years. Then the socket for a headset stopped working. The sound quality remains less than mediocre and my family refuses to use it. Avoid. I have had older models and they lasted nearly 10 years. Panasonic should be ashamed of itself.
4,Panasonic KX-TS208W 2-Line Intergrated Phone System,Great product. Great price. Replaced similar unit at least 10 years old and very reliable. I'll probably buy another soon.
1,Terrible Phone,"Terrible service, Terrible phones. DO NOT GET anything PANASONIC. Called support and was transfered around the world before they said they would call me back, They DID NOT. Purchased another phone and they worked on first try."
3,Panasonic Phone,The phone has poor sound when speaking into the handset. The sound over modulates and distorts. When the first line is in use you can hardly hear the second line ringing.
2,Big Disappoint,"I tried twice to like this phone, both times the ringer gave out after a few months. Tried the cordless and found the overall quality of PANASONIC has gone downhill...fast.Pros: good audio, easy to useCons: Not reliable, quality of all PANASONIC products have gotten terrible. No backlight caller ID.I wanted to love this phone but after two corded and two cordless I have given up on PANASONIC."
4,Great Value!,I bought this telephone for the church of which I am the treasurer. We needed a new 2 line phone for our pastor's office so I checked here at Amazon.com and found this model. It is perfect. Not fancy and easy to use.
2,"Ok, but NO caller ID???","I almost never write reviews, but now I am annoyed.Overall, a satisfactory two line phone. The display is not readable from a sitting position. This, however, is generally ok, since the phone lacks caller ID. Why anyone would design a phone with a display but no caller ID circuit is a mystery to me (how much could they save? $1 on the chip???). I didn't realize that the phone didn't have caller ID, in fact, it never occurred to me to look to see.Its best features are that it has two lines, the sound is clear, and conference and hold options work well.Its less good features are that it does not have caller ID, and has fewer features than most cordless phones, certainly less features than cordless phones that have two lines."
5,Classic,"Very addictive arcade classic, unfortunately came to me FILTHY, but a cotton swab and rubbing alcohol did the trick. Ran like a dream after the cleaning."
2,buy my BREASTFRIEND,"i thought this would be very helpful but found it cumbersone - had to prop pillows behind my back, when i moved with my baby i had to readjust - if you're a big person it doesn't fit right & if you had an epidural (and many sticks) you want something to support your back so you don't lean over so much - i bought an inflatable pillow that already has built in back support - it's called MY BREASTFRIEND - they also make them in solid foam - ... the inflatable one is compact and you can take it anywhere (saves a lot of space)- has a side pocket for the phone and small items - the lactation dept in the hospital should have theses available - along with a foot stool, you'll be very comfy"
3,Description is misleading,One of the cds in this series truly has a jazzy flow but this one does not. It is still a good cd to play for your children but I believe the description is very misleading.
4,Good mid-range Japanese-style knife,"I'd say this knife met my expectations, although contrary to the other reviews I read, I didn't find this knife substantially sharper than any other mid-priced knife I've purchased. I bought this as a sample to determine the differences between the Japanese style and German style knives to see which I preferred; the differences are about what one would expect: this knife cuts more at a diagonal due to the single-sided cutting edge, which must be compensated for. Still, it's a fine carving knife.Pros:Looks very nice, even compared to more expensive knivesCuts as well as Henckels' International series, once the diagonal is adjusted forCons:Matte blade surface is an interesting appearance, but makes it somewhat harder to cleanHandle is rather lightweight for a knife of this lengthFor an introductory Japanese knife, this one is decent, especially considering its low price when compared to the mid-grade German knives."
5,wasabi knives,"Of the three knives I bought, this is the one I use the most and seems to be excellent for all kinds of peeling and carving. Very sharp!!!"
3,Has a plastic handle,I bought the knife as a gift so I never used it. It is worth noting however that it has a plastic handle that is cheap looking. They say that it is impregnated with bamboo. It may be better for clean up but I expected it would look nicer.
3,Poor finish,"The finish on the knife is something like a matte or media blasted finish. If you want it for sushi, be prepared to sand and polish the entire knife blade for many hours."
2,another disappointment,"Fist of the Vampire had more potential than Curse of the Wolf, but succeeded slightly. Fist of the Vampire is kung fu vampire flick, that barely had vampire stuff in it. Darian Caine also is in it, she's better in this than in Curse of the Wolf."
2,"Great topic, horrible execution.","The worst sin a book about Urban Legends could commit is to confuse the reader about what is fact, and what is fiction. This book does that time after time. The author hops around between Urban Legend and the truth that may have inspired it, and the writing is so poor that you can't keep track of what's what. The book is also filled with nonsensical run-on sentences; I often had to go back and reread certain sentences 3 or 4 times before just giving up. This book looks and reads like somone published it from their basement. N.E. Genge goes on my list of ""Must-NOT-Read"" Authors.People interested in a well-done book on the same topic should start with Paradox Press' excellent ""Big Book of Urban Legends""."
2,Packed with info but abysmally written.,"If ever a book cried out for a competent editor, this is the one. It's rife with misspellings, typos and incredibly obtuse prose. While it does fulfill its stated purpose of being a compendium of both classic and contemporary urban legends, it's an exhausting read because of its startling lack of polish. And if you find you're interested in learning whether or not a particular legend is true or even based in truth, I hope you're the patient type: the author often waits several pages before deciding to comment on the veracity of a story, sometimes saving up multiple stories and commenting on them collectively. That's when she chooses to weigh in on a tale's truthfulness at all, mind you. There are definitely better titles in this genre, not to mention the great Web sites covering the same territory."
2,Pale imitation,Amazing how much of the material in this book came right off the Urban Legends Reference Pages web site. Save your money and visit the real thing.
5,Humble Pockets,"I purchased this fifty cent pocketbook from my favorite bookseller on B Street in downtown Hayward, California way back in 1969. This is classic B.C. these strips are from the fab sixties when Johnny Hart was only being topped in popularity by Charles M. Schulz's: ""Peanuts""Johnny, had a way of making this wacky cast of stone age hipsters some very cool customers indeed. Let's just say that I think B.C. is one of the very best comic strips produced during my time on the planet. This is great reading and a visual funfest for the eyes as well.Four & 1/2 Stars!"
2,Only Price is worth it,"This was my first Butterfly, bought in the Sixties, and so Leontyne Price is imprinted in my min for this role, one she neer sang on stage. Her voice is really too big and lush for Cio-cio San, but that hardly matters given her ravishing singing. What does matter, unfortunately, is the stiff, unyielding conducting of Leinsdorf and the trumpet-like bawling of Tucker. both are so bad that it is hard to listen to this set anymore, especially with so many fine alternatives around."
2,Huge Disapointment!,"I LOVE leontyne price!!! Really! But she did not do a good job in this particular recording of butterfly!!!! It seems like she was much more worried about sounding like a 15 year old girl than doing her natural extraordinary sound....Huge mistake, in my opinion. Don't buy this one...."
2,nice,"This is a nice Butterfly, but not the best. I like the Freni/Pavarotti better. Leontyne's voice is lovely. But she is not in the same league as Mirella Freni."
3,dissapointing despite glorious voices,"There is no denying the glory of the voices of Leontyne Price and Richard Tucker, but it is a stretch to imagine her as a 15-year-old geisha and him as a callous youth. They are both in superb form but rather unconvincing dramatically. Price's attempts at girlishness are embarrassing to listen to, she would have been better advised to sing the role ""straight"" and just lighten her voice in the conversational and intimate passages. Despite her unique vocal beauty, I just don't find the role suits her very well and she does not adapt it very well either. Tucker sings well but with little charm - Pinkerton may be callous but he is also a seducer - I find him more successful in his La Traviata and La Boheme recordings of about the same time, however the beauty and steadiness of the singing is a reward in itself. The rest of the cast is fine and the sound good but I much prefer the earlier RCA set with Moffo/Valletti who sound much more convincing."
5,Leontyne Price is a Revelation,"I know there are other recordings of Butterfly out there with Tebaldi, Scotto, Freni and others. They are all great singers.But---Nothing replaces Leontyne Price's devastating characterization of Butterfly. I have known this recording since I was about 12 years old and as I have grown older, my admiration and love for this Butterfly has increased.Leontyne Price's voice is one of the wonders of the 20th century and here in this recording it is captured at its prime. Her high notes are the glory of opera. The interpolated high note at the end of her entrance music has never been equaled.If you are only after one Butterfly recording, THIS IS IT. If you are collecting a number of them, there are other options.one word of caution: if you choose this Butterfly, be aware that it will forever spoil this opera for you as you will not be able to listen to another one without feeling that something is profoundly missing."
3,Low end phone hiding in a mid end packaging....,"Having owned the Snapper a few years, I was looking forward to upgrade to the Cyclops. This Kyocera phone seemed like an improvement over the older UT Starcom model because of it's slimmer casing, internal antenna, and a 1.3 MP camera. However, I ended up keeping my old phone because I can't get over the many flaws of the Cyclops. I'll briefly summarize:PROS:-small form factor-internal antenna-1.3 MP camera-colorful design-external displayCONS:-audio interference (white noise) possibly caused by antenna-when opened, phone bends too far back and is uncomfortable to hold-large external red LED flashes continuously during calls-text messaging is a pain because of small buttons and software glitches-average quality internal LCD display with childish graphics-camera quality about the same as higher end 0.3 VGA MP cameras"
2,Mediocre at best,"I bought this phone about one month ago. I rarely upgreade phones but I really wanted a camera phone so I bought this model because of its price. I now wish I could return it or throw it away. I usually love flip phones because I find their quality to be better but this is not the case with the Cyclops. The red light on the outside flashes constantly which is annoying. When texting the letters often get scrambled because of a software glitch so the message is completely incoherent. I often have to erase and then rewrite it several times. The camera is horrible too. Every picture is either too bright or dark and they are very grainy. In addition, sometimes when I check my pictures the phone just turns off by itself for no reason. I believe this is another software glitch.I would go ahead and spend the extra money on a better model if looking for a phone that you would like to use."
4,pretty good,I had this phone for about 7 or 8 months and it was fine. The texting was kinda hard but not too bad. I wanted a new phone so a couple of days ago i bought the arc from virgin mobile and it has bean great if you want a really good phone with some great features buy the arc because it is cheap at only 49.99 and has a camera and someother great stuff too. check it out.
2,ughh kinda crappy,"I ""upgraded"" to this model when it was $100 at BEST BUY. From Day 1 its been 1 problem after the other.. The texting isnt very solid. The phone would turn off in mid text for no reason. Camera sucks. Speakerphone volume is very low even when put to max. Try finding a car-charger for it in any store!!! The regular charger just stopped working 1 day out of the blue as well. the Yahoo/AOL feature doesnt connect anymore now too...lol Virgin Mobile had to send me a replacement when the screen permanently went blank 1 day. WAACCCCKKKK!!!"
3,Doesn't stand alone.,"This text was informative for the student just begining their anatomy and physiology education. However I believe it was put to best use when combined with another anatomy text (i.e.Tortora's Principles of Human Anatomy). These two texts are a powerhouse of information. They play well off of eachother. Where Tortora lacks in technical explanation and precise description Sherwood excells. Where Sherwood fails in graphic visual description Tortora more than makes up the difference. As a visual learner it was difficult to fully grasp certain concepts without another text to refer to. I believe for someone who learns best from verbal description this book would be incredibly beneficial. I used this text in a community college, pre-nursing, anatomy and physiology course and although it was helpful, it provided more of a complete picture when combined with the other text (Tortora). Overall I did find it more helpful as a reference resource than a teaching tool."
5,An Rts classic Masterpiece,"I have played many games of this genere, including starcraft, all the redalert games, dark reign, galatic battle grounds, panzer general, warloards battlecry, and countless others. Yes, all those games were good, but none have had more of a ""fun factor"" as this game has. With a large selection of units, including sumerseibles, boats, air units, infantry, and tanks, this game sports imense replay value. This game was the first game I have ever seen use the super weapons, as well as the only game that provides ways to defend against them. Rather then garbage base defenses as were in starcraft, base defense, such as the punisher and the ""big bertha"" shoot farther distances then the mobile units can giving a purpose to actually building a defense. I highly reccommend this game, it did not recieve the recignition it deserved, but I still enjoy this game above all other for its amazing replay value and well thought out structure."
1,"This game gets so old, so fast","I bought this game because it was on sale ... with the expansion. I was fun for a day. Then after that it just makes you mad. The campian is boring, also both the arm and the core are almost identicle. It is to slow. The graphics bring the game down. Plus it's way to easy on multiplayer. The comp. always rush's you with fast attack units. But with one shot from your commander and it is all over. It is hard for me to sit down for ten minutes."
4,Wapiti Pete,"I find Hal Borland to be one of the most sensitive nature writers of the 20th century. ""King of Squaw Mountain"" is every bit as exciting and engaging as any of Jack London's novels. It is short enough so you can read it in one or two sittings, which you will probably do, as you find yourself hoping for justice for the villain and the scrappy elk. If your only previous exposure to Borland was through required reading of ""When the Legends Die"", please pick this one up, and I'm betting you will not put it down until the last page!"
5,Great game,This game is the best soccer game for PlayStation 2. You can control the players better than FIFA and the player movements aren't as choppy as the other soccer games. The headers and bicycle kicks are excellent. The defense moves like they are in a real game unlike the FIFA and ESPN soccer games. Whether you like soccer or not I recommend this game.
1,dont buy this game,this is the worst soccer game you could get. Impress your friends with your new drink coaster. Buy fifa instead.
2,The worst in the series,This is a cheesy vcerson of the Christmas carol. It messed up the story line from the past to. Characters are alive that are supposed to be dead. Carface is supposed to be in Hell he got pulled down into it at the end of the second one.If you are 5 or older. The good thing about it is a lot more approapriate than the original and is rated corrected. I think the first one should have ben PG13 and the second should of been PG. Unfortunatley back then the did not have any pg13 rated cartoons until Beehives in Butt do America can out.It would have be better Ive they had put the king gator in it. Belonda is okey she is evil and wicked. But I've seen betetr. If I had a top hundred villians list see would be the 11th on the list.
4,Clever version of the classic,We watched this with our whole family - ages 6 to 46. It held all of our interest and we all thought it was super cute. It's currently available on Netflix streaming but it could definitely be worth owning the DVD as well.
5,Comments on foundations of Analog and Digital Electronic Circuits,"The book is an amazing approach to physics and elecronics with the engineer'eyes.Nice procedure is simplifiying theory in order to get instruments that allows to build real ""hardware"".A good engineer's approach to complex math and physics world.Not sure all students will appreciate the teaching style."
2,"Value for money? Yes, if you equate number of words per dollar.","I grabbed this in order to brush up on some theory prior to grad study.Haven't finished it, but so far...Way too wordy, and the maths in the examples often skips steps, making the examples less helpful than they might otherwise be. The occasional maths error lends itself to the appearance that the examples were put together by someone in a hurry.There are better textbooks out there. This is great value for money on kindle, but have to say, glad I didn't buy the print version."
4,"See the Lights, With This Visual History!","I am a fan of Simple Minds, to be honest, I am more of a casual fan that enjoys great music performances, and this is truly one of them. I bought this DVD not really knowing what I was getting and was pleasantly surprised! The combination of live concert and music video collection, all remastered picture and sound, was a nice welcomed package to add to my ever growing music and concert dvd collection. In my opinion, you don't have to be a die-hard Simple Minds fan to appreciate their good music that is well presented here."
1,Scratched and DId not Work,This product was unusable. I would like to find out with Amazon who I need to contact to get my money back. Debra Chanda
5,amazing,"The mere fact that the author puts so much effort into examining sexuality and androgeny in Japan is commendable. The book gives a lot of insight to Sexuality in Japan (mostly 2oth C.) through her analysis of the all-female Takarazuka Revue founded in 1919.Chapters include (1) Ambivalence and Popular Culture; (2) Staging Androgeny; (3) Performing Empire; (4) Fan Pathology; (5) Writing Fans.Chapters 1,2 and 3 I thought were particularly well-written and informative. Robertson does a great job examining gender roles and performances that are often very permeable (despite the fact that many people are in delian of this). great book."
4,Diary of a Domestic Goddess by Elizabeth Harbison,"Description from the book back cover:The Goddess Rulebook: Rule #1: Figure out what you want -- and go after it! Columnist Kit Macy's dream house was almost hers. Then the entire staff of her old-fashioned household magazine was fired by the new, hip, handsome boss. No job meant no mortgage, and no backyard for her four-year-old son. She needed a plan ... and decided to reinvent herself. Rule #2: Change is good. Hotshot editor Cal Panagos intended to revamp the magazine -- from its staff to its stories. But the stubborn single mom's desire to succeed -- and her beautiful eyes -- soon got under his skin, while Kit's ideas breathed life into his publication. Working closely day after day, Cal began to forget the most important rule of all: Never mix business with pleasure ..."
2,Bad DVD reproduction,"I love MacGyver and I really love this DVD set but unfortunately the DVD quality is that of an old VHS tape. I was extremely disappointed with the video quality but I loved Mac enough to keep the set. I bought my set about a year ago off of Amazon, perhaps they are better now??"
4,"I like it, but...","I'm satisfied with the product. But this was the first time I bought something from amazon.com, and I forgot to check which subtitle-languages was included... (I'm from Norway, so English isn't my mothertongue) And there's no subtitles on this product. No big deal, but remember to check it!"
1,Beware of Dishonest Seller,"Four of the dvd's in the MacGyver TV show were bad and would not play. The seller sent me new ones but they would not play either. The seller has refused to respond to my attempts to have him send me dvd's that work. He is just ignoring my emails, so please beware of buying anything from him."
3,Glad to have it!,"First off I must say I am a die hard MacGyver fan and nothing would have stopped me from buying this for the right price. The movies are also included in this box, so there is no need to buy them seperately. But be warned your disc docter will get a workout because the packaging is cardboard and so are the dividers between the discs."
5,Loved it.,I bought this as a gift for my husband---great series---he loves it. The show has great story lines and acting.
3,JUST TERRIBLE PACKAGING,I've viewed two seasons of the package and at least three of the discs have severe skips and stalls in several episodes. I have placed every disc in an individual sleeve to prevent further damage. The transfer is acceptable and except for the horrid packaging the set is acceptable.
3,Great product but CHEAP packaging!,"My husband and I are ardent Macgyver fans. I got this as a Father's Day gift for him this year. Amazon shipping was fast as usual, but lo and behold, when we got it we were SHOCKED to see how small the DVD set is and how CHEAP the packaging is! We were expecting something better, more spectacular to hold our beloved Macgyver DVDs. The packaging is all made of paper and doesn't seem like it will last very long.The DVD qualities are OK. After spending so much you would think at least the DVDs would be held in some sort of plastic cases, not in paper cases. I guess this type of packaging is better for the environment, but it certainly is not up to standard for a complete season set! We were very disappointed. 5 stars for the series, 1 star for the packaging, thus the 3-star rating!"
5,Just Love Macgyver!!!,"We just love that Macgyver! Why there are no longer shows like this, we don't understand. This is the kind of stuff we want to watch. Good clean viewing with a little humor, lots of action, a little romance and good old-fashioned values! Somewhat educational, too. Shows that persons of all ages can watch, without worry, and feel good. The plots are sometimes a bit ""corny"" or dated, but it's nice to know the good guy will win in the end; we still love to watch! Good job, Richard Dean Anderson! It's nice to finally have these on DVD to watch as we please (like during dinner). Sound, picture and DVD quality were good. DVD's are nicely packaged for protection. Would gladly purchase again!"
3,Great series; has everything except packaging.,"I was a real fan of MacGyver; I never missed an episode, even if I had to record it on VHS. When this package was listed on Amazon for a very good discount, I had to have it.And I'm not disappointed with the series (and the two made-for-TV movies). My problem, like most of the other reviews I've seen, is with the packaging. The DVD's do not come in any kind of protective sleeve, and, in my opinion, they can be easily damaged. It is just a super poor way to release a classic series.My next purchase will be a package or three of bulk CD sleeves..."
3,"great series, poor presentation","As other reviewers have mentioned, the packaging for this product virtually ensures the discs will arrive damaged. Sure enough, on the first disc I put in two of the four episodes will not play. It's not available for replacement (although I don't know that I want another of these), so sending it back for a refund is my only option. Not a good customer experience here."
3,"Got it, Like it, Bur...","I got this set for $124.99 I would rate the content higher but I have been having some technical difficulties viewing it. I only have viewed season 1 so far, but I am having the strangest problem with the disk stopping, then skipping. But the real strange part: I will be watching an episode and after a cut-scene instead of going to the next scene in that episode it goes to the next scene of a different episode on the disk. I fix this by going to the main menu and reselecting the episode I was watching and I get right to the spot that was cut off. This has happened to me at least a half dozen times so far. This is completely wierd stuff that never happened to me before, and I have hundreds of DVD's in my collection!"
2,why no seperate dvd of the tv movies?,"I bought each and every season of this show as soon as it came out. I have all 7 seasons, and am waiting for the 2 TV movies to be put out. Now they are coming out with the entire series, which is supposed to include the tv movies, but no seperate release of the TV movies. I am mad. They should give us the tv movies seperately as several people paid out good money for each season release. Boo Paramount!!I just saw this set at Target. Yes folks, the tv movies are in the complete series set. Again, why not release the movies seperately as well?"
3,Disappointed in the packaging!,I am a big Richard Dean Anderson fan. I love the series but I agree with the other peoples opinions on the packaging. It is bad. I have already ruined one DVD because as I struggle to get the DVD's from the back of the box the ones in the front fall out. Flimsy.
4,Love it!,"I jumped at the chance to get this when it was on sale. I watched this show every freakin day and always loved the stuff he came up with. The only thing missing in this set, other than duct-tape and a ball-point pen, was sleeves or some sort of protection for the discs. Kind of odd that they were all just sitting in the box plain-jane."
5,Only for the radical Macgyver fan...,"As you read this review you must keep in mind that most Macgyver fans already own the entire series. They more than likely have bought the DVD's as they were released as individual seasons. The best thing about this set is that it includes both of the Macgyver movies that can be found nowhere else. More than likely I'd say that they'll release the two movies on their own, so unless you have to have them right now I'd suggest waiting. Now, as for the Macgyver freak I'm sure this set is well worth the cost in spite of the relatively cheap packaging. I'd suggest buying a DVD case to store the discs in so that it doesn't take forever to find the disc you are looking for."
1,Great contendo Horrible Packaging,I love the Macgyver show but this complete sereies is just horrible. The reason for the 1 star is the packaging. I ordered my copys from Amazon and when I got them they would play part way then freeze up. The reason for this is the discs are jammed in the box and only seperated by cardboard spacers. Both of the copies I recieved were scrached on almost all the discs. At this price I would expect better packaging. I had to return this two times before I gave up. Guess I will have to rent them instead. :(
4,Play All?,"I love this series so I'll give it four stars no matter what. There is one thing that would make me buy(rebuy actually) the series in this new form and that's if it has a ""Play All"" feature. This is the one thing I miss with the sets I already have. Please somebody who knows, tell us if this new set has Play All!! Thanks."
2,So so..OK,"I usually borrow this show from the local library. I felt disappointed that is just recycled items all put in together. I was about to purchase the set and found out no extras? wow.. what a rip off.Update.. I've checked the box set on 10/16/07 and for you die hard fans, they will include the 2 Macgyver TV movies on DVD. That would somewhat of a plus for you."
1,screw this,"i also already own every season, paid $30+ for each one and now i feel ripped off. how do you justify charging so much for each individual season when you can sell the whole set at this price?also, no mention of the tv movies. if the tv movies are included and not released separately as well, i will sell all of my macgyver dvds and forget the show ever existed as that is complete b.s.finally, did anyone notice yahoo has an ""in production"" listing for a macgyver movie? what's up with that are they making a theater one?"
1,VERY Bad Box-set - I mean the BOX not the series!,"Awesome to have the complete series in one convenient pac, however, this box-set does severe damage to the DVDs that come in it. Decide for yourself if it is worth the risk. Mine are in bad condition, tried two new sets both bad. Decided to risk it, and kept the second one. It will take awhile to view all the scuffed and scratched DVDs to know if luck was on my side, or not.UPDATE: Oh yes, I had several bad episodes! It is sad because it was unnecessary damage that could have been avoided if the distributors cared enough to package their product in a different manner. I suspect that a dollar worth of felt and some glue would have prevented the serious scuffing these disks have. I managed to fast forward through several bad spots, and had to restart one episode past the bad spot and back up to the undamaged part. More hassle than it EVER should have been."
2,"Good show, shabby product","MacGyver is a great show and that is the only thing that makes it worth to buy this box set. The packaging is poor and there is no special content or extras in the DVDs - just one episode after another without intro or bonuses. I guess you get what you pay for. Still, I found it ridiculous that I had to clean most of the DVDs before playing because they came with dust and pieces of paper stuck on them. Simple packaging is excusable, but shabby packaging is not. Shame on you, Paramount. MacGyver could have assembled a much better package with some cardboard and his swiss knife..."
5,GREAT,"This is a great set of DVD's. The pakaging is a bit flimsy, but at the price I baught this at I can't really complain."
2,Paramount Subtitles,Does anybody know if this set's DVDs have English Subtitles? I don't know why Paramount never puts english subtitles for the hearing impaired on their TV series and in the UK all of their series have 6 or 7 language subtitles. Aren't the discs made in the same place?
3,avid fan of macgyver,I've been a fan of the show since it first aired in 1986. I rate this ecellent! the shows are the best I've seen in a long time.
1,"Will patiently, or not, wait for a release of the movies...","As a proud owner of the individual seasons I actually considered selling them and buying the Complete Series just to get the movies. Alas, after reviewing the reviews and peeking at a friend's recent purchase, I have decided against doing so. I love the show and want to keep my very nicely packaged individual seasons. For now I will have to do without the two movies and hope that they will eventually be released as a stand alone item."
3,Poor packaging,"As many other reviews mentioned, the packaging is poorly designed and poorly made but this does save a LOT of space...The box is about 1.5 feet long by 6""high and 4""thick so to cram about 40+ dvds in there, they had to give up individual packaging.This could be a Godsend or a complete turnoff. The content itself is NOT remastered, without special features...Just all 139 episodes plus the 2 tv movies. The quality is very enjoyable but do not expect 1080P quality from an 80's show, it would just make it look cheap."
3,A great idea,"There is a lot to recommend this DVD. It is bursting with enthusiasm. It might have been better to translate the subtitles into English, instead of only the Hebrew.The flashing back and forth from one aspect to another is quite distracting. What are we to focus on? From time to time, the director does focus on only the singers or the city-scape and this is far more preferable. The songs are well sung, for the most part and the dancing is good, for the most part. There is some fine vintage footage of the pioneers in Israel. I think Israel needs a finer version of this DVD to show the splendid works that the settlers began and what Israel has blossomed into.Ned R. Turner"
5,Solid Album,"I unequivocally assent with all the reviews on this solid effort from Capital Tax. They originally hail from Oakland, California, which is a shock to a lot of people, due to the nature of this album-----east coast vibe. I loved all the tracks on this album no exceptions, moreover, the Masha's Remix produced by my man Smooth G is arguably the best song that came out in the blessed year of '93. Hip Hop is dead, I'm not kidding, its spirits has ascended to the heavens and comfortably resting in peace. ONE!"
3,"Help with ""Old Filth""","After reading Gardam's ""Old Filth"", I turned to this book as there are references to it as being important in shaping Gardam's story. It reflects on Kipling's childhood in which the experience of spending years away from home and loving parents affected him. It is hard to say if Kipling's or ""Filth's"" experience was worse in the trauma each endured but the ramifications are clear as Filth nears death and the reader sees how much of the experience he carried to his death. Am glad to have read this short story in seeing how the one influenced the later."
1,Shallow and spurious,"The scholarship, characterizations, and dialogue, all of which are draped in thickets of pretentiousness and verbosity, give me the impression of a potboiler masquerading as intelligent literature. This book makes me wish it had been the hare torn to bits and devoured by the two eagles."
1,The Big Send Off,Why read this when you can read the original??....and in Greek....Who cares about 21st century ideas when you greek text talks of the horrors of having the heart and the mind violated.
5,Hooray for Barry Unsworth,"In 'The Songs of the Kings' Barry Unsworth proves that sometimes the best way to make social commentary and really get people to listen is to disguise it. Coming out of his amazing story you find yourself pondering questions that are quite relevant in today's world (especially in the political arena). How far are we willing to go? Who is, ultimately, capable of deciding between what is right and what is wrong? Who should be responsible for decisions like that when the outcome will effect countless numbers of people? Regardless of where you fall in the political spectrum these questions are crucial to the world today, and Barry Unsworth does an excellent job of steering you toward them without trying to answer them for you. Through the re-telling of Greek myth Unsworth has crafted a relevant, thoughtful piece of literature which will remain with you long after you turn the last page."
1,waste of time!!!!!,"I cannot believe that I actually wasted my time on this. The main character was such an idiot. She is lied to by practically everyone she loves and trusts and then drugged or manipulated into the craziest situations.Simon, the man she is in love with, is just sleazy for what he does to her. I won't even go into the quick and easy resolution of the story. If I could give this negative stars I would."
5,"Lots of great ideas, tips and techniques","This book is similar to Kelby's killer tips in that it is full of lots and lots of tips and techniques. What I really like about this book is that you get an interesting variety of suggestions from the 4 authors. Apparently, the book was written with each author throwing in their ideas - and it works! I love the fact that the book is cover-to-cover full color(donja hate books that have black and white screen shots where color is really required?)Great tips that got me taking advantage of version 7's new features, and showed me stuff that I never knew. I consider myself a pretty experienced Photoshop user (6 years), but there have already been lots of things that I have learned from this book that have made it well worth the price.I own 6 Photoshop 7 books and this one is one of my favorites!"
1,Forget this title,"Some title are good, some are great, this one is terrible... nothing new.They call it trade secrets, but if you've used Photoshop for over 10 minutes, you probaly know more than this book can teach you. Save your money."
4,Disregard Julie Waters,"Don't bother reading Julie Waters review. They saved on printing costs and included the manual for this head and the baby brother which only supports about 8 pounds. She must not have realized which one she was reading. This model does in fact support up to 13 pounds.That being said, I picked this up local and it feels sturdy enough and the ball is smooth. I'm not expert on ball heads and I know this one is relatively inexpensive compared to many other models, but I think it's fine.Giving it 4 stars because I do think it could be a little smoother.Unfortunately, I realized I can't pan accurately for panoramas with this so I'm going to exchange it for a 3-way pan/tilt head instead."
5,MANFROTTO 486 BALL HEAD,"I have used a Manfrotto 488 for years with a Baby Deardorff large format camera. It works great, but I didn't like its weight for long hikes. I purchased the 486, hoping it would be strong enough for a 6-7 lb. large format camera. The 486 is just a little over half the size and weight of the 488.I spent a week in the red rock area of Utah photographing the day after I received it. I didn't need 2 seconds to get used to it, and it more than handled the weight of a large format camera. I would recommend it to anyone with a 4x5 or 5x7 for its ease of use. Very easy to level the camera on, with its one simple lockdown, and very sturdy. It has a unique threading piece on the top that accommodates the standard 1/4, or the larger size. It simply slides down into a sleeve so nothing comes off. Easy peezy, lemon squeezy unit!!!!"
2,troubled and troubling,"I bought and played ""Nam"" a couple years ago. This may be a revised version. I've also seen it sold as ""Napalm"".Nam is a first person shooter game based on the Vietnam war. Anyone familiar with the Duke Nukem series will recognize the 3D engine/environment.There are two game scenarios with multiple levels each. Perhaps I'm a bad player, but after I reached each of the last levels I couldn't get the game to end. Or perhaps that's supposed to be symbolic of something. Either way it was disappointing.As someone old enough to have served in Vietnam (but didn't) and to know people who did, I was troubled by the Viet Cong human targets."
1,Missing something...,"The game Wolfenstein 3D is a much better 3D conversion of a war than NAM. NAM is impossibly impossible and stupid. The cover says ""based on a DOOM-style engine."" This plays nothing like DOOM. DOOM is fun. NAM is annoying. It's so hard and requires so much planning that looking forward to playing it is tedious."
4,Solid Addition to my Library,"This nice anthology has most of my favorite poems. There are many poems that I will want to read over and over again, to myself and to my children. I also have enjoyed another poetry anthology, ""Poetry for a Lifetime"", which has a similar collection of old favorites, but with added illustrations and comments from the editor. They both are great additions to any home library."
5,My Favorite Book,"This is a book my Mother, Brother and I read together when I was a child. There are many, many beautiful Poems in this collection. I have owned this book for as long as I can remember, I am 52 and I read and reread this book always finding something new and special. In this book I have found so much pleasure I am ordering a new copy because my original copy is worn and coming apart. Thank you for having the book in supply, since it was published in 1936, I thought my worn copy was irreplaceable. If I had one book, this would be that book. If you love someone, or have a special friend this is a most wonderful experience to share."
5,Everybody's Happy,"My 88 yr. old mom wanted me to find her a copy of this book so she could give it as a gift. We were both so pleased with the price and ease of this order that she decided she wanted two more copies. My wife joined in and wanted a copy. We ordered again and were still just as pleased with everything. The delivery was fast, the price was right and everybody is happy!"
5,Fantastic!! The best book of poems ever!,"My uncle owned this book, but he died before I was born. The book still circulates within my family, but is not in very good condition. That's why I am going to buy a new one. This book inspires one to read and write more poetry. Geoffrey Lawson, Milltown, Newfoundland Canada"
2,Tells me Americans don't know much about poetry.,"The two stars don't represent my opinion of the poetry, although most are sentimentalist and jingoistic, but the selection. Are these the poems of the American people? Who says these are? And, if they are, I hold American's view of poetry in very low esteem. I shouldn't be surprised that most poems are actually American, but to be honest I don't think there are half that many actually 'great' American poets. I'm not an anti-American, but come on, America isn't the greatest poetry nation, and this isn't the greatest collection of poems."
1,received wrong lens,Ordered a UV Filter lens and received a polarized lens instead. This was disappointing. I went to a local camera shop and ordered it.
5,"Great read, good history, makes 19th century Lebanon interesting!","The author knows Islamic law, as he is a scholar. But this novella is not scholarly so much as it is a gripping story about Lebanon in the middle of the nineteenth century. Told through the lens of a Hanafi Judge (Qadi) who has to deal with a variety of changes that Lebanon is undergoing, this book gives the reader a sense of how Islamic law can work, and of the ways that modernity have radically reshaped Lebanon (and the region as a whole, of course). But it is told in an engaging, fun to read style that carries along the reader, even one who is not especially interested in the region or topics related to law, etc.The book is out of print, and may remain so indefinitely. If it is available, I highly recommend it."
4,Decent joystick,"Joystick seems to work well, but it's a little light, so if you are rough with the joystick, this may not be perfect controller for you. Also, the joystick itself is only about 1-2 inches, so it's pretty small and may be different from what you are used to when using a slightly longer stick. But is works well and is a GREAT buy when it's around $20!!!"
5,Compatible with Windows 7 64-bit system,"I'm giving it a 5 star because I run Windows 7 64-bit edition on my PC and all you need to do is plug it in the computer and it will detect it with ease; no need to look for the driver. Compared to other Fight Sticks I read about that is a big hassle to install on the PC, this one is easy. Also it runs on wired USB, and is said to be 3m long. My main reason for buying this is so that I can use it for the games on my PC. Of course some games won't accept the Fight Stick 3 but if you know how to use ""xpadder"" you can configure it to work. It gets the job done but the only problem is the layout of the buttons is a little awkward. $40 is cheap if you are not a hardcore gamer; which cost up to $70(if it is on sale) and more."
2,poor qualiyi,"the sick is made of poor quality i had to open it up and replace a metal o ring wich holds the stick , i was on the middle of playing and next ting you know it was on my hand ,so i had to run to a hardware store and pick and metal o ring and put it back toghether"
2,Small PS3 Hori Fight Stick Review,"Ok where to begin. It's small, buttons are terrible, awkward feel to the stick, and oh yeah, WAY TOO LIGHT. Even if you are a beginner, Do not get this! Just save up for a Mad Catz or a Sanwa Hori Arcade Pro. Even though I started out using this and eventually got use to it, I threw it away and bought a Mad Catz TE. What a CHANGE it has brought to me. Executions became EASIER, rush down games were more in CONTROL, and you CAN'T COMPLAIN to you friends that the stick sucks, when you LOSE. Don't buy it and if you already did, you're going to regret it."
4,Nice stick for the price,This fight stick is pretty nice and great for the price. The one weird issue I have is that the stick is pretty loose feeling ( which is what a lot of other reviewers have said) but then after playing for about 10 mins with the fight stick on my lap the stick begins to become tight and feel like it should. I was wondering if anyone else had experienced this. It might be due to the bottom of the fight stick is made of metal and its really cold when I start playing and after having it on my lap it warms up. I haven't opened the fight stick up but it feels like all of a sudden the springs start engaging the stick closer to it and making it more firm which is cool but I haven't heard anyone else talk about this issue. Maybe I am the only one who has a stick that starts out loose and gets more stiff and precise after 10 mins. If anyone else has this issue please reply to my review. Thanks.
5,Great product for a great price,This product is a great installment for the ps3 . I'm able to performed better in psn arcade games and in street fighter with this arcade stick. The Stick it self overall is a well made product and so far it hasn't let me down . The buttons feel great and better then the mad cat version . Also the joystick feels durable and able to handle huge amount of playing hours with no difficulty .
4,Its so good I bought 2!,"It works great on Tekken DR, Virtua Fighter 5, Soul Calibur 3 (PS2), and Mortal Kombat 2 (PSN). I ordered 1 at first then when I got it I had so much fun playing with my friends that I bought another one so we could play those fighting games the way they were ment to be played.....WITH A JOYSTICK! This is a great buy for the price."
4,must have controller for virtua fighter 5 for ps3,"this makes virtua fighter 5 for ps3 much better. If you like that game I recommend buying this.This stick makes the combos so much easier to do.The stick works great for using the xmb and shutting down the system.My only gripe, but it may be a VF5 issue is that the stick seems to sensitive, you need to press things lightly to get the combos right."
4,PS3 Joy Stick,"This joy stick is great for the price, and perfect for casual play. Great for the price. I bought it to casuallly play my fiance in fighting games, and so far I am very happy with the product. It's been working really well too! However, I wouldn't recommend this for hard core gamers because the button placement is awkward for the hands, and the stick is also a bit small. If you're looking for a great joy stick, I recommend the Street Fighter 4 black arcade stick (not the white one, they're known for being breaking down)."
2,Hori Fight Stick is of Poor Quality,"If you want to jump into fighting games, do not buy this stick. The triangle button on my stick started acting up early on and stopped working after 2 months or so. If one button is messed up then this stick is rendered useless, unless you know how to replace buttons. A $40 investment is simply not worth it for a couple of months. You're better off buying the SF4 Round 2 FightSticks and dropping ~$120 for a stick that has sanwa buttons and will last you indefinitely."
4,not bad with this price,"I bought this for $50 with shipping. It arrived in a good package and the construction is fine and it feels good. I tried my friend's original street fighter joystick, which is worth $150 (the white one with street fighter logo and picture background). I don't see the huge different, of course, the one from Japan is better in terms of the build and feel and the size is bigger, but to me, as a normal player, I believe this one does the job well with this price tag."
4,"Well, it's not a game but...","The controller is nice. Solid construction makes for a nice hefty feeling although the stick itself is a little ""loose"" feeling for my personal taste. A must for anyone who likes to play fight games. I got it to play Tekken 5 DR Online."
1,horrible product,this stick will have a unresponsive triangle button within your first month of playing so good luck with this i don't advise it to anyone ... if your not going to get a TE stick don't buy one at all!
3,expensive piece of cloth!,"The pillow doesn't really fit in the compartment in the pillow case. I couldn't really work out to squeeze it in.Note that you cannot really buy the matching pillow without a pillow case, which makes it one very expensive pillow.The pillow case itself is OK - I suppose I was expecting something a bit less ""shiny"" and more ""cotton""."
4,A view at a world most of us don't see.,"Although the writing is not the most polished this book has a lot of information that will be new to the neophyte espionage readers and even manages to sneak in a few things that are very good for every day life that most of us either don't know or ignore. It is written from a very personal point of view, as if the author was just sitting in your living room and was an acquaintance. The problem I find with that is that most people, including myself, will take anything someone we don't really know with a grain of salt and this takes away from the book; there's a point in the book where you begin to doubt the veracity of it. Most of the non-espionage claims can be authenticated easily enough but there's a lingering doubt as to the participation of the author in these events the way he described it. The book is worth reading."
5,Need more than one!,"I purchased one of these a few months ago and so many people have asked me where I got it from that I ordered three more to give as gifts. If you are a reader, or know someone who is, this is a must-have tool to read while exercising."
3,FlipKlip Bookholder,"It works. Not the easiest gadget to use on an elliptical or treadmill. You must slide the next page out from under one holder, turn the page, and place it under the opposite holder. Not always easy to do without lifting the left holder slightly. However, it allows you to read while working out, without holding the book open yourself. It works better then any bookholder that I have found to date."
5,The Best Patsy Cline Sound Alike I Have Ever Heard,"I am from Jacksonville, Fl and Gail Bliss has done two sold out shows called "" A Closer Walk With Patsy Cline"". I went to both sold out shows at the dinner theater and it was the best show I have ever seen. You can close your eyes and swear that you were listening to Patsy Cline herself I also bought the CD of Gail Bliss and Patsy Cline and you can not tell where Gail Believe ends and Patsy begins. I recomend this CD to everyone who has ever heard Patsy Cline. Believe me I am not the only that feels this way for the two shows there were five couples with me each time I went and three of the couples had seen the show twice so again I urge everyone to go out and buy this CD. Your Truely, Sharon Seidel Jacksonville, Fl."
3,good & bad,"fits on the arm nice and comfortable (which is sometimes hard to find for women). the rubber cover fits well on the nano, easy to put on, and keeps it protected. only problem is, after popping it in and out of plastic arm band case the rubber starts to deteriorate a little. i think they should give you a couple rubber cases to go with it, since those are probably cheap. Tho I like it, I would probably try to find a different band next time."
3,"Not bad, but a little stiff","I bought this so I could move my video camera around while recording action, but it is either too tight and jerks, or too loose and I may as well be holding it freehand. If I were taking still pictures, I would absolutely love it."
1,Never received,"I never actually received this item, as it wasn't in stock with the reseller.It had already been discontinued."
4,I'll Never Go Back,After years and years of shooting with a regular head this was my first experience with a ball. It's great! This particular one works very well. My only complaint is that it's a little heavy. I cart it up and down mountains with my tripod (also a Bogen-Manfrotto) and I wish it were as light as the super expensive ones.
4,"Good, sturdy, basic ball head.","I bought this as the mounting ball for my Manfrotto 190XDB3 tripod. It is very solid/sturdy. The rapid release feature is great/convenient. The head is able to rotate 360 degrees and will also tilt over 90 degrees for vertical shots. I guess my only complaints could be (1) there is no built in level if you are set up on an uneven surface, and (2) it would have been nice if there was some way to know when you have the top of the head back in the straight upright center position again, like a groove or click that lets you know so you don't have to guess."
5,Nice ball head,"I find this ball head easy to use. This is my first one and I love using it. I'm sure the more expensive heads are better, but this one works great for me."
5,Great for motorcycles.,"I bought this to mount a video camera to my motorcycle. Works well, and I can take camera easily when I stop. Very rugged and heavy.Edit: This thing has been on my bike for three months now. Much rain. It still moves as smoothly as when it was new. It appears to be weatherproof. Very high quality."
3,Good for the money.,"This ball head does a good job for the money. I would eventually like to get a Markins, but that will be a large chunk of cash."
2,EACH EPISODE HAS SCRAPPY IN IT!!!,"""Nutcracker Scoob"" is about a three stars since it has the whole gang. It is a good one with Scrappy and the ghost is believeable. Younger children would enjoy the plot, but everyone else will think it is a bore. The second episode ""Alaskan King Coward"" has no plot and is a one star. It only involves Scooby, Shaggy, and Scrappy and it is only like 10 minutes long."
1,This gets bad,"This is one of the worst Scooby videos I have ever seen. The animation was really poor quality and the plot silly. My kids are big Scooby fans but even they only watch this video rarely. If you liked Scrabby doo maybe it will appeal to you, but for those of us who grew up with Scobby, this is a thumbs down Scrabby toon."
1,A Travesty for Any Real Scooby Fan!,"Two words--Scrappy Doo. And where is Velma? Even my 4-year-old got tired of this one after a couple of viewings. If you're not sure whether to get this one or not, do your wallet a favor and rent it first!"
1,Too much Scrappy,"This is one of the worst compilations of episiodes I have ever seen, There is no reason for Scrappy Doo, these would be good episodes if it wasn't for him."
5,Can't I give it 10 stars??,"We LOVE this CD!!!! We got it only by chance when I purchased a computer game for my baby (who is now 4). This was included in it, and we listened to it 'just because.'It is simply fabulous. The music is engaging enough for babies, and for adults as well. My little one STILL loves it, and now sings along with it and knows all the words.This cd is right up there with all the current favorites (Raffi, Laurie Berkner etc) in quality, and to be honest, I think Lisa Atkinson got a raw deal without getting any offers from Nick Jr!!!!"
2,disappointed,This was very disappointing because it arrived missing 2 of the little yellow bee guards. They had to know they were missing when it was sent and I thoroughly searched the packing to make sure they hadn't just fallen off and they just weren't there. I will avoid this source in the future.
5,Our Hummers Love this Model!,"We've tried a lot of models; expensive, ornate, etc. Our hummers turned up their beaks at all of them except this model. We've enjoyed many hours watching them land on the perches to feed. The only downfall is the plastic doesn't last and we have to replace the feeder usually yearly. Fortunately they aren't overly expensive."
5,Really Nice!,I bought this because I had one previously that I bought from Target. It got old so I had to replace it with a new one. I was surprised this looks identical to the one I bought at Target but it was much better quality and all the hummingbirds loved it!!
3,It's okay,"It drips red coloring all over our stairs. We wanted to see if one of these would work for the hummers in our neighborhood. Since it did, we will be purchasing a nicer, more reliable one that doesn't leak."
4,Perky-Pet Hummingbird feeder,"Generally the birds love it. I am filling more frequently than my old feeder even though it was much smaller, so Perky-Pet must be attracting birds from a wider area.As some minor problems, the birds have a hard time getting through the bee protector, so I removed some of them and cut the screen off others leaving only the yellow base which looks like a part of a flower.Also the perch must be glued on to keep it from rotating out of allignment with the flowers. Even without the perchs, the birds have no trouble feeding, provided the bee protector is removed or cut back.Definitely worth the money."
1,"Bad design, leaks constantly","This feeder is the worst one I've ever used. The ""flowers"" (dispensers) are way too low, so that the slightest breeze will cause the feeder to leak."
1,"no manual, cheap construction","I'll have to echo the other bad reviews on this item. Unfortunately, I did not read them before purchasing. Assembling a hummingbird feeder should not be difficult and probably shouldn't require an instruction sheet. However, this feeder was frustrating to assemble. There wasn't even a picture on the box. It's also hard to fill and clean. It looks cheap and I really don't expect it to last very long."
2,unusable,"This style of hummingbird feeder is the birds' favorite by far, so when my husband broke our feeder i immediately ordered two of the same type. Each feeder is supposed to have 4 yellow bee guards for a total of eight. These feeders were shipped with only six! Each feeder was missing a crucial component - so back they went! I also found these $3 cheaper at my local PetSmart and incurred no shipping charges either."
3,Not so good !,The glasss part of the bird feeders are made well but the flower that goes around the feeder where the birds eat is made very thin and does not fit well very sloppy on the feeder. I have many of the older ones and they were well made . I was replacing them as needed but these are nothing like the older ones some of the ones we have are 15 years old and these will never make it that long . So be prepared when you get these that they are not that great and fit together poorly. They also tend to leak because of the bad fit. The ants love them when they leak on the ground .:)
2,It's a Pain to Clean,I've had several Perky Pet hummingbird feeders over the years. They do attract hummingbirds but are notorious to keep clean. I mix my own nectar and maintain my feeders on a weekly basis. It got to be such a chore with the Perky Pet feeders I almost gave up. Then I heard a local hummingbird expert mention the Dr. JB feeder. Now it's the only hummingbird feeder I recommend. So simple to fill and clean. A much better choice for me.
3,Hummingbirds & Orioles love this feeder,"Hummingbirds and Orioles constantly visit this Droll Yankees feeder. In fact, one hummer likes it so much he tries to chase all of the other potential feeders away. We generally have to refill it every other day during the summer. It does have a few problems, though:--The yellow centers over the feeding tubes are easy to pull out, as the orioles soon discovered. The first thing they do after landing on one of the protruding 'flowers' is lever out the yellow mesh insert with their beak. We tried to counter this behavior by putting up an oriole feeder, but they ignore it and continue to return to the Droll Yankees feeder. (sigh).--If this feeder is allowed to sway in the wind, it drips. It needs to be absolutely vertical.--It is a bit messy to refill because of the dripping problem. We solved this inconvenience by bagging the feeder in plastic before bringing it inside for a refill."
1,attracts ants does not keep them away,"purchased to hang on giant wisteria that does sometimes get ants on it. liked the look of it also. hung up with my 2 other feeders & this 1 was almost instantly covered with dead ants floating in it. moved 1 of the other feeders to check that it wasn't the spot it was hung in, & viola no ants. nice idea tho. of all hummingbird feeders, i have learned that ""Best 1"" glass feeders are the best no doubt.Gotta love amazon tho. Couldnt have made return easier"
4,Easy care,This feeder is very easy to fill and clean. Be sure to provide another type for the orioles as they will come to this one and pull out the bee guards. Also be prepared for a visit from ants. Just the right size and will last 2-3 days even in August when they are filling up for their trip.
2,Won't Last Long!,"Seems great at first... until...- Sugar water spashes out every time you invert-Hummingbirds will rip off the bee guards, loosening them-**The plastic washer thingie will get stripped, and the whole thing will start leaking. If you're very unlucky, you will invert it, and the entire bottom will fall off, and all of the sugar water will spill out, and your loose bee guards will roll all over.*-Bees and wasps now are all over the place, annoying me and the hummingbirds.-Apparently sugar water on your feet can take the paint off your balcony.Keep in mind, I have a LOT of hummingbirds and I'm refilling mine every 2 days. My 2 feeders died after only a couple months. Going to get the flying saucer shaped ones.Maybe this would be OK for a low-traffic area."
2,Perky Pet Clinched waist Hummingbird Feeders,"All Perky Pet glass, clinched waist feeders have an inner part that connects the red bottom to the feeder itself - it's a circular small plastic insert with threads that screw on the bottle top. In every feeder I have bought this part seems to shrink in a very short time and then the bottom falls off the feeder. I wrote Perky Pets and they said they do not have replacement parts for hummingbird feeders so I give this feeder and the whole company a big F. It's a lousy product and the company won't back themselves up."
3,2nd Time is Better,"I recieved this item in one piece out of original packaging the first time and it was missing a yellow screen in the middle. I sent it back for replacement and received a nice packaged, you put it together, new labels, etc. and all parts intact. What I'm wondering is, did somebody try to pawn off an old returned item the first time, or did they try and help out by putting it all together before they sent it out and just left out an item. I hope it was the later. As for the feeder, it's great, I busted my old one I bought somewhere else."
4,really attracts hummingbirds,"Very bright and really attracts the hummingbirds. Before I hung it up I would see a hummingbird once a year; now I've seen two at a time on the feeder. I do have a problem with the feeder, viz., it's a bit tough to clean, and I do need to clean it as it's close to other bird feeders. However, I would definitely buy it again.I've been using sugar water (2 pts water, 1 part sugar), refilling once a week."
4,Great gift,"I gave this as a gift to my grandma for Christmas, she loves to watch the hummingbirds fly around and feed. This one has the beeguards so bees and wasps can't get into it."
5,tap tap tap,"Took a while, but the humming birds finally found the feeder. I'm hoping we're on next years rotation and they tell their friends. I had no idea humming birds were attracted to red..."
2,Missing parts,"Product was received with 2 bee guards missing. There should have been 4 total but only received 2 loose in the box. It is not convenient to return this item since it was part of a larger shipment, low price,repackaging,... Additionally, it is probably easier for me to purchase a set of 4 replacements from my local Wal-Mart... than to go through the hassle."
4,pretty nice hummingbird feeder,"This hummingbird feeder works better than any I have ever tried. I keep it close to red flowers and it is even better. I had an item like this for several years, then it starting to leak. Worth the money."
4,Perfect except one built-in bee guard was missing,"When I received my Perky-Pet Hummingbird Feeder, it had one of the middle yellow parts missing (I'm assuming that's the ""built-in bee guard""). This is really disappointing to me because I had a lot of hummingbirds and this leaves me with one less being able to use this."
1,Cheaply Made,We ordered two from Amazon based upon the reputation of the company and pictures presented. Totally disappointed with the total lack of quality. The price is low because of the low quality of materials used. Bottomline is that a 'good' feeder cannot be purchased at this price. The units purchased leaked the sugar water all over our patio. The unit can be sold as an ant feeder. We returned the units.
5,Now I Gotta Go Find It Elsewhere??,"Aww man...I bought this about a month ago. Nothing was wrong with it, and the hummers love it. I was getting ready to order two more.How long before we can get it?"
5,"Excellent Feeder, No Problems!!","I purchased a pair of these feeders for my mom and so far she loves them and so do the birds. They are easy to take apart and fill with liquid and are also pretty easy to clean by just taking them apart and rinsing them off with some hot water.The only possible issue that I can see with this feeder is that the top part that has the hanger attached is not attached to the glass very securely, at least in my opinion. I can see it coming off if it were ever in some high winds or was pull on very forcefully.Otherwise I would gladly recommend this feeder to anyone looking for a good priced, high quality hummingbird feeder."
2,Less than Par,I'm disappointed in the quality of this product. It seemed to be just cheap plastic (the foot rests) and shipping was extremely slow.
3,Missing Yellow Insert.,The product was fine... except for one of the yellow inserts of the flowers was missing. Not worth the hassle of returning it just for that but was disappointed none the less.
3,"Good, with some reservations.","It attracts my hummers, and because of the size the nectar doesn't have time to go bad. Bit of a pain to clean."
2,my leaking feeder,"I have purchased previously this item and have been happy with it. This particular feeder has begun to continually leak through one of the blossoms,,,, emptying out in about 2 days. I am dissapointed with this feeder since I am now unable to use it after only about 2 months."
5,Simple design makes for the best feeder,"I have been very pleased with this feeder. It took the hummers 2 days to discover it and now the birch tree where I hung it is literally the neighborhood ""hummingbird hangout."" I have even seen hummingbirds hovering in line to use it like airplanes waiting to land on the runway. I'm thinking of getting a 2nd one just to handle the demand now. You won't be disappointed with this purchase if your goal is to feed the hummers, not add a backyard ornament. Also, enjoy my customer images!"
3,"After ""All Videos Ever Made""","I used to be a huge Roxette fan. But... well... 2 albums of the greatest hits in a row is a sign of weakness to me. IMHO. Again, I hated the idea of releasing this DVD as a copy of ""All Videos Ever Made"" and adding just a couple of the latest singles to the collection, especially when one of them is a cartoon :). Well, what can I say, add some live performances, maybe additional interview? A postcard? A pin? Man, something that will make me buy this compilation and throw away the old one. Or the video version of ""It must have been lunch"" without the movie parts (VHS version). OR at least do the video Megamix. Don't throw a couple of singles on top of the old release and expect us to buy it."
2,Below Average,There is one good live performance of Listen to Your Heart. The rest of it is not that interesting. Not a keeper. Most of the videos focus on the guitar player and backup singer rather than Roxette for some reason.
4,even for non fans a find,"well from some of the above reviews peope may not be inclined to buy this dvd. Let me be the first to say that I just got my NTSC < usa formatted> dvd from the canadian distributor today and its GREAT!. The new menus and image layout are perfect, the supposed VHS tape quality that people complain about in their earlier videos is non-existent, and the only audio issues my dvd had was the horrible 5 second audio synch delay in the documentary really roxette, its kinda like watching overdubbed japanese movies. But overall in terms of content fans and non fans will enjoy all the new videos and videos that never made a mark here in the states. 4 stars for content woulda made 5 if someone would fix the audio synch."
2,DISSAPOINTED !!!,"I don't believe i got dissapointed of this DVD. It's full of technicals mistakes !!!!The screen blinks in almost every video and the documentary REALLY ROXETTE has a serious sync problem, meanwhile you're listening ""audio"" the video goes 3 or 4 secs delayed !!!!I'm a really hugh fan of Roxette but i'm really dissapointed with this DVD, so i recommend not to buy it. There's a DVD (released on 2001) called ALL THE VIDEOS EVER MADE and don't have all this technicals problems but there is only one detail, IT'S PAL FORMAT, so if your dvd runs this format go and get this dvd, you can get it right here on AMAZON UNITED KINGDOM or GERMANY. So, my commentary about ""Ballad & Pop Hits - The Complete Video Collection"" is VERY DISSAPOINTED !!!!!!!"
4,Great content,"Roxette has been one of my favorite bands. All the hits are here. My only complaint is that the aspect ratio is 4:3. If it was widescreen, I would have given it a 5."
5,ROXETTE - PAST AND PRESENT IN YOUR HANDS !!!,"Roxette is one of the most influential duos on the face of this planet, this DVD covers every single hit they made, plus newest videos and some of their spanish language videos, as far as quality of the DVD : newer videos have great sound and picture, older songs sound so so, but it's not that bad really, the main thing is, now you can hold in your arms the proof of Roxette's strong existence in the world of music,"
4,A Roxette fan's must buy,"As other reviews have mentioned, the quality of the older Roxette videos (The Look, Listen to Your Heart) suggests that they were taken right off of the 1989 VHS tape (rather than from a digitally remastered copy). That being said, as a long-time fan of the group I was mesmerized by the more recent ballad videos. They look and sound excellent (Marie Fredrickson is as beautiful as ever, which may be one reason I loved the group as a teenager); also interesting to see the evolution of Marie Fredrickson's hair from the mid-80s to the present day. It is too bad that Roxette's music isn't sold or played in the USA much anymore. Largely because of that fact, as a US fan of the group I consider this DVD a must buy."
2,What a Letdown,"The ""Roxette: Ballad & Pop Hits"" dvd suffers from what I suppose is poor manufacturing. The volume increases and decreases in level at random times and the sound for the documentary ""Really Roxette"" is badly out of synch.If you really have to have the videos in NTSC format, you should buy this, but be prepared for some disappointment."
2,This is an OK game,I thought this game was not the best in the world. The graphics were not the best (nothing to special) but they were exceptible. I didn't think it was very good though.
2,Good 4 out of 5 times...then never again. Too Expen$ive!,"The sound was good, but not great. Definitely better than standard i-Pod style earbuds. About the 5th time using them, however, one side began to fail and then quit all together. I returned them and do not plan to spend this amount of money (TOO MUCH) for earbuds again."
2,mono sound,I've had my V-Modas for less than one year and already the wire coming out the back connector is loose so sound only comes out of the right ear bud. This is under normal conditions of me listening to my music at work.
2,Not so great,Bass response is far less than hoped for. These ear buds are on par with others I have purchased in the $25 range. Vinyl wire insulation smells like skunk.
4,"Stay in the ears well, look good","Got these for the gym, and for listening to webcasts at work. Certainly work as advertised for earbuds--they stay in the ears very well. As far as sound quality, it's okay to good. Not sure if I have to adjust somthing, but I'm not blown away by the sound quality. I like my Sennheiser PX 100 Headphones much better for sound, but not for bulk.Aesthetically, I think they are the sharpest earbuds on the market. Overall, I'm very pleased with the product."
3,works great but is not designed for the iPhone as intended,"Hi,I bought this item to replace the standard earbuds on the iPhone. Although it said it was compatible with the iPhone, the jack does not fit correctly in the iPhone. Don't get me wrong, it does work but you have to force a little to insert it as the jack for the iPhone is a little less big than the standard jack. Other than than, I am very satisfied with the item."
3,Fabulous Sound...Dissapointing Lifespan,"I initially purchased these earbuds in October of 2007. Never having heard of V-moda I was hesitant to buy from them, but product reviews were excellent, so I took a chance on them. I was pleased with the sound quality and thoroughly enjoyed the earbuds. In August of 2008 the connections became faulty. They were under warranty and V-moda replaced them quickly. In January 2009, the connections in the replacement pair became faulty. The first pair lasted ten months and the second a mere five. I am unimpressed by the short lifespans of the two pairs I have owned. As much as I enjoyed them, I will look elsewhere for my next pair."
1,Only if they worked.,"If you look at most of the reviews at [...] they speak the truth. They are nice looking but don't last. My pair lasted about 4 months before dying and I keep reading that the replacement pairs are just as bad so it gives me little hope.So keep you money. I paid over 100 for these so they are cheaper here but they still will die on you. I'm not sure how this company is still in business with these faulty headphones and multiple complaints. I'm just it's not like that for everyone but considering how many bad reviews there are for this item, I wouldn't take the chance."
3,bass is not good!,It is a good headphone but I have to say it is not good for hearing the bass part of the music. You will hear a little cacophony when you liten to the rock music.
5,Slow start...great finish,"Hello everyone. I've never written a review, but I think these V-MODA Vibe Earbuds totally deserve some recognition. I tested these earbuds right out of the box and was a bit disappointed. It did sound nice, but didn't meet my expectations at all. I thought to myself, ""more money down the drain"". But I remember from other reviews that you need to break these earbuds in. So I did, just let it run for a few hours. Used it again and it was like night and day. The bass is awesome, the treble is clean. Well worth every penny. Slow start with a great finish."
4,As good as my Shure e3c.,"I listened to the advice of other reviewers and broke these in for about ten hours or so.They sound really good,good bass,accurate,and nice treble.But I haven't heard the truly high-end earphones so I gave a four instead of a five.The band ""Tool"" sounds great on these.So does Neil Young and all of the rock I listen to.They are comforatable(I use the largest ear pieces)and worth the price.Give them a try and they won't dissapoint."
2,"Sounds Very Good, But Cheaply Made","I had purchased and received my earbuds within three days. I was happy with the same day shipment, but not the overall product. I had purchased the pair based up rave reviews, but was sincerely disappointed. The V-Moda Vibe earbuds were purchased to replace a pair of Shure 2c earphones.The Vibe earbuds took about two weeks to completely break in the bass. Once it was broken in, the pair sounded very good, well worth the $80.00. However, after using for three weeks, the left earbud died. No reason. One morning I just put them on as usual and they did not work properly. I attempted to use the pair of my ipod and sandisk sansa as well as a friend's ipod - no luck.I contacted V-Moda by e-mail and they gave me a return address to send the pair for an exchange. To this day two weeks later, no earplugs. I have contacted the company three times, but not a response.Next I purchase some Westones."
5,GREAT PRODUCT!,"These earbuds have added a wider range of sound than I could have imagined! Actual bass I can even FEEL and cuts the outside noise considerably. The range of three sizes (and two colors) of earbud covers makes for a snug fit, they do not fall out! The look is sleek too! The only things that are at all a little negative are that when you are inbetween songs/videos, the snug fit actually allows you to hear the cord bumping against you if you are active and the etched ""L"" and ""R"" is so hard to see that I had to put a black cover on the left and clear one on the right to make it easier. At the Amazon price, DON'T WAIT!"
4,"I love these cans, but....","The bass response is unmatched. Period. I have noise canceling, open air, and closed air high-end phones and the bass response from the Vibes is exquisite compared to these. I love the way they sound... when they sound.I returned my Amazon pair because of a faulty jack making one channel cut in and out randomly.I just got my RMA pair with the promise that they have refined their manufacturing process, but out of the box, one of the bass channels is dead. This makes the sound space sound lopsided and empty on one side. I'm returning those now. One good thing is that the RMA has been a simple process and without hassle."
2,Broke down within a year!,"I bought these earbuds in April 2007, and less than a year later, the cable got so damaged that the sound only came from the left side! This happened because I wrapped the cable around my ipod whenever I stored it, so the plastic wrap around the cable got damaged, and that was the beginning of the end. Granted, the sound was very good, but still, it's a whole lot of money to pay for a product that will last less than a year, and I don't see why they couldn't produce a more time- and use-resistant design!"
5,V-Moda Vibe - Excellent in-ear phones,"The V-Moda Vibes have amazing sound quality. They tend to be a little richer on the bottom end, which may not meet some peoples liking, but I find them well suited to most popular music as well as podcasts.Extremely well made. I would prefer if the earphone jack were at a right-angle, but you can't have everything."
4,"Excellent design, great sound","These headphones are nothing like what I expected, I've had a couple of other noise-isolation earbuds including the in-ear bose triport, but none of them sounded as good.The sound isolation is pretty good and the ear buds have a great sound. Although, I believe these buds do require burn-in as I have noticed the sound profile has significantly changed with usage.The sound is pretty well balanced, but the buds excel in ""bassy"" songs. The sound is adequate when you're listening to acoustic, but once again they do a great job when listening to jazz.Over all I think the sounds is great and is very well suited to all tastes of music."
3,Vmoda earbuds,"So far I really like these. I want to say that my old Sony MDR-EX71SLA sounded better... but I cannot do a side-by-side listening test.However the cord on these seems more durable, and they look cooler.I also like the centered cord (vs sony). In any case the fit and sound are a nice step up from the stock iPod earbuds. The price point is fair, since I did not want to go to to $100+ for any of the competing earbuds."
3,earbuds,It is a cheap pair of earbuds what more can you say. I use the Sony brand instead and they are much better but also cost more naturally so you get what you pay for
1,"Sounds good, but the cord is now broken","Think twice before getting these earbuds. Like the people reviewing before me. My cord just recently broke at the plug end.I like to wrap my cord around my mp3 player and stuff it in my pocket, backpack, bag, etc. but after a year or so of doing this. The cord starts to weaken and then it finally breaks at the plug end. So if you are one to do this, you might want to stop.I'm disappointed that I know have to buy a new pair. Looking at the newer v-moda models. It looks like they learned their lesson and now use a big plastic cap on the end.Here is a pic from another person's v-moda which is exactly what happened to mine.http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B000V5L5MG/ref=cm_ciu_pdp_images_3?ie=UTF8&index;=3"
1,cord breaks and earphone came apart,"i have to admit that the sound quality on these earbuds is absolutly great but thats only if your willing to put up with the disappiontment when they go wrong (which they will)the first thing to happen was the metal part of the earbud came apart at the black band you could put them back together but this kept happening until finaly the internal wire separated and there was no sound, luckily my friend was able to reattach the wire and sealed it up with some electronics silicone.then just as i was getting back into the swing of things i noticed that the chord was splitting near the jack, left and right cable separator and at the earbuds themselves. within a few weeks of noticing this the cable became worse and then the sound cut off completely.these are not worth the money when you could buy a pair of skullcandy inkd earbuds for just 12.99 and they are far more reliable."
5,Best in-ear phone you can buy at this price range,Very powerful bass response yet still keep the detail of the treble part.Better than Sony Ex90LP. The bass is even better than some of the headphone with much large diagram.
3,Thank you!,"The product is a little bit off of what I expected. However, I saw the price @ airport shopping vending machine was $99."
1,v-moda earbuds,i could not keep these earbuds in my ears. tried all sizes and not oneworked. they would fall out even if i was just sitting. they were alsovery uncomfortable. i sent them back in 24 hours.
3,Style = yes / Sound = no,"Bought these after the great reviews on Cnet. Was impressed with the build quality and modern styling. Within a few minutes of music, though, I was disappointed. I tried them back-to-back with my $50 Sony earbuds, and the Sony's sounded much fuller and have some 'thump'.The Vibe's sound is clear, detailed and articulate, but very compressed and tinney. Also, the 'sleek' plug is a bit difficult to grasp when unplugging.If you're into vocal and/or pop music, thses might work. If you want a full sound, skip these.Think small boom-box vs. home stereo w/ sub.I'm returning these."
2,Won't last long!,Not a lasting set of ear buds. Mine did work longer than most but finally failed in the same manner as all others I've read about. One earpiece is barely audible now. Don't bother asking V-Moda if they offer any repair as they don't. I lasted out the one year warranty though...lucky me. They sound great while they last but I'd recommend buying something else as these aren't worth the price.
2,good sound lacking durability,"These headphones are great sounding. I bought them as my first pair of headphones over $40, because i needed something that was strong enough to block out the subway train rattling on my commute to school. I loved them when i first began listening, the bass was warm, the vocals were crisp and clear. But then a week later one earphone gradually faded, and stopped working. I returned them to the store for a second pair, which did the same thing after a week of use. As did the third.I am now on my 4th pair, and i dreadfully wish i could just get my 100 bucks back. I'm stuck with these stupid things and it's been over 30 days, so now i must mail them into v-moda to get them replaced. What a pain!If you are interested in these headphones, i would only recommend them if you are not going to be walking, jogging, or running with them. They are not durable enough to wear while active. not at all."
2,"Lovely sound, horrible build quality","I bought a pair in January and loved them. Sound is as lovely as everyone describes. However, there are something seriously lacking in the build quality. The soft wires felt flimsy to me when I first opened it, but I thought I'd just take extra care.At 1 month of careful usage, the plastic-covered wires from earbuds downwards became so weather-hardened that I could almost use them as chopsticks, and makes it so the earbuds popped out at the slightest motion. At 2 months of careful usage, the wires had half-ripped from the plug--which I repaired the best I could with unsightly electrical tape. However, at 3rd month, the left bud fell completely off.I am very disappointed--it is one of the best-sounding phones I've ever had (I've owned both Grado s60 and s90, and sennheisers), but man, they need to do something about making this baby last!"
5,Looks great and sounds great!,Works as advertised. Looks great and sounds very good. A good all around sound quality that is not boomy or tinny sounding. Its comfortable to wear and do not have a fatiguing effect.Over all its a hugh quality product that I would recommend to others.
3,Not as good as I'd hoped.,"While these IEM's do have a good, tight sound, they were a little too tight, if that's possible. While the bass was good, the overall sound was just too thin for my tastes. If I cranked up the volume to the point were the mids and bass were where I wanted them, the highs were just too harsh.Supposedly, your supposed to let these ""burn in"" for several hours. Well, I've used them for at least 14 hours now and the overall sound is still too thin and harsh.Also, in noisy environments you really have to crank them which will make the highs pierce your brain.Clarity and tightness abound, so if that's what you are looking for, then these are your type of phones. But if you want any kind of fullness or boosted low end and noise cancellation, these are not the ones for you."
4,Worth the price,"These are very good. I'm not an audiophile, I don't strive for the best possible sound reproduction money can buy, I just want something that sounds good and feels comfortable, and these deliver. They are well made and will last longer than some of the cheap ones I've tried out. They fit better than most ear buds I've tried, and the multiple plug sizes in the box ensure you get a comfortable fit."
5,Great for commuters!,"I have a long commute to work everyday and these earphones are great! The original earphones my Ipod came with always hurt my ears as they are so big. These actually come with 3 different silicone plug sizes and they fit very comfortably. Aside from providing great sound quality, they also reduce unwanted noises considerably during my commute which makes my train ride that much more pleasant!"
4,Much better than $40 IEMs.,"Pros: They fit inside my ear, block incoming noise, are built tougher than others (both the cord and , look nice, aren't extremely expensive, the sound is excellent (crisp highs and mids paired with very good bass).Cons: The cord is short (no extender included), no clip to wear them without having them in your ears, would have preferred a hardshell case instead of a soft one.Overall: The only way to get better sound is to use over-ear-monitors or a premium stereo system. Regular open style headphones and earphones don't even come close. Considering the price, sound, size, and quality, I am very happy with these and would find it difficult to find something better."
1,Bum hardware?,"Got 15 days past end of product warranty and then in the jack gave out. Had generally liked them till I hit this snag. They've had a pretty easy life until now. Given the cost, I had hoped they would be more robust."
4,Well worth the price!,"Great sound, very comfortable, I think it would be hard to find another set of ear buds that sound as good as these, I use them at the gym, they are a little pricy but worth the cash."
1,Great sound and fit - BROKEN after mild usage,I'm mad they burned up when I plugged them into my iphone.They are about 3 years old but spent a lot of time not being used.I got about 3 months of real use out of them.But just at a desk.It better not have burned out my iphone port!!!
3,"Not bad, but overpriced","These sound good, although they add too much coloration to the sound. I also found that I simply don't like the feel of ear buds that stop up your ears completely.I recommend you save your money and pick up some Yuin PK3's as they cost 1/4 the price and sound much better."
3,okay product,"this is okay, the quality is better than apple earbuds, but i think that for the price, it is not worth it. I saw sony brand ear buds and skull candy ones that were for no more than $30 that seemed to be better quality. I would say that if you have the money to spend then, go ahead, but if you want something better and cheaper, get something else!"
4,How is it?,"great earbuds. good sound quality and durable, but cumbersome when storing and kinda makes your ears sore after prolonged use. overall good product though...-Venner"
5,Superior sound quality,"I got this for my iPod Touch. Sound quality is far better than the Apple earbuds for everything I've tried them with (rock, pop, hiphop, classical, voice, movies)."
3,A unique mix of handbell colors and timbres,"Deya Marshall is an ""American in Paris"" with a large collection of handbells from England, the Netherlands, and America. All of these bells are used, with their unique tone colors, to produce varied sounds and interesting melodies. At times the bells accompany a soprano, recorders, and other instruments. The sound is thin as the Ensemble is seven members. In all, an interesting recording showing yet another facet of the burgeoning world of handbell ringing."
5,magnificent,"This is one of the great recordings of Indian music. Don't let the fact that the artist is American, or the instrument is a western cello put you off thinking that this is somehow inauthentic. This is one of the most intense, strange, and beautiful recordings I have ever heard. There is absolutley nothing like it. Nancy Lesh is an extrordinary musician with complete command of her instument. Far more satisfying and intriguing than the vast majority of Indian recordings that are flooding the market today. She has absorbed this music completely. For anyone who has an interest in Indian music or in the cello in the hands of a rare master this is an absolute must."
5,Beautiful Everyday Service,"For this price, I was expecting plain but serviceable flatware. What a surprise! This flatware is not only elegant enough for formal dinners but heavy and durable enough for everyday use too. Not only does it have service for eight, but it includes a hostess set, extra teaspoons, ice tea spoons, and cocktail forks. The only drawback I've found is that you have to be careful to use non-lemon dishwashing soap."
